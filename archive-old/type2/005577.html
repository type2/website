Subject: Fuel Pump Replacement (Type 2 / 4)
Message-ID: &lt;00fb01be8a76$14bc2080$2ce4abc3_at_xohgoynt&gt;

Right, first off, thanks to everyone who replied to my query about the
mystery pipe on my fuel pump.  The long and the short of it is that I am
going to have to either rebuild or replace the fuel pump. (The van is a 1979
Type 2, the engine, so far as I understand it, is a Type 4 - the fuel pump
is outside the engine compartment, close to the flywheel on the right-hand
side of the vehicle).
Now I've got two books that go into this process and one says that removing
the pump without removing the engine is very difficult - not impossible but
tricky enough to make removing the engine the easier option.  The other book
makes no mention at all of removing the engine and implies that taking the
pump off is a straightforward procedure.  Book 2 also mentions the
possibility of rebuilding the pump using the rebuild kit, and claims that
this may be done with the pump still in the vehicle.  I would not be very
happy with that, because if I was going to rebuild the pump I'd like to do
it in my garage, in the light, away from the dread fuel lines, where I could
test it out properly.
I was wondering if anyone has experience of this procedure and could shed
any light on the subject.  Also, what is the best way to clamp fuel lines -
are there particular clamp specifically designed for the purpose or what.
I'm worried about damaging the lines.  Any advice at all which would relate
to this subject generally would be gratefully received.  Thanks all, and
take care.  From Bob.
