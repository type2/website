Subject: Flasher woes

What have I done?!?

Hope someone can help with this one:

I have a 71 bus and recently the turn signals and flashers stopped working. 
 All of them.  Even though it _did not_ look like a burned-out bulb was 
causing this (since the outage affected all flashing lights), I checked a 
couple of bulbs just to be sure.  They were OK.

Naturally (I think), I then strongly suspected the flasher unit itself. 
 (Oh, BTW, the fuses all were OK too).  So, I bought a 12V flasher that 
matched outwardly to the one that had been working.  In case you've never 
purchased one of these, it looks like the best you can do is match them up 
by looks.   There is no replacement guide at the FLAPS telling which ones 
fit which autos (that I know of).  Anyway, the one I was replacing (that 
had been working fine) was obviously a FLAPS universal one as well.

I put in the new flasher, tried the turn signal, and -- POP! the light and 
indicator blinked once then quit.  The POP was evidently from the new 
flasher.

Now for the really weird part.  The turn signals still do not work, and now 
the GEN light stays on.  If I try a turn signal, the fuel gauge needle pegs 
to 'E' until I turn the turn signal off.

The generator is still functioning, and all other electrics work OK.  But 
something is haunting the signal/flasher/fuel gauge/GEN light.  Even if I 
put the OLD flasher unit back in, I continue to have the weird problems.

Anyone have weird signal light experiences they'd like to share?

Thanks,

Ken
