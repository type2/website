Subject: sae 30w synthetic.....
Message-ID: &lt;40e3c552.2493b95b_at_aol_dot_com&gt;

having a good weekend??  i hope everyone is.  got the college world series 
here in omaha, ne.  50 yrs.running.   its our one claim to fame!!  

anyways...for those that are interested....( THIS IS NOT AN OIL FART..)....in 
synthetic oils, and who use them,  the question came up a week or so 
ago...someone was asking if there were more combinations of different weights 
in oil.
AMSOIL synthetics carry about any one you need,  even a SAE 30w full 
synthetic.
so for those who use and like synthetics check them out.  they have a web 
site.  or i can send (snail mail) you a catalog.  if you want a bit of a 
discount on their website prices ..(.not sure if they still offer this 
option)...but if it asks for a order #...type in #385 515.
