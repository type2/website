Subject: Fuel Leak
Content-Disposition: inline

I have a 77 Camper with EFI. The other day when I filled up the tank, fuel leaked out the driver side rear quarter panel (the opposite side from the filler). Inside the engine compartment I could not locate the leak. All of the fuel lines were perfectly dry, but the area where the 2nd battery should be had a fair amount of gasoline. 

Any idea what I should check?
Can I get to the tank without removing the engine?
