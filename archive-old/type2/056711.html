Subject: Cutting baltic birch

There was a thread before the list split about cutting baltic birch. I 
post this for what it's worth to loaf-owners:

I just cut several baltic birch panels (3mm or 1/8&quot;) for my bus. I used a
utility knife with a very sharp blade, and a straight edge. For rounded
corners, I cut freehand to within 1/16&quot;, then shaved. This is the way to
go. It requires a bit of effort, but there was no chipping. Just perfect,
clean, straight cuts. 

Oh, also I placed a piece of 3/4&quot; wood, 5&quot; inches wide and longer than 
the panel, under the cut. As I traced the cut, I used the board 
underneath as a fulcrum to open up the kerf. This worked great.
