&gt; The last VW Beetle will leave the production line in Puebla, Mexico at the
&gt; end of July, marking the end of a nearly 70-year history and more than
21.5
&gt; million cars, the newspaper said.


Huh...That is strange since they just introduced the convertable New Beetle.
I guess its going to be a limited run for the verts. I've seen only a couple
around here in Portland.
