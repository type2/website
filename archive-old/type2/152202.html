Subject: Re: [T2] bus accident

just to add in one thought,  gotta do this before an accident. I had my
car appraised and get an &quot;assigned value&quot; agreement with the insurance
company. you pay a little bit more but if your bus is in an accident the
&quot;assigned&quot; value is the value they have to work with.
