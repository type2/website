I was hoping I could learn about &quot;Total Seal Rings&quot; from an internet search. 
  Not so.  Here is what I got...

from  http://billetsource_dot_com/vw_pistons.htm

Ordinary piston rings cost you horsepower. Their secondary rings have an end 
gap that allows combustion gas to escape into the crankcase - the dreaded 
blowby.

You won't have blowby problems when you install Total Seal piston rings. The 
secret is in Total seal's secondary ring. It consists of a chrome-faced ring 
and an oversize cast iron ring that interlock to form a gapless seal. That 
seal gives Total Seal rings a leakdown rate of 2% or less. Compare that to 8 
- 10% leakdown rate for gapped piston rings.

There are two versions of Total Seal rings. The TSS rings are for street use 
and have a moly coated cast iron top ring. The TS1 rings for racing have a 
doctile iron top ring with a plasma/moly coating. Both ring sets have Total 
Seal's Gold Power oil control ring, a low tension ring that controls oil 
better and reduces friction up to 50%.

and

Total Seal Piston Rings 94mm  These replace the stock 2nd ring. They consist 
of two interlocking rings which overlap and eliminate the ring gap, which 
results in minimal blowby past the rings. This means more of the combustion 
pressure is used to push down the piston - more power. I've used them on 
several race engines and leakdown tests I've carried out prove they seal 
better than regular rings. Price is per set (4 pistons).

Price: 65 something   www.johnmaherracing.co_dot_uk/jmrshop/pistons.htm

Questions I have = do you get a full set of rings, or do you just get the 
compression ring??

Where can I get them for my 2 liter??

What's the draw backs, besides price??

TIA
