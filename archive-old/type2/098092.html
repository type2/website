&gt; Hey now,
&gt; The deal is he has a busted oil cooler or just bad seals for it and every
&gt; time he accelerates about a pint of oil gushes out of the fan shroud so he's
&gt; looking to get some ideas how to fix this.
&gt;
&gt; EMAIL me please with suggestions!

Sounds like your diagnosis is correct.  Buy a new cooler (get the right
kind for the engine and shroud) and seals.  Remove engine, remove tin,
replace cooler, replace tin, replace engine.

It _might_ be the seals only, but if you don't buy the cooler you won't
have one on the weekend!
