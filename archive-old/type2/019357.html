Same thing happened to me this weekend on a trip to West Virginia in my 71
Westy.  I poked around a little, and, after snapping the brush springs out and
back, the light went out - for a while.  It turned out to be the brushes in the
generator being worn down too far.  Once they were replaced, the generator
voltage was up to about 14.5 (normal), and no generator light.  You could see
pitting on the old brushes - a sign of intermittent contact.  Now my starter
seems to be gone, probably unrelated to the brushes, but maybe related to the
phase of the moon.

&gt; Same thing happened to me a year ago.  It was the voltage regulator.  The
&gt; good news is, they don't cost much and they aren't difficult to replace.

&gt; &gt; Intermittent red light on
&gt; &gt; On the way home from High Country Bus fest, My generator light came on
&gt; &gt; brightly. Fan belt fine. Started up, three miles down the road, back on.
&gt; &gt; Stayed off after restart, but I was only 2 miles from home. Any ideas?
&gt; &gt; Voltage regulator?All connections look fine, and was a very bright light.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; High Country Bus fest was GREAT. Hats off the Mike Myers and my buds from
&gt; &gt; the Full Moon Bus Club.
