&gt; Hello,

&gt; I have been searching for a 1972 VW P/U (Single or Double) for some time
&gt; now. But I have yet to find any in decent condition. Where are they? Were
&gt; they ever imported into North America?

Not many baywindow pickups were imported to the US.  IIRC, there was some
sort of tariff war that resulted in the price of VW pickups being
prohibative.  Most of the baywindow pickups in the US were originally
imported to Canada.  Japanese pickups avoided the tariff by being
imported as &quot;cab and chassis&quot; vehicles and then having their beds
installed in the US.  Unfortunately, VW pickups weren't built that way.
