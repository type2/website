Subject: [T2] Upper Trailing Arm Removal - Replacement

i also did the trailing arm &amp; ball joint replacement about a year ago &amp; yes,
there are a couple of things i ran into that did not turn up in my search
of the archives.  however, for me, removal was not the problem - it was
the installation of the new arms. after we had removed the rubber stops,
the upper arm was pried off rather easily using the handle from a floor
jack (about a 5 or 6 ft. lenght of pipe).

the biggest problem we ran into was the spot welds on the ends of the leaves
inside the beam. when the old arm is removed, the spot welds will break.
apparently some people have had luck using tape, wire, or some similar
method for  re-intstallation. we had no suck luck. we finally realized
that we would have to replace the spot welds in order for the leaves to align
with the grooves in the new arms. after the welds were replaced, the new arms
went on with relative easy. we used a foot long section of 4x4 &amp; placed that
on the arm instead of hitting it directly with the hammer.

i would be happy to collaborate with anyone else on getting a good article
into the library on this procedure. if anyone is interested please let
me know.
