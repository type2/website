Subject: CV Flopping

Just finished bonding with my CV's this past weekend ('80 Westi)
After cleaning, gooing, and assemblying 3 used CV's, started to 
re-assemble the 4th.  Lack of smooth movement of joint told me that 
it is NFG.  Go to other 4 CV's removed from other '80 and and start
disassemblying &amp; cleaning to find a useable joint.  Finally found one 
that didn't have huge pits in it.  Finally got them all installed.

Spent some quality time immersed in the workings of CV's to come to 
the following conclusion:

To re-use a CV and place wear surfaces on opposite sides of 
joints, switch the entire axle or CV's individually from Right axle to 
Left axle or vice versa.  Switching CV from inner to outer on the 
same axle wears joints on same surfaces.

Reversing the orientation of the same CV on the same place on the
same axle would have the same effect as switching from R to L.  
BUT, due to the asymmetrical nature of the parts, I am leery of 
doing this.  I am not sure the assembly can withstand the geometry 
involved.  Second thoughts on this leads me to believe that this would 
work.  Essentially it's putting the axle out the other side of the 
CV, and any angle acceptable from normal orientation would be the 
same angle from reversed orientation.  Anybody done this and can 
confirm that this would work? (I thought I saw a post on this)

Eric wrote  of his automatic transmission bus -
&gt; If my bus is typical, and not screwed up, one of my CV shafts is longer
&gt; than the other.  Well, one of mine is regardless of screwed upness.  But if
&gt; my bus is typical, then one of YOUR shafts is longer, too.  If you drop
&gt; them, you would do well to keep them straight.  This also means you cannot
&gt; switch sides with your CV joints.

In short, yes you can switch CV's from left axle to right axle, just 
be absolutely sure that the axles go back to the correct side (auto 
transmission).
FWFW, the manual transmission axles are the same length L &amp; R.
