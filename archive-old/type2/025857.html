Hi Volks,

Note: I have a VW Canada rebuilt 73 engine in my bus, running the original
dual carb setup, it has about 35000 miles on the rebuild.

Today while fussing in the garage I found a vacuum pipe I picked up off the
ground next to a 74 bus at a wreckers back in September. It fit real well,
and works much better than the rubber hose that the P.O. had fitted as its
replacement.

When I fired up the bus to see if the part made any significant difference
to the recent bog off-idle I discovered the exhaust was a lot louder with
the rear deck hatch opened. I reached down behind the left carb and
discovered a new draft.... a closer look with a flashlight revealed that the
exhaust recirculation port plug on number 3 cylinder had broken off right
down close to the block.

I broke all 4 of these off the wrecker motor I bought last fall when
removing its tin, and they were a ^%$ PITA to get out. Like the one I found
laying on the right side engine tin, they were all crimped off and brazed
closed.

Anybody know a source for these new?  Do I have to buy the original part and
have it brazed again, or is there a replacement that's already plugged?  VW
dealers around here look at you like you have two heads when you show up at
the parts counter looking for air-cooled parts, so I assume I'll be buying
mail order.

The other question is whether driving like this will damage the engine. I've
probably done 1500 miles like this already, getting to and from EB2001.

Happy trails,

Greg Potts
