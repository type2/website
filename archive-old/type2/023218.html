So is the CIS an advance over the stock '78 fuel injection? Mtock L-Jet 
system is working well and very reliable but anything that might help power 
would be, in my mind, an advance!!!

Okay take this one more step forward: which Type IV bus heads flowed the 
best? I think I read that the '73 dual carb heads had the largest valves of 
any of the busses. Anybody think this would lead to more power? Better or 
worse MPG?

Lastly - how wild a cam can you put with this CIS setup? I'm figuring that 
the OEM fuel injection cam was pretty tame and power/mpg/driver's smile 
could be improved with a slightly wilder cam. Would the GTI cam numbers 
have any bearing on the cam numbers for a bus engine running CIS? I'm not 
looking to ruin driveability just improve power/breathing and still be able 
to send the bus to the store with my wife.

Just curious!
