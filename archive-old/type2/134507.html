Subject: Re: [T2] Stolen Emblem/MTV Pimp My Ride

I don't think you can attributte the theft to MTV's Pimp My Ride bus episode
and I doubt the popularity will wear of soon as this phnomenon has been
going on for a couple of decades now.

Some people think VW Buses are cool, others just think the big ... VW emblem
is cool....

Sucks but be glad they didn't think the entire bus was cool enough to steal.
;-)
