Subject: fixing value tube leaks

I put new valve tube gaskets on, but a couple of them are leaking so my 
mechanic recommended that I use this on the gaskets and they won't leak:

anyone else try this stuff.  He says he also uses it on the valve covers 
because it doesn't stick to the metal.

thoughts?

Thanks!
Mike
