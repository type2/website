Subject: Re: Now what type of bus for Pat?

 Matthew,

     Well, that is a good question.  I have still not decided between a
Vanagon or Bay.  Both have their advantages &amp; disadvantages.  I like the
power of the bay but the room &amp; more stable ride in the Vanagon make it
attractive too.  This fire has nothing to do with which van I pick.  I was
having these thought as soon as I got sold the 82 Westy I had.  Vanagons are
also a bit easier to change the fuel lines on. :)  Depends on what the
insurance gives me.

&gt; so the question that has been on my mind for a few days is... what genre
&gt; of Type-2's or vanagons are you replacing this with?  Don't tell me you
&gt; are not replacing it....
