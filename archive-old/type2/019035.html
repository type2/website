Now the question to ask is, Okay, let's say the valve timing is off. Is
there anyway to fix that with the engine in the bus?


MY PREVIOUS POST: 

I figured even if the valve timing were off a couple notches (I did
align the gears up per the manual) that I'd get some compression. But
none? I does seem to have compression when I turn the engine over
manually. Arghh. I thought I'd query the list one more time before
pulling the engine again and going over it.

THE ANSWER THAT I RECEIVED:

Here is a quick test to check valve timing: Remove left, 3/4, valve
cover. Turn engine in direction of rotation and watch #3 valves. You
will see nothing move for a while. Then you will see the exhaust valve
open and close. Just as the exhaust closes the intake will start to
open. Stop. At the point of the exhaust closing and the intake opening
#1 should be at TDC and your timing mark should be on zero. If neither
happens, your cam timing is off.
