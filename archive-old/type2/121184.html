Subject: Re: [T2] Help with buying brass drift for wheel bearing race

I can't imagine working on my bus without the internet.  I always know 
there are helpful people that have been through what I haven't.   I 
ended up punching out the old races with a plain steel punch.  It was 
nerve racking but uneventful.  I heated the hub and cooled the new races 
a little before installing. They banged right in.  The tool set Autozone 
loaned me looks identical to the Lisle 12600 set you mention, Richard.  
The Timken bearings I got are all made in Poland.

I placed an order with Cip1 last night.  They had a 10% off weekend 
sale, with their standard free shipping.  Highlights include a rear 
shift rod coupler, steering coupler, and KYB GR-2 (front) and Gas A Just 
(rear) shocks.  I am looking through the archives for the NXXXXX part 
numbers for the shock mounting bolts, washers, and nuts.  Does anyone 
know these part numbers?  Well, I'm off to get ready for work.  Thanks 
everyone, and have a (air) cool week!
