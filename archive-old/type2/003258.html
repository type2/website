I can either take a pic of one.....or send it to you.....your choice:)

Your fuse box should have # 411 937 505C on it, correct?
The way this bracket is made....I doubt you could duplicate it.

&gt; In the span of 29 years since my bus rolled off the production line, there
&gt; have been many modifications (mostly detrimental) made to my '72 by its
&gt; previous owners.  The one that is causing me the most worry is the
complete
&gt; lack of any mounting bracket for the fuse block.  The entire fuse assembly
&gt; is hanging from a string tied around the steering column.  While there is
no
&gt; apparent immediate danger of grounding or shorting against any nearby
metal,
&gt; I know this is not right and want to fix it as soon as possible.  This
&gt; should be the last of my interior work before the bus becomes a daily
&gt; driver.  I have searched the archives a bit to try to find a picture of
the
&gt; original mounting bracket and location, but can't find any info.  Can this
&gt; part be purchased, or should I try to fabricate my own?  Donor busses are
&gt; very rare in my area (seacoast of NH).  If anybody knows where I can find
a
&gt; good photo for fabrication purposes, or can steer me to the right part, I
&gt; would be very appreciative.
