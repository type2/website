Subject: I Should Have Posted This...

   ...about a month ago.

   I am negligent in not sharing this with the group after putting you all 
through the drama last September. Our beloved '69 Westy &quot;Patience&quot; is back 
in our possetion and running after breaking down on the first third of a 
cross-country move from Oregon to North Carolina.

   The rough story and pix are here:

   As always, endless thanks to Troy and Leah who not only towed my bus 
across Colorado and put me up in their home for a week, but then towed our 
poor, broken bus another 2000 miles to get it back to us. Huge thanks to Don 
also for great sacrifice of time, energy, and a very nice muffler!

   You all rock!
