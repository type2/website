&gt;I am trying to replace my rear brake shoes and so far am getting nowhwere.
&gt;I cannot even losen my lug nuts!  I have sprayed WD40 on them and so far
nothing is &gt;working.

Sounds like your wheel lugs were tightened by an air wrench. Keep hitting
it with shots
of 40, then leave it soak as you run to sears and pick up a craftsman
breaker bar (1/2 in
drive) and perhaps a short half inch extension &amp; a socket to fit your lugs
if necessary)
then hit the lugs with another shot of 40 and run to the hardware store
with your breaker
bar and have them cut you 3 feet of pipe (make sure your breaker bar can
slide into the
end of the pipe) then come back and make sure your wheels are chocked and
your socket is
a smooth tight fit, then put on the breaker bar, slide on the 3 foot pipe
and apply your
weight to the extension pipe without hurting yourself. repeat as needed.
Next option would
be to go to a shop and have them remove the lugs with an air wrench. should
the lugs strip
you'll need to go back to sears for a 4 inch long cold chisel, a 5 lb.
sledge hammer and
some good goggles. Then you want to cut a deep groove into the lug then
change angles in the groove so you're pounding into the lug counter
clockwise (keep spraying 40) you'll get
it. when you retighten use only the breaker bar and pipe and your own
strength so that next
time you get a flat if in the wilderness you'll be able to wrench off the
lugs on your own.

&gt;The other thing is, a friend of mine told me I need to have a
&gt;special &quot;sping removal&quot; tool otherwise I will not be able to get the
&gt;springs off. Is this true?

It couldn't hurt to have that tool - which can also be had from sears, but
it's not impossible to improvise with a pair of regular pliers, needle nose
pliers and goggles.
good luck.
