Subject: Re: wood storage

.  Where do you all store your wood when you go
&gt;camping

This is obviously a Friday question. How curious though. Do people actually
haul wood around to make camp fires, and would they pay for it?

In England and much of Europe, if you're on a proper camp site you probably
can't light a fire anyway, other than a BBQ. If not you'd be sufficiently in
the wilderness to gather your own wood on arrival, if you think a fire is
necessary. Me, I've never lit a fire when out in my camper. Do other people
do this?
