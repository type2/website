Subject: Strange Generator light problem

Volks:

I went out to the bus this morning to take her in for new tires:).  When
I cranked her up the generator light stayed on(no prior problems).  I
shut her down, and grabbed the idiot book.  I then wiggled the wires on
the regulator and the light bulb socket.  Turned the key to the first
position (on, not start) and no generator light.  Proceeded to crank and
the light came back on.

I had to leave to go to work, but now can't stop thinking about it.

What am I looking at here?  New regulator?

Also, is it possible to rehab the tail light sockets?  I can't keep them
working.

TIA
