Subject: FS: 1964 21 Window - San Francisco

This vehicle parks down my street on weekends. Here's the info (verbatim)
from the sign in one of its many windows:

FOR SALE
1964 21 Window
$5,000 (firm)
new engine 1776 cc
new brakes, heat exchangers, tires, upholstry, etc.
415 398-7142 eves/wknds

Straight-looking body, no visible rust -- but I haven't looked underneath.
New-ish paint job, dark blue and white. At a glance, it's a sweet-looking ride.

Call him, not me.
