&gt; My experience with tools is that there is no middle ground between (a)
&gt; absolute crap and (b) good enough to use every day for years. And
&gt; really no way to tell the one from the other except through experience.
&gt; Some cheap things seem to do all I ever require of them; others fail
&gt; quickly and I go out and get something else. So, by buying cheap the
&gt; first time around and replacing the ones that are absolute crap with
&gt; something better, I figure I come out ahead in the end. But I can't
&gt; prove it.
&gt; 
&gt;    My guess would be a combination of labor costs and some country's
&quot;ignoring&quot; intellectual property ownership...If you don't hafta care a-
bout things like patents on designs, your R &amp; D costs can go way down...
just copy a successful tool and stick your name on it. If your labor
costs are so low, since you don't hafta include worker safety, health
benefits, pensions, etc. then you can sell it at a price that a first
world company can compete with...It usta be that tools (and other
products) could be purchased in various grades, ranging from utter
junk (remember when &quot;Made in Japan&quot; meant low buck ?-) to top of
the line stuff, that not only worked well, but looked and felt good to
use...
