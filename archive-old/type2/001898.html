&gt;Hi Andy
&gt;
&gt;You will probably get overwhelmed with requests,
&gt;...but I am looking for a complete set of engine tin.......

You are correct, I was overwhelmed with requests, and i tried to answer each
one of you  individualy. If I didn't, it was an oversight.

Bunny has asked me to post his toll free number, and he promises to try and
quickly answer all interested parties. the number is  1 877 563 7522. I will
try to follow up and make sure that things do in fact get shipped. If you
speak to Bunny and  he has something that you want, e-mail me and if
possible I will try to see that it gets on a truck headed your way. I did
not do an inventory, sorry. Perhaps the other Andy has a better idea of what
he saw there today. I did notice some tin,and four jalousie windows, and who
knows what else, like twenty or so heads, a bunch of brake stuff(I don't
know brakes),blocks and so on... He said he had some aux. gas heater suff,
but I didn't see any and frankly I dont think that I know what one looks
like. I asked about wiring harnesses(several volks were looking) and he
thought maybe if I dug through this crate or that one that maybe i could
find a few. I looked for a bit but embalmed puppies were enough to end my
search for the time being.  Call him up, he might have what you need.

thanks,
