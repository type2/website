If you're willing to work hard enough, you probably could rebuild an
engine without every removing it from the car! :-)

 However, in the long run it's just easier to drop the engine and tear
it down to the point where you can really see where this oil is coming
from.  It's *higher* numbers that indicate thicker oil (e.g., 50
weight is &quot;thicker&quot; than 30 weight) but you don't want to go this
route.

If it's not a really bad leak you may just want to live with it until
you can fix things properly.  Keep an eye on your oil during your trip
and be prepared to wash the back window regularly!

Subject: [T2] leaking oil cooler


&gt; I've discovered oil leaking from what appears to be the oil cooler
on my '81
&gt; westfalia.  I removed the bottom tin and it's not coming from the
push rod
&gt; tubes or the oil filter.  It seems to emanate from whereabouts the
oil
&gt; cooler attaches to the engine.  The engine was installed rebuilt in
&gt; February.  It only leaks oil when the engine sump oil gets up to
250F and
&gt; the engine is running.  Question:  is there a way I could tighten
the oil
&gt; cooler without removing the engine to try and stop this leaking?
Would a
&gt; thicker (lower number = thicker??) oil help?  I have not much time
to take
&gt; it to the shop as we're leaving on a west coast honeymoon road trip
next
&gt; Monday.
&gt;
&gt; Thanks in advance!
