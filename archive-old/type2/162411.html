I live in the Mid Atlantic area and ski so my bus runs year round from
bitter cold in the mountain ski resorts to the brutal heat and humidity
of a city in the summer...

went ALL synthetic a few years back

run Mobil 1  15w-50 year round, stays solid in the summer but still cranks
at 10 below.
also synthetic tranny final drive, auto tranny, brake fluid, even wheel
greese.

pretty soon getting a synthetic driver
