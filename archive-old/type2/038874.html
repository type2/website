Subject: Help Doktor Tim

Please be aware that I cannot distinguish whether my e-mail is forwarded by
the list or is a p-mail sent to me directly unless I open the message. This
means in the past that some p-mails have not been answered as I check the
subjects only before reading or deleting a message. I am certain that some
p-mails have been deleted. Please know that I have not knowingly or
willfully refused to respond to anyone. 

I simply do not have the time to open every e-mail to determine if it might
be p-mail unless I recognize the sender's name or the subject is of direct
interest to me. 

If you send me p-mail, put &quot;Help Doktor Tim&quot; or sum such in the subject and
I will surely read it and respond. Thank you for your understanding. 

Regards,



T.P. Stephens 
San Juan Island, WA
