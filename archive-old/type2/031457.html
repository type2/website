well a whole lot of folks will be able to help you with the engine, but
there are only a few of us with auto trannys on the list so

&gt; I have a 75 westy with an automatic transmission.  I am in the process of 
&gt; rebuilding the engine now and it seems everything is broke.  When I first 
&gt; bought it I brought it down to get looked over and the mechanic called me 
&gt; saying the gear box was filled with red transmission fluid, it was leaking 

???? not sure what you mean, the final drive had tranny fluid??

the gear box itself, the automatic transmission, is supposed to be full of
red tranny fluid (Dextron)

&gt; hundred miles before i started the rebuild.  When I pulled the engine I 
&gt; found that the cast iron casing that the engine is mounted to on the torque 
&gt; converter has a large chunck broke off (enough that one of the bolts does 
&gt; not have anything to connect to).  Anyway, I have a lot of decisions to make 

again not sure what part you mean, the torque convertor is connected to
the flex plate (which is connected to the crankshaft) by three tempered
bolts with large flanges on em...they go into a lug like projection on the
side of the torque converter,  if one of these is broken, the torque
converter is scrape metal, unless you are one heck of a weldor.  if you
are referring to one of the 4 mounting points for the engine to mount to
the tranny to hold them in the van, this may be fixable.

HOWEVER, from the sounds of things I would put feelers out for a good late
version bus AUTO tranny  76-79 with torque converter, you should be able
to find a decent one for $100-200 Don't mess with the early vacuum shift
auto trannies.

(ID, vacuum shift tranny's have a valve on the lower side of the tranny
that has a vacuum hose to the engine, shifting the tranny at the lever on
the side of the tranny it will move freely.
late Govenor shift tranny will have a &quot;can&quot; on the side of the tranny held
on by a bail sort of like the valve cover. moving the linkage lever on the
side of the tranny there will be noticable stops or detents, in fact you
may not be able to move it by hand.)

if you have the earlier type on your van, be sure to get the shifter from
the floor of the donor van as these are different, the rest is pretty much
interchangeable.

BUT, forget it, you cannot without a great deal of work switch to a manual
tranny, the buses are built as auto or manual when they come off the
assembly line many parts and mounting brackets are different

Good luck
