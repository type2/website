My vents smell also, having checked the fuel pipes to the carbs and replaced
them with propper fuel line clips (from the local diesel specialist!) I have
concuded that my worn twin carbs are resposible.

I notice Just Camperes do new ones for arounf UKP280, but I am going to
check with a local place first that rebuilds carbs..
