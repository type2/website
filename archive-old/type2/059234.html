&gt;What i am doing to solve this very expensive problem.  Is i am getting
&gt;all the
&gt;BIG cardboard boxes i can find.  BiG Refrigerator and TV boxes or try
&gt;your
&gt;friendly Local VW shop they get big boxes!  and i am going to cut them
&gt;up then put thompsons water seal on the backside and then spray paint
&gt;them grey.  I have all the chrome peices for a deluxe so i might stick
&gt;those in there to make it look better. to attack i am either going to
&gt;use duck tape on the backside or maybe some screws with big washers.
&gt;Cheap and you can make them easy.  replace them every 3-6 months.
unless
&gt;you have really crappy seals.

When converting my 7-passenger '78 to a camper, I replaced the crappy
naugahyde-ish panels back there with 1/4 oak plywood treated and stained
($13 for a 4x8' sheet).  I secured them with brass screws going through
into those little wedge drywall anchors (a cone cut into three prongs,
such that the screw expands them as it goes in).  The anchors for a #10
screw are almost an exact fit for the normal little holes in the body
(minor trimming required), and #10x3/4 brass flat head (with finishing
washers) wood screws worked best for most of my panels.  Since the
little anchor has a 1/8 - 3/16&quot; collar, I had to use a Dremel tool to
cut indents into the back of the plywood.  No big deal.  Dark stained
wood and brass screws make it look like a tacky bar, according to my
wife, but I like it and figure it's better than a tacky 70's bar (like
the old crap).

If anyone wants any other details, let me know.  I can scan  and post
pictures of how it looks, too.

Have fun,
