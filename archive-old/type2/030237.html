Subject: Disc brake spring clips: another VW design feature

I knew that my disc brake pads were getting a bit thin, but I didn't know
that the right side was just a bit thinner than the left side that I
inspected.  There was just a bit of the central groove left on 3 of the
four pads, and a tiny hint on the fourth.  This is further than I really
want to take them!

However, there is a clever VW design quirk that seems to be intended to
prevent the dreaded metal-to-metal contact if you let things go too far.
The spring clip that goes between the ears of the pads is just a bit wider
than the rotor itself, which means that it will hold the pads apart before
all the friction material is gone (assuming that both pads wear the same.

When the clip holds the pads apart, the brake on that side loses
effectiveness, since one side of the pad is being held apart by the clip.
the symptom is that the brakes start pulling toward the non-worn-out side.

You probably don't want to use this quirk as a indicator of worn-out
brakes, but it is an excellent thing to check if the brakes suddenly start
pulling to one side.
