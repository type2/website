Subject: lead additive (was unleaded fuel)...

As an aside to this thread, I was curious about the effectiveness of a
lead additive to the gas tank upon fill up (or every other fill up)?

My 1600 doesn't have any of the hardened valve seats (and isn't there
some type of sodium valves that server the same purpose?) or any unleaded
fuel protection.   What are the ways to protect an engine against unleaded
fuel heating?

Cheers,
