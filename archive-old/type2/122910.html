Subject: hesitation upon acceleration

I got looking at the linkage for the accelerator when I got home from work.
Thought.. before I get all technical and complicated.. do the simple stuff.

Turns out.. The accel pedal came loose from the rod underneath and was
floating a bit rather than in the hole (pedal). The floating was messing 
around
with the top end .. the speed and power for getting it up ;)

I do think I will buy a manual off of ebay.
I am really starting to enjoy the little things more :)
