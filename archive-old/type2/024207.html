Hello List   I have posted this before but it never showed. The first thing 
in considering the shape of the engine is to remove the flywheel and the 3 
shims. Reinstall the flywheel without the shims and torque down. Set the 
motor on TDC and attach a dial indicator. Now check the end play. This is 
what is called the dead endplay. A new motor will be about .030, above .050 
and it's time to rebuild and linebore the case and cut the thrust.   Mark
