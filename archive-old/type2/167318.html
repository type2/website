&gt;I want to pul;l my flywheel and change the rear main while I have the engine out.

&gt;  Is a flywheel lock a common item that maybe the flaps would carry or is it a specialty item that will have to be ordered.

Any vw parts store with a tool section should have one. This one is the most common:

It's a copy of the original tool that's been modified to fit both styles (one side 6V, one side 12V).

It's inexpensive ($7) but I find it doesn't work that great by itself as seen by the box wrench I used to keep it in place:

Sold by EMPI/Bugpack/etc:
