Volks,

Hi!  Steve, the &quot;UNIX Idiot&quot; here :-)  All the mail from Saturday and
Sunday got sidetracked into a file, because some &quot;UNIX Idiot&quot; messed up
:-( It did get saved to a file, however, and I am going to forward it to
the list tonight, as individual messages (which the list will compose into
digests). It will all look normal, except that there will be a lot of it.  
There are 90K worth of messages in that file, tho, so be prepared for a
bit of a reading session in the morning :-)  I can't believe I did that
(and didn't even realize that something was wrong), and I do apologize.

                           H Steven Dolan
