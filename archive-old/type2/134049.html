Subject: My former 68 hitop

ALL,

A lot of people asked me about the fate of my 1968 HiTop bus. I sold 
it (total sell out for now) in May to a nice fellow who lives about 
50 Km for my house. He was a really nice fellow that had had a bus 
for about 9 years before it died a few years ago. When I got back 
form BOTC I got a voice mail from him telling me to check out the 
members gallery at www.fullmoonbusclub_dot_com to see what the current 
state of the bus was. Check it out!

You may have to cut an paste the link above or just go to 
www.fullmoonbusclub_dot_com and select gallery. It is the hightop album 
on the first page.

Thanks
