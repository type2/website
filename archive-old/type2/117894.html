Subject: myth busters bus... shocking!

hey all, i am watching myth busters and they are doing an experiment on 
static electricity. they went to a junk yard to see what kind of charge they 
can get from car interior, well they happened to stumble on a good 
condition( except for all the crap piled on the pop-top roof) westy. they 
went inside and rubbed pvc pipe on the bed in the back. the bus was a good 
one, the interior was in great condition from what i could see. did anyone 
else catch that?
                             josh 1967 panel convert
                              &quot;she will soon be reborn&quot;  \X/
  anyone got a engine for a '67 bus that they are not using? i need one, 
even if it dont run. thanks.
