&gt; flame but I would think if a person anchored it real well, that it would

&gt; What do y'all think?

In your storage shed, I think that it would be a near ideal solution.  I
far prefer propane to kerosene, as kerosene has a tendency to stink.

In your bus, it would be an entirtely different story.  While I have seen
similar systems and their owners seemed happy enough (and still alive), I
would never put a heater of any type that involved combustion in an
enclosed space.  With proper venting, a strong anchor, yada...yada... 
You live till the first time someone plays with it and you don't notice. 
You drift gently off to sleep and never wake up.
