Subject: Re: [T2] How to make a 72 rear bumper fit a 71?

Kevin,

Don't panic. You're going to make it out of this one alive.

OK, the bumper is exactly the same as the '68-'71. The reason the mounts are 
outboard on the '72 is because of the wider Type 4 engine.

Now I could get you the exact dimension but, there is even a better 
approach. Because your brackets may have moved even slightly do to a bumper 
in the rear so to speak, it is best for you to simply measure yours and 
drill them out. But hold on it is not that simple. The holes should be 
square. Hey anyone seen a square drill bit around here? Ahhh. Me?, I drill 
them with a bit that is the same diameter as the length on one side of the 
square. Then take a small triangular file and head out into the corners. 
Presto a square hole. This is needed for the stock bolts to hold in place 
during tightening. No one wants a hex head sticking out of there painted 
bumper.

First problem solved. Now what about those holes for the early mounting. 
Simple I just use more original bolts either chrome or painted, what ever 
you use for the '72 mount. That's it, the only folks that will even think to 
notice is a true purist. If you are worried about that I should think that 
you would weld, drill and repaint or powder coat. Either way you would still 
be a hero to me.

Just another '72 bus quark worked out. OK on to the next, &quot; If I just cut 
through the top above the engine and put an access......yeah where's that 
torch....&quot; NOOOOOoooo!

&gt; Howdy,
&gt;
&gt; To make a long story short I was sold what was suppose to be a 68-71 rear 
&gt; bumper.
