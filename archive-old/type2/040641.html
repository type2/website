Subject: how do I test an air pressure relief valve ...

Volks, 
 Without wanting to sound like an Oscar winner, I would like to thank all those who answered my query last week regarding an air leak on the rebuilt 1800 engine in my 74 bus. The leak was caused by a broken rubber boot at the air pressure relief valve, the upright cylindrical thing that sits on top of the fan housing to the right of the air injector pump.The relief valve is one of the very few components not replaced or rebuilt when I did the engine and carbs 800 miles ago, and I'm thinking that there is no coincidence in the failure of the (new) rubber boot on this old component. Now my question is...
... How can I test the relief valve for effectiveness? If it is blocked or faulty, can it be repaired or is a &quot;new&quot; component the only way to go? There seems to be little information out there on this item, which I believe is only installed on the dual-carb models that need to be smogged.
 Also, I removed the belt that drives the air injector pump after my smog test as the thing made an awful racket, although I left the rest of the smog gear in situ, ie: the pipes to carry the fresh air to the cylinder heads, the pipes to and from the aforesaid relief valve, the EGR valve and box...should the smog gear be removed completely and all plumbing blocked off or has anyone managed to leave it in place and merely isolate the it? I like the idea of reducing the emissions on the van, but the smog gear seems to make her run rather weird.

All help appreciated,
