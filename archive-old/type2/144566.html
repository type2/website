Subject: broke down (nuts!)

Well, friends, my trip out west has come to a screeching halt. was headed toward the north rim of the grand Canyon, about 18 mi south of Jacob Lake when I lost power. Checked plugs, all solid in place, checked spark, nice blue spark, started checking fuel lines, pulled hose nearest to fuel pump, dry as a bone. I'm 99% sure my fuel pump is out. '74 bus, 1700cc, dual carbs, mechanical pump.
 
Had to be towed 50 miles to Fredonia, AZ, where I am awating parts. Haven't ordered them yet (thought I would just buy a new pump and install it). It's at a garage, so if I can get the pump overnighted from one of the usual suppliers, I should be in biz.
 
Previous responses to my temp questions were all very helpful, although conflicting. Bottom line is that the engine was running strong and sounding good up until this point.
 
I repeat: I feel this is a fuel issue, specifically the pump (mechanical). Any hints on ease of replacement, things to look out for or other theories as to the sudden loss of power? I'll be online sporadically (in a public library right now), but will check my mail tomorrow. Thanks!
