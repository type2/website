Subject: oil bath on FI air sensor

Thanks for helping me figure this motor out, guys!  From what I gather, it
is a 411 setup.  However, did the 411 use an oil bath with the FI airflow
sensor like this???  Any chance the oil residue could be bad for the sensor
if that is not original?

Thanks,
Wade
