Subject: Where you live? KUDOS!!! :-)

Hey!

I'm really enjoying reading the &quot;Where you live&quot; stuff. It seems that 
there aren't as many women as men and that there's NOBODY over here on 
the Eastern Sierra with us. But - I almost feel like the grandma of the 
group at 46!!! Lot's of young guys out there and not many of us Boomers!

:-)

P.S. Her Majesty is beached in her last snow storm of her life! Today 
she get's shoveled and started up and tomorrow she gets moved into her 
new garage!!! YES! Her clear coat thanks me. Plus - I've gotta get her 
inside away from all these crazy LAShuns! Jeeeez! When will they ever 
learn to drive? Again - it's a shame that $40K Range Rovers don't come 
with brains!!!
