What to do about waterproofing poptop canvas? It depends. Is anyone going 
to sleep in the upper bunk (74 and later) or cot (68-73)? If not, leave 
the canvas alone. Most of the time, it will be adequate to keep things 
dry in all but a driving rain. When things get worse, close the top. Be 
sure to open it up and let the canvas dry when the sun comes out. 
Waterproofing treatments generally shorten the life of the canvas, and it 
really isn't needed most of the time.

If someone must sleep up there when it is raining, it is far better to 
rig up some kind of fly rather than to apply waterproofing. Polyethlene 
tarp, if you can stand the noise. Or oiled/waxed/Thompson-watersealed 
canvas if you cannot. 

If the &quot;canvas&quot; is actually cotton canvas, it will swell and seal when 
wet. Has done, for hundreds of years. More likely, though, it's 
polyester. If it's polyster, what to do depends on how tight the weave 
is. Polyester does _not_ swell when wet, so an open weave stays open when 
wet. This is really the only time it makes sense to waterproof. Some 
folks on the list have used Thompson's water seal with success. Or check 
your Campmor catalog.

If the &quot;canvas&quot; is sunbrella, such as Dawn's (PLF) product, that should 
be tight enough to shed water without waterproofing.

So it depends. But best thing is to leave it alone.

P.S. Dave from CO, drop me another post. Lost your last one.
