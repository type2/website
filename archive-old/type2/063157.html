If the deposits are the ones I'm thinking of (they look like black shelac), I was told 
this was caused by oil baking onto the surface (called varnish by my mechanics 
instructors... it's a combination of oil, sulfur and carbon). It can be removed w/ 
carburater cleaner. Back in the &quot;good old days&quot;, when engines had breather tubes instead 
of PCV systems, it was common to scrape a cup of &quot;carbon&quot; off the top side of an engine 
head of an inline 6. I've seen it accumulate in the valve cover 1/8&quot; thick, and thicker 
on the head itself.

The pitting is odd. It does sound like the engine was left sitting w/ old oil... or 
somehow moisture got inside the engine.

It will be interesting to see how the engine turns out.
