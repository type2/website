Subject: Sh*t, bad day, help on windscreen frame rust.
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

Hi Volks,

Sorry for letting off steam. I jost got the windshield of my '77 crushed by
a carwash. The car had been stabled for nearly a year and I got it on the
road again 2 weeks ago. This is the car I did my first welding job on (see
my website, address below).

It started off as a really nice day, it was sunny and bright. I did some
really useful work in the morning. I need to do that once in a while to earn
my keep as a self employed IT consultant. Then I decided to do some odd jobs
on the car this afternoon. The car had been parked under some trees and had
gotten dirty. So I decided to run it thru a carwash to give it a quick clean
up and make it shine again. I am a regular at this gas station/carwash and
drove buses thru the same installation before (BUT NEVER AGAIN!). However,
today one of the horizontal brushes decided it wanted to crush my
windscreen. I was in the drivers seat ang got glass all over me. Apart from
some very minor cuts I was not injured. Took me a while to get all of the
glas out of my hair and clothes.

Now there's good and bad in this. The good news is that I will have a brand
new windscreen, clean and without any scratches, and the carwash will pay
for it. The bad news is that (as is to be expected) there was some rust
under the seal. The glass and seal have been ordered by my friendly VW
dealer. That could take a couple of days, not really a problem. Before it
get's fitted I want to take care of the rust. It's not too bad. Just three
spots (left, middle and right side) of the lower frame. I think one needs
welding, there's hardly any metal left.. The other two can be preserved.
Does anyone have any recommendations?
