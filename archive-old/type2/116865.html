Subject: Re: [T2] thump, pop, thug, pop down the road....

&gt;when i decelerate coming to a stop or if im simply
&gt;idling my bus pops, sounds d-tuned or something,

My bus too pops and especially when i rev high and let off the gas, i'm 
convinced it's because my mufffler has a huge hole in it. You might have an 
exaust leak and the bus is backfiring.

I shudder to think that my pop might actually be a knock, but god i hope 
not, i think it's a pop. Hard to tell.
