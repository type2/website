 I don't think this is correct. I am not certain of the changeover year, but
on later models the fan is switched on when the heat lever is fully &quot;on&quot;,
all the way at the bottom. On these models there is a wire and contact on
the frame that carries the heater and fresh air controls, and the contact is
grounded by the heater lever, tripping the relay which starts the fan.

Early and late works when the key is on and the heater lever is at the bottom.
But late will work all the time, as stated above..
Early, the engine has to be running to have a signal to the relay. 
Late ones did away with the engine running signal.
