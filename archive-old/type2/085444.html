Subject: Re: [T2] Pop top

Hi Kevin,

Congratulations, and welcome to the Westfakia Club!

You can convert your bus to use a 74-79 roof, but it will take a LOT of
effort. Converting my transporter from 7-passeger to westfakia took over 100
man-hours of labour to install a 74 pop-top and canvas,  because major
bodywork is needed to do it right.

The best way to install a bed upstairs in your type of Westfakia is what I
am now referring to as the &quot;Benthin Bed&quot;, named after a master Westfalia
Modifier by the name of Mike Benthin. (He didn't actually invent this bed,
but since he was the first to tell me about it, he is getting the credit.)
This is a flat plywood bed that is hinged at the front of the bus. When
you're not using the bed it can be lifted up to keep the roof area clear,
and when it's needed it can be dropped down and provides a more comfortable
accomodation than the folding cot ever could. These were optional equipment
on European Westys but not offered in North America.

Mike sent me pictures of the &quot;Benthin bed&quot;, I'll get them on my Westfakia
website tonight. Adam Narraway is building a one for his 68 Westy and
pictures of his setup will go online there as soon as possible.


Happy trails,

Greg Potts

&gt; List,
&gt; I have a 79 with a poptop installed by PO. The poptop is hinged in the
&gt; front and the luggage storage piece(w/the slats) is in the rear of the
&gt; bus. This doesn't seem to match any of the 79 poptops. I have seen. I
&gt; need to replace both the seal and the canvas so I need to know what I
&gt; have here??
&gt; I would also love to know if I could find the correct top as this one
&gt; has no provisions for an upper bed . Thanks all
