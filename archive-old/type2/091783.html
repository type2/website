Subject: Re: [T2] Oil cooler hose size reduction

[...]
my last one was just the opposite 3/8 coming out of the sandwich and 
half on the cooler.  I stepped up to the 1/2 size because it was more 
convenient with adapters and hose that i had on hand.  If you look at 
the size of the hole inside the sandwich you will see that 3/8 is 
already bigger anyway if you want to go 3/8 instead.
the hole in the sandwich is about 5/16

&gt; I am installing an oil cooler, per Ron VanNess article, in order to drop

&gt; have the adapter to reduce the hose diameter but I am wondering what
&gt; this reduction in size will have on my lubrication system. I am not an
