Subject: Re: [T2] High beam stuck on

Check the the connections in the connector block between the switch and wiring loom have not come loose

&gt; put the high beams on and now they will not go out.  The switch on the column
&gt; doesn't seem to respond.  Where do I start to fix this, I would hate to blind
&gt; an oncoming vehicle.
