    Hi All.

 Well the Contraption took my family and I on a wonderful trip the last 2
weeks.
Traveled from Strathroy Ontario to the east coast of Canada. The farthest
point being Lunenberg Nova Scotia. We camped every night at various
campgrounds prefering the National and Provincial Parks to the private ones.
The bus worked well although I'm glad I brought all my tools. I reset the
timming after really bogging down on some of the long hills. Also did a
valve adjust at about 1500 miles in. We traveled a total of 3072 miles
burning 140.6 Imperial gallons of gas at a cost of 473.86$ Can.
The milage was good at 21.85 mpg. Not bad considering the 1700 cc engine
with fully loaded bus and 4 people!  When we pulled into the photo shop
about 2 miles from home to drop off our films upon restarting...it wouldn't!
I couldn't believe it.
Found the points had closed up. Reset and drove home.
Today the bus got a good cleaning and oil,filter,screen, and point
resetting. Running smooth again.

Glad to be home again.
