Subject: 71 steering box

I'm in the process of rebuilding my steering box for my 71 bus. As you may
know, it a worm ang peg steering box made for 68-72 busses. It has been
dissassembled, cleaned, inspected, reassembled and I made a tentative of
ajusting it. Ajustment of the peg bearing is easily done following the
Bentley as it is for the worm gear bearing with the shims. But ajustment of
the screw is impossible du to a possible play between the peg and the worm
gears. At a certain point, there is no play. But in an other position the
play is terrible. My goal is to have the worm gear remachined to clear all
these differeces. The type2.archives_dot_com are not clear on that if the worm
can be remachined of if anyone has ever had it done. I know that this worm
gear is heat treated but a light polishing should not destroy the hardness
of this steel. Who has experience with this rebuilt?
