Dear friends:

I unsubscribed from the list but remained in the digest mode.  I  have a
friend going to Miami this weekend an I would really appreciate if
anyone can advise if there is a VW supplier in the Miami area.  I
specially need rubber and interior parts as the engine compartment
rubber seal.     Hope anyone can help !!.
