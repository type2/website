Subject: Re: [T2] coil primary resistance-more is better?

At 07:26 PM 05/14/2003, you wrote:

&gt;I was installing a Compu-fire when i read that a ballast resistor must be 
&gt;used if the primary resistance is between .5 and .75 ohms.  So i checked 
&gt;my coil, it read 2.9;  I checked another one, 2.0; next was a blue coil, 
&gt;3.4 and finally another blue coil, 3.4 ohms.
&gt;
&gt;So is more resistance better?

Either do what Compu-Fire says, or contact them to confirm or explain. If 
it clearly states &quot;must be used&quot;, it seems quite clear to me what 
Compu-Fire advises. But read the whole literature that came with the 
device. May be better all around to buy the Compu-Fire coil designed to 
work with the Compu-Fire trigger, and even the Compu-Fire CDI. Then you 
will have a system designed to work in harmony, just like the Bosch system 
you removed. Mixing ignition parts from various manufacturers can open 
doors to strange happenings. But this is a case where you need to know for 
sure as you may find a clause somewhere that says, &quot;warranty void if 
installed incorrectly&quot;.
