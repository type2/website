Subject: Propane stove For Non-campers...

Was just down at the local Wally world, and they have an item that I may just have
to buy...

    I believe it was a Coleman brand stove with one burner and a 12&quot;x14&quot; grill.
Looked reasonably portable, more so than the giant 3 burner unit right next to
it...

Price was a bit steep at $96, but not totally unreasonable....  Would be just the
ticket for grilling some chicken and doing up some Corn-on-the-cob for two people
without lugging a big gas grill around...

    Told Santa that I wouldn't mind seeing one under the tree in a couple
weeks...  &lt;&lt;G&gt;&gt;
