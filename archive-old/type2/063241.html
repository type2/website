&gt; Hi,
&gt;
&gt; I have for sale a 1972 (paperwork says 1971) VW camper.  It runs well
&gt; and has a new muffler.  I just drove it 10,000 miles from Texas and
&gt; it performed flawlessly, apart from having to replace the muffler.
&gt; I've been living comfortably in it for the last few months and I
&gt; need to sell it to buy a plane ticket.
