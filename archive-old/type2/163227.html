Subject: Re: [T2] winter storage for my 65 beetle ?

hello Jim  If you can't afford the bag get the best all weather car  cover 
you can. Drain all the gas out of the car . If the tires are really  good get an 
old set to store and paint the car on. I have kept 2 bugs like thois  for 
years and don't have any problems.  I do go out and start mine every  month and 
move them some just to keep things working, If you can afford such get  a 
tempory car port, These can be had here for about $600 and with a  car cover this 
works well.    Later  Mark  Dearing
