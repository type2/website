Subject: RE: [T2] RE: Westy Green Plaid

&gt; Here's my standard answer to the &quot;where can I get plaid??&quot; email:
&gt;
&gt; Unfortunely, nobody that I know of reproduces the plaid fabric that
&gt; was installed in westfalia campers. ...
&gt; The best place to get the fabric is from old westy campers that are
&gt; being parted out. I got some brown plaid for my 79 camper on
&gt; http://www.ebay_dot_com . .. Another place is from local junkyards.
&gt; The best fabric comes from the top bunk.


To this I'll add two more options:

1)  We have a small quantity remaining of N.O.S. '76-77 orange/green/yellow
plaid (the one right above the green plaid on your page,
http://john-perry_dot_com/vw/plaid.html ). This is brand new and still on the
roll.  I sell it for $99 per section, a section being enough plaid to redo
either one pair of front seats or one sofabed (seat back and bottom,
excluding the rear mattress).  Email me if interested, or call the 215
number and ask for Dan or Andy, as it is not on our website or in our
catalog.  This plaid has the same shades of orange, yellow, and green as the
green plaid does, only in a different combination (heavier on the
orange/yellow).  But it is designed to match the same green carpet and green
door panels as the green plaid did, as Westies that had this
orange/green/yellow plaid had the same green panels and carpet as the green
Westies did.  So while it is not the same as the green plaid, it does look
good in busses that originally had the green plaid as it picks up the same
colors.

2)  You already have some extra plaid in your bus that you can use for
reupholstery if you so desire. The underside of your cushions (upper and
lower bed) are upholstered in plaid, even though they face the bottom and
are never seen. In fact, the plaid there is probably in great shape, as it
has never been sat on or used.  In a pinch, you can cut out the underside
sections of fabric, sew a different fabric in its place, and use that plaid
to reupholster your front seats.  Unless someone looks under your mattresses
(which is particularly difficult on the upper bunk) they'll never even know
you did this.
