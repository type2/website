Subject: Re: [T2] Top swap?

Hi Jasan,

It can be done.  I myself asked this very question to the list back in 
1998.

At that time I had a fairly rusty 73 westy with a single-bed pop-top 
and 3 kids, which simply does not compute to easy camping. I didn't get 
much of a response to my query so I put the idea aside because the bus 
did not merit a major overhaul to install the wider roof.

Fast forward to spring 2000. A list-member offers up a 79 Kombi free to 
a good home in NH. No engine, no tranny, no interior. I don't need 
those parts because the 73 has them. I dragged the 79 Kombi home (700 
miles) on April 1st 2000, and began the westification project. See 
http:/www.pottsfamily_dot_ca/westfakia for more info.

Swapping a late-bay poptop onto a non-poptop or early bay poptop is 
about 50-100 hours work. This includes the prepwork to repaint the bus, 
and lots of time to learn how to weld. A proficient welder or autobody 
professional could probably cut that time in half. Cutting corners 
would also take a lot less time, for my next project I would consider 
not welding and using auto-body adhesives instead.

Happy trails,

&gt;&gt; I'm waiting on a guy in Idaho to send me pictures of the '71 he has
&gt;&gt; for sale and am thinking of getting it.  It sounds like its exactly
&gt;&gt; what I want.  My only question is regarding the top.  The '71 has the
&gt;&gt; smaller cot up top, right?  Any idea if the bigger bed/top can be
&gt;&gt; swapped onto the '71?
