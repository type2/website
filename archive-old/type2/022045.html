On occasions I have read references to cow magnets and their use in engine 
oil systems. Are these serious metal particle removal schemes or simply shade 
tree stunts?   Is there merit to their use on systems having remote spin on 
filters? Used in conjunction with the filter or only in the absence of a 
filter? Placed in the crankcase? How? Myth or creative solution? What's the 
story? Ray Riches, Spokane Wa, 68 Kombiwagen, 69 Transporter
