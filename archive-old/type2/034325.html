never done it, but then I use the slider almost 100% of the time.  but the
other cars have done a number to my paint job.

&gt; What can I do about this????  Any suggestions on how to pad the bottom of
&gt; the door?

there is a clear plastic stick on vinyl that might work, saw it at Home
Depot, used for protecting door edges.  (might work, never tried it)
