Jack:
I just bought an old Allen Distributor tester at an auto meet and
overhauled it which consisted mostly of cleaning years of gunge off and
replacing the vacuum hoses. It works great.
It has all testing functions, dwell setting, centrifugal advance
testing/adjusting and vacuum advance/retard testing. It has a strobe
system that checks cam wear/bearing wear etc.
I would be happy to test/adjust your distributor (for a nominal fee to
keep the freeloaders away), say $10 BUT you must provide me with
complete specs. There are only about a dozen different distributors on
VW`s. The above applies to point types only.
I am located in Gulf Breeze, FL, near Pensacola. E-Mail me if you are
interested and I will provide my address.
Regards, John
