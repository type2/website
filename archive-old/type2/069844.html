Haven't actually seen the car myself, but its s'posed to be a _roach_

The infamous Mark Merz is pimping this one, and from personal experience,
he's a bit of a hammerhead, way high on prices.  Like the '59-'67
rear bumper, missing an overrider, a few dings, $250.  Gimme a break.

&quot;All glass up front original?&quot;  THat means its probably missing the
ambulance glass on the sides, which was frosted 3/4 of the way up.

&quot;Rust free original dog legs?&quot;  Sounds like &quot;Bus for sale.  Good tires&quot;

&gt;From my experience and talking to others, it sounds like this would be
a $2500 bus.

Also, ambulance stuff is expensive and hard to come by.  I wonder if it
has all the ambulance bits: jump seat, removable chair, gurney rails,
gurney, spotlight, beacon, siren, etc...
