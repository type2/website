Subject: Re: [T2] HUD definition of a rec. vehicle

One needs to have a satellite account already with possession of 
receiver(s) containing their own approved cards.  The company will 
charge for an extra receiver if one applies for a RV option (usually 
around $5 a mo).  They have no clue where that receiver acutually is if 
it is not hooked to a phone line, so one can take a receiver on the road 
along with a portable dish to see everything but your local feeds or 
national networks (usually suppled locally).

  Hi Mike.  OK, explain this free stuff to  someone who hasn't ever used 
a satellite dish.  Do you mean  absolutely free or free once you pay 
somebody some basic fee?  I  didn't know you could tap into any 
satellite networks for free anymore  like you once could with the big 
dishes.  If so, I may have to  pick up one of those babies.  Cheers...KR
