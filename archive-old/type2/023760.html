Hi,

&gt; I'm using Michlin 185-R 14&quot; Tires, sidewall also says 91T M7S 
&gt; which means
&gt; nothing to me. Max load 1356 LBS Per tire.

 It means that they are underspec. for your bus: the load rating
is not high enough and they are likely to fail prematurely. 

&gt; They give me 70 MPH at 2,900 RPM, 80 MPH at 3,100 RPM and the 
&gt; speedo is
&gt; right on as far as accuracy goes.

 Yes, that would make sense, as 185R14 is the correct size.

&gt; I've been getting them from Discount Trire Co. and they last 
&gt; about 35,000
&gt; Miles before they begin to separate. It's easy to tell when separation
&gt; starts, you start hearing the tires, they get louder. At this 
&gt; point I go
&gt; in for a free rotation and balance and the employee that's doing the
&gt; rotation reports the failing tire and I get a new set or at least two.
&gt; The fact that I camp in some very rough terrain and drive very rocky
&gt; roads to get there is what causes the separation to occur prematurely.

 You appear to be happy with this. Personally it would make 
me uncomfortable, as I would constantly worry about a failure
occurring without warning. I have never had a tyre seperate
in the way you describe, and I'd like to keep it that way!

&gt; Discount tire warrantys a set for me every year for about 
&gt; $40.00 for all
&gt; four, I only purchased the one set about seven years ago. I 
&gt; don't believe
&gt; that I want to go to a heavier tire (more plys). They normally have to
&gt; order the tires because they aren't a popular item.

 Fair enough. Obviously you are entitled to do as you wish. I'm
glad I don't drive in your area, though!

 In the UK your insurance would be void if you were to drive
on these tyres (it's like driving a Porsche on T (110mph)
rated tyres, they would inspect the vehicle and refuse to
pay the claim because the tyres don't meet the manufacturers
specification for the car). This may not apply in the USA,
but if I were you I would check.

&gt; I've found the right size for me and the warranty has always 
&gt; provided me
&gt; with new tires at least once every 18 months. So I'm a happy camper.

 Without wishing to be rude or objectionable (ie I don't intend
to cause offense) I would say that this is a case of &quot;ignorance
is bliss&quot;. I am not suggesting that you are foolish or
stupid, but using ignorance in its true sense- as you have already
stated that you don't understand what the load rating on the 
sidewall means.

Cheers,
	  W.
