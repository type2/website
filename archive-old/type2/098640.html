Subject: Re: [T2] rear side marker

thanks everyone! what was confusing about the lens was that WCM was
calling it a &quot;reflector&quot; not a lens, so i thought it was a separate unit
to be used instead of the light housing. after brousing bus depot, i came
to this same conclusion. also, WCM listed the &quot;bulb holder&quot; as starting
in 71, not 70, so i was a little confused about that.

as far as the tabs that hold it to the body... thanks for the tips,
guys... now that i know this, i can save that one instead of replacing
it.

thanks again everyone!

70 westy (with a REALLY big wish list now)

&gt; Hi Chris,
&gt; 
&gt; You need both pieces. One is the bulb holder and the other the red lens
that
&gt; goes over it...
&gt; The bulb holder is correct for all years (1970-79). There are two 
variations
&gt; on the lens.
