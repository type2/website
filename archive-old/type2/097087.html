Subject: RE: High beam stuck on

Sounds like the high/low beam switch in the turn signal switch assembly is
not making contact when you pull the lever back.  Test by momentarily
shorting wire &quot;S&quot; to ground or 12V positive (I'm not sure which it is and
can't tell from the wiring diagram - somebody help me here).

If doing so makes the high/low beam change, then you'll need to remove the
switch from the steering column and find out why it is not making contact.
May be as simple as cleaning the contacts, or could be worn out contacts.
If it's the latter, it may be repairable by building up the contacts with
solder, although the longevity of such a repair may not be very good.
That's what I'd be trying first though, 'cause new switches are scarce and
expensive.

If the problem is not the switch, then it is almost certainly the dimmer
relay, which you are probably best off replacing.

I took the old westy for a spin today after about month of little projects
and
put the high beams on and now they will not go out.  The switch on the
column
doesn't seem to respond.  Where do I start to fix this, I would hate to
blind
an oncoming vehicle.
