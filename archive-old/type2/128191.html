Subject: Re: [T2]Spark Plug PiCs after 360 miles (Advice)

I couldn't get any of the pictures to pull up, but if
one of the chokes is not working right that will
effect the richness of the engine, I didn't like the
way the linkage worked on those carbs anyway. Any
adjustment that you do will effect the balance of the
carbs. Phil
