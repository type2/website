I recently bought an '81 Westy, which I've enjoyed very much.  Took a trip
from Northern Virginia to the New River Gorge area of West Virginia (where
you can legally BASE jump on the 3rd Saturday in October every year from the
New River Gorge Bridge, 850 feet above the water.  A fun trip to watch the
festivities during the colorful fall season).  I discovered an oil leak
which even spattered some oil on the rear hatch.  The bus was going through
a pint of oil every 100 miles.  In looking for answers, found out possible
sources were pushrod tube oil seals, valve cover gaskets, oil pressure
sensor, oil cooler seals, and main oil seals.  Feeling a bit intimidated, I
took the bus to Paul's Auto in Annandale, VA, VW specialists.  To my relief,
the leak apparently was caused by a stopped up breather system.  Relieving
the internal engine pressures has evidently cured the leak.

The mechanic thinks I shouldn't have any more problems.  So, if you have an
oil leak, the fix may be easier than you think.
