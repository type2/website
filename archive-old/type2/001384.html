Faced just last week with the same problem on my '81 I fabricated a nice
replacement from about 1/8&quot; aluminum.  Doesn't look perfect but with a
reflective quality I'm betting heat under the seal, and more importantly
directly below the cooling fan inlet, will be greatly reduced.  I had the
aluminum but can't imagine a nice chunk to do it would cost more than
$5-$10.
