Subject: Re: Westfalia insurance

Todd,
Because everyone is touting their favorite insurance co., here's mine:
State Farm. I've had liability only insurance with them on our Westfalia 
since 1977 at an extremely economical rate. Because it is not a daily 
driver, but rather a &quot;housecamper&quot; classification, understood to be driven 
only for recreation, I pay half-the normal rate (6-month premium covers me 
for a year), i.e. a little less than  $ 100. Because its garaged I don't 
carry comprehensive, and I'm careful enough to not feel the need to buy 
collision.
Roland - 75 Westy
