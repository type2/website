Subject: Saved one today

Hi Volks!

Another one saved!  This one is a '75 panel van, neptune
blue, tastefully camperized, that we (a pal and I) barely
saved from its fate to be sold for parting out.  It'll
go into my pal's caring hands soon, as finances permit,
to join forces with his crewcab and deluxe bus, all of
similar vintage.  Me, I have enough panel vans as is :-)

Just wanted to share.  Save those commercial Transporters,
they're rare enough as is.  Part out the Kombis and
Westies instead ;-)  (kidding!)

Airhowlingly yours,
   Erik.
