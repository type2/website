Subject: Now I'm _Talking!_

Just got done with the new radio installation in my bus.  My wife gave me
a very fancy Icom 706 Mk II G ham radio for father's day, and I finally
got around to installing it in the '71 bus.  This installation could be
called an &quot;extreme&quot; job, since the radio works on everything from 440MHz
all the way down to 1.6Mhz.

the UHF and VHF frequencies are no problem, since the wavelength is larger
than the car and the roof rack acts as a good ground plane.  I ran into
big problems trying to get the antennas (Hustler Super resonators on 40
and 80 meter bands) to match at the lower frequencies, particularly at
3.8MHz.  A wire antenna cut for 3.8MHz is over 100 feet long, so getting a
resonant antenna on a vehicle is a bit of a challenge of coil-winding!

I couldn't get the the SWR of the antenna (a measure of efficiency) to be
less than a very marginal 2:1.  I propped up on side of the rack so that I
could reach under it to tighten the connections and was pleasantly
surprised to find that the antenna matched perfectly!  Seems that the
luggage rack was acting as a capacitor with the roof of the bus!  I
connected two 8-guage ground wires from the body to the rack and all was
well.

Power was also a concern, as the radio puts out 100W and draws about 20A
while doing so.  The battery is a long way from the radio where it sits on
the parcel shelf below the dash.  I ran 8-guage wire from the starter
terminal under the bus and drilled a hole beneath the passenger seat
pedistal to get the wire into the bus.  This connects to the radio.  I
used the body of the bus as the ground return which is normally a no-no,
but the bus has such a unit-body that everything is grounded!  I measured
about 0.5V of voltage drop while transmitting at full power.

The above took about two days of twiddling and fiddling.

The acid test occured this morning.  I fired up the radio and had a
conversation on 3.872MHz with my Dad in Carson City NV.  That's about 400
miles away.  I also talked on 7.288MHz to a gentleman in Monterey (300
miles) and another in Corona (100 miles or so).

As you can see, this is definitely _not_ a CB radio! :)

George Lyle, happily hamming in his bus!
