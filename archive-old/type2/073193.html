&gt;     Probably, 'cept I know Ken likes Macs, so there's an off chance
&gt;we're running on MacOS

BSD. David Raistrick is the man who is willing to put his head in the
lion's mouth so he got to pick the lion. perl is not a problem.

&gt;Also, that doesn't eliminate the bandwidth issue-since perl is
&gt;relatively demanding we may not have the available resources on our poor
&gt;overworked server...  ;-)

Actually the server is extremely powerful, it merely requires a bit of
stropping. 8)  We should take this off-list, and I've already talked to
Jaime about his very worthwhile idea, but I did want to state this publicly
as a standing offer:

Bandwidth: We can't carry sound files or video but I'm sure any
text/graphic article is fine.

Disk space: We have eight gigs, virtually unlimited disk space.

Horsepower: It's huge, a 300 or a 350 (don't remember) donated by Brother
Denmeister from Canada and something around 64 megs of memory--we have a
hundred times more hardware than we can exploit.

So: We have the capacity for any worthwhile aircooled bus project you can
think of IF you are willing to carry the ball yourself. &quot;Worthwhile&quot; here
means rich information content, we're not interested in carrying &quot;look at
me!&quot; pages. But if you have an idea that can further the state of bus
knowledge on the net we'd love to hear it, we have lots of room.
