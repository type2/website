Subject: Re: [T2] bilge pump blowers
X-Diagnostic: MESSAGE REQUIRES APPROVAL

I am going to plumb off the heater tube through a hole into
the cavity under the passenger seat (front) and install the
blower fan there. I already played with the idea by coming
off an exsisting port on the distribution box under the bus
and putting a fan in line with that tube.... lotsa heat to
be had and that is with the next size down blower.
Hopefully I will get time to do this over X-mas vacation.

&gt; 
&gt; Someone from the list a while back put the challenge out
&gt; - why not just add
&gt; another stock VW fan next to the original?  Plumb some
&gt; dryer hose duct or
&gt; same stock ducting with slight mods to splice the mated
&gt; pieces together,
&gt; then wire it into the existing bundle.
&gt;
