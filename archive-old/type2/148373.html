&gt;I seem to recall someone making the point that you want to have 30 degrees
&gt;total advance under maximum load conditions, but that the
&gt;acceptable advance might be greater at partial throttle conditions.

Partial throttle mixtures take longer to ignite so they require more advance.

&gt;I think that this was touted as an advantage of the SVDA distributors.It
&gt;allows a greater advance for greater fuel economy at partial throttle, the
&gt;retards a bit at WOT conditions to give the needed 30 degrees advance.

The amount of vacuum advance is indirectly governed by the throttle position. The rule of thumb is zero at idle, some at partial throttle and almost none again at WOT.

The SVDA advantages are:

- better fuel economy
- better acceleration
- cooler heads

&gt;This is all theory until I actually put a vacuum guage on the line.

That's it.

&gt;It would seem to me that if the SVDA is holding 30 degrees under load, it
&gt;would probably advance more than 30 degrees when you rev the engine to
&gt;check the timing with no load on the engine.  If this is the case, then
&gt;the engine will actually have less than 30 degrees under real full-load
&gt;conditions.

Right. You can't dial in these distributors using the mechanical only max advance technique.

&gt;Does anyone actually know the correct procedure.  I'm not ready to buy a
&gt;chassis dyno to adjust my timing!  :)

The stock settings are best...

1. disconnect the vacuum can and test the witness the max advance w/ timing light and compare to Bentley.
2. test your vacuum can separetely with a vacuum pump w/ gauge and compare to Bentley
