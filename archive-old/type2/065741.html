&gt;Well folks: this is the moment I thought would never happen.

&gt;After only 20,000 miles the GEX 2.0 litre rebuild has begun to pack it in.

Argh.  Lot of bad news on the list these days... first Eddie Hintz and the
border, and now this!  Sorry to hear it.

&gt;Funny thing,  acceleration seems fine -read normal; cruising speed is 75+
&gt;and the cruising around town is per usual. Gas consumption has increased
&gt;considerably and idle is almost impossible to set properly.

When I bought my Capri the valves were so tight that there was almost no
compression in three cylinders.  I still thought it had a lot of power.

&gt;Option 3 it is and therefore I am looking for some basic advice from all
&gt;of you:
&gt;
&gt;Should I go with a left side head replacement only?

Definately not.  If one head is having problems, I would bet the other
isn't far behind.  Especially knowing GEX like I do.

&gt;Engine replacement?
&gt;
&gt;Rebuild?

I think you will probably be alright with replacement cylinder heads.  It's
a lot harder to mess up the bottom end of the motor, IMO.

&gt;At the minumum it will probably be around 900.00 CDN for this job (assuming
&gt;a cylinder head  at 400.00 and 9-10 hours labour).

&gt;In retrospect the 1000.00 not spent on buying  a VW factory rebuild at
&gt;installation two years ago  was clearly a false savings.

I've heard some bad things about VW of Canada's rebuilt engines.  When I
rebuilt my 2-liter it had generic, unmarked pistons in it which were
oversized.  I was told that VW of Canada often used such oddball parts in
their rebuilds.  Maybe it's no big deal, but I couldn't find new rings for
those pistons ANYWHERE!  Had to buy new stock-sized ones.

&gt;I am going to go after GEX to help cover some of the expenses here. I am
&gt;thinking poor quality workmanship is likely.

Likely?  Oh boy, I'd better not respond to that...

&gt;It is possible that the valves
&gt;are not seating properly due to  the seats having worked their way out but
&gt;at 20k?

Don't think there is any way to know until you have it apart, but if I were
you I would order a pair of heads from Mark Stephens and have them put on.
Then you will likely have a reliable engine again.  Again, sorry to hear
about this...
