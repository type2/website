Subject: $1000 Vanagon Westy in Va.

This will probably get me moderated but someone in the area might be 
looking to add a later model to their stable. From the Vanagon list

         Yep, Price drop already. Below is my original message I first
sent Thursday. Though I have had several inquiries they have all
expressed some nervousness about what might be wrong with the van.
Because of this and in the interest of a quick sale I am cutting my
asking price in half. It is now just $1000 cash.

83.5 Westy for Sale: Norfolk, Va.

FS: 83.5 Westy: Norfolk, Va

         This is an 83.5 Westy WaterBoxer with 75K original miles. The
paint is chalky and there is some minor seam rust but the body is
otherwise sound. The interior is solid and everything works but the
vinyl &quot;wallpaper&quot; is off in numerous places. Mechanically, it starts
great and runs fine when cold but stumbles and stalls when it warms up.
I believe it is only a minor problem. Folks from the list have told me
that it is likely the O2 Sonsor or some other emmision control related
problem because these things are essentially off when the engine is cold
(and running fine) but turn on and kick in when the engine is warm (and
stumbling).  In spite of the potential simplicity of the fix it has been
sitting in my driveway for some months unrepaired because of a stroke I
had a while ago that hit me pretty hard in the short term memory and
cognition department. The effect of this is kind of like Alzheimer's.
Over the last few months I have I have been starting it twice a week or
so to keep the lifters filled. Each time I do I tell myself I will track
down and fix the trouble &quot;soon&quot; but the truth is I am no longer capable
of doing much of anything on the old girl anymore. I have been in denial
for months but the time has come to find her a new family.

         I live in the Norfolk/Virginia Beach, Virginia area. I am no
longer employed so the old girl is available for inspection pretty much
anytime. Interested parties please email or call me.

         As for price, I am asking $2000. I figure a very low mileage
83.5 Westy in excellent shape is worth a minimum of $4000. My Westy is
somewhat short of excellent but I figure about $1000-$1500 maximum will
bring her into excellent shape. The $2000 for clear title to the Westy
leaves you a $500 buffer. Included in the sale are both a Bentley and a
Haynes plus a POR-15 kit I bought for the minor seam rust. If the
trouble is as minor as I think it is you may be able to fix it quickly
and drive it away to her new home.
