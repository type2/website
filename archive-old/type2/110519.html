Subject: Re: [T2] Master cylinder for clutch

&gt; Newbie here again - if it isn't one thing, it is another.  The brakes are ok
&gt; now, but I can't seem to find the master cylinder for the clutch on a '68 -
&gt; as it needs fluid.  The stick slips into gear nicely when the engine is off,
&gt; but will not move when the engine is on - this happens with my Ranger at
&gt; times, and I just add dot 3 fluid to the slave cylinder.  Can't find that
&gt; either on the '68.

again
repeat after me.
no hydraulic clutch in a 68 bus.
no slave cylinder
no master cylinder
no fluid

adjust clutch cable eith the wing nut at the end of the clutch cable on
the drivers side of the tracnsaxle bell housing.
