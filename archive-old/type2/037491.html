Subject: P-Brake Frustration

Hello All,
      As the subject line says, I'm about to the end of my rope with trying 
to adjust my parking brake. Went at it this morning, got both rear wheels off 
the ground, loosened up both cables, and removed the 2-3 oversized nuts a PO 
had put on the cable ends as &quot;spacers,&quot; why I don't know. Tightened up both 
cables, keeping the equalizer bar even, 'til I felt a slight drag on the 
wheels (per Bentley). Now, when I set the brake, the bus will not roll 
backwards, but rolls forward like the brake isn't on at all. I figure the 
shoes must be off in adjustment, started to play around with adjusting them, 
but still can't seem to get it quite right. Any suggestions? BTW, rear shoes 
are in good shape, replaced about 1K miles ago. TIA,  Jeff S.
