I have got to let this one go. Cash flow situation is becoming a
problem. Would 	like to get $2500, but I will deal. 

        I bought this in April 93, drove until October 96, off the
road
        till January 98, California tags good till Sept 99


	The good stuff

        &lt;6000 miles on the long block
        New TO bering (clutch excellent shape)
        new dual vacuum unit on distributor (all smog gear though not
needed in CA)
        new front pads and hoses on the disk brakes
        1 year old shocks all around 
        New front seat covers TMI
        all wood refinished (looks great)
        Firestone truck tires, good tread
        Alum. valve covers
        deep oil sump (works well for me)
        new curtains all around including front windshield (beige)
        carpeted
        AM/FM Cassette with CD input 80 watts 4 channel output
        VDO oil temp gauge (have VDO CHT gauge but not installed)
        Ripstop Nylon poptop tent w/ huge zippered and screened window
towards back
        child cot for front area
	Power cord for side AC connector
	Lover windows are fine

        Not included
        Refig (PO tossed it)
        Side closet (same as above)

	NEEDS
	Rear bumper (have old, slightly twecked, salvagable)
	Windshield has damage upper corner passenger side (no leak or vision
obstruction
	

        I am sure there is other stuff I have to think about to add to
this
        list.

	This is a daily driven Bus.
