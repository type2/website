Subject: RE: 76 westy No start after long trips???

using a
&gt; Ford style solenoid to
&gt; route the starter wire directly from the battery,
&gt; using the ignition switch
&gt; as a trigger for the starter rather than actually
&gt; feeding the main starter
&gt; wire through it

I would recommend using the Bosch from bus depot.  my
jeep uses a ford ignition switch for starting purposes
and it is a royal PIA.  every old jeep ive owned i
think ive always replaced them at least 2X because
they go bad and dont function right.  IMHO they are
junk!   plus i agree it would be overkill, i have a
simple small relay on my bus, and it has worked just
fine:)
