Subject: adjusting stove flame

&gt;The Seppelfricke model 113.1 stove in our newly-acquired 84 Westie seems
&gt;to want a burner adjusted. One burner operates well: a nice blue flame,
&gt;?not too large. The other puts out a lot more flame and it is not just
&gt;blue, but has yellow tips -- how do you adjust these things?
&gt;

It can be very simple or it can be very complicated to adjust the flame.

depends on if you have to adjust both the LP gas volume and the air additive.

yellow tips means too much gas and not enough air.

the yellow tips are also black tips, even if you cannot see the black,

This is caused because the excess LP gas (fuel) is not getting enough air
(oxygen) to burn up completly,

If you used the burner it would deposit black soot on the bottom of the pan.
The black soot is the unburned gas fuel.

first make sure the burner itself is tight on the mixing tube.

If so, this might just be a simple adjust where you just have to add more air
(unless the gas volume is too high)

the gas is squirted through a tiny orifice into a long mixing chamber where
it is mixed with air. At the beginning of this chamber is a means of
adjusting the amount of sucked in added air. Usually this is just a circular
grate, such that when you twist the grate, you open up more area for the air
to get sucked into the mixing chamber, or you close off passages and block
off the entering air. In this case, maybe the air adjustment is exactly
correctly, but a bug, usually a spider, has entered the mixing chamber and
blocked off some of the air passages. So first look for the spider. If you
find a spider or a mud dauber wasp or what ever, then clean it out and test
the flame.

If no spider, you have to figure out how to adjust the air intake volume. If
the grate is loose, you must repair the grate mechanism to keep it stationary
in the correctly adjusted position, once you have found the correct position.
usually there is just a screw to tighten and losen to adjust the grate.

So, you need to trun the burner on FULL BLAST, light the burner
and carefully add a little more air. As you
add more air, the yellow flame will dissapear and you will begin to see THREE
colors of blue.  Hopefully you will be able to add too much air such that the
flame jumps away from the burner and leaves an empty gap and makes a bunch of
roaring noise. This is not the correct adjustment. The best adjustment is to
be able to add too much air and have the flame leave a gap at the burner,
then you take away some air, block off some of the air passage, and bring the
flame back to touching the burner. this is the best adjustment you can have.

I know how to properly adjust a COOKING STOVE  flame. This is really
different than adjusting an Oxygen-Acetylene welding torch or cutting torch
flame so don't flame me telling me I am wrong.

If you cannot add too much air and make the flame jump away from the burner,
that is okay, but not perfect. So just add as much air as you can and if the
yellow dissappears you are close enough to perfect and just tighten down the
air grate so that it does not change.

The complications come in because sometimes you have to adjust both the air
volume and the gas volume.

If you cannot add enough air to get rid of the yellow flame, then the gas is
too high. Most of the time, the gas orifice is adjustable. It has a tiny hole
that gets blocked off or opened up by an internal cone. So if you tighten the
orifice, you block off the gas hole size and less gas comes out. However,
some gas orifices are NOT adjustable and if you cannot add enough air to get
rid of the yellow flame, then the orifice hole size has been altered by some
idiot. and you better have a LP - Natural Gas technician correct the problem.

If you have an adjustable orifice, don't touch it. Don't mess with the gas
volume until you have tried to adjust the air volume. It is usually always
the air that gets messed up, because the mixing tube gets clogged up and
because the air adjustment grate is not tightened down and the air adjustment
has changed.

If you just have to add some gass, if you get too much gas, you can never add
enough air to get enough air to burn up all the fuel gas and the flame will
be yellow.

If you have too little gas, the flame length will be tiny, and you might get
a dangerous condition of a flame burning inside the mixing tube instead of
way out at the burner. The burner is designed to take the heat of a flame,
the mixing tube is not designed to take the heat of a flame. A flame in the
mixing tube can catch some other part of the stove on fire. If you have too
little gas, it is diffulcult to add any air at all because the flame will
just jump away from the burner and blow itself out.

The air grate must be open. You do not have the correct adjustment if you
have the air grate openings completely blocked off.

Very rarely, the gas orifice hole gets blocked off, sometimes you can clear
the obstruction by opening the orifice, (if adjustable) and allowing the gas
to blow out the junk. Then you return the orifice to its original setting.

You can NEVER stick something in the orifice to clean it out. If you have a
fixed size orifice you will ruin it. The gas volume is controled by the
precise size of the opening. You would not drill out a carburetor jet and you
cannot drill out an orifice. (okay, now for the technofreaks. Yes, you can
drill out an orifice to change from LP to Natural gas.but not from Natural
Gas to LP gas. You must use a chart to tell you the tiny tiny number size of
the number sized drill to use. You must know the BTU rating of the orifice in
the LP configuration. It is really complicated, so don't mess around unless
you have read and understood the technical literature)

If one burner is adjusted correctly, you can adjust the other burner to have
a similar flame pattern, size and color and silent sound.  If both, (all) the
burners are acting weird, you probably have a regulator problem. and time to
call in the expert.
