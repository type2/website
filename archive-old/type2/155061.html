Subject: Re: [T2] Blueprinted &amp; Balanced

I really hope I am not pissing everybody off, I am not rying to, I swear, BUT, some head professionals think polishing is bad, they port and then go back and sand the surface with really rough sandpaper, this creates a boundry layer like a golf ball and aids atomization.

I started this because I was curious if blueprinting was what I was taught it was.

&gt; It's like porting with out polishing--why bother to do one without the 
&gt; other?
