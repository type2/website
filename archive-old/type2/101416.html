Subject: Re: [T2] Friday's Mystery Part

Eric,


Look like a seal that is supposed to block an oil gallery hole to me.

They are *not* supposed to come out, which is why you won't find it in the 
book.....now some people take them out when they really want to do a 
serious job on the case or (in the t1 case) add full flow oiling.

Basically someone else is going to have to give a clue on this one as
I am not even sure where to get a replacement bung for it.

Cheers, dave

&gt; Thinking I had a blown rear main seal, I dropped my engine this morning only
&gt; to find the seal looking decent but a slightly crumpled piece of metal at the
&gt; bottom of the engine case. The piece of metal, pictured here:

&gt; 
&gt; Problem is, I can't find this cap in any of my manuals (Bentley, Haynes, Muir,
&gt; German VW Shop Manual). I need to be able to CALL my local part dealer since I
&gt; have to arrange transportation to get the part (can't just take it down and
&gt; show it to them).
&gt; 
&gt; Any help would be appreciated. This is a '74 1.7l manual...
