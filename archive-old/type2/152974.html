Subject: Automatic Transmission Leak

Hello Volkwageners-

I've got a pretty nasty transmission leak going these days. I don't
think I want to spew ATF all over mother earth anymore, so I replaced
the pan gasket and the screen. Now that the sucker is clean and that's
all done, it's still leaking just as bad, but now I can see it.

The ATF is coming from a disk on the filler tube side of the tranny.
It's about an inch or so above the pan gasket and it looks like it can
be popped out with a screwdriver (there are little notches on the
bottom and side of the case.). There is no mention of this part in my
manual, so I want to make sure it is safe to take this disk out and
seal it. I don't want the entire inside of my transmission to pop out
like a jack-in-the-box if I remove this. I also don't know if there is
a gasket that can be replaced in there or if I can just use RTV or if
it just needs to be cleaned and popped back in.

Thanks- Herb.
