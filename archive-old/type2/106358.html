Subject: help re-installing cylinders/heads on a two litreengine

They're supposed to SLIDE out?!

On my first engine teardown, (79 2.0L) We had to (had to?)
beat the living bejeezus out of those pins.

I'm talking 1/2&quot;x12&quot;L socket wrench extention on the pins and 
a BFH on the extention.

That C-Clamp sounds a lot smarter.

I had my type1 buddy guiding me on that one. Good guy, but not
exactly a DM believer.

There can be a varnish buildup that will prevent the pins from sliding out.  You will need to support the piston somehow and press the pins out.  I used a large C-clamp and some deep sockets.  Be careful not to mar the pistons.
