Subject: trans types


Ok what is the deference between a 3 rib and a 5 rib tranny???? my bus ( a
74, with a 2.0L ) has a 5 rib in it now but I droped the motor and tranny
last night and found a lot of play in the spline, it moves in and out about
1/4 on an inch and up down or side to side about the same 1/4 of an inch. I
have a 3 rib tranny that came out of a 72 bus, will there be any probs with
putting that one in?? It is real tight  and has no play in it. thanx
Ian
