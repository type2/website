&gt; What can I expect to pay to have some one fix my clutch?

Don't be too quick to blame the clutch.  Has the clutch pedal &quot;feel&quot;
suddenly changed?  If so, you have a bad clutch cable which isn't too bad
to replace.  If the clutch pedal feels the same as always and the clutch
doesn't disengage you've got a bad pilot bearing, which requires engine
removal.

Hope it's the first one!
