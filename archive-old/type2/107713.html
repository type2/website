Subject: Un-Screwed!

Fellow Listers-

On my 74 bus, while trying to figure out why I couldn't open the driver's
door from the inside I discovered that the screws that hold the latch
mechanism into the door are missing. Not the finger latch that you pull to
open the door, but the actual mechanism that latches over the post on the
door jamb. As far as I can tell, there are three screws that hold it: one
under the door panel and two through the end of the door. It's the two
through the end of the door that I need. Anyone know of a 'local' source for
these (Ace, Lowes, etc) or at least the diameter and pitch?

The reson I was working on this now is that yesterday my window fell into
the door. Upon inspection I see that the tab that screws onto the window
mechanism has broken off of the metal piece crimped to the bottom of tha
glass. Has anyone successfully repairedthis or am I looking at a new window?

Thanks in advance,
Dave
