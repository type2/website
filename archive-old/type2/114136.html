Subject: Re: [T2] Interior roofing

&gt;Yah, I see a lot of people like the wood look. Personally, I removed all 
&gt;the wood panelling and would never reinstall it.  I find it looks ugly. 
&gt;The white panelling looks brighter, cleaner and more stylish to me. For 
&gt;the roof, wood..naa.  When I am done I will take pictures for everyone.
&gt;
&gt;Interesting enough I've gotten lots of comments on what I should and 
&gt;shouldn't put up but what I was originally wanting was 'how' the stuff is 
&gt;secured to the roof.   Another thing I noticed about the old van roof is 
&gt;that it gets skinnier near the front and near the back. The middle is 
&gt;wider. Talk about a potential pain to precut something ;)  Maybe this 
&gt;weekend between Turkey dinners I will figure something out.

Understand. I like the OEM vinyl, OEM wood and the like but I plan on 
making wood panels, covering them in foam and then a tweed upholstery 
(called Monk's cloth). Something different and should help control noise.

Ummm, turkey.... Sounds GOOOD! Guess it's time for some lunch. Time to go 
warm up my Raimen noodles... Yuck! &lt;grin&gt;
