&gt;As the proud owner of a ´72 camper, I wouldn't trade her for for 
&gt;anything. But there is one thing that really gets to me -The lack 
&gt;of an overhead engine access that the other year models have. 

I don't know how you feel about cutting/welding, but your best bet would be
to cut out the section (about 2 inches bigger than the actual opening) from
the back of a 73-79 bus, cut out the corresponding part of yours, and have
the replacement section welded in.
