Or they could buy my Vanagon (with way less miles) for $1500. and make me
happy. Put a clutch in it and they'd have a nearly perfect bus! (Phoenix)

Agreed.  This sounds like a very good deal.  I already blew my 
money on another van, so I'm not going to jump all over this one.  
But if someone wants it who is not from that area (Palo Alto), I 
might be able to help them get a good deal on long distance 
transport.
