Subject: RE: [T2] Exhaust Leak Mystery Solved....

Ah yes! I have them as well.  Granted, I am only a year into VWs, but from 
my experience customizing a chevy 350, those are plugs where the EGR 
(exhaust gas recirculation) system used to be.  Takes some exhaust, 
redirects it back into the carb to get reburnt.  Cleans up the exhaust, but 
puts hot air into the intake, which everybody knows is just not cool.  
Thermodynamic efficiency here people!  But anyhow, yeah plug them all.  
Since you obviously dont have the EGR / Air Pump system anymore, as I dont, 
those things are no good to you except a new place to let out exahust.  And 
since you already figured that one out, Id say just plug them and let your 
muffler take care of the exhaust, thats what you pay it to do.

Im surprised your mechanic didnt realize this right off, unless he's not 
used to old cars?

Good luck!
