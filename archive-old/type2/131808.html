Subject: Re: [T2] Type 1 engine Alternator Wiring instead of Gen

Haaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaang on Snoopy....Snoopy hang on,


&gt;If I understand what y'all are saying correctly, I should:
&gt;Wire the 2 big red wires together
&gt;wire the lt blue (to instrument cluster) to the Blue/red striped wire that
&gt;went to generator

This is the setup for the internal regulator type of altenator, you would 
eliminate the existing regulator. If you have the external regulator type of 
altenator then you have to do it this way:

&gt;But if I do this, how do I incorporate the voltage regulator???
&gt;The alternator has the D+, D- and DF designations.
&gt;As for the regulator, it doesn't have these designations.  But the wires
&gt;going to the terminals are Red, brown and bluish-green

These connections should be made between the regulator and the alt.:
Brown          = D-
Bluish/Green  = DF
Red(small)     = D+


This should be the same for both types of altenators:

Red(big)       = B+  This goes straight to the starter/battery. The two big 
wires you connected together.



&gt;The wires I had hooked up for my generator's regulator were:
&gt;Big red wire from battery
&gt;Lt Blue wire (I think goes to instrument cluster)


Now there should be a blue wire(small) in there some where that is the
lead to your instrument cluster Generator Light, this has to be connected to 
D+ at the regulator side. You might have to splice this in.


&gt;Then the wires that went to generator:
&gt;Big red wire
&gt;blue/red stripe wire
&gt;brown wire

Is this a 70, 71 or a 72? There should have been a Green to the DF on the 
Gen. for 70 and 71. But process of elimination tells me the Blue/red is in 
place of your green, if it went to the regulator.

Later,
Michael Knight
