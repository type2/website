&gt; Well after 2.5 months, 2 emails, and trying to call Dawn _at_ her # posted

&gt; run for the border but I want to warn the list not to do business with 
&gt; PLF as she has apparently disappeared.

Not that this helps, but last I heard, Dawn off was traveling in NoCal for 
a couple of weeks.

If memory serves, other people have had timeliness issues with PLFVW in 
the past, although I believe those who have (eventually?) received their 
orders have been happy with the quality of the product (IIRC).

This is not to make any judgements on how PLFVW conducts their business, 
its just what I recall from being on the list for a while.

I can understand your frustration and am sorry you have had such 
a bad experience.
