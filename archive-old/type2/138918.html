&gt; But I still prefer the Type 4 engine myself, especially in
&gt; 1.8 to 2.0 liter configurations. Coupled with a superior camper layout
&gt; (the '76-up Westy has largely the same interior layout that continued all
&gt; the way through the Eurovan camper), this has made the '76-up my favorite
&gt; Westfalia.

If only you sold those!

&gt;fuel injection is more dependable
&gt; 
&gt; This actually began in '75 (or more accurately, late in '74), not in '76.

The 74 CA automatic models only. Pretty rare I'd say.
 
&gt; engine access is much better with removeable top hatch
&gt; 
&gt; This began in '73.

The 72 really is a model to avoid in my opinion. This will upset folks who
have them but if you have a choice get the non-72 body. If you are not
planning to work on it yourself your mechanic may take a look at it and make
up an excuse not to either. Viva la 73.

Didn't somebody want to know if the 72 had the paint can lid in the engine
compartment? It does.
