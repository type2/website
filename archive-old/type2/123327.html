Subject: door wiring

Oh mighty list....&lt;grin&gt;

I need some help(thinking outside the box).  If I were going to
install more than just a speaker in my doors(keyless entry) and wanted
a nice looking &quot;something&quot; to protect the wires between the door
and the door pillar, what would it be called.

On my F**d there is a very nice rubber belows arrangement that has a 
grommet that goes in a hole in the door and one in the door pillar with
a sealing grommet on each end.

Can these types of things be bought?  and what do you call them?  The 
F**d house says that they come &quot;on&quot; the harness and I can't buy them 
separately.

I've looked at &quot;hot rod&quot; sites, auto &quot;audio&quot; sites, and the mcmastercarr
book.

Anyone?....junk yards in this part of the country that are open
on saturday are hard to find....even harder to find are the ones
that will actually let you go *into* the yard and poke around.

Thanks ,dave
