&gt; Why drive your bus so fast?

yeah, mine will go faster than I will, try not to let her get over 65 if I
can help it.  She likes that speed and it's the speed limit on the
interstates around here anyway.
&gt; 
&gt; Those people in new junk cars drive fast for a reason.
&gt; They ain't got cool wheels.

yup, way cool!

&gt; Slow down and enjoy the ride.
&gt; Let your bus enjoy the ride.

good advice.

just back from a trip from Baltimore MD to Boston MA with 3 days in New
Haven, visit a list member (John Perry) in Fall River etc.  great trip
except for the 4th of July traffic on the way home,
