Subject: Matching Formica for mid-70's Westies

Some of the laminate on some of my cabinets has come loose and/or is
chipped.  I am pretty good at relaminating, *IF* I can find matching
laminate, but so far I have had little luck.

Has anyone found a decent match that is currently being manufactured?  The
closest I have found is a &quot;teak&quot; that is pretty good on color, but way
wide in grain pattern and, obviously, knot-free. 

It seems from a survey of my usual suppliers, that dark knotty pine
laminate has gone the way of loud plaids :-)
