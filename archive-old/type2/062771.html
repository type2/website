Subject: Condenser, points, steering box needed('72)

Hi y'all;
        I need the above for my '72 bus.  that is the 1700 motor.  I was 
planning on just buying the standard bosch points and condenser but 
figured that if anyone out there can recommend anything better or just 
happens to have some lying around it would be worth my while to ask.  I 
am also considering replacing my steering box before hunting season if 
anyone has a spare they want to Sell/trade/donate.
thanks.
Ed.
