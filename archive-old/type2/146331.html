Subject: Re: Solar Power and Second Battery

Harbor Freight has a 12 volt solar charger setup that is $249.  It is
constantly in their magazines that is mailed to me, but, I just tried to
find it online and was not successful, hopefully someone else will give
the part number.

It uses 3 -15 wat cells and it has stands.  It also has a charge
controller and what appears to be some compact flourescent bulbs fixtures.
 The material didn't say what those were for, but I suspect they are used
to &quot;bleed&quot; off electricity if it isn't being consumed/stored fast enough.

I plan on getting this setup for my bus.

I currently use a 5 watt panel from harbor freight with battery clips on
it.  I am not sure what the amp rating is, but it worked mostly ok at
Natural Bus this past year.  I hung ot on the side of my van and moved it
as the sun moved around.

Regards,

Mark

&gt; I've seen various battery + inverter packs for jump starting and
&gt; emergency power use and I've checked out some solar panels for
&gt; recharging 12v batteries. They all look interesting and feasible for
&gt; some 12v appliances (like air circulating fan and lighting) and 120v
&gt; for low wattage stuff (like computers etc). I'm interested in other
&gt; folks setups, how they connect the components and how feasible they
&gt; are for use in a camper. I'm not using power tools or microwaves but
&gt; simple low power appliances.
