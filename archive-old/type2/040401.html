&gt; Hey, I'm new to the list thing and I have some questions about my bus that 
&gt; I've always wanted to ask, but could never find knowledgable people.  If any 
&gt; of you can provide some answers I'd be gateful.
&gt; I've got a '77 standard bus with about 60k miles on the second engine (2.0l, 
&gt; mechanical valves), and the original trannie, it runs better than any of my 
&gt; other cars.
&gt; 
&gt; My Questions
&gt; 1. The gas question...is it really okay to run 87 octane?

Yes, if your engine isn't pinging you don't need higher octane.  The &quot;91&quot;
octane requirement is a european system whose ratings are a bit higher
than the american system.

&gt; 2. Oil-I live in sacramento, where it gets about 100 degrees on average in 
&gt; the summer-I'm using strait 30 weight now-should I change?

I'd recommend 10W40 or 20W50 in the summer.

&gt; 3. Speed-How fast should I drive on the freeway-it screams past 60mph

Drive the speed at which it seems happiest.  My '71 seems best around 58.

What happened to question #4?  Is this some sort of subtle Monty Python
joke?
 
&gt; 5. I'm taking it in for a paint job in a couple of weeks..the right rear 
&gt; panel is pretty rusted out around the bottom and around the battery tray 
&gt; (pretty common I guess) but was fixed with some emergency bondo and primer 
&gt; during the winter-should I replace it with a new panel? How much does it 
&gt; cost? Considering I've got less than two grand for the body and paint, I need 
&gt; a cost effective solution.

Without seeing it, best cheap bet is to clean out the bondo, clean up as
much of the rust as you can, and paint it with POR15.
&gt; 
&gt; Grateful for any help,
&gt; Matt S.

&gt; '77 Type 2 std. &quot;George&quot;

And you named your bus after me!  I'm flattered! :)
