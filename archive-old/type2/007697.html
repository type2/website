Subject: Power booster /steering box
Date: Fri, 13 Nov 1998 02:48:30 PST

Hey Y'all,
  I have a 70 Bus and it has the original drun brakes on it. I want to 
keep the drums but wanted to know if I could add a power booster. I have 
a 74 parts Bus with the booster and all of the relted parts. I know that 
I will have to use a 71 1600 dp intake manifold with the 1/2in outlet( i 
have one) and I also know that I will have to weld a bracket on to the 
front beam like the 74 has (I have a welder). What I wanted to know is, 
is there anything that I sould know before doing this? I will use the 70 
mastercylinder not the 74. The reason I want to do this is so my wife 
will feel comfortable driving it. It is not easy to stop in comparison 
to her 95 Dodge. Has anyone done this before? Any input would be great. 
When I do it I will post the results if its is a good thing.
  Also I want to put the steering box out of the 74 into the 70. Is this 
possible. I have been told that they are different, but can the swap be 
done? I don't mind a little modifing, I want the better box, mine is 
worn out. Any input here? If it works out I will post the how-to.
  I also asked about the oil gauge but forgot to put the sig.
Thanks,
