Subject: Re: [T2] .. A holley carb question

Dean,

Never used a Holley on a t4 engine, but used the old &quot;bug&quot; spray on lots 
of T1 engines.

The bug spray was designed for vw's, not sure that yours was.

You *need* the number off of the carb and you need to take a look at this 
book...

HOLLEY Carburetors by H.P. books
by Mike Urich and Bill Fisher
ASIN: 0912656077

When searched by the asin number above, amazon_dot_com had 7 new and used.
In my opinion, the book is invaluable if your really read and study it as 
it covers theory of operation for carbs....


If you pmail me the carb number I will see if this book covers it.

You then need to pull and rebuild it, or have a shop do it, or buy a 
rebuilt from your local flaps.  If it is truely a Pinto carb, then they 
will probably have it.

Do take it with you to the flaps, do *not* let them have the core until
you get the new one installed and running.

Make sure all ignition, ignition advance, vacuum advance and timing are 
*perfect* before doing carb work.

Cheers, dave

&gt; My 1700 (73 Sportsmobile) has a (single) Holley carb. 
&gt; Is the general sentiment for those the same as the
&gt; Weber?  
&gt; I was told by one guy that it was the same as on some
&gt; Pinto engines.  I've had trouble finding a filter and
&gt; ended up grinding the rubber off down to the metal of
&gt; the one I found to get it to fit.
&gt; 
&gt; Very little power after getting in gear, then after a
&gt; bit (3-6 seconds?...seems like an eternity ;-)) get
&gt; power gush and if I haven't lost enough speed can
&gt; accelerate. A friend described it as a &quot;flat spot&quot; and
&gt; suspected the carb. It has mostly sat for the last 5
&gt; years. New plugs/points/gas-line/etc. and timing by
&gt; local expert last fall before storage.
&gt; Seeing the recent dizzy discussion got me a bit
&gt; concerned it might be that. I sure hope not.
