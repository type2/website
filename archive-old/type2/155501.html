Subject: Re: [T2] Re: how do I install a baby seat in a bus

&gt; Some states might require LATCH:
&gt;
&gt; http://www_dot_car-safety_dot_org/latch.html
&gt;


Only if the vehicle supports it. Here's a quote from the site you found:

&quot;*Can I still use a LATCH carseat it in a vehicle that does not have
LATCH?*  Yes.  All new carseat models will be backward compatible with
seatbelt
installations.&quot;

I actually contacted Volvo America to see if my 244 could be retrofitted. I
was told no. Seatbelts are just as safe, but not as easy to CORRECTLY
install the seat. Cops do car-seat checkpoints every so often in Orange
County, CA, and I was told that only 1 in 10 are installed correctly. (BTW:
Mine passed!)
