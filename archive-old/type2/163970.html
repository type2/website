Thanks, John. I don't have the time -- or frankly, the interest -- to 
get into this full time. If I did five to ten of these a year, half for 
buses and half for family rooms, I'd be a happy camper.

The SO-23 has a certain kewl-ness factor -- it's the one you always see 
at shows with the old radio, ancient coke cooler, and picnic set-up up.

&gt; different companies making interiors in the U.K. - and, to my 
&gt; knowledge, none in N.A.
