Subject: Westy luggage rack mounting

&gt;How is the luggage rack mounted on a '68-'72 Westy?
&gt;In particular, what are the dimensions of the rubber 
&gt;spacers, and are spacers used on the front edge as well?

Busted Bus lists two different sized spacers at 30x40mm
and 40x26mm.  I belive the center spacer is the shorter
one.  I haven't been able to find replacements for
my squished ones.  Joe at Busted Bus no longer has 
any.  If anyone knows where I can get replacements, I'd 
like to hear about it.  The leading edge on my rack
('68) has thin rubber washers under each screw hole. 
I'd guess that they are about 5mm in thickness.

Hope that helps,
Brad Baker
