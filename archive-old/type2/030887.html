&gt; I have seen some literature that pictures T II/T1 (spilt-screen bus) with a
&gt; T III(1500) Squareback on the same spec chart and in that case the
&gt; squareback  is listed as a &quot;Variant.&quot; I've got the book in the bus somewhere
&gt; but you can prolly find on www.vintagebus_dot_cam.  Perhaps &quot;variant&quot; has a
&gt; generic translation from German that goes some like &quot;little station wagon&quot;

no the Variant was a type 3 

&gt; 
&gt; I was always curious about what the difference between the Type IV 411 and
&gt; 412 was. If you know p-mail.

Having owned one and still having the service manual, I checked.

411- 68-70  1700 carb
411- 70-72  1700 Fuel injected
412- 73-74  1800 Fuel injected

the 412 was a slightly different body style. 
all type 4's have disk front brakes and McPherson suspension system
