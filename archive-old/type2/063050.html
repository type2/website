On the way up to Vancouver I removed my Diesel badge before I approached
the Oregon state line.  You cannot pump your own fuel in Oregon and I
did not want a tankfull of Diesel.  The badge did not seem to ward off
tailgaters anyway.

In Oregon last month I used the key to unlock my gas cap.  To get it
loose you have to turn the key in the tumbler and unscrew the cap at
the same time.  I was having trouble coordinating these two and the
cap wouldn't come loose.  After struggling with it for 30 seconds the
attendant looked at me impatienty.  Finally I lifted the cap, then told
the fuel station attendant that my gas cap has a combination lock.
