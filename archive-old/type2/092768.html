Subject: Re: [T2]  Using SAE30 in 2.0 FI with Hydraulic lifters...

I'd have to wonder why the oil temps are so high all of the sudden. I have 
run 15W-50 Mobil 1 in mine for sometime and in all weathers and all is well.

I would be questioning if the engine is indeed making more heat, or the 
cooling (air or oil) system isn't removing the heat effectively.

It may be as simple as a dirty cooler or timing which has changed.

&gt;I've been using 20-50 in my 77 with good results however, I just arrived in
&gt;Tucson AZ a few days ago and despite driving through the night from San
&gt;Diego, the bus was just getting too hot to run over 52-53 mph. I'm planning
&gt;on driving all the way to the east coast and would like to run at about
&gt;60mph if I can keep the oil temp down. A local in Tucson recommended running
&gt;straight 30. Would running this heavy of an oil be bad for the Hydraulic
&gt;lifters?
&gt;
&gt;I know the oil topic has become a bit tiresome for a few of the elders out
&gt;there but any feed back would be great.
