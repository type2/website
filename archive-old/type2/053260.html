Hi everyone,

there are two deluxe Westfalias for sale around my neighborhood:

My friend Sam has a '78, limegreen, good body, great interior, replaced front beam 2 years ago, new shifter bushings, will need new tires soon. $3500

My '79 (white with green stripe) will be for sale towards the end of July (I am going back to Germany in August). Things I have done (during the past 1.5 years): replaced front axle beam, new ball joints, new steering pin, new steering coupler, has correct 185R14C tires (Bridgestone front, Avon rear), replaced engine (unknown milage, but no problems, 2L FI federal), new rear brakes, second battery (the biggest that would fit ...) with new Hella dual battery relay, new OEM 74 style VW muffler.
It has a very sturdy trailer hitch, front mounted spare (unfortunately ....).
With it comes my parts collection (essentially a 79 bus in boxes including tranny, nose skin, and front axle beam).
Problems it has: dented nose (front mounted spare ...), some rust (windshield frame, battery tray, lower door edges, but nothing structural). Passenger side heater box should be replaced before the next winter hits ...
Within the last year I drove this camper to SC, NC, MN, NY with no problems. I would take it across country at any time (I actually planned to drive out to the Rainbow gathering on the West Coast).
All together: $3500.

Cheers,
Marcus
