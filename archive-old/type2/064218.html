Yes.

I use CLR, which should be available at your local hardware store.  Its a
mild phosphoric acid solution.  I've used it straight for really rusty
stuff, and diluted for lighter rust.  Works really well, but you will have
to be patient, especially if you dilute it.  Its worth the wait.  

Rinse everything off really well afterward, and then get some paint on it as
soon as you can.

Eastwood sells a product called OxySolv which is basically the same thing,
except they sell it for $20 a bottle instead of $5 a bottle.

I've also tried hydrochloric acid, and while it worked much faster, it also
took off a lot more base metal than I would have like, and was not pleasant
at all to work with.  I don't recommend it.

I don't recommend you even think about sulphuric acid.  Period.
