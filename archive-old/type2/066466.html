&gt;       I have another question for the group.  How long can you keep a vw

&gt; misc. carb., generator, CV joints, batteries, brakes, front wheel
&gt; bearings, and a few other small things over the last 10 yrs., it seems to
&gt; be running o.k..  I'm waiting for the tranny, front end, steering box, and
&gt; master cylinder to go, but they haven't yet.  How many miles are on the
&gt; other buses out there?  Who's got the record?

C'mon John, &quot;I've had the same axe for thirty years.  Yeah, I changed the
handle five times and the head three times.&quot;  If you keep replacing
everything, I don't see why you can't keep a bus going forever, but is it
the same bus?  Let's get metaphysical.
