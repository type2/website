&gt; I'm looking for a pair of the heat riser covers and the heat riser cover
&gt; gaskets that mate up with the Pulley cover tin.  I'm still getting some
&gt; exhaust fumes into the heat and am trying to just get the engine compartment
&gt; completely sealed.  Does anyone have a set they'd part with or have a source
&gt; for where to get them? This is for a 1600 DP engine.

If someone finds these, let the list know!  I need them too!

&gt; Also, how does one remove the rear view mirror from a 71 bus?

At the base of the arm you will find two wrench flats on the lock ring.
Loosen the ring counterclockwise and then unscrew the mirror from its
socket in the door by spinning it round and round.
