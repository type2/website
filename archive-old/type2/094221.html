&gt; After 25,000 miles, the grease only side is slightly oily while the permatex

&gt; way, so I don't think it will be a problem.

I used self-adjusting RoboGrip pliers.  They're useless for most tasks but
they have rubber boots that go over the sharp jaws and are great for gently
wiggling out parts like push rod tubes.
