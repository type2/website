Any one know of some Junkyards in North Carolina, (northern) South Carolina
or Virginia for Bus parts.  I've got some leave I want to take and do some
Junkyard hopping. I found one here that has a couple of Bay Windows and one
VERY RUSTED Splitwindow that's been stripped.  Found one in the Virginia
area that I'm going to get the AC out of and bought a set of Dellorto's from
it last time.  It also has a Gene Berg shifter in it.

Dave
