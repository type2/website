&gt;&gt; I'm not trying to be an a$$ but this is my outlook on a thief , get a
*amn job and work for what you need or want as i have done for nearly 30
years now. I have worked my tail off to get what i have and i have no
tolerence for some low life thief thats too *amn sorry to work, and come in
and helps himself to what i have scrimped and saved to get. &lt;&lt;

Well you're making a lot of assumptions here.  You don't know that he
doesn't have a job.  I for one appreciate the way Jerry handled this.  It's
one of Jerry's qualities that I admire.  An emblem is not worth a life or
even an ass-kicking.  Fortunately for Jerry, some of his karmic generosity
came back to help him this time.  And I believe that Jerry will be rewarded
further for not posting the thief's name on the list.  I imagine that making
the AridZona VW community aware of his identity is warranted tho.

&quot;the music business is a cruel and shallow money trench,
a long plastic hallway where thieves and pimps run free,
and good men die like dogs. there's also a negative side.&quot;
