&lt;&lt; . Does anyone sell genuine VW
 cams? I did notice that European Motorworks (magazine ad) was much
 cheaper than the most discussed parts dealers on the list. Has anyone
 ever dealt with these guys? There price is about half of average but I
 don't want a &quot;peanut-butter&quot; cam. I want the real deal. Are these guys
 reputable? &gt;&gt;

European has been doing type 4 motors since the 70s ......they supply many of 
the type4 German firms with parts,  and have a complete machine shop

you can call them at 800-722-8678
