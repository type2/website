Subject: Need '72 Rear Bumper Brackets

A few weeks ago one of my neighbors backed into my '72 bus and pretty much
tore the rear bumper off.  Needless to say, this is not the first time the
rear bumper has been hit, and it is clear that the bumper brackets are in
less than safe condition.  I got a new bumper from Bus Depot, but can't find
a good set of rear bumper brackets anywhere near me.  Is anyone parting out
a '72 with a good set of brackets, or know of one in a yard?   I need to get
my baby back on the road, she just looks too sad sitting there with no rear
bumper...

Thanks in advance,
Jay Brown
