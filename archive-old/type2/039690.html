Subject: missing vacuum line

I was looking at my engine yesterday and I noticed a stray vacuum line. The 
line starts at the distributor and immediately hits a T then one goes 
straght to the front of the engine and hooks a right and hooks up to a 
doodad on the efi. This one is about 14&quot; long and goes straight across the 
engine towards the battery. Any idea where it goes? I figure it should hook 
up the engine block. Might improve my timing if the vacuum is increased, but 
I can't find a fitting anywhere? Help!

Muchos Gracias!
