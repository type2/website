Subject: [T2] Time for a new engine...( Many Questions)

Hello List,
I just got my '80 Westy back from the garage, with some tragic news:
My chronic oil leak is due to blow-by from the #3 cylinder. 
Compression readings (at 4500 ft above sea level) are :
#1: 115
#2  135
#3:  90
#4: 135

Looks like time for a rebuild. . .  

Are there any shops near Ogden, Utah that rebuild T4 engines well?
Will driving it in this condition ruin it beyond repair, or is it already too 
late?
If it's too far gone to be saved, where can I get a good rebuilt 2.0L T4?

Also, I've seen a lot of positive comments about souped-up T4 engines with 
upright cooling system conversions, on rec.autos.makers.vw.aircooled.  Has 
anyone installed one of these with good results?  Will it fit into a Vanagon 
engine bay?

Thanks in advance for any and all advice.
