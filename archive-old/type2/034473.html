Subject: more bus interior resto pix

i got a digital camera, so i finally took some new pictures of the interior
work i've been doing on my bus this fall. they're up at:
http://www.postforum_dot_com/perry/bus-resto/

if you've already seen the site, then you can pick up here:

my little heat blower experiment didn't work too well in the freezing cold.
i've got another couple of ideas planned for that problem. but when you're
just driving around the city it's not too bad [when the engine is revving,
at least]. there are some pictures of the setup on the site.
