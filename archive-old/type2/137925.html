&gt; I have mine on the #3 cyl plug between the plug washer and the plug. I get a

I posted this info the other day:

This article has some guidelines on acceptable readings for your CHT:

http://www.germansupply_dot_com/xcart/customer/home.php?gspage=customer/main/tech/cht/cht_install_4.tpl

This looks like you are within their suggestions since you are in the
400-425 range suggested for a bus.

For a second opinion, Fisher pp 89-90 has the following information
published by Chevrolet regarding Corvair head temps:

200-300 Idle
350-475 Cruise 30-60 mph
460-575 3-5K RPM full throttle

The Corvair head temp warning light comes on at 575 degrees.
