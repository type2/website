&gt; I bought a Coleman Black Cat heater last year and have used it extensivly
&gt; when camping in my bus, 1960 DD and love it. It is the top of the line model
&gt; with the battery operated fan. I turn it on a half hour before sleepy time
&gt; and when I go to bed it is toasty warm. A bottle of propane will last all
&gt; night. The only downfall is it really drys the air out, but a partially
&gt; opened window takes care of that. Well worth the 80 dollars it cost.

Keep in mind that these heaters use oxygen.  The newer ones supposedly
shut themselves off if the oxygen gets too low, but it is prudent to keep
a vent open.
