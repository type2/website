Subject: Re: [T2] US elections

Simple answer, Joaquim, neither one of the
presidential candidate's drives a bus or owns a T-2.
Now for some bus context, I just had a bus(1975)follow
me home(I have two already)from a friends
house(belongs to me)and have started to restore it,
wife is not happy with me. She will get over it. So
far I have sanded down all the rust and put POR-15 on
it, primed it with TIE-coat and am ready to paint.
Rebuilt the engine, carb, transmission shifts good,
going to re-bush the shifter rod, put new brakes all
the way around with new rubber hoses. I'm having the
most fun that you can have working on my baby. The
presidential race will take care of itself, all we
have to do is vote. Phil
