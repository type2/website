Subject: Re: [T2] Heating possiblities

brian, list,

i, for one, am very excited about this prospect!!! its
not even that expensive, and if i'm saying that...

however, this raises some questions.

 could one run this heater off of a car battery?

if so, would it be possible to rig up a third aux
battery and have the engine charge three batteries,
one for the engine, one for westfalia goodies plus
stereo, and one for heater. or is this just asking too
much?

my idea is to mount one of these heaters underneath my
rear bench seat, and give it a battery of its own.
thus be able to run the heater and use camper equip
without having the two &quot;arenas&quot; share power.

c'mon lets get some input here!
