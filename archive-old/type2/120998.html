Subject: Re: [T2] painting the tin (color other than black)

yeah.. it's that dust... and when you try and wipe it off of the matte
black finish, it just doesn't clean up nice... and I don't like the feel
of it..

and no, I don't plan on having alot of oil in there!!!  This engine has
been fully rebuilt and cleaned and I plan to keep it that way as long as
possible! ;)

&gt; &gt; I really wanted glossy black; that way the oil cleanup is easier.
&gt; &gt; However, they didn't have the high temp in glossy.
&gt; 
&gt; I hope you don't get as much oil as you're expecting. Mine just need a wipe
&gt; every now and then to remove the layer of dust and dirt.
