Subject: Need advice on engine choice....
Message-ID: &lt;Pine.SOL.4.20.0102160902210.15241-100000_at_csa.bu_dot_edu&gt;

Hi everyone. I need advice on a decision. I have 2 engines and one bus and
I need to choose between them. I'm really just looking for other peoples
opinions on which way to go.
Canidate #1:
 a 1967 Type 3 &quot;suitcase&quot; engine. rebuilt up to 1641cc with dual Weber
34ICTs, 009 distributor New Ps&amp;Cs, new German Heads.

Canidate #2:
 a well running, well maintained,very dirty '75 Type 4 engine: 1800cc
FI(out of my
old bus) I don't think its ever been properly rebuilt...could be wrong
(odm read 169,000 (!!!) who know whats on the engine)

I rebuilt the Type 3 engine myself and installed it, its running good, but
looks kind of weird in the bus. Cosmetically It was never meant to be
installed in a Type 2, but works ok.

My questions: How much of a PITA is it to Install a FI engine where a carb
engine was? I know I have to place the ECU somewhere... and there are some
wiring issues.. I have no idea what to do about those white connectors
that went in the upper left side of the FI engine compartment. How much of
a difference is there in power? Is a dual carb 1641 dramatically weaker
than a fuel-injected 1776? How 'bout the gas mileage? 

I spent a ton of cash on the Type 3 rebuild, and dont' really want to do
it again on the 1800cc...but both are gonna be used eventually....Which
would you rather have in *your* bus?

one last thing... anyone know if a '67 Type 3 engine would fit in a bug or
ghia?

thanks for any advice

Eddie
