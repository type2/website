Subject: Gearbox oil leak?  and spare tyre
Date: Sat, 28 Apr 2001 10:45:59 +0100
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;


I have pulled the gearbox and engine form my, 1974  1800 with Carbs, 
for the first time.

I notice when cleaning it the smell of the gunk on top of the gearbox is
a transmission oil smell.  This is the top of the gearbox at he front,
but on top not right at the front.

Is this anything (else) to worry about?

What should I look for to fix?

Spare tyre:

I have noticed some campers have the spare tyres on a flip down rack at
the back of the van, so that is somewhere else to put a full tyre if you
don't want one on the nose.
