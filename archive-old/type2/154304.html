Subject: Jerry Jess is back in the hospital

On 1/15/07 Jerry was admitted to Good Samaritan Hospital with a severe
urinary tract infection, rapid and irregular heartbeat, back pain and
disorientation.  He had passed out twice in 3 days and was very weak.

Any and all prayers, good thoughts or whatever positive energy you can send
his way would be much appreciated. 

It's only 3 months since his stroke and he has gone downhill very quickly.

Melissa

Jerry is in ICU and cannot have visitors. Also, there is no phone in his
room.  The doctors have determined that the urinary tract infection includes
a kidney infection-not good, he only has one working kidney.  Plus the
infection has gotten into his blood (sepsis).  He's getting large amounts of
antibiotics and they are doing daily tests to check his progress.  They
think they got it in time and that he will be OK.  It appears that he'll be
in the hospital for quite a while.  

I'll keep you updated.  Melissa
