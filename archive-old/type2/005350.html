Ken,
    Install a hot start relay.  Every bus should have one.  Go to Bartnick's
page on Type2_dot_com
Or, totally rewire all the ignition related components with new wire of the
appropriate gauge.  Old wire gets brittle, breaks insulation and generally
builds resistance.
Hot start relays are cheap &gt;$20-30 for parts.
Rewiring could cost more depending on how much your budget will allow.

on to progress.

&quot;My '70 Bus has devoloped this annoying habit of not starting when the
engines warm&quot;.
