&gt; This reminded me of the last time I took an engine out.

&gt; I seem to recall having loosened the transmission mounts so the tranny

I never loosen my tranny bolts.
But then again I have an auto tranny bus and the engines come out somewhat
differently,

&gt; Has anyone else done this (or am I starting to show signs of early
&gt; senility)?   ;-)

of all the things I've lost I miss my mind the most.

good luck, remember how it came out you still gotta put it back
