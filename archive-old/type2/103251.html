Subject: 71 westy

  My point on that was that for quite a while, the bus came with a 1600cc.  
So for many years wasn't it a bus engine?  I have a 71 1600 in my 69.  This 
is the bus case, not a beetle conversion.  My case has the holes in it to 
mount the crossmember.  The beetle motor did not have this.  The 71 engine 
seems to have plenty of pep, and being rebuilt by a reputable builder, I 
believe it will have no problems for quite a few years to come.  I have 
heard many argue that the 71 is the best model year.  ie: first year for 
front disc, only year with 1600cc dual port, early bay styling, removable 
rear apron.  I have a 69 and love the look of the old style wheels.  Some of 
the extra mechanical stuff I may have to go through, is well worth it, plus 
it is my zen time.  Just me, and the bus...    I think good, and bad things 
can be said about all years.
Their differences are what make them all have their own personality.  I 
think it is a matter of choice.  To each his own.  But they are all 
wonderful, lovely VW busses through, and through. ;)
