&gt; Has anyone had trouble getting a Westy through a seven foot high
&gt; garage door?

Whatever the height of your vehicle, make the door appreciably higher than
the bus.  Murphy says that no matter what height your bus is, you will do
something that makes it taller, such as taking out weight, putting on a
rack, changing tires, etc.

I've never heard anyone say &quot;dangit, I made that door too high!&quot;
