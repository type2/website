Check your local auto body supply. I painted my bus with acrylic enamel + a 
little hardener and the price wasn't much more than what you are paying for 
from S-W.

I have a pro auto body friend who recommended this paint for a cheap paint 
job and gives it a life expectancy of several years (or more if it is 
stored out of the weather).

Thanks to the hardener it can be color sanded to get rid of orange peel and 
other minor imperfections.

Be sure to get a good mask from the auto body supplier cause it's bad stuff 
I hear.

Another option would be a trip to your local Tractor Supply Store (or 
CO-OP) and buy implement paint. It's paint to be used on tractors. I don't 
know what type of paint it is but comes in $15 gallon cans - only thinner 
required to spray it. I used it on the pan of my Beetle with good results. 
Definitely cheap paint but pretty tough and certainly meant for harsh weather.

I recommend the acrylic enamel + hardener for body parts that show and the 
the tractor paint for underneath when you are on the cheap.

I could afford more expensive materials but right now my painting abilities 
are pretty basic and I create more flaws than the cheap paint does.
