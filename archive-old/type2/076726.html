Subject: Sucked a valve?

Hello list,

Had bugs/ghias for a while, but never had an engine fail.  I
bought a 77 bus - little tired outside, but no dents, just a
couple of rust holes - thought I'd try my hand at welding in
rust repair panels. No problem

Before I bought it, tested the compression -
112-115-119-115. Thought I had a strong motor.

The exhaust was noisy . It had a cracked header and rusted
through cross-over- I wrapped the crossover and had the
header welded... and I went through a learning curve on the
exhaust system with expectations of upgrading (downgrading)
to earlier exhaust system when my 'patches&quot; take a crap - no
problem, I'm prepared.

Anyway, here's the point and my question, ........After I
quieted it down by fixing the exhaust leak, it ran real
well. Real well! Thought I'd gotten a gem for $500.

Then, pow....while driving on straight and level, blew the
muffler off (I dont think the clamps were tight) and it just
quit. When tried to re-start it, all it does is turn over
(no perceptible noise) and puffs moderate amounts of black
smoke. No start, no run. Towed it home.

Recognizable symptom?  Similar experience, anyone?

A 'mildly' knowledgable VW friend says I sucked a valve. If
it is a sucked valve - serious damage anticipated?  a
trashed case, crank etc?  Or will it be as simple as getting
new heads... or am I just dreaming of an easy fix?

Any feedback you can provide before I break into her would
be appreicated.
