Subject: Re: [T2] weber progressive

patrick sounds like to me that maybe the carb is either out of adjustment or you have a vaccum leak... the weber progressive is one of the easiest to set its mix and idle thats it....
i dont reccomend that you go with duals if you can get your weber right though... even though the duals work better with electric chokes as don has said... the weber will have to be set up for the season.. this can be done by in the morning setting the choke to closed... let it warm up and make sure that the flap opens all the way open...
 
the weber in my opinion... is a good carb but that secondary on it will get you in the pocket on gas prices... 
i just recently went from a weber to a set of the duals that don is talking about and it has taken me it seems like a month or two to finally hopefully get them right,...
i bought them from cbperformance_dot_com as a kit for 319.00  thats included shipping....
they are the 34mm solex duals...
good luck ,.,.,.
i would seriously check that the doctor hooked everything back up right....
if it is stalling very well could be a vaccum leak...
if there is one thing i can tell you though its how to set that weber up..
you might want to check the intake boots also for the carb... if someone has used the manifold as a handle it could have split one and that will deffinetly cause stalling...at redlights and an uneven idle... also can be caused if you dont have the carb sitting on its mount and it just rest on the manifold..?shakling can cause the bottos to break after long use...
very carefully take a can of carb spray and with the engine running lightly spray the intake boot area and if the bus cuts back kinda bogs you wil know that the intake boot/s has a leak.... easy fix as well or can be...better to replace all four at same time....
be careful though dont forget that carb spray is very flammable..
peace
chris

hey,

ive got a 72 bus w/pancake engine, i believe its 1700. anyway, its got a 
weber progressive carb on it. im discouraged because i took it in to the 
doctor and after 400 dollars it runs worse than it has. symptoms are: wont 
idle steady, stalls out all the time if there is any nip to the air and wont 
accelerate like it use to. my question is &quot;is there anything i can do to 
this setup to get it drivable during the winter months&quot;. if not, which is 
what ive heard elsewhere, what carb set up is the best for it? are the 
dual kadrons from low bugget a good investment? will this get me on the 
road on real cold days?

any ideas would be great,
thanx,
patrick
