Subject: VW hall sender


&gt; Hi, Does anyone have any experience with the 79 bus hall sender standard
for
&gt; that year. I saw it in the VW parts manual. If it fits into a 78
distributor
&gt; would this not be a good substitute to a pertronix? VW quality at the same
&gt; price. What I would like to know is if this sender requires another
&gt; component to function or if it will function alone like the pertronix
does.

No, it will not fit in anything but a 79 Cal/80-83.5 Cal Vanagon
distributor. No way, no how. In order to use the Cal distributor you will
also need the electronic ignition coil, the module w/heatsink, and the
harness.  The coil and module is on Rabbits and Audis. The dist. and harness
is bus only.
With all the pieces it is a drop-in swap that works very well. I have 60,000
trouble-free miles on my 77 using it.
