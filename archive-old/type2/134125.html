Galvanizing is not completely impossible, as you do not neccesarily need
tanks. Plus, dipping the car in tanks (and there are tanks that are big
enough) would not help, because zinc can only adhere to clean metal and
there is not cost-efficient way to get all the dirt and rust out of
enclosed areas. Another issue to consider with traditional galvanization
is heat - it will wrap and distort all large body panels. There is a
process by which you spray melted zinc on sandblasted metal. I have no
idea how this porcess is called in English, in German it is
&quot;Flammspritzverzinken&quot;. I am considerung to this with the undercarriage
of one of my campers and an Opel. 

However, the real problem is rust that you do not see. Cars rust from
the inside out. By the time you see rust through on a rocker panel for
example, the panel is history because most likely rust has spread over
the entire panel on the inside and weakened the metal to the point that
rust broke through in one spot, but you really only see the tip of the
iceberg. To really prolong the life of your bus you have to fight rust
in the cavities and not hide the outside symptoms under POR or other
paint systems. This means that you need agents (oil, greas, or wax
based) that repel water and seal surfaces into these cavities.

Check out http://vwbus.dyndns_dot_org/bulli/michaelk/vw_bus_d/hohlraum.htm
for access to these cavities on a bus. This is a scan of VW's
instructions for the same job: http://vw-bus-online_dot_de/hohlraum.html
http://www.korrosionsschutz-depot_dot_de has a few interesting products for
this (and other rust prevention tasks), especially Owatrol and Mike
Sander's grease that are superior to wax-based products.
