&gt; 1. Single Weber progressive (not a good option as I understand)
&gt; Any views on the above are welcome, I did consider getting the twin dell's

As much as I hear people complaining about tuning their Weber progressives,
I have to admit mine has been pretty much maintenance free and very
reliable. When I got the Bus it was missing the FI and the progressive DFEV
was the cheapest way to see if the Bus even ran. I bought a complete used FI
for my Bus thinking I'd put it on when the Weber failed. Apart from slow
warm-ups on really cold mornings and having to re-jet a couple times ( I'm
at 6000ft) when I first got it, I've enjoyed the simplicity of it.
