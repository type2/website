Subject: Re: [T2] cam gear numbers - anyone?!

Hey James,
I am looking at my cam right now and the part number is:

   021.109.111B (vw logo) 9H

It is dark in complexion (about the color of an unpowered computer 
monitor screen), definately not shiney like my new cam gear, and I also 
found a -1 on the cam gear.  Does that mean it's made of the mag allow?

On my new webcam gear, it says:

   REPLACES 021 109 111C

the middle numbers (109) are hard to read, but I think that's what they 
say.  There are also no offset number markings.

So, here's what I'm thinking:  I'll take the original cam gear and drill 
out the rivets holding it to the original cam.  I'll then take that gear 
(marked &quot;-1&quot;) and bolt it to the new cam and test it in the case.  If 
that fits, see if webcam will exchange my unmarked (probably 0 gear) for 
a -1 gear.

sound like a good idea?

thanks,
Mike


&gt; new ones are going to be tough.  When cherry-picking gears off said wasted
&gt; cams, just watch out for the NON-aluminum ones used on early versions of
&gt; T4s, and promise yourself to ONLY use them for checking purposes.  They are
&gt; made out of the T1 case mag-alloy, and have been know to self-destruct with
&gt; horrible results.  I have one in my collection, a lovely example of the -4
&gt; flavor gear, very dark in complexion compared to the shiny aluminum variety.
&gt; When I spot faced it, the mag-alloy composition made itself known, and I
&gt; &quot;think&quot; it carries a &quot;B&quot; suffix to the p/n, as opposed to the &quot;C&quot; suffix of
&gt; the aluminum gears.  Or maybe its &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; - the point is that the
&gt; aluminum gear carries the further down in the alphabet suffix...
