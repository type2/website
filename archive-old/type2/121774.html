Subject: Re: [T2] finding #1 tdc firing position

Hello Mike     The way I put in the dizzy drive is to do it before putting 
the case together. I set the dizzy aand the drive on number one then when 
dropping the crank in  have the number one rod at it's top most postion, check the 
timimg marks on the crank gear they should be at the top. Later and have fun
