Hi folks,
     Experiencing technical difficulties. May end up having to have a 
tranny bearing fedexed to us, pretty sketchy right now. We may need a 
driveway to crash in for a few days. 2 possible routes, either I-40 out 
to Amarillo-ish, then down to 20, over and down to Austin on 183. Other 
possible route is 285 off of I-40, down through Roswell, to I-10. Any one 
on either of these routes please respond ASAP. I'm pretty worried about 
this bearing and want a safety blanket. Thanks. Will write more when time 
allows. Again, please respond ASAP, we're getting access at truck stops, 
don't know how long we'll be here or when our next access will be.

     BTW, part needed is the bearing on the left side of the tranny, 
behind the CV flange (the flat part where the CV and axle bolt to the 
tranny). If anybody has a clue for a shop that may have this part 
somewhere on either route, let me know ASAP, otherwise we'll have to have 
it fedexed out from CA-Meaning earliest possible arrival is Thur.

     We live in exciting times...  :-(


Peace,
