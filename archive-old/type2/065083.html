Subject: Creaks and Groans - Front end

Hey Now!

Looking for a little help with the front (and maybe back) end of my '70
camper - it's an area of cars I have never worked on...

The apt place I live in has wonderful speed bumps in our parking lot and
they provide the ol' bus with some tests each day.  And as I describe
the noises, please try not to laugh...the predominant noise is a
&quot;crunch&quot; type sound as I go up (crunch) and down (crunch)...I attribute
to shocks which look old as the bus itself.  Am I on the right path?
When I looked at them while pushing on the front bumper they didn't seem
to move at all...isn't that what they're for??  This noise happens both
in front and back (similar looking shocks back there) and seemed to be a
little louder last week in the mornings when the temp here was down to
the 30s...

Second is a brake related thing, I think.  When I press the brake pedal,
there is a noise I guess best described as a &quot;clicking&quot; which repeats
until I slow to around 20mph.

Any help would be appreciated...I am learning quickly a great deal about
the engine aspect of the bus but like I said am pretty ignorant in
diagnosing suspension related stuff...

Thanks a bunch!!
