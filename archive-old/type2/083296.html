Subject: Re: [T2] good anti-seize goop?

Tnx george,
I always take what the zeotry for and against
synthetic oil, anti-sieze, Marvel Mystery,
mechanical-adv. distributors  and the Holy Trinity
with a grain o' salt.

But I once stripped a plug hole, and it made me a
believer in doing *something*, if only for
superstition reasons.

Here's my idiot's response to the ton of valuable info
I've gathered on the list. Tell me if i'm courting
evil for my beloved '68:

1.I change the oil every 1,500 -2,000 miles, then it
doesn't matter if it's synthetic or not. AND CHECK IT
COMPULSIVELY.
2. To the best of my understanding, I buy quality
oil--and don't use additives.  (I use Rotella in the
summer, only because it also goes in my old diesel
Benz.)
3. I'll use barely a dab of the highest temperature
anti-seize I can find.
4. I don't fool with aftermarket oil coolers, filters,
etc. Mainly because I don't have enough $$$ for such
stuff and I drip enough oil already.
5. Violate #4 to put in a VDO temp gauge--and watch it
like a hawk.

Tnx to everyone who has helped me get the &quot;unnamed&quot;
bus on the road.
