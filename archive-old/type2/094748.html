Subject: no spark 



hey everyone,

   I am not getting any spark out of my coil.  i checked the points and 
adjusted them.  i replaced the coil, the condensor, and the voltage 
regulator.  I checked all fuses.  still no spark.  I even ran a patch wire 
from the hot wire on the voltage regulator to the positive on the coil, to 
bypass the ignition switch, and still not working.  the engine turns over 
but nothing will spark...... help please
