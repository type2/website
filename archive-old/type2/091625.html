Subject: '78 Bus - Engine dies when turning left

Hi All,

The engine in my bus loses all power (as if fuel or spark has been =
shutoff), when I make a left turn at speed. If I make the turn at 5 mph it =
is fine, but if there is any G-Force going on, the engine dies till the =
bus is going straight again. I've checked for lose connections as best as =
I can. The fuel filter is new and it happens regardless of level of gas in =
the tank.

Any ideas?

Thanks much!

Mark
