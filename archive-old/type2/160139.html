Subject: Buses By the Beach - Thank you for a real good time!

Thank you.Thank you.Thank you from Buses By the Beach!

 

Thanks for a wonderful weekend! We had a great time, a great turn out and a
very successful fund raiser. Preliminary numbers looks like we will have
risen through the matching grant foundation around $10,000 for Burn
Survivors! We also beat the Mustang club again for the third year in a row
for having the most cars at the Burn Survivor Car Show. The Mustang club
held that record for the first seven years of the car show. There were over
500 cars at the car show and I think I heard an early report that they had
raised over $16,000 for Burn Survivors. It was a very successful weekend and
it could have been possible without the love and support of bus friends like
you.

 

A special thanks goes out to GoWesty for being our 2005 &amp; 2006 Gold Level
Sponsor, and to all the volunteers that gave of themselves and their
resources to make this such a special event! We are so blessed to have the
greatest people on this planet coming to our events. I can honestly say that
in the four years we have been doing this we have never had someone come
that we wished would not come back. Bus people are the best!

 

If you came this weekend and had a great time we would love for you to post
a message to our forum to share your thoughts for someone that either could
not make it or maybe is thinking about coming in the future. The forum is
also a great way to make contact with some of your new friends that you have
made this weekend. Please click on the following link to post on the Buses
