Subject: Re: 84 Vanagon front seats

Does anyone know if the front seats out of an 84 Vanagon will work in a 73
Transporter?  I have found a pair long distance, but don't know if they will
work or not.  There are absolutely no wrecking yards anywhere near here that
have any Busses, so salvaging seats out of a wrecked Bus is not possible.
If these won't fit, does anyone have any they are willing to part with for a
nominal price plus shipping?  Thanks!
