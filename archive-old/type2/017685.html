Subject: EC coded engine case
Message-ID: &lt;3715BCE7.A27CDEBC_at_cais_dot_com&gt;

What's the story?

PO said he got a 'new' engine installed in his '77
bus.  The fan shroud is coded GD (correct, I
believe), but the case is stamped EC02738.

Muir said EC = Type III

Can a Type III case live happily within a '77 bus?

Should the EC case be giving the '77 bus the
hydraulic lifers?
Does the EC case do anything re: horsepower
increase/decrease?
Is this configuration worth saving??
Should I track down the shop which gave the PO
this EC case, and complain!!

Thanks for your responses
