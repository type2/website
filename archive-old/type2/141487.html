Subject: Re: [T2] Q about inspecting a new engine after assembly

I guess George has made the most relevant point so far!
Just to defend the author of the test results, he is a personal friend, and 
a 'degree' engineer like myself. With that in mind the test procedure was 
done in a controlled manner to ensure accurate results, and there's no 
profit to be made regardless of the results, so it's genuinely unbiased. In 
addition to that it's combined with years of real hands on experimenting 
with VW motors both by him and many others in the VW scene here in 
Australia.
I guess the only sad point is knowing the limitations of aircooled VW 
motor's he's now &quot;gone to the dark side&quot; and has a water-cooled motor in his 
Baja, and many others are follow the trend.
Regards,
Richard
