Subject: Re: [T2] Seat Repair

I used set from someplace in Ohio (he had the original green plaid) and they
worked very well.  I pulled the seats out, cleaned all the horse hair out of
them
and got them down to the springs, got the cushioning and put it on the seats
(at first I thought the cushions were too big, but they squashed down), then
pulled the two piece upholstered covering over the back (it was a bit
tricky, but
you just have to use a knee or two here and a little effort), tied it at the
bottom
using tiewraps (the nylon things, they were easier) instead of the hog rings
hiding the ugly part of the tiewrap so that hardly anything showed..  The
seat
bottoms had a cardboard edge sewn in them that inserted into a channel on
the bottom of the seats, it was the most challenging to squeeze it down to
make that happen.  But in the end they looked very nice.  Total cost: $200
(I
think)..  Took a 5000 miles trip after that and don't remember a single soar
back!  The job took me a couple evenings to complete leisurely.

Good luck,
Christopher Darilek

&gt; Hey Guys,
&gt;
&gt; Just curious if anyone has ever used one of the seat repair kits, the ones
&gt; that come with cushioning and hog ring pliers to basically re-upholster
your
&gt; seat?  How difficult is this project?  Are the results worthwhile?
&gt;
&gt; Thanks for your input.
&gt;
&gt; Sincerely,
&gt;
