&gt; &gt;The type 4 engine does have fairly high
&gt; &gt;compression, you wouldn't run a 60's muscle car on low octane would you?

the highest compresion &quot;Stock&quot; in a VW ac engine was the 1500S engine.
never offically exported to the USA, less than 10,000 ever built...12.8-1
was the claimed Compression Ratio.

I had to put 102 octane in mine to keep it from knocking!!!

this was a type 3 engine with domed pistons!  carried an engine prefix of
&quot;X&quot;

and the biggest pain to keep running right of any VW ac engine I ever met
 
&gt; &gt;engine.  The type 4 has so much torque, you can drive it like a water cooled
&gt; &gt;engine which is how a lot of people drive them.  If you don't keep your
&gt; &gt;engine at 3,000 - 3,500 RPM, you are burning it up.
&gt; 
&gt; I agree with one addition - this should only apply under heavy throttle 
&gt; conditions.  I think it's fine to lug the engine around town (within 
&gt; reason) since you will generally be only feathering the throttle.  You 

based on the auto tranny shift rates I would beg to disagree, I don't
think it is ever ok to lug an engine, IMO! but the auto tranny is set up
for that engine and weight combo and it will never let the engine lug
under any conditions. in 8 years with mine I have never been able to lug
it....(nor overev it for that matter)
