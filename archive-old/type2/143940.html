Subject: Re: [T2] 15&quot; Wheels in front, 14&quot; in Rear

&gt; The P/O had the disc brake conversion done on the bus (a '69 Westy),

&gt; Anyone had any thoughts on why?

Was this conversion done by installing '71-up parts, or was it an
aftermarket conversion using wide-5 rims?  If the latter, you might just
have a pair of Bug rims on the front that were laying around.

&gt; It looked like the 14-inch wheels up front would not have allowed for
&gt; clearance inside the rim for all the disc brake stuff, from what we
&gt; could see.

&gt; Big question is...WILL 14-inch wheels up front work?

14 inch wheels are stock on every baywindow I can think of!

It shouldn't hurt to go either way, 15s should work as well as 14s.
