&gt; Mark I see your point....I guess if you go to the junkyard you might

&gt; &quot;hmmm that bus has a good engine, I could rebuild it as a spare for my 
&gt; bus&quot;.

What happens just as often, I'll bet, is that some guy decides to sell 
his bus because he needs the money to pay the rent. A buyer shows up 
and says: &quot;I'll give you $300 for the whole bus, or $300 for just the 
engine and tranny.&quot; Smart buyer. The guy thinks he's ahead, but is 
stuck with the bus-no-engine. Then he has to wait around until someone 
else is willing to buy that.
