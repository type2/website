Subject: Re: oil heater

&gt;We were wondering if it would be safe to point the exhaust from a gas
&gt;heater towards the oil sump in order to warm the oil before staring the
&gt;engine.  We don't have our gas heater yet, however we would like to have
&gt;any tips etc...

  Well, Will and Angela, why not as long as nothing gets too hot.

 I imagine in some places they still drain the oil and put on the 
 back of the stove all nite. Used to up in Alaska.

 A simple light bulb will work too.

 Anyway just check it a few times to see it's stable and not too warm 
and you'll be alright.

 Getting frosty up there is it? :-)
