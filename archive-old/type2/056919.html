Dear List,

I'll make it short and sweet.  1976 Type II, original starter failed
replaced with rebuild, after a short period of time (3 months) started 
to sporadically refuse to engage, installed WR-1 kit, worked for two
months, starter failed (completely burned out), replaced with new
rebuild and disconected WR-1 unit(thinking that this might have
something to do with burn up), new starter acting sluggish and showing
signs of failure after only one week.

Help!!
