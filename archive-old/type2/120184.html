Subject: Re: [T2] Re: OEM Fog Lamps?

I wouldn't be surprised to find some in it. I was
talking about OEM lights, not dealer-installed
accessories that were sold-by and approved-by VWoA.
VWoA is/was the importer, not the manufacturer. They
approved / sold / and in some cases installed
accessories that were not &quot;factory&quot;. For example, take
&quot;factory air conditioning&quot;. The air conditioners sold
by VW dealers for air cooled models were not German.
They were installed here in the US of A. In most cases
by the individual dealers but for a while the dealers
could order vehicles with AC. Those AC units were
installed in shops run by the air conditioner
manufacturers. The one for VW south central was
located at the port of Houston and VWs from there were
shipped to dealers in Texas, New Mexico, Oklahoma,
Colorado, and Wyoming. OEM means ooriginalequipment
manufacturer, not ooriginalaccessories installed after
manufacture.
