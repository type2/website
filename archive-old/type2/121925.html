Subject: Re: [T2] Vacuum can replacement

Matt,
Guessing from the e-mail address that you are in Calgary...

I got in touch with Concept 1 here in Calgary when I got a new 
condenser for my dizzy and they ordered it in for me in days, they are 
super friendly and their prices are pretty good, they often have the 
parts in stock (like my Clutch cable when it went last ... ) I don't 
know if you can just replace the Vac Can and couldn't tell you for sure 
if they have them in stock but its worth a call.

Steve
