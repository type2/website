&gt; &gt;These were 'popular' aftermarket items, Kamei made them in the past,
&gt; &gt;for Bugs, Buses, VW used them on the Thing/181, and the have been
&gt; &gt;copied by many fiberglass 'specialists'.
&gt;
&gt;Not for Baywindow busses. I have only seen them for 67 and older busses
and
&gt;vehicles with &quot;flat&quot; air intakes like the 181.

Just to nitpick (like everyone else) VW did increase the size of the upper
scoops on the later bays. No idea what the exact year was but on later bays
the scoop is the same height but sticks out more into the air stream. And
yes they did make fiberglass extensions for the early bay scoops.

Someone did point out once that the 67 and older aftermarket scoops
probably reduced airflow since they had a smaller cross section open to
take air in then did the louvers by themselves.

My cousin has a very nice unrestored 71 Gran Torino Fastback Talladega
(sp?) with a huge engine and... &quot;ram (or is it &quot;cold&quot;) air induction&quot;  that
is controlled by manifold vacuum. (For sale for $12K if anyone needs a 8MPG
commuter :-)) Any benefit to adding a 3rd scoop that is ducted to the air
horn on the air box to provide cooler outside air for the engine, or is air
flow such in the engine compartment (as is being discussed here, positive
vs negative pressure or attitude or something :-) ) that the intake air
never gets heated up?
