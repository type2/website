It is less of a switch and more of a push pull knob.Pull it out and heat
comes out of the vent below the walk through. Push it in and it shuts off.
Not sure if 74 works this way but the 67 69 and 72 we have do.

&gt;Second, Would my 74 bus have the control switch for the heat
&gt;vent in the middle of the floor? It has always been on and I hven't seen a
&gt;switch under my seat that would control it, it would be nice to end that
&gt;extra heat up front.
