Subject: Re: [T2] Removing Tail Lights (78 Westy)

----- Original Message ----- 
From: &quot;Zachary Brennan&quot;


 I'm trying to take the crumbling tail light assemblies off a 78. I can
see that the embedded bolts are held on by 4 nuts on the inside of the
engine compartment. The problem is actually getting these nuts off. I
used an 8mm wrench to get a couple of them off, but the others seem
pretty inaccessible. I can't get a socket over them because the bolts
are too long. Also, on the right side, do I need to remove the black
cylinder that connects to the air filter (not sure what this is...)
Did anybody else have this trouble or have any tips?


You need a 8mm deep socket.

And yes, the charcoal cannister does get in the way and you should remove and put it back in and hook the
hoses up correctly.
