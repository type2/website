Subject: Fule line in gas tank area

Am going to drop the engine to do some work and figured I would go ahead and
swap the gas tank while I was in there, have a fresh one all treated and
ready :)  What size fuel line will I need to replace all that is in that
compartment?

Also anyone know the size of the 2 inch piece of rubber line that is above
the aux battery compartment?

If it matters this is all on a 73 bus...

Thanks in advance,

Peace Brothers and Sisters,
Snoopy
