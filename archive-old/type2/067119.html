Subject: Washington DC: Free Rotors! 73-79

Any local Washington DC baywindow owners need brake rotors?

H. Steve Dolan and Pat Flynn: (And other Washington DC Locals)

I got a set of front brake stuff at the last Bugout.
Part of the score was a pair of used, never cut front 
rotors. I was told that they were for '71-72 busses.
But, they are not. They are the '73-'79 style rotors.
The offset is just a little off from the ones I need,
but they dont fit. I even cleaned, trued, and painted
the pair.

So, if you have anything you want to trade for them,
like (H Steve...) a westy table, or some rear side
markers, or some spare cables, or anything,I would love to give 
this pair to someone who can use them.
