Subject: Re: Lighting trouble solved

Oopss. I goofed.. the big silver one with the red writing on it is the turn
signal relay, I also have a large plastic after-market black one (first one
in the series), and a small silver one on the end.

I took the relays apart and cleaned them... and put them back in..

My lights are no longer stuck on high... they now are stuck on lo.

I noticed a bit of corrosion on the black relay circuit, which I cleaned off
with a nylon brush... I think that is the shot headlight relay as this seems
to have made a difference...(eg stuck on hi to stuck on lo beam and my
control panel dimmer switch works now)

Tomorrow I will get a new one... this aftermarket one is made by &quot;hella&quot; and
I remember they make off-road lights and by the sounds of the other posts
this should be the light relay... 

Thanks for help guys!

Brian
