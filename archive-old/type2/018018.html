&gt; &quot;As you know manifold pressure changes with throttle opening.  If fuel
&gt; pressure were constant for all manifold pressures, then at low engine loads,
&gt; with the throttle partially closed, reduced manifold absolute pressure would
&gt; increase fuel delivery.  To keep that relative pressure constant as the
&gt; throttle is opened and closed, the fuel pressure regulator is connected to
&gt; intake manifold by a vacuum hose.  Manifold pressure acts on the diaphragm
&gt; to hold relative pressure constant.&quot;

Thanks for posting John, turns out that Edward was much righter than me
:-)
Steve Dolan also wrote me and told me that when he had the fuel pressure
gauge hooked up to his engine he noticed that it varied nicely with
manifold vacuum.

I learned something new today!  Thanks Edward, John, and Steve.

That Bosch book is pretty good, gotta go back and read it again :-)
