&gt;Hi again all,
&gt;
&gt;Has anyone else seen this?  Ya think I need a new starter?? Or just keep a
&gt;hammer in the bus?
&gt;

Verify battery condition and voltage, all cable terminals clean and tight
both ends, check the ground strap as well at the front of the tranny. Make
the connections clean and tight. Still have a problem?? Check the voltage
drop from batt+ to the ignition starter feed. Got at least 9.5 volts?? You
have the common symtom of a worn out starter. Put in a Bosch Reman and be
happy for another 20 years.
