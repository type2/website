Subject: timing an engine statically

I took out the distributor on the 71.  It was not where i wanted it to be so 
i seriously must of just wacked it out of timing!  None the less I need to 
get this puppy timed as the roadtrip is already planned.  It is not starting 
at all only turning over.  What can I do to time it statically?  I need 
detailed instructions!!
