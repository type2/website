Subject: hole in master cylinder

Howdy folks,    I'm in the middle of installing my new master cylinder on my 
'72 bus.  I have the lines connected, and the fluid tank line and I notice 
something odd.  On the bottom of the metal part that bolts with two bolts to 
the vacuum chamber there is a small hole.  Looks like it has been drilled 
right through to the inside of the vacuum chamber.  The MC  I removed didn't 
have this!  So, did someone drill the hole there then decide to bring the 
part back to my local FLAPS so I could buy it and get this far?  What would 
be the reason to drill a hole there, and what will it affect?  I'd just as 
soon go back and get an untouched one.  Bummer that each time I do it it's a 
70 mile round trip and I'd just like to get the bus brakes working and get 
it on the road.    Ideas?? Answers??   TIA,  Kevin  Snow
