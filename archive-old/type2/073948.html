Subject: RE: [T2] Syn oil to regular oil- Dangerous?

I am a distributor for Amsoil.  Amsoil developed synthetic oil for the Air
Force long before Mobil ever thought they could market it.  There are two
things that Synthetic oil offers engines. 1) Viscosity is stable from
extremely cold temperatures to extremely hot ones. This means easy starting
and quick oil pressure in sub zero conditions and no boiling off, leaving
waxes &amp; sludge at high temps. Synthetic gear oils make your trnsmission
shift as easily in the winter as it does in the summer. 2) less friction is
afforded by highre wear protection,  this gives you better mileage.  These 2
thing combined mean the oil last longer like 10,000 miles, and only needs
changing to remove wear partices not trapped in filters.  In fact many
truckers and fleet owners run dual remote filters and only change oil when
oil analysis indicates high levels of contaminates 20-30,000 miles. If you
are aiming to get extended drain intrvals from the use of synthetic you must
use really good oil filters like hasting who makes them for Amsoil which
filter down to 1-5 microns and of course have anti-drain back valves.

Now saying all that I will also say it is not for every engine.  If your
engine is already worn, 60,000-100,000 miles it is usually not worht using
synthetic since you will be burning it.  You also do not want to break in a
newly rebuilt engine with it as it is too slippery and rings won't seat
properly.  Run natural oil for the first 3,000- 10,000 miles and then switch
to synthetic.

       I was recently told by my mechanic that regular 30W was the preferred

oil for the type 4 engines. Of course we are talking about the vanagons but,

he told me the synthetic just didn't do the job that was meant by regular 
oil. He said synthetic was &quot;too clean.&quot;
     Of course I use synthetic in mine and the whole oil debate is like a 
presidential smear campaign but, I don't truly know enough about it. I've 
always heard that synthetic oils are usually best for older engines while 
the standard is best for newer/rebuilt ones.
   I've almost always had older (100+k) vehicles so I've always used 
synthetic motor oil. Whether it helps or not I have no idea. My bus still 
uses about half a quart (sometimes) between gas tanks. But, this is also 
cause I haven't had the time, nor cash cause I've been fixing other things 
all summer, to rebuild heads, valves, and replace pushrod tubes and seals.
    So, in all this, I think you'll hear all kinds of advice. I usually try 
to listen to someone who sounds very smart worthy and keep that one to make 
my own decision. Take all the knowledge you can get and then make a choice.

  Good luck!

Joel,

Yes, it's expensive, but I believe it is worth it.

I don't change oil every 3,000 if I use synthetic....that is sure to get a
few flames&lt;grin&gt;.

Some of my cars use syn and some I use the reular stuff.

In my opinion....the synthetic lasts longer than dino.

I have some water cooled vehicles that I use only synthetic...go 10,000
miles between changes.  I *never* use any oil between changes in them and
I drive them hard.  The last one I treated that way had 127,000 on it and
still used *no* oil between changes...

As always....Your mileage may vary.  :-)

Cheers ,dave

 &gt; Volks,
 &gt; 	I'm looking at a vanagon that all it's life has had a diet of Mobil

 &gt; Synthetic oil. Being on the  verge of owning this van, and seeing how
 &gt; EXPENSIVE synthetic motor oils are, I'm wondering if it really is 
necessary
 &gt; to continue using the synthetic stuff. The van already has 130K on it and
 &gt; I'm looking for another 75K or so from it (without a rebuild (yes, it is
 &gt; totally possible)). Does anyone out there have any experience with 
switching?
 &gt; I guess I've just never been convinced of the advantages of the synthetic
 &gt; stuff; at least not convinced enough to go from about a buck a quart to
 &gt; almost 4 bucks a quart.
 &gt; My &quot;head smarts&quot; are telling me to just bite the bullet and keep going 
with
 &gt; the synthetic, but my wife (and our one income and two children) are 
making
 &gt; me look into the possibility of doing it cheaper.
 &gt; I always get ADVICE when I post to the lists, but what I really want is
 &gt; actual, real world, experiences. Of course, all responses, experience or
 &gt; otherwise, will be greatly appreciated.
 &gt; Thanks,
 &gt; Joel
