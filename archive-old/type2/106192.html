Subject: Re: [T2] engine/tranny drop: different CV Joint bolts

&gt; I believe I may be up a creek here, but... reading Sean Barntik's tutorial on
&gt; engine removal, I went to take the CV s off to be able to drop the tranny with
&gt; the vehicle and low and behold, I have a random assortment of both 6mm allen
&gt; head bolts AND 12 point Porsche replacement bolts present. The creek comes in
&gt; when I didn't realize I had the 12 pointers till I stripped a couple out with
&gt; the 6mm allen wrench. My question then is, how do I get these things off now
&gt; and/or should I just leave the tranny in and muscle my way through dropping
&gt; the engine out alone? Any advice would be greatly appreciated...

Time for the big vise grips!  If you're talking Vanagon here I hope that
you didn't mess up the ones on the wheel end of the axles!  If you did,
it's drill time :(
