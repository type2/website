Subject: PB Blaster &amp; south Georgia

Where can you buy PB Blaster, other than from the company website?

I had considered driving Broomhilda from Atlanta to a small town in North 
Florida (Cedar Key), but since we don't know where to find reliable VW shops in 
south Georgia or northern Florida.  Internet searches revealed several shops in 
Valdosta.

Also, does anyone have suggestions on what route to follow?  I-75  might have 
more shops near it, but Broomhilda doesn't like going much over 55, so I-75  can 
get a little hairy.  There is something called the Georgia-Florida Parkway which 
is a divided highway that runs from I-75 through Albany to Florida's Nature 
Coast  (built for hurrican evacuation?).  Any decent mechanics in Albany?

Thanks,

Ev &amp; Tom &amp; Broomhilda
