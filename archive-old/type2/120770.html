Subject: San Francisco Mechanics?

Hi everyone,

	I searched the list archives and got a few ideas (buslab in berkeley 
and Fred's in Redwood City?) but wanted to see if anyone had an 
air-cooled suggestion for in city SF.
	For background, I limped my red 1975 Riviera down from Seattle back in 
August and have been avoiding street sweeping tickets while saving 
money to get my baby running right. I'd attempt the project myself 
(engine drop to replace seals, install new gas tank, and troubleshoot 
and electrical issue), but have nowhere to work.
	So, if you've got suggestions for quality shops (I've got some $$ 
saved) or maybe a garage/driveway and a bit of spare time to help a new 
bus owner with his first engine pull...let me know.

Thanks and happy Tuesday,
Mark D.
