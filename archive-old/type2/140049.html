Subject: Re: [T2] Snap-on is crazy

Hello Mark  I suspect what your problem is you are buying online and not off 
a Snap-on dealer truck.  I have a regular dealer that stops by every tuesday . 
I never have any problems cause the dealer handles it , sells the tools with 
payments, also you get to check the tool out and make sure it is what you 
want.   I dont think that they are set up to sell to the general public but only 
to shops. They also will give loaner tools when you do have to send one of 
yours for repair.  You can say what you want but they do make the best tools and 
give excellent service if you are at a shop. And NO you cant borrow my snap -on 
tools  thank you very much.   Bus content  very close to paint time for steve 
Dolans 67 westy body work has progressed very well this week ,         
hopefully painted next week then it will be reassembled using Snap- on tools.   
later and have fun  Mark Dearing  Salem Import Service  Salem va
