Subject: RE: [T2] selenoid for starter

This looks like a job for the Hot Start Relay Man!  Actually, this could be
caused by one several things:

1) Battery (you said it's good)
2) Old solenoid. This is common.
3) Old wiring. This is almost universal. The starter current is actually
routed to the dashboard and back...this long wire run and connections
eventually develops high resistance, which reduces the voltage available to
the starter/solenoid.

Most hot start problems are actually a combination of 2) &amp; 3) above. If you
replace the starter solenoid, it will probably work OK for a period of time,
but will eventually come back as your solenoid ages. Most older bus ownwers
install a hot start relay which feeds the starter directly from the battery,
bypassing the long wire run. See the Type2 library for instructions on this,
it's pretty easy and should solve your problems for a long while. Without
the relay, you end up replacing solenoids fairly often, as soon as they
start to get tired.

Look under the bus; you might already have a relay, in which case replace
the solenoid. It's a PITA to get off the starter, but cheaper than a whole
new starter assembly.

 I've run into a few times when I go to start the van
and I simply hear a click but no starter. Battery is good
connection is good, no corrosion on posts or stuff.


Got reading one of the books and it suggests the selenoid
is bad. I had gotten underneath the van and hit it a few times
