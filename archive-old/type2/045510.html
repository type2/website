Subject: Re: [T2] Hydraulic lifters for '75 1.8...question

Why is the cam not compatible??
I have been running hydraulics on solid cams in 2 77 Westies for over 6
years now. My daily driver has over 65,000 trouble-free miles on it and my
daughter has over 60,000 miles on hers. All I changed were the lifters,
pushrods, and rocker arm spacers.

I took one each of the cams, a solid and a hydraulic, to an engine machine
shop and had the cam grinder measure them. The lift, duration, overlap, and
ramp speed were identical. He said they were the same.

If you read in the Bentley in section 5, page 59 it says:
&quot;The camshafts for dual-carb or FI engines used with manual transmissions
are different from those used with automatic transmissions.  The camshafts
for engines used with automatic transmissions have 2 narrow bands cast into
the shaft on each side of the center bearing journal. &lt;snip the pic
reference&gt;  Camshafts for hydraulic lifters have no cast bands at the center
bearing.&quot;

If manual trans cams and hydraulic lifter cams don't have cast bands and the
specs are the same, where is the 'non-compatible'  info coming from??

&gt; to make the conversion you must change lifters, and have a COMPATIBLE cam
&gt; (the stock solid lifter cam is NOT), and remove the spring spacer on the
&gt; rocker arms and replace it with solid shim stock. Heavier valve springs
are
&gt; nice, but not required.
