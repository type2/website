Subject: Re: [T2] another  engine heating question

Tom,


&lt;sigh&gt;
In an aircooled engine, any air that goes where it is not supposed to, or 
doesn't go where it *is* supposed to, is *bad*.

Put hoses on, seal them, whatever it takes.

Retarded timing may cause overheating.

Depends on how much and lots of other factors.

Why have you got it retarded???  Put it where factory specs
say to and go from there.

How hot is too hot???

Cheers, dave

&gt; Do I need to have the holes for the fresh air fan hoses plugged 
or are they ok with nothing on them?  also, would having my timing to retarded cause excess heating?
