Subject: Re: [T2] Mystery switch



&gt; I recently purchased a 1970 Westy.  While I was cleaning out the front of the bus I noticed a pull switch of somekind built into the 
drivers seat pedistal.  Can anyone give a hint as to what this might be?  It looks almost like a manual choke cable, but I have pretty much 
disproved that idea since this bus has an electric choke.

It's the ultra rare ejection seat control, installed only on German Secret Service buses!

No, actually it controls the heater vent that exits through the slot in the floor even with the rear bulkheads.  This supplies heat to the 
middle seat passengers.  To work, the cable must be good and the paper hose under the bus must be intact.
