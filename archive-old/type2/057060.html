&gt; I got in the Bus. Turned the key and not one sound. Nothing. So I rolled it

&gt; has done this in the past it is the same thing. And once it happens it might
&gt; be months before it does it again.

Could be the classic resistance problem in the wiring, OR, it could be the
beginning of a bad starter.  It took mine over 6 months to die completely
(and now i'm running on a loaner, till i cna replace it..thanks Ric!:)....

&gt;   2. What is the best muffler I can get for a reasonable price? reasonable
&gt; being up to around 200.00. The Bus sounds like a sick Harley. ( Oh, I have a
&gt; 1970 )

Best?  The stock Leistritz single outlet muffler, of course.  Unless they
are still backordered, i'm sure the list vendors can get you a complete
kit.  Should DEFINITLY run under 200 bucks. (mine was ~80, but Ron was
running a special on them early last year..)  check with Ron, Jim, or
Kyle.....

you can also go with a Kadron stock-style exhaust, but i've found the
quality to be less than satisfactory.

And while we're on the subject, I do not personally advise the use of
SJS's exhaust gaskets and clamps.  I ordered a new set of Leistritz
(everytime ya take the muffler off, ya gotta change those donuts!) ones,
but they were on backorder from Germany...So i was sent SJS..I installed
them, one of the clamps busted before reaching the proper tightness, so i
reused a good old one.  Both of the donuts had disentigrated and burned
holes in them after ~1500 miles.  this isnt the first time i've seen this
with SJS gaskets.  I used them numerous times before (on this bus, and on
my bugs before) but alwasys figured it was the way it was supposed to
be...until i used the much higher quality Leistritz gaskets.  But i
digress.:)

&gt;   3.Where can I get, and can they be installed, seatbelts for the backseat of
&gt; the Bus. I have a camper bed seat back there. 

Any ol' lap style seatbelt will do, but you'll be better of getting them
out of another bus, if the astetics mean anythign to you..:)  As for
installation, use the bolts you remove to get them out of the other bus,
and bolt them into the holes inder the plastic covers under the Zbed...:)
Fairly simple.:)

later...david
