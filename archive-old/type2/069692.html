Subject: &quot;Frankenstien&quot; bus (was Historical...)

Lisa Quinn asked what Ellis meant by the reference to a &quot;Frankenstien&quot; bus...

I meant to indicate the various stories and factual accounts of VW bus type
vehicles that have been manufactured and sold in South America (Chile,
Argentina, Brazil, Mexico etc.) which look like a mixture of what we refer
to as the typical '68-'79 &quot;Bay Window&quot; style but with rear corner windows
and early style interior panel material (mint field and darker green
stripped/houndstooth etc.) or Salt and Pepper seat material. One such bus
was owned for a short time by Dan Lawson, owner of Competition Enginering,
Phoenix, AZ, USA. This bus was an example of all of the above. The VW emblem
was stamped into the front sheet metal compared to the US standard of a
separate emblem that was attached to the nose. To clarify, the emblem stuck
&quot;out&quot; of the surface of the nose skin. It also had disk brakes in the front
but had the old style reduction box swing axle tranny instead of the IRS
tranny. The tail lights were of the 63(?)-71(?) style. The front nose
resembled a 70's vintage. Dan appropriately dubbed it the &quot;Frankenstein&quot; bus
refering to the monster created out of misc. parts.
