&gt;I guess the 2000l FI engine doesn't smell as much.

&gt;I wonder do campers have cooking smells? You know, hot cooking oil, burnt
&gt;eggs, bacon and such.

My camper smells like desert sage, thanks to the dried bundle of same that
Jack Stafford gave me at the Mammoth campout.  It's a welcome reminder of
where I used to camp so often.  Thanks Jack!!!
