&gt;I have the sump plate sender, but the VDO gauge is reading (what I consider

&gt;length?

I think the oil real way to test it is (next oil change) to put the sender in some canola oil on the stove top hooked up to the gauge and compare it to another accurate thermometer.

I believe some cases do not have a necessary internal cutout in the case to allow the higher temperature oil in the sump to get near the sender. See the rough cut hole &quot;behind&quot; the dipstick?
