Subject: Re: [T2] Tranny Again

Me again. sorry to dwell here. I did a quick search and found this little piece at
Aircooled_dot_net. Is this the short shifter you speak of?

Quick Shift Kit

        Price: $ 6.95
        Part #: CFS0002
        It's hard to believe a product this inexpensive can work this well! Shortens shifter
        throw 40%. Includes all hardware.
        If you have a sloppy shifter, this is NOT the solution. This amplifies shifter
travel,
        and if you install it in a car with worn out components, it will amplify your
shifting
        problems too! Replace the shift coupler and bushing(s) if you have shifting
        problems.

&gt; Another option is to have a friend work the shifter back and forth while
&gt; you crawl around under the bus. That should help you find everything.
&gt;
&gt; A short shift shifter doe not shorten the length of the handle you use to
&gt; change gears, but instead shortens the length of the travel - the distance
&gt; that you have to move it for each gear change.
&gt;
&gt; Don't worry, I made that mistake too once.
&gt;
&gt; Ciao!
