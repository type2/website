More on China Cat. This is really tough. We decided not to split the cases, 
as all the rods and bearings looked and measured so good, and the PO has 
rebuilt the engine less than 5K before he stopped using her. Well, he screwed 
up the heads, so I don't know why it didn't occur to me that he may have done 
other unmentionable things.

One thing I did not do while the P&amp;Cs were off is to check the crankshaft end 
float. We've now done a very careful job of assembling the upper end and when 
we were barring the engine over to set the valve clearance, Bryce said, &quot;Why 
is the crankshaft moving in and out 1/8&quot; when you reverse direction on the 
bar?&quot; 

Well, a loud &quot;clank&quot; had penetrated my skull while doing that, but I hadn't 
stopped to see what it was. Get a prybar behind those nuts and Lo and Behold, 
the crank is LOOSE!!! Get out the depth mic. Yup, .086&quot;, 2.2mm end float.

Folks, I know this means that we have to undo all the work so far, but can 
anyone tell me what I can expect when I get in there? This sounds like WAY 
too much to be simply wear on the thrust bearing.
