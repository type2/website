Subject: Unknown knob on '69 westy dash

I have a control of some sort on the dash of my '69 campmobile
that I was wondering about.  It is left of the ignition switch and it's
the first control closest to the driver's door.  It is missing a knob
so there is no hint at what it is for.  It appears to move in and out
about half an inch and I don't think it turns.  Also, while I am on the
subject......why does my bus have two ignition keys?  There is
one on the dash and one on the steering column.  As this wonderful
ride is ......well.....not running right now....I don't know if both
actually
do anything or not.  Thanks for any clues.
