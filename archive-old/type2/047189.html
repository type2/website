&gt; Hi Volks,
&gt; 
&gt; I don't ask for help too often for The Mothership but this morning my clutch
&gt; cable broke.  I have never had to replace this part and need the wisdom of
&gt; the list in doing so.
&gt; 
&gt; If there are any tricks and tips you can offer please e mail me with them.
&gt; 
&gt; My local parts store is having one shipped in, so it should be here in the
&gt; morning.  

After you make sure that you got the right cable, be sure to order another
one for the parts box.  Very nice to have one there when the old one
breaks!  I had a broken throttle cable in Elko NV that would have been a
multi-day experience but for the fact that I had carried a spare around in
the parts box for years.  INstead, it was a 1-hour job and up the road we
went!

Where is the cable broken?  if the break is at the clutch lever so that
you can see it, use the opportunity to run a wire or string through the
housing with which to pull the new cable through.  I find that nylon mason
line works well.

If broken off inside the housing, all you can do is pull out the remains
and push the new cable through.  Apply lots of grease as the cable is
going in.

Inspect the hole and clevis pin at the front of the cable.  If the clevis
pin is worn or the hole is egged out, now's the time to replace or repair.
I welded up the egged-out hole in mine and replaced the pin with a
shoulder screw (didn't have a replacement pin, and the 6mm shoulder screw
was a perfect fit!)

Grease everything that moves.  Check the throttle linkage while you're
under there!
