Subject: Re: [T2] oil filler tube  grommet

on 7/28/03 11:17, Chris Mills related:

&gt;&gt; has anyone come up with some magic replacement for the NLA rubber grommet
&gt;&gt; that goes around the oil filler tube on a type IV?


i have modified a VW grommet to make a replacement part.

i purchased a grommet from the VW dealer, part number 021 119 337, this is
the grommet that goes in the hole for the right side hot air pipe. it is an
oblong shape. i cut the straight parts of the grommet away and put the two
curved ends together, so the remaining grommet is a circle split into two
pieces. it fits very well, and the halves don't seem to want to came apart,
as they are captive on the tin. one could glue the two pieces together, but
it doesn't seem to necessary.
