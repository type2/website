Subject: Re: [T2] Westy Tent zipper fixes?

Hey,
My tent is at an Amish canvas shop as we speak.  He is replacing the entire
screen and zipper, patching a few small holes on the floor, and touching up
the rain gutter vinyl attachment thingy.   $40  They are great craftsman, so
I expect a wonderful job.

Subject: [T2] Westy Tent zipper fixes?


&gt; Hi,
&gt;
&gt; I need to affect some repairs to the Westy Side tent. The subject
&gt; tent is the Standard orange and blue 68 to 79 tent. I believe this
&gt; one to be form 1973. Several of the zippers are broken i.e. the
&gt; zipper got stuck and off track. I think I can fix that but I will
&gt; gladly accept any advice on the matter. I am also missing the pull
&gt; part of one of the zippers( the handle and the thing that locks the
&gt; teeth of the zipper together) for the part that goes next to the bus.
&gt; I was missing when I got the tent and never really worried about it
&gt; but I might have need of closing the tent off.  Is this a standard
&gt; part(not even sure what the pull part is called.) Any one have a
&gt; source for them or a spare they would like to donate to the cause?
&gt;
&gt; Thanks
&gt; Chris
