Steve and others

When putting all the tin back on my 81 Calif. Ed Westy, I noticed that
the tin on the Cat.  convert side doesn't totally seal up the cylinder
area like the other side does - wonder if I am missing a piece - I have
the piece that goes under cal. only exhaust pipe - it just that a
triangle shaped opening towards the outside of the motor looks like it
coud use some tin. Your thoughts / obsevations if you got them
