Subject: Bay Sheet Metal (was: Engine Hatch Hinges)

&gt;His catalogue is online.  Just point the browser to www.ahschofield.co_dot_uk

Perused this one for the hell of it as I was interested if they sold
sheetmetal,
of which they have an astounding selection and I saw exactly what I was
suspicios of.  YOU CAN BUY A WINDSHIELD REPAIR PANEL IN ENGLAND.
Sorry to shout but I find this amazing, I'd noticed recently RMMW has been
getting a lot of interesting bay sheetmetal not seen before but it is simply
astounding what is available over there, particularly the darn windshield
frame
repair piece for 25 pounds, what like $50 or so?  And full rear corners and a
whole bunch of other neat stuff.  And how about NEW CORRAGATED PAPER
HEATER TUBES, yeah that one needs yelled about too.

Check it out, maybe we should consider group ordering some of this stuff
if US vendors don't want to make it available.  Why the heck isn't this stuff
coming over here?
