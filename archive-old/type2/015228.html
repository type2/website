Subject: webber &amp; 009
Mime-Version: 1.0

The webber progressive I installed 3 weeks ago in my 74 westy had an idle
jet included in the kit to adjust for the &quot;lag&quot;.  I never noticed any lag
in my 75 bus, or the 79, for that matter (same setup).  I think the extra
jet was a 70, which is swapped with the 55 in the secondary idle holder,
then the 60 pimary idle jet &amp; holder is put in the secondary, and the 70 in
the primary.  Any way, I find all this a lot easier than blowing out idle
jets every day or so on the beautiful fancy really spiffy looking dual
dellortos that were on the vehicle previously.

I have never had an iceing problem, yet.

Some day I would love to ride in one of these &quot;performance&quot; busses, so I
can see what I'm missing.

other &quot;incorrect&quot; stuff on my daily driving POS:  tires, 009 dist., leaks
oil, no thermostat (has flaps).  After reading the list for 2 years, I'm
amazed my vehicles run at all.

I imagine quite a few folks are running webber progressives and 009s who
are satisfied, but would rather not post to the list.
