Or you could use a saber saw with metal cutting blades.;&gt;)

&gt; I believe that a Sawzall  ( sp? )  is the best.   It might be hard to use in
&gt; tight spots, but with a metal blade, you can make nice even cuts, even
&gt; curved  ones.   They aren't all that cheap though.   I think that Sawzall is
&gt; a brand name, and though there  may be other brands  out there, this is also
&gt; used as the generic term. ( like Xerox)
&gt; Anyone agree/disagree?

&gt; Hi folks,
&gt; 
&gt; I'm about to cut a hole in my bus &lt;shudder--cringe&gt; for some recirculating
&gt; air duct for my gas heater.  I have to make some curved and straight cuts
&gt; and I'd like to do this as neatly as possible.  What is the best 110v tool
&gt; (no air compressor) to cut sheetmetal cleanly?  Would a Dremmel tool work on
&gt; sheetmetal or is that used for thinner/softer metals?  I've seen air
&gt; nibblers that look like they can cut a nice curve, but haven't chanced into
&gt; any electric nibblers--do these exist?
&gt; 
&gt; I could just use the drill/metal hand saw/grinder method for this, but I see
&gt; metal cutting in my future.  When I look through the Harbor Freight and
&gt; other tool catalogs it's difficult to tell by looking at the pictures and
&gt; the short descriptions which electric tool would be the ideal buy for auto
&gt; sheetmetal cutting.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks,
