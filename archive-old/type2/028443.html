Hi Rick,

I'm glad your Bus is healthy and running great.  No doubt the T4 engine is a
beast right out of the box.

On racing for pinks, naaaaa. I know how much you love your baby and it'd be
plain mean for me to take her.  The list would get *real* quiet for a while
too and we wouldn't want that!

The engine and bus did great, never really got hot and had good power,
considering the load it was pulling and carrying.  Type 4 engines are built
to last, of course as with any engine, there will be a bad one now and then.

If any of you know Charlie Ford and his bus the Mother Ship, he has over
200,000 on his engine and it has yet to have a valve job!

So Steve, this engine has already stood the test of time and is still giving
me miles of smiles!!  But it would still be fun to race!!  Just name the
time and place buddy, are we racing for pink slips?
