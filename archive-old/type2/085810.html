Subject: Re: [T2] timing light

Richard
If its the $69.99 81zz1515w I have had two. The first one got zapped from a 
bad spark plug lead. It is small. The lamp is not too bright. It shows 
advance and two tach ranges. Its not Snap On but I am happy with mine.

&gt;
&gt;Can someone recommend a good timing light that also does RPM and dwell?  I
&gt;found one at JC Whitney but don't know anything about it.  I was going to
&gt;get a multi-meter and a timing light until I found this combination 
&gt;existed.
