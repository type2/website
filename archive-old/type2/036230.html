For those of you out there with Palm Pilots,
a really neat auto tracking program can be found at:
http://www.zorglub_dot_com/highway/highway.html

Allows me to track all my various vehicles as to costs of operation, 
miles per gallon, etc.

Pretty neat program to have in the Palm Pilot when I am on the road in 
Casper and want to see how he is doing.
