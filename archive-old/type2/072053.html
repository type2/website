Hey, call your local vocational or high school that has welding, that's
what teachers are for!!  They should be able to steer you toward some good
information, or night classes (even better).


&gt;Now that the cutting is finished, the next step is to weld it together. We
&gt;have a small arc-welder with a gas bottle...  but none of us have any
&gt;experience with it. If anyone knows of a good how-to video or web-page where
&gt;I can research the technique, I'd be happy to hear from them.
