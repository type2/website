Subject: RE:Steering Column Flange

Hi There,
I normally chill on the digest, but I just fixed this exact same
problem. On mine it was the linkage from the steering box back to the
beam. Everything seemed pretty tight at first, but with a bit of a pull,
the link tie rod end would pop (or &quot;click&quot;) and then had an enormous
amount of play. My bus was almost undrivable becase it wandered so much,
It had almost 30 degree's of play on the wheel before the steering
acivated. Now, with that one link and ends replaced the difference is
collosal. I'd say this is worth a second, more violent check. Remember
how heavy your bus is on those joints. It may not appear with a mere
mortal trying to wiggle them, but the force of your bus could do it. I
thin a new lnk with ends runs about $20 canadian. Eh.

My thoughts,
Adam

I've been having a bear of a time trying to get my steering and front =
end of my '70 Westy proper.  Presently I am getting another rebuilt =
steering box hoping that it will solve the problem but I'm not that =
hopeful.  Other than not having secure tracking in my steering (it tends
=
to wander/float more than it should) I have about a 3 inch play then a =

&quot;click&quot; when I turn the steering wheel.  The first rebuilt steering box
=
didn't change a thing after numerous adjustments according to the books.
=
 I sent it back and another is on its way.  In the meantime I was loaned
=
a used box which got rid of the &quot;click&quot; but not the play or the floating
=
of the front end. =20
So I think the &quot;click&quot; is from the flange for the steering column if it
=
is slipping.  It is missing the fluting on the inside that contacts the
=
fluted shaft of the steering box and so it doesn't  grab properly.   It
=
was reamed out for some reason.  The big question today is - Does any =
one know where I can get one of these steering column flanges? =20
I have only heard from one source and they want $25.  That sounds a =
little steep!  Also any suggestions for the play in the steering wheel =

or for the floating would be appreciated.  Since I bought the Westy I =
put in new ball joints, shocks, tires (Kumho D rated 185R14 - max load =

1874), and everything is tight when I try to wiggle the front end - =
please no jokes I'm reeeeeaaaaalllly frustrated.  No one in the last =
year and a half has been able to figure this out.  Yes, I have been =
working on it that long when time and parts availability permit.  I =
bought this to fix up and take my 8 year old grandson camping but at =
this rate it may only be ready for a great grandson/daughter.
