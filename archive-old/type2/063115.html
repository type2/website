Subject: Paint codes

Another day went by and all I've got done was ask stupid questions. So here
is one for you-all. My bodyman called today and was exasperated about not
finding the paint code for my van. He claims it's no where to be found. I
don't have the time to look for myself. My question is -is it on the vin
plate behind the front seat? The plate reads as follows....

        2312074171

        type 23-517

        12      074     171

        518  697

        523337          A02  P32

                507517

        45  1  7255  UV 2310  21

Any anybody could point me in the right direction by e-mail-ling me direct
can help save alot of time.

Thanks...
