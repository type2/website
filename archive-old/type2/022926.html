Subject: 71 bus hard on gas and no power
Mime-Version: 1.0

I have a 71 bus with 1776 motor in it. It has a single carb but two barrel 
also with a 009 dist.full mechanical  I just got the bus so I am unsure 
what the proper settings should be, does any one else have this set up. It 
also seams to be very hard on gas and has a real dead spot at 50 mph.
