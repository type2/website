Subject: Re: [T2] air/fuel ratios for a 2.0L

Just my input: decel A/F is meaningless. I have tested extensively with a
$2k wideband on many vehicles, it's not uncommon to go to 70:1 during
decelleration. Idle, cruise, and power are what matter. I can not give any
input on these for a T-2, my only experiences are with Carbs or Digifant,
with the Wideband.

&gt; If I were you, I would tune for 12.5 at WOT, 14.7 at cruise and
&gt; decel.  Maybe a bit leaner at decel.  That will give you a pretty good
&gt; compromise for power, emissions and engine life.
