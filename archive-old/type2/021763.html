Subject: What is it with the 009?

Before I go on, Thomas Tarka's post about his 009 is prompting me to
write this, but I'm not insulting him for trying something because I've
done the same.  He's just another of the MANY that keep trying the 009,
which brings me to my next point..

Why is everyone thinking that an 009 is better?  I don't get it,
ESPECIALLY if you already have a vacuum advance distributor.  Let's say
in the worst case scenario where the vacuum advance isn't working, it's
just like an 009 anyways (except for maybe a different centrifugal
advance curve) so you might as well just leave the thing in there.

This email is also sparked from the fact that when I just bought my 78
bus, it was running like crap.  There was no accelleration and it had no
power.  When we went and looked in the engine compartment, what do you
know... there was an 009 stuck on the engine BY THE REBUILDER!

Luckly, the PO had the correct dizzy sitting around and it ran SOOOO
much better and actually had power.  Is there something I don't know
about the 009 or are people just not willing to clean and lube the
breaker plates cuz I'm really curious why people keep trying it..

thanks,
Mike
