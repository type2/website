Subject: Re: [T2] Turn signal switch

&gt;What's goin on? Can I repair it, or am I going to need to replace it? If 
&gt;replacement is necessary, can anyone give me a ballpark figure on the 
&gt;price of a new assembly.

The pivoting part is held together with rivets I believe. Seems like many 
moons ago I drilled out this rivet and cleaned everything while I had the 
steering column apart and then re-greased it using a small diameter bolt 
and nut with Locktite to put it back together.

Hopefully this rivet failed and the plastic did not shatter.

YMMV.
