Subject: [T2] Re: E Brake Fixed

FWIW, I drove my old '76 Westy for 2 years with a nylock nut/bolt holding the ebrake lever to the shoe, never had a problem. When the pin/horseshoe clip became available, I replaced the nut/bolt with with the pin/clip, which came apart within a couple of weeks.     Jeff S.
