&gt; Add a bike rack to the spare tire and you add a considerable load that is

&gt; fasteners and push inward on the lower portion of the mount, forces for
&gt; which the bracket wasn't designed. If the upper

Yes. I considered these things too. The bike rack in question was pretty
short (maybe 15&quot;), apparently made for one bicycle only.

I have often (carefully) stood atop my spare tire while loading my luggage
rack. I weigh nearly 200# and I have yet to cause any noticeable
deformation of the nose of my bus. I'm not sure, but I think I'd feel
pretty safe with a 30# bike up there.

The other kind of front mounting bike racks I have seen are the upside
down U-shaped things that are attached to the bumper for extra support.
Probably better distribution of the load. But I've never seen one of these
that also allowed to you keep your front mounted tire in place.

You actual mileage may vary. I'm merely describing something that I
thought looked elegant and functional.
