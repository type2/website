&gt;i think i've seen the pump.  one of my wife's uncles runs a car 
&gt;dealership and recently acquired an almost mint one owner 55000 
&gt;original miles beautiful green-yellow with green plaid interior 
&gt;and the original radio with 8-track player 1974 camper.  he wanted 
&gt;$4995 and sold it very quickly.  included was a small spare that 
&gt;fit under the sink and a compressor that ran off a cigarette 
&gt;lighter.  it was all original.  am i right or crazy?
&gt;

You're right.  Only the '74 and '75 Westfalias had an interior 
layout that did not provide interior space for a full-sized spare.  
Instead, they came with a collapsable mini-spare.  A cigarette 
lighter powered compressor was an available option.  A friend of 
mine bought such a compressor from Vanagon list member Martin 
Barrett, who saved it when he sold his '74 Westy.  It is made by 
Coleman and carries both the VW and Coleman logos.
