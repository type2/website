Subject: Re: [T2] Stuck valves and promises

I have swapped back and forth between stock vac dizzy and 009 while 
in the driveway and on the side of the road. First lesson I learned 
it the distributor caps are different. The part of the cap that 
situates the cap correctly on the dizzy is 180 degrees different from 
the stock cap. The presumes that you have the correct caps for the 
dizzies.

I do not recall reading if you swapped the caps or at least turned 
the one in situ around 180 by swapping the wires. I hope this low 
tech issue is the source of your trouble and not something more 
sinister. I am not sure what you could  do to get the diz drive gear 
up, out and back in 180 by swapping dizzies.

Make sure your dizzy is completely seated. When it is the rotor will 
not turn. I have run across situations where a tweaked dizzy clamp 
will keep the dizzy from going down all the way and locking into 
place. You think it is in but when the motor fires up it jumps.

Take a moment and consider firing order : 1-4-3-2. 1 occurs when the 
rotor is pointing strat out of the back of the bus- you can consider 
this 6 o'clock. Look at the pulley and the zero degree top dead 
center mark should line up with the split in the engine case. Look at 
the rim of your stock dizzy and there should be a line filed (cast) 
into it. Turn the dizzy so the line is directly under the middle of 
the rotor.

One more quick check-rotor pointed out of the bus toward you, pulley 
mark at 0 TDC, mark on dizzy lined up with rotor.  If your turn the 
motor 180 degrees clockwise then the rotor will spin 90 degrees 
clockwise and point roughly 9 o'clock. The dizzy is now ready to fire 
#4. Turn the motor another 180 and #3 fires at midnight. A final 180 
and #2 fires. another 180 and we are back to #1.

Turning the motor counterclockwise the sequence is 1 2 3 4. This is 
the accepted order for setting valves. If you elect to insert 
something into the cylinder to double check for TDC make sure it is 
not a crappy pencil that will brake in half and waste several hours 
of your time to remove it :) Later model buses(72-79) dizzy have the 
vac can on the wrong side and will only fit in 180 degrees off. Check 
the Bentley to see if you have the correct dizzy.


Good luck
Chris
67 bus

Check you wires and make sure they go in the right direction.

&gt;so, I managed to free the valves (followup on that in a second), but
&gt;the engine is still running 180 degrees out!

&gt;scenario:  71 bus, 1600DP, vacuum advance dizzy (popped it back in 
&gt;as I figured
&gt;							out the issue with it)
