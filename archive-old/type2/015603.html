&gt;(leaks) but my BIG question (for now) is... how does the engine mount on a 
&gt;benchtop engine stand?
&gt;
&gt;Which two of the four engine studs/bolts go into this? the tops? the 
&gt;bottoms? one top and one bottom on a side?

Bolt up the left case half or right case half, that's one upper and one
lower bolt. I like to use the side without the starter. That way I can
install a partial bell housing with starter mount so I can do some bench
testing if I want.
&gt;
&gt;And I guess I need to find my own bolts/nuts for this?

Yeah.

&gt;There is caked oil all over the engine block under where the clutch is. So 
&gt;this, combined with the oil I found in the tranny should mean the main 
&gt;(flywheel?) seal needs replacing, right????

Indeed. You will need the seal installing tool. Not very spendy and
essential, although sometimes you can just push them home with your fingers
if your lucky and very careful. Do spend the extra few bucks for the higher
quality Viton/Silicon seal. Be sure to clean the seal surface. Don't worry
if a groove is worn into the surface. Normally it's not a problem. Be sure
to measure the crankshaft end play before you pull the flywheel. You can
then adjust that back to spec with a new shim if required.

Get Bentley if you don't already have it. Best money the DIY'er can spend.
