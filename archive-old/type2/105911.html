Subject: Re: [T2] RE: Bus speakers...

Ordinarily I wouldn't recommend much that Radio Shack has to offer...
But... Their Linaeum speakers are on sale for 50 bucks apiece. 8 ohm,
though, but if you've got the juice to run 'em in your Bus, they are a
really sweet sounding speaker...Equal to or better than many at hun-
dreds more... ;-)
