Subject: Engine Oil Removal

OK, I have finally added too much oil to my '72 engine.  I guess about 1.5 
quarts too much.  All the oil is fresh and clean and new.

Opinions sought: could I remove some of the oil through my oil filler tube 
by slipping a tube down there and siphoning out some of the oil??

I really don't want to try to drain the oil again.  It is sitting on a 
dolly, and I would have to 'lift' the engine another 8 inches to get below 
it.
