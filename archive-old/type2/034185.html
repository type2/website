Subject: 1981 &quot;Hippie&quot; Bus For Sale

After much deliberation, we have decided to part with the l971 Campbus that
our son has &quot;hippiefied&quot;.  The engine has been rebuilt with only several
hundred miles put on it since then and the manual transmission is in great
shape.  I plan on keeping my 1981 Vanagon (&quot;Happy&quot;) so we'll still have a VW
in the drive.   If anyone is interested in this bus, check out the webpage
and check it out!
