Subject: RE: Our secret shame

&gt;With all these gigantic SUVs and trucks I haven't parked next to a car
&gt;in 3 months where the hood was lower then my door :v)

I have not yet gouged someone's hood or trunk, I try to be careful 
about that. But I have been a little more observant about the subject 
since the thread first started and I noticed that I almost always 
back into a perpendicular parking slot. The main reason is so that I 
can pull out easier and safer, but it also usually puts the bottom of 
my door well clear of a potential gouge as the other vehicles are 
usually farther into the parking spot.
