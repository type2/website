Subject: westy poptop url?

I seem to remember a site(maybe) where someone documented every step of their 
install of new westy canvas. Anyone now what the site is?  Right now I have 
my entire poptop off and new tent ready to go in, but would like some 
pictures to help me through.  
Also, Is there anything in the install process that I could do now while the 
top is removed from vehicle?  I'm just waiting for the first nice weekend, 
but want to make sure I don't mess this up.  I've kind of liked driving 
around as a sunroof van for the last few months anyway
