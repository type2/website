X-Diagnostic: MESSAGE MAY NOT BE TOPICAL

I had a Bus that I needed to get re-keyed, it only cost me $15 to get a key
made, I think is was $20 for redoing the lock. BTW these locking latches are
all over in the Junk yards and I think Bus Depot sells new ones.

-
Can I get it re-keyed to my current locks?
Yes, I am certain that you can.  It is likely to be pricy, unless you do
it yourself.  The process is fairly simple (Nikki even taught *me* to do
it :-), but the problem is that you have to get the cylinder out first.
