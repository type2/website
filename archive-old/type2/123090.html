Subject: Re: [T2] ECU :What is the Difference?

&gt; So here is my senario. I have a '77 Westfalia Deluxe, AUTOMATIC TRANS. I 
&gt; want to replace the aftermarket carb. with FI. In regards to year and type 
&gt; of transmission how compatible are the different year/transmission types. I 
&gt; am looking at a system from a '78 with a manual tranny.
&gt; 
&gt; Questions:
&gt; 1. Will this FI system work on my bus?

yes

&gt; 2. Will the majority of it work, minus the ECU?

the correct ECU will make it marginally better but it will work with that
ECU, let me check I may have the correct ECU here

&gt; 3. Am I just going about it the wrong way and should stick to finding the 
&gt; exact year and type tranny?

always better but sometimes you have to take what you can get
