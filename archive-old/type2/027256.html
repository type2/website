                    My '78 Bus Needs A Good Home


	 I purchased the bus from a gentleman in San Diego in Nov. of 99, I am the 
3rd registered owner. I have driven the bus ( that I call &quot;warhorse&quot;) from 
San Diego, to Tulsa OK. and back with no problems at all, didn't even have 
to top off the oil (which has been changed every 3000 miles, by myself and 
both past owners).

  the sunroof needs to be replaced, but all the hardware is good( crank, 
cables, etc.) and replacement roof panels are available.
  she also has a small rust through area, below the windsheild on the 
passengers side, that needs to be repaired. but as a whole, she is in great 
condition, and is over 80% original, the only things that have been done 
are, replaced the insulation board in the front of the cab area, and she has 
new rubber mats throughout.

   I have pictures posted on the web at;

          http://www.geocities_dot_com/type2luver/78bus4sale.html

   I am located in Newport, OR. on the central coast, have only been here 5 
months, so there hasn't been time for the dreaded coast cancer to set in.


                thanx.

              M. Holland.
