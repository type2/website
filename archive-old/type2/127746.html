Subject: re: bedliner in eng cmptmnt

&quot;cleanliness issues aside...would something like this
actually make your 
engine area hotter by retaining some of the heat
inside the compartment?&quot;

-- A good question.. I dont think that radiant heat
loss
is a very large % of the cooling. The volume of air
passing through the engine compartment and engine
shroud is what is doing 99% of the cooling. IMHO
this(bedliner) wouldnt have a significant impact on
overall operating temps..
The only way to be sure is to check the before and afters.

Sometimes the light's all shinin' on me;
Other times I can barely see.
Lately it occurs to me What a long, strange trip it's been.
