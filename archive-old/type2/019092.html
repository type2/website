Subject: Dist. Swap Question???
Message-ID: &lt;381A0BD6.53CB_at_earthlink_dot_net&gt;

I went to adj the dwell on the 1800 in my '74 Westy the other week and
ended up finding that the points set screw was stripped at the plate. 
So, I either drill it out and tap it a larger size, or grab the dist.
off of a 1700 that I had laying around.
	Well I slapped the dist from the 1700 in, set the dwell, then the
timming at 10 ATDC, per the timing specs for a 1800.  Well it's been
more tempramental than usual ever since.  I decided to time it at 5
ATDC, per the timing specs for a 1700.  It's been running a little
better (Less hesitation and backfiring) I just need some reasurance that
I'm timing it corectly.  I know how important timing is to our aircooled
engines.
	
	Basically I need to know if you have a 1800 with a 1700 dist, if you
time it like a 1700 since your using a 1700 dist.?

Thanks a lot,
