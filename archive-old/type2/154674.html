Phil,

Thankfully I didn't wire the Compufire backward (which would have made
immediate sense). HOWEVER it turns out the coil may have the wrong allowable
Ohm resistance. The Compufire requires no less than 2 Ohms to function or it
will burn out. I am using a stock Bosch Black coil that I suspect doesn't
have the correct internal resistor, but I didn't have the equipment to check
it. I should have thrown on my external resistor from my MSD Blaster II coil
instead of crossing my fingers. Better yet I should have had John at ACN
send me a new coil that would work. Sigh...

I am going to try the Compufire in a different dizzy with a different coil
just to see if it is really toast, which I hope is not the case. Those
buggers are expensive. If it is done for, I think I'll try out the Hot Spark
unit.

I'm going to fire it in a few minutes with the points installed and start
swapping parts if that doesn't work. If that doesn't work, then I will use a
bigger hammer :)

I'll let y'all know.

Jon

Sorry, re-read, and I seen &quot;compufire&quot; and my mind farted and seen
&quot;computer&quot;. but unless you put the wires on the coil backwards your
compufire ignition should be alright, but installed backwards will cook it.
If in doubt put the points and condenser back, and use them to start the
engine then go back to the
electronic set up.   Phil

Sorry about the fried compufire, all it takes is a
touch backwards and they are toast. Phil
