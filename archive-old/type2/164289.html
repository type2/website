Subject: turn signal or wiper motor 71 bus

I am looking for a turn signal switch assembly and wiper motor for a 71 bus.

Does anybody know where I can get these? I had ordered the wiper motor from
Bus Depot but it is on backorder for unknown ETA.

 

On the turn signal - I would also be open to paying someone to rebuild mine
(or simply check all wires and connections, re-solder if necessary, etc.)

I've replaced it once, but the newer one is also bad. I no longer have time
or energy to try to figure out how to rebuild it myself, and here in New
Orleans there is no one left willing to do this either.

Thanks!

Wink
