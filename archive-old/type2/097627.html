&gt; Why didn't anyone grease those things when the service called for it! Oh
&gt; wait, that was me. My bad.

&gt; So Steve, How hard is this?

&gt; Looking at the Bentley exploded diagram it seems that one could do this

&gt; the housing still on the vehicle.  You seem to imply it's the best way:

Paging Rick Taylor - I recall he has invented a grease tool for this
normally unserviced item.
