Subject: Re: [T2] Sunroof solutions for former poptop campers??

Do Australian buses rust?!!
Does a bear crap in the woods?!
We still have plenty of rain and Sydney is renowned
for it's humidity so yeah.
If you live out in the country you can see cars(no
buses though) out in the fields that hold out a long
time before succumbing and there are surely a lot more
examples of buses that aren't nearly as bad as some
considered ripe for restoration in the US or Europe or
England.
In fact a bus that bad in Australia is often
considered not worth the effort.
You must remember that we pay a lot for parts and
replacement panels and our scene is MUCH smaller.
Check out Kimm Garland's business Indian Automotive
for some examples of Aussie buses:

&gt; Hello mate. Do buses in Australia rust? Or is it a
&gt; nice dry California like
&gt; climate leading to immaculate bodies?
