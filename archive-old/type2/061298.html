Subject: My Engine identified

Just to set the record, I have a 75-76 LHD high-top bay. Looks like a
&quot;Safare`&quot; but with ply cabinates not
Chip board. My Engine is &quot;up-right&quot; with the fan set-up just like the
Bettle &amp; is a VEGA 1600 Dp &amp; runs happily on unleaded or leaded with
009 dizzy.

TTFN :) -lego man!
