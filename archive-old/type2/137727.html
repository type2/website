Definitely for stationary use only. Don't know how that differs from
just popping the hatch, but it could be more convenient.

 Just for the empirical evidence, I used a plumber's smoke bomb wired

 The oil comes out  from under the back of the bus and is deposited
 on the engine hatch and the rear hatch and window...Now, I can't say
 for sure that a pop out hatch window will suck exhaust fumes back
 into the bus, but I might bet a virtual buck that it does... ;-(
