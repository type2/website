Subject: RE: Hella dual battery single relay kit wiring

&gt; Here's what I have:
&gt; 1. 71 Westy 1600 with generator.
&gt; 2. A spare battery from my other winter car, full of juice,
&gt; 3.  The Hella single relay kit for charging auxillary battery.
&gt;
&gt; Here's what I want to know:
&gt; 1.  If I install this relay, where does the electricity come from
&gt; after the first hour when my single battery would normally be
&gt; run down, and how does it travel?
&gt; Do I need to wire a seperate fuse panel for the devices I
&gt; want to run? How would they work when I was driving normally, if
&gt; I have them wired to the aux?
&gt;
&gt; 2.  On the instructions, terminal 87 seems to be the &quot;hot&quot; wire
&gt; coming from
&gt; the new battery.  There are then dotted lines, and an extra line with
&gt; something called a 12/7s socket, and a mention of a single pole plug and
&gt; socket.  This is where I'm getting thrown off.
&gt;
&gt; 3.  I read in the archives that you could use a terminal from the coil to
&gt; energize the relay.  That way it would only be working when the
&gt; engine was actually running. True?

While I have not yet installed one of these in my own van (although I do
plan to), I can give you a basic explanation.  I've sold about 200 of these
to list members, so there should be plenty of people who have installed one
and can advise you on the 12/7s socket question. Basically, the relay
connects the 2 batteries in parallel when the van is running, and separates
them when it is not. This can be accomplished via a trigger either from the
coil or the ignition switch; I'm not sure which one the Hella wiring
instructions are advocating but perhaps it is indeed the coil.  This means
that when the engine is off, all items attached to the aux battery will run
directly from it, and not from the starting battery (so yes, you must wire
your stereo, etc. to the aux battery, preferably via a fuse block which is
available from a car stereo shop or probably even Radio Shack.).  When the
bus is started, the two batteries are in parallel, so the aux battery will
trickle-charge and the accessories will continue to run (off of the
alternator, via the aux battery) even as the aux battery &quot;juices up&quot; again.
The gauge of the wiring to the relay kit is intentionally high because a
thinner wire will result in a trickle charge rather than jolting the aux
battery with a huge (and potentially dangerous) charge when you start the
bus.  A battery engineer from Exide did a great job of explaining how how
the design works on the Vanagon list.  You could search the archives via
vanagon_dot_com.  His name is Beckett Cantrell; I believe you can search the
archives by author.

Incidentally, Beckett's endorsement of the Hella kit on the Vanagon list
resulted in a slew of orders that depleted my stock sooner than I had
expected. I am now backordered on the battery kit for 3 weeks while I await
more from Europe, so any new orders for them as of this week will be shipped
in a few weeks via Priority Mail when they arrive.
