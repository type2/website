Subject: VW Bus Question

Hello,
   I have been looking for a VW Bus for a while and
have decided that I think that there are more
advantages in a later model bus.  Did all of the bay
window buses have sliding doors?  Or could you get
cargo doors?  I like the cargo doors, but it should
not be that big of a deal.  Thanks for the help in
advance. 

Peace,
Tim Hayes
