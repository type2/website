Subject: Ran Too Hot- My mistake

        So I did another dumb thing- learn from me anyway:

        Long story, but I can't control the actual flaps in my heat
exchangers on my '70 single cab. So its been pretty WARM inside unless
I run with the window open. So as I'm going to be taking my pregnant
wife along on a trip for about 50 miles, I decide to stop putting up
with it and do a kludge- if I can't take time to wire the flappers
SHUT, I can at least disconnect the air-blower, right? 
        EXCEPT, I didn't cap the two metal pipes coming out of the 
fan shroud- I just took off the paper tubing that links the fan shroud
and the heat exchanger. I didn't cap off either end of either side.
        Result: Funny exhaust and *hot* smells coming up the heater
duct most of the trip. Ok, should have capped the heat exchanger intakes,
I think.
        Then my brother points out: MOST of the cooling air must have
been going out of the open pipes, not over the cylinders. IN SHORT,
I roasted my engine :(

        Since its hydraulic valves, all I can do is change the oil
and promise to be smarter next time, I think. Bob, Dennis, anyone else
comment? Besides WAY dumb, which I know.

        If I want to drive with the heater disabled, I have to put in two 
freeze-plug-like-gizzies from Bugformance or otherwise block heat-exchanger
feed. Dumb, dumb, dumb.

        Bill
