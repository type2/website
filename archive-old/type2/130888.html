Subject: MPH to RPM for 82 Vanagon

Has anyone ever calculated the RPMs for different speeds and gear 
combinations?  OR is there a formula that someone can point me to?  I'm 
using the stock tire size 185R14s and I don't have a tach.

Also - can someone explain to me what the little red dots are on my 
speedometer.  There is a series (1 dot, 2 dots, three dots) at different 
points on the gage.  Someone told me these are max speeds (redline) in each 
gear and the dots correspond to the gear.  Is this true?

Thanks

Kevin
