Gentlepersons-
                       Friday posting: I'm looking for a copy/original of 
Michael Palin's &quot;Pole to
Pole&quot; last seen around here (NY/NJ), on PBS chan. 13...will pay labor and 
materials if
you have an original to copy.
                       Second search: Again, any closet paranoids have a copy 
of Patrick Mc-
Goohan's series, &quot;The Prisoner&quot;, in there with you? The complete series, 
please. Again,
will pay labor and materials for copy...And yes, I know, I could buy this one 
new, but...
Thanks in advance.
Tony in NJ (W.A.S.T.E.)
