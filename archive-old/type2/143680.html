Subject: Re: [T2] Changing Muffler on 2cc 76 drivetrain

I've never changed it before.  I'm sure the mechanic
put the Cat.Converter back in when I had the new
engine put in. That was the last time the muffler was
changed.  I can see two bolts on the bottom of the
right side. So I figure there is one on top. Again, I
have never changed a muffler on my Rudy bus.  I'm just
trying to get a heads-up to get it fixed right. I'm
ordering from the BusBoys, by the way. They are fast
with UPS to Seattle, 3 days usually.

I'm not much more than a tune-up mechanic.  I usually
save the big stiff for Dan, the man in Seattle.   So,
if it is anything other than tune up parts I'm very
green.  If it's easy then that usually means I'll get
frustrated and find it difficult but not impossible
LOL!  I don't have a garage, just a driveway!  Part of
the reason I can't do major repairs...

Thanks,

Rae

&gt; I need to change the muffler on my bus. It has a OM
&gt; set-up on a 2cc FI drivetrain.  There are bolts on
&gt; the
&gt; top of the tubes/pipes that conect to the muffler. 
&gt; These look very hard to get at with the engine in. 
&gt; Are there any tips or tricks for getting at this
&gt; bolt
&gt; from to of the muffler on an OM set-up??? 
&gt; I can easily get to the bolts on the bottom.  It's
&gt; the
&gt; one on the top that looks like a bear to get to. 
&gt; Should I take off the bumper??  Any ideas??
&gt;

&gt; 
&gt; Not sure what you are referring to. The 75 to 78
&gt; muffler is the easiest to remove.
&gt; All you have is a band on the right side and a
&gt; compression clamp on the left end.
&gt; Here is a pic of it:

&gt; 
&gt; A is the muffler, D is the band, the muffler
&gt; attaches to the end of E or a cat with a compression
&gt; clamp.
