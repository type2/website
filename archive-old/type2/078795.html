Subject: Westphalia&quot; stickers on eBay :-)

Hi Ron, Volks

I don't  think that &quot;Mudpie&quot; is too good at spelling.

A while back someone on the Bus_Life list saw that he had &quot;Volkswagon&quot;
stickers for sale. They sent him an email asking if he had any for a
Chrisler or Shevy. 

The graphic he is showing on the page you listed distinctly shows evidence
of photoshop tampering.

Happy trails,

Greg Potts

&gt; Saw this on eBay; it was definately good for a chuckle (and it is Friday)...

&gt; Windshield Decal Kit VW WESTPHALIA by mudpie

&gt; 
&gt; Yes, the stickers really do say WESTPHALIA.  :-)
&gt; They also come with extra stickers saying HI PERFORMANCE and RACE TEAM ...
&gt; perfect for those of us who drag race our Westies.
&gt; 
&gt; No, The Bus Depot won't be carrying these. :-)
