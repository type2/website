Subject: Re: [T2] 009 distributor? Why not?


On Vacuum Distributors:
I have seen two different kinds, one has the single hose fitting and the 
other has 2 (front and back). My 77 2.0L has the two hose kind, but the 
front hose was disconnected for 4 years and it ran great, i finally got it 
hooked up right, and it runs about the same. I have always wondered what the 
main difference is on the two hose vs. one hose dizzy. Is there an 
advantage? I assume the one hose vac advance pulls more air from the diz 
shaft area.. anyways, food for thought.

&gt; &gt; Not knowing squat about power curves, etc. I hesitate
&gt; &gt; to say this, but I owned a '66 bus, original engine.
&gt; &gt; but it had a 009. I ran it all over the country, never
&gt; &gt; noticed anything amiss. I remember it fondly as the
&gt; &gt; best VW  i ever had.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Now I own a 68 that has the same engine as the 66 and
&gt; &gt; a vacuum advance dist. Runs just as wonderfully as my
&gt;
&gt;the 009 dizzy doesn't work that badly in a type1 engine, it is in 72 when
&gt;the type4 engine started being used in the bus that the 009 dizzy became
&gt;very difficult to use, and with the Fuel Injected engine next to
&gt;impossible to get to even run half assed well.
&gt;
&gt;I had a 009 in my 71 years ago and it was ok.  but my 78  had a newish
&gt;009 in it when I got it.  I phutzed with it and phutzed with it and never
&gt;could get that engine to run right.  finally someone told me to find the
&gt;right dizzy for it.  took some searching but finally found one but the
&gt;difference was unbelievable.
&gt;
&gt;if yours is a type IV engine, take the time and energy to find a decent
&gt;correct vacuum dizzy you won't have wasted your time
