&gt; &gt; I'll weigh in in favor of the Kirkland 195/75R14C - I've got 'em and
&gt; &gt; have been very happy.  Can't beat the price, at least around here.
&gt; 
&gt; The load range C version of the 195/75R14 tire doesn't have the
&gt; load rating (1540 lbs) needed for a bus.  In fact, I was surprised to
&gt; find that
&gt; the load rating is less than the passenger version of the 185R14 size,
&gt; after I got talked by the friendly tire man into thinking that it was
&gt; &quot;exactly the same&quot;!  You need to get the D range if you have to go with
&gt; the 195/75 size.

Hm...  Pulled out the owners manual for some refs...  The 195/17R14's
are rated at 1435...

Much to my surprise - the tire recommended is a 185...  Wider, right? 
Either 6 or 8 ply...  Would the wider tire take it from 1435 to 1540???

Where do you get the 1540?
