&gt; Sorry guys but after months of lurking and searching for a nice

&gt; could either choose a nail of a VW or a very nice mini.  Not really
&gt; any choice in the matter.

Damn, wish I could get a nice Cooper S over here for that money,
at least he's sticking to quirky little cars though a bit faster
than most vintage VW's.
