Subject: RE: [T2] What is the deal with H4 lamps?

&gt;4) What do you think, ....think you could get away with them not being DOT
&gt;approved for regular use?
&gt;-With all the varying lights that all these new cars have, I doubt very
&gt;seriously that you would get nailed during and inspection for having H4s. If
&gt;you did, I would try another inspection station.

Remove and install the OEM style for the inspection and reswap the old for 
the H4's when you get home...

Make sure that they are properly adjusted so that no cops have any reason 
to bite for headlight violations.

DO go for the headlight relays. BIG difference (yellow to white light). 
Total cost is about $25 for 4 relays ($1.99 Parts Express) and some wire.
