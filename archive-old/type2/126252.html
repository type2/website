&gt;I noticed this bar on the 78 engine I picked up that goes from the throttle

&gt;found a picture of it in a blow up of the egr system, but no discription of 
&gt;its purpose.

There is a valve on the plenum and the linkage opens it mid throttle. The valve passes oxygen depleted exhaust gas from the muffler to the valve using a filter and long pipe that goes through the engine tin.

&gt; My 79 looks like it has a place for it, but it isn't actually 
&gt;there.

Federal 79 models should have it I believe.

&gt; Is it bad to not have it?  I don't have the filter or anything that 
&gt;attaches to the other side either(for either of the engines) Will I need to 
&gt;get this?

It does not harm to the engine not to have the systems running. All you have to make sure of is that the valve is blocked off. Of course, if you need to have your bus inspected and they expect to see it, you've got to acquire the rest of the components (filter via Bus Depot, pipe and valve via junkyard) and you need an exhaust system that you can hook the filter up to.
