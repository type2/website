Subject: vacuum advance problem

'71 1600DP stock engine with a dual vacuum advance distributor and 
34PICT-3 carb. I checked the vacuum cannister on the bench. Both the 
advance and the retard diaphragms hold vacuum well.
I also put a vacuum gauge on the intake manifold and got a nice 
steady reading of 17 inches at idle.
And finally, at idle, if I pump on the advance port on the cannister 
with a mityvac, I see the timing advance smoothly. If I pump on the 
retard port, I see the timing retard smoothly.

Now it is time to drive. Driving with both advance and retard ports 
connected to the carb is choppy and there is little power. If I plug 
those ports on the carb and leave the ports on the cannister open to 
atmosphere, the drive is nice and smooth.

I need some help understanding this.
Jack
