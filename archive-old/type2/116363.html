Yah, I just drove over to Berkeley to buy one from the guys at Buslab.  
Turns out the scratch mark on my old scale was at TDC, so would have 
been totally bogus to time it there anyway.

&gt; Verify your distributor part#, because that tells you what to time it

Oh grump.. that means I have to pull it out of there again :-)
