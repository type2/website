Subject: Re: [T2] To New York- Mid Trip Update

Guess I just don't give the Bus enough credit! I've gotta get the new
steering components installed so I can really see what she's made of.
Right now, I don't drive it that much, and when I do, I don't ever go
above 50 miles an hour. I had to replace the steering dampener. With the
old one, the wheels would wiggle back and forth like crazy. I KNOW the
tie rods are COMPLETELY shot, and the balance and alignment is also
totally off. At least with the new dampener, it's driveable to the local
car show.

&gt; Heck I've towed on roads like that. The Type 2 can handle it...

&gt;&gt;I drove to West Virginia taking that road, from I-95 (up from 
&gt;&gt; Florida).
&gt;&gt; the automatic kept down-shifting, I had to brake constantly... it 
&gt;&gt; would
&gt;&gt; be a road better suited for a Pontiac Fiero, or a Porsche or 
&gt;&gt; something.
