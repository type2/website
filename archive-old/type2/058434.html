If you take a close look at one of these pumps you'll see that the motor is 
totally sealed (that's why they're fully submersible), and all that contacts 
the water is the little plastic impeller and the impeller housing/mounting 
base (also plastic).  The housing/base snaps off by depressing the tabs with 
your fingers.

For what it's worth, I've run one of the 350 GPH pumps in a backyard pond 
setup for over 5 years.  The pump runs off a deep cycle battery.  Running the 
pump from dawn to dusk, all year round except for an occasional hard freeze, 
my first pump lasted over 3 years.  Not bad for a $10.00 pump.  A Group 24 
deep cycle battery runs the pump for 4+ days during the Summer before needing 
a recharge.

I have a variety of freshwater critters in this pond complex, including fish, 
and have never had a problem due to water quality.  

I expect any &quot;taste&quot; in your water supply would originate with the plastic 
tank, not the pump.

&gt;&gt;	This is the 2nd time I've heard this recommended.  My only question is 
&quot;what's the difference between bilge water and drinking water?&quot; A lot.  I 
think the price and performance sound great, but is the pump adding anything 
like grease, plastic, etc. to the water?  Does the spec. sheet that came with 
the pump mention &quot;other uses&quot;?  &lt;&lt;
