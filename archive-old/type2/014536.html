I never could get my 2.0 to stop smoking and finally pulled it.  The head
had a hole in the #2 combustion chamber through to the exhaust manifold
stud.  From what I've read, this is pretty common, and the likely cause of
the low compression in that cylinder.  Now it's split and on a table in my
garage.  So I'm trying to do a budget rebuild without going overboard (can
you say 1400 dollar type 1 rebuild?).  The main bearings showed some minor
scuffing, so I'm gonna replace them.  The crank looks OK and I probably
won't go for a regrind.  Is this insane?  I miked the journals and it's
been ground once, and those journals look pretty shiny, except for the
center of the flywheel end main where the oil galley is.  The cylinders had
acceptable compression when I checked them (except for the cooked #2).  I
plan on ordering a gasket kit, head, some pushrod tubes and whatever else
rolls under the workbench from bus depot pretty soon. 
What else should I be looking for while I'm looking at my motor's dark
recesses.  Like does that full gasket kit come with pushrod tube o-rings?
