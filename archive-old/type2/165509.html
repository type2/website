Subject: RE: [T2] Torsion Bar Adjustment

&gt; The Haynes manual talks about using a tyre lever to relieve residual tension

&gt; tool is used to remove tires from wheels.  Anyone had experience with a tyre
&gt; lever or other tools used to relieve the torsion bar tension?

For this application, tire lever = really big screwdriver.

When I did mine there wasn't much tension on it.  I could have lifted it
off the stop with my hand.
