Speis Hecker is excellent paint--BUT--be sure to over reduce it a bit--

Otherwise it has a tendancy to bubble all over---don't ask why--it's
just the nature of the beast.

Two of my buddies bought a cab over Peterbuilt--and they were going to
paint it-- they got 3 gallons of Black Speis for zip--I advise against
it because of the inherent problems with it---they went and layed it on
heavy anyway---
I got another phone call----&quot;what now?&quot;

&quot;Let it set up, sand it all down with 320 and lay two light coats on it
again&quot;---it bubbled again---

Another phone call--&quot;now what&quot;

Ahh--sand it all down--lay a light coat of Vari Prime on it, scuff it
down and go get a gallon of Deltron--and lay a couple of coats of that
on her&quot;

No bubbles.

The trucks payload must have dropped considerably just because of the
weight of the paint on it--and mind you this is a CAB OVER semi I'm
talking about--like aptment # 9--these guys must have liked the absue
big time.

And this is not the first time I have heard horror stories anout Speis
Hecker--

Good long lasting paint--but hell to apply.

I prefer PPG Concept-- a blind, crippled, and crazy man, smoking pot
could get a deep, smooth, long lasting, finish for half the price, and
half the effort.

And if I was painting a car--I would use base / clearcoat---deeper
finish--longer lasting protection against the UV evil stuff--



Good Luck Courtney--

OK Terry, I'll ask for advice. A fellow wants to paint my VW Bug in it's
original color for me (I'm restoring it) in a Speis Heckler paint Single
Stage. What do you think of that paint?? 
Courtney 
If you guys want pro paint advise ask me before you go crazy with some
miracle in a can idea--it may be costlier--but I'll steer you down the
right path--then you can make your own decision on how you want to do
it-- 
Love and kisses, 
TK--

The can pictured on the left is primer for non-ferrous metals. But the
can on the right, zinc rich, says it is for steel. I see no info for
it......

Now I have read more,, 
I hate finding out what I did 10 years ago worked fine, but the mfgr
says not! 
seems the web page states the primer is good on Non ferrous metals!

I guess I shouldn't have painted my ferrous wheels and bumpers with that 
! 
They still look good in my books!
