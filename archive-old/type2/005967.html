&quot;My daughter's loaf just got smashed.  It's really too sad, after all she 
has had to do to get it on the road.  There were the usual emissions 
things, the wiring, the lights, etc.  Finally, 2 months after she bought it 
she was legal and loving her Westy.  What a neat first vehicle for a 19 
year old kid!
She was driving in Fairfax, VA on one of the major roads, trying to make a 
left hand turn across traffic.  The bus stalled and didn't make it across 
before being smacked in the right rear corner.  Smashed the bumper up, too. 
 She was pretty broken up about it.
Thanks to fellow list member Brent Jarvi, she already has the replacement 
metal and a great bumper to fix the bus.  Thanks again, Brent.  Now, the 
problem.  She took the bus to a local body shop for an estimate.  They told 
her 800.00 - 1000.00 to fix it, but that they wouldn't do it.  Maybe 
because it is a self pay job, instead of an insurance one, who knows?  They 
couldn't recommend anyone, either.
Does anyone know of a shop that is more reasonable and that does this sort 
of work?  The bus is drivable, so we could travel a  certain distance to 
the right shop.

Karen &amp; All-
Call Ken at Ace German Auto in Woodbridge, VA. He is topnotch. His rates 
are fair, and his craftsmanship superb. He is proud to show you what he is 
working on, and let you see evidence of his outstanding work. (Ask to see 
his 1957 Ghia). Don't get in a rush, drop the van off and come back when he 
calls.
