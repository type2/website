&gt;&gt; So here's the issue.  Replace brake light fuse, all brake lights work,
including the e-brake lite on dash.  Drive for 300 ft Without Applying The
Brakes!  and the fuse pops.  You can hear it. Have any of you folks seen
this before?  Is there anyone out there who can help?  I know there's a
short somewhere.  Is there something other than brake lights on this circuit
that I don't know about? &lt;&lt;

Rubbed-thin insulation anywhere on the length of the wire to the rear?  If
the circuit shorts (goes to ground before the load, in this case the bulb)
the fuse acts as the load and blows to protect your bus from fire.  So I'd
trace the whole path of the circuit from the bulb to the switch looking for
rubbing paces.  I'd love to replace every millimeter, or at least the long
runs of my camper's wiring someday.  The next plan is to run 1 or 2 gauge
hot and ground wires from the battery to the cab for the stereo and head/fog
light relays.  The ham gear still runs off it's own sealed gel cell under
the jump seat.
