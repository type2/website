Richard,

Yup.  just like a wheel bearing, only bigger :-)  and they should indeed
be cleaned!!!

To clean them, what I do is buy an empty paint can from Home Depot and
half fill it with Kerosene (parafin in Britain)  Pop the joint off the
half shaft and soak the joint (and boot if it is still good![1]) in that
kerosene overnight, then work all the old &quot;stuff&quot; off.  Do one joint at a
time!!!  Mixing the balls within a CV is OK, you don't have to worry about
keeping the same ball in the same groove in the inner and outer races. At
the same time, you are not allowed to mix them between different CVs[2].

To pack them what I do, at least on used joints where it is easy to move
the joint in and out, is to slide the hub onto the half-shaft until the
end is flush with the hub.  Then I lift the outer ring to form a cup in
the center.  Fill that cup with CV grease, put a piece of sheet metal over
the cup (or the palm of my hand if I can't find my sheet) and force the
sheet and outer race down.  This presses the grease into the balls.
Repeat 'til it is solidly greased.  This can be impossible on new joints,
as they can be tight as all get out.  In that case, I just do the best I
can with my hand, cupping it over the end and forcign grease in.

I recently bought a bearing packer, which I believe will work fine, but I
have not done a CV joint since I bought the packer.  I am also not sure I
want to set up a gun specifically for CV grease and you would have to have
a CV grease-only gun, as cross contamination is a problem.

[1] I know you have new boots.  If the old boots are torn, toss 'em.  If
they are good, tho, *do* save them!  Some boots last forever, some die in
months.  There does not seem to be any rhyme nor reason to this and I save
and value &quot;good used&quot; (proven good over 100,000 miles) above &quot;new German&quot;!

[2] I say this as an &quot;article of faith&quot; tho I am not sure it is true.  I
have noticed over the years that different runs of CVs from different
manufacturers/plants have balls that vary substantially in size.  These
differently sized balls obviously cannot be flopped.  At the same time, I
have put a mic on balls from different CVs of the same brand and build
date and they mic within a couple 10,000ths and I cannot imagine at
$60/per they are hand matching balls and races :-)  Still, without a 10
thou mic, the safest way to go is to keep all the parts of one joint
together.
