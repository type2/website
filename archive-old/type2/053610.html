Subject: Follow-up: Cylinder Removing...

I got one off. Thanks, Chris.

Here's what I did: After severely dousing the cylinders in Liquid Wrench
(two cans!) I used a rubber mallet to convince the cylinder to move out a
little ways. Then I whacked it back in--I figured about three rounds of that
would unstick the rings. A little more Liquid Wrench. Then I whacked the
cylinder again to open up a little space between the bottom fin and the
case, put a crowbar against the bottom of the bottom fin, and used the
rubber mallet to beat the cylinder off. The cylinders are hosed anyway, so
what's a little more damage on them going to hurt? Result: cylinder off the
engine, case in good shape, rest of engine soaking in Liquid Wrench until
tomorrow morning.

And Erich stayed on the wall, where he belonged.
