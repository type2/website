Subject: riviera parts needed

Does anyone know where to find camper parts for a '79 Riviera?  I especially 
need the pins that hold the top bunk extension on. Is there a supplier of 
camper parts somewhere?  I've already had two other Riviera owners on another 
list e-mail me looking for parts too.

Here's hoping,
Jacques in Yakima
