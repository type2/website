(Yet another tale of woe, in which Drumboy learns more about his
bus,grovels for a part, gets a broken heart, and keeps a stiff upper lip).

A few weeks ago, while coming home from work, I found that I could
not get into any gear. I solicited some help from the list, and did some
digging of my own in the archive, and figured the problem to be in
either the clutch fork or the pilot bearing. An engine pull was imminent.
We are talking about a 1970 Hardtop Westy.

I decided to tackle some other nagging problems while the engine was out:
smelly fuel filler tube, CV boots, spark plugs, fan shroud inspection,
clutch/flywheel inspection to name a few. I was actually kind of looking
forward to diving into it, it a weird,
having-to-drive-the-Oldsmobile-to-work
sort of way.

The pilot bearing was indeed the culprit, as roller bearings spilled out
upon
yankage of the engine. Plus the transmission input shaft had been shredded.

Looks like I get to see the inside of the differential :^0. That's asking a
lot
of this city-boy.

Input shafts are scarce in this neck of the woods. Does anyone have
a good used one they want to sell? Pleeeeeeease?

Without a shaft, I went to work on the gland nut. I went out and bought
the big iron tools (3/4 slide bar, angle iron), and the gland nut
practically
jumped off. I think I scared it. Flywheel off, pilot bearing dust removed,
case cleaned, new flywheel seal installed. Things are looking up!

Not so fast pardner. Close inspection of the cleaned case reveals two
hairline cracks that are seeping oil ever so slightly. Buzz killed.
000ooo... splat.

My realizable options:
  1) live with it
  2) JB weld, hoping to become a success anecdote, just like on the package

  3) ? (low dough options only)
