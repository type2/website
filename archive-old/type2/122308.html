&gt; Wondering if anybody on the list has encountered this and perhaps has some

&gt; a strange power loss when the engine is cold- not a real hesitation but a
&gt; feeling that your not getting the response from the accelerator pedal you
&gt; expect- think someone is holding your bumper as you accelerate - lasts only
&gt; briefly , maybe a couple minutes and then feels fine again - good accel and
&gt; power no hesitation everything is fine - anybody with any ideas - perhaps it
&gt; is the result of not warming up the bus

Let it warm up a little longer. With the cold-cold fuel enrichment and the
winter temps the fuel is more likely to condense in the intake manifold.
