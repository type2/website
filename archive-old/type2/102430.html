Subject: Bus still not starting

Thanks for all suggestions re. my earlier post about non starting bus - have
tried them all with no success.  Have observed that I have a reasonable spark
when points are flicked, but very weak spark at plugs.  Condenser is new,
leads are new, have tried alternative coil, but still no go.

2.0 air cooled with 34 PDSIT Solexes and mechanical distributor.  All help
gratefully received - does it just hate the cold?

Thanks,

Dave
