Subject: Re: [T2] Cold Idle Issues

[...]

I need a little more info here. Nowhere do you say what year/engine you have.
Where are you getting specs of 7.5 AFTER from?!?
What dizzy do you have?
What book are you using?
Having a 34 pict3 tells me you have a 71 bus. If you don't, then any specs you
are using are worthless. The 71 used a dual vacuum dizzy, one-year-only.
68 - 70 is 0.
71 is 5 after.
72 is 5 after.
73/74 is 10 after.
73 - 75 w/auto trans is 5 after.
75 w/stick is 5 after.
76 - 79 exc 79 Cal is 7.5 BEFORE.
79 Cal is 5 after.
All the engines that time AFTER TDC are dual vacuum unit dizzys with vacuum at
idle on the retard side.


&gt;I recently went through a whole tune up on my bus after installing a vac.
dizzy.  After thoroughly warming the engine up I did the following:
Set timing correctly for the dizzy model and engine (7.5deg atdc)
Set dwell exactly at 50deg
Used Hoovers sermon on carbs to field tune the 34PICT3 and set idle at 950
rpm.
