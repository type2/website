&gt; Do all of you
&gt; know how many owners your Bus had? 

I am the 4th.

&gt;She said that the
&gt; air-cooled engines dont last that long. She asked how
&gt; many engines my Bus has had? 

One.

&gt; Am I nuts? 

It has been my experience that a good number of people actually know these things, but YMMV.
