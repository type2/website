Subject: Re: erratic high beams

Recently, when I am driving at night in my '71 Westy,   the high beams
click on every minute or so.

 Sometimes I can turn them off using the turn signal handle; other times

this doesn't work.

I stumbled on a procedure that does always turns them off, though. There
is
a cable bundle which comes from underneath the dashboard and disappears
into the steering column. Whenever the high beams click on, if I push or

pull on this bundly, the high beams click off.

What triggers the high beams? Is it the application of 12V to a relay?
I've looked at the circuit diagram but have no ideas on why these high
beams suddenly come on or what the role of the cable bundle is in this
malfunction.

Can someone suggest a connection between the cable and my problem?

thanks, Jack


Jack,

There is a connection between the bundle of wires and the high beam.
When you turn on your high beams, a contact is made in the switch and
the signal goes to the dimmer relay via the single brown and white wire
in that bundle of wires, this signal activates a switch in the relay for
your highbeams.  If you remove the 2 screws that hold the turn signal
switch to the steering column you should be able to pinpoint the
location of the short that is causing the erratic behaviour of your
lights.  The brown and white wire has become loose or is somehow frayed
and is likely shorting out. If you can't see any signs of obvious damage
then perhaps the wire has become loose where it joins to the switch or
at the point where the wire connects to the dimmer relay.
Check these connections and you should find the fault.

If any other list members have comments or alternate diagnoses..please
share.
If you have any questions, please pmail me.
(I hope I'm reading the wiring diagram right ;).  )
