Subject: Parked Bus - blue smoke
Date: Mon, 1 Feb 1999 21:01:29 -0800 

Hi Volks folks:

I'm checking out a '75 camper that sits garaged a fair bit of the year until
warmer weather and the end of the school year kicks in.  The owner cranks it
over a couple of times a month but let it set for 3 months and just turned
it over today and took it for a spin.  He noticed some blue smoke that
quickly dissipated with no noticeable engine sputters or drop in power.

Thoughts or suggestions from the list on what this is related to - something
shrinking when its cold letting some oil through and expanding after it
warms up burning it?  Does this sound fatal?  I had planned on checking it
out through an mechanic inspection to see what's up then buy it if its okay.
I guess my fall back would be to get the inspection and if it did need some
help have the work done.

Thanks
Danny
