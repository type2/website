Subject: Re: [T2] CA smog: we're boned - Advice needed.-Thanks to all.

If you can't find anyone closer, I'm 2 hours north of Sacramento on I-5. I'd 
be glad to look at it for you.

John

&gt; What might help too is if I could show the bus to someone around
Sacramento who could give me advice and assessment on it's general
condition.  Might help.
