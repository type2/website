   Hi Lo, Well I just can't stand being a sniviling lurker anymore.  I am
the proud owner of a very ugly mistreated 72 camper.  I was looking for
transportation about a year and a half ago when a I was informed of my
wife's co-worker's stepson was selling his VW van for $800. It was a dark
and drizzly night when I went to look at it. Took $600 and threw in the
uninstalled tapedeck and a CB.  The windshield was seperating so you had
to drive with your head cocked to look out of a fairly clear spot.  $160
took care of that and is still the only good rubber on it besides the
tires that were only 6 months old.  I spent hours with Bently's wiring
diagrams to get lights and things working.  A dpdt switch on the dash for
the signals.  It still looks like bad spagetti under the dash, but things
work.  The PO removed all the camper interior out, said something about it
looking like somebody was thrying to make a camper out of it.  If he would
have looked at the books he had and the serial number maybe he would have
known that this was not the case. Ah,well.  The paint is horrendous. 
Originally orange, it was very sloppily painted with primer gray.  Didn't
remove the spare on front or tape the windows.  The passenger seat is held
on by the seat belt.  The belt makes a handy place to put books and things
while I'm driving.  I am assuming that the engine is oringinal but it has
a 2 barrel Holly carb and aftermarket foam airfilter. 
        Well, I have'nt done much to it but drive it.  I did have to
rebuild the master cylinder.  I have driven it back and forth between
Pocatello and Twin Falls(120+mi) and Salt Lake City(300+mi) a number of
times.  Mostly this last year has been back and forth to work(5mi round
trip).  She's now taking up my driveway because of can't put off anylonger
promblems. 
        There it is in a nutshell.  Please take me off of the lurker
stats. 
 
with Philos,
