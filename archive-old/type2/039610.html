Subject: Re: Pertronics adjustment

Hmmmm. It sounds a little iffy, but possible. Now that
I think of it, I had to replace my distributor a short
time after that.

I might have to try the Pertronix again, but I no
longer have access to a total advance timing light. I
seem to have lost the little plastic .030 gapping tool
that came with it, too.

Is there a way to check total advance w/out the spendy
little timing light??? I just have the standard strobe
light...no digital readout.

&gt; What you are &quot;seeing&quot; is the removal of the points.
&gt; This also means you have
&gt; removed the points DRAGGING on the distributor's
&gt; rotor, which is coupled to
&gt; the centrifugal advance mechanism.
&gt; 
&gt; In short, your centrifugal advance mechanism is
&gt; sticking, and the points
&gt; used to provide a little drag to return it to
&gt; &quot;zero&quot;, but you have removed
&gt; it with the Pertronix install. Time to tear your
&gt; distributor down and clean
&gt; and lube the advance.
