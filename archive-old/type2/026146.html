There is no way your condensor can get damaged by leaving the ignition on,
unless something very strange is going on.  The points have to be closed to
burn out, but unfortunately this is by far the most likely position for them
to come to rest in, because if they are open, one of the cylinders will be
in compression.

&gt; When you turn your key on, the coil is powered up.  Depending 
&gt; on if your
&gt; points are opened or closed at the time (I can't remember 
&gt; which is the bad
&gt; one, opened or closed) you will burn your points and damage 
&gt; your condensor
