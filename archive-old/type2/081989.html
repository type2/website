Subject: [T2] welding heads

&gt;I have a pair of heads off of my 1700, and it has some funky lloking posts
&gt;sticking out just above the spark plugs, but nothing connected to them or
&gt;around. Can these be pulled out and the holes welded shut, because they are
&gt;leaking air or something. Also are the heads aluminum and has anyone welded
&gt;them before. Tips..

Welding is not possible.
These are EGR ports to the exhaust, and if they are still the original tubes,
then they are threaded into the head past several fins where a tig weld can't go.
They may  be replaced with a 10 X 1.0 X 35 mm bolt, or the tubes can be plugged.
