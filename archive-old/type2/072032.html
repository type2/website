&gt; What size engine do you have?? Did that use to be a truck camper?? Are
&gt;hills your worst enemy?? Let me know. Technically, you can cut any VW bus
&gt;off at that point, and attach a camper to the rear?? If you also have
&gt;water tanks, LPG tanks, grey water/black water holding tanks, how do you
&gt;manage with all that weight??
&gt;I once saw a VW bug with a camper attached. Does anyone know if that was
&gt;made by a company, or custom made by the owner???

In the 70's, Popular Mechanics ran a couple articles on how to build that
camper on the bug pan.  It looked pretty cool, but heavy.

A few years later, if my memory is correct, they also showed how to make a
cool looking bus camper using flat fiberglass and foam panels.  The darn
thing looked like a space shuttler off the star ship enterprise!!
