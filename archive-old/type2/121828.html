Subject: adapting vanagon mudflaps

I always thought Vanagon mudflaps were substantially different from the bay window mudflaps but I was comparing the crappy South American units. When I saw a German pair they look surprisingly similar to the bay window mudflaps except for the side bit that clings to the outside of the body behind the wheel well.

Has anyone tried to cut that bit off and mount it to the bus?  I feel like experimenting with it if anyone else hasn't tried and failed.

The VW logo is there, although it's black and just needs some white paint.
