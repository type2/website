Subject: Re: [T2] Disk Brakes Woes, Please Help...

&gt;is the one way valve on backwards.  you should be able to suck on the
&gt;valve from the engine side but not the booster side.

I don't understand....the brakes were working great after I replaced the 
booster for several months....I don't think anything is backwards.
