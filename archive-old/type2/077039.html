Subject: Re: [T2] oil psi

You're right! I calculated it at 18 PSI for a BAR and the VDO gauge is 5
BAR and not 6 BAR as I stated before. (Well it was raining and I didn't
want to get wet checking it.)
So that gives me........... lets see, pegged out for 10 minutes, a little
over 4 BAR at highway speeds and about 1.5-2  BAR at idle and right on or
above 3 BAR around town at operating temperature of 204 Degrees (that
brings up 100 Celsius = 212 Fahrenheit degrees ?) 
I liked those figures based on 18 psi, you've broken my spirit.

&gt; &gt;If the engine is a recent rebuild or a good engine it can 
&gt; &gt;produce 100 PSI with 20/50 Motor oil at 30 degrees.
&gt; 
&gt; !!That's too high!  I know what the weather is like in Texas and 
&gt; fully agree 
&gt; with the use of 20/50 oil for summer time use.  But you should 
&gt; really switch to 
&gt; something a little lighter for the winter.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;My gauge is 6 BAR (approx 108 PSI) and it stays pegged out 
&gt; &gt;for the first ten minutes, them settles in at 55/65  PSI at 
&gt; &gt;highway speeds, 35/40 PSI normal city driving and 20-25 PSI 
&gt; &gt;at idle of 800/900 RPM.  The same engine can easily run at 
&gt; &gt;60-70 PSI at highway speeds, at 200/250 degrees temp. 
&gt; 
&gt; Ah.  Now I see what's up.  Your conversion for bar to psi is wrong.  
&gt; One bar is 
&gt; approximately equal to 14.5 psi (not the 18 that you are using).  So 
&gt; your 6-bar 
&gt; gauge will measure up to about 87 psi.  What you think is 55-65 is 
&gt; probably 
&gt; more like 44-52 psi and your 35-40 is 28-32.  These are actually 
&gt; very good 
&gt; pressures and are not nearly as scary as what Stan stated.
