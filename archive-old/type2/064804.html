I concur. As a valet parking employee during the mid-80s at an unnamed
Atlantic City casino, I witnessed and/or started more than one fire with
that stuff. No VW fires, though. They were usually GMs for some reason. You
know the ones: they have an air filter cover the size of a sombrero. If you
like driving lots of different kinds of cars, valet parking is of the best
jobs going. New cars, tow trucks, AMC Pacers, Yugos, right-hand drive
Rolls-Royces; you name it, I probably drove it. We also got to test whether
anti-lock brakes _really_ work (I never got to test an air bag, though).
The K-car I was driving when I had the head-on with a casino bus must not
have had one :o.

Ladies, Gentlemen (and the rest of you, too),

Fun is fun, but it's not Friday *yet*!  STARTING FLUID IS VERY DANGEROUS!!
If you spray it around your engine compartment at random, you are setting
yourself up for a closed casket funeral, forget what the bus will look
like.  Starting fluid is composed mostly of Methyl Ether, which has a
flash point just slightly above room temperature.  I would *highly* advise
that you never let anyone near your bus with the stuff.  I have used it,
but only on lawnmowers, V-8's and other open air applications, and then
only with a helper standing by with a fire extinguisher. (BTW, that fire
extinguisher was only for piece of mind, explosions happen way too fast
even for halon)  In the enclosed engine compartment of a bus, you are way
too likely to build an inadvertant fuel/air bomb, which can blow you right
the f*&amp;k away!  DON'T DO THIS!!!!!
