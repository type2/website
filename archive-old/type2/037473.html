Hi,

Anyone have any info on how I can install A/C in my bus? Got info on a
company in California that will send the parts for a bug but will only
install the a/c in the bus if you bring your bus in (for a big pricetag) but
even if I was willing to spend the money (not sure) I live in New York so it
would be a problem to say the least. Any way I could rig up the bug a/c if
that is my only option? Please direct me to some info?

I looked a little at the possibility of installing an RV a/c but they need
120v which would get complicated and plus the ones we saw are enormous.  ?

Sounds dumb to ask for a/c and I wouldn't bother but my asthma forces me to
ask.

Thanks for any help at all,
Jen :-)
