Subject: Re: [T2] Hose for external oil cooler - keeps spliting

[...]
highly recommend the fittings john has mentioned.  Bus engines cold can 
and do hit 80 psi.  cheap rubber will not take that very long and hose 
clamps will leak at that pressure.  the -8 fittings are pricey but i  
consider them worth the cost.

&gt; that's cheap _at_$$ neoprene hose. We have some really good stuff, you

&gt; even need hose clamps if you use our fittings (fittings are about $2ea, 
&gt; hose
&gt; is $2.50/foot). Of course, you could throw down for some Stainless 
&gt; hose, but
&gt; that may be overkill.
&gt;
&gt; We have swivel fittings with -8 ends too, so you can convert to SS hose 
&gt; in
&gt; the future, it also makes removal and re-installation a snap with a 
&gt; wrench,
&gt; instead of fighting those #&amp;*$)#*&amp; hose clamps!
