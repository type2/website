&gt; It seems to me that in cases where two clean flanges come together face 
&gt; to face, and it's possible to reach them with the electrodes of the 
&gt; spot welder, it makes sense to use the spot welder to reduce or 
&gt; eliminate distortion.

Hello Mark   Makes sense to me also thats why I have and use a spot welder in 
places like this makes very quick work also  Later Mark Dearing
