My welding instructor said never to weld
galvanized or cut it with heat -- reason
is poisonous vapor and zinc splatter.  He
said he could do it, but I shouldn't,
but if I had to I should grind off the
zinc and breathe upwind of the weld with
the biggest wind my fans would make.

Consequently, I cut down the galvanized
little silo with a sawzall and deafened
myself instead.
