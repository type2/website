&gt; It's come time for some gauges for the bus. I am planning on oil temp,

&gt; dont have
&gt; to cut the tin. What I cant seem to find is the sump plate for the oil 
&gt; temp
&gt; sender.

FWIW, I've found the sump plate sender reads significantly cooler than 
other senders on my type-1 engine.
Other senders i've used:  dipstick sender and pressure relief valve 
sender.

Also, tapping the sump plate isn't as big a deal as you'd think.  (I 
hemmed and hawed on it for ages then finally just did it and it's been 
fine).

cheers,
