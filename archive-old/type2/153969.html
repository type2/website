I am curious to see if we organize an event here in AZ in the month of July,
how many VWs would show. I am thinking about something like.... 

VWS TAKE OVER THE PAVILLIONS 

As many people know there is a show in Scottsdale every Saturday night, but
with some organization we could overtake the American car scene for one
night. I am not sure how many people we could get from surrounding AZ cities
and states, Nevada, Southern CA, maybe NM? Mexican cars too? Tucson... Dry
Heat Panzars? Anything is possible. 

I think that we could take over the area on a Saturday around 12 noon or so.
This would allow for a good time and hopefully a lot of cars. 

I would like opinions and thoughts. I know that we have the Sonic, but
surrounding states can't really make that show on a Friday night. Please
pass this thread on, I don;t want to post all of this in other forums so
please direct your friends here. And spread the info so maybe we could make
this happen. I am looking for suggestions for dates, July 15? We could add a
cruise on Sunday too. I have another idea too for a show/ swap area, however
I need to research this before announcing the idea. 

Thanks for reading and lets make a desert-hot show happen for all of us die
hards.

Well???  Who's game???  Shall we mention it at the meeting???  If the date
get's confirmed maybe it could make the newsletter for June.  Merri
