Hi Volks,

I believe to remove the mystique/bull of engine
rebuilding you have to ask specific questions.  What
hot idle oil pressure will I get with a Boston Bob
rebuild?  If Boston Bob tells me 7 psi is OK (which he
did). and 7 just barely keeps the VW oil sender light
out, and won't even keep the VDO oil switch off I get
cautious.  Again the simple question that Bob wouldn't
answer was what oil pressure will he guarantees with
his rebuilds.

Now I'm not saying he should guarantee 30 psi HIOP
(hot idle oil pressure), although I believe it is
possible for top level rebuilders to achieve this (ask
Bob of Access Systems about his rebuild).  However if
Boston Bob is such a great rebuilder, he ought to be
able to guarantee at least 15 psi HIOP.  Instead, what
will he guarantee?  Nothing.  Doesn't that make you
wonder?

Rob
