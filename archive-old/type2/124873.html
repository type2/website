Subject: Re: [T2] Charcoal Canister

&gt; On the left are two openings, one about 1cm and one about 3mm.  On the right
 is one about 1cm. From the archives I gather the small one goes to the gas tank.  Since I have
 no current connection for reference where does this small line connect to the
 gas tank?

In each corner vent opening [outside the bus] you will see tubing. These are the gas tank vent lines.
They come from the top of the gas tank and go up each corner. Then each one ends at the center of the top of
the engine compartment near the engine hatch lid. The 68-79 Bentley has an incomplete pic of it; sec 3, page
5. [Missing in the pic is the tee and the canister etc.] Where the 2 lines end is a rubber tee, which over
time falls apart. The tee will have 2 large ends for the tubes and a small end to go the the little nipple on
the cannister.



&gt; Also from the archives I gather one of the larger connection goes to the air
 intake and one to the fan.  Which one goes where?


The large one on the left end of the cannister goes to the left end of the fan housing. You will find a large
nipple sticking out of the left end IF you have the correct fan housing [early ones, i.e. 1700 did not have
it] or if you do not have air conditioning [the compressor stands where the nipple was.....].

The large one on the right end goes to the EEC valve on the front [front is front of bus] of the air cleaner
housing. Bentley; sec.10, page 27, fig 6 - 4.

The little hose on the EEC valve gets tee'd into the ported vacuum line between the front of the throttle
housing and the vacuum advance. When you drive and accelerate and ported vacuum comes in: vacuum advance
starts working and the EEC valve opens. When the EEC valve opens,
venturi vacuum draws the fumes out of the charcoal cannister.

When people take off the FI and put carbs on these buses, this emission system is rendered useless!
