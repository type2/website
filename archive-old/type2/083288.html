Chris,

This is a hard question, since you are correct, tires have changed a lot
since the last bay rolled off the line, but I would still stick with the
manufacturer's recommendation.  the max PSI and load on the side of the
tires is the manufacturer telling you the maximums that the tire will
take, the decal and Bentley tell you what the bus wants.  and you want
your bus to have what it wants, don't you? :-)  Seriously, like timing
gets set to the distributor, not the engine; inflation gets set to the
application, not the tire.

Consider that the same 185R-14 tire will fit a station wagon, a pickup and
a VW bus.  The tire label will not change, but the loads, handling, and
inflation pressure will change drastically depending on application.
