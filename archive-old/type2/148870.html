&gt; I was getting ready to install (in the bus) my own personal 
&gt; remote-controlled, picture size color TV, with matching brass knobs. Came with a handy 
&gt; laminated imitation masonite Wild West gun rack with the look of real wood! The 
&gt; radio is designed for your trans-Atlantic driving pleasure, a fully 
&gt; hallicraftered Sea Master short wave radio in a non-returnable, non-disposable 
&gt; zinc-lined carrying case. You can get Tierra del Fuego, Bucko!
&gt; 
&gt; Any hints on where I should put it? I hate to cut into the dash...
&gt; 
How 'bout right on top of the front mounted spare, so's you can
view it right thru' the windshield...You'll never miss another ep-
isode of &quot;Desperate Housewives&quot; with Teri Hatcher (obligatory
Bus content) again... ;-)
