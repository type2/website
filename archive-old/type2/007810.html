&gt; I have a nomenclature/insurance question: My insurance company
&gt; insists on calling my 1970 a &quot;vanagon.&quot;  I doublechecked at vanagon_dot_com:
&gt; that designation is off by about ten years, isn't it?  What I want to
&gt; know is:

My company calls it a 'station wagon' which I guess is sort of correct
according to VW.
