Subject: Leaking Cover Gasket

Howdy VW Fans,

I got a '78 Transporter and bought from a guy who just never drove it (twice
in the last 8 years). I got her home and found that the both cover gaskets
were dried out and leaking. No problem, take them off clean them and replace
them with new one $5 and a couple of hours. Only problem is it never solved
the problem. My question is has anyone else found that the wire clip that
hold the cover in place doesn't quite hold to good or is it that I didn't
clean them good enough. Thank you muchly.
