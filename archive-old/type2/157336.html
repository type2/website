Subject: Re: [T2] scary situation

Well, I got a new sender and a deep socket.  For those inquiring  minds it takes a 1-1/16.  But I can't get the socket through the  hole around the sender.  Am I going to have to remove the durned  distributor?  Doesn't look like it'll fit through there  anyway.  But I could be wrong.  Nothing simple is ever easy  with vehicles.  Grrrrrrrr....KR
