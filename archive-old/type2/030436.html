Subject: Dashboard removal, was: VIOLATED BUS!!

Ted,

Removing the dash from a bus is not at all hard.  I have done it and you
don't need anything special, other than contortionist skills :-)  Below I
refer to the dash face and the dash panel.  These are two separate and
seperable bits. the dash face is the black plastic foam-filled part that
has the instruments and radio mounted it it.  the dash panel is the flat
black metal piece that runs from the dash face to the windshield.  It has
the defrost vents and speaker grill in it.  OK?

First, obviously, remove the negative terminal from the battery.

Second, remove the instrument cluster (label everything, have a Bently
handy, or pay the price later :-) and the dash-mounted switches, and radio
&gt;from the dash face.

Third, remove the screws from the steering column to dash face and
the parking brake to dash connection.

Fourth, there is a line of nuts on studs at the top of the dash face 
where it joins the dash panel. remove the nuts from the studs, and you
will find that (a) the grab handle above the glove box comes right off and
(b) the studs are mounted in the a separable foam strip that is at the top
of the dash face.  remove that strip of foam.

Fifth, remove the four honkin' big screws at either end of the dash face
and remove the dash face.

&gt; I recall the article well as I used it to replace the dash pad in a beetle.
&gt; The problem is I have never found a source for after-market dash pads for a
&gt; bus. Has anyone ever removed one intact from a donor vehicle?
