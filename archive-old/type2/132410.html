&gt; There is still resistance in the spark plug boots..about 1k ohm I suspect.
&gt; I just measured mine on my bus and got a little less in the 1/3 side and a
&gt; little more in the 2/4 side.  YMMV

The Bosch and Beru plug wires (1-2-3-4) both have 1kohm or 1.4kohm leads.
The observed value depends on the length (the two leads for the rear are
shorter because the tin is closer to the top of the plug).

&gt; That being said I have interchanged Bosch rotor's with 5000 and 1000 ohms and
&gt; not noticed a difference.
&gt; All a little baffling I guess.

Certainly the resistance in the system can change by that amount and the
engine will still fire.

&gt; I meant to reply to this before,, whenever I hear ZERO ohms,, I like to double
&gt; check that is not the infinite end of the scale..
&gt; 
&gt; Too often when there is an open ,, the meter reads infinite but the persons
&gt; states that as ZERO ohms rather than open

That's when a continuity checker that beeps is handy to confirm.
