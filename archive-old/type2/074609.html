Subject: Key Meister

Hello List:

I just wanted to post a little info concerning one of our fellow list members, Steve Sandlin.  We hear from Steve from time to time concerning lock and key issues for our busses, and I sent him a whole set of new locks for my 71 Bus for him to key-alike.  His turn-around time is fantastic, and he takes the time to communicate and follow-up like all service providers should.  He has my highest recommendation, and hopefully all list members will be able to do business with Steve in the future.

Since most posts concerning vendors seem to be negative in nature, I think it's important to also give praise when it's due.

Jim Hood
71 Bohemoth Panel Bus
