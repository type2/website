Subject: Free 70 Westy body in Michigan

HI all, I am giving up my old bus body.  It was a 1970
Westy camper but doesn't have much left with it.  It
has the complete dash, poptop and some window glass. 
What is missing is the engine, tranny, interior and
hubcaps.  I still owe my lawyer $180, so the title is
with him and not me.  The doors are in decent and
rebuildable shape, but the underbody is pretty far
gone.  The last owner had it in a feild for over a
year and you all know what that does to an old VW.  
  If anybody is living in the Ann Arbor area(or not)
and is interested in this bus, let me know.  You will
have to haul it away though.  But free is free.
Thanks.
