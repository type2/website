Subject: Re: [T2] George is broken down in Paradise (Utah), cylinder stud

George:

Give me a call if you get a chance.  801-510-4851 or 801 295-0970. 
Only parts sources are bug craft in Ogden or Bob's VW in West Valley 
City.  I could pick up a stud for you ( if I don't already have one) 
but you need to be more specific which one it is?

Steve Blackham

Centerville, Utah
