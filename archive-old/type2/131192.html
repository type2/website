T-shirt orders will be handled on an advanced order basis.  There will not

this year's shirt will incoperate one of the aerial flyover pics from last

We have a NEW webpage this year.  This is entirly due to the efforts of Rob 
Henly - thanks Rob for all the work on the new site.   Here is the new link 
-
http://www.baywindowbus_dot_com/highcountry8.htm

Full HCBF 8 info/directions ect are available on the website.

I have not gotten the final schedule of events set yet -  that full schedule 
will be posted later.

One Important Event though,  we have finally managed to get Blistered Dawson 
re-booked for HCBF this year.........so get ready for the return of the VW 
FAMILY FEUD!   I will be posting the survey to the list soon the get all of 
the answers for the game.


Starting this year we will no longer be asking for donations to cover extra 
expenses.  There will be a $5 &quot;activity fee&quot; per bus / once for the entire 
weekend.  Overall, this will only add $5 to the total cost of your HCBF 
trip.  This money will be paid at the office when you check in and pay the 
camping fees.

As stated before, I have no desire to make any money off of HCBF.  Any extra 
money out of this activity fund that is not spent on HCBF activities will be 
donated;  split equally between the Type 2 list and the Full Moon Bus Club.


Let me know if you have any questions

thanks,
buddah
