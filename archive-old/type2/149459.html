Subject: If it ain't broke ...

What to do . . .  The '78 is running fine, but it has had bad blowby for the 
past 4 years, and I want to drive it at the speed it wants to go without 
pushing out quarts of oil through the seals

but except for the blowby, it is a 200+k champ!  125, 125, 135, 135 this 
year and 18 months ago 125, 125, 140, 135 .  #3 is a little weaker, but this 
is the compression when it was not a real cold engine like 18 months ago, 
but back from a run around the town.

With spot on timing and 49 dwell, I can take moderate hills at 60 mph.  I 
usually have to brake to keep it at 60 on the I-495, and never drive faster 
than 62 or bye-bye oil....  I haven't checked the vacuum, but I know what 
12&quot; feels like when taking the hills in West Virginia!!  So I imagine I am 
around 15-16&quot;

So, I just took delivery of a new set of P&amp;C from AA performance Products 
(real pretty) and my spare heads are all rebuilt and ready to slap on.

So, do I go ahead and replace the heads and P&amp;C and again see what a solid 
VW bus drives like without blowby, or do I continue to walk the line and say 
thank you for the good fortune I have with this '78.  12 years and 
counting......

Just wanted to share..
