&gt; I agree.  It's just a lot easier to leave it where it is.

I forgot to add that I tested the voltage and I'm getting 14.1 volts at the
battery.  It varies a wee bit when you rev the engine, but it's almost
constant at 13.9-14.1.

And that should have read &quot;New Bus Owner 101a&quot;.  I had a white on orange bay
20 years ago.

BTW, on page118 of this month's National Geographic Magazine there are two
pics of VW's at the Lucas Oil Nationals meet at Darlington International
Dragway in Hartsville, South Carolina.

One pic is of a single Bug racer, the other has 12 Beetles, 2 sand rails,
maybe 2 Ghias, a dragster (rail?), a new Beetle and some sort of wagon I
didn't recognize.
