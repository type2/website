Since there is all this talk about prices of buses.  I am selling my 1976 Bus for $1200.00.  You can see some pictures of it at:

I no longer have the step.  It has a 1600 DP engine in it.  The previous owner cut a hole in the top and added the Westy popup.  Canvas needs replaced.  He also added a Westy interior.  The Westy package is early 70's.  The sink/icebox is not connected and the faucet is all be gone.  I have a rear bumper but it's not on do to having to drill out two broken off bolts.  Located in Northern Indiana.  Email me for more info.
