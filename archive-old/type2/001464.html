I have asked this before, but I now have the benefit of having checked the
archives too

Wiper Switch on a 74 has 3 postions and an off, the first click up is for
single speed, the second for double speed ..correct?

Whats the click down for?

It would appear that on a 78 bus there is an extra postion for intermittent
wipers..is this correct.  And will the wiper switch from a 78 fit a 74 or is
one of those things that goes with the different shaped steering column.

Thanks
