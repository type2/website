Subject: Re: [T2] Mercedes Wheels (Was: Tires)

The early '80's Mercedes 14&quot; bundt wheels do not fit late model Buses
without modification. I have an extra set of wheels from my 1980
Mercedes 300SD that I tried to fit to my '78 Westy, but the lug bolts on
the bus are a larger diameter than the holes in the wheels. You would
need to have the holes bored out some. I haven't tried to enlarge the
holes on mine.
Does anyone know of a good way to do this? You will also need to acquire
some conical lug nuts for alloy wheels, the Mercedes uses bolts.

Thanks,
Doug
