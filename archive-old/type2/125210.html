Subject: RE: [T2] BusDepot Discount

&gt; Sorry, I know its been about a month or two since someone 
&gt; asked this, so I guess its due, has the Bus Depot code 
&gt; changed? I'm ordering my ignition switch and not getting a discount.
&gt;  
&gt; LIST1E right?  Is there a minimum?


Yes, it's list1e. But yes, there's a $50 minimum purchase to get the 5%
discount. (Also, some exclusions: special order or made to order items,
Bargain Bin items, and gift certificates).  Enter the code in the
&quot;referral code&quot; field on checkout.
