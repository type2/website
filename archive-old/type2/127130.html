Subject: RE:Thinking of XM satellite radio

I have had Sirius in my van (not VW but a huge
Dodge(work van))for three years now, and love it. I
went with Sirius because they have the contract with
PRI and NPR, not to mention all the jazz ,bluegrass,
rock, etc..... I average 80,000 miles a year, and
figure that this setup has saved me thousands of
dollars in 'Books on Tape'. Last year I bought a plug
and play receiver for my wife's car, and got a cradle
for my Bus and one for the house. I drive all over the
US and Sonora, Mexico and have no complaints. It is
true though, that in very large cities like New York
or Chicagoland where the building are close together I
will lose reception occasionally or sitting in traffic
under a bridge or in a tunnel. For anyone who has ever
driven across the MidWest or Texas, it's invaluable. I
am going to hook up a cradle in my boat(once I figure
out my wiring problems there). 
They tell you that it only works in the US, but I
regularly take it down to Mexico, seems that the
Satellites don't know that they are supposed to stop
working at the boarder.
....And as for Big Brother being able to track you
through the thing, who knows, it's not like they're
going to tell you. They already can track you through
your cell phone. Most cell phones these days have
built in GPS systems, not for your use, but for
theirs. After all it is &quot;for your safety&quot;.
