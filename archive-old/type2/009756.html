Subject: Riviera pop top seals??
Message-Id: &lt;199906082215.RAA06728_at_pbserver.paulbunyan_dot_net&gt;

I have the straight up &quot;penthouse&quot; pop top and I'm looking for new seals. I
thought they were the same as a Westy but I guess not as I ordered a Flat
Front Seal from the Bus Depot and it's not even close (not the Bus Depots
fault). The ones I have are white and a half &quot; U shape ?? Any one with a
Riviera have a source? Mines a 1977 if it matters.

Also after hitting a deer and smashing in my nose, insurance put on a new
one from the Bus Depot looks great and took care of my only rust that was
under the windshield, new windshield seal too!
