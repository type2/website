Subject: 68 Baywindow Curious About My Numbers

Howdy Folks,

  I finally got around to reading the numbers off of my distributor. 
Please tell me what they indicate in relation to my timing it.  She is
pinging uphill under load.

0 231 170 034

  Is there somewhere I could look up my engine number to find out when it
was built or any other info on it?

  Since my bus still has it's original owner's manuel I found a place
online that makes keys using the key code.  They have the right blank,
which I couldn't find locally or in my catalogs.  Awaiting delivery to
see if it works.  It will be nice to have a key for my locks.  Too bad
the engine and the gas don't lock up, must have been a diferent world
back in '68.

Thank you very much,
Jennifer
