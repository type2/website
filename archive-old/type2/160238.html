Subject: New (to me)1977 7 passenger, problem

Bought another bus yesterday, couldn't really get to it very well, so it  was 
a pig in a poke until I went to get it.  Didn't pay a whole lot for it,  and 
with dual Dellorto's and a good transaxle I came out pretty well to the  good, 
actually.
2000, converted from FI, 4 speed.
I messed with it some and got it running, but found that #1 has 0  
compression.  Pulled the valve cover and checked some things, and found  that I cannot 
set the lash on the intake for #1.  In fact, the rocker arm  itself is 
contacting the valve spring.  Looking at it, I can see that the  valve spring/stem is 
noticeably farther out (longer) than the others.
I am thinking that the seat has collapsed and allowed the valve to sink  
deeper into the head.
Just out of curiosity, could it be anything else?  (the loss of  compression 
yes, but the valve sticking out farther, I dunno)
I don't need this Bus for transportation, so it can sit (in fact, my  14 year 
old daughter has laid claim to it), and that gives me a couple of years  to 
get it sorted out.
Can a head be pulled with the engine in the Bus?  Don't have the room  right 
now to put it in the garage and pull the engine, but if I could just pull  a 
head, I might try to get it sorted out before cold weather.
I know that this was covered recently, but I sort of skipped over it (I  
didn't have this bus yet.  In fact, wasn't looking for another  one) and it isn't 
yet in the archives.
Thanks,
Greg
