Subject: Loaf bus middle seat FS on eBay
Date: Tue, 2 Feb 1999 08:41:01 -0600 

Saw this one on eBay and thought someone might be interested.  Seat is
located in Tyler, TX.  Minimum bid is currently $25 and ends tonight at 6:08
PST.  That's all I know about it.

&quot;VW Volkswagen 68-79 Bus Middle Seat No Res Item #60796249
This is a 2/3rds length miidle seat for a 68-79 VW bus. The seat is in
excellent shape with no rips or tears in the leatherette upholstery. There
is some very light speckling from mildew but it almost blends with the grain
of the leatherette. The back is in just as good a shape with the original
ashtray and grabhandle in excellent shape also. Very sturdy frame, armrest
is excellent. Seat includes factory hardware to attach it to the floorboard.
