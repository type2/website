Subject: RE: VW-DOGHOUSE OIL COOLER LOCATION-WHY DOES THIS WORK AT ALL?

Tell me why I'm wrong.  Tell me why an external oil cooler set-up, even
one inside the Bus' engine comparment but mounted on the left-side up
towards the exterior air intake half-moon, wouldn't give the poor oil a
better chance to radiate its heat than a doghouse that for all intents and
purposes, appears to allow only a trickle of fan air inside a tiny
enclosure.

Inquiring minds would like to know.

Your idea is good and    -bad. Putting the oil cooler away from the engine
would require piping and hoses in the engine room. Have you seen an engine
room where an oil hose has blown? That´s oil everywhere !
 Very few car manufacturers uses oil hoses in the lubrication systems. The
hoses has a short life span and when they break you have no oil pressure.
The coolers location in the engine bay would also heat the air in the
engine room and preheat the cooling air for the engine. Cooling an
aircooled engine with hot air is no good idea.....

With a high performance engine you might need an external oilcooler plus
the doghouse cooler.

However:
This has been said before on the list regardless the subject. 
-If something on the engine wasn´t necessary or didn´t improve the
function, VW wouldn´t have put it there.

Everybody who have belived that the fan shroud is an empty box with some
outlets for the heating should take a good look in there! 
The VW engineers didn´t put all that time and sheet metal in there just for
fun.
 You can test the function of the doghouse oil cooler in a very simple way: 
-Drive the Bus for a while so it reaches normal operation temperature. 
-Then crawl under the Bus, Put your hand under the air outlet from the oil
cooler. 
-Have a friend rev the engine to about 3000 rpm. 
Do you feel it?
There´s coming air out of there. HOT air!
Somethings on VW engines really looks stupid at a first glance but it works
better than it looks :-)
Mail me and the list and tell us how long you could hold your hand in there.

Have fun!!!
