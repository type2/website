Subject: Re: [T2] knobs under drivers seat

&gt; Couldn't find the second cable due to bad lighting
&gt; and not being able to  
&gt; find a flashlight. More later...

The Eberspdcher BN4 cable is hard to find, even when
you do have a lamp. I parted out a 1972 Deluxe bus
once that had this heater as well. Tried to get the
cable out but simply couln't find where it ran
exactly. Than I ran out of time and the thing had to
go to the crusher :-(


yours,


Vincent
(from your neighbouring country in the north: The
Netherlands :-)
