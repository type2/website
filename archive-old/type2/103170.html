Subject: Re: [T2] Horsepower

&gt;This type 1 vs type 4 debate could go on and on,

You are right about that.


I hate hearing about people putting a type 1 engine in their bus when it was
&gt;meant for a type 4 thinking they are making an improvement.

Sorry but I advocate it. I have seen way to many head failures on type 4 
engine, and have seen many folks drive thier busses 72 on with type 1 
engines with no problem.
&gt;
&gt;I've worked on VW's since 1973 when I worked in a small VW shop.  In a 
&gt;heavy bus, the type 1 engine will not hold up under the load, hills are
&gt;slower and the life of the engine is shorter.  Having a type 1 westy is 
&gt;even
&gt;harder on the little engines.
&gt;
Yes its hard on the engine, but it works

&gt;Type 4 engines don't cost that much more to build, look in the magazines 
&gt;and
&gt;price a type 1 long block, then a type 4 long block.
&gt;

They dont?

&gt;Any engine can be distroyed easily by the right person doing the wrong
&gt;things such as having a bad driving technique or not keeping the engine
&gt;tuned or maintained.  But a type 4 engine does have a much longer life 
&gt;while
&gt;giving out more torque that will flatten out the hills better than a type 1
&gt;engine can.
&gt;
Patially agree. I have been driving with a frind and my bus takes the hills 
better then his. In fact when he drove my bus he was very impressed by the 
power.

&gt;If you've never experienced for yourself the rebuilding, driving, or owning
&gt;of a type 4 engined bus, please don't say these engines are expensive to
&gt;rebuild or no good, you are giving out hear-say and uneducated advice.

Nope. I have seen many type 4 engines die of head death. I have seen 
bearings go bad in them just as often. The only bus that has passed the test 
was very overbuilt from the start and it is a screamer. The 2 liter in it is 
running VERY strong, but thats because it was built that way. The amount of 
money he spent on it should make it that way. But when it comes to getting 
from point A to point B on a budget the type 1 wins hands down.

AGAIN: For a cheap engine and a reliable engine for at least 100,000 miles, 
the stock engine works. And a built right 1776 will do the job. I have only 
had one engine fail on me in a bus, and thats because it was a 1500 that I 
was pushing uphill at 75 mph. No I dont do that anymore.

I am not misinformed, I know that the type 1 can push a bus, and they can 
last. Why? Cause mine does. And I know that type 4 engines fail, because I 
have seen so many of them do so. And when they are rebuilt it costs a lot of 
money. Seems silly to even argue against it.
