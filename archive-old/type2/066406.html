Subject: refrigerator repair

many moons ago my frig stopped working and i mentioned it
to my father (who is an electrician).  he took it out of my
75 camper and got it to work in a couple of days (along with
other things, the dude was amazing).  anyhow,
what he told me (from what i can remember) was that the frig                            was run
by heating ammonia and it must be on level ground and
turned on every once in awhile.  if not the ammonia would get trapped
somewhere in the bowels of the frig and not cool properly.
to remedy this he turned it upside down for a day or two 
and everything worked just fine.
lately though, i took the thing out and use a cooler 
instead.
