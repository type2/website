&gt;What am I missing??????? Has anyone had this symptom???

Problem resolved. Having validated every item that might cause the symptom,
the next step in the Bentley procedure is &quot;replace the computer&quot;. Rather
than doing that, I pulled the old one, removed the cover, and scruitinzed
the solder joints with a magnifying lens. Sure enough, at one resister and
one trisister joint I saw evidence of heat stress.

No new or reman ECU available. Got the correct ECU used from Avvers in
Longview, WA, a consistant good source through the years for experienced VW
parts.

Put in the new (used) ECU. Fired it up. Symptom gone. Reset
timing/idle/mixture. Nominal function.

A correct ECU failure diagnosis. I replaced a Bosch ECU on a Saab once and
one on a VW. All the rest have been Digi-Fail ECU's by others on
Wasserboxers. Perhaps 3 or 4 of those, in 9 years of servicing European
vehicles for to earn my keep.
