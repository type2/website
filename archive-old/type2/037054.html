Subject: Web-site's *finally* up...tell me what you think!

All,

WHEW! I finally got my revised '69 Westy web-site up
tonight... YAY! (The URL's below..)

It's still a *long* way from being done, but it's a
huge improvement (IMHO) over the old one. The new
version is in frames for easier navigation and also
has thumbnails (30 of them, to be exact;-).


I will be tweaking a few things over the next few
weeks and adding more pages/images/links after that,
but you can see it and get an idea of what it's about
now. There are some links that aren't working yet, as
the pages are either not yet finished, or not yet
loaded to the site...these links have no underline.

I hope some of you will check it out and tell me of
any errors, etc. Please, don't be shy...I wan't it to
be user-friendly, as well as a pleasant site to
visit....if you have constructive criticism, let me
know.

Also, to those of you who've sent me the URL's to your
bus-related sites: I've tried to include them all,
BUT... I screwed up and deleted some e-mail ;-( I have
since created a folder on my desktop to prevent any
future deletions.

So...if you want your site listed, *PLEASE* go to the
site, click on the 'BusLinks' link and make *sure* you
aren't already listed. 

If not, my e-mail link is there on the page; just send
me your *COMPLETE* URL (that means, start it with
http://), please. If it's not complete, I can't use
cut-n-paste....and I really hate typing (I only use 2
fingers and a thumb, so it's kinda slow;-).

Here's the URL:
http://www.futureone_dot_com/~jcnkb2/My69WestyFrameSet.html


Thanks,


Jaime
