Subject: Re: [T2] Intake Manifold Stud - liquid thread repair

&gt;Chris: This is the first I've heard of this product. Sounds exciting. Is 
&gt;it a replacement for products like JB Weld?  How does one use it? Coat the 
&gt;threads of the bolt, screw it in?

Exactly. Squirt the hole full of the thread material liquid. Coat the 
threads of the studs with a release agent and screw in. Later when it has 
all setup unscrew if necessary and you have a threaded hole.

Obviously I would not use this on a suspension part or other safety item 
but for &quot;harmless&quot; items like accessory bracket studs or manifold studs I 
think it's worth a try. $10 I think at Advance Auto or Napa (sure others 
have them too).

Like I mentioned it worked for over three years on the head of my 
motorcycle for the cam chain tensioner.

I don't like miracles in a can / tube / jar / etc. and typically am VERY 
skeptical of them but with the motorcycle it was going to be a very 
difficult and expensive repair to fix the threads for the cam tensioner. I 
thought I'd gamble $10 - $15 and it worked. Of course it if hadn't I wasn't 
risking my safety or anything and I think that is important.

It is a Lock-tite product but I don't know the number. I found it near the 
other traditional Lock-tite products in the store.
