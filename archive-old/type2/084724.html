I love having a hydraulic valvetrain (the valves are the same, but you knew 
that!).  Many purists do not, so you won't get a definitive answer from 
this group.  You will not experience valve float until well over 5000rpm 
with hydraulics so don't worry about that.

&gt;I've heard people say bad things about an 1835 in a bus...  that it will
&gt;overheat more, true?   I figured building a decent T1 over the stock bore
&gt;would help me out a lot, but I don't want one that overheats a lot.
&gt;I don't really want to &quot;go fast&quot; I just want my bus to cruise on the freeway
&gt;pretty well.

I don't think a large-displacement engine is what you need.  You simply 
need to spin a stock-ish displacement motor a little faster.  I agree with 
Theodore who suggested a small bump in bore with a stock-stroke 
counterweighted crankshaft and a cam that will allow the motor to have good 
volumetric efficiency at the higher rpms  You may need slightly larger 
valves too, but don't overdo it.  Large valves are way overrated.  If you 
were to go with the bigger motor (1835 or similar) then you would probably 
want to change your gear ratios to lower engine speed on the highway, and 
that seems to me like it would be a lot more trouble and expense.

&gt;I've thought about it some, and I was steering toward a dual carb setup
&gt;before my original post.  I really don't want another VW FI setup ( I have
&gt;had some trouble with my square already).  I was thinking that building a
&gt;little stroker would be good...   but not sure what cam to pair up with it.

Speaking of which, does anyone know what happened to Webcam?  Their 
website, http://www.webcaminc has been gone for a while now.  Are they 
still in business?  I sure hope so, I was getting ready to purchase one of 
their cams.

&gt;Not sure what head options to look at.  There was that build up articles in
&gt;one of the VW mags at the end of the year, anyone remember that buildup
&gt;being a good design?

Don't trust anything you read in those magazines - they are driven by 
different motives than you or I.
