Subject: Re: [T2] 30/31 PICT-3 vacuum signals (was follow up EB06 trip
  report)

When using the SVDA Distributor, use the port on the LEFT side of the
carburetor for an accurate vacuum signal.  The port that is on the base of
the carb at an angle is for the EGR Valve activation hose for 772-74 Bugs
equipped with an EGR Valve.  It is a very poor source for vacuum for the
SVDA. This and others are to be plugged and not used.

&gt; As stated in my previous post, I discovered that my engine had sucked
&gt; the accelerator pump injection tube (little brass tube) into the #2
&gt; cylinder and that is what caused the #2 spark plug to get all bent up.
&gt; I tested the compression and all four cylinders register 115#, so it
&gt; appears that there is no lasting damage to cylinder #2.
&gt; I had a spare carburetor that I put on (see subject line), but I am
&gt; uncertain what vacuum port to use (there are 4).
&gt; On the 34 PICT-3, I used the port on the driver's side, whose vacuum
&gt; signal was 0 at idle, but 15-20 at 3500 RPM.
&gt; This same port on the new carb has a maximum vacuum of 5 (3500 RPM).
&gt; There are three ports facing the rear.  The one in the middle is
&gt; manifold vacuum (15 at idle and near zero as the revs increase), the
&gt; port to the right of that registers no more than 3 under throttle.
&gt; There is a port down low on the carb on the right side that angles up
&gt; that has a similar vacuum signal as the side-facing port on the 34
&gt; PICT-3.  That's the one I'm using for my SVDA distributor.
&gt;
&gt; What is the collective wisdom of the list?
