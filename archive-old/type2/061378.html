Subject: bus air conditioners

I have an AC in my bus (dunno who installed it, it's a huge white console above
the cockpit) and I was wondering if the blower for it can be converted for
auxiliary heating in any way.. I DONT need air conditioning, but I could use
some more heat.  (actually since I don't have any heat, I should work on fixing
my regular heat first, but I'm curious if the AC has any use.. I tried turning
it on once when it was still hot and it just made the oil pressure light come
on (I had plenty of oil)).

Thanks!
