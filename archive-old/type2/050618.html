You paid to much for the toy when you could have got it from you local
Wal-Mart for $12.00.

&gt; Listees,
&gt;     I was in the local hobby shop today picking up a pinewood derby car
for
&gt; my son, and saw the &quot;show stoppers&quot; car set that consists of a vw
&gt; transporter, trailer, and vw.  It is a really nice set.  I bought 2 extra
&gt; for the list at $22 each including my local tax.  If anyone wants one,
pmail
&gt; me.
