Subject: RE: [T2] 72-79 Pick-ups?

&gt;  Type-4-engined pickups were available abroad
&gt; (like the Netherlands), but never in Germany.

&gt; in any case might try central America, when I was 
&gt;  last in Nicagagua they were dern near everywhere


My '78 German made crew cab (with type 4 engine) came from El Salvador.
