Subject: diesel

My daily driver is dying a slow death and my 73 Rivera Bus won't fit in
my parking garage downtown Seattle.  Just a few inches too tall.  I am
looking at a 87 vw Jetta that has had the FI engine replaced with a
diesel from a golf.  Does anyone in the King county are know what the
emissions testing rules are for a gas car that has been converted to
diesel? The one person I got at the DOl did not know the answer.  Thanks
for your time.



Daniel
