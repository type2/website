Well, i have been lurking around and not saying anything for a while now,and
now i feel a little more accepted since i acually bought a van(more on that
later) so i thought i whould introduce myself.....

My name is Adam Garberg, i live in Moorhead,Minnesota.(by Fargo,ND)....i 15
years old, (yea i know i dont have my license, but i will in november)I have
had a passion my whole(small) life for VW's paticulary Busse's and Van's, i
dont know why either...but i think you all know what i am talking about...

A couple of days ago at work i was looking at the newspaper......and there it
was.....1972 camper/van , new rebuild.....SWEET, i always wanted one of those,
so i called the guy, looked at it, and fell in love(now my parents werent as
exited as i was....but it is my money and they liked that it only had 77k on
chassis, and 4k on rebuild)a week went by and i did every bit of reasearch on
it as possible(including monitoring the list) and figured that with all the
resources, i could handle a beast like this(thanks all of you)!!!

 the van is a 72, but it has some camper bits in it that will come in handy
for bike race trips....it is in good shape with the exception of a dent and
rusted thru spot on the drivers side .....but i can fix that for about 200
usd. the interior is in good shape...if anyone is curious he was asking 23,
but i got himn down to 19.......


thanks to all of you, this will be the best first car anyone can have!!!!
