Subject: loose generator noises, whoopie!

yao tse tung, i had a vdub scare! the first time a type 1 generator pully
loosens at 5mph...its loco. resembles the sound of taking a christmas tree
down in five minutes. talk about your bad sounding volkswagen noises. eight
blocks away from the comfort of my bus lawn, and raining - my daughter and
i walked in the oregon every-other hourly sprinkle rain. hours later [truck
cooled down while we hiked over college hill] i got back to me old stranded
and to a bad, bad, mad, mad pulley. the nut wasn't finger tight. upon
inspection, thing looked like it had a million miles on it.  thanks muir
for the direction. don't loose cool... find proper torque.   i knew those
68-only 30A generators would come in handy. they're holding my new upper
pulley   - steve, 68 doublecab
