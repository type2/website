&gt; ... so I guess it's all your sense of value's or interpretation of soiled
and junk--...

Or...

It's all in what's more important in your life at the time.  Food and
shelter for your family, or a $3000.00 to $5000.00 paint job for the bus.
I'm not ashamed of my current financial condition, and I figure that
stopping or at least slowing down the rust is preferable to waiting until I
can afford a $3000.00+ repaint, window seal refurbishing, and etc. job.

At present, even $3000.00 is more than I can pay myself for two months work
with getting my business through it's first year.  A case of rattle cans
runs about $11.43, and I figure about 4 cases to get the job looking decent.
So $42.72 for the paint, maybe $20.00 for the wire brush doodads for the
drill and for the Dremel, and a lot of free labor.  Less than $65.00 total
(not including sodas and burgers to keep my son interested in helping Dad
with the job).

Will my bus then be a filthy, &quot;obviously&quot; unloved &quot;rat&quot;?  I think not. :O)
