Subject: Any ideas?

I just attempted to give the 72 a tune up...it was kinda hiccuping (losing power to the point of feeling like it was facing resistance, like towing a sloppy trlr that was too heavy anyway) and backfired twice.  This set in all the sudden. One day it was fine, the next day it was sympomatic. I have replace the fuel filter, points, condenser, wires, plugs, dist cap, rotor and coil.  Now the darned thing will not start at all, it wants to, it will turn over like it is going to, but just a little back fire and nothing else.  I can't start the car to even attempt to set the timing or tach/dwell.  The plugs are torqued to 20 lbs and the gap on the plugs set to specs in the muir book. Does anyone have a clue as to what could be an issue? Any idea at all???thanks
