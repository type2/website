Subject: Re: [T2] Imported Brazillian Busses

Down here, customs doesn't seem to care. Thousands of Mexican vehicles cross 
the river everyday. Fifteen miles north at the Border Patrol checkpoint, 
they don't seem to care either. The Mexican government is another story when 
I venture south of their checkpoint...

AFAIK, Brazilian busses were air-cooled up until they stopped making them 
last year.

&gt;Probably a Mexican bus if it was water cooled.
&gt;
&gt;We see a few Mexican buses hereabouts.  I have a feeling that US customs
&gt;is pretty sticky about keeping track of vehicles that cross the border.
