Subject: RE: Mexican hatch seal 

I think the question that needs to be asked is whether the OEM seal has =
the molded corners like the original did.  I put in the Mex. seal a few =
months ago and for the most part it works ok.  I need to reglue a 3&quot; =
section of the upper edge where the seal doesn't seal but other than =
that it works.  If the OEM seal had molded corners and was of slightly =
heavier material I'd be inclined to spend the extra $40 (I'm even =
considering junking my new Mex. seal if the OEM is like what was in =
there originally).  The Mex. seal is simply a length of rubber bulb that =
is joined into a circle (there is a slight relief for the striker =
plate).  My $.02
