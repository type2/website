A couple of weeks ago there was a thread regarding availability of fuel =
tanks for 68 - 71 type 2s.  Sat here smugly thinking that's got nothing =
to do with me - well guess what...

Does anyone out there have a source for these fuel tanks?  I remember a =
couple of members were able to identify a few sources.  The fuel tanks =
I've come across in the local junk yards have been in pretty bad shape =
themselves.

Thanks,

Juan

PS
I'm the guy who started the recent thread about summer travels - really =
am enjoying - and taking to heart -  all the advice and conversation!  =
Thanks!!!
