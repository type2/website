Hi Alan,

I assume you mean CV joint boots...

The only reason for not having a clamp on the inner end is that the person
fitting the boot either didn't bother or forgot.

If the CV boots are undamaged but missing the clamp then you could just use
a wide tie wrap around the boot end to prevent further ingress of water and
dirt but it would be better to take it off, clean it an repack it with new
Molybendium grease first.

All the CV boots I've ever bought have always come with the clamp, 6 new
trisquare bolts (remember folks VW say these are use once items) and the
correct grease repacking the joint.

If the boot kit doesn't come with all these bits then source a different
make of boot!

Good luck

Does every one who owns around a '78 bus not have a clamp on
the inner portion of the boot?

It seems odd to me that they would leave that open to water
seeping in.
