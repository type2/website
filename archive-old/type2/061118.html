Subject: Replacement Seatbelts

I kinda caught this thread half-way in, but someone was talking about
replacement belts (original post)

I just wanted to mention that my recent JC Whitney replacements were quite
satisfactory in my '79 Westy -- altho' it took some tinkering with the
retractor mounts (L-shaped things) to make them clear the doors -- tight
fit!!  But, now that they're in, they work very well.  I got them for $229.
for the pair, including all taxes and shipping to Canada.

Of course, that translated to slightly under half a million dollars,
Canadian.... but worth it!!
