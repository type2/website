Subject: Re: [T2] Still no get up and go

Cam is such a high wear item that it is recommended that the old cam
never be reused in an engine rebuild, but conversely, I've never had a
cam fail before rebuild time.

 Any insight on how long it would take to wear down a cam lobe? John claims
 he kept regular mainanence on his valve adjustments, but to me a worn cam
 lobe seems like something that would take a long time to achieve. Any input
 may help John and others to avoid this in the future.
 
 Thanks again for all the help!!
