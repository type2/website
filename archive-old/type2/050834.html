Check out Nikki's site and you might follow some of her links, she loves
her adventure wagon.

Somewhere, but I can't find the link, someone has adventure sales
information posted.  Some really neat stuff.


&gt;Greetings all. New to this list, but not to dubs. My question stems from my
&gt;one and only baywindow. It is a 1973 Adventure high roof camper. Anyone else
&gt;have/heard of these? My interior is in pieces and I would love to find pics
&gt;of one to see how it is supposed to be. Was it originally equipped with an
&gt;electric refrigerator like mine has now?  TIA!
