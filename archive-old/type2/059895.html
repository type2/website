Subject: please help me get my steering fixed.
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

the little nub on the front of the front axle beam has developed a tear in
the metal about 2 inches long making it difficult to steer and impossible to
convince my wife that there is any value in spending any more money on my
beloved 71 bus.  Any thoughts on replacement/repair?  I just put $2100 into
a new engine w/hydraulic lifters &amp; electronic ignition so i'd love to not
have to go spend $15000 on the pontiac transsport my wife wants, but being a
happy man requires being married to a happy woman so . . .

Am i better off finding a replacement california body for my rusted out van?
Does anyone have one?  Is my van destined to be a towable billboard for my
onsite computer repair business?  Will Ted marry Thelma?  Will Shara recover
from her drug induced coma?  What will happen in the next installment of
&quot;The Van Is Just Sitting There?&quot;
