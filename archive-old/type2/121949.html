Subject: RE: [T2] 72 heater controls

The flapper on the pipe, up front and under the dash, going to the
defrosters work opposite of what it looks
The two levers (fare right) that should of had red dash knobs, have to be
all the way down to open the flappers, this pulls the cables up and out of
the guide tube to open the heater boxes to let the air go to the front. 
The other to levers that should have blue knobs are the fresh air vents,
these should be all the way up to push the flappers to the front air vents
down to close them.
Just remember heat is cable operated, fresh air is all hard linked to the
front vents. 

Hope that helps!

Doug...

Subject: [T2] 72 heater controls


Hi All,

I finally got my 72 out of the garage and back on the street!  Problem 
is, I don't know how to use the heater controls (the knobs/handles are 
missing and I am freezing when I drive it.  I can work the controls 
from under the dash but I need to know the combination that is likely 
to allow some heat to come my way.

Any help is always appreciated!

Thanks,

Dave
