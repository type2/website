Friday I was driving downtown (Eugene) and saw an unusual sight, right 
after this thread began.

There's a yellow/tan camper, with a fiberglass high-top. Just above the 
side doors, there was a large smoke stack sticking out (sideways).

Soooo.... he's either fitted that thing with a wood stove, or a 
Allison/Detroit 12 cylinder diesel.  Sounds like he's fixed his heating 
problems, one way or the other.
