Subject: A Different Starting Problem

Today my bus decided it didn't want to start any more.  Unfortunately, it
did this at a gas station in a part of town for which I was wearing the
wrong colors.  Remind me to pick up something nice in scarlet...

When I turn on the key, I get the idiot lights, but when I turn it, nothing,
no dimming, no clicking whirring or anything.

Anyway, before I left work I played with it a bit.

Knowns:

Battery is peachy, checked and topped up 4 weeks ago.  Headlights are bright
Starter and starter bushing replaced in July
Battery cables replaced in June

(with car blocked and out of gear and ignition on)

When I short the red wire on the starter and the small post on the solenoid,
the car starts immediately.  I had someone turn the key on while I held a
test light to the lead that goes on the solenoid, and it was dead. 

This tells me there is an open somewhere between the key (ie ignition
switch) and where that wire connects to the solenoid.  Make sense?  Any
other ideas?

I also have one of those funky relays installed.

I am in the house warming up right now, and then I'll go out and play with it.

Wish me luck.
