are you
&gt;going to get the push rod tubes out from around the push rods? Happy wrenching!

&gt; Hey everybody!! 
&gt;
&gt; I am going to undertake the task of stopping the oil 
&gt;stains that our 80 westy just loves to leave behind. Could 
&gt;any body tell me, Do the push rod tube slide out through 
&gt;the head? Do I need to remove the head to get to them? What 
&gt;sealant should I use? 

You do NOT have to remove the heads to remove the push rod tubes on a Type
IV engine. It's a pretty simple operation, just remove the rocker arm
assembley and a wire retainer and then the tubes can be removed through the
head. Check in the archives for a more detailed description of this entire
process, cleaning the area where the seals seat, using the right sealant,
getting the proper seals, etc.
