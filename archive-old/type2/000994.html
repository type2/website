Subject: Will a 77 windshield fit my 71?

OK, folks, I need you quick.  I've found a 77 bus in a junkyard on the way
up north of here, and a bus crazed friend is willing to pick up the
windshield for me on the way to his cottage tomorrow (Friday pm).  Will it
fit my 71?

Also, I'm feeling game and think I could do this myself with a good German
gasket.  Not to resurrect old threads, but what's your take on patient but
rank amateurs doing that?  I should add that by then the sill will be filled
in (rust holes) and I also think I can do that without building it up.
Nothing like the optimism of beginners, eh?
