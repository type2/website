&gt;Well, I'm jealous now.

&gt;My brother came back from Germany with a brand-spankin' new 
&gt;B3-LC Eberspacher gas heater.  (for his bug 'vert, he's driving it
&gt;year 'round in Newfoundland)
&gt;
&gt;I don't have the specs handy, but let me just say, its a thing of
&gt;beauty.  Its got a hard plastic case, and it has aluminum fins in
&gt;it just like the old heater boxes.  The unit is square, shorter 
&gt;than a BN2, but a bit bigger around.  Gorgeous.  Apparently it runs
&gt;completely soundless.  We'll see about that one.
&gt;
&gt;It measures the temp of incoming air (in a recirc setup), compares it
&gt;against the dial in the dash, to figger out what heat setting to 
&gt;run the heater at.  My brother opted out of the digital control
&gt;(150dm more)
&gt;
&gt;Now the heart stopper:  1500$CDN, bout a grand US.  Ouch.

&gt;
Having spent four (bitter cold) years in Newfoundland, I would have thought
the price a bargain
