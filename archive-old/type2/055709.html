&gt;speaking of low impact. . .we could all impact the woods a lot less and

&gt;practice low impact in the woods, when the population doubles again in 34

Talking of low impact, if one does not need all that space why have a type 2

in the first place!

If we all limit our family to one or two children we could all drive around

in Nissan Micras. If we wanted to go to the woods we could just take a tent!

hello.   I drive around in a type 2, and have no children.   Also, I have no
Nissan Micra.    I really think owning a VW bus is not related to family size
or the lack thereof.    This is also suggested on a historical basis by the
number of middle seats that have disappeared- if the bus was commonly used to
carry a bunch of people the middle seats would have be still in use and not
dumped somewhere.     Regardless of driving VWs, bicycling, or whatever,
having more children does have a greater impact (negative, sorry guy) on our
world.   When people have more than two children I start to wonder if they
have heard of birth control.  (Well, they probably have *heard* of it.)  Low
impact does matter.   But this is the type 2 list, not the list for discussion
of family size so I abjectly apologize for this post.  And to bring it up to
type2 standards .... and answer a question he raised....

The reason I drive around in a type 2 is I think it is so friggin groovy.    I
always liked bugs when I was a little kid, but then I wanted to go ....
camping!  And I was looking for a car to buy and I looked at VW buses and saw
this Westy pop top and it seemed like such a great set up, with the table and
cabinets and folding bed and icebox and storage under the seats and all.   I
was so happy.   I haven't been tent camping in ages, and am pleased to be able
to have my cosy camper bed and stuff with me.  Okay, I went tent camping a
couple times, on backpacking trips, but it was a pain as my leg is messed up
from where it was broken when I was 16, so unfortunately I had to admit that
long hikes with a pack are just not my thing.    

Almost time for the 3rd annual &quot;I hate men&quot; campout.     Last time I won a bet
to get Jan to laugh beer out her nose on a public street.  :)   Any VW womens
in the PNW interested in joining for a day or so of laughter and good times?
A sense of humour is a must.  We are thinking of going to the beach this time.
Probably in late May, or early June.
