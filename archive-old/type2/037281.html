non-silicone PR tube seals leak almost from when they are new. With those
#s, I think he doesn't need headwork at all, just a gasket/seal change.

&gt; Pat,
&gt;
&gt; Good compressions!  I agree that new fuel lines and new pushrod tube seals
&gt; are in order and will get you many miles down the road... but... if you
&gt; are going as far as taking the tin off to retorque the heads, I would go
&gt; one step further.
&gt;
&gt; I beleive that the valve guides in VW's are an unsuspected weak point.
&gt; If you are far enough in to retorque, then you are far enough in to pop
&gt; the heads off, take them to a machine shop and ask them to measure valve
&gt; guide wear.  This should be less than $50 and a day or two.  If the valve
&gt; guides are worn, the amount of blow-by is very large, and I believe that
&gt; this is what causes pushrod tube seal failure.  I have no data, just my
&gt; personal belief, but there it is, my humble opinion.  I would welcome
&gt; other opinions or more data.  Anyone?
&gt;
