Subject: Re: RE: westy tent for the rat?

hi

Does the rat have the hatch in the roof? 
- - - - 
no, and im glad because i want to put a roof rack on it.  it has the SO 44
westy kit with the fold out &quot;Z&quot; bed and cabinet in the back,  and backwards
facing seat and cooler box behind the bench seat.


  My '64 has those four brackets, and I
have the tent poles, but haven't yet gotten the fabric for the tent (one of
these days, I'll get a sail shop to make one up for me).  Sorry the poles are
not FS.- - -
lucky you 

  I can't clue you as to whether the back bumper has a bracket, since
mine is not original, but I did find a front bumper with bracket and
overriders
for mine in a junk yard (I was so surprised that I bought it even though
that's
not what I went there for).
- - - 
i do that too

  I can say that the rear pole fits nicely into the
hole in the rear bumper where the overrider should be.  This stuff is getting
rarer than hen's teeth, so good luck on your search.

didnt expect to find one, but there's no harm in asking.
