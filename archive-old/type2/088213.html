&quot;Robert S. Whitaker&quot; wrote How does one tell if it's a 1968 arm?

If my information is correct=20

68 Type2 Bus would appear to have a wiper shaft that is like a split =
screen bus
The wiper arm attaches by a cross bolt  that bears on a flat on the =
wiper
shaft,  (rather than a screw that goes  through the top of the wiper arm
attachment and down the wiper shaft). The cross bolt runs though a =
plastic
liner that also holds the cross bolt nut in place. =20
The left and right arms are differrent the left having a different set =
angle where the wiper blade
attaches. Sorry no picture, I'aint got one. Yet!
Yours Aye Russ
