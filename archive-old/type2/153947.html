Subject: Re: [T2] removing windshield scratches

----- Original Message ----- 
From: &quot;Jack Dinan&quot;
&gt; Given the difficulty of finding windshield rubber that works, I would like 
&gt; to explore removing the scratches and haze

I don't know anything about removing scratches...

are you saying the windshield seals quality is poor.... ?  I installed a 
seal recently .. and watched one put in as well.. both went well and looked 
great to me??
