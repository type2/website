Subject: Re: [T2] Listee stickers

Hi,
I'm in Australia &amp; I'd like 1 or 3 of the stickers.
I'm not sure how much the return mail is going to be
though.
Should I send the extra money needed for postage in
the money-order/bank-cheque for the stickers or is
there another way to go about it?
By the way, the stickers are the vintage bus ones
aren't they.......i.e. the one on thesamba_dot_com?
Let me know what you'd like me to do.
It may be a good idea to let people on the list know
what to do if they are overseas &amp; would like some
stickers because I know of quite a few non-U.S. list
members in the same boat as myself in terms of the
mail situation.
Cheers
