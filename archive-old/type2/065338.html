Isn't this show put on by the Kascade Kombi's?

no,  we put on Vintage Meet in July.  Oktobugfest is put on by Semaphore,  Po
box 66071, Seattle, Wa   I have no phone no.

 Take I 5 south to the Puyallup exit south of tacoma.   Go a few (7?) miles
till the sign posts for the Puyallup Fairgrounds.  There are motels near the
fairgrounds, I don't know about camping.
