&gt; &gt;I do not find German rubber to be of particularly high durability.  The
&gt; &gt;American 15/32 vacuum hose has been in service for a number of years and
&gt; &gt;is still like new.

&gt; Some of it is old. If you're lucky enough to see the DOM stamped on the
hose you'll sometimes be surprised how old your new hose is.

AAMOF, my brake vacuum hose is stamped 1990.  Still looks and feels good.

No, I don't keep my fuel lines anywhere near that long!  :)
