Subject: Mega squirt

So, mega squirt is only for FI motors, somewhat like toyota employed on the
early MAS, engines, ...just a warm up, by enriching device, as opposed to Maf,
with &quot;rich injectors&quot; all around at startup?  My question begs the question,
FI only?
I am running &quot;big&quot; T/C Dels, and wanted to prepare myself for what I should
expect for &quot;cool&quot; climate starts, anyone have this setup on same motor?  &quot;two
pumps&quot;, foot to the floor?
