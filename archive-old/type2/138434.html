Subject: Re: [T2] instrument panel lights

&gt; ALL 5 bulbs in the cluster light string burned out at once?!?
&gt;
&gt; Does not sound like it could happen. Are you sure you have power to 
&gt; the sockets?
&gt; Or did you actually loose the resister in the headlight switch?

OK, I was being hyperbolic.  I lost the fuel gauge cluster and speedo 
light.  The one by the levers was already blown.  The hazard light 
switch and the new gauges are still lit on the same circuit, so I don't 
think it could be the switch (they were unhooked when I had my probe 
&quot;accident&quot;).  What's the 5th?  Rear defogger?  Never has been lit.

There is 12v to the sockets.  I pulled one bulb and the filament is 
broken.  The resistor works like all the dimmers I've ever had.  Two 
settings: bright and flicker.

thanks,
joe
