Well, instead of doing a &quot;print&quot;,
do a &quot;print preview&quot; from your web browser, and see what you get.

Here's a Scenario ...............

OK
We want to be able to find help when we travel.
What do we do?

AA)
Let's say we're going on a trip.
BB)
We go to the AIRS site with our browser to download data on all the 
various states we will be in, as far as fellow AIRS members signing up.
CC)
Now, what do we do?
DD)
Dump each state to print so we can carry the list with us?

Makes sense.

Try it, and see what happens.
Go ahead, try it.
See what sort of list you get in print.

OR
Do &quot;print preview&quot; with your browser.
See what you get.
Go ahead. Do it !

The AIRS concept is truly great, but, as is, you need a lap top and an 
Internet connection with you when you break down so as to be able to 
access the needed membership data.
