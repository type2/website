&gt;Hey everyone,
&gt;
&gt;So I've decided to give another go at getting my '78 fi back on the 
&gt;road, but I'm STILL having quite a problem figuring out what exactly 
&gt;is wrong with it.
&gt;
&gt;The last time it ran, which was probably almost a year ago,

Verify that the fuel filter is not plugged from the goo that develops 
in the fuel when sitting for long periods. Take it off, drain it from 
the back into a clean cup, then blow through it. Compare to new 
filter. Install new if old gives resistance or a bunch of crud drains 
out the back into the cup.

&gt;I installed and set the points the proper distance, I attached all 
&gt;the wires and made sure everything was snuggly in place, I even 
&gt;found where tdc was and set the points accordingly.

You don't set timing by adjusting the points. You turn the dizzy to set timing.

&gt;   I also checked the spark to make sure that the coil was functional.

Hot blue SNAP!!! spark at the gap. A yellow &quot;phuuut&quot; confirms weak engergy.

&gt;  The spark plugs
&gt;  themselves are out of the question because I had just installed 
&gt; new ones prior to the tune up.

Confirm proper brand and gaps.

&gt;  After this ordeal, I grew quite frustrated and gave up on it for 
&gt; quite a while, leaving it to sit until I had more time to work on it.
&gt;
&gt;   The reading came up as 11.6 and the connections were snug.

A fully charged battery will rest at 12.6+. Anything less than about 
12.3 will start to cause problems of weak spark energy and slow 
turning when trying to start.

&gt;   Some how, even though the battery has full charge (according to 
&gt; the vom), the bus still will not even turn over, it only clucks 
&gt; when the ignition is turned like the battery is dead.

11.6 volts IS discharged. Gotta fix that first.

&gt;  Even more confusing is the fact that the dashboard lights all go 
&gt; on with no dimming, as well as the parking lights, but the 
&gt; headlights don't go on at all.  Could the battery be dead even 
&gt; though the vom says other wise?

As above, yes, your battery must be not less than 12.6 for good results.

&gt;Or is there a possible cause I'm completely overlooking?

Now, if you fix the battery and confirm hot spark at right time and 
the fuel filter is good, you have one of several other possible faults to find.
1.) compression, vehicles that sit for a long time sometimes will 
develop corrosion on the cylinders/rings and upon trying to start, 
will instantly scratch the cylinders and lose compression.
2.) you must do a fuel pressure test. Anything less than 23 lbs in 
the loop during starting could well be the problem.
3.) Temp sensor at the No. 3 cylinder. Verify per Bentley.
4.) AFM, verify that the flap swings freely. Other tests per Bentley.
5. Vaccuum leaks. Search archive for &quot;Vacuum Schlucks&quot;.
