Bob,

My experience is limited to '71 and earlier buses, but I have found on early bays particularly, that there are weak solderings (is that a word?) in the turn signal/dimmer assembly. The wires in there are tight and when the screws get loose on that turn signal assembly and I start twisting it up and down on the steering column--as I signal my turns--eventually something in there comes undone.

I suspect in your soldering that you managed to create a pathway for the electricity fed from your ignition switch (enabling lights or turn signals) into the dimmer relay. Also, that cover may be touching when you put it back on...you could check with the turn signal assy cover off, I guess.

I don't think I've ever replaced an entire turn signal/dimmer switch from a bay window bus, but if it works on the same principle as the late splitties ('67)--my Bay Window Bentley confirms this--the key is the wiring harness that feeds through the steering column and under the dash. All of the wires in that harness have connectors on the other side; that's the trick--no soldering required. The caveat is that you have to disconnect the steering column and the *remember/mark* where all those wires go. If you have a wiring diagram, you'll probably be able to see where the wires from the turn signal are joined with other wires through connectors.

&gt;Question: Are such things symptomatic of a bad relay, or a dying switch?

I would suspect the relay, but if it's a metal relay and you pry the cover off, you may find that it's an electromagnetic switch. I had one in a '67 bus with a leaky windscreen and was able to restore the relay by cleaning rust out of it. The relay sat upside down, filling with water everytime it rained.

Hope this rambling reply helps!

Good luck! Joe

PS. I think I have an extra lying around, but I can't commit it for at least a couple weeks. The '72 is going on the road as my primary transporter-ation, so I need the backup until I know it works.
