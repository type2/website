Trouble with '73  models is these little details.  I had hinge problems but
was able to machine new parts.
Reconditioned hinges and new screws are available from Alan H Schofield.
His catalogue is online.  Just point the browser to www.ahschofield.co_dot_uk
Last price I have for them is (exchange items) £14
Current rate of exchange = $22.  It is an alternative if you cannot find a
local refurbisher at the
right price.  Shipping wouldn't be much but is another factor.
