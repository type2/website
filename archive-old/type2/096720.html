&lt;&lt; If people would put half as much care and upkeep into a modern car as they 
did in the 50's and 60's cars that required it, modern cars would last 
forever. Of course despite all of these modern time saving and labor saving 
devices - we are the most &quot;busy&quot; of any generation in a century.

Buddy of mine got a late model Japanese car for free that only needed a
&quot;little work&quot;...Electronic problems were such that the car was worthless
without thousands of dollars in labor to rebuild a cooked electrical system.
A lot of it was spec'd at just getting access to the wiring, etc. There's
something to be said for old fashioned nuts and bolts and screws that
come apart as opposed to the snap fittings and one way barbs that hold
so much modernity together...;-(
