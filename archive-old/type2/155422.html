Subject: Bridgestone R623? opinions?

Looking at a nearly new set (1000 miles) for a very reasonable price, this is a very high load range, 8 ply 104/106 LR, highway ribbed commercial tire.  Has anyone ever run this tire (doesn't appear to have ever been common in the US) and if so, just how bad is it in the wet.  I'm looking at it for a 3 season tire and have no allusions to it being able to get out of its own way in even a light dusting of snow, but wonder about whether or not it is safe in the rain.  The only info I can find on the www is Bridgestone propaganda that says it is actually wonderfull, go figure, but they do rate it higher than a number of their own other products for handling, braking, traction, in the wet.  If it is as good as a Yoko Y356, I'll be happy, but I'd like someone who has run em to tell me if it is.
   
  Thanks
  John
