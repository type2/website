Subject: [T2] winter sand bags

This is my first real winter in my bus. We recieved a good 8 inches 
yesterday and I took my bus out for some practice. I noticed a lack of 
steering alot of the time, even though i kept it pretty slow. I have two 
80lb. sandbags out in my barn and I was wondering if using them up front in 
the bus would help much? I would probably put them in between the front 
seats. Has anyone else ever done this? Any thoughts would be appriciated.
