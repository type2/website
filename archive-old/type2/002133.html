Surely you jest. Perhaps not.
A young man who apparently loves VW buses and desires to learn all he can
about them is cynically derided for spelling errors! What a ludicrous way to
lose the input from a young subscriber because he doesn't meet your
standards of language usage. There may be a bus &quot;in a field&quot; that may never
be saved due to your pompous and arrogant nit-picking. I hope the young man
has the ego-strength to ignore the manifestations of your quirk. Actually
the primary intent of this message is to salve his ego if need be. The
secondary intent should be obvious.
I've had the good fortune in my 60+ years to meet and hire some amazingly
adept mechanics whose spelling was atrocious. Without them I wouldn't have
been able to pursue my  hobby/love of bringing old buses back to life albeit
slowly as I am not gifted with natural mechanical ability. I gladly pay to
have work done that mechanically-inclined folks can do in my stead. I truly
admire them.
Yes, there are spelling errors in his message and on his website. If you
read his message contextually, did you understand what he was saying?
Perhaps your style is to disregard an entire message based on spelling
errors. That is your loss. The usage of the word &quot;far&quot; in the original
message was far more accurate than your correction.
One of my grandchildren is dyslexic and frequently misspells words but
writes insightful papers for school. Only on second reading do I bring out
the &quot;red pencil&quot; per his request.
Using your spelling talents, find the misspelled word in this message and
then get back on type 2 track. There are folks on this list who continually
amaze me with their knowledge of and attention to VW detail. They may
occasionally misspell words but it never lessens my attention to what they
can teach me.
Your message coupled with your e-mail address is a scary combination to
behold!
