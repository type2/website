&gt;I have a 72 bus and on the dash next to the heater controls is a little 
&gt;yellow light that has a B on it.  Just yesterday for the first time it 
&gt;came on.   What does this mean?

In case you haven't got the message already, it means there is a problem with 
your brake system.  In 68-73 buses the &quot;B&quot; light is not connected to the 
parking brake in any way.  If it comes on, you either have so little fluid in 
your reservoir that you're sucking air into your master cylinder or some 
portion of your brake system has failed.  Either way, you need to inspect the 
system and bleed it.

On 68-73 buses, you could press the light to test it.  Starting in 74, the 
light was no longer testable in this fashion and it also became used in 
conjunction with a manual switch located on the plate by the hand brake to tell 
you your hand brake was not completely released.

On a side-note, if you're loosing brake fluid regularly and can't figure out 
where it is going, it's probably leaking from your master cylinder into your 
brake booster.  That's bad because the fluid is corrosive and will eventually 
ruin your booster.  If that's the case, you'll need to rebuild/replace your MC 
and remove your booster to poor the fluid out of it.
