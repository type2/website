Subject: Gear Shifter Stuck &quot;Down&quot; ?

Strangest thing happened.

Itch is running a 091 tranny, 6K miles old. Shifts smooth. Life is good.

Take him to the Jiffy Lube for his 3K oil change.

The petroleum engineer had to back Itch up to check the front end.
Apparently gets into reverse, but the tranny locks the rear wheels cold, and
then the gear shift won't go into or out of any &quot;gear&quot;, unless I unload
pressure on the rear wheels. The shift pattern is unrecognizable. What feels
like neutral is some forward gear (I hit the starter with the clutch out,
and it felt like it was in third gear).

Life turns into hell.

After 15 minutes of fiddling, I made some gear changes pulling up on the
shifter, and something must have gone right, 'cuz at some point, Itch
shifted as if nothing ever happened. Drove him this W/E without problems,
and to work today w/o problems. It's just as if nothing happened.

What happened?
