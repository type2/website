Subject: rear seat

I have an excess rear seat from a 79 bus that will be given to anyone
that wants to have it.  Color is brown.  Condition is good (with one
small tear in the lower section), with very light surface rust on the
legs of the frame.  I need the space, and will &lt;gasp&gt; throw it out if
there is no new home for it in 2 weeks.  I am near Dayton OH.
