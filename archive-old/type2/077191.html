Subject: Re: [T2] Fuel Injection problems

Mark,

I went thru the same thing with my 78 that had been sitting for 8 years.

Tank had *not* been drained...a royal pita.  I found out this wekend that
something is still floating around in it and I am going to have to pull it
anyway.

I replaced the fuel pump, 4 rebuilt injectors, 1 new cold start valve,
pressure regulator.  *ALL* fuel lines. It fired on the 6th turn.

Start at page one of the fi part of the bently manual and do *all*
the checks.  

You might try soaking the injectors in injector or carb cleaner, but after
seeing what sad shape my fuel lines were in, I decided to replace all
instead of going with carbs.

Cheers, dave

&gt; Hello Fellow Bus Friends:
&gt; 
&gt; I have been trouble shooting my 78 for several months
&gt; now (I bought it from a guy who let it sit for 5 years
&gt; after letting all the gas out of he
&gt; tank)(surprisingly, little rust)  anyways, I have been
&gt; following bentley pretty good but I am in a tough
&gt; spot.  
&gt; 
&gt; I had to replace the fuel pump because it was seized
&gt; up, replaced the fuel filter, all fuel line.  The
&gt; results I know of so far: the cold start valve works
&gt; because the thing fires at the little bit if fuel that
&gt; the valve supplies.  I pulled the injectors, none of
&gt; them fire any fuel.  The hot lead is working just
&gt; fine, because if I ground a test light elsewhere, it
&gt; lights.  I understand that the negative is switched
&gt; for the injectors.
&gt; 
&gt; Can anybody give me any leads, any secrets?  I have
&gt; tested most things on the long plug thingy, don't
&gt; remember what it is called right now, they all seem
&gt; fine.  I have a few more to test.
&gt; 
&gt; Help? Anybody?
&gt; 
&gt; Kindest Regards
