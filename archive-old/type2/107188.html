Subject: Re: [T2] Fuel tank return fuel nipple (converting to FI)

Well Dave &amp; George, it's nearly impossible to get a 2.0L tank here 
(Montreal), i will have to deal with mine! I've search before!
Unless there is a giver on the list? (but my tank is in real good shape)

I don't care about fitting everything (ECU, AFM/air filter housing...) 
in the Bus, I have an &quot;MIG&quot; welder and i will have a donnor for the 
holder/bracket. I did some miracle saving my heater box so i guess i can 
do other dificult welding and modification.

The question is: if only 1 vetilation tube is enough if i use the other 
one only for the return FI line? (my tank is full of fuel now, that is 
somewhat a small problem!!!!

I could also remove the fuel sender and make a hole in/beside this 
one???? the PO did cut the metal (body) to replace the sender so i have 
a lots of place to work from the top!!!! (Sadly)

I need to know if someone tried that before!

Thanks guys!
Ben

What i wonder

&gt;Get the tank...it will be easier and better.  Can't imagine the t working 
&gt;well at all.
&gt;
&gt;Only thing on going to FI would be that you will want the front top engine 
&gt;cover plate as it already has a hole in the right place for the pressure
&gt;regulator return.
&gt;
&gt;Do you have a cutout where the ecu connects to the wiring harness and 
&gt;hides behind a panel?
&gt;
&gt;1.7 heads may have different valve sizes than the 2.0l heads that were 
&gt;designed for FI.
&gt;
&gt;Probably a few other gotchas, bu probably not too bad.
&gt;
&gt;Cheers and good luck, dave
