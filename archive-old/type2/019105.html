Subject: Strange VIN/Manufacturer plate...
Message-ID: &lt;381CB9AB.3D2400C2_at_empire_dot_net&gt;

    I just got back from my buddy's house where his new-to-him '73
Deluxe 7 passenger Bus was delivered today...

While cleaning out the junk and checking ID &amp; VIN#s we found some
inconsistencies that someone out there may be able to explain...

VIN# is 223, # stamped in engine compartment is 223, grey label on
driver's door jamb says DOM 09/73 (making this a '74 model year??).

Bus currently has an upright 1600 dp engine with correct euro cooling
tin (tin is stamped with VW part #, forgot to write it down).  Oil pump
is fitted for a remote oil filter and fairly large oil cooler mounted
where a gas heater or second battery would mounted on driver side under
spare tire well...

My buddy 's wants to know whether he should keep the 1600dp set-up or go
back to the stock type IV motor (we have access to a couple 2.0L
engines).

Any one have an idea what's up with the conficting DOM (date of
manufacture) and VIN#...??

Bus also has a square boxed Stewart Warner gas heater mounted behind
driver's side front seat (two unlabeled switches) that looks brand
new...  Any idea how this works...

BTW this bus was purchased from an impound lot for storage fees due and
PO is not forthcoming with any info regarding Bus.  Luckily we found a
spare key taped to back of visor as PO is being kinda of a jerk about
turning over any keys...

Nice find for $500... and another Bus saved from the crusher...

    TIA

        JonR

    Bright Orange '73 Westy &quot;JULIUS&quot;

    ps: this bus is two tone White over Bright Orange...
