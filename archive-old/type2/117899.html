Subject: crazy turn signals

K so i finally figured out and fixed the dang horn now i get to go toot toot 
yay! now the last step in making my baby street legal is dealing with the 
blinker issue, all the lights work including all the functions of the red 
tail lights, cept when i put on my turn signals they blink together like the 
hazard lights, which by the way also works.  I have decided they do it 
because the brown/white and brown wires that connect to the turn signal 
switch are cut off, correct me please if im worng. But whenever i try to 
connect those wires and then turn on the blinkers, the fuse  theyre 
connected to, (#1) not only blows but smokes and fizzles til i turn it off, 
what is happening?!?
