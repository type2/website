Subject: Re: Rear-end groaning under accelleration...confused

I just noticed the vibration last night...nothing violent, but 
definitely there.  The wheel bearings passed the &quot;wiggle the wheel&quot; 
test, so I haven't investigated that any further.  I'm going to have a 
look at the transmission fluid today, and see what's up with that.  
Maybe that'll be a clue.

BTW.  Replacing both CV axles didn't help much (although, one did have a 
leaking boot).

Any ideas on how I can test the transmission problems or broken mounts 
theories?

Thanks for the help,

Jonathan

&gt;If yes, it could also be wheel bearings, or transmission problems, or
&gt;engine/trans mounts broken etc.
