Subject: Re: [T2] Freeing up a stuck engine

I did this with my Corvair. Removed the carbs. Removed the spark plugs. Filled with light oil. Marvel Mystery Oil or auto tranny fluid or a combo of everything you've got that is oily. Released the valves so they could close (removed pushrods)

Filled the combustion chambers and the block. 

Anyhow I filled the engine up and over a week's time I went out and tried to rotate the engine by hand (breaker bar) both ways. Eventually it would rotate this way and that slightly, then more, then more and then 180 degrees, and finally all the way. Rotated it many times by hand. 

When Installed it, I rotated it a BUNCH with the starter. 30 secs bursts, never got the starter too hot. Had real oil in it at that point. Also checked th oil pressure that way.
