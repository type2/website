Subject: The joy of winter and Westies (long)

Since its Friday, I thought I'd let you in on a little experience I had this
morning.  It was -32 Celcius this morning when I went to get in my '76 Westy
to go to work.  I thought about walking because at these temperatures I
don't really like to use the vw cause its just too cold.  Anyway today I was
going to drive it.  As I enter the parking lot to go start the bus I notice
that someone has opened the unlocked engine compartment lid (why I don't
know).  I look in the compartment and everything seems to be in place.  I
get in and start up the bus.  Because its so cold, the throttle sticks, and
the engine is revving too high for my liking for just being started. I try
to reach under the gas pedal and pull on the throttle - no go, so I get out
of the bus and I'm going to see if I can adjust it in the engine
compartment.  Well, when I get outsice  I realize hey, this thing is really
revvin, I better just turn off the key. so I go to get back inside and the
door handle is frozen and I can't get back in - of course all my keys are in
ther and I have no way of getting in ( I usually keep a spare set in the
engine compartment but they are in the bus now because thats where I left
them last week after having the bus towed to get a clutch cable dreplaced).
At this point I panic and just pull of the coil wire to stop the engine,
shut the lid, and walk to work.  Great way to start the day, now I have to
get a spare set of keys couriered to me from a friend so i can get my keys
out of the bus later today.

Right now the key is in the on position, and the coil wire is pulled - is
there any harm in leaving it like this for a few hours (other than a dead
battery)?

Anyway be thankful if you don't have to live with these kind iof
temperatures.

Later, Brad
'76 frozen Westy (in the on position)
