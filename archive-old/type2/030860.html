&gt; I currently have 2 seperate keys for my 1971 Westy.  One for the ignition,

&gt; way to have all the locks (including the engine hatch lock) re-keyed to work
&gt; with a single key?

I have rekeyed mine myself, and it turned out to be quite simple.  I have
it as a FAQ that someone sent me, if the list is interested I will post it
here, otherwise let me know and I will send it directly to you.  it is
quite long.   
when finished all keys will match the ignition key, which is used as the
template (unless you want to drill out the ignition barrel?!)
