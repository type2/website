Subject: adjusting hydraulic valves?

Hi volks!

I got a question regarding the valves on my '81 vanagon, CU engine, 2.0l 
double-carb, hydraulic valves. This is the point: the valves: should I 
adjust them and how should I adjust them.

There are four suggestions, as fars as I know:
Don't do anything to the valves - one of my manuals says that.
Set them to zero clearance - remembering having read this on the list.
Set them to zero clearance and 1 turn in - remembering having read this 
on the list.
Set them to zero clearance and 2 turns in - my other manual says that.

Now I'm really confused what to do...

Thanks in advance for bringing light into the darkness...

Nick
