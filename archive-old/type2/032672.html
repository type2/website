Subject: heater booster fan kit FS [second posting]

Hi, folks: 

I've got a 12-volt dual heater fan kit from J.C. Whitney that's been
sitting in its box for quite awhile.  

The kit is missing some generic stuff you can get from the FLAPS [air
hose, hose clamps, one of the two three-speed switches, crimp connectors
etc.].

But it has the essentials: both fans, both fan housing plugs, both PVC
fittings for the end of the air hose, both 16 amp fuses and holders, AND
all directions [for Beetles and Type 2's] including photos and the cut-out
template. Note that this is not the cylindrical in-line fan that mounts in
the front defroster/heater duct; it's the matched pair that go back by the
engine.

I'm asking $75 [includes postage] for the whole thing--sorry folks, but
it'll have to be prepaid.

best
