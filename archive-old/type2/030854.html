Thanks to about a half dozen respondents who agreed with my mechanic's
diagnosis -- I replaced the points (burnt) and condenser and everything
seems OK so far after short test drive.  I'll drive it to work tomorrow
and if no problems I think it's licked.

Other suggestions included coil, dizzy advance, worn dizzy, plug wires,
and fuel pump.

I should listen to my unconscious, which output the word &quot;condenser&quot; when
this first started happening.  This is elementary auto-shop-class
stuff.  But it's probably been 20 years since I last had a condenser crap
out.

If all goes well, I'll pick up a spare set on the way home.  BTW this was
a relatively new set, on the otherwise fine SVDA dizzy I got from
aircooled_dot_net a month or so ago.

And I'll be watching that coil....

Thanks again, folks!
joe
