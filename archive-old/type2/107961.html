Subject: [T2] hyd. valves


&gt; I am getting ready to adjust my hyd. valves
&gt; I warmed up engine to operating temp before tearing down the rockers,
tubes,
&gt; seals, push rods, etc. thinking I was going to just put it back together
the
&gt; same day.
&gt; However, now it's been two weeks sitting since I found other things to do
and
&gt; had to wait on parts.
&gt; Here I am wondering if I am going to have major problems with the lifters
if
&gt; they bled down and adjusting from that point, etc.?
&gt; also, am I'm going to turn 2 full turns after contact when adjusting or 1
&gt; full turn...what is the correct turns (full or half turns) when adjusting
hyd.
&gt; valves on an engine with 60K miles on it?

If the lifters have been sitting without any load on them, i.e., the
pushrods and rockers have been out all this time, then they probably haven't
bled down to any significant extent.  If they've been sitting around with
everything installed then, yes, there's a chance that some of them will have
bled down.  But, that's no big deal.  You adjust them in the normal fashion,
putting as many &quot;turns&quot; on them after contact - or even leaving a .006 gap -
depending on your particular religion.
