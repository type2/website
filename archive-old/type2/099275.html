Subject: BN4 Heater Switch help.

Greetings O Helpful List,

I recently purchased this heater switch to use with the BN4 I
not-as-recently purchased:

  http://www.dawfun_dot_com/heaterSwitch.jpg  (I highlighted the letters
next to the terminals for clarification)

The spring timer works, so I thought I'd try hooking it up to the
heater.  The only problem is I have no clue which terminals on the
switch connect to which terminals on the heater, nor do I know which
terminals on the switch go to ground, hot-power, or switched-power.

I've looked at a number of references (including the ever-so-helpful
&quot;De-mystifying&quot; pages on type2_dot_com), but nowhere do I see this switch
discussed anywhere.

I understand it may be for a vanagon (not a Type2), but thought I'd ask
for help from youse guys first.  Either way, I'm certain it would work
out with my BN4 if I only knew how to hook it up.

Thanks in advance.  You've all been most helpful in the past.

Enjoy,

Jonathan
