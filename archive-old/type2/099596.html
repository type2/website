Subject: Re: [T2] Buses FS (CT, MA, NY Areas)

I've never bought a car up north but I'll ask this:

Is rust the big deal I hear about? Would all the busses posted likely have 
serious rust problems?

I've lived in Florida where most of the vintage cars (unrestored) had 
serious rust problems, and in Naples, IT where most of the vintage cars had 
rust problems.

Just curious....
