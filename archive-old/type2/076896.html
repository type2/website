&gt; &gt; You're absolutely right, and I'm pretty sure I read somewhere that
&gt; &gt; seatbelts have a &quot;lifespan&quot; related to the stretching caracteristics of
&gt; &gt; their material...   I think it's something like 15-20 years....  As you
&gt; &gt; mentionned a seatbelt stretches when an accident occurs, and that
&gt; &gt; stretching helps to &quot;pad&quot; the shock of the impact.
&gt;
&gt; Sunlight does 'em in too. And the stuff you spill on them, rough stuff you
&gt; might drag them across, the sand on your swimsuit after a day at the
&gt; beach...

&gt; Old paranoid Jim again: I wouldn't install used seatbelts any more than I'd
&gt; drive on used tires, sleep on a used mattress or eat used food. You're never
&gt; sure just what those things have been through. I figure that if Dale
&gt; Earnhardt could manage to break a new seat belt that's of far higher
&gt; strength than the ones we use in our Buses (5,000psi tensile strength
&gt; minimum), I'm not chancing it with a used one.

Well, new belts are certainly good, but remember that the first time you
use them they become used belts!

I have more confidence in a used genuine VW seat belt than I do in an
aftermarket belt.

Certainly, a belt from a vehicle newer than your own will be better, as
long as it hasn't been stressed in a collision.  How do you tell if it has
been stressed?  Well, I checked the vehicle that I unbolted it from!

The same belts and retractors used in late bugs was also used in later
model Audis and watercooled VWs.  You could even get them in colors.

Lefts and rights are identical, so I took belts from the passenger sides
of two Audis for my '71s front seat.
