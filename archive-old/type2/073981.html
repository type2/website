Subject: [T2] Oil leak - oil pickup bolt

&gt;When I was putting my Type IV together, the securing bolt for the oil pickup
&gt;did not seem to tighten properly, as if it was partially stripped.  I
&gt;figured I could get away with it (didn't feel like taking the case halves
&gt;apart to re-tap - probably a mistake) and finished re-assembly.

This was probably a mistake, you will more than likely
have to split the case to make the proper repair, either
a helicoil or a Time-Sert ( my favorite ) -  www.TimeSert_dot_com
This is the case bolt for the oil pick-up, not the strainer cover bolt.
