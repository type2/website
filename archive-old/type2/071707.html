Subject: Open Letter to Parts Vendors

Please don't any one take this personally.  This is meant as a 
positive reaction to some recent frustration I  (and I feel, others) 
have had.

Please Mr. or Ms. Parts Vendor:

1.  Don't lie to me.  If you're going to be dishonest, look out, I 
get mean when
     I'm mad.

2.  Don't take me for granted.  You are not the only vendor out there.

3.  Don't treat me as prey.  You may fool me once, but not twice.

4.  If you make me a promise, at least try to fulfil it.

5.  If you make a representation in you advertising or web site, abide by it.

6.  Don't make excuses for bad products or service.  I didn't ask you 
to sell me
     crap.  I judge you and your company by your product and service.

7.  Don't take on the whole world if your not prepared to service it.  Start
     small if necessary and grow within your means.   A big company that can't
     service it's clientele won't last.

8.  Anyone can offer a lower price, but the customer will remember the poor
     product or service well after the memory of price has faded.

9.  Hire the best people, train them well, and then give them the power to get
     the job done (including tools to make the customer happy and satisfied).

10. Offer me options, service, and a satisfying relationship and you'll have my
     business for life.


FOR WHAT IT IS WORTH!
