Subject: Re: [T2] Battery Tray Replacement

&gt; The battery is now on the drivers side, with a long power cable, and the 
&gt; driver's side battery tray has a BIG hole in it, almost the size of the 
&gt; battery, but not quite.  So it still had a lot of strength around the edges.

I would clean up the area real good, plop the new tray in, and weld around
the rough edges from the bottom if possible. then prime and paint.

an aside, if you don't weld and are coming by tomorrow I will weld it in
for you.
