You need to talk to David Hunt &lt;DAVIDTHEKM_at_aol_dot_com&gt;, real nice guy and he
did just what you are talking about.  David has the experience we can all
learn from.


&gt;Lastly - someone was attempting to drive a small rotary compressor for
&gt;their a/c system off of the crankshaft with the old air injection pump drive.
&gt;
&gt;Anyone know of the results?
&gt;
&gt;I won't hack my bus to install the old piston compressor. I want to mount
&gt;the rotary above the crank/fan shroud somewhere.
