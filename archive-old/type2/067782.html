&gt;One area where I screwed up was the tranny.  There is a definite

&gt;generations is, but I know I am unhappy with mine (late engine, late
&gt;tranny, early body).  *IF POSSIBLE* (and I ain't tried this), I would

&gt;Let me know what you decide and if you want an *extemely* long post on
&gt;what I remember of the procedure. 

Steve points out (correctly, having done it) that the conversion you're 
contemplating is a bit more involved than I suggested.  However, I believe 
that the transaxle difference that he is alluding to may not affect you. 
Unless I am mistaken, his '73 was the last year to use the older transaxle 
style.  If I am correct, you will need no transaxle and/or flywheel 
modification if the motor you are installing is a '75 F.I. motor, and need 
only transfer the flywheel if the motor you put in is '76-79.
