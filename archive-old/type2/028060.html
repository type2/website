 Interestingly, there was a recent wire story about how Ford Motor Co. bought a Florida recycling yard and is planning to buy many more across the US.  The intent - to establish a new business sourcing used parts for body/mechanical repair stations.  There was even a hint that Ford may buy more repair stations (like they did in the UK).  Now if only VW would get into the act.
