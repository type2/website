Subject: Broken down in Oneonta; AIRS

--part1_151.10a614c5.2a5f63f4_boundary

I received a e-mail from a kid who got my name off AIRS.  He lives in 
Philadelphia, PA and had to leave his bus in Oneonta, NY.  It is presently at 
a VW dealership, and he is trying to get information on who is reliable in 
the Oneonta area.  He says the problem is that the clutch pedal will not go 
down all of the way, and he cannot shift it into any gears while rolling.  He 
can shift through the gears with the bus off and not using the clutch, but 
wasn't able to shift it running without the clutch.  

Any information that would help him out can be sent to &quot;Bonj&quot; (Michael Bonjo) 
mbonjo_at_asidrives_dot_com.
