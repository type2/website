&gt;I've got one I'd like to see if we can nail:
&gt;I own a 70 9-passenger bus with NO walkthrough, green paint to the
&gt;roofline, grey interior. NO spare tire well in back (so where did 
&gt;it go?).

Bench seat model baywindow buses store the spare under the front 
seat and the rear deck is flat all the way across.

&gt;The tag on the back hatch reads SALINA, which I used to think was the
&gt;dealer name.  HOWEVER... recently, two other buses moved here (austin) 
&gt;that are EXACT duplicates, and they have the same plate. I refuse to 
&gt;believe that ONE dealership specialized in green 9 seaters, and we all 
&gt;just happened to move here.

Mere coincidence.  Or maybe you were all abducted by aliens and 
implanted with a microchip that led you to Austin before your final 
gathering in Roswell, NM.  Or perhaps you all visited the same voo-doo 
lounge in New Orleans and are being psychicly willed to move to Austin.
Or MAYBE...

Dave
