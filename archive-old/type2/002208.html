Folks,

Please excuse a dumb question from a newbie.

There are two hoses going to each rear wheel
on my 78 bus. Once is clearly a brake hose. I know that
because it leaked brake fluid when I changed it this weedend.

(A very short metal brake line connects the brake hose to the 
rear wheel).

What is the other?
