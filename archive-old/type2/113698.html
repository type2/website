Subject: Re: [T2] Overhead AC

&gt;The AC units installed back then were all aftermarket units--it just
&gt;depended on who got the job of installing them. ( and by afterarket I
&gt;mean they wern't istalled at the factory--they were installed either by
&gt;the dealer or an outside source, as per the customer's order )
&gt;
&gt;i kinda like the look of the underdash unit too--looks real nice,
&gt;matches the dash---
&gt;BUT--forget ever adding a parcel tray--the AC unit kinda absorbs this
&gt;area pretty good--:&gt;(

How about dual a/c - one coil over the back and under the dash too. There 
is a guy on the Corvair list with a Corvair van and he has done exactly 
that - dual air with dual blowers. Seen the pics and he did a nice job. 
Basically used a solenoid to open and close flow to the rear coils. Was 
either triggered by a pressure switch or thermostat. I have the details 
someplace.
