Subject: Re: GL5/Synthetics

Sorry about that, let me clarify. I use a Redline product which is GL-5/GL-4 
rated. Your right, it is not straight GL-5, but most GL-5 synths are 
multi-rated, and the yellow metal problems seem to have been worked out, if 
the manufactures are not lying to us. ( Don't think they would, or their 
respective legal dept.s would have said &quot;No way&quot;, in this age of instant 
litigation) I guess it goes to show that everyone can have a different 
experiance. Mine was positive, sorry yours wasn't. Old ideas can be hard 
habbits to break, and most of the time, technology is our friend.
Just an opinion folks
