Subject: disassembling/reassembling front door

I will be disassembling the door ('71) to install a complete door seal kit and
also to renew the locks. I have been reading Bentley's procedures and think I
understand most of the steps. What I don't understand is the following:
  1.. When does the felt run channel (across top and rear of window) get
removed in relation to the other steps?
  2.. How is it removed? I pulled an inch or so back to see the top vent screw
and it was *very* hard to move (I destroyed the part that I pulled back - but
I will be replacing it anyway).
  3.. Conversely, when and how is this same felt run channel installed?
  4.. It appears that the window glass has to be removed entirely to be able
to replace the scrapers. Is this true?
Sincerely,
Bill Moon
