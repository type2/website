Subject: Re: what is it..(Window size).??

Clara writes small back windows went on into 63. OK so the larger window
actually came into production on Aug 1 1963 from chassis 1 144 282...but in
 UK terms the number of 63's with lil windows is so minimal...but obvious clues
like indicators (bullets or fish eye) rear window, bumper shape egdes, push
button cab door handles size/ position of loading door hinges etc are immediate
visual starting points to begin dating...provided of course the bus is still
original!
Clearly accurate dating comes from the chassis plates......
