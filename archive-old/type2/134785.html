&gt; if the light can't get in air sure isn't, or at least not enough to
&gt; matter.

So you shouldn't see any light, or just a bit between the edges of the tin?

Using this test, I'd swear that I can see more light with the new engine
than with the old one.  Especially on either side through the holes where
the heater widgets go through the tin.  Not good?
