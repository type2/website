Fuel pressure is in spec, valve lash correct, timing dead on, and is =
correct throughout the range.

Tuned up my van the other day, found my timing to be a little too =
advanced........the van WAS running fine, great mph, temps in spec, =
etc., but set it back to Bentley manual specs.  7.5 BTDC at idle, right =
around 40 total advance.

Auxiliary air reg is fine........tested in refrigerator and watched it =
warm up and close..........

When I start the van, cold engine, the idle is around 400rpm.  The =
adjustment screw on the throttle body is almost all the way out to =
achieve this.........If i crank this screw inward, the van will die.  =
After about 5 minutes of driving, the idle is around 800 and all is =
well, except one thing

When I pull off from a stop light, or stop.I have no power at all.once =
the rpms go over 2000 it starts pulling real good......I had a stop =
light at the base of a steep hill....I had to roll back and get a run to =
get up it! =20

My head temp sensor is a year old, but plan on changing that........Does =
not appear to be any vac leaks....went around the running engine and =
tested with brake clean



Any ideas form those that have seen this would be appreciated.
