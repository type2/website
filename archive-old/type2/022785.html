&lt;&lt; I'm looking for the &quot;tallest&quot; gear ratio I can find without installing 
a  Porsche tranny. &gt;&gt;

Currently the tallest that I am aware of is a .70 gearset.  Combined
with the 4.86 ring and pinion of the '76 and a 26&quot; tire at 3,000 rpm
you're cruising a bit over 68 mph.  With the same tires and rpm but
with a stock 4th its 10mph slower-58mph.

&lt;&lt; Will a Vanagon 4 or preferably, 5 speed fit into my 76 Westy 
without too much hassle? &gt;&gt;

Whats your definition of hassle?  I'd say 'no' offhand.

&lt;&lt;I'm willing to modify mounts and linkages if necessary. &gt;&gt;

There'd be plenty of that!  For the average owner with the normal
tool set and lack of previous experience in swapping in something
like this then I would say that the hassle factor is pretty high.
Costwise it'd probably be cheaper to regear the stock 091 trans
than to purchase and retrofit a 091-1 gearbox into the Baywindow.
