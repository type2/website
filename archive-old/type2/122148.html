Subject: RE: [T2] PC in Bus

When running these things put in an accessory batter and relay.
It's pretty simple and if you run it right down and really aren't to 
concerned
with space you can even bring along a battery charger (small thing) for when
your next to a plug in.

If your not so worried about a pc part.. another idea is a modded xbox.
Play DVD's, PS1, mame whatever... divx, mpegs movies games.. You can easily
pick up a 15&quot; tft screen and a converter box to make it accept rca signals
for cheap. Plug in a larger hard drive and now your have got room for 100's 
of
divx movies and games and no hassle of carrying the actual dvd's to get 
scratched
on your trips.

And I have an ibook now too. So im not carrying around a pc anymore (only at 
home
and work).

&gt;My Camper bus is getting a complete entertainment center, with the possible 
&gt;inclusion of a HTPC/Carputer/MAME machine. Plus, using a 15&quot; LCD monitor is 
&gt;cheaper than a 7&quot; or larger TV display.
&gt;
&gt;Don't think you absolutely have to use a laptop in your bus. After all, 
&gt;you've got room to spare. Built into one of the cabinets in my bus, we can 
&gt;lay down in the bed and watch DVDs, the kids can play PS2 or emulator games 
&gt;on the MAME box, etc. Plus with wireless, just pull up near a hotspot and 
&gt;get free internet access!
&gt;
&gt;Now, I'm concerned about the low amps my alt puts out. I was spoiled with 
&gt;my truck that put out 150amps. What's the stock alt in a '73, like 50amps? 
&gt;Then there's the drop due to 30 year old wiring and we're talking problems.
