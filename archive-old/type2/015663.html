&gt;I know the jetting question has circulated already but I am still a bit
&gt;confused.  I have a '73 bus with dual carbs 34-PDSIT-2/3's.  The engine
&gt;fan says its a AW, but the engine is a new 2000cc with 1800 heads.  

That is EXACTLY the setup I have, although I will be switching to 72 heads
(39mm intakes vs. 41mm) soon.  I believe the 41 intake valves are way too
large for the stock carbs. 

&gt;The
&gt;manual say this about the dual carb series of busses
&gt;
&gt;year	disp	main jet	air correc	pilot
&gt;1972	1700	137.5		155		55
&gt;1973CB	1700	137.5		140		55
&gt;1973CD	1700	132.5		155		50
&gt;1974	1800	130		175		52.5
&gt;
&gt;I think mine is
&gt;1973	2000	XXX		XXX		XX
&gt;
&gt;can someone help me get an idea of jet sizes for the 2 liter?
&gt;thanks.

That is EXACTLY the setup I have.  Originally I ran 130 mains and 155 air
correction with the stock venturis.  This ran slightly lean at sea level.
Tried 137.5 mains and they were way rich.  I think 132.5 would be about
perfect unless you live at elevation, in which case I'd use the 130's or
possibly even 127.5.

Last year I bored the venturis out from 26 to 29mm and went to 142.5 mains
and 155 air correction.  This is also a bit on the lean side at sea level -
I will be upping the mains to 145 next time I have the carbs out.

I should mention that I don't know much about the function of the air
correction jets, and chose 155 because it was the middle of the available
range.  For pilot jets I've always used 55, tried 60 recently and they
seemed a bit rich so I put the 55's back in.
