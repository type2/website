&gt;My question is this: I noticed that my '74 Bus has A/C.

&gt;their buses?

You shouldn't worry about it - you can leave it disconnected and it won't hurt anything.  I have working A/C on my '73.  Wasn't the easiest job to get it working again after 11 years (at least) of non-operation, but it is doable.
