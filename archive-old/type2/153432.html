Subject: Fw: [T2] Testing a Fuel Injection harness??

Karl:

After posting I went back to my testing and discovered that I had continuity
at the resistor pack connection.  So, you're correct.  However, the Bentley
says the terminals for the FI connectors are 88e, 88b and 88f, which are
identified on the dual relay as such.  Is this a Bentley error, or am I
reading things wrong?

Thanks.

 Are you sure you aren't supposed to go to the plug to
 the resister pack??
