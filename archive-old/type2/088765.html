Subject: Re: [T2] New Fuel Pump &quot;WOW&quot;

they don't put out too much fuel, they can have too much pressure!

You drop the fuel pressure by adding gaskets between the pump and spacer,
until you are at 3.5psi. Interestingly enough, many of the aftermarket pump
spacers (the bakelite piece) are THINNER then the originals, which when
installed instantly kicks your fuel pressure over the threshold of &quot;properly
operating pressure&quot;. Another instance of an aftermarket part creating
problems if you aren't paying attention.
