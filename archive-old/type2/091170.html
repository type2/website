&gt; How much of a job is it to replace a steering box on a 71 bus?
&gt;
&gt; Should I go with a new Brazilian box or a rebuilt one from BusBoy?
&gt;
&gt; Any other parts should I have on hand when changing the box?

Hardest thing is getting the pitman arm off.  it is on a tapered spline
and the nut is often overtightened.  Squirt a lot of penetrating oil on
the splines, use a pitman arm puller, and brush up on your blue
vocabulary.

As far as source, I've been using a junkyard box with good success.
