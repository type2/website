Thanks to all who responded to my post about the exhaust dilemma with the
air-cooled California models. The crossover is know longer available from
the dealer or anywhere else. I am leading towards switching over to federal.
Include the cat but seal off the EGR. I'll have to mount the O2 sensor
somewhere where the two legs come together. I will also most likely go with
BusDepot for parts. We do not have emissions testing here in Billings,
Montana. Mostly do to the pollution from 3 refineries, Billings is exempt
from any Federal law. If you live here it's like being a smoker whether you
want to or not. That plus I will be relocating in the near future.....

Thanks again

&gt;Hey John, what are you using for your exhaust system? I'm gonna have to
&gt;replace mine in the near future and one of the pieces I would be needing is
&gt;the crossover which I can't find anywhere. Another option is to swtich it
&gt;over to federal, but where do I insert the O2 sensor and what would I do
&gt;with the EGR? No direct answers from Bus Depot or VW dealer. Any options?
