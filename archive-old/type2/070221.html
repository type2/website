&gt;Hoping to get some recommendations on the type of
&gt;compresson tester to buy.
&gt;
&gt;Cylinders 1 and 3 are a bugger to get to in my
&gt;74 bus, so I was thinking longgggg hose would
&gt;be nice.  Sears has one 29.00, short hose,
&gt;screws in, not sure I can screw it in the holes
&gt;with the engin tin in the way.
&gt;
&gt;Any thoughts?

&quot;Someone&quot; (don't remember who; maybe Sears) has a model that the hose is
in two pieces on.  One piece is really just a solid metal adapter about the
size of a sparkplug.  You screw it in using a sparkplug wrench, then the
actual hose part (with the gauge) snaps onto it like an air hose on a shop
tool.  The next one I buy will probably be like that.

I say, my Craftsman (i.e. Sears) compression tester has one short hose, about 6&quot;
long I think that threads into the spark plug hole, and longer one that attaches
to the shorty using an air hose coupling.  I seem to remember using this one on
my type IV engine, and use it every time I pull the plugs on my upright engine
in Sunshine.  Seem to remember it being nearly impossible to use on my wife's 
piece of cr*p Mustang with a V6, but it is very easy to use on Sunshine, my '64
Camper.

Don't get the one piece kind, it's a total pain to get a seal.

Good luck,
terry
