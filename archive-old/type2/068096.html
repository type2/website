Nice post, except for the following part.
&gt; Drive with your headlights on at all times on dirt roads.  I drive with my
&gt; high beams on during the day.  The point of this is to make yourself as
&gt; visible as possible.

PLEASE DON'T DO THIS.

Think of what you do when a vehicle has their high beams on comes 
towards you. You turn your eyes away from the BRIGHT light.  
Guess what, NOT looking at someone means that they are invisible!

Bright lights are NOT for making yourself visible to others, they're 
for making the road visible to you.

Using your bright lights to become MORE visible backfires and makes 
you INVISBLE.
