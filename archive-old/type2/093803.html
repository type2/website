Subject: Re: [T2] one more time...shift mechanism housing...

The front buffer is to help align for shifting. however the first and 
second gear shifting would be hitting the other guide.  I believe you 
are concentrating on one piece when shifting problems can come from more 
than one location.  you have a linkage in the middle and more at the 
rear at the transmission.  Check the bushings at the rear (at the 
transmission).
