Subject: Re: [T2] Poptop seen in snowbusses site

Thanks for that info Martin, that Devon roof style is hard to tell apart from a
Dormobile unless it is seen in the up position,

Devon also had the version that only the flat top when up, and left a frame on
the roof, I saw one in Ottawa this year,, and it was the same as Pg 83 in the
book, VW Bus, the first 50 years. They call it a Eurovette

That is the style I was familiar with until I read the rest of that page, which
shows a Devon Moonraker with that same style top as Tony's Camper on Rob's page


One question I have while searching the net for pics to compare,, I found Dom
Coll's page and it shows a Devon version that looks like a Dormobile?

What do you think?

&gt; Not a guess but i can tell you that its a Devon(as in J.P.White of
&gt; Sidmouth,Devon England)pop-top on my friend Tony's camper-most definately
&gt; not a dormy roof as they were made by Martin Walters and were side
&gt; hinged-this one goes straight up(ie bellows all round the fibre glass top
&gt; with cantelever springs puushing it up from the inside).This type of roof is
&gt; reallky common in England and has two folding bunks inside-Martin
