Subject: Re: What are &quot;Deadhead stickers&quot;? -Reply

I consider a &quot;Deadhead sticker&quot;  one that relates to the Grateful Dead.  I
have a big fat Grateful Dead Steal Your Face with a VW on the front of
my bus on the tire cover and the condition of my bus would be at least
an eight on a scale of ten.  There is nothing I would rather do then travel
in my camper and jam Grateful Dead bootlegs.  Although many stickers
can junk up a vehicle, with a little planning and taste they can help
personalize your ride.
Peace, Love, Annapolis &amp; the Grateful Dead
