&gt; Basically, on thesamba, we were just trying to figure out a way to  
&gt; put a
&gt; table outside the bus, and have it be stable.
&gt; I took some ideas from that thread and sketched out some ideas. I gave
&gt; the drawings and specs to an experienced welder (and Bus owner) and he
&gt; hooked it up for me!

Very inventive. Great job.
