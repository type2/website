Subject: Re: [T2] GEX Engine (2)


Too many unfamilar with the facts think that because you can swap some VW 
parts and get a way with it, you can mix and match any assemblage of parts 
that might be at hand. Afterall, VW's are supposed to be cheap, so whatever 
process is cheapest is OK. That's the way GEX assembles engines and is why 
there are so many short milage problems with them.

&gt;Ref. the earlier post I made regarding the bus that my friend bought.
&gt;
&gt;Forgot to mention something found:
&gt;
&gt;The engine is a 1600 DP engine with the generator mount plate that bolts 
&gt;to the fan shroud being the one designed for the longer bus generator.
&gt;
&gt;GEX (I presume) installed the shorter style generator.
&gt;
&gt;Hence ............. The pulleys do not line up.
