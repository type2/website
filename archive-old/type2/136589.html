Subject: Re: Need Tent Instructions

There's a couple of places online you can look:

I have a few of the Westfalia manuals scanned in (1968, 1973 and 1974; the rest are links to other
websites with scanned in manuals) and posted on my website at:

http://www.geocities_dot_com/thegreatjose/VW/69bus.html

Click on the &quot;1968 Westfalia Owner's Manual&quot; and then click on pages 16 &amp; 17.

I think most of the manuals have the instructions on how to put up the tent so you might want to
flip through all of them.

The Samba (http://thesamba_dot_com/vw/) has quite a few manual scans (as well as a bunch of other
stuff) available if you click on the &quot;Technical&quot; tab at the top, and then click on &quot;Manuals&quot; (the
&quot;Archives&quot; tab is also a neat place to look, as a bunch of old VW advertising literature has been
scanned in).

Rob's Baywindow bus site (http://www.baywindowbus_dot_com) also has quite a few manuals and literature
scanned in for your enjoyment as well.
