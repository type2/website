Looks like I put too much white-out in that last e-mail. My question relative to this topic was:

Did the 72-on buses use a brake booster similar to the 71's? The reason I'm curious is because it would reason that a '71-only manifold would then be required if you retrofit a Type II engine into a later bus.

Thansk! Joe
