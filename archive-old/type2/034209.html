I reckon you have to remove the engine and transmission as one, then split
them once they are well clear of the bus. Am I right in thinking your van
has the removeable rear valence, therefore making the prospect of drivetrain
removal much nicer (no need to raise the rear of the van high, to get the
engine under the bumper)?

&gt; Folks,
&gt;
&gt; Okay, I'm thinking about removing my transmission myself.  For some that
&gt; might not be a big deal; for me it might be a major undertaking.  I have
the
&gt; Bentley book.  Can anyone out there give me a more simple set of
&gt; instructions?  Do I have to remove the engine and tranny to remove the
&gt; transmission?
&gt;
&gt; Thanks,
