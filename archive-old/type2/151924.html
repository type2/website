&gt; A collapsing lifter usually reveals itself by sound. If one of your lifters

know the sound and don't have it,  couple seconds at startup but nothing
else and it has almost always done that.

&gt; Could be several things causing the trouble. I don't remember what year your
&gt; bus is but if you have fuel injection, next time it happens try pulling the
&gt; leads off the injectors just like you tried the spark plugs. This will rule

78, and I have pulled the plugs on the injectors too. when I did the plugs
also did the injectors.

&gt; in/out the fuel system. If this reveals nothing I would try putting a set of
&gt; good points in the dizzy. I don't know about Pertronix but I had a hall
&gt; sensor in a Puik (oops, Buik) cause similar symptoms before failing

hmmm,  have heard that Pertronix either work or don't nothing in between.
but I guess I could check always carry a spare set of points,  but
wouldn't it have problems at speed not at idle????   that is the part that
doesn't make sense.

&gt; entirely. A Sun engine analizer showed that the electronic ignition was
&gt; failing to spark random cylinders at random times. Hard to diagnose without
&gt; a scope that's capable of tracing the spark for all cylinders at the same
&gt; time. Points are cheaper than a scope and will prove the point. Um, was that
&gt; a pun? :~)

duh!  pun or no probably a good idea
