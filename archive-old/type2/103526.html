&gt;So just a reminder to double check those latches+ACEAIQAh-
&gt;
&gt;We had a parts bus a friend and I named +ACI-Shasta+ACI- because on the tow home its
&gt;pop top latches broke and the top pop open like a soda can. After that I
&gt;have always double checked and use a small safety rope around the latches.

I guess some strong rubber straps around the hinged supports at the sides would be a good idea also.
