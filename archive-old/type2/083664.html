&gt; &gt;Hello again.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;I have been considering replacing the air filter box on my fuel injected
&gt; &gt;type4 with a more modern &quot;performance&quot; air filter style. The kind you see
&gt; &gt;on those K&amp;N intake kits.
&gt; &gt;&lt;snip&gt;
&gt; &gt;Can anyone think of why this would be a bad idea. I know these L-Jetronic
&gt; &gt;systems can be fussy when you alter the way they work (even if very
&gt; &gt;slightly).
&gt;
&gt; I think a better course of action would be to find a K&amp;N panel filter that
&gt; fits in the stock airbox.  You get all of the benefits and none of the risk
&gt; of going with the conical filter.  Been There, Done That.  Won't do it again.

The K&amp;N filter discussion can become a religious argument, but here's my 2
cents.

I used and liked K&amp;N filters when I was racing motorcycles off-road.  The
big selling point of these filters was that they wouldn't clog up, which
would lead to a DNF (and no $$$)  From that standpoint they worked great.

We were willing to allow a certain amount of fine particulate to pass
through the filter in return for the anti-clogging action.  The K&amp;N media
is thin, has large pores, and vibrates, all of which means that it will
pass fine dust.  On the 2-stroke motorcycles we rode, we usually bought
pistons by the 6-pack anyway, so the wear didn't concern us too much.

Now, on my bus, I would not run the K&amp;N.  I don't need the anti-clog
property, and I am concerned about fine particulates getting into the
engine.  Better to use a filter that does a better job on all particles,
and it's hard to improve on the stock item.
