Would anyone be interested in a 70 westy for $500 obo?
It is pretty solid has a running motor , it is a front bench with a full
sink 12v fridge ,stove and a flip up bar. Ive never seen this before but it
is westy made.
unfortunatly the passenger front has been hit . It looks as if it could be
pulled out  but the passenger door is stuck for now.
It has no bed but those are cake to find and it is titled as a 71 but still
has the 70 plates.

located in Franklin NC
