This might make you feel better &lt;knock on wood&gt; My very worn out 2.0 L
w/ hyd lifters. I have 216k miles on this one &amp; it's getting very
close to rebuild time. but I usually run 240 degrees F just running
down the i-state at 65. I usually see temps approaching 260F when
idling in traffic. &amp; also have low oil pressure. This engine has run
me from TN to both Everybus &amp; HCBF &amp; everyday 80 miles round trip. So
I just accept the fact it runs hot &amp; w/ low pressure, but it's worn
out as well, I would't think twice tomorrow about driving across
country in it. Just have to watch it. &amp; make sure I do as much
maintenance as possible. :) good luck &amp; have fun on the honeymoon
trip.
