Subject: Re: [T2] Rewiring A Bus/Smoking Wiring Trouble


I doubt you have 'the bus from hell'.  Its just that your wiring has gone 
there.  These vehicles are OLD.  The wiring scheme is logical in theory, 
just not in practice 20 or 30 years later!  I have thought of using a 
late-model VW fuse panel to rework the system using relays, but the early 
bays require too much customization IMHO to do the swap.

Has anybody ever rewired their bus completely?  I am beginning to think that 
the stock wiring layout is not so good.  Twice I have had smoke coming from 
the wires.  Today after finally getting a rebuilt engine running something 
went wrong with the starter and the wires under the dash started smoking.  
Now everything is wasted.   I am thinking about tearing all the wires out 
and redoing it all in a more repair-friendly fashion.  It looks to me like 
the main hot wire leading from the rear up to the dash is about 1/2 the size 
it should be.  Also it appears that there were no fusible links or anything 
on the wires.  Is there any reason why a guy couldn't just run the wires 
along the floor inside the cabin or along the ceiling in a pipe?  I notice 
the the wires are exposed at some points underneath, that can't be good.  I 
have the bus from Hell.  GW
