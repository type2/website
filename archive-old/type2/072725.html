Subject: FI Altitude Compensator?
Message-Id: &lt;v01540b01b325a34281f2_at_[207.224.205.111]&gt;

When I bought my 77 bus it had a toggle switch attached to the end of the
bracket on the control unit.  This was maked &quot;High and Low&quot;. Over the years
the original switch has rattled into oblivian, so I replaced it with a
hardware store toggle.  I'm wondering if this could be part of my rich
mixture problem.  Any wisdom as to what this is or was for?  Was this a
form of a Altitude compensator with the actual resistance windings in the
control Unit?  My owners manual had no info on it nor does my Bentley
mention it.  I pulled the  Bosch L-jetronic workshop manual off the web
last night and it shows the Altitude compensator as a option and gives test
values for it and show the wiring diagram.

Any one else up in the ozone layer have either a switch or the actual
compensator on their bus?

Thanks
