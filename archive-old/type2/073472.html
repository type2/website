OKAY, I'VE GOTTEN ABOUT TEN REPLIES TO THIS MESSAGE, SO I GUESS IT'S TIME
TO USE THE CAPS LOCK KEY.

THIS IS NOT MY BUS, I DON'T HAVE ANY INFORMATION ABOUT IT, DON'T CONTACT ME
ABOUT IT.  CONTACT THE OWNER - HIS PHONE NUMBER IS IN THE MESSAGE.

I'm angry at myself for getting angry over this, after all it's the holiday
season and we are all supposed to be friends here.  In my defense, it's
very annoying when a person goes out of their way to help fellow
listmembers out by passing on a good deal and then so many people will not
even take the time to read the message carefully before hitting the reply
key.  I know I'm not the first one to experience this either.

PLEASE folks, read the message carefully and reply to the proper person.
It's not that difficult.  Otherwise, I suspect that interesting deals like
this are going to stop making it to the list.  I would be as upset about
this as anyone since someday one of them will be in my back yard.

-David

p.s. Thanks to the one person who realized his mistake and took the time to
correct it.

&gt;needs one jalousie and front turn signal. solid bus, no title, should get
