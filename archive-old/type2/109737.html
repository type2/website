Subject: distributor exchange headaches

Hi list, the names Valentin Decker and I'm more or less new here. My 
dad and I have been working on his bus ('75) recently and after 
replacing a lot of wear items we happened upon what was wrong with the 
car. The centrifugal advance had rusted itself in the 10 degree advance 
position, which had obviously made the car run a lot worse when we 
tried to set the timing correctly. 

Anyway, we ordered a rebuilt distributor from a somewhat local VW parts 
store. The part numbers were very different from the one we had 
originally (according to oldvolkshome it's a 72-73 Bug dizzy). The 
advance is very off. The bus won't pull until 3000 rpm (measured with 
our cheapo inductive tach/dwell meter). Also, the total advance is 
about an inch off the scale so I'd estimate something like 45-50 deg at 
4500 rpm. 

We got the old core back from the Donsco and it seems like the springs 
in the centrifugal advance are not right. In the old distributor, the 
springs were different, one stronger than the other (they were 
obviously different looking as well). In the rebuilt one, the springs 
are the same in strength and appearance. That makes sense because they 
are too strong to allow the advance to work at low rpms. At high rpms 
they allow the advance to go too far because of the geometry of the 
spring holders. (all right, it doesn't make perfect sense, but a 
little, maybe??). 

Donsco said all their rebuilt dizzies come in the 113... type I case. 
It did however come with the dual vacuum can (I forgot to mention it's 
stock '75 westy, I'll toss that in above). 

A few other things weren't quite right with the original dizzy either, 
it advanced one cylinder more than the other 3 and when we took it out, 
a few washers broke, so that's why my dad sprung for the 'new' part. 
Also, I'm planning on leaving this weekend for a 2 week trip with 
friends and it'd be best to not have to do this kind of work by the 
side of the road. Thanks in advance (pun?) for your help.

Valentin
