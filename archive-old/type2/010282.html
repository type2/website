Hi folks,

I just finished installing new 1/4&quot; wood paneling on my 68 Westy. You can
view the original at people.ne.mediaone_dot_net/matthew. I haven't completely
updated the page, so there may be a few blank pages. Also, I decided to keep
everything, so nothing on that site is for sale. (my financial position has
improved).

Anyway, my interior wood panels were so deteriorated from water damage that
they literally fell apart when I took them out of the camper. I had sold my
roommate a 71 Westy and he had used his old ratty panels as &quot;templates&quot; for
new ones. He used a nice aqua paterned shower board. He traced out the lines
of the old panels onto the new ones. He used masking tape on the surface of
the new panels and traced his outline onto the tape. This kept the wood from
splintering and the edges clean while he cut with a scroller saw with a
fresh blade. The result was a nice custom panel which he matched his
interior to.

I thought, heh I can do that! So I pulled out my old panels. They were
almost too far gone to use as templates. I bought 2 1/4&quot; x 4 x 8' birch
panels that had a nice grain flow on them from an HQ that is going out of
business. They were $18 each. I cut the panels using the tape. Cleaned up
the edges using a palm sander. Used the old panels as templates again for
drilling the various screw and clip holes. Brought them outside and trial
installed them, checking to see that the holes lined up. Most of them did.
Some of the screw holes I redrilled using a small drill bit and retaining
all of the original screws. I also cleaned, sanded and used Extend on some
small areas where surface rust was just beginning.

I palm sanded the plywood to a nice smooth surface and tack ragged, using
just a little denatured alchohol on the rag. (trying not to raise the grain
on the panels.)

I used House Beautiful Cedar colored, semi-transparent stain. Two coats.
Applied 1 coat, let sit 15 minutes, wipe off.

Let them dry overnight.

I installed them in my van starting with the drivers side panel that the
table attaches to. Not all of my screw holes lined up, but I found if I took
a small nail and fished around, I could locate the original holes and line
up the panel. When some of the holes were too far off, I simply re-drilled
using a small bit. Then, I did the rear hatch. I ran into a problem when I
found that the chrome topped panel clips were meant for 1/8&quot; plywood, sooo I
used one on each of the four corners of the panel to center it, clamped the
panel using a large wood clamp on the panel and over the outside of the
hatch. With my panel centered and immobilized, I took some flat headed
screws that I pulled from an 81 Westy's top and strategically predrilled
about 6 new holes and installed these flat top screws to hold the panels.
Then, I took the remaining chrome clips and inserted them into their
respective holes. They stay in nicely, as the 1/4 wood provides a perfect
mating surface for the clip, but they are now just for show.

I used the same technique on the slider.

What a great result!!!!!!!!
My van looks awesome! I no longer am depressed looking at the originals that
were just pealing away and falling apart. I think the additional thickness
will help reduce the noise level in the van. This is as close to stock I
could come without searching for the next gazzilion years trying to find
suitable panels. I couldn't find any 1/8&quot; panels anywhere.  And yes, I am
keeping the old panels, not because I may sell the bus, but because I am
anal. I have all the original parts to this bus, so that it may be restored,
BONE stock. I just want it functional for my own personal use.

Ok, Ok, I am no longer a lurker.
