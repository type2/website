&gt;   OTOH, when you are cruising, those &quot;vents&quot; as you call them are

True, but there really won't be much pressure without the engine seal.
That's a lot of real estate exposed to the outside air, which other people
have pointed out is also pressurized (under the vehicle).

&gt;And again, these engines simply do not overheat
&gt;at idle.

Granted.  But if your engine ever gets hot and you let it idle to cool
down, you will be waiting a long time.

&gt;Besides which, heat radiation being what it is, I sincerely
&gt;doubt there a heck of lot of difference in the temp above the rear tin
&gt;and below it. Some, but not much, not after running awhile, and the tin
&gt;gets hot.

I can promise you that the amount of heat that radiates through the tin is
miniscule compared to the amount of heat that is carried by the air that
rushes in through the unsealed crack and gets sucked into your fan.

&gt; very dangerous for the motor.  My oil temp runs about 130 degrees over
&gt;the
&gt;&gt; outside air temperature with a sealed engine compartment.  If my engine
&gt;
&gt;   Mine's about the same -- and I don't have the rear tin in place.

Do you have a 4100lb bus?  Do you live in Dallas?  Do you ever drive your
bus long enough or fast enough to really heat it up?  Your oil temp may not
be too hot but your CHT seems high.  500?  Mine has never seen anywhere
near that temperature, even when I had the sender mounted at the spark plug.

&gt;    Doubt TX is much hotter than Mobile, and my machine was fine all
&gt;last summer.

Did you have 29 straight days over 100 degrees recently?  We did.  I drove
my bus every day during that heat wave.  I was hot but my engine was cool.
