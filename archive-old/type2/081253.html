Subject: RE: [T2] Blue print to make childrens bed...

	No, I did not really get an answer to this.  What I was looking
for was maybe some blueprints from people that were forced to make their
own cot, because this is what I will have to do.  Was also looking for
certain tips on design that I may not think of.  Guess I will stick with
a piece of cardboard for a template and go from there.  Not really sure
how to go about this.  Thanks,

&gt; Hello all,
&gt;             At EB I saw a lot of people that had made a bed that layed

&gt; on top of the dashboard and hung off the seatbelt connectors for the 
&gt; back.  As I plan on doing the camping thing a lot more, I would like 
&gt; to make one of these.  Unfortunatley I was unable to get any pictures 
&gt; of those that I saw at EB and am not sure exactly how to rig something

&gt; like this.  Any help?
