I'll go out on a limb and guess that the exhaust differences have to do
with catylitic converts and other smog related devices.

I'll add my comments to the mix...

I like the idea.  On a bug the FI seems a little bit crammed in there,
but
with a bus it would seem OK to manage.

All new VW's in Mexico are sold this way as I understand it.  Also the
guys
in the UK who are getting Brazilian Type2's are also getting them with
1600cc FI engines (see the Devon camper report from a couple of weeks
back).

Which leads to an observation... the systems are still being produced! 
I've
already written http://www.beetlemex_dot_com/ to see if he has any idea of a
FI
system can be purchased on a &quot;turn key longblock&quot; -- like what they sell
in
the cars.

At what price would a new FI system be worth the investment?  Say $1000
for
a complete system (without heads)?  Obviously there is a pretty good
increase in MPG, and you have to also consider that a new 34-pict3 is
around
$150 too...

One question:  As I understand it the, the later bugs had different heat
exchangers.  Was this design change to accommodate FI system or for some
other reason?  I know you need different mufflers for FI, is there a
suitable one with FI accommodations that would fit on a '63-71 bus?
