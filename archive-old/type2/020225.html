Subject: fog lights

I just purchased a pair of fog lights for my bus from carparts _dot_com they
are the 4'' chrome ones from J F manufacturing and i found them to be
virtually identical to the original style accessory fog lights available
from vw just thought i'd share this in case anyone was looking for fog
or driving lights for their bus but didn't want to compromise a stock
appearance.  oh yeah they were only $16 bucks each, sealed beam 4 &quot;'
diameter and about 2 inches deep
