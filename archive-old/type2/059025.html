&gt; I just heard that letting a bus sit with the ignition switch on, but
without the engine running (listening to the radio, etc) can burn up
your points!?
&gt; 
&gt; Can anybody confirm this?

If the points are just barely making contact when the engine stops,
you can indeed damage them.  If they are fully closed, you can get a
very hot coil, as current will flow continuously through it.


&gt; Is replacing the points a tough thing to do? Anybody got any helpful
hints?

Nope, it's fairly easy to do.  You should have the new points in hand
before starting, and have a set of feeler gages handy to do the
initial point adjustment.

It is _much_ easier to replace the points if you take the distributor
out of the engine.  Pop the cap, loosen the clamp bolt, disconnect the
wire from the coil to the distributor, and pull the distributor
straight out.

The distributor only goes back into the engine one way.  Turn the
rotor until the eccentric coupler drops into its groove.  Reconnect
the wire, put the cap back on, and then set dwell and timing.
