Subject: Oil Pressure Drop

The last two weeks in Ohio have been very cool.  I have noticed that the 71
1600 DP will start at about 40 oil PSI, and after warming say 40 miles, it
will drop to about 30 PSI.  What I am concerned about is that after a while,
the temp will get say 240 and the PSI drops to 20 +.  What do I need to
troubleshoot?

Respectfully,
