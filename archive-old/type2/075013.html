Subject: Re: [T2] Advice neaded,

There is a book called something like &quot;where to camp for $5 or less&quot; or
something like that.  A bus camper from up north had one at a campout I was
at last summer and it was really full of places from every state, a good
investment, check your local bookstore.

&gt; Hi Folks,
&gt; 
&gt; I will be  taking a trip across the U.S.A  and Canada  at the end of
&gt; February . I live in Quebec
&gt; Canada near the Vermont border. I would like to drive south to Florida
&gt; first, then across to California
&gt; then up the west coast to Vancouver Canada and back to Quebec.
&gt; 
&gt; This being  my first long trip in my 1975 newly restored  Westy. I
&gt; would really appreciate it  if
&gt; any of you experienced folks would give me advice as to where I could
&gt; camp cheaply while on the road, (newly retired couple) and what to look
&gt; for as far as security
&gt; 
&gt; I am quite comfortable with the possible mechanical problem since I
&gt; spent the last 2 years
&gt; restoring the van. I also am a new member of the airs list (note posted
&gt; yet) and I will carry a copy of
&gt; the list with me on the road.
