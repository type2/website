Subject: [T2] Fuel pressure test port

Hey Everyone,
I just thought I'd let you know where you can get your own fuel pressure
test port to add to your bus.  You may be asking, why would I want to
add some non-stock part to my bus?  Because then you don't have shack
and rattle your fuel rail, possibly hurting the fuel injector seals and
fuel hose connections every time you want to check your fuel pressure.

So, if you're still interested, the place to pick one up is off of a
Ford engine at a junkyard.  That's where I got mine, and it was inline
in the fuel line.  It looked like the GMs mounted theirs on their fuel
rails (1 inch pipe) which didn't help much.  You can just slip fuel line
over each end of this one.  Cost me 5 bux and now I can just
quick-connect my fuel pressure gauge without moving fuel lines, fuel
rail, injectors, or worrying that the little screw will leak when I
screw it back in.

Just thought I'd post my findings.. 

later,
MIke

p.s. Steve D., yeah, I could've used a tire schraeder valve, but I'm a
little paranoid that it would leak after a while.  I've had a spraying
fuel hose before.. :)
