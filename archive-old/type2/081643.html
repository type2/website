Subject: Re: [T2] Am i 180 out? (2 Q's)

I will address #2 first:

&gt; QUESTION 2
&gt;
&gt; Also, i figure since i'm running close to stock now, i
&gt; could follow Bentley timing specs - (Table 'i' on page
&gt; 72 of section 5) and set at 10ATDC with vac line on,
&gt; but it sure as hell doesn't like to run there.
&gt; I set it at about 8 ATDC and it still stumbles at take
&gt; off and 'lacks balls' in the high end. The vac is
&gt; working, as i could pull the line while it was running
&gt; with the light on it and watch the mark move -
&gt; although i couldn't tell you how much.
&gt; I don't have the retard side hooked up yet. Is the can
&gt; designed to only work right if it is regulated by the
&gt; presence of manifold vac?  Am i running at full vac
&gt; advance at idle in absence of the retard pressure?

You CANNOT set it at 10 after and expect it to run decently without having
manifold vacuum connected. If you do not have retard connected, set it at 7.5
BEFORE at idle. When you connect retard vacuum, it will go to 10 after. Go to
your 68-79 Bentley, section 5, page 72, Table I, ignition timing.
Model 73/74 dual carb manual trans. It says &quot;10 after TDC Vacuum hoses ON&quot; and
in the next column it says &quot;at 850-950 rpm&quot;
If you pulled the vacuum line from the advance side at idle, AND the timing
moved!!!, you have the wrong hose connected to the advance side. The advance
side gets ported vacuum = NO vacuum at idle, vacuum appears AFTER you open the
throttle.
