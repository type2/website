It is one piece, as you describe.  There should be a plastic strap with 
a snap on it, located on the front passenger door rear pillar, that 
holds the bunched up curtain while driving.  While camping, the rear 
edge of the curtain can be fastened to the screw eye on the tall coat 
closet at the rear of the sliding door.  It is a slight PITA to bunch up 
all that material for driving.  I suppose you could work out some other 
arrangement if you prefer.

&gt; Hi Volks,
&gt;   I'm making new curtains for our 71 westy and am wondering about the 
&gt; one one for the sliding door.  I have the track with the plastic 
&gt; sliders still installed, but need to know about the curtain itself.  
&gt; Is it one piece that gets strapped forward ,next to the sink vent 
&gt; pipe, while driving?  Or is there some other arraignment?
&gt;   Thanks in advance for the help.
