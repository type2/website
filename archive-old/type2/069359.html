Subject: Re: Valve Adjustment and fast idling(Seperate?'s)

        Went to take my bus for a spin on Friday and it was racing.  The idle
was way to fast. I drove it to my parents about 10 miles away without
any problems and borrowed my parents car to get to my second job. 
There I I reviewed both the Bentley and Muir manuals and came to the
conclusion that it had been long overdue for a tune up and this could be
part of my problem.
          1.)  Muir states to rotate the engine 180 degrees and Bentley 90
degrees.  Also Muir states to move clockwise when Bentley say move
Counterclockwise.  Which is correct?
           2.)  Well I preceded to adjust valve 1 and 2, the first at TDC and
the other at 90 degrees counter clockwise.  Skinned the heck out of my
nuckles but definately adjusted to .006.  Did I follow the procedure
correctly.
           3.)  When I got to valve 3 I adjusted the exhaust pretty easily but
had a heck of a time trying to loosen the nut on the intake of 3.  In fact I
stripped it.  I guess I'll have to crack the nut and order a set of new ones
from RMMW's.  
            4.)  Assuming I adjusted 1 and 2 correctly I put a new gasket in
the cover and replaced.  I did not glue the gasket or use grease because
it seemed to fit very well.  Should I go back and change this.

Please respond with recommendations  if I have done this procedure
incorrectly so far.  Kind of funny that the bus acted up on Friday after I
ranted and raved on my love of VW's.  Still love them still, skinned
knuckles and all.  By the way I would like responses on why it is idling
fast.  I know there is an adjustment screw but I won't test that until I do
the valve adjustment and check the timing etc... I hope i don't need a new
air intake sensor, RMMW's has them for around $300.
