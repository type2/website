I got the thermostat  on the 2.0L vanagon intalled and adjusted.  When I got the
motor the wheel was missing to turn the corner, but I got one from my junkyard
motor.  Also got a thermostat but it was bad.  As was the original one on the
motor.   So I got one from Rocky Mountains Motor Works  for twelve bucks or so.
Got it installed and  adjusted for full closure when cold.  Today I took a five
mile drive and checked the flaps.. Hallelujah!! Flaps were fully open.  So now I
heating system is complete at last.The cooling system is still a bit short....
I'm still missing a few rubber seals, which are on order from WCM.  The dipstick
and oil pressure switch rubber boots.  John Jensen in Annapolis
