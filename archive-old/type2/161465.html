  ??

I don't think so, Don,

I've run buses thousands of miles with 72-74 HE's not hooked up at  
either end, and they work fine. They didn't melt or corrode any  
faster than normal.

Happy Trails,

&gt; You'd melt down the HE's. They're designed to have air flowing through
&gt; them whenever the engine's running. The control boxes just control
&gt; where it goes. Either to the cabin or dumped outside.
