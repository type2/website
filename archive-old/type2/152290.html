&gt; &gt;  Can anyone on the list
&gt; &gt; recommend a 1/2 drive breaker bar or slider bar that happily takes
&gt; &gt; 300+ ftlbs of torque.
&gt;
&gt; We went to Autozone and got the big friggin wrench (BFW) made for removing
&gt; tow hitches. Worked beautifully!

for years I have used a 6ft stainless steel hospital orthopedic support
bar for the frames used over beds when one has a broken leg etc.   not
sure where I picked it up but it still looks brand new and I have used it
to break many a bolt (and breaker bar/wrench/socket too)
