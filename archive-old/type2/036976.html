Subject: Rear brakes stuck! How to free?

Hi Volks,

Well, I've gone and done it. I left the lights on in my '78 auto Westfalia
and ran my battery down. Then I left it parked for about 2 weeks in rainy
weather. Then I jumped the battery only to find that my rear brake shoes had
rusted to the drums and they were stuck, but good.  This is bad. I've had 'em
stick before and was always able to free them with a loud POP by putting in
gear and rolling backwards. But now I'm so stuck that reving engine in
forward or reverse has no effect. Bummer! If I had a manual tranny I could
jerk it into gear really abruptly and probably bust 'em loose. But with an
automatic tranny, I can only apply as much torque as the torque converter can
muster. I should have disengaged the emergency brake on day 2. 

I've perused the archives, but find no clear protocols for freeing up 
really stuck brakes shoes. I guess I could try removing the wheels and 
banging the drums off. I don't want to break anything and I'm so 
busy that I don't want to spend a whole lot of time. Just deal with 
it efficiently and decisively. 

Anyone else had to resort to extraordinary measures to free up their bus like
this? What are the risks? What are the tricks? I could try dragging it 
with another vehicle pulling a tow chain. Might I seriously damage my 
brakes by so doing?

Help, VW brothers and sisters!
