Subject: interior measurements
To: type2_at_type2_dot_com

From what year to what year do the westy interiors interchange?  I have lots 
of late model westy interior components but no older for my 65.  I looked 
threw the archives and boards but didn't get the measurements or information 
I was looking for.
Peace Out
