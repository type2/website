Subject: Re: [T2] Just added up the cost of parts that I want/need for 
  my bus

I thought I posted about this... (sorry!)

Smell is gone. After ripping out anything fabric short of the seats
themselves and letting it air out for a coupla months, PLUS scrubbing as
much as possible (and getting rid of the little turds I found all over the
inside.. ewww...) It smells just like a normal used car now.

When I replace all the upholstery and padding, and install new
flooring/carpets it should smell much like a new car. :-D

&gt; Hey, Don, it's about time to get that stink out of the bus, isn't it?
&gt; Have you tracked it down, or is it diffuse and pervasive?
