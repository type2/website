Raoul,
must be nice, my wife is the anti-heater.   you start
out ok, nice and cozy, then she'll tuck the blanket
between her knees and wrap it around her arms....roll
over, and im suddenly without body heat or blanket:)  
meanwhile she is in a perfect cocoon and warm as can
be.   we won't even talk about how she hogs the whole
Z bed either!   but the next morning she flashes that
pretty smile, and we all know how that goes.

&gt; &gt; It's called MYWIFE. If we go camping,
&gt; &gt; and it's at all cold, she's all over me like a
&gt; cheap suit, scavanging
&gt; heat.
&gt; &gt; [Not that I mind, no fool I ]  She has an
&gt; automatic heat sensor, which
&gt; causes
&gt; &gt; her to roll away if it gets too hot, come in
&gt; closer when it gets cold. And
&gt; an
&gt; &gt; air freshener component...what is it about womens
&gt; shampoo??? Drives us
&gt; guys
&gt; &gt; nuts...
