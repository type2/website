It's a lot of fabrication and you might as well start by cutting a hole for
the access hatch a Type 4 engine really needs.

A 73 and 71 bus are so similar especially the campers, you might as well
find a nice 73-79 bus.

A better alternative is to spend the money on the necessary Type 1 engine
upgrades to get the Type 4 power.
