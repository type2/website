Subject: What's this Ink Stamping?

When I was cleaning and stripping my T4 case I noticed this stamping on
the case. Anyone have any idea what it was for? The numbers seem to read
921010. I've not noticed this on cases I've seen from a friends Bus, or
ones in a Junkyard. IF you look in the picture, from the link. It's
right below the Crankcase breather.
 
Hope no one is getting tired of my questions, but I'm learning.
