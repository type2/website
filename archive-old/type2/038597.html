Jack,
I've noticed the same thing with my Kombi, but I've also noticed the 
Kombi has a fair amount of &quot;squat&quot; and is sitting like it has a full load
in the back.  I'm thinking this is my problem, and was wondering if your
Westy was sitting a little low in the rear causing you to lose rearward
vision as well.

Hi All
I need to lower the inside rear view mirror on my 83 Vanagon Westy air
cooled so I see something other than the road 30 feet behind but there
does not seem to be any way to remove it to put in a spacer. HELP! Also
the radio antenna on the left front is loose and I can see no way to
access the nut on the inside to tighten it short of removing the whole
dash! HELP!
Thanks in advance to all knowing listees, Jack
