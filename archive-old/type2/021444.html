RE: Bay area VW bussers - camping.

Y'all are cordially invited for camping &amp; rafting at the MotherLode River Center in September, 5th - 9th.

See a few pics and some links for MotherLode here:

Take the motherlode links. Rafting is available in various flavors, from tame to suicidal...  I've done the chili bar
run a few times.  I'm kind of a wussy...  ;-) This year they have a special on one of the runs for about $40, I think
she told me...  I think camping runs about $12 a night - lunch is available with the rafting but we usually choose to do
our own.

Let's do this!  I'll be coming into camp to decompress from Burning Man, with lots of wild stories, no doubt!

And you bussers coming from Burning Man - this is a nice retreat to compare to harbin or other hot springs - no hot
springs (tho' I bet we can talk our fav guide, Ryan, into puttin' together a couple of river steams for us!), but an
absolutely gorgeous river front campground and sensational staff!  

This place is in my top 3...

Teri
