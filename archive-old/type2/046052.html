Subject: [T2] Drape rails

Help.  I need the Drape rails that go on the sliding door on my 71 Westy.
They were missing when I made the purchase...  If anyone wants to sell me
some or point me in the right direction I would really appreciate it.  

BTW  I have some nice westy style side windows if anyone wants them for $50
