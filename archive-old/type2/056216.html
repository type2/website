Subject: Brake Drum Removal

Hello All

I recently bought a 72 camper.  It had been parked for several years at
least.  However, with a little TLC I got the engine running and with a
lot of elbow grease I  got the bus look'in pretty.

However, several years is much worse on the brakes than the rest of the
bus. I was attempting to inspect the rear brakes and can across a
problem. I can't get the drum off.  The adjusting stars won't budge.
The wheel turns  with difficulty.  Yes, I have removed the  drum nut.

Does anyone have any suggestion on getting the drum off.  I'm itch'in to
drive this guy.

Any help is appreciated.
Brent
