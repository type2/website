&gt; &gt; When this
&gt; &gt; T1 motor is placed where a T4 used to reside
&gt; &gt; there is no rear hanger needed
&gt; &gt; because the tranny is bolted in (not floating
&gt; &gt; like in the 68-71 models) and
&gt; &gt; the torque from the T1 is not enough to destroy
&gt; &gt; the tranny mounts which is
&gt; &gt; the reason the T4 has a rear hanger.

&gt; Do you knowledgeable volks agree or disagree
&gt; with this assertion?
