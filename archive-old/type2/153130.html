Subject: Re: [T2] 70 turn signal switch wanted??

...
&gt;
&gt;211 953 513 J   flashing indicator switch- Self  cancelling
&gt;                           *from 210 2000 001 to 211 2300 000
&gt;                           but this one shows M-code M 24
&gt;                           So this one is 70 and 71 with sealed beam headlamps,
&gt;                           side flashing indicators, and back-up 
&gt;lamps on models
&gt;                           211-268 Export Markets (not for USA or Canada)
&gt;                           *from 212 2000 001
&gt;                           OK, then they used this one on USA from 72.
&gt;
&gt;211 953 513 G  flashing indicator switch- Self  cancelling
&gt;                           *to 219 300 000  with M-code M 524
&gt;                            OK, this would be 68 and 69 except for what M 524
&gt;                            says: Sealed beam headlamps, dual circuit brakes,
&gt;                            back-up lights, and side marker reflectors (LHD).
&gt;                            Sounds like our USA version buses, huh? But it then
&gt;                            says from 219 000 001 without emergency 
&gt;light system
&gt;                            from 210 2000 001 with buzzer for ignition- starter
&gt;                            switch  211-265 models USA and Canada
&gt;                            from 212 2000 001 211-241 models USA, Canada
&gt;
&gt;So, it looks like you want the G switch. But I don't understand the


my chassis number is 220 2049568
   M codes
02 049 568 E
226 133 025 508
41 4 7862 UD 2215 21

i'll look for both J and G switches... but where in the heck is the 
part # on the switch???

i like mike's idea, but swaps are few-between here. i might start by 
resoldering the spare's ground wires on, but my skills at the iron 
ain't too hot.  mike, how did you get apart/reassemble the things? i 
would guess drilling out  the rivets is a start.


oh, one more thing - what size are the screws that hold the t/s 
switch in the housing, and the housing to the column? i se the 
bentley says m5, etc, but what pitch/thread?
