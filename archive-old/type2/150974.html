Subject: reverse don't have to push down...

http://daniel.entityengine_dot_com/images/daniel/VW/BrokenHeart/IMG_0563sm.jpg

Picked up another 71 today, I know have a Westy, this deluxe and a parts 
bus. Plan is for deluxe to be my in town driver and my westy to be in best 
shape for backup and trips.

The new deluxe shifts like hell, you don't have to pop down for reverse and 
thus you have to be really carefully shifting into 2nd to not find reverse 
by accident. I have a rebuilt transmission soon going into my westy, then 
that tranny which pops out of reverse about once a month can go into this 
deluxe, but what causes this? Linkage?

Thanks in advance,
Daniel
