It's not a coincidence that VW changed the belt when they changed the
gearing in the trans for better highway manners (lower RPM at the crank).

The engine slowed down, and they had to speed up the fan.

I laugh when the parts guys have belts that fit ALL upright engines with one
part #. Guys tear their hair out trying to find out why their engine is
overheating.

Going to the alternator belt on BUSSES is a wise move to get rid of the
heat.
