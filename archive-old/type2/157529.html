Subject: Re: [T2] More from Nokian North America

My friendly local Discount Tire quoted me $110 each
for the CQ (studless) 185R14's and I'll be buying 4.
This is just the tire price - another $11 per for
mounting. I will let you all know if this is the
&quot;final&quot; price!

Just a little more info: Both the 185 and the 195 bear
no aspect ratio number - they are 80% aspect ratio -
the &quot;old standard&quot;

On 5.5&quot; rims, the 185's are 25.6&quot; diameter and 7.4&quot;
overall width

On 5.5&quot; rims, the 195's are 26.2&quot; diameter and 7.8&quot;
overall width

The CS (from what I gather) is targeted toward &quot;mild
winter use&quot; and &quot;improved all-season capabilities.&quot;
They are not studded.

The C2 is studded or studable.

The CQ is non - stud targeted for heavy use in snow
and ice.

All three designs bear the Snowflake emblem - Severe
service.

Hope this all helps - and I hope they're as good as
I've been lead to believe! -BaH
