 Hi listees!

The brake servo in my ´71 Kombiwagen has been disconnected for some time
now. The diaphragm seems to have a leak. A friend gave me a servo from his
junked ´76 Doublecab. Will this fit my ´71? Do I have to pull the main
cylinder to get the servos in and out? 
I´d hate to mess with brake bleeding right now, no garage, 10 centimeters
wet snow. No fun spending the day under the bus under theese conditions:-(

Thank you!
Uffe Nyman
