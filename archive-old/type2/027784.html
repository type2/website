Subject: Front Seats for a '76 Bus

I have a '76 Bus with +300K and the original front seats.  Needless to say 
they are in very bad shape (bad enough that my wife refuses to drive 
it)maybe that's good :-).  I would like to get them repaired/replaced.  
Almost all of the bottom springs in the driver's seat are busted up or gone. 
  The melt frame that goes just under the lower upholstery around the front 
edge is broken.  The passenger seat is a bit better but not much.
I looked at Bus Boys who sell a Corbeau Sport Seat but I am leary about it 
being too big, me not being able to fit, or it just looking WRONG (I kinduv 
like the &quot;stock&quot; look).  My local Bow-Wow shop couldn't do any better.
I tried junk yards in the Seattle area but no luck getting anything that is 
any better AND fits (seems the rail system that the driver's seat rides on 
changed sometime between '76 and '78).
So here's the question:  Anyone know if I can have the seats repaired?  OR 
is there an after-market replacement that works, looks decent, and will not 
compromise my headroom (I have about 2&quot; with my seats as they are now)?  Or 
does anyone know of some used one's at a decent price?  The covers don't 
matter, just a goo frame and most of the springs.  I think I can have a 
local shop replace the broken ones.  I just don't want to spend alot of time 
on mine unless it's cheaper than a good used set.
Thanks,
Ted
