Subject: [T2] Back window

I was watching a movie once where these hippy-types were riding in an early
split being chased by a cop, and the one guy was sitting over the engine,
rolled down the back window, and to a shot at him.

The Friday question is, was the roll-down back window an actual option, or
was that just some Movie Magic?  By the way, shooting at cops is dispicable.

Besides letting in noxious exhaust fumes, a roll down window might be a
pretty cool thing.

Anybody?
