the scavengers really had a whack at the shop today, hauled 5 vans, a
pickup and two U-haul trailer loads out, and there is still stuff here,
some REAL difficult to find parts left

.  not one, not 2 but 3 WESTY pop tops with all hardware and canvas(2) s
.  still some blocks
.  still some tranny's (none working but good parts)
.  still some glass and body parts
.  still suspension, drive shafts, torsion bars, lots of misc stuff.
.  lots of little stuff
.  Westy folding seat (NOT Z-bed)
.  some type 3 stuff?

got cleaned out, so there are no more
heads, complete engines, working trannys'


next showing (probably last) is 1:30 PM Sunday, give me a call or e-mail
for directions

Bob
