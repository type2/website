Subject: RE:  cover under 2.0 engine

&gt;hi volks, under the 2.0 engine (76 on) there is the drain plug, 
&gt;strainer cover and some other cover which is about the same 
&gt;size as the strainer cover. what is it? mine seems to be leaking 
&gt;oil, can i take the cover off and put in a new gasket?

That's the sump plate that you see mentioned on the list all the time
(usually in conjunction with the installation of an oil temp sender).
They do seem to be notorious for leaking.  They are sealed to the case
with a large rubber o-ring.  I've found that the most common cause of
leaks on the sump are actually due to leaks at the 2 (10mm?) bolts or
stud/nuts that hold the plate on.  They should each have a copper washer
under them and I've found that some gasket sealer smeared on the threads
of the bolts works wonders.

Oh yeah, BTW, drain your oil before removing that plate!!!!
