Subject: Rear oil seal '81

My signature oil drip seems to now be limited to the center of the carrier
bar. I tried Joel's idea of grease with new valve cover gaskets and that
seemed to do the job on that problem area. I am guessing that this remaining
leak is a product of the rear oil seal. This little spot at the end of any
run is perfectly tolerable but the problem is that at highway speed the
vaporized oil covers the rear of the van just enough to make a wash part of
the driving ritual.

Naturally had I thought about it, I would have changed the seal while I had
the motor out this spring. Now the question is wether or not it is possible
to change the seal without dropping the motor? If it is, I'll just keep
handing the kids the bucket and hose...

Thanks,

Weston
