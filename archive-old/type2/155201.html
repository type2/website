Subject: Looking for an engine- AVP?

Greg,
      Not far from Annapolis in Seabrook... I would talk to Sean at Peek 
Performance, 
                     http://www.peekperformance_dot_com

Sean is active in racing air-cooled VWs, generally a favorable indication of 
tech skills.  His mom is a librarian in Centreville, Md.  He was courteous when 
I needed help with a VW diesel, and others on this list have written favorably 
about Peek.

Glenn
across the Bay from Annapolis in Queenstown, Md.

I'm looking to put either a new or rebuilt engine in my 68' (my  
current engine is fully toast).  Since I don't have many local  
options (Annapolis, MD), I've been looking around for some options.
