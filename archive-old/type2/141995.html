Agreed, Jamie,
                the Horrible Freight tool I was thinking of is practically 
equivalent to the one shown on your link.  They call it a 'large bearing 
separator' whereas the KD folks call it a 'split bearing attachment' in the 
second link you show.  At www.harborfreight_dot_com the part# is 3979-3VGA, list 
price $20; promotional pricing around $10-15 if you find it in a flyer.

I have done what Glenn talked about, but you need some really heavy plate or you
might bend it.. depending on how stuck that bearing is....  A mfg tool is
hardened and can be thinner and stronger....

Here is the tool that you can put behind the gears, and use a threaded puller,,
or put it in a press.

Hope that helps

&gt; Have you looked at the possibility of buying a large gear puller from Horrible
&gt; Freight?  This might work (I just didn't have one at the time); could be an
&gt; easy/cheap choice since they often put them on promotion.  What I am talking
&gt; about looks like a square of steel plate, cut in half, machined in a lathe to
&gt; take out some of the center, and then held together with two bolts.  If you
are
&gt; interested I will find an item# for you.
