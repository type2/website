Dave, I couldnt help noticing that you refer to your Devon as a &quot;Sundowner&quot;
am I right in assuming that this is the style of devon conversion?
Do you or anyone else know how I can go about identifying the what style my
devon is?
(Probably only relevant to the UK listees as I havent seen any mention of
devon conversions other than from them)

TIA
