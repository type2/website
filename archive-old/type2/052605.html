Subject: [T2] Connecting rod bushings

I'm finally beginning to reassemble a 1976 2000cc engine for my 1975
bus. Last night I was going to replace the connecting rod bushings (the
little ends) when I decided to do a little measuring and fitting. I
found that the wrist pins seem like they wont fit into the new bushings?
Do I somehow have the wrong bushings? Do I need to hone the bushing to
allow the wrist pins to fit? Please help. I can't find any reference to
how the wrist pins should fit in the bushings. The old pins had a pretty
free fit in the old bushings. I think if I heat the rod and bushing the
pins may fit but when everything is at the same temp, I don't think the
pins will be able to rotate in the rods at all.

Also, these bushings do not have the 2 little oil holes like the
original ones. Can I get away with drilling them after they are
installed in the rods? Should I leave them as is?

Thanks so much,
Tom

No snow now, but winter is not over yet. Shivvering in the cold,
rebuilding a bus. I think I like it?
