&gt; I'd like to set up a second battery in my bus. Can someone give me info on
&gt; the best way to do this without draining both batteries and ending up
&gt; stranded?

Hi All,

I'm new to the list, am currently plotting the friendly takeover of a '68 Adventurewagen.  I have watched from the side lines for the last couple years as my buddy Chris (EveryBus) has dove head first into the air cooled world.  Now it appears I'm about to follow, I'll know in a couple of days if the deal on the Adventurewagen goes through (if you have an Adventurewagen or any info on them, I'd appreciate you contacting me).

Jen, regarding battery set ups, one excellent source of parts and information is West Marine, online at www.westmarine_dot_com ( or call 1-800-BOATING for a catalog).  The system I imagine you'd want to set up is very similar if not identical to what you'd find in  boats (my other love).  The West Marine catalog has great mini-articles on various topics, including 12 volt electrical system issues.  At a minimum, you'll want a deep cycle marine battery  ( I'm assuming you want to run house systems and not just set up a reserve starting battery) and some type of isolator to
separate the batteries.
