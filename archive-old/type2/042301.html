Subject: 72 engine rebuild advice sought

Hi Volks-

After 3 years of driving my 72 bus with a 77 engine (converted from FI),
I have finally acquired a bone stock 72 engine which I am taking to my
mechanic for rebuilding. I also have a spare 77 engine which I picked up
in my travels.

My mechanic is great.  He does air-cooled VWs only, and I trust him.

I have had a lot of grief messing around with the 77 engine in my bus
currently. I've given up on the &quot;custom&quot; route and I am now a true
believer in bone stock.

I talked to my mechanic about the rebuild, and to my surprise he is
suggesting that the engine be rebuilt from a combination of the two
engines. He claims that I can stick with the 72 crankcase and get extra
power by incorporating the top end of the 77 engine and some of the
internal components of the bottom end (ie, the crankshaft). He also
advises that I put the 77 tranny in to replace my near-dead 72 tranny.
He claims it is geared better for highway driving.

I am hoping to get some opinions on this idea. I'm going to lay out a
lot of bread for this rebuild and I don't want to regret it. Should I
stick to stock or go with my mechanic's advice?
