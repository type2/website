I have a almost new 34 pict 3 FS . i ran it on my very rusty 71 westy for
several months until the motor started acting up from crap in the tank . I
sucked some garbage into the carb . i rebuilt it but i cant get the
accellerator line blown through as the only thing I have is a can of
cleaner. being stuck at a motel i had to buy a new carb so now i have this
one up for sale . . It looks new and still has the box for it.I paid $140
for how bout $50
