Subject: Weird Oil Prob. Please Help...

Thanks for reading.  I feel bad because i always come to the list with
problems and have few answers for other people.  I really appreciate
everyone's help when I get it. My oil prob. is as follows.  I got a
rebuilt engine a short while back and am still in the process of making
the car fully driveable and reliable.  For a while I has the car running
ok with good oil pressure(35-50psi) as according to my vdo guage.  All
of a sudden one day my oil light came on and stayed on, there was no
flickering before.  I checked the oil level and it wasnt full but it was
still well above the low mark.  I did a roadside oil change (partly
because it was a new motor too and frequent oil changes are good) After
I put the new oil in, i tried getting oil pressure with the plugs out
and i couldnt so i had to remove the &quot;in&quot;-(the hose coming from the
pump) oil hose from my external oil filter(my engine is full flowed). I
filled the hose with oil and even cleaned the nipple and blew air into
the hose and refilled it with oil several times to make sure the gears
on the pump were covered in oil.  After that i got oil pressure and was
on my way.  On the very short ride home the light didnt flicker or come
on.  I took the car out the next day and the same thing happened.  I
made sure to add enough oil so that it was more than full when I changed
it.  I had to reprime the pump to get oil pressure again and on the
short ride home the oil pressure was at 20psi and then the light came on
as i was pulling in my driveway.  Now i tried to reprime the pump again
while it is in my driveway and i cant get it to pump. I even added an
extra quart because of the external loop. Another thing i did was i
bought a tee fitting so that i could use my vdo guage and my stock oil
press. switch because i thought the sender might be at fault but the
stock switch confirms no oil press.  While i was installing the tee
fitting i had to hold my finger over the hole in the case to prevent oil
from slowly leaking out.  After i tried turning the engine over a few
times i removed the sender to see how much oil would come out and alot
more did.  that is where i left it.  Mind you i didnt find any oil leaks
in the whole oil loop or anywhere. I am really at a loss as to what to
do, I am only a teenager and have limited resources.  Everything was
going pretty well with the whole engine installation up until now. 
Sorry about the long post and any help will be very much appreciated.
thanks
