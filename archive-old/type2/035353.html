Subject: Anyone have exp. shipping buses?

Folks,

In my quest for a new (to me) bus, I'm search is going pretty far
afield--anywhere in North America, in fact.  Anyone used a
trucking/rail/whatever company to transport a bus long distances?
Suggested firms?  Costs?  Pointers?  Warnings?  Any info would be helpful
at this point.

I'd likely be shipping from either the SW or NE to the Vancouver BC /
Seattle area.

I've tried Autolog so far, and they won't ship a Westfalia.

T.
