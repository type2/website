Subject: Re: [T2] charcoal cannister

Hey list,

is this charcoal canister mounted above the inside of the decklid with two
big clear tubes from the case to canister &amp; from canister to air cleaner
with two smaller tubes heading up to the air scoops?

if yes, what years was this stock for? please consider I am in California
also with abundant smog and smog laws.

thanks, Billy.

P.s. Another non-waving bus driver passed me today. For shame.

&gt; I read a message on here the other day about the
&gt; charcoal filter in a '71 bus, and the part no. was
&gt; listed as 175 201 801a, and that VWoA had them for
&gt; $61.00.  I called my local VWoA, they told me $74, I'm
&gt; wondering if there is another source, perhaps
&gt; cheaper???
