Subject: Re: [T2] was HP/ Larger engines in Aircooled

Such a plain nose... 

It shows a pet peeve of mine too - lots of time detailing and modifying the exterior, but the engine area looks like it belongs under a dumptruck. An afternoon of cleaning, squirt of paint, and an occasional re-cleaning. Mine has $15 of paint in the engine area, no polished anything or chrome anything. Just basic. But clean.

Sort of like a new red paint job with dirty blue door doorjambs. 

Would I go 173mph in a bus? Heck no! Been up to 123 mph in a Rabbit 'vert many times in Italy, had my Kawasaki Concours up to 137 mph once after a close encounter with a red Camaro (he wanted to race but was VERY reckless. If I didn't want to race, he'd just run me off them road!). I'm older now and get my kicks at 45 mph... 

My bus has involuntarily changed lanes on a windy day at 65 mph. Wonder what it would be like at 173 mph? Change highways? &lt;grin!&gt;
