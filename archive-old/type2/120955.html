Subject: Re: [T2] Bad hydraulic lifters (rant)

Back around 100,000 mi  when I was still using a mechanic, I complained
about cold engine noise and he replaced just the lifters (probably were
OK, I didn't know about bleeding down lifterts then).  Those lifters are
still in use on the original cam at 245,000 mi!

 Practically speaking if you have a bad lifter and you want to replace
it rather than split the case, how much is engine life reduced? Doesn't
anyone know? &gt; Put another way, after you break in a cam what happens to
it that makes putting in new lifters later a problem?
