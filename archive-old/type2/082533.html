Subject: Re: [T2] Speaking of basic items...  Electronic vernier caliper

&gt; One &quot;mystery feature&quot; is that it includes what is
&gt; called an &quot;SPC port&quot;
&gt; which looks a lot like a USB port.  Has anyone got
&gt; any idea what this is?
&gt; 
My best guess is that this is a port for transferring
data (measurements) to a computer via manufacturer
supplied software and cable for 'Statistical Process
Control&quot; or &quot;SPC&quot;. SPC is a method of monitoring a
process during its operation in order to control the
quality of the products while they are being produced.
Pretty nifty but of little use outside a manufacturing
environment that requires process control.
