Hi Volks,

Chris wrote to the List:

&gt; &gt; Type IV -- Variant

&gt; Perhaps &quot;variant&quot; has a
&gt; generic translation from German that goes some like &quot;little station 
&gt; wagon&quot;

Good guess, but wrong.  &quot;Variant&quot; is the term Volkswagen used 
and still is using for all their station wagons: Type 3, Type 4, 
Passat (Dasher/Quantum), Golf, and Polo.  It is not a German 
word, though some VW afficionados use it as a generic term for
all makes' station wagons instead of the proper German word 
&quot;Kombi&quot;, short for &quot;Kombinationswagen&quot;, &quot;combination vehicle&quot;, 
thus named for its being a passenger car and a (sort of a) 
transporter combined.  Ah, confusion... :-)

To complete the list:

Type 1 - Bug, Super Beetle, Convertible, Karmann Ghia, Thing etc.
Type 2 - Bus, Transporter, Camper; subdivided into:
    T1 - Splitty (50-67)
    T2 - Bay (68-79)
    T3 - Vanagon (80-92)
    T4 - Eurovan (front engined, 90-today)
Type 3 - VW 1500/1600 Notch, Fastback aka TL, Squareback aka Variant
Type 4 - VW 411/412 2dr/4dr Fastback, 2dr Squareback aka Variant

Car - Engine relation:

Type 1 - Type 1 engine
Type 2 - following engine types:
     Type 1 engine -71
     Type 4 engine 72-83(?)
     watercooled gas boxers and diesel in-lines later on in the T3
     watercooled in-lines and VRs in the T4
Type 3 - modified Type 1 aka Type 3 engine
Type 4 - Type 4 engine

Non-US delivery, German production Type 2 annotations:
Type 1 engine was available in the T2 72-79 too, a modified Type 1 
engine was available in the T3 80-82, and a Type 4 engine was
optionally available for all this time.
The watercooled boxer is a heavily modified Type 1 engine too, some
say.  It does sport a vague resemblance optically.  I have never
seen it out of the car though.

This refers to German production only.  Abroad production of Mexico,
Brazil, and South Africa differs substantially.

Airhowlingly yours,
    Erik.
