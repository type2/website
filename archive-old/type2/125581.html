Subject: Re: [T2] thoughts on converting FI to carb

Wrong ... The driving factor were North American emission requirements. In
other markets (including Germany) air cooled buses and vanagons never
received FI. Dual carbs until 1982. I am not sure about the water-leakers
though.

Made things a lot simpler - there is only one 72-83 muffler and only two
different heater boxes: square port or oval port for the rest of the world.
That is for the type 4 engine; 1600 engines with single carbs were available
through 82 as well.

Still, I agree: keep FI. I have messed with both and based on my experince
go with a 79 FI system, get a Vanagon electronic ignition (if you do not
have the CA setup, a water-leaker ignition will work fine), and install a
72-74 exhaust system.

FI is superior, thats why the VW engineers went that way, and NEVER looked
back......
