Subject: Looking for parts and info

Hello fellow Volksters,

    Yes I'm back from my cross country trip....35 days and 8,850 miles.
This with few mechanical problems thanks in part to the excellant advise
I got from this list. I will write more on my trip later this week.

   What I would like to locate today is parts for a friend. She owns a
1980 VW Camper...type II with FI 2000. What she is looking for is a
rebuilt engine or advise on to rebuild existing one (still runs) or get
another. Also the tranny (manual) needs a rebuild as well. Where would
be the best place to purchase either of the above?
   Also she is looking for the outside tent that attaches to the side
door. She has only been able to find this from a company in Germany. The
shipping makes this to expensive.

Thanks for any help,

Pete

1975 VW 9 Pass. Bus (still under 30,000 orgin. miles)
1971 VW Bug
