Subject: flywheel seal leak + engine pull advice

hello all; 

I have a constant and annoying oil leak on my '71 bus which I have been
told is a flywheel seal leak...oil runs down the front of the engine and
drips onto the ground right off the front bottom of the case, ahead of the
drain plate. Oil is likely slinging around in the bell housing, as oil is
also soaking the starter and running down the starter mounting points. I
am also hoping this oil leak is (partly) the source of the fumes in my
heater...and my clutch chattering...

anyhow...two questions. 

1. Is this likely the flywheel seal leak? Any other seals that it might
be? 

2. I need to pull the engine to get at it...it's a '71 1600 dp, which
supposedly is easy to remove. I've never done an engine pull before, on
any kind of vehicle, and if anyone can point me to some good hints/tips (I
have Bentley/Muir), that would be peachy. 

Assuming I can get the engine out, should I replace any other seals
besides the flywheel seal while I'm at it? I figured the clutch plate may
be shot after being coated in oil for a few thousand miles, so I ordered
another one...I'll put that in...

I also don't have any jacks/stands...suggestions for what to buy + weight
ratings? 

Thanks again, 
this one's intimidating me a bit...! 

cheers
dc
