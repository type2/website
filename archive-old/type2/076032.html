Subject: Breaking in an engine 


I checked out the Norton Owners site.  

http://pistol1.home.mindspring_dot_com/enginebreakin.htm


Quite a lot of useful stuff there. For those with rusty fuel tanks there
is an excellent step-by-step on using sloshing sealer.  The running in
instructions are similar to Carroll Smith's views.  I recommend his books
highly. Engineer/Tune/Prepare to Win etc.  He covers the whys in fine
detail as well as the hows, and backed it up with superior results.
