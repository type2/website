Yes, so what is the problem? I have learned that anxiety-provoking
acceleration (or lack thereof) is one of the *charms* of the VW bus. Before
getting a bus, I thought my old Tercel was slow. What's the big hurry?
Perhaps you need more of a head start when you hit the freeway ramps ;-). I
think the &quot;Don't worry, be happy&quot; philosophy is a LOT cheaper, too. Now for
some _constructive_ advice: Maybe all it needs is a tuneup. Bad timing,
etc. has a BIG effect on engine performance. I'd try that before investing
3K in a new engine. Good luck,
