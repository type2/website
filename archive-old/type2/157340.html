Subject: Re: [T2] hYDRAULIC LIFTERS ON SOLID LIFETR CAM, LOBE PROFILES

That could be true, but since you would have to split
the case to do the cam anyway, I would probably just
use the installed cam and see what happens.  If it
wears out later, well split the case when the time
comes.  If it doesn't wear out, great, you saved a
teardown.

Yikes. From what i've been told by various engine
builders (i too asked this a while back) &amp; it is
mentioned in the book &quot;building aircooled vw engines&quot;
(the redish/pink one), you can not put solid lifters
on a hydraulic cam. It wasn't the lobe profile, but
the hardness of the lobes. Apparently, the solid
lifters are harder metal than the hydraulic lobes,
causing premature cam death!
