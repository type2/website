&gt; Yes, but it has to be an exact color. I'll essentially be painting the

&gt; slightly different from the first two &quot;coats,&quot; but they have to match.
&gt; I'll probably buy all of that all at once, blend it, and re-can half.
&gt; (Since I have everything I need to paint with a good paint gun, I
&gt; probably won't rattle-can it.)

pretty much the same way I did it, I have a good paint gun and compressor
but like you I couldn't take it off the road for more than a day so I
found the convienence of doing a small section at a time, and then zap it
out of the can, good quality rattle can, not the cheap stuff.
