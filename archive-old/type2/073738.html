Lurker with a thought...

Every fall I undercoat problem areas of both my bus and bug with a =
mixture of kerosene and motor oil.  Its messy, it reeks, but it has kept =
the rust at bay (no pun...).  Living here in the rust belt (NJ) and =
using the bus as a daily driver during the winter is a test of will that =
I am slowly losing.

Anyone know of a reasonable and knowledgeable body shop in NJ who could =
cut out some rot and do some welding?
