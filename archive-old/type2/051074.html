Subject: [T2] A CV Question, if you please..

Hi all:

As I recall, at some point VW began recommending that the wavy spring
washer that comes with CV joints *not* be installed.  Anybody know
why?

The reason I ask is that I removed my old transmission today and both
CV joints had transmission oil in them; one had *lots* of oil, the
other just a little.  When I installed the trans a few years ago (a
used one from a junkyard) I installed new oil seals at the drive
flanges and installed new CV joints.  I had the CV joints pressed on
by a shop (they actually sent it out to someone else to have it done)
and when I picked then up the spring washers were installed!  I
objected, but the guy who owns the shop called the machinist who
installed them and he assured me that they would be just fine.  I
wasn't really in a position to argue about it one way or the other, so
I just took the axle shafts and installed them.

Anyway, I was wondering if the inclusion of the spring washers in any
way contributed to the &quot;oil in the CV joints&quot; problem.  So, why did VW
make the change with regard to these things?

TIA.
