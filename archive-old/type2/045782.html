&gt; &gt; there are a zillion different 2-conductor plug and socket combinations,
&gt; &gt; but the neatest and cheapest I've found is a 2-pin Molex plug available at
&gt; &gt; Radio Shack.  Their catalog number for this part ends in 222, but I can't
&gt; &gt; remember the rest.

&gt; I have to disagree with the Molex thing. They are a pretty poor connector
&gt; and I dont think they are rated for many connection cycles. Myself, Id use
&gt; the lighter socket before molex but you are right that there a lot of
&gt; choices and many of them would be a lot better than either of these.

Well, this is a standard connector used by hams all over the US to power
their mobile radios.  It probably isn't the most rugged connector, but
I've never had one fail except through abuse (like tugging the wire at an
angle)
