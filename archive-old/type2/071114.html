      Continued working this evening getting the Westy ready for paint. Since 
the repaint done on it ? years ago is crap, I decided to strip it off, my 
goal to down to the original finish. Well...what I am getting under the white 
paint is some kind of black primer/sealer. If I reapply the stripper to that 
it goes down to bare metal. In some places it has gone down just to the 
original paint. It is interesting to note that I found (so far, 5) some spots 
of rust that had been sanded down (after the white repaint, because the black 
stuff has been sanded away around each spot) and painted over. These appeared 
as black spots when the paint was stripped off, but turned orange (rust) when 
I hit them with the grinder. I took each one down to shiny clean metal, then 
filled the gouge marks with a thin skim of Metal-2-Metal filler. This shows 
me that the effort to strip the old finish is worth it, because sometime down 
the road these spots would have rusted through the new paint. This is not fun 
work, but hopefully it will be worth it in the long term.       Jeff S.
