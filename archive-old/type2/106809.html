Subject: Re: [T2] Sway bars

&gt;My question is can you upgrade to the rear 7/8&quot; bar only and use it with the
&gt;stock front 11/16&quot; bar or will this upset the handling? Right now the front
&gt;seems fine, but it's the rear that's flopping the bus over on turns.

Front only or front and rear, never rear only (or bigger rear bar) b/c a 
stiffer rear end leads to oversteer. Fun on the track but heart stopping on 
a wet mountain road I'd bet.

This info is based on an old suspension book I have.
