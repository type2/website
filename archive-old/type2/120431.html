&gt; German automotive in Fletcher, NC sells these by the bag of 100.  Great

New screws are good.  Green loctite isn't.  I want those screws to come
out next time I need them to, and I don't have any loosening problems with
anti-sieze.  You don't want to have to apply big torque to those attached
nuts!  Break one loose and you have to mangle the tin to get it apart.
