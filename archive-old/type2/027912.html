&gt;&gt;We then pulled a plug out and cranked on the ignition in which case I 
&gt;&gt;should see the spark jump between the gap in the plug....correct?  There 
&gt;&gt;wasn't a spark there.  &lt;&lt;

I believe that in order to get spark across the gap, the body (the threaded 
part) of the plug must be grounded, so this test didn't really tell you you 
have no spark at the plugs.
