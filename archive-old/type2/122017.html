&gt; ok i am confused. i push start my 78 fi bus all the time. (not so much

&gt; backward. fairly easily in fact.  is that a problem. is something 
&gt; being hurt???

That's surprising.  I don't think you're hurting anything.  I just 
think it'd be  very difficult, at least, to push start an FI engine :-)

On an FI engine, the fuel pump has to be running in order to supply 
fuel pressure for the injectors.  But if you're push-starting, the key 
is not in the &quot;start&quot; position and so the fuel pump relay isn't going 
to be closed (plus your battery is dead anyway), so the pump isn't 
going to be running.  Also, the ECU isn't going to have juice of your 
battery is dead.

Carbureted engines don't have this problem, since there's usually fuel 
sitting in the bowl, and that is enough to get them running.  They 
don't need the ECU to be powered up, either :-)

Now, maybe if your battery is not totally flat, there's enough juice to 
power up the ECU... and maybe also enough to run the pump once the 
engine starts sucking air (which will open up the AFM and cause the 
pump to start running).
