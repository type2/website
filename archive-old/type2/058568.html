Hello,
I have a '72 bus with 1700 pankcake engine, and dual webber carbs with no
auto-choke on them.  Is there a way of getting a choke for them so I can start
it in the winter?  Also, do you know of anywhere or anyone that has a
replacement body-panel for beneath the windshield, or a suggestion on how to
patch it up before my windshield falls out!
Thank you for your time,
Shawn Smithson
