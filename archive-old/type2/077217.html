Subject: Transformation: Manual transmission in automatic volks

Hi to every body on this mailing list. I'm new on this mailing list and I
need help from the Type II world for this little project.

Basicly I would like to convert my actual 1979 automatic bus to manual. I
found most of the part including: decel valve, shifter assembly, clutch
pedal, selector shaft, transmission itself and  drive shaft. They are from a
manual bus 1977. I plan to install all those parts on my bus.

I read a lot and find what could be the major problem with this project.
First the installation itself; drillng, sizing... Second I have to change
the drive shaft cause they are not the same lenght. But there's still a big
problem: my electronic control unit. I'm not sure if I can keep my ECU from
my automatic bus to run a manual tranny.

I double check in the archive to find the answer but I don't really find the
exact one. Probably you discussed the subject before. Sorry for that.

The big question is : Could I use my ECU from my automatic bus to run a
manual transmission?

Thank for your help. I really appreciate.
