&gt;CIP1_dot_com has just announced that Bosch-USA will no longer produce the 
&gt;(in)famous 009 for our air-cooled wonderments.  Cheer or cry.  If you want 
&gt;one, now is the time to buy.  If you really don't care, then I guess you're 
&gt;in the same boat as I am.  :^D

Ron, what else? I hear the blue coil is being discontinued as well.
