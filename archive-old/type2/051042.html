&gt; If the heat exchangers only get so hot then how does running more

Derek-

My guess would be that the air entering the cabin would be cooler, but there
is more of it and that adds more total heat to the cab.

The way I got my head around this conundrum was to think of it this way.  As
you blow air over the heat exchangers faster, you're right - they should get
cooler.  But for this to happen, more heat must be leaving the exchangers
and entering the air.  So the total heat collected by the air is greater
than before the booster fan, even if each cc of air is cooler.  Total heat
delivery = air temperature x air volume.

Cheers,
