Subject: Brake diagnostic

Bussers,

Before messing with anything that is not related, I would appreciate your 
diagnostic :

Brakes are discs in the front, drums in the back. It seems that PO changed 
front pads, rear cylinders and shoes about 2 years ago. It seems that the 
brake lines are original andthe brake fluid level is the same as when I 
bought the bus (a month ago).

When the brakes have not been used in the last 10 seconds, pedal goes to 
about 1/2 and then bus brakes OK but steers to the left.

When the brakes have been used in the last 10 seconds, pedal goes only to 
about 1/3, feels fantastically solid and bus stops really fast and remains 
straignt.

I am getting used to do a quick &quot;pressure up the brakes&quot; when I feel I'll 
need the fantastic stopping power. It would be even better to have the 
fantastic stopping power always ready to serve.

My preferred explanations (by order of preference)

1) Collapsed brake lines - replace
2) Air somewhere - bleed
3) Faulty master cylinder (that valve that is supposed to keep pressure up 
in the system, however it does not explain the left steering)- replace

Thanks in advance

- Arnaud
