Well the Torque Master thing I will not get in to : P As far as gaskets go,
you should go with the stock metal ones instead of fabricating some that
will probably fail sooner than later.  To buy the metal ones will only set
you back a couple bucks and you wont have to do this again for a while.
Just my $.02

Bob:

Your theory of a vacuum leak is interesting.  Here's some more background:

When I installed the new carb, I only had to disconnect one intake manifold,
and I chose the right-side manifold because I had the generator off to
change the oil pump.  The manifold did NOT have a gasket, so I made one out
of some gasket material I had in the garage.  It didn't occur to me that I
should check the left-side manifold to see if there was a gasket or not.
Funny that this is the side of the engine that's not working.  

I will try your suggestion of spraying WD-40 around the base of the
left-side manifold when I get home tonight.

Otherwise, I changed the distributor, spark plug wires (twice), and spark
plugs (I used Torque Master, the best spark plug on the planet, no
question), checked valve clearance, made sure a spark was jumping from the
distributor to all the spark plug wires, made sure the spark plug wires were
all connected OK, ETC...ETC.

I'll let you know what happens tomorrow.

Thanks,

Jim

after you remove the valve cover and check to make sure that your valves are
adjusted correctly to .006,  and the valves on that side are not all
completely closed.  Check the intake manifold where it connects to the head
on the left side.  Sounds like you have a vacuum leak.

to verify it's leaking*sucking air* -- with the engine at idle spray some
WD-40 around the manifold &amp; carburetor connections, on each connection one
at a time.  If the engine changes speeds or speeds up at a particular
connection, you found your problem......
