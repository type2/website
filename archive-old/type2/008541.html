Subject: MSHP broken exhaust guide boss
Cc: type2_at_type2_dot_com

Hi David,

As for the broken exhaust guide boss, I ran one in the same condition (as
much boss broken off and exhaust guide exposed) for 50k miles on a type I
single port head in my '71 Westy with no *noticeable* problems.  In the
worse case scenario, assuming the guide didn't drop altogether, I figured
I'd notice either low compression from overheating or a tight valve during
adjustments, but neither occured.  Finer details such as a performance
difference were unnoticeable to my untrained senses.   The head was rebuilt
by a friend (he had his own shop, raced oval track, and had worked on VWs
since the early '70s FWIW).  He pointed out the broken boss and said he'd
rebuild another core if I wanted, but assured me the guide wouldn't move.  I
was primarily concerned with the guide dropping and as you are, secondarily
concerned with exhaust gas flow and heat dissipation.  He felt my secondary
concerns were negligible for a road car.  I trusted him (I also knew where
he lived) and lived happily ever after :).

No hard data here I'm afraid, just one guy's experience or maybe good luck.
The engine I ran that head on was not volumetrically balanced, dynamically
balanced, or any other good thing (and it didn't sound as smooth as my
current balanced engine's bottom end that I hope will last longer than my
previous engine).  I hate to come out publicly on the seemingly half-ass
side of engine work, but it's probably more important to register my data
point for everyone's information.  So everyone get a hammer and break your
guide bosses--&quot;it works for me&quot; (hmmm, maybe I've gone too far... ;)

Good luck,

Ron
