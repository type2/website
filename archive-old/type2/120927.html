Subject: Changing transmission oil.

Hi All:

My last question regarding the damm transmission (had a frustrating
evening getting selector shaft out). Anyone know of a good
article/procedure on changing the transmission oil while the
transmission is still in the van? It would seem that I need some type of
pump to fill the transmission up. What does the community use? And what
type of seal is on the drain/fill plugs? Nothing is listed on my ETKA.


TIA
Regards,
