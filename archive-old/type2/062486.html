Hi Bob

How about driving/walking the soaking carb to your local gas
station and using their air hose?

&gt; 'Lo all:
&gt; I'm in a quandry about rebuilding my carb. It's not the building that 
&gt; troubles me, it's he cleaning. After you soak the carb, you're supposed to 
&gt; blow out all the passages with compressed air. Problem is, you guessed it, I 
&gt; have no air compressor. And I don't think it would be fiscally advisable to 
&gt; buy one to rebuild my carb. Any thoughts? Does anyone sell cans of 
&gt; compressed air?
