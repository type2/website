Subject: Re: [T2] Flooded engine. Really.

Since having to replace both rear corners and having
to replace the battery trey and half of the trey on
the opposite side, I have given this topic much
thought. I have throughly sealed the inside of my
engine compartment and painted it with POR 15. I then
gave it 3 coats of Por15 Whitecote There is no place
for the water to slowly drip so I have decided to pour
some water in each trey to see where the water
collects. I will then drill a hole in the middle of
the low spot. My plan is to attach a 5&quot; piece of
vacuum line underneath the hole with a metal clip and
seal around this connection with seam sealer. This
way, water will be allowed to drain from the tray but
road water will not be able to travel back up the
tube. Using the vacuum tube will also bring the water
away from the vehicle. I will probably use a verry
narrow guage of vacuum line so as little hot air as
possible gets pulled into the engine compartment.

&gt; &gt; The list concensus when the topic came up

&gt; &gt;
&gt; Let me state an opposing viewpoint...
&gt; 
&gt; The plugs are there for a reason, too!  Those pans
&gt; are located right
&gt; behind the rear wheels.  When water comes in thru
&gt; the top (unless you are
&gt; next to a semi), it's rain water and benign.  As
&gt; long as it goes away in a
&gt; day or two, all is well.  The water that the rear
&gt; tires is kicking up is a
&gt; different kettle of salt cod! It is contaminated
&gt; with dirt, rocks, salt,
&gt; and other unmentionable substances.
