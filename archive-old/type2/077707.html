&gt;Chris and everybody...
&gt;    If you have a custom cabinet shop nearby, ask if they use imported birch
&gt;plywood. A local shop here does and they order the stuff by the truckload. The
&gt;Euro-spec plywood (roughly 5'x5') comes in bundles. The plywood itself is 
&gt;close
&gt;to US spec stuff, but does require slightly different tooling for dados 
&gt;and such.
&gt;
&gt;    Anyhow, getting to the point, these bundles have a sacrificial cover 
&gt; sheet (2
&gt;per bundle) of 1/8&quot; (not actually, but darn close) birch plywood. It is 
&gt;usually
&gt;tossed in the dumpster. One side of the plywood is usually munged up with
&gt;forklift scars and/or bootprints, but the side that was facing the inside 
&gt;of the
&gt;bundle is usually clean.
&gt;
&gt;    I've stashed away a couple sheets for when I get around to the 
&gt; interior of my
&gt;project bus. Check your local shops and you might get lucky.

&gt; &gt; &gt;The issue regarding available plywood material sizes has been with us 
&gt; for a
&gt; &gt; &gt;while, but it's good to know there is a source for oversized 
&gt; sheets.  Anyone
&gt; &gt; &gt;have contact info on Harbor Sales?
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; They have it:  http://www.aircraftspruce_dot_com/main.html
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; And a great free catalog. (They'll make their money off of me when i buy
&gt; &gt; another set of engine instruments).
