Subject: Re: [T2] Travel to Denver: High road or low road?

I agree with Anton on this. There is still a long climb from Kingman to 
Flagstaff, Arizona (7,000 feet gain in elevation).

One thing about doing the 15/70 is that there's a stretch of more than 
100 miles in Utah with &quot;no services.&quot; Not even on and off ramps, except 
for a private ranch somewhere along there. In practical terms, I don't 
know how much difference this makes. But psychologically, in a bus, 
it'll keep your knuckles white.
