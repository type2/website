Subject: Re: [T2] AIRS UPDATES: An new idea

Hey Josh,

Yep, that's exactly what I was planning on. I'm already working on the 
database.

And yeah, I'll do away with the frames. I certainly wont turn down any 
help  :-) 

The user table currently contains a
uid (unique), givenname, surname, password, createddate, lastmodified

The preferences table will cover most of the other stuff on the webpage
beer preference, engine types, etc.

Cheers,
Harry

&gt;&gt;Please, PLEASE, no more frames.  And no crazy backgrounds.  Lets make
&gt;&gt;it clean and simple.

&gt;&gt;Are we thinking PHP with a MySQL backend?  I would be happy to pitch
&gt;&gt;in if you need it - I do a lot of PHP and MySQL work.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Are we thinking about a user system - let folks register, give them a
&gt;&gt;password, etc.  so they can come back in and update their record?
