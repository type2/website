Subject: Need Bus Examined in Asheville NC

My friend Mark Carrig has been wanting a Vanagon Westy for a long time, he
has some money set aside, he's patiently staking out Everett's site, biding
his time. Now he's ready to pounce if we can just get somebody to give this
remote bus a once-over.

It's a waterboxer but please don't let that stop you; Mark really needs
somebody to drive it, look for rust, have a look at the suspension, etc. If
you feel like doing a compression test that would be cool but if not, that's
cool too.

I understand the bus is located somewhere near the university there in
Asheville. Any help appreciated. If you say the bus us a go then Mark is
going to send the dude the money.

Thx,

--Hoop
