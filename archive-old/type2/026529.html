Subject: RE:  Heater-box flaps from fan housing

&gt;I noticed the two metal flaps that go between the vents at the 
&gt;bottom of the fan housing to openings in  the heater-box assembly. 
&gt;No matter which way I tried to fit them, they didn't seem to want 
&gt;to be there. Yet I remember them somehow fitting when I took off
&gt;the exhaust. So I ended up just leaving them off. Is this a very bad
&gt;thing? Does anyone know how they are supposed to work and fit?

Those innocuous looking little pieces of tin are important.  I don't think
you'll melt down your engine without them (at least not immediately), but
it's worth the time and effort to put them back on.  What they do is close
off the air flow from the heat exchangers BACK into the fan housing when the
motor shut off.  That prevents all that hot air from rising back up into the
engine compartment.

If you're having trouble getting them back on, maybe you've swapped them?
There is a right and a left (different sizes/shapes to match the fan
housing).  If they don't quite close all the way when they're haning
straight down, gently bend them to fit.
