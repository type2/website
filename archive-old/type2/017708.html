&gt; Well since it's Friday and I'm not on the road to NC I just want to say
&gt; that I think Todd Hill is a real class act!
&gt;
&gt; Most suppliers are in the mind set of send me your money and good luck
&gt; getting your parts or any help afterwards. Not only did Todd recognize that
&gt; Scott is a customer he offers help inthe form of a letter and possible
&gt; quick delivery of the parts.(transaxel?)
&gt;
&gt; It is fantastic to see suppliers who take an active part in the List and
&gt; offer help when possible. Hooray to you Todd. Also, kudos go to Ron Salmon
&gt; who is on the list and a helpful contributor.
&gt;

I have to second, third and fourth all of that.  Todd not only replied with
help, but almost moments after I posted my note.    I have already lined up
alternates if my primary plan falls through tommorow.  My mechanic said I was
free to keep both of them over in his yard until I get things straightened out

Also, Ron Salmon &amp; Bus Depot are doing their part to getting this truck back on
the road.  I'm currently surrounded (literally) by brake parts recently
received from them and their quick service.

Thanks Todd &amp; Ron!
