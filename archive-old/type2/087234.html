Subject: Re: [T2] Help with adjusting valves....

Troy,

Full contact on the nut...not partially on it...or a very long
extension on your ratchet, just to get it loose.

Worst case...take the whole rocker arm off and get it on a bench.

Cheers, dave

&gt; Ok, racket coming from under left valve cover.  Took them off the adjust
&gt; valves.  I am at tdc for #1.  Now, I can not get the locknut loose in
&gt; order to adjust the screw.  I have tried almost everything and said
&gt; every word in the process.  As well as busted two knuckles.  (Ouch!!)
&gt; Are they just really really tight or am I doing something wrong?  Thanks
&gt; for the help.  I'll be in IRC too.
