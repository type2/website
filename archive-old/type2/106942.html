Subject: 72-79 Pickups' rarity

John,

from the type2 archives:

Comercial vehicles were not imported into the US after 1971 (as a result of the &quot;chicken war- tarrif wars&quot;) and that included single cabs (261),
double cabs (265), panels (211) or ambulances (274). Any such vehicles in the US later than 71's were probably grey-market cars. I'm guessing you're in the US, but I may be wrong! Such a vehicle would not be all that uncommon in the UK or European continent.
Al Brase
69 double cab

END

Apparently, the US put a huge import duty on german trucks in 1971 as a result of high german import duties on US chickens!

Lame,

Billy

&gt;Hi,
&gt;How come 72-79 pickups are so rare in the United &gt;States--or is it just me? I'd love to find a &gt;doublecab especially, but this seems impossible. I'd &gt;just like to know why these are so hard to find.
