Jason,

1) The tube from the crankcase breather{which is: the black plastic elbow
(with the large circle on the top) at the top rear of the engine}runs to the
corrugated looking black rubber air intake hose (that itself runs form the
air cleaner to the throttle body). There are two similar hoses at the same
location on the air intake hose, the other one is for the Auxiliary Air
Valve.

2) The cable runs down thought he cooling tin to the lower passenger side of
the block around a pulley, where there is then a funny looking thermostat
(pull off the piece of cooling tin on the bottom of the passenger side of
the engine between the block and the heater box to see it). If the flaps
still have the return spring functioning you are sort of OK in this regard.
Push on the lever and if it springs back closed you are in business. The
thermostats are cheap and easy to install though.

There are a lot of different factors to setting the Idle. The advance, the
two air bypass screws, a properly functioning air bypass valve, etc. You
really need a Bentley Manual and some time and thought to do it right. You
will burn up your engine at 20 BTDC. My distributor shaft is not aligned
correctly either, but it does not necessarily matter.

Good Luck,
