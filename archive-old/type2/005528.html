&gt;It must be a 914 motor.
&gt;Does anyone know the compression ration of this motor?
&gt;&gt; what is the engine code????
&gt;Where do i find it, I looked at every exposed piece of engine i can find
&gt;and can't seem to find it, (it mite be under some grease). I looked in my
&gt;Bentley manual and i can't find where its at in there either.

1.7 , 1.8 engine code is located adjacent to the case seam at the front.
2.0 engine code is located adjacent to the case seam at the rear between the blower
and the oil breather/ filler area.
CR varies with engine , ranges 7.3 to 8.6 stock.
Dave
