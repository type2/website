Subject: Re: [T2] Question about normal running oil temperature

&gt; Alter looking in several manuals, and so searched in a couple of mails in the
&gt; archives, can anyone tell me which is the normal  running oil temperature for
&gt; a type4 1.7lt engine ??.


pedro
you asked a mouthful there. so much depends on the environment and the
condition of your engine including tin and tuning.
but i think concensus will agree that

up to 220 is very cool
220-235  groovy
235-245 warmish
245-255 a little hot
255+ probably getting too hot

there is no absolute here. gauges can have large errors. some people
operate hot engines and dont seem to have trouble.

hope this helps
