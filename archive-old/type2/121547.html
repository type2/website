Subject: Re: [T2] Polarity reversal on 68 Bus.. (oops)

&gt;This one has me perplexed.  Currently I obviously get negative voltage at 
&gt;thefuse block. So I am wondering, is it safe to simply 'reverse' the 
&gt;battery cables back to where they should be after running it for afew days 
&gt;in reverse polarity?  Does anyone know why this would even  run when 
&gt;hooked up backwards let alone not explode into a ball of sinder?  Last 
&gt;time I did something this boneheaded I nearly blew my jeep up. :)
&gt;thanks.

I did this to my Beetle on a bet with a friend that the starter would run 
backwards... It didn't and the car ran just fine.

I reversed the connections and nothing was hurt. With a generator you may 
need to polarize it...

Am I correct in assuming the reason the starter runs the same direction no 
matter what is b/c it is a shaded pole motor? Anyone? Frye? Anyone? &lt;grin&gt;
