Volks,

I am helping a friend with a vehicle that he installed Weber 40's in.  =
They are in an early vanagon air cooled.

Well anyway, he &quot;t&quot;ed the fuel line right before the right =
carb.....shouldn't the fuel line &quot;T' be more between the two carbs?  It =
seems like the flow would not be right with this setup...........The =
left side does not seem to be functioning well and he has cleaned the =
idle circuits to no avail..  He does not have a synchronizer, or he =
could more easily see what is happening.  It seems like (from his =
description) like that side is not firing. =20

Trying to sort out those things that we assumed were ok............
