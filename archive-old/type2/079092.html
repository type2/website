Subject: Re: [T2] Engine woun't start

AFM Adjustment : Turn adjuster screw down = richer,  back the screw out=
leaner.
Start by turning it down for full rich, back it out four full turns, that
has been a good starting point for me.
New engines with hydraulic lifter are hard to start. Disconnect the coil
wire, turn the engine over until you get the idiot light to go out (oil
Pres). Do this five or six times giving your starter a break.
Your hydraulic lifters should be set to 1 turn down from just touching.
Or .060 for solids.
***************[ Engine break in]******************
Install 20/50 Wt engine oil, new oil filter.
Run the engine at 2000 RPMs for about twenty minutes. It will take a
while for the lifters and everything to settle in so you'll have noise,
smoke and stink.
Change the oil and filter after this 20 minute run in.
Drive the vehicle at 2000 RPMs or less for 200 miles. Change the oil,
filter and clean the strainer.
Install 20/50 wt oil.
Drive the vehicle another 600 to 800 miles keeping the engine at less
than 2000 RPMs and change the oil and filter again.
You should check your lifter setting at this time and check for any oil
leaks.
After you've got this break in done you should wait about 5000 to 8000
miles before you go onto the higher quality synthetic oils.
 
Go get em!

&gt;     Hello Volks,
&gt; 
&gt; Today i've finally putted the engine of my 1969 bus in it's place 
&gt; after
&gt; assenbling new cilinder's, pistons, valves and guides and the only 
&gt; problem
&gt; fonded after spending allloooooottt of time working in it, it simply 
&gt; doesn't
&gt; start. I've been looking in the archive but i'm having problems with 
&gt; it. I
&gt; suspect it is an timing or mixture problem. What is the best way to 
&gt; set the
&gt; timing just right and that mixture is good ot what else could it 
&gt; be?
