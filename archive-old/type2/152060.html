I learned to weld in the dark ages with gas,  hadn't welded in many years
until I got tired of paying someone to do all the welding on my bus.
bought a MIG welder and decided on an auto darkening helmet....well the
Mig practically made welding easier (I'm still not that good) but the
helmet had to have been the best money I ever spent in tools for the bus.
well maybe not quite as important as a 13mm wrench but not much.

take the hint, get an auto darkening helmet....!
