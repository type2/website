Subject: Whirring noise in back
Content-Disposition: inline

&gt;   The noise isn't quite like a fan noise either can't quite explain it
&gt;though. Maybe more of a purr than a whirr? Not quite  but close to the sound
&gt;of an air compressor running in the distance but a little faster. It makes
&gt;the noise in both acc. and run if that helps.
&gt;Ed

It might be the electric fuel pump. could you have a 1975 brain box swapped in to
a later 2 liter bus?
