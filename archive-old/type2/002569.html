Subject: bus toy sighting/part needed
Date: Thu, 21 Dec 2000 02:29:09 -0500

Strolling (ok, I was being shoved by strangers) through the toy section at
my local Wally world I came across a toy I haven't seen before.  It was a
bus that was drag raced out.  Lowered, painted, even had a spoiler.  I don't
know if it was cast or plastic but it was about 10&quot; long and fairly heavy.
I was kind of in a hurry (not really, I was scared of rabid shoppers) so I
didn't look to see if it was a bay or a split.  If anyone wants me to get a
more detailed description I will.

OBC:  Anyone know where to get the plastic tube at the rear of the engine
that connects the two sides of heating air duct to the alternator?  Mine was
partially melted by the PO (don't ask how, he was probably trying to make a
pipe out of it or something), and with temps surprisingly in the 30s, I
suddenly find myself wishing I had a good heating system.  I don't have time
to go junkyarding, so if anyone has a parts Vanagon or knows of somewhere
else to get 'em, I would appreciate it.

Happy Holidays
