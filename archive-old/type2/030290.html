&gt;      I'm curious if you noticed how much push-pull play you have on the

The rear bearing stack is basically the inside of the stub axle, inner
bearing, big spacer, short spacer(inside roller) and the axle nut.
I dont really see how anything with axle nut torqued down could make it
looser. If anything wore and you retorqued the nut there would be even
less play. In my experience the hub is the soft part of the chain and will
take the wear. Is there a # for rear axle runout?
Have you checked the torque of the rear nut? If its loose it might
indicate some wear, check the drum etc..
