Subject: Re: [T2] Hydraulic clutch

&gt; Has anyone installed a hydraulic clutch in their Baywindow?

Chris,

I have not, but since I have both a bay and a V'gon, I have to ask,
&quot;WHY?!?!?&quot;  Over time, VW made a lot of improvements in the bus, but the
hydraulic clutch was not, IMHO, one of their more succesful efforts.

I don't really notice any difference in clutch feel between the two
systems.  So far, the hydraulic system has required fewer repairs, but I
fear the hydraulic because I cannot repair/replace it alone.  I know that
the cable clutches are subject to breakage, and have been thru my share of
roadside clutch cable replacements, but my point is that you *can* replace
the cable in less than a half hour, by yourself.  Even if you have the
right replacement part for the hydraulic system, you need two people to
bleed it.  I hate to bet on that, especially since I am usually alone when
I am on the road.
