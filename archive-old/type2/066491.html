Subject: Re: little orange seat

 &quot;Jump Seat&quot; is sometimes used to describe less-formal
&gt;seats, usually the kind that fold up to the wall or bulkhead, but
&gt;what you're describing doesn't fold up, does it? 
&gt;       Can this orange seat be turned around to face into the
&gt;back as well as into the front of the Westie? 
&gt;
I think what she is referring to is the &quot;stool&quot; that sits between the
jumpseat and the fridge on the older 73 era westy's. It can be completely
removed from the vehicle and used as a camp stool or outside of the van..or
moved to provide a walkway between the backseat and the front of the bus.

The stool is cool!!!
