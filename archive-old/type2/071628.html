Subject: Gonna Pull Motor , I Guess!!!
Message-ID: &lt;e956a6bd.245c9030_at_aol_dot_com&gt;

Well,   I have been noticing when I drive my 1970 Westy 'The Grommie&quot; .I hear 
a rubbing sound when it's in gear. I depress clutch ever so slightly, about 
1-1/2'' , not enough to engage it and it disappears. And sometimes when I 
start out in first gear , it shakes.  So I am thinking T.O. bearing or other 
clutch related problems. And that means pull the motor.

 So the few questions I have are ..... Does my diagnosis make sense ?. And if 
it is the clutch,are Sachs clutch assemblies way to go ?. Does it sound like 
flywheel might be warped?. And if I have to take off flywheel are those gland 
nuts that scary?.{ there are some scary stories in archives, maybe I'll go 
back to reading Peter Rabbitt] . And when I pull motor .what other things 
should I be looking for to replace ,fix etc.

I have only owned &quot;The Grommie&quot;  1 month , I guess here we go.. . PO had 
motor rebuilt by reputable  local machine shop 16,000 miles ago , but that 
was &quot;1989&quot; obviously he didn't drive much,but motor seems in good shape. He 
kept it well  maintained.  PO told me he replaced clutch and I assumed it was 
when, he rebuilt motor, who knows.  Any advice would be appreciated 
....Thanks
