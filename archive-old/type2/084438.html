Subject: Re: [T2] Wiring a tow lighting harness into the bus

&gt;  Need some insight on how to wire the lights of a 79 loaf to be towed.

This was EXTREMELY easy in my case:

My towing vehicle uses right turn signal, left turn signal, and both left &amp; 
right on together for brake lights.

I ran three wires and a ground from the towing vehicle to the VW.  All the 
wiring on the VW end can be done by tapping into the wires at the front 
turn signals.  Just remove the front turn signals to route the wires inside 
the body panel.  I routed the wires from under the van into the van 
interior following the path of the wire going to the horn.  The trailer 
lights connector then hangs down under the front bumper, and gets tied up 
out of sight with cable ties when not in use.

Wire #1 goes from the right turn signal of the towing vehicle to the front 
right turn signal on the VW.  I used &quot;vampire&quot; connectors to tap into the 
VW wiring at the right/left front turn signals.  Wire #2 goes from the left 
turn signal of the towing vehicle to the front left turn signal on the 
VW.  Wire #3 goes from the parking/tail lights of the towing vehicle to the 
parking lights at either right or left front on the VW.

This setup will give you red tail lights on the rear, amber right and left 
turn signals, and two amber brake lights.

I used a boat trailer wiring harness from Wal*Mart.  The installation was 
neat and clean, no cutting or drilling was required, and the work easily 
reversible.
