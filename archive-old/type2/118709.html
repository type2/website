&gt; &gt; You'll see an ICU and idle stabilizer

&gt;
&gt; That actually depends on the model year, I think.  My '76 California
&gt; has an external series resistor block.
&gt;
&gt; Were the &quot;internal&quot; resistors part of the ECU, or part of the wiring
&gt; harness?

You're undoubtedly right.  I was only thinking of the '79 model the original
poster was inquiring about, which was almost unchanged in the air-cooled
Vanagons.  The resistors were made part of the ECU.
