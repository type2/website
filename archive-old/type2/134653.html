&gt; but surprisingly not much. There was enough voltage to light my test
&gt; light.

OK now your full of it.

Seriously this could never ever ever ever ever ever happen. I am saying this 
not to hurt your feelings just so that you will look at what is really 
happening. let me tell you again, this is NOT happening. (period)

&gt;&gt; No way. I'll eat a bus.
&gt;
&gt; Well, got yer sawzall? ;-)
&gt;
&gt; I understand that it *shouldn't* happen. But it does. I duplicated it
&gt; many times, not believing it myself. I wasn't getting the full 12v,
&gt; but it wavered between 10 and 11.3v. So there's some resistance there,
