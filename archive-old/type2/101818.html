Subject: w8cc vs. w7dc spark plug pics

http://homepage.mac_dot_com/ratwell/.Pictures/MoreParts4/149-BoschPlugs.jpg

I took this photo to demonstrate the difference between W8xx and W7xx Bosch
spark plugs because it comes up once in a while and I was confused about the
heat scale myself but Mark Dearing put my straight.

Sorry this jpg is in German only but you'll get the idea.

W - size (M14 x 1.25 thread)
8 - heat range
C - electrode length
C - copper tip

Notice the W8CC plug has a recessed insulator by comparison. Don't worry
about my engine, the fouled plug came out after 10 minutes of start attempts
using starter fluid because the engine had previously sat for 4 years.
Ancient history.

I'm trying to research how to know if you have made the right plug choice
and it seems a plug reading is the only guide.  This whole hot vs. cold plug
is so confusing because a hot engine needs a cold plug and vice versa.

It's a little hard to see in the picture, darn macro mode, but a hotter W8CC
plug has a longer nose (center electrode) that protrudes from the insulator.
What's confusing is that the W8CC with it's recessed design actually has the
longer nose.  The longer the nose, the larger the surface area for heat
transfer to create the &quot;flame&quot; in the combustion chamber.  Because the nose
is shorter on the colder plug, it needs to protrude more.

The science against multi-lead electrode marketing is clear: the extra
electrodes only serve to block the flame, so stick with one lead and as it
has been said already, platinum changes the conductivity characteristics of
the circuit.

Given all this Bosch considers both 7 and 8 series to be &quot;hot&quot; style plugs
and it's subtle that one is colder than the other.

&gt; High code numbers (e.g. 7 to 10) signify &quot;hot&quot; spark plugs, that is, high
&gt; heat conduction for cold engines (e.g. VW Beetle).

Here's what I've come up with for plug readings assuming the engine starts
and runs fine (no oil fouling, mechanical damage, etc) and the FI system is
operating efficiently so it's only down to your choice of plugs.

Normal Appearance: you chose wisely
- light grey or tan deposits on insulator, slight to no electrode erosion

Carbon fouling: plug too cold, increase to W8CC
- dry black carbon all over

Pre-ignition: plug way too hot, lower to W7CC
- melted

Over heating: plug too hot, lower to W7CC
- extremely white, premature electrode erosion (rounding), bluing

This isn't the 10 commandments, I'm just trying to get some feedback here
from list-members with experience. I don't know if the difference between
these neighboring heat ranges can make this big a difference in plug
appearance in a VW but I would like to know.

Lastly, Bosch's catalog says W8CC is the right initial choice for a FI bus
which agrees with the info in the archives.  In a hot TX climate my plugs
were normal.  I'll have them again now that I've moved to the west coast and
report.
