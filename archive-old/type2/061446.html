Cam's function is the result of the change in height (radius) of the cam
lobes as the follower travels around it.  A reground cam has all
surfaces ground, say removing .010&quot; (just a guess).  The change in
height is returned to the factory specs.  The .010 loss is taken up by
adjustments in the rocker arms (valve adjustments).

Brent:  Glad that you are summarizing the responses. I too have been
disappointed when a great question apparently goes unanswered.  For
example, I have rebuilt many ac engines and have a vernier caliper
available but I have never quite understood how to measure the lobes of a
cam and decide if it needs replacement.   Mike West has a fine posting on
this but I can't quite put it together.

 I need help with your summary.  How can it be that a cam which has 0.010
removed from it ends up having &quot;factory specs&quot;?  What specs? Was not the
original cam designed to lift a rocker arm by a definite amount?  It
doesn't seem as though a reground one can possibly do this.

I would really like to resolve this point.
Thanks, Jack
