Subject: RE: [T2] Fuel Line cutoff alternative


[...]

Similar fuel line connectors can be found at any marine store or outboard motor shop.  There are a few different designs, but most are either the Mercury or OMC type.

These connectors are used on O/B motors with more HP than any A/C VW engine...

****************************

&gt;While perusing one of my motorcycle catalogs (Chapparral 
&gt;at http://www.800-841-2960_dot_com/) I saw these nifty Quick 
&gt;disconnect couplings that shut off fuel flow when you 
&gt;pull them apart. They are claimed to be compatible with 
&gt;all types of gas or racing fuel and come in 1/4(part#306-
&gt;1229 $13.99) and 5/16(part#306-1230 $14.99) sizes (kinda 
&gt;strange since most of the bikes that this catalog caters 
&gt;to are metric. They are made by Motion Pro and can 
&gt;likely be ordered through any motorcycle shop.
&gt;I haven't used one myself so no firsthand knowledge.
