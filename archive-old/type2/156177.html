Subject: Re: [T2] Exhaust Set up Advice for 71 Bus

&gt; I've heard of some installing two tailpipes on bug exhaust on a bus so
&gt; that the fumes are sent to the sides. It requires to add a bracket to
&gt; hold the right side tailpipe.

From my perspective the only good solution is to spend the 100 bucks and
put a bus exhaust in there.
I have had no long term satisfaction with any other solution be it bug
muffler or extractor.
