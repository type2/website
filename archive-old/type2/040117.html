Subject: RE: Canadian Parts Source

&gt; delays and Customs fees.  Are there any good Canadian VW parts
&gt; specialists (new car dealers excluded)?

Try www.marksbugbarn_dot_com. I haven't bought anything here but they seem to
have a fair bit.

PS to the list: I did my first tuneup over Easter weekend and took some
pictures. I should have them scanned in and thrown onto the web early next
week
