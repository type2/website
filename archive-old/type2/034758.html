Subject: Re: Rec. Vehicle or Daily Driver?

Allen,

Having and using a VW bus as a reliable daily driver is well within the
realm of posibility, and has been proven by a substantial number of people
on this list. There is certainly no need to buy an inferior vehicle (&quot;I
lean towards buying a late model american something&quot;) to satisfy the need 
for reliability. 

It won't cost an arm and a leg, but there is some expense to owning a 
dependable bus. The minimum you should budget is $5000 for purchasing the 
vehicle and bringing it up to a standard of reliability. Dokter Tim, one 
of our list gurus, puts the figure closer to $10,000. With that kind of 
money, wisely invested (and following Doktor Tim's DM), you should not 
have to carry any tools with you; you'll be warm; you'll be happy. But a 
$5000 investment is the minimum. There are several people on the list who 
have spent much less than that, but they are very lucky. 

Poke around the archives for the stuff on DM [Deutsches Methode]. That's 
the foolproof way to go. A lot of us here, however, are just a bit 
foolish (present company especially) and we like to test our luck.

Start by finding a rust-free bus, or as close to it as you can. One way 
to do this is to budget a trip to &quot;Aridzona&quot; (watch for the posts headed 
&quot;Aridzona Bus Sale&quot;) or California. But be careful there; lots of people 
have moved to the southwest from the &quot;rust belt&quot; since these buses were 
made, and have brought their little token of rust with them.

Since you are concerned about heat, spend a little time at Matthew 
Bulley's heat and noise web site (linked through the type2 library). 
There is no reason that the stock VW heat should not be sufficient; and 
with some judicious improvements, it can be more than sufficient.

Get a copy of John Muir's infamous &quot;idiot book.&quot; Read the section toward 
the beginning on how to buy an aircooled vehicle: what to look for, what 
to test, etc. Unless you plan to install a rebuilt engine as a matter of 
course, be sure to check the engine compression. Not everything Muir says 
in the rest of the book is the gospel truth, but his advice about how to 
check out a vehicle is fairly sound.

Meanwhile, spend some time in the archives. And if you have questions 
that the archives don't answer (or don't answer definitively), feel free 
to ask the list. We are very tolerant and welcoming of newbies here, as 
long as you don't misspell too many words (note: gauge=gauge), send posts 
in upper case, or ask questions about oil or tires.

Good luck.
