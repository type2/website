Follow up:
I checked the aux air regulator the way Bentley suggests - thanks for =
place to start Tom!!

Results: first the boot that connects the reg. and the hose to the air =
intake was split. Using tape and a clamp I did the best I could to fix =
this ( I will buy a new one). Any time disconected the hose from the aux =
air reg. to the air intake the bus stalled even when=20
the bus was running for a while and warm - seems like this means that it =
is not closing

The ohm test mentioned in Bentley passed 30-31 ohms

So did the current test - positive to one side and negative to the other =
of the connection that goes to the aux. air reg. produced voltage.

Could the switch part be OK but the mechanical not?
I think I will try one I pulled in a junk yard and see what happens

Also when Bently says pull the cold start with fuel lines still =
conected, and turn over it will pump gas if it is working proprerly and =
the ambeint temp is cold  - correct??

&gt;Not sure what you're saying. The connector is two prong on my '79 =
california: 1. signal from the brain(?) and  2. the ground &gt;at the c.s. =
injector. Mine is still well sheathed so I can't see if there's two =
wires connected to one pin. Is this what you're &gt;asking?
 Yes I am saying two wires are connected to one pin and one wire to the =
other pin.=20
