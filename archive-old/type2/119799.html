Subject: Re: [T2] ECU :What is the Difference?

&gt; I went throught this with a local rebuilder- - he claimed the earlier
&gt; AFM in a higher capacity engine will draw more air (flap open more) and
&gt; the ECU will give the right increased amount of gas for this.  I also
&gt; intuitively differered,  seeing the AFM as a mechanical vacuum drawn
&gt; variable potentiometer that must be different at full throttle for the
&gt; 75 vs 78, as the 78 will be drawing more MAX air.....

The maximum amount of air the 1975 AFM and ECU expect to see drawn is
1800cc's.  As a result the ECU is &quot;programmed&quot; (I understand it is analog)
to deliver the correct amount of fuel for 1800cc's of air at wide open
throttle.  If you use this system on an engine that is actually drawing
2000cc's of air then that 1800cc's worth of gas will not be enough and the
fuel mixture will be lean.

&gt; Then again, can't one just move the spring control screw to adjust
&gt; this inherent leaness?

You can adjust the spring tension but you cannot adjust the signal length
of the injector pulse from the ECU (without a soldering gun and more
knowledge of electronics than I possess).  With stock injectors open for
the maximum pulse you get the correct amount of fuel for 1800cc's of air.
On a 2000cc block this is not enough gas.  You can work around this by
replacing the injectors with injectors using a larger orifice but now you
are in FI never-never land.  This is not a task to be approached at home.
You will need an EGA and it would be very nice to have a dyno handy.

&gt; BTW, does it get leaner or richer if you tighten this screw?

Which screw?  The idle bypas screw?  As you close it you get less air at
idle and a richer mix at idle.  It has some effect at higher RPMs but not
a lot.

&gt; I'd guess that looser is richer, as our tired 244,000mi all original
&gt; components engine looks to be a tad rich based on exhaust pipe sooty
&gt; coating.

Are you sure that at 244,000 miles there might not be a bit of oil burning
and causing that soot?

&gt; In our case, he rebuilt a stock 75 in daughter's bus to stock specs,
&gt; but wanted to put a 78 FI harness/AFM/ECU in as the 75 has inherent
&gt; weaknesses (the control on the throttle housing, lack of air temp
&gt; sensor).  -Now if you are right, would such a switch make the 75 run
&gt; RICH?

No, the '78 FI will run more or less correctly on a 75 block.  It will
just never reach its full throttle position and will never inject 2000cc's
worth of gas since the 1800cc engine will never demand it.

I am torn on whether your mechanic is correct in recommending the
&quot;upgrade&quot; to the '78 system.  There is no inherent defect in the '75
system other than it will not work correctly on a 2L block.  Since the
stock '75 engine is an 1800 block this is not an issue.  There may be
parts availability problems since the '75 system had a number of one-year
parts but if the system is there and functional I would stick with it.

                             OOK!
