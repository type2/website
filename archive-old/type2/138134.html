Subject: Re: [T2] wiring harness for a 83 2000cc aircool engine (where
  to buy)

No such critter, to the best of my knowledge. Again, the first thing to 
do is to use the archives. Search under &quot;FI&quot; and &quot;harness&quot; and (maybe) 
&quot;source.&quot; You will see that we've had a lot to say about this.
