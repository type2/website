Subject: Re: life expectancy of muffler

I have a Monza muffler, came with the car. Receipts show it was purchased
in 86. This week, I need to braze shut a crack where the outlet tubes meet
the body on one side, and close up a hole where the clamps cut thru the
flange. Otherwise, still fine.
Then again, I live in Texas - no salt (well, ok, not here in Austin... bus
was a Galveston bus before 86; LOTS of rust in my rockers &amp; wells...).
