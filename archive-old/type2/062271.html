Subject: &quot;-ellis\&quot; must unsub on friday... &lt;no vw content&gt;

The company is reconfigging it's email access. I just received word from my
company's main office that all inbound SMTP (Internet) e-mail will be
blocked from the company network due to a coversion to the glorious cc:mail
app. Oh joy. Therefore my current Internet e-mail address &lt;
jim_at_atcweb.atc.1dc_dot_com &gt; will no longer work after Saturday. I will
officially unsub from this the vanagon and type2 mail lists as of 17:00
Friday 8/30/96. I will still participate in the two lists/digest mode via
the home account at the &lt; vanbondo_at_primenet_dot_com &gt; email address. I'll see ya
all around from that account.
