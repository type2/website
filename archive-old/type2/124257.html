Subject: Re: [T2] Wires go to where?

&gt; There are two wires coming from my FI wiring harness. They are white and
 have covered female spade connectors on each. I can make out the red
 numbering on the wires, barely. One says 12 the other says 40 I think. They
 exit the harness at the front (FIF) right corner of the engine compartment.
 I can't seem to find anything to plug them into...well my mouth but they
 don't taste good and I want to get everything connected.

About 6&quot; from the ECU plug, they come out as an even pair, and are about 4&quot; long?

If yes, they go no where. They are for the high altitude switch that USA buses never had.
The other end of them just end at the ECU. The USA ECU has no circuit for them. They disappeared from the
harness's in mid 78.
