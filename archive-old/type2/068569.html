Subject: Bay Window Off Road Gear Ratios

I would like some input from anyone who has ever built or
driven a bay with 091 tranny set up for a bit more off the
road play.  Having given up hope of a Syncro for the moment,
I am turning to the much neglected '78 and thinking seriously
about a Lock-Right and at least a lower 1st gear, or possibly a
lower R&amp;P with an overdrive 4th though the stock 4.57 is also
the strongest ratio I believe, at the moment I'm thinking toward
about an extra 1.5&quot; of ground clearance ala a Bus Boys beam and
rear suspension raise, I'm already gathering parts to warm the
2.0 over to something a tad bigger but still F.I.  I've been
talking with Chris Weddle but seek anyones real world experience
with tranny matters.  I feel with the Lock-Right traction will not
be a problem, but the stock 1st seems too high particularly compared
to Syncro and 5 spd L which I work out to like 13mph at 4000 rpm,
now thats LOW.  But I don't want this thing to be a bear and undriveable
on the highway either, with only 4 gears its going to
be tough.  Anyway, anyone with input particularly on strength and
longetivity please advise.
