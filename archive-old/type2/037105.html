     Ad Reads 1978 VW Bus, Still runs, selling for parts, $500
(208)346-6820

     If know one is interested, but might need parts let me know, I
might buy it to part out.

     It is located in Basalt, Id, About 45 miles from pocatello, were Im
at. 

     I went and looked at this yesterday, the motor has a knocking rod,
the fuel pump is missing. That is all that is really bad about this bus.
there is some rust, but not that bad. The nose has some bondo, and
cracks in the bondo. But over all the body is not in bad shape. the
interior is in decent shape, the front two seats need redone, the middle
and rear bench seats are in good shape. It has a tow bar that goes with
it. This would make a good daily driver if you had a motor to go in it
or if you rebuilt the one in it. Or it would be good for a parts bus. I
have no connection with this bus or the owner, I just don't want to see
it destroyed, or crushed.

If any more questions let me know.
Thanks
