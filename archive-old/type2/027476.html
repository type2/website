&gt;Re: [T2] My New Westy!!
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;  Being new to VW's...
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;  What is
&gt;? How do you detect, and fix it?
&gt;
&gt;In China Cat (75 Westy) it was on the outside...in the front wheel wells. 
&gt;The
&gt;large bracket shaped roughly like an upside-down ham were rusty all round 
&gt;the
&gt;bottom beam and up in front of the snubber boss that sticks out. the lower
&gt;beam would have come adrift it the wheel hit a hard bump.
&gt;
&gt;Check 'em carefully, mate :-)
&gt;
&gt;Cheers/Carron

cool,you got a westy!....most beam rot occurs where the torsion tubes mount 
to the vertical peice that connects them (and where the top of the shock 
mounts)....something about welds which heats up the metal making it more 
prone to rust....i imagine you do not live in new england where the roads 
are smothered in NaCl by the ton or you would not be driving a 30 year old 
car..as they have all dissolved away up there....any way just crawl under 
the front of your bus and you can see the entire front end beam..after you 
take off the sheet metal splash guard, if it is still there....alot of 
people make up a mix of half kerosene and half oil and spray the entire beam 
and underside of the car with it...(wrap your rubber brake lines with tape 
first)...in Mexico, VWs are sprayed on the underside once a year with oil to 
keep them from rusting.....best wishes..blane...
