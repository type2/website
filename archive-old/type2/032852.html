Subject: More on '76-'78 heat exchangers

There are a lot of posts this time of year about making repairs and 
upgrades for better heat. Having taken my '76 heat exchangers apart for 
some work, I have learned the following, which I have not seen discussed 
here.

The core of each exchanger takes up a lot of room inside that metal box. 
Inevitably, over time, the sheet metal covers take a beating -- they get 
dinged and dented, especially in the corners. Every ding decreases the 
volume of air can pass through the exchanger at a given time. A dent is a 
restriction. 

There are two aspects to getting heat out of these systems. The first is 
to keep the air inside the system isolated from the cold air outside. 
That has been addressed dozens of times here. The other is to move as 
much air as possible through the system. I suspect that in many cases, 
simply taking the exchangers apart, spending some time with a hammer and 
dolly, and putting them back together will restore flow and obviate the 
need for a &quot;bilge blower&quot; up front.
