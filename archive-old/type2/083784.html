Subject: Some Questions about hoses and other basic Items...

--0-842681758-1022615956=:40128


Hello All,

I am new to this list and I hope that you may be able to give me a hand.

I am currently redoing the drivetrain in my 1973 VW Camper (Westy). I have rebuilt the 003 VW Automatic Transmission, got a rebuilt torque converter, replaced all fuel lines (clamps to),  and about to reinstall the drivetrain but I have run into a few snags and I have a few questions. 

1) Does anybody have a hose/emission diagram for my westy? The hoses are cracked, disconnected and plugged from previous owner? I would like to correct the hoses to the best of my ability.

2) The engine has not been started in about 10 years but did run fine when I parked it and engine has been stored indoors. Engine turns and seems to be fine. Oil will be changed as well as all the vehicles filters. Is there anything I should do before I restart it to avoid any problems?

3) I have not had a chance to check the Bentley but does anybody know which sensor is which?The oil temp and oil pressure, I have two wires coming out of the engine (1776) hooked to two seperate sensors. Which sensor is closest to the back of the vehicle if the engine is installed? Also does anybody also know what color wires should be hooked to these senors?

Thanks for all your help in advance,

Chris
