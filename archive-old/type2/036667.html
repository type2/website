Subject: All is well that ends well

Folks,

Just replaced the valve cover gaskets on my '78 bus. Spent an hour or so
removing the sealing compound that the last person to do this job used.

Having done this, I loaded the my kids (and a few neighbor kids) into the
bus to do some errands. At the first stop, I realized that I was leaking oil
all over the place.

Not wanting to disappoint the kids by turning around to work on the bus, I
stopped at a Shell Station in Sterling, Virginia to ask for a quick hand. As
I was waiting, 2 more VW busses pulled into the gas station. They were on
there way home from a gathering in Leesburg, Virginia.

As it turns out, my problem was not nearly so severe as I thought. I put one
of the valve covers on crooked.

As is well that ends well. Also glad to meet other type2 owners.
