Subject: 75 Automatic Camper

hello,

there is a 75 Automatic Camper for sale not far from
my house. i am seriously considering buying it. does

willing to share with me any info that might aid in my
decision. pertanent to the automatic aspect.

stuff, rockers, fenders, beam axle, etc and thsi bus
seems solid.
