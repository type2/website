I am confused.  On my type 4 engines with the plastic timing scale, ATDC
looks to be to the right of the TDC mark, after the notch on the fan has
passed the TDC mark on the timing scale.  But, when I look at the bently
book, and any other description of a type 1 upright engine, where the case
seam is used, things seem to be the opposite.  I hope this is correct.
