Subject: RE: [T2] truckers, buses, PLF

  I just talked to Gene a passenger in the high roof (towing the container
van). They were going 40 to 45 miles an hour up a 3% grade out of Quartzite
AZ. They had lights on the towed vehicle. The speed in AZ is 75 mph for
anything on the road, even semis. Nobody has been able to figure out exactly
why or what happened it all went so fast. More will come out in the future
as the DPS investigates what happened.
  The main thing is that they are all OK, but a little sore. The worse part
is there is now 1 less highroof and 1 less container van, there used to be 4
known, now 3 and a scrape pile of another.

Bob,

from what I can put together, the highroof was towing a SC w/ cargo box on
it. 4-5 people in the lead vehicle, both loaded with stuff from
octo/classic.

As David S. pointed out, how fast could they have been going? Perhaps 35?

If the trucker was doing 10 miles over the maximum (65max for trucks?) 
and the buses were going 15 under the minimum 
(yes there is one)
who's at fault?

This one might be a loser for the vdub folk.

Billy

&gt;did the trucker give any rationale???
