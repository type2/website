Subject: FI has me stumped; maybe time to convert to a carb? :P
Message-ID: &lt;Pine.SOL.3.96.981017190435.16807B-100000_at_techsrv1.tech.mtu_dot_edu&gt;

First off, let me set the stage:  1975 van, 1977 2.0L engine, everything
stock except for no EGR system.

I've got a problem with my fuel injection that's really got me stumped. 
I'm kinda up a creek here; my mechanic is sick of it and refuses to touch
it anymore.  It'll run absolutely great until the engine gets good and
warmed up, then it cuts out suddenly with no warning, just like someone
flipped a switch.  Then it refuses to restart.  This has already cost me
two tows.  My first thought was the cylinder head temp. sensor, but it
checks out and is well-seated in the head.  This is really frustrating me,
especially since nearly every time this van has stranded me it's been an
FI problem. :P

So I'm beginning to wonder if I'd be best served by converting to
carburation.  A search of the archives, however, indicates that apparently
noone's ever got a single Weber progressive to actually run right,
especially not in cold weather.  I can't afford $600 or whatever it is for
a dual carb setup.  What are my options?  Anyone have any suggestions on
getting the FI running again?  Or thoughts on a *good* carb conversion?
