Subject: re:Anyone have a spare weber single?? (FI reversion update)

Hi Bob,

NOTE: People can stop sending me offers weber singles. I am NOT 
interested in a weber single, I am interested in making the bus run on 
FI.

Sorry if I didn't make that clear enough. It was late at night and my 
irony meter may have been poorly calibrated.

&gt; FI installs can be tricky, but here is one case when Doc Tim is really
&gt; righht on the money, follow the trouble shooting guide, if you don't 
&gt; have
&gt; one it is in the library, or drop me a private e-mail and we can figure
&gt; out how to get you a copy

I gotta mention here that I was really surprised when Doktor Tim's only 
response was to offer to sell me a non-stock part. But in this case DM 
makes assumptions about all parts being equal and I know that is not 
necessarily the case. Which is probably why the Doktor has opted out of 
FI reversion assistance. Sigh.

I went out this afternoon and swapped in the fuel pressure regulator 
from the sunroof bus. The I verified that I am getting a decent spray 
from injectors on 1,2 &amp; 3. Last night I assumed that #4 was 
representative of all the others, but I now know that is not the case.  
Injector #4 refuses to fire, even when I use the wire from #3.  So I 
swapped in a different injector and it too refuses to fire.  I might 
just have a dud spare, but there are more where that came from, I'll 
update on that situation soon.

I called Dennis Jolliffe and verified the firing order from the 
distributor out. It turned out that I had 1-2 and 3-4 plug wires 
reversed. I also had the plugs to the thermo time switch and aux air 
intake reversed. When I assembled the engine I couldn't see the color 
codes on the plugs, so I guessed on their position based on the length 
of the leads. Wrongly.

After that I was able to get it to start.

It still won't idle though. It will light up  but will only run 
briefly. If I play with the throttle I can keep it running, but only at 
high revs. Adjusting the timing helps a little, but not much. The 
inability to idle can't be helped by a dead number 4 injector, so I 
will head back to the driveway now to try swapping in another spare. I 
am also going to get a fuel pressure gauge on it ASAP.

Feels better to know I am getting closer. It sure sounds a lot better 
now that the exhaust manifold is bolted up properly.

Happy trails,

&gt;&gt; The engine was recently re-assembled after pulling the 1-2 head to 
&gt;&gt; have
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; I have gathered and installed a complete group of FI components.  I
&gt;&gt; have a 7-wire AFM. The ECU has an orange sticker on it. Everything is
&gt;&gt; bolted up tight, and all the vacuum lines are present and accounted
&gt;&gt; for.. I haven't put a fuel gauge on it but I have verified fuel flow.
&gt;&gt; The EGR has been removed and capped off at the plenum. I am getting a
&gt;&gt; nice juicy spark at the plugs. I am NOT getting fuel spray from the
&gt;&gt; injectors.
&gt;
&gt; ah hah!
&gt; .   have you checked the double relay????
&gt; .   have you checked that the trigger circuit is firing the injectors
&gt; .   is the resistor pack good
&gt;
&gt; hook a simple circuit tester light or VOM across one of the injector 
&gt; plugs
&gt; and see if it &quot;flickers&quot;
&gt;
&gt;&gt; single wire from the FI harness to the coil is firmly attached to the
&gt;&gt; negative side.
&gt;
&gt; terminal #1  right
