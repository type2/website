Hello Guys    The rope way is only if youm don't have air . We did the whole 
job in less than an hour probably would take that long just to get the rope in 
there. Anyway it looks like the heads he got from Rimco must have had a bad 
or pitted valve spring but he's on the road again running good and starting  
later and have fun  Mark Dearing    Salem Import Service Salem, Va
