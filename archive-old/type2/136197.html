Subject: Re: [T2] Chat about Richard Atwell's restoration 

&gt; When I proposed this, Richard started talking irc channel chat, which
&gt; came out &quot;blah, blah, blah&quot; when I read it. But I'm willing to learn. I
&gt; thought maybe we could just do it on the list (couldn't cost any more
&gt; bandwidth than the perennial &quot;what kind of oil do you use?&quot; thread).

dont forget irc.type2_dot_com
the usual channel was #buslist which is all but deserted recently.
you could always make another channel. its private which takes a lot of
the annoyance out of the irc chat.

i stop in now and again but lately have found just tumbleweeds.....
