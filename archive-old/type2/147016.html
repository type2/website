Subject: Re: [T2] VDO oil temp sender drain plug, Redux

&gt;Has anyone
&gt;successfully installed a VDO 323055 drain plug oil sender in a 1600 upright
&gt;engine fitted with a stock oil screen, and if so, how in the blast did you
&gt;manage it?

I drilled an offset hole in the sump plate.  IIRC for the one I had, the instructions had a diagram of where to do this? and also a thin nut to anchor the sender on the inside.  I sealed the install with JBWeld.
