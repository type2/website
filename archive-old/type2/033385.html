Subject: Second/Spare Battery-Another Idea

In all the talk I've seen on both lists about adding a second battery, with 
the wiring, isolator switch, which alternator you need, etc., I don't believe 
I've ever seen this idea posted, which is what I did for my Westy. For 50 
bucks I got one of those portable rechargable batteries from PriceCostco. 
It's fairly small, has a cigarette lighter type plug for running accessories, 
and lasts a good amount of time on a charge. I take it along when camping, 
just using my one battery without worrying about running it down ( it also 
has jumper cable ends on it), because if I do, I just hook up the portable to 
start the camper. Also, if you need to give someone else a jump, you don't 
have to worry about getting the vehicles close together OR possible damage to 
your electrical system. Anyway, it works well for me, thought I'd pass it on.
