&gt; very true. only problem is it won't indicate that the 2nd battery is

&gt; I have several things running off my 2nd battery I'm gonna bite the

Eh, I think a simple circuit that would illuminate an LED if the fuse 
was blown when you turn on the ignition switch shouldn't be that hard 
to rig up.

&gt;&gt; It's probably useful to stick an ammeter in the circuit if you're 
&gt;&gt; doing
&gt;&gt; any sort of repair (or fresh installation) work on your battery
&gt;&gt; isolator set-up, because then you can see *exactly* what is going on.
&gt;
&gt; just fyi. unless it's a very good ammeter it will burn out any of the
&gt; vom style. these only will accept small current flow. not 90 amps.

Yah, I wouldn't suggest a VOM... but rather get one capable of 30 amps 
or so from an electronics supply store ... the simple panel-mounted 
type.  I would go so far as to mount it permanently in the isolator 
circuit so I could monitor it by lifting the engine lid.  I don't have 
the faintest idea how much a meter like that would cost, though...
