Subject: Hydraulic Valve Adjustment
To: type2_at_bigkitty.azaccess_dot_com (IPM Return Requested)
Message-Id: &lt;&quot;981116215704Z.WT00886. 24*/PN=Brian.S.Hoare/OU=C367320/OU=SLLN/O=McDonnell Douglas/PRMD=MDC/ADMD=TELEMAIL/C=US/&quot;_at_MHS&gt;

I attempted to adjust the hydraulic valves on my '79 bus this weekend
and discovered a spongy #2 exhaust lifter. Apparently, I adjusted it too
tight, because I hear clicking from that side now. 

How can I get this lifter to pump up before I readjust the valve?

1) Should I back the adjuster off, warm up the engine until the lifter
pumps up, then readjust the valve? 
2) This would then be a warm engine, do I need to let it go stone
cold again before I try the adjustment?
3) Does a spongy lifter mean that I need a new one?
