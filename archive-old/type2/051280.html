Subject: [T2] Clutch lever arm

Hi,
My clutch pedal suddenly dropped a few inches as I was heading home. I got a
replacement and proceeded to install it. I found that the adjustment allowed
no more turns at the lever arm at the case but that the cable had not broken
anywhere. Can a cable stretch so much as to take up all the adjustment? The
clutch has only 10k miles and the cable as well. I did find some freeplay in
the arm itself but do not know if this is normal. Is it possible that the
cable was too long to begin with? Are there different lengths and the
mechanic put the wrong one in? Is the lever adjustable?
