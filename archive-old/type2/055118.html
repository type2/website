When you buy the bus, make sure he has the papers (title, etc) and it matches 
the numbers on the van... not the lic. plate, but the VIN (on the dash, 
drivers side)...

I once bought this really cool Corvair, ran good, kinda beat but OK, for 
$300.  Didn't do that, and ended up buying a stolen vehicle.  Of course, the 
seller could not be found after that, but the saddest part was I lost my car.

So make sure you have the title, and the VIN matches... otherwise it could be 
the best deal in the world, but it'll be money down the drain.  If it does, 
go for it!

When you arise in the morning, give thanks for the food and the joy of 
living.  If you see no reason for giving thanks, the fault lies only in 
yourself.  Abuse no one and nothing, for abuse turns the wise ones into fools 
and robs the spirit of it's vision.
