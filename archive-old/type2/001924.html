Hi List once again, thanks for the tips on the water on the floor. I have
had my door panels off as I have made new ones out of birch. The pasenger
side still has the plastic cover inside but my drivers door didnt so I water
proofed the birch and insulated the doors using bubble rap that had aluminum
foil as the sides. Its available at Home Depots and seemed to work on
cutting road noise down for me. I suspect its coming from my turn signal
indicators tho because I can barley see a seal in there. I also noticed I
need new side window rubber because mine just cracks off.
But my new project for the Bus this spring is to make a rack of some kind to
put my fishing poles up and out of the way. Right above the back hatch I
have a white plastic covering which seems to just cover the hinges? I was
thinking of removing this and making a nice wooden rack with a round door to
put my poles in. Any other ideas?
Another question, my Bus is a 74 Westy with a dual carb 1800cc set up. It
even had the original smog gear on it and still functioning when I bought it
last year. But my last mech removed it and gave it back to me. Does this
engine have self adjusting valves? I know I need to read my Haynes or
Muir,but I'm a tinkerer not a mech. Thanks for reading my ramblings.

todd 74 Westy
