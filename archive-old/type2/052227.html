Subject: Re: Re: [T2] 69 Westy questions

&gt; 1) Is there supposed to be chrome outside trim strips in any of the 
&gt; window  rubber?
No
&gt; 2) Will the window from a 67 rear hatch fit the 69? Is there a rear 
&gt; defogger on the 69? 
Yes it will fit. per Kyle Tillman of Westfailure fame. He has a bay window rear glass. Even got the defrost rigged up. Most but not all bays had rear defrost. Seems like those without tend to be kombis which you have.
&gt; 3) It\'s a 1600 SP. Is the engine tin different from bug engine tin 
&gt; fron the same year?
The tin is the same with the exception of the front tin. The front tin on 1968 to 1970 buses is straight across the top and the bug is curved. 
&gt; 4)....I need the driver\'s side rear side 
&gt; window (the one with the vent wing, but I have the wing)
Forget that nasty leaking wing window. Get the glass from the right rear and use is on the left side. The logo on the glass will be inside out but your bus will fair better in the long run. 

Good chioce of bus. I hope you enjoy it.\\
