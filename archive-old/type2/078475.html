Subject: 71 Westy Rear Seat/Bed Question

I'm trying to get this bus in shape and I've discovered that 1) the =
catches on the sides of the rear seat have been partially broken off and =
2) the latches that secure the seat down have nowhere to latch to.  Does =
anyone have pictures or drawings of these pieces that would help me to =
fabricate these?  For the side catches, I've got a bar of aluminum that =
I'm going to make replacement part out of, but I just need some sort of =
template to go by.  It appears that there is a notch that mates with a =
stud coming out of the seat bracket, as well as a smaller hole.  Does =
the smaller hole have a function?
