Subject: Re: How about posts of best &quot;workarounds&quot;?

CV's kept falling off the wheel...until I figured out
to NOT use anti-seize and to install the OEM
lockwashers (dirt cheap from the VW dealer). And give
'em a little extra torque...  ;0)

So I'm stranded at jack-in-the-box, with just one
mangled bolt (the others had fallen off). Didn't have
the tool, so I couldn't borrow from the other side. 
Ended up retracing my route on foot for about 3/4
mile, plucking CV bolts out of the street while
dodging traffic.  3 or 4 bolts finger-tight got me
home.
