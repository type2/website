Subject: Those bleedin' brakes!

Hello list...
Ever heard the saying that the wise swim in waters where fools drown?
I'm drowning here.
After long term storage, I've attempted to bleed the brakes, starting with 
the furthest from the master. The back 2 bleed some dirty fluid, some rust, 
but no air.
BUT, the front bled a little rust, AND big bubbles of air followed by 
millions of tiny bubbles. Every time, no matter what we've tried.
A big bubble or two comes out every time we open-pump-close-release.
The master linkage is to it's 1mm spec as well.
The system isn't leaking anywhere, and even after adjusting the drum pads on 
all 4 wheels to microns before scraping, the peddle goes past half way to 
the floor. I've got good fat pads all around, no leaks and no clue.
I've read the 4 manuals I have - Bently, Muir, Haynes and Clymer, but 
nothing about this that I can find.
Need I power-bleed?
Master problems?
Bleeding order incorrect?
The one thing I haven't done is pump, as Muir says, 50 or 60 times.
Thanks
Duane
