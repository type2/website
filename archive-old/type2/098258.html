Subject: Re: [T2] Stinky heat

	Yuck! I still remember the oddly evil smell another child's parent's
Corvair station wagon had when I was in 4th grade... worst stinky heat
I ever smelled. Car was newish too, this was in 1966. I never smelled
anything so bad in a VW. 

	My recollection is that Type 4 engines have an electric fan
that blows fresh air into the heat exchangers- so the blower
can be turned off, as opposed to Type 1/2 (upright fan shroud)
where the design presumes fresh air is always been blown
through the heat exchangers. If you turn the blower off for
the first 10-15 minutes of operation, to let things get
really hot, then turn it on for the rest of the trip, I would
think that would promote faster burn-off of the oil in the
heat exchanger. Its a crummy problem and I wish you luck. I
live in Oakland and didn't have my heat exchangers hooked up
for a while. Not only was it cold, the front windshield tended to
fog up. :( So carry some hand towels or something else to wipe
down with.

	Bill
