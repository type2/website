Subject: Re: [T2] Mythbusters show related to why engine lid should stay

Mine B said:

I'm sure Georgle Lyle will step in here- but since the air dropping from our
vertical back wall also rolls against the ground, this will create DRAG!

in response to what anymouse wrote:

So, our buses are being PUSHED from the back by this airflow?? And the
faster I go, the more I am being PUSHED?!?!?

Then Anymouse pops back with:

Is this DRAG sufficient to counter the PUSH effect??  Or is it PUSHING above
the bumper line and DRAGING below the bumper line.


There is a quirk with US rail road trains, in that one part of the train is
always going backwards, while the majority of the train is going forward.
Is this what we are seeing here with the VW?!?!?
