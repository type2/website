Eric --
Also not sure about the cable question.  I recommend Heckmann &amp; Thiemann at
SE 25th &amp; Powell in Portland for all your VW service needs. I've been
taking my VWs there for almost 10 years now.  They are professionals and
are the best.  Halsey Automotive at about NE 78th and Halsey is a great
place for VW parts, as well.
