Subject: Re: [T2] bleeder valves

&gt; I tried unsuccessfully yesterday to open my rear bleeder valves on my 71
&gt; before I switched out the hoses. I squirted them down with some rust
&gt; penetrator ahead of time let them sit a few hours and still couldn't get them
&gt; open. I gave up trying to apply too much pressure for fear of stripping them.
&gt; Any ideas what I could do to get these little buggers off? Would a light
&gt; torch help? I dont want to replace the back lines just to find out I cant
&gt; bleed them and will be screwed.

Melissa
I would just go for it. There is a chance it will break off. Ive
had a couple old crusty ones break and at that point I just replace the
wheel cylinder. I always keep a set of new spare wheel cylinders so if I
discover a leaky one or break a bleeder I have the new one in hand.
