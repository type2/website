Subject: Re: [T2] trying to do my rear brakes and need help!

Hi Beth,
Have you tried heating up the lug nuts a bit?  Taking a torch to them and
then soaking them with various lubricants seems to work for me...that or even
tapping on them with a hammer sometimes works..._dot_dead blow hammer even. Are
they rusted on...or did someone use an air wrench on them?  Maybe just try
using a bigger 4-way on them?
As for the brake spring tool....no, you really don't *need* one.  I've never
used one, although I'm sure it would probably be easier with one.  As long as
you have a tight grip and a pair of long needle nosed pliers you should be
ok.  Thats the way that I always do it anyways....

Good luck!

&gt;  I cannot even losen my lug nuts!  I have sprayed WD40
&gt; on them and this stuff called PB blaster and so far nothing is working.
&gt;   The other thing is, a friend of mine told me I need to have a
&gt; special &quot;sping removal&quot; tool otherwise I will not be able to get the
&gt; springs off. Is this true?
