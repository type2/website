Subject: Re: [T2] RE: AC Delco Alternator

&gt; New York City has just placed orders for 230+ Orion VII hybrid buses, these
&gt; buses have a small diesel engine driving an alterantor and charging a bank
&gt; of batteries, there is a single electric motor driving the rear axles thru a
&gt; fairly standard drive train, which will drive the motor as a generator when
&gt; braking.
&gt;
&gt; NJ transit also has some MCI hybrids which are the big over the road coaches
&gt; (Greyhound type) that have a really large battery pack but operates similar
&gt; to the NYC buses.

Chattanooga has been using hybrids for a number of years. We even have our own
manufacturer:

But they don't run them up the hills around town. They still use diesels for
the heavy lifting.
