Subject: Speedo-cable replacement

I need to put a new speedometer cable into my '71.  How tough is this?
What should I look out for?  I have a '68 parts bus that (I think) still
has its cable.  Would I be better off just buying a new cable, or can a
yank the other one pretty quick?  TIA!
 
Have a good one,
Eric Shook
