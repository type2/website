Subject: Re: [T2] pointless plug gap

Right, I'll definitely read the plugs during my spring tuneup.  Right 
now they're stock gaps, but I have heard that with pointless ignition, 
I might want to open them up a bit.  True/false?  If I did open them 
up, how much?  I'm not clear on the exact effect this would have, but I 
gather that it might make the spark hotter and therefore result in 
better combustion.  I assume I'd have to play with the timing a bit.  
I've looked in the library and archives, and couldn't find anything on 
the differences in tuning when you go to pointless.  Thanks, all.
   I'm in Northern New Mexico, actually, but I've been through Flagstaff 
a few times, although not lately.
Cheers,
Tor

&gt; I would start with what Bentley manual says then read the plugs. If 
&gt; they are a nice light tan you are ok. I also am at 7000 ft and find
