Try tightening your cylinder head temp sensor, first the connection to the 
harness then to the head.

&gt; heloo,
&gt; took goethe to work today. she is a 75 FI autotran.  she drove fine if
&gt; i did not give her full throttle.  then when i got her out on the
&gt; highway she bucked like mad at 60-70 mph but kept, mostly, up to
&gt; speed.  well, i had no choice but to continue on to the jobsite and
&gt; did so.  whenever i put the petal to the floor she ran boggy and then
&gt; bucked more.  she did the same eight hours later when i drove the
&gt; highway home.  she idles better than she has in a long, long time.
&gt; she has a new fuel pump, fuel filter, afm, rotor, cap,petronix.  the
&gt; dwell, coil, temp sensor 2, etc.  all tested within specs.
