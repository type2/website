Subject: Re: [T2] sub-cultures

Billy,

Down here in Arkansas, *all* the air cooled folks wave.  The &quot;new
Beetle&quot; folks just stare or act like they have seen nothing at all.

Maybe I'll jack up my 68 dbl cab like those bajabus folks and then we can
see how the 4wd folks take it.  

On my 78 maiden voyage last weekend(before the ice and snow here), I had
forgotten that you are actually sitting higher than most of the SUV
folks...feels good to look down on them every once in awhile after driving
a bug&lt;grin&gt;.  Now maybe I can get some r*e*s*p*e*c*t!

Just remember that most buses have a higher clearance than jeeps!

My girlfriend just bought a 67 camper....she was exceptionally thrilled
when someone shot her a peace sign...hahaha


Cheers, dave

&gt; I think it might be the area.  When I drive my Bus around (I'm 30
&gt; minutes -south- of Atlanta) I get strange looks, a couple waves, always waves from other AC VW owners.  When I drove a Bus up in the Chicago area, no one ever gave it a second look.  I also remember seeing more of them up there...
&gt; 
&gt; So what's up with hot 'lanta? I'm in california, self-described vw hotbed, and busdrivers give me the shaft when I wave 8 times outta 10.
&gt; 
&gt; Course, this is self-described yuppie hotbed as well. Also, being in the central valley, I sometimes think there's more rednecks here than the whole south. Don't take kindly to non 4x4 modes of travel.
&gt; 
&gt; Yeehaw,
&gt;
