Subject: Re: [T2] bad buyer

&gt; You have a typical undocumented Bus at a price that is within the real 
&gt; world market. She wants something better. Advise her to look 
&gt; elsewhere. For sure, don't work up an ulcer thinking YOU blew the sale 
&gt; with this ignoramus. 



Point her to the local Toyota dealer. You don't want to sell it to her 
'casue in a week or two she'll be back with complaints about how 
something doesn't work right. Or worse she'll have an accident and sue 
you b/c you did a brake job on it 2 years ago. She prob has very 
unrealistic expectations for your bus (aka turn the key and drive it 
with only 100K maintenance just like her sister's Ford).
