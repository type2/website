Subject: turn signals work now, thanks!

Ken Hooper, Dan Simmons and All,

Well, I finally got off my ass and attacked my turn signal problem
today.

I decided to try the easy advice of cleaning all my connections first,
as I have this irrational fear of volt meters, ohm meters, multi
meters, etc.

The rear ones WERE pretty cruddy, so I cleaned what I could and
replaced ALL of the female connections. Thank God for the extra 32nd
of a millimeter of wire there!!!

Finished up and....Nothing.

Still in meter-phobia mode, I loosened up the steering column bracket
to get a better look at the rats nest. BINGO!!! A second wire had come
loose and I couldn't see it before! Had to refer to ol' Bob Bentley
who said it went to the emergency flasher relay. Popped it on and now
she flashes like an old man in Central Park!!

I don't know why I even cared about my turn signals anyway, as no one
in the god-forsaken town I live in knows what they're for, much less
uses them;-(, but I'm glad to have 'em back.

The bright side (no pun intended) of all the new and cleaned
connections is that all of my lights actually seem brighter than before.
