Subject: Vanagon Body Panels (European Source?)

Called Mill Supply today to find out that they no longer carry
any body panels for the Vanagon, I was looking for rear fenders
which they used to have.  They said their importer quit bringing
them in.  So I query, does anyone else import them and can anyone
&quot;across the pond&quot; get them and if so how hard to import.  I have
not called VW but am sure the price would be scary.
