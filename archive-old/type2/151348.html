Subject: Re: [T2] Kadrons on a 1700-1800 Type 4 motor ?

I slapped Kadrons on my 1700 '73 but I ordered shorter aluminum  
intakes from lowbugget_dot_com over the stockers for warmup in winter. I  
believe its a bug linkage that I have, though I mounted it reversed  
and used a lip in the engine bay for the return spring to pull off so  
I could use the stock throttle cable.

I had mine on for about a year before I pulled the engine for an  
upgrade to 2L and they worked great, just get the jetting right. They  
will be going on my 2L when its back in. I recall John from aircooled  
having a replacement throttle plate tapped for Vac as well though  
mine were tapped when I got them.

sry for the double send oldschool.
