Hi Volks!

&gt; You're not a'kidding there!  The factory crimps are done under huge
&gt; pressure.  If you carefully remove a factory-crimped connector you will
&gt; find the copper wire underneath to be bright and shiny, just as it was
&gt; when new.  I don't believe that you can get this level of protection with
&gt; consumer-grade crimping tools, so soldering is the best way to avoid
&gt; corrosion and loosening problems.  I've seen quite a few failures of
&gt; home-crimped connections due to corrosion and loosening, and I'm a 
&gt; desert dweller.

Well, there's crimping, and then again there's crimping.  All
I've seen fail so far were those POS plastic-insulated DIY
connectors.  Steer clear of those.  I replace them as a matter
of principle.  But the non-insulated connectors, applied with
the correct tool, hold up just as well as factory-installed
ones, IMHO.

Don't know about the U.S., but you can get the connectors
as well as the tool in any decent electronics shop here,
and those were the most worthwhile $20 I ever spent on a
tool.  The connectors are even cheaper than that 
plastic-covered stuff, I recently bought 100 of them for $2.

I've never found the need for soldering since I've been using
these.  But I've too heard that soldered wires tend to break,
so I won't be trying it either.  One idea if you insist
on soldering is to hold the connector with a pair of pliers
or such, as close as possible to the place where you solder, 
to take out the heat of the wire, thus preventing the
tin-solder to creep up into the wire insulation.  Since you
crimp the insulation to the connector as well, there'll be
no stress anymore on the soldered part, which should minimize
the risk of breaking.

Airhowlingly yours,
   Erik.
