There should be a paint code plate behind the front passenger's seat. It
will say something like L31H.
Here is a link somebody else sent a few days ago that works good too.

The link I sent is for the 71 model bus. Hit home to go the the main page.

&gt; Esteemed Listees -
&gt;
&gt; Is there a number on the chassis of my 71 Campmobile that I can decode to
&gt; give me the original paint scheme for my bus? Where would I look and once
I
&gt; find the #, where can I find out what it means?
&gt; A while back, I posted a question about the sizes of the bolts which mount
&gt; the outer ends of the front bumper. No one seemed to have the answer -
&gt; figured it out. For those who need this info, they are 8mm, 1.25 pitch
&gt; self-tapping bolts with fender washers. The size question was driving me
&gt; nuts until I realized the bolt threads were really mucked up with
&gt; rust-n-stuff. A tap soon cleared this up.
&gt; Believe it or not, I then found a guy only a couple of blocks away with a
70
&gt; Westy. In return for fixing his bus (bad battery, high idle, VERY little
oil
&gt; caught just in time), he let me borrow a bolt to match up.
&gt; Bus folk are the best!
&gt;
&gt; TIA,
&gt;
&gt; Tom
&gt;
