Subject: Vendor report (Berg)

 I got this post today from Peter Davy, some of you may remember 
him from the list.(VVW)
 
 He's not too pleased with Berg. 

 I think he has reason, so I thought I'd post this.

 He's had Berg do an entire engine for him and he's still waiting
for his heads. They've been promised several times but keep being
rescheduled by Berg.

 Now this shows up.

 I'm beginning to think all the vendors have the same disease.

Hi 

I'm starting to wonder about Gene Berg Enterprises. They sent me 
these 1.4:1 rocker arms I ordered a while back and I wasn't too 
happy with them. One shaft was bright shiny, newly machined and 
the other was sort of old looking and pitted. So I sent them a 
fax and they said send it back. It cost me $80 NZ to send them 
back un-opened.

Then they send me a fax after they arrived at the other end 
saying that Tim has inspected the rockers and there is nothing 
wrong with them so I can take a running jump and they are sending 
them straight back to me at my cost. This is the other side of 
the world remember. Like I'm some dog or something.

Phew, restraining myself from telling them what to do with the 
other parts that I have ordered but they have not yet sent, I 
send fax reminding them I have spent $7000 NZ at Gene Berg and 
aren't they being a trifle silly. I point out that I have no 
problem with the strength or quality of the rockers but they 
_are_ the most expensive in the world probably and I want them to 
look nice and match. (OK I'm being fussy)

So I get a fax back that is very apologetic and yes there are 
some obvious cosmetic flaws (their words) in one shaft and yes 
they will exchange them for me after all. As if I needed all that 
hassle &lt;sigh&gt;.

I think I have finally discovered the arrogance of Berg 
Enterprises that everybody on the list used to talk about. I 
always argued on the side of GB before but they've got me 
wondering now. This is a _really_ expensive engine (it frightens 
me to even think about what it has cost) and I feel I am entitled 
to want it to at least look like it is a good engine. For a lot 
less money I could have used pretty SCAT rockers. I've always 
maintained the Berg did the best VW parts and been like a 
disciple of the Berg way... So much for them looking after their 
good customers...

regards
Peter Davy (New Zealand)
