Subject: Re: [T2] OEM Fog Lamps?

&gt;I noticed that it had TWO holes evenly spaced in the underside
&gt;of the dash. I ASSUME that these holes were likely used to 
&gt;bolt a set of FOG lamps on. My Bus is a 1973, does anyone 
&gt;know if a set of factory fog lamps were ever an option with 
&gt;the Bus? These holes look professionally cut.

I'm 99.9% sure that there was never a factory option for fog lights on a bus
(at least in 1973).  But you're right, those 2 holes are perfect for the
application.

I put driving lights on mine instead of fog lights and I wanted them mounted
higher so I unbolted my bumper and flipped it over.  The bumper is exactly
the same upside down and right-side up (except for the 2 holes of course).
