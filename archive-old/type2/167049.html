Subject: Re: [T2] single cab fuel tank

Hi Nathan,

If you have to remove the existing tank anyway, I would strongly  
recommend you do so and take it to your local Rad shop.

If the tank is solid, the &quot;Dino poo&quot; can be removed with an  
appropriate treatment of solvents, steam-cleaning and abrasives. Then  
a new lining can be applied to the interior if required, and you're  
good to go. No new parts needed.


Happy Trails,

Greg Potts

Can anyone suggest a Canuck source for a fuel tank for a 68 single
cab? CiP doesn't carry them and I would rather avoid the costs/delays
of shipping across the border such a large item. According to the
Samba, a pre-72 bus tank is the same. Mine is clogged up with dinosaur
poo...
