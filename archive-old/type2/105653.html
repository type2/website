&gt;One of my inner cv boots is leaking grease between the boot and the shaft. 
&gt;It looks like it oozes out and then gets &quot;flung&quot; around the underside. The

&gt;around the shaft. I read in Bently that these later type boots do not use 
&gt;hose clamps like the ones earlier.

I use 3/16&quot; zip-ties (cable ties) on mine--never had 'em leak, nor suffer 
damage from it.
