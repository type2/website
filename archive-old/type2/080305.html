Subject: Re: [VB] General Oil Notes - Was: Synthetic oil vs. Regular


&gt;As a closing thought I truly believe that people waste too much oil in their
&gt;cars.  Any modern car is able to safely use its dino juice oil over 5000
&gt;miles.  To change oil at 3000 miles these days is a complete waste of
&gt;resources!  If you run synthetic in modern cars make it go 10,000-20,000
&gt;miles because it is safe to do so and increases your return on investment
&gt;due to the high purchase price.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;My food for thought of the day,
&gt;Adrian S. Pillow


well, yes and no... 'modern' car? yup. old vw? nope.
the case of a vw is readily eaten by water; one of the main reasons vw
specified its shorter oil change interval was to remove the water puddling
in the case from stop-and-go driving. if you are not doing a lot of
highway driving, or you see 'mayonnaise' in your oil cap, you need to stick
w/ the program.

not to mention the fact that nearly every vw i see on the streets
(including mine :P) runs overrich, thus diluting the oil quicker.

one day i'll get me one O them european aluminum t1 cases, and GET that 10k
oil life :)
