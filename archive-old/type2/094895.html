Subject: Gross Polluters


    They may be simpler, and they may be easier to work
    on, they may not be subjected to smog testing...but
    that doesn't mean they don't contribute to the smog
    problem.  If you have a vehicle that is a polluter -
    take care of it or get rid of it.

I don't know about Missoula, but in California, the Air Force does more
damage to the environment with one F-16, or American Airlines with one 767
than all of us bus-drivers do.  Keep it running as clean as you can, just
because it runs cooler and better.
