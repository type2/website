Subject: aligning doors

ok so here is a good one..my front doors on my 71 bus need to be moved
forward about 1/8 of an inch so they will close sweetly. anyone? how
about the metal wizard where ever you are? i can push on the doors and
get them to close easier but if i could align them properly, i'd be much
happier.
thanks,
Brian and the Kreeper
