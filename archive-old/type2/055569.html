Subject: re: 72 headlight dimmer relay

To Jerry Brown &amp; his dimmer relay problem....I had the same problem and 
found that a leak (look for rust) in the front windshield rubber had 
dripped down and rusted out my dimmer relay. These things are located way 
up in front of your fuse bank.  I had to take out some of the air ducts 
to get at it properly.  I found that none of the local junk yards had any 
buses with relays in them and VW wanted $100 for one :-(.

I took mine apart and found that some wd 40 cleaned it up great but the 
spring operating the relay was shot (so rusted it fell apart)!  As it 
turns out, a ball point pen spring fits just fine (if its a little long, 
just cut it shorter).  Its been operating perfectly for 2 years now.
