Subject: Shifting problems in 73' Bus

I will get straight to the point.  About a month ago I began having some 
problems with my shifting.  It started with a feeling that all the gears were 
on top of each other and progressed to a point where it was very difficult to 
find first gear at all . I recently took the gear lever off and adjusted the 
stop plate, this has greatly improved the location of the gears, as they are 
all now where they are suppose to be. However, now , it seems that the only 
gears I can find are 3rd and 4th and have to wiggle the gear lever to find 1st 
and 2nd.  Also, I can not downshift from 3rd to second without getting some 
major grinding which ultimately prevents me from finding 2nd at all.  I have 
read the archives and noted how important bushings are, so after some checking 
I have noticed that the rear bushing is missing.  There is major play in my 
gear shifter rod and I think that it comes from the lack of having a bushing 
there.  My questions, does this sound like it is just a missing bushing or 
should I be concerned about the tranny or linkage? Am I going to have to remove 
anything to change the bushing my manuals are not clear on this and it will 
take a week before I get the part. I have never worked on my bus myself but 
recently moved to Spain where there are nothing but a bunch of idiots who offer 
no help at all when it comes to my very awesome bus.  Not even VW dealers will 
work on it. I appreciate any help on this.
