Subject: SVDA

Hi,

I just learned about the SVDA distributor on the type2 list.

The main trouble I am having is that I was given a 74 bus with a 914 motor
partially installed with a 205 P distributor that refused to advance, so I
went to my shed and pulled out my box of left over distributors from motor
cores I've been given over the years, and found mostly variants of the 205
distributor: 205 P, 205 C, 205 S, 205 AA. Hmmm... I thought I had a 244 in
there somewhere, but I don't see it. Also a multitude of 009's.

The main trouble I am having is getting one that has the vacuum advance in
the correct location. Half have it on one side of the distributor, and half
on the other, but neither gives me a position where the vacuum advance
doesn't hit the engine tin before correct timing is achieved.

So right now I've got an 009 in it, but I know it doesn't give sufficient
advance, and I've got it about 12 BTDC at idle in order to get 36 BTDC at
2500 RPM.

I'm posting this to the list too in case you'd rather respond there.

Thanks,

John
