Subject: svda dizzy

My buddy has a question I am posting for him:

I have a 71 westy with a new brazilian DP 1600.  I have chosen to run a 34
pict carb, and after months of distributor frustration, I ordered an SVDA
distributor from aircooled_dot_net.  Now I have to figure out how to set it up.
John says i should set the timing to 32 degrees max advance with the vacuum
line off.  He goes on to say that the timing will be about 45 degrees max
advance once the vacuum line is hooked back up.  This seems too hot to me.
Does anyone have experience with this unit?  I really don't want to burn up
the engine.   Any help would be greatly appreciated.

thanks,

james garrison c/o
