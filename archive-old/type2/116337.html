Subject: Zbed from Zproducts availability

Anyone out there know if Zproducts in Oregon has the Zbed kit (for =
non-Westy buses) available again? Their web site (zproducts_dot_com) shows =
them but last I checked they had stopped producing them saying &quot;lack of =
demand&quot;. My email wasn't answered yet from them.
