Subject: Interstate 80 from SLC to Reno

Going to be cruising through here in July and just wondering what the scenery,
little towns etc are like along the way? I plan on leaving early from SLC one
morning so looking for a stop along the way, say in Winnemucca. We are
travelling in our new Mazda M3 so looking for a good little hotel or motel
that is peaceful and quiet somewhere along the way to Reno. Anyone travelled
this way lately with some good recommendations re: place to stay, restaurants,
things to see? This is our summer holiday.
Thanks,
Courtney
