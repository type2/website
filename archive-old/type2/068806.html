&gt; with
&gt;only one exception, John Anderson, who said his '78 must have the
&gt;alternator charging. 

Sean,
Not to beat a dead battery into the ground, but...

Bently backs this up for vans manufactured from August 1976 to August 1978 (1977
&amp; 1978 models). See section 4, chapter 14, diagram J. The heater air blower is
on current path 70. Directly above the fan is relay J14. The red lever on the
dash (switch E16) provides the ground for the relay. The hot wire goes to the D+
terminal on C1 (the voltage regulator), not the ignition switch. On vans
manufactured before August 1978, the fan does not run unless terminal D= on the
regulator is charged.
Beginning with vehicles manufactured from August 1978 the hot wire to the relay
IS wired to terminal 15 of the ignition switch, providing power to the relay any
time the key is on (and the battery is charged).

It is quite possible that some particular vans were wired differently from the
factory than Bently shows, especially vans that were manufactured around the
time the change took place. Not uncommon practice with VW. When they decided to
make a change, they did it. They weren't gonna wait on the marketing guys to
come up with a new pitch touting &quot;new and improved wiring!&quot;

Thanks for moderating this thread, Sean.    ;-)
