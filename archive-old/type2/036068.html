It is tricky but it can be done without removing the exhaust.  After
disconnecting the plug at the regulator, ush the wire harness down through
the top of the tin several inches.  This will give you enough slack to pull
the alternator out and remove the rear cover, which you need to do to
unplug the other end of the harness.  The back cover comes off via three
small machine screws.

You also have to remove the rubber cooling duct from the rear cover of the
alternator.  You should be able to access the phillips-head screw on the
clamp from underneath the engine.  Use a long flat-blade screwdriver to
push the boot off, being careful not to gouge the rubber.

Once you have done these things, and removed the rear three tin pieces, you
should be able to get the alternator out.  You will have to turn and twist
it all kinds of wierd ways.  Be persistent and eventually you will get it.

Also, if you have a rebuilt alternator, be careful!  I bought one that was
remanufactured by a place I hadn't heard of for $80, and it lasted about
three weeks before failing.  It had a lifetime warranty, but of course they
don't pay for the labor to R&amp;R the alternator!  I returned it, paid the
$130 for the Bosch rebuilt (which has a 1-year warranty that I will never
need, I'm sure) instead and it is still running great.  Also, the non-Bosch
alternator had a washer on one of the posts in back, which grounded out
very nicely when I attached the rear cover to it.  You should have a
rectangular piece of fiber insulation and NOT a metal washer!  Check for it
or you will get to remove your alternator again to fix the problem.  I
still can't believe that there is so little clearance between the rear
cover and the positive terminal.  Seems dangerous (and unnecessary) to me.
