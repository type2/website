Just wondering:
Has anyone else experienced problems with RMMW's cv boots for later buses?
Replacing those buggers is about the nastiest job one can do on one's bus,
and two that I've installed in the last year are already cracked to the
point of splitting. Not just in one spot, either -- we're talking cracks
all over the place on each. I have yet to investigate the company's
lifetime guarantee claim, but will after returning from a week-long camping
trip to Bryce/Zion natl. parks. Which reminds me -- better pack a couple
(non-RMMW) boots along for the ride, just in case. No time to swap 'em out
before we leave.
