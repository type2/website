Subject: Re: [T2] engine number confusion

Hi Everyone,

        I agree concerning GE numbers. I have a '78 with original GE
motor, not a california, bought new in Virginia. Hydraulic lifters were
supose to have come out in 78 but I have seen a late '76 GD engine with
hydraulic lifters supposedly original? I don't know.
