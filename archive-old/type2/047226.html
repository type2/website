&gt;  I want to be able to use the bus stereo (not there yet) and interior
&gt;  lights while camping without running down the starting battery.
&gt;  Creating a second electrical system off the aux battery, which wouldn't
&gt;  allow the use of anything wired into it while underway, doesn't fit with
&gt;  what I wanted.

If you take a supply from the auxilliary battery to your radio, interior 
lights, water pump, TV, CB, ebersracher, accessory socket etc etc then it 
will work just as well with the engine off as with it running. 

This means that if you have an interior light or radio already connected to 
the main battery it will need its supply rerouted to the auxiliary battery.

Don't connect anything to both battries (except the relay) as if the starting 
battery is low but the auxilliary battery high this will become a route for 
the very high starting current - at best you will blow fuses at worst you 
will burn your van to the ground.

The only thing you dont want to permanently connect to the either battery is 
a 12 volt fridge / cooler box - these draw a high current so you want them to 
ONLY work when the ignition is on. So you either use a double relay or two 
single relays to get an engine on supply to the fridge which is isolated from 
both batteries with the engine off.

Good luck
