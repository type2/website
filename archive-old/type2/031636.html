&gt; I was wondering something and I wanted to get the opinion of the list before
&gt; Here goes.
&gt; I am under the impression that there is a better material which could be
&gt; used to pull heat off the engines than the tin provided. Obviously if you

tin does not disapate the heat, it is the ducting for the airflow, the air
flows over the heatsinks (fins on the cyl and heads) 

&gt; are recieving this message then you have a computer, well electronic
&gt; components create huge amounts of heat which needs to be disipated into the
&gt; surrounding environment in order for the component to continue operation, to
&gt; do this they use heat-sinks(of different materials depending on the required
&gt; heat dissipation). So what I was wondering is if you where to somehow make
&gt; either new tins from one of these materials or in some way mount it to where
&gt; it was either in contact with or veary near to it then it should
&gt; dramatically decrease the engine temp.

sounds like they stole the concept from the VW engine, tear into your
engine sometime and you will see how it works

&gt; until way after the initial design and release of the engine types we all
&gt; love so much I don't really think the materials where readily available

actually the type 4 is this improvement, it is alum rather than magnesium,
the fan is the ducted type rather than a squirrel cage...etc

the next &quot;improvement&quot; they made was to add water
