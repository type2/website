&gt;After I get my two girls down to bed I plan to try and get the '66s
engine going after twenty-two years of sitting.  I plan to change the
oil, new spark plugs and wires, and a full tune up.  Am I missing
anything?  Does anyone have any tips for this glorious event?  Thanks


Jamie, one item I've just added to old-engine-start list :

Make sure the oil pressure relief valve (and the control valve on later
engines) is freed up to operate. Prolly cost me an oil cooler on recent KG 
start up. Fortunately the 8MM coolers are available all over the place.

Good luck on your &quot;new&quot; toy..Marv Krupp
