Subject: Idead for Bus rally start date
Message-ID: &lt;378EE4AD.A3767EA2_at_mindspring_dot_com&gt;

I would love to start this on Aug. 9, for some this is a special date. 
For myself I could think of nothing better to do on this sad day than to
spend it driving my bus to someplace new with no other purpose than to
meet a fellow bus/list/friend.  Just a thought,
Scott
