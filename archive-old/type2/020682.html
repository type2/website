&gt;
&gt; &gt;The real list admins deserve a lot more consideration than me, certainly,
&gt; &gt;and have for a long time. So do the people who continually improve the
&gt; &gt;content on the web site.
&gt; &gt;
&gt;
&gt;       If we've managed it for the last 7-8 years, it can continue, no?
&gt; Sometimes the admin staff has to come down with an iron fist. I can dig
&gt; that. While policies such as banning folks that send unsubscribe messages
&gt; seem harsh, the reality is that it keeps the signal to noise ratio high.
&gt; And in these days of hotmail and other free accounts, it's not even a
&gt; terribly severe punishment. Most importantly, it is what has kept the
&gt; list alive for all this time. In time, it seems that most everybody comes
&gt; to this conclusion. I don't expect that to change...
&gt;

Edmund:
I'd second that!
This list sure has some magic. It seems a lot smoother and better organized and
more HELPFUL than others I've subscribed to or audited. And there are some
wonderful people on it too!
I'm currently suffering from _at_home mail syndrome (in which the mail server sends
some of my mail instantly and some 3 weeks later), so some of this makes no sense
to me. But mostly I'll defer to the decisions of the loose knit plutocracy that
has done pretty good so far!
