Subject: '73 bus FS Austin TX $500

Hi y'all,
     Buddy of mine is parting w/his '73. Here's the deal. 

     It's beige/white trim. Homemade modification of transporter to a 
sort of &quot;overnighter&quot;. Has the fold-down bed, old style, but the cabinet 
that blocks the right rear window is chopped so visibility is not 
hampered. Has the louvered camper windows, and electric hookups. No 
poptop. Like I say, this is not a factory job, but if you don't know any 
better you probably won't notice-it's real well done. Exterior is 
reportedly in good condition.

     Problem is low compression on the engine. It's reportedly drivable, 
but not terribly far, and performance deteriorates as engine temp 
increases. This is the 1700cc engine. I haven't seen the bus personally 
for a year or two, but the last time I saw it, it was well worth the 
asking price, and I trust the fellow who has it has kept up on it pretty 
well. I'm guessing this bus is a bargain for the asking price, esp. if 
you've already got a T4 engine needing a home. Asking price is $500 as is.

     Fellow to contact is John Stinson, jstinson_at_eden_dot_com-reply to him, 
not me.


Peace,
