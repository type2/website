&gt;I have a 71 bus whose gas mileage has been drastically &gt;reduced over the last three years.

Check your oil. Is there a gas smell? If there is, you probably have cracked intake manifold boots. It's easiest to replace them with the engine out, I think. Others disagree. This can lead to serious engine damage, so don't let it go uncorrected!

Check your valves. Has one or more been getting tighter and tighter? If it has, you have heads at the end of their wear cycle and valves that are a risk to your engine.

Check the compression on each cylinder. If compression is low or uneven, you have pistons and cylinders at the end of their wear cycle.

By all means, use your investigative tools and powers to discover why you're getting worse gas mileage; this is an indicator that something is not correct and you are wise to monitor fuel economy on ANY car. You now have a chance to catch your problem before it leads to catastrophe.

Thanks! Joe
