Subject: Am I &quot;Screw&quot;ed?

Looking for suggestions - before I do something drastic!

The screws that hold the tin onto my left cylinder head have apparently
become one with the head - I can't get them to budge.

I soaked it with WD-40 before trying anything too outrageous.

I've already broken one brand new Craftsman screwdriver (thank goodness
for that lifetime warranty!).

I borrowed a propane torch from a coworker and heated it up as much as I
felt comfortable doing - the tin was glowing, so I assume I got it
plenty hot, and it still wouldn't budge.

I'm getting to the point of wanting to just take tin snips, cut the tin
away so I can pull the head, and just ordering new heads and tin - hey,
I want dual port anyway, right?

Any other suggestions for removing a stuck screw? Or am I right in
assuming that the screw and the head are now inseparably connected?

Thanks!
