Subject: Saggy front suspension

Hi all,
Andy is getting a little saggy in the front end.
I replaced the front torsion &quot;leaves&quot; from a spare parts bus the sat nice
and high, but it wasn't long before Andy was sagging again.
So what options are out there to fix this, and what's the best way?
As far as I can tell I have the following options:
1) Find another used set and try my luck (don't like this one!).
2) Source a new set of springs (are they still available, and are there
&quot;heavy duty sets?).
3) Keep the springs I have and make the front end adjustable (It would be
nice to have the front end adjustable, but I don't like the idea of cutting
the front beam to make the mod).
4) Fit coil over shocks. (easiest option, but I haven't found a good set
yet).

Thanks for your help.

Richard,
