&gt; &gt;Hi all,
&gt; &gt;So any ideas will be appreciated.
&gt;
&gt; Take it to a shop with air and have them zip it off and install it on the
&gt; new alternator. Job done right, don't have to buy a compressor and air gun.
&gt; Do you have a Les Swab tire store in the hood?
&gt;
&gt; &gt;The new Bosch starter is made in Mexico and from what I
&gt; &gt;can tell so far, that's not a problem.  We shall see how it lasts.
&gt;
&gt; The Mexicans are about 15 years behind Taiwan as far as industrial
&gt; capabilities (subjective opinion). They are starting with the best designs
&gt; in the world when making VW/Bosch parts, but their quality control is not
&gt; yet reliable. It took Japan 30 years to start putting out high quality
&gt; products after WWII. Mexico will get better as time goes by, or else they
&gt; will remain a 3rd world country.

OTOH, Mexico has been building the aircooled VW for decades, while no
aircooled VW has been made in Der Fatherland for 20 years.  The
millions of VW bugs and busses running around Mexico consist of mostly
Mexican parts and they seem to do fine.  &quot;German quality&quot; isn't all that
it used to be either.

The big difference seems to be between factory and aftermarket parts.
Anyone who has installed an aftermarket mexican muffler knows what I mean
here!  The mufflers made by VW de Mexico are a different story, but not
many of them find their way to the US since the price is undercut by the
Mexican aftermarket manufacturers.  Cheap pushes out good unless you are
very careful who you buy from.

George
