Subject: grey dust on rotor
Message-ID: &lt;3774361C.D90B001A_at_jps_dot_net&gt;

Hey,
        I pulled the distributor cap on my '78 Westy today and found a
strange residue of gray dust on the metallic parts and sides of the
rotor and the center terminal of the cap. I've only run it for about
10-15 minutes to break the engine in. The cap and rotor are almost new.
Is this normal? I don't remember seeing this before.
