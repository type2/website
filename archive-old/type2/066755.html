Subject: Re: 65' bus door key question

&gt;I don't have his card, but a fellow at Mannassas Bug-Out (virginia) has a
&gt;booth where he cuts keys for you on a VW cutter which nibbles the key based
&gt;on that code on your lock tumbler.  He  said he'll make a key if you send
&gt;him a tumbler (easiest is from rear cargo door); don't just send the #;
&gt;it's a security/antitheft thing.   If # isn't visible, he'll put a &quot;feeler
&gt;key in and determine the right code for the tumbler!    Anyone know this
&gt;person's addie???

I haven't been to Mannassas, but at the Litchfield and Terryville, CT shows
Mark's VW brings along a key cutting machine.  They are in Center Village or
Plainfield, CT.  # is (860) 564-4568.
