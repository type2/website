Subject: Re: [T2] Oil pressure sender, 914 oil temp sender plate and vacuumport

On a Vanagon 2 liter, the dipstick mounts different than on the earlier bay
windows, thus it does not need to be shortened.  I run a temp sensor with
the stock dipstick, and no issues.

The rubber boot is available from the dealer, RMMW, Bus depot to name a few.
I did not cut my tin but instead used a pipe nipple with a tee on the end to
mount my dual pressure sensor.  No issues here.

I too have not ever found a good oil filler gasket.  You can be assured that
the motor you find that elusive gasket on has never been rebuilt..........

Also, there is a rubber washer that goes on the thermostat cable between the
two pieces of tin...............seals that tiny hole!!!

&gt; Al,
&gt;
&gt; I think you are correct... the cooling air loss *is* considerable from the
&gt; oil pressure sender, but the fact remains, I have never seen a proper boot
&gt; installed.  The part is certainly available.  I am certain it can be
&gt; obtained from any of the vendors on the list (I got mine thru Bus Depot),
&gt; or any VW parts place.  I have seen one, heck, I have one that I ordered
&gt; for the '80 before I got into &quot;tin carving&quot; but it would take considerable
&gt; modification to get it over the size pipe I was sold as an extension to
&gt; raise the sender above the distributor.
&gt;
&gt; Now if you want a *hard* cooling air gasket to find (at least in any
&gt; decent sort of shape...  Did you know that there is supposed to be a &quot;D&quot;
&gt; shaped gasket where the oil fill tube passes thru the tin on a Vanagon?
&gt; It is very &quot;NLA&quot; AFAIK and the examples I have seen in junkyards (one of
&gt; which is installed on my vanagon) are not exactly confidence-inspiring.
&gt; For whatever reason, VW did not use an oil-resistant compount on this
&gt; gasket that gets oil poured all over it by times :-( Between the heat and
&gt; the oil soakage, every example I have seen looks like a licorice
&gt; gummi-gasket.
