Subject: Question:  Case Adapter Question

I currently have a 71 bus with a Type 1 case that has an adapter mounted
on the oil pump to allow it to mount to the rear hanger for my 71 Type
2.  I purchased the bus this way and I am having no problems with this
setup at the moment.  My question is if I should leave this setup alone
or if I should drill and tap the case to accept the rear hanger for the
71 Type 2.  Does anybody have any long-term experience with this
adapter?
