Subject: Kids EGGED my bus... what should I do???

It's been on there for about a week to a week and a half before I noticed
it. I've heard that this toasts a paint job...True??? It' looks discolored
but I haven't washed it yet for fear of doing something wrong. If anyone has
experience, does insurance cover this if the paint is toast?

79 Bus MSHP Stage 1, FI, AT - Weekender.
