Subject: Did Nikki Get Her Bus Running?

Nikki stayed the night with me and my wife last wedns in lubbock,TX on her 
way to phoenix and I hadn't checked my email til today and saw all the 
trouble she had. I feel bad now cause I almost gave her my 009 w/ compufire 
cause I had recently put in a mallory. We got off the subject of dist. and I 
had just plain forgot about it. :(  Does anyone know if she is up and going 
again?  Does she still need a dist?  I can ship her mine if she is still in 
need.  Let me know if you know anything. Thanks
