Subject: Re: Brake Booster

&gt;My &quot;76 did the same thing when I bought it ( Single Weber, brake booster
&gt;disconnected). First thing I found was that the check valve in the vacuum line
&gt;was missing. Got it from West Coast Metric for about 15 bucks. Second, I found
&gt;the carb itself was shot, and a new Weber carb made a big improvement. In
&gt;fact, now when I step on the brakes, engine RPM's actually increase slighty.
&gt;Can anyone explain that?         Jeff

A vacuum leak will increase engine RPM.  That's essentially what happens
when you step on the brakes - well actually it happens when you LIFT the
brake pedal after stepping on it.
