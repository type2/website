Subject: RE: insurmountable VW frustration

For the record (see archives), I went through 3 sets of new, &quot;top of the 
line&quot;, &quot;Genuine BOSCH&quot; plug wires earlier this year before finding a set that 
worked.  

There was no continuity at all in some of the wires, and others had such 
crummy terminal clips that the breeze from the cooling fan blew them right off 
the plugs.

The set I'm now running, the 4th since last Spring, function acceptably from 
an electrical standpoint.  However, the seals for the access holes in the tin 
curled up like wilted flowers within an hour of installation.  I was able to 
put together a set of seals from some old (10+ years) BOSCH wires I had in my 
junk box, and these have held their shape and worked fine ever since.

This and other similar &quot;Genuine BOSCH&quot; experiences over the past year has left 
me very skeptical about the quality of recently manufactured BOSCH components. 
 I'm lucky to have a FLAPS that is aware of this deterioration in quality, and 
is willing to replace or refund on electrical parts even though such parts are 
usually not returnable.

YMMV, but buyer beware.....
