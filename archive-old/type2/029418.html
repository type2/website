I don't believe this to be true.  If a part is truly unobtainable the
referee station should issue an exemption for it.  Exactly how they
determine that it is unobtainable is the $64000 question.

Personally, I think it would be less hassle to fabricate a legal
replacement part from junkyard parts, though.  Considering how fragile the
late bay filler necks can be, there must be a better way.

&gt; I don't know what the state of CA expects. Maybe they expect that you will
&gt; sell your old car and support their well-heeled auto industry constituents by
&gt; buying an exorbitantly priced new car.

Well, that is their goal.  Nothing to do with smog, of course, since those
new cars are exempt from inspection for _4_ years.  This is for the
convenience of the legislators who wouldn't be caught dead in a car more
than four years old.  Smog inspections are for the little people.

&gt; What is required is someone with the legally required restrictor who trusts
&gt; you enough to loan you theirs to pass the inspection.

Not a bad idea, but what a hassle!

&gt; a smog station in San Diego that has a whole stock, smog-able 1600 engine 
&gt; sitting in the corner. They install it in VWs just long enough to pass 
&gt; smog, then remove it and put in whatever street illegal suped up thing 
&gt; their muscle engine fancy dictates. 

I've heard of various marque-clubs (Mustang, Corvette, etc) having a &quot;club
engine&quot; for this purpose, but I've never heard of a smog station having
one.  What service!
