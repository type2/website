Subject: [T2] Balance Tube elbows

I just reattached my balance tubes using new elbows, my old ones had
arthritis.
Anyway the clearance between the elbows and the air injection tubing is
tight.
The air system is disabled with check valve still in place and inlet
plugged. do I have to worry about the new elbows getting fryed?
