Subject: Re: [VB] Vacuum Can Question

&gt; I have a vacuum can that came off a 71 bus distributor. According to
www.oldvolkshome_dot_com the can should be a 07 092.  How do I know if this is the
right vacuum can or not?  Are other vacuum cans interchangeable for a 71 bus
DP1600?
&gt; The only number on the can is 853 stamped on the vacuum arm.

853 is the last 3 digits of the long Bosch number. 1 237 121 853  This
converts to the short part number: 07 092
This vacuum unit fits 71 bus and 72-73 bugs w/auto trans only.
The specs on this vacuum unit are:
Advance/Retard Range: Vacuum: 2-5deg Adv, 11-13deg Ret
[the Bosch book shows 71 auto bugs using a 07 083 vac unit, 811 on the arm,
but I have no specs for this one]

The 2-5 advance degrees are what makes this one hard to find. If you can find
a 74 Calif auto stick bug, it has the same 2-5 deg advance. But I do not know
why it has a different number on it. 07 118 [971 on the arm]
