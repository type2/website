Subject: Broken valve stem? (maybe not!)
Message-Id: &lt;199905151616.JAA28014_at_helix.ucsd_dot_edu&gt;

Thanks to suggestions from H. Steven, Gentery McCormick, and William 
Keating, I took off the rockers to see what was up. Here's the diagnosis:

- Valve seems to be intact. It is tight in the guide, but I can move it in 
and out with vise grips (lightly tensioned). It stops right where it 
should, so I no longer think the stem is broken.

- Keepers were out

- Spring seat mangled by wear from rocker

- One of the keepers an inch down in the pushrod tube

- Both pushrods have a 3/8&quot; ring of wear one inch from the rocker end

So how could this happen? I adjusted the valves before starting the first 
time, and again after 25 miles or so. The keepers must have been on then. 
I didn't find the other keeper (though it may be down in the case). Is it 
remotely possible that the keeper disintegrated in place.

Too weird, but otherwise it's really good news (I think)!
