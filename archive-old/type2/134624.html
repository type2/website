Subject: Re: [T2] Alternator Questions

From: &quot;john kolak&quot; &lt;jkolak_at_gmail_dot_com&gt;
&gt; At this point I feel very confident that your loose wire is the one
&gt; that was supposed to be connected to the starter. At this point you
&gt; could temporarily hook it to the battery so you can test the voltage.
&gt; Once you verify everything is in order, you can move it to the starter
&gt; where it belongs. You may want to run a remote starter wire from the
&gt; starter solenoid to the battery so you can start the bus from the
&gt; engine compartment and thus minimize the running time while you check
&gt; for abnormal voltage.

I hooked it up to the battery and viola!  It works.  No more glowing
alternator light at night and there's 14.1 volts at the positive post on the
battery.

Thank you to everyone who helped out.

I'm not sure if I want to go through the trouble of running it through the
grommet and to the starter, but I might replace the end of the wire and do
it anyway.

It was so good to drive to the store and back without watching the alt light
get brighter and brighter.  And my low/high beams work properly now.  I
didn't need a tailgater to light the road in front of me. :O)
