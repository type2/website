Subject: Advice needed, towing my bus

Hey all,

Like the subject line says, I need some advice about towing my bus.  It's
a '75 Westy, I need to tow it about XXX miles .. and the engine isn't in
it right now.  I'm thinking I could do things like I did last time (when
the engine *was* in it) and use a tow dolly from one of the rental outfits.

But I'm not sure.  I've got the blown engine handy and could put it back
in for the trip if I need to.  There's noplace to turn around with a
flatbed trailer, otherwise I'd just do that .. I'm on a one-lane dirt
road right now.

Thanks in advance.
