    A nice, rich brown color on the insulator of your spark plugs, for
one. Or a exhaust meter reading, but the spark plug reading is pretty
good especially if you take it after a 15 minute highspeed freeway
cruise, then just shut off the engine and roll to a stop, no idling,
etc.


&gt; I've set my mixture screw per Bentley, i.e. turned all the way in, then
&gt; out 2.5-3 turns, and then out more based on idle speed.  Is there anything
&gt; else?  Or any way to know (backfiring, etc) that the mixture is correct?
&gt;
    That's just the idle mixture. The main jets and airjets control the
real mixture.
