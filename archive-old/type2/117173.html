yes, it is a common practice when you don't have the proper tools and keeps
the lines from collapsing but you need to ensure all the sand is out
afterwards.  works great on fuel line or even plumbing when necessary.

bend brake lines by hand, you should fill them with sand first so they
don't
kink. i wondered (to myself) if they were serious.
