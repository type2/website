I have the tranny jack and it is great, has a jack, tilt and dolly all

&gt; my plan is that mine's set up to allow you go slide a hydraulic lift between
&gt; the casters to receive the engine once it's unbolted, then you lower it down
&gt; onto the dolly.  The lift then slides out and the engine moves around more
&gt; conveniently on the dolly.
