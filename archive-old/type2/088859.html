Subject: Re: [T2] LOUD FUEL PUMP?


&gt; Does $220.00 sound like not much bread. I've seen them for $165.00 made
&gt; in Brazil.
&gt;
Oh! It DOES sound like a too much bread! Gosh darn it, I just KNEW there was
a reason I didn't want a Vanagon. I'm taking the camper top and innards off
of a '79 and putting it on/in a '71. I like this idea better all the time.
