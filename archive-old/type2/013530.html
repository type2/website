I've done a fair bit of searching on the web, etc., for a good 
(efficient/inexpensive)
way of keeping food cool and I thought I'd report what I'd found.  This
is more for the archives than anything else.

It looks like the best bang for your buck would probably be
Tundra's Cuisair Portable Refrigerator/Freezer.  It isn't
cheap (~$700), but it's a heck of a lot cheaper than some that
I have seen (FridgieFreeze is ~$1400).

Note: I haven't used one of these, so I don't know from first hand
experience, but here's what I based my decision on:

  -- uses a DANFOSS compressor
	These compressors are known as being the most efficient compressors
	out there and run straight DC (as opposed to being a 3-in-1 or AC 
with a DC
	adaptor).  This means you don't have transformer losses, etc.  I have a
	friend who is really into Alt. Energy (does installations, etc.) 
and he's running
	a fridge which uses a DANFOSS compressor in his Behemoth that's 
fitted for complete
	off-grid living and recommends it hands down.

-- top-loading:  means the cold doesn't &quot;drop out&quot; every time you open 
the door

-- fairly low amp-hr pull, but given it's form-factor, I would probably 
insulate it further
	by creating an insulated box which is bolted into the floor I'm 
building.  This
	should help reduce the power-pull.

Again, this is more for someone who can't be bothered with buying ice 
and wants
something that, coupled with a big 'ole deep-cycle and a solar-panel or 
4 can live
w/out hookups for a while.  It's pretty expensive for someone who's just 
taking
weekend trips, will have hookups, or otherwise...

FWIW, at the grand canyon 3 weeks ago, I found a normal ice chest with a 
wet towel
draped over it (enough to cover the seams of the lid) used pretty much 
none of the
ice I had in there (and the towel was cool to the touch after 13 
hours).  Evaporation
is your friend...

&gt;    Hey There.
&gt; Just wondering if one of these coolers will keep beer cold if I put the 
&gt; beer
&gt; in cold?:0
&gt; Seriously:) I got one last Xmas from my Dad and just bought the power 
&gt; supply
&gt; for 120VAC. I plugged it in the other day in the garage in 30 Deg C 
&gt; shade
&gt; and was suprised at how cool it felt when I stuck my hand (and head:) 
&gt; in ! I
&gt; plan on running it throu the cig liter plug while driving and running 
&gt; it off
&gt; ground power at night while camping. This will be off the main starting
&gt; battery. Anyone have any comments on how this'll work or similar 
&gt; experience
&gt; with Koolatron coolers.
