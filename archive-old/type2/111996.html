&gt; is the one way valve on backwards.  you should be able to suck on the

If the 1-way valve was on backwards, the engine would definitely not have
a problem with vacuum leaks!  The booster would also not see any vacuum,
causing the power brakes not to work.

Since the problem is only when the brakes are applied, it certainly sounds
like a vacuum leak in the booster.
