Subject: GREASE GUZZLER: Two Massachusetts men journey west in VW van that runs 
 on fat and cooking oil

Perhaps it's not surprising that a VW van piloted by
two young men would reek of maple bars,
hamburgers, fried chicken and bacon after a cross-
country tour -- road food, after all, is a big part of
the road trip experience.

But Justin Carven and his lifelong friend, Skip
Wrightson, aren't the only ones scarfing the junk
food on a trip from New England to California and
back. Their Volkswagen van is addicted as well.

Carven, 23, and Wrightson, 22, left their native
state of Massachusetts on July 13, determine to
drive across the nation and back on funky old
cooking oil and fat.

Instead of filling up at Shell stations along the
interstate, they prowled towns and cities for mom-
and-pop restaurants, fueling their rig with the dregs
of deep fat fryers.

They blew into San Francisco a couple of days ago,
and plan to spend today in Oakland before lighting
out for Los Angeles.

The 1982 blue VW Westfalia camper the two men
are driving is powered by a unique diesel engine
Carven designed and built, one that runs on virtually
any kind of oleaginous material poured into its tank.

The van has been getting about 25 to 27 miles per
gallon of grease, said Wrightson.
