Subject: Battery Light Doesn't go off

Ok, here's another one I forgot to ask.

On the '78 the battery light doesn't go off - even with the key out of the
ignition. I know there are some electrical issues because the PO had an alrm
system on the bus that was causing battery drain - I've been told that was
removed - however something is still draining the battery when not in use -
I'll tackle that later. Right now I was just curious about that battery
light - is it staying on because of the issues I mentioned or could it be
unrelated tot hat.

I hope that made sense. Thanks again ahead of time :)
