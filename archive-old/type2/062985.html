Subject: Wanted: bottom engine tin

I really need the piece of engine cooling tin that bridges the right side of
the case to the right heat exchanger on my '77 westy.  You know the piece on 
the bottom that covers the bottom of the engine and push rod tubes and
thermostat.  It may even be in two pieces to allow axcess to the thermostat.
I any case I need it and none of my local junkyard busses have it so if
any of you do, please contact me.  I believe the piece may be the same
for any of the FI busses ('75-'79) but I am not 100% sure.
Please help,
brett
