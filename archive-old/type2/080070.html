Subject: Re:Baywindow fresh air vent sealing

The insulation foam on the inside of the vent flapper door has
deteriorated ...What sort of material are you folks replacing this with?

You need about 1/4&quot; thick urethane foam. I bought a pair of cheap 3-4&quot;
wide foam paint brushes. Disassembling one of these gives you a piece of
foam big enough to glue on the vent flapper, which is easy to remove from
the air channel. Then trim around the edge to make a good fit, but leave a
little extra around the edges to make the seal. Don't overtrim as I did
the first time: you'll just have to do it over.

This foam may be available on its own somewhere, but these foam
paintbrushes are ubiquitous at hardware stores and are quite cheap.

Good luck,
