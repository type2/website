Subject: Vanagon Clutch cylinder problems brewing

Hi Volks,

I heard from my Dad last night, he is currently down in Galveston on 
vacation with Mom in their 80 Vanagon westy. He dropped in on the 
Dead-of-Winter campout in Georgia on his way down but elected not to 
stay overnight as we get plenty of that 14 degree Fahrenheit weather up 
here in Ontario. In Galveston the weather is much more to their liking.

He tells me that the clutch is starting to intermittently refuse to 
engage. Not all the time, just once in a while; it may have happened 
only 2-3 times so far. But when you're 2000 miles from home these 
little issues can loom somewhat larger....

Until this week there has been no problems with the clutch. The disk 
and pressure plate were replaced early last summer. If anyone can 
advise us how long we can reasonably expect the clutchcylinder to 
continue functioning before it fails outright it would be appreciated.  
And if there's a mechanic you can recommend in that area (or one to 
stay away from) we'd be happy to get that info as well. Dad is pretty 
proficient mechanically, but I don't know how much of his tool kit is 
traveling with him.

THANKS!!
