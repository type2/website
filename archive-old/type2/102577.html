Subject: Re: [T2] westy roof rack.

&gt; Question......Do all westys have a built in roof rack on the rear fiberglass
&gt; top?  Thanks

Only 68 to 73 large top Westies. They hinged in the front.
74 and up hinged in the rear.
Early bay Westies also had a small straight-up pop top, but I have only seen these billed as Euro models. They
resemble 67 and back pop tops but are slightly different. I have seen a few in the US.
