Subject: RE: Question replacing injector seals....


Troy,

I never took them off before as I considered them &quot;permanent&quot;...
So, I don't know what they look like under there...whether you could use a 
hose clamp and short new line or not.

I bought rebuilt injectors for my 78 for $38 each...they want the cores, 
but won't care if the short pieces are on ther or not as they get replaced 
during rebuild.

I have been very pleased with my rebuilts...I can do 80mph with no 
problem.....

Maybe someone else has actually taken the short ones off and replaced them 
before....an will chime in...

Cheers, dave

&gt; AAhhhhh!!!  Well, to late I suppose.  I got the bastards off and
&gt; replaced them with the fuel line that Mr. Dolan had given me.  ((Hey
&gt; Steve...that line was real tight fit, you were right. Lol )) At this
&gt; point what should I do.  If I were to order new injectors, would that
&gt; piece of fuel line come on it already.  I am sort of confused because
&gt; that line was very worn out and needed to be replaced.  I would think
&gt; that if it was something that was not to be replaced, that they would
&gt; make that of something other than rubber.  Something more durable.  At
&gt; this point should I order new injectors?  Bill was kind enough to give
&gt; me a partial set of injector seals to replace at least one side.  I have
&gt; already done one side now and would like to know if new injectors should
&gt; be purchased first before going through the hassle of getting down in
&gt; there and doing the other side.  Thanks again everyone.

&gt; Troy,
&gt; 
&gt; I didn't see an answer for you on this one yet, so will reply....NO..the
&gt; 
&gt; short ones on the injector are there to stay...do *not* remove.
