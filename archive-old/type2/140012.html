Subject: Piston Slap ?

Well just when everything seems that its going so well this winter ....

I have been noticing that with the colder temperatures I am getting 
what I believe to be piston slap from cyl 1 when its cold out and the 
bus is frigid. Once she warms up its gone but for the first couple 
minutes (maybe minute and a half)  I can hear it quite clearly. Once 
she has been warmed I can stop and start her with no obvious noise.

Any tips to help me make it through the winter ? Squirt of oil in the 
cylinder ? A Boston Bob 2.0 will be going in come spring but I've gotta 
make it 'til then ! (I am NOT dropping and installing a block on the 
street in the snow, I draw the line there &lt;grin&gt;)

This is on my '73, 1700 running 10w30 cause its friggin cold up here in 
the great white north.
