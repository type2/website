&gt; No, shot peening is a process typically done to connecting rods to
&gt; strengthen them.
&gt; 
&gt; What they do to the heads is sort of &quot;pinch&quot; the metal around the edge of
&gt; the seat to increase the interference.  Can't remember what they call that,
&gt; but it's not shot peening.

David:
Just &quot;peening&quot; which would be done with a curved chisel-like tool or
possibly a rolling tool under pressure.
Keystoning the seat in is another method- making the inside diameter
smaller than the outside diameter (inside being the combustion chamber
side).
ALL seats are shrunk in, that is, dip the seat in liquid nitrogen, heat
the head in oven, push 'em together. There is ALWAYS some interference
between the parts, that is, the seat OD is bigger than the bore it fits
in, somewhere in the .005-.010 area, I'd guess (I've never done it, so
don't hold me to those numbers).
