Subject: [T2] Interior refit completed

Hi Volks,

I spent the past two days working on the Über-Kamper interior, and  it's
come together beautifully. The carpet I put down on the floor looked so good
I decided to  use it for the seats and upholstery too. While I was at it I
widened the  Z-bed, installed the Jalousie windows from the 73, and attached
a pair of Pioneer 6x9's to the Audiovox AM/FM cassette.

Pictures are up at 
www.geocities_dot_com/vw_type2/Bench.JPG and

Now to get out of the house, and camp in it! Gonna try and pick up the
hubcap on the way home (Sunday or Monday) , assuming it gets to the
Denmeister in time.

Happy trails,

Greg Potts
