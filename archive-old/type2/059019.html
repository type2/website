Subject: Re 69 engine pull alone....

Back in my early 71 Westy ownership, I had occasion to drop the engine a
number of times looking for a leak (cracked case)...This is easily done
with 2 scissors jacks on each side of the sump plate (if using a single
hydraulic jack, I'd use a board that spans heaterbox to heaterbox).  Place
the jacks on a plywood board, which is placed on 2-3 lengths of broomstick
to let you roll it out or in.  I operated both jack handles at once to
easily let it down in a stable non-tippy fashion.
   In these busses where the trans REAR is not held up by separate bolts
and there is NO access plate over the engine, it is easy to drive the bus
up on a couple of 2x6 boards (I used a pyramid of 3 boards nailed
together), and then after removing the brace attachmenets, let the engine
down with the trans until it was parallel to the ground.  Block the trans
up with a concrete block and wooden shims to stay put while you now remove
the top nuts holding the engine- much easier now that they are lower in the
engine compartment!
     Once you have pulled the engine away from the trans (much easier if
jackboard is parallel to the engine), jack it down and roll it back pulling
on the muffler/heat exchanger connections.  On reinstall, one can tip the
engine to get one scissors jack under, then lift the other side (weaklings
can use a long 2x4  on a fulcrum to lift the engine; drop a concrete block
on the end to hold it there, and slip a shim block under the heater box.
Repeat, lifting it higher.  Remember that even if you are lifting 200 lbs,
an 8 ft 2x4 with 7 feet on one side and a foot on the other, means you can
move it with just over 14 lbs of force!  I've used this method alone to
lift type 4 engines high enough to slip a rolling jack underneath.  Once
you are set up on your board holding the jacks, you roll it back adding
broomsticks as they roll off.  Alighnment is easy with a large hammer
tapping on the board to change direction.   The alignment of the pressure
plate ring with the trans shaft is critical- and you must have the flywheel
parallel to the bell housing.  I've done this alone once I got the flywheel
high enough just by lying underneath to look while tapping on the board.
