&gt; &gt;After you've handled a few traffic fatalities where a drunk or some
&gt; &gt;pot-head killed some innocent person
&gt;
&gt;Going beyond the anecdotal testimony of those with law enforcement 
&gt;experience -- one has to wonder: what are the stats on 
&gt;accidents/fatalities caused by
&gt;marijuana use?  I find plenty of people making claims, but little 
&gt;empirical evidence -- in fact some studies that do not support this widely 
&gt;held belief.  It might be more
&gt;accurate to say that use of any impairing drugs, including legal 
&gt;prescriptions and over-the-counter stuff, is dangerous.  But I would 
&gt;really be surprised if many of the
&gt;accidents mentioned were caused by people high on THC -- and nothing else.

I'll say that just about every pot smoker I've ever dealt with formally and 
informally has been the nicest and most laid back people I've ever met. 
Never, ever, ever had a problem with one. Just couldn't say any of them 
were really in any condition to operate anything faster than an armchair... 
&lt;grin!&gt;

Yes - would be interesting to see some stats like you mentioned above. I'd 
expect good numbers (fewer accidents) for those that toke vs. those that 
drink. Bet alcohol and fatigue are the leading causes of accidents.

I would much, much, MUCH rather deal with somebody that's been toking a bit 
much than some fellow that has been par-taking large doses of liquid 
courage! Met some mean mothers in that condition!

That said - I've always wondered why alcohol is okay but a bit of the other 
stuff isn't.... But I guess I'll leave that topic right there as this isn't 
the place for THAT discussion... &lt;grin&gt;
