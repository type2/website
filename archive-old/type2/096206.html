&gt; &gt; Alright, all you camper folks out there! When, in the midst of nature's
&gt; &gt; glory, you bed down for the evening, do you sleep with your head or your
&gt; &gt; feet by the rear hatch?
&gt; 
&gt; Ive slept both ways. hmmm If im alone (or with the daschunds) I like it
&gt; better head to the hatch. feels wombier that way. If the wife or one of
&gt; the
&gt; kids is in there with me we sleep the other way becuase it seems roomier
&gt; on the inside end.
&gt;

never seem to be able to get it perfectly level  so I prefer to sleep
with my head &quot;uphill&quot;  or whichever way my wife preferrs
