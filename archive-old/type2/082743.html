Subject: Spray on Flame Retardant

You can also try a &quot;theatre&quot; supply house.  They have
spray on materials that can be used on on non-fire
retardant materials that help.  I work for a fire
department and this is where we refer people to when
they want to use items in assembly areas that dont
meet flammability requirements.
