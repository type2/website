Subject: Exhaust clamps/source?

Hello Listers:

I'm collecting all the parts for an exhaust/heat system restoration on my 
'76 Campmobile.  I'm unable to locate two of the &quot;oblong&quot; screw clamps that 
secure the blower fan heater tubes to the tops of the heat exchangers.  Does 
anyone know of a source for these clamps?

As usual, TIA for your assistance.

Best regards,
Walt Fogle
