Subject: Re: [T2] speedo cable

You didn't mention what year your bus was...but my speedo cable on a 77 came
off at the speedometer like a cable tv connection. It just screws off and
mine came off easily. Make sure to line up the cable correctly when
reinstalling.

Another tip for anyone interested:

If you have a late bay (73-79) with the turn signal lenses up high, you can
remove the lens and drill through the 2 rivets holding the houseing in.
Slide it out and viola....you can stick your hand right in and undo the
speedometer and look at all your wiring. I put my lens housing back in with
2 self tapping metal screws and it holds great. Now I just remove the
houseing whenever I want to see in there. Sure beats twisting yourself like
a pretzel to get in there from inside the bus (plus I have the a/c in my bus
and it's a hard reach). This trick will also work for doing your radio
antannae on the other side.

Good luck!
