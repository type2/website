&gt; &gt; do you have the bumper heat guard there between the muffler and the
&gt; &gt; bumper, (I can count on one hand the number I've actually seen installed,
&gt; &gt; and have left over fingers)
&gt; &gt;  if not it isn't the bus engine that is running hot but just radiated
&gt; &gt; muffler heat, perfectly normal...
&gt; I have a modified version of that question:
&gt;
&gt; Am I risking overheating with the muffler touching the tinwork just
&gt; rear of the cooling fan? I'm thinking yes since the air being sucked
&gt; into the fan is cooling the hot tinwork. :(

??? probably isn't helping any
