Garp, Liis, Isis &amp; ..... sends:

&gt; so.....given the fact that I can buy the parts, does one have to be a rocket
&gt; scientist to replace all pistons, barrels and heads (1971 upright
&gt; engine ).....and, given the fact that even VW abandonned the idea of a
&gt; 1600cc pushing a loaf, are there any other pitfalls to going for a bigger
&gt; bore, given that the pistons have been dished, and how big can you go ?
&gt; also, how long would this operation take, ie: how long would I be without a
&gt; bus ?

Naah, actually it's really easy.

Your first step is to tear the engine down--instructions for doing this are
in many places. Take the pistons and cylinders that came with the engine and
beat them flat with a large hammer, to prevent their causing you pain any
more. (1641cc usually means a &quot;slip-in big bore&quot; kit was used, which is crap
in a Bug and a disaster waiting to happen in a Bus. And your disaster
already happened.) 

Take the case, crank, cam, rods and heads to a good machine shop and see if
they're still usable. Replace parts as necessary...then order a set of
90.5mm pistons &amp; cylinders from a good stockist. Take these to the machinist
and have him fit your case and heads to these cylinders. Get new bearings, a
seal kit (and make sure you get a main seal!), a tube of Yamabond, and a
tube of Lubriplate Assembly Lube, and go home. Carefully reassemble your
engine.

Install it, put on carburetion, ignition and exhaust, set it up so it runs
good, and you'll be happy.
