Subject: RE: vdo rant

Your symptoms sound like your wiring is to blame and not VDO.

When I first installed mine I ran ground and 12V over from my stereo using
thin wire resulting in similar symptoms: the oil temp would fluctuate with
the the volume level of my stereo.

To make these work right you need a reliable and steady 12V supply (terminal
15) and a good ground on both the gauge side and the engine side (when is
the last time you cleaned the transmission ground strap?). Also a decent
gauge wire from the sender to the gauge so that you do not have a large
voltage drop that would skew your reading.

Again, unreliably high readings.  And when you turn the headlights  on it
maxes out.  Then it decided to stop working for a week or  so.  Then it
starts working again.
