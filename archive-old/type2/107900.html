Subject: Re: [T2] Making Pertronix collar fit

I just installed an 1847A in an 009. After the magnetic collar wouldn't seat
I called the Pertonix tech dept and they said this was a common problem.
They suggested I modify the inside of the collar with a knife or file to
help the fit. I did this and finally got it to go on with quite a bit of
pressure. The good part is I ran it on my old Porsche race car this weekend
and it worked perfectly all the way up to 7600 rpm as the Pertronix tech guy
assured me it would.
