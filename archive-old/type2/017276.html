&gt; &gt;Jan, I would not worry about compromising the &quot;stock-ness&quot;  of the bus.&lt;snip&gt;  Call me crazy but I wanted my 70 to look
&gt; like a 70.  A properly working drum system ain't so bad.

Mark, Jan:
I think there was a booster available in 68-70 for the drum brakes.
Won't help performance much if you are racing down mountains, but will
reduce pedal effort, which might make it more enjoyable or possible for
some people to use a 68-70 vehicle. Does anyone know what's involved in
the changeover? I'd guess it's just  the booster, plumbing, master cyl.
and bracket?
