All looks good to me except for the 45 amps from the heat system.  There is no way it could be drawing that much continuously and be working properly.  After all, VW installed these heaters in busses with 55 amp alternators, did they not?

There is one way to know for sure - beg/borrow/steal a meter and measure it.  If you know someone who has a DC inductive clamp meter, that would be the easiest.
