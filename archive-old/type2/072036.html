Subject: Mr. Buddy makes toasty bus

Just a bit of a consumer report on the Mr. Buddy heater.

I enjoy cool weather, but with cool day temps comes cold evening temps.  I
do believe the best solution is a gas heater, but it takes time to install
one and I want to camp now.  So while shopping at the local Tractor Supply
Store (wonderful place to shop) I picked up a Mr Buddy propane heater.

Growing up when we would stay at Grandma's house, in the winter, she heated
with small gas heaters, so I am used to how they work.

I did buy an extra 8' rubber hose (but the 16' hose would be better) to
attach the heater to a 10 pound bottle sitting outside the bus.  I ran the
hose through the window which left the window open about an inch.  I sat
the heater on my toolbox just behind the passenger seat, but later moved it
more to the center of the bus.  I did purchase a CO detector and layed it
on the counter top behind the drivers seat.

The weather at the Bustoberfest was cool, in the 60's during the day and
dropped into the 40's at night.  Most just kept warm with their sleeping
bags.  But I wanted to try out the heater, so by keeping it on low, the bus
stayed nice and toasty all night.

People have been saying that propane heaters give off moisture, well I
would like to see their data on that.  I have slept in tents that were
unheated and the moisture in one's breath is enough to form droplets on the
inside of the tent walls.  The weather at the campout was moist, but the
only moisture on the bus windows was at the back of the bus (I slept with
my head to the rear of the bus, which kept my toes nice and warm), no other
windows showed any moisture at all.

The heater made my bus feel like a nice warm little cabin in the woods, not
cold and dark, there were no odors and the sound of the heater was very
soothing and it gave off a nice glow.  It was nice in the middle of the
night when I needed to use the restroom, the bus was nice and warm to dress
in and the light was enough to see so I didn't fumble around.  When I
returned as I opened the door, I was greeted with a nice warm interior,
very, very, comforting.

When you place the heater, be careful what you put above it, a lot of heat
comes the top of the heater, so flamable objects should not be placed over
it.

The extra expense is well justified as the plastic surrounding case with
safety cage makes the heater very handy to store and use.

The heater made cool weather camping very pleasant and you can be sure it
will be along with me anytime it may be a little cool at night.
