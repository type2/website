&gt; &gt;Alternatively you can try to install the left caliper on the right and
&gt; &gt;vice versa. I *think* they are symmetric for 71-72 but not positive.
&gt; &gt;Others please correct me.
&gt;
&gt;71-72 calipers can be mounted on the wrong wheel. The calipers may have L/R 
&gt;markings on them and the bleeder screw should be on top if there is only 
&gt;one.

Thanks Richard and Bill...

I really thought I was getting the right calipers on the right wheels, per 
the boxes they were in.  I could have mixed them up, but I exepect I marked 
them with some of that white-out marking pen that you use to correct typos 
on paper.  It makes it easy to write on just about anything, and although it 
is not permanent, it lasts a long time...

No problemo - just pull them off and swap them around.
