Hi all,

This is probably an oft repeated scenario, but nevertheless it's happened 
to me. I'm now up to 3 children in my life, and it's time for a larger 
bus.

I'm interested in getting a '76 9-passenger van to accompany my '76DC. 
I'm figuring that if I have two vans of the same year, I'll be more 
likely to trade things back and forth between them.

So, with that in mind, I'm looking for a good condition (read little to 
no rust) van. I'm willing to travel up to get the van, but I'd like 
something I can drive back rather than have to tow.

I'm located in the SF Bay Area.
