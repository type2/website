Subject: Re: [T2] Faint cricket like noise

It is set at as close to 7.5 as the timing mark allows, dwell of 43,
dipstick was warm, as it was 89 degrees out today.   I'll double check the
timing again.   I guess it is probably just the different metal parts
cooling off.  Thanks

&gt; Sounds like the engine's a tad hot...Next time you drive it try the &quot;dip-
&gt; stick temperature indicator&quot;...You should be able to hold the dipstick
&gt; in your hand...hot, but holdable...Is the distributor set correct? Even
&gt; a little too much advance will over heat the engine... ;-(
