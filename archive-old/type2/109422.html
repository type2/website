Subject: Re: [T2] Paint code/colour

Take a look at you M-code plate and there should be a paint code on there
somewhere. Is the inside of the bus still the original color? If so look
behind the drivers seat and see if the silver paint code tag is still on the
bulk head.There where about three or four different whites for those years.
My guess is that it is most likely L90D/ Pastell White. The type2 library
has some good lists for all the codes under paint once you find it.
