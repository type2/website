&gt; Those two bolts only hold the drum on when the wheel is off right? No loss

I've never had them on in my bus.  My theory is that they are used to keep
the drums on during manufacturing when hub assemblies are moved about.

I prefer to leave them off, as I pull the composite drum every time the
wheel is off to keep it free and check the brakes.
