Subject: Re: [T2] Slip Streaming a Semi on I-95

I'll chime in on this one as well.

Following a house trailer down the interstate many years ago in my 65 bug.

I could easily see under the trailer, but was not drafting or tailgating 
and some 6th sense said watch out!  About that time, one of the wheels 
came loose somewhere in the middle.

I swerved left just as the tire bounced out from under the trailer and
jumped about 50 feet in the air right where i would have been.  Watched it 
in the mirror as it followed the trailer, slowing down and still bouncing 
lower and lower....finally wobbled off to the right side of the road after 
a several hundred feet.

It can happen *any* time.

Still here, dave

&gt; &gt; &gt; I backed off--just couldn't see eating a ribbon of a 10.00 x 20 cap at 80.
&gt; 
&gt; Yep, those things can really fly!  Consider that the top of the tire is
&gt; travelling forward at twice the speed of the vehicle.  If the truck is
