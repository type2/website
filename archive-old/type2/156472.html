Subject: Re: [T2] Water Injection

Water injection reduces the air temperature in the
intake manifold by 65 degrees on the average. This is
the same as most air to air intercoolers. Water
injection does not increase horsepower directly. It
allows you to run more timing with the same octane
fuel without detonation. On cars with knock sensors
the computer can pull timing out. In this circumstance
you can see increased power with water injection even
when no other changes are made. Without a data logger
you will never know if timing is being pulled. You
give away ~5 horsepower for every degree of timing
that is pulled from the engine. It does not make sense
to add 10lbs of boost and pull 8-12 degrees of timing
out. You are giving away 40-60 HP. In our testing we
have seen knock sensors pull 12 degrees of timing out
and never hear it. A properly tuned water injection
vehicle can keep the timing and keep the HP too.
