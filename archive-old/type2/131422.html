Subject: Thanks All!!!

I want to thank everyone for your words of encouragement.

I was really aggravated last night, and couldn't take any more from my bus.

There are a couple more things I'm going to look at when I get time again, 
including the fuel filter (duh... why did I forget that?) and the fuel pump.

It's hard to get enthusiastic about fixing it up when I can't drive it. 
Shoot, there's a brand new muffler setting next to my desk right now that I 
was giving death looks last night. ;-)

I knew going in that I'd need to spend lots of time on the bus. But I had 
assumed that I'd be able to drive and enjoy it during the process.

Now it's time to back away from the bus and appreciate what it's been 
through. Think of it as a child who's been through more than anybody should 
have to go through, and it needs love and tenderness more than anger and a 
wrench.

Again, thanks everyone!

Don
