Subject: Re: [T2] Ignition problem

&gt;The problem: Starter turns over but engine won't start until you release
&gt;the key. Just as you release it the engine starts.

This is a classic symptom of low voltage at the coil. While the starter 
motor is drawing large amps, not enough left for ignition function. Things 
that add to this condition are:

Cross cell flow due to dirty battery
Low or weak battery or charging rate
Poor connections re: battery cables, ground straps, ignition switch &amp; 
circuit, charging circuit
Old starter motor drawing excess amps
Frayed wires
High resistance or leakage from spark plug wires, cap, rotor
Wet or dirty coil or wires
Fouled or over worn plugs

Many times the cause is a synergy of weaknesses in several of the above.


&gt;Other issues: The gen light stays on until about 3000 rpm. At idle the
&gt;alternator makes noise. Engine wiring is very brittle and I don't really
&gt;trust the connections.

See above!!!


&gt;Patient: '70 Bus with stock engine and converted to alternator.
&gt;
&gt;Diagnosis: The mechanic says this is a classic sign of needing a new
&gt;ignition switch. Are their other possibilities or should I bite the bullet
&gt;and tell him to replace it? I've already given him another known working
&gt;alternator but I don't want to spend money on the ignition if I don't need
&gt;to. Thanks.

Boy, you need to find a mechanic who will not assume that one of many 
things is worth changing as an experiment. If there is a problem with the 
ignition switch, it can be verified with simple testing prior to 
contracting for it's replacement. Find a mechanic is knows and applies 
Bentley diagnostic procedures, or just try swapping parts based upon &quot;best 
guess&quot;. Ignore the best procedures given at the peril of your wallet.
