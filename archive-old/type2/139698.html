Subject: Re: [T2] Flange repair

Mark,

Can you see where mine was cut out?

http://www.shockwaverider_dot_com/newengine/picture-003.html

The folks at Busted Bus cut a donor part a little larger than I needed out 
of a dead bus.  I trimmed it to fit and installed it with two sheet metal 
screws.

No one has ever noticed it and much more sheet metal was removed than on 
your bus.

If you must do fiberglass, go to Lowe's and look at the plastic rings that 
go around the base of trees in the garden section....beautiful curves.
As I have said before, I buy a lot of car parts at Lowe's...LOL!

As I have mentioned before, the new rotary compressor went &quot;under&quot; the 
stock sheet metal!

Cheers, dave

&gt; Like a lot of buses, mine was disfigured in order to install AC long

&gt; 
&gt; Really ugly. Don't even know why he bothered, since there wasn't a seal 
&gt; (or front tin pieces -- front is back) installed.
&gt; 
&gt; Now I should probably weld a repair, but I'm not set up to do so. 
&gt; Anyway, this looks like a suitable candidate for a fiberglass repair. 
&gt; It will hardly be visible, and there's very little structural work it 
&gt; has to do except be stiff enough to be a flange. So what's a good way 
&gt; to get that stiffness? Fold a piece of steel the width of the part that 
&gt; folds back, cut to the radius, into the glass? Anyone have a better 
&gt; idea?
