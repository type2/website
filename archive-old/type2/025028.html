Subject: Dropped Valve Seat = Damaged Piston Face

I lost compression on cylinder #2 in my '81 Calif. 
Westy.  After diagnosing &amp; removing the head, I 
discovered a dropped valve seat.  The head is gouged up 
pretty well... I don't think it will be repairable.  
There is also a gouge on the face of the corresponding 
piston (not too large - maybe 2cm long x 5mm deep).  Of 
course I'm on a budget and would like to get back on 
the road fairly quick.  Do I need to replace the 
piston?  Can I just shave off the metal that is 
protruding and live with the gouged up face?  There 
were some tiny metal particles in the oil when I ran my 
finger across the wall of the cylinder - should I worry 
about the damage these particles may have done to the 
bottom end?

Also - I was able to remove the head w/o removing the 
engine.  I wouldn't recommend this... I had to bend up 
a piece of sheet metal.  Definitely easier to just drop 
the engine.  I may end up dropping it anyway to re-
assemble.  I'm worried about the same problem 
reoccuring on the opposite head.  Should I replace this 
now as well (compression looks good)?  Any 
recommendations on sources for heads in Portland, OR?  
I tried Halsey, but they only carry new heads (not bad 
at $300, though).  Any mail-order recommendations?  I 
see a lot of heads that are advertised as robust to the 
dropped seat problem - is this legit or should I just 
go w/new head(s)?  Sorry for the plethora of q's, but I 
know there is a lot of excellent advice to be had on 
the list.
