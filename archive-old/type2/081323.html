Subject: Re: [T2] Re: [T-2]  need decel valve


&gt; &gt; That is correct for your auto trans bus. It should have part number 022
133
&gt; &gt; 551C on it. The large disc style pictured in the Bentley is the manual
trans
&gt; &gt; one, it ends with a B.
&gt; &gt; You should have a U shaped rubber hose between it and the big S with part
&gt; &gt; number 022 201 919C on it.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; What is wrong with your valve?
&gt;
&gt; not positive but when I start it then it idles but after driving it will
&gt; not return to an idle

 Bob
Have you tried disconnecting and capping both large hoses on the decel valve?
Will it return to normal idle? If no, you are getting false air from
somewhere, like the aux air valve elbow....
