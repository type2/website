&gt; I didn't carry a coil in
&gt; those days and we hammered the 10 miles into Ridgecrest to try and find an
&gt; open parts store at 6:00PM on a Sunday.  We were lucky, we caught a guy
&gt; with his key in the lock and he was nice and opened back up for us.
&gt; Otherwise it would have been a long cold night in the Mojave.
&gt;
&gt; A part in the hand is worth many in the parts store.

In the antideluvian period when I was drivin' my first car, an MGA,
I came across another LBC by the side of the road...I stopped and
asked him to just turn on the key and I listened...Silence. So I went
back to my car and fished out a heavy screwdriver and reached be-
hind the rear wheel and gave the Lucas fuel pump a coupla sharp
whacks with the handle of the screwdriver...Tick, tick, tick, tick...
Sometimes the points stick... ;-)
