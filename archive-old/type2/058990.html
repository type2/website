Hi Ben,

I suggest the Ghia mailing list as a great resource for clock info.  They
are always talking about helping each other with clock repair, as I
understand that each and every Ghia came with a VDO clock.

BTW, my reading there has informed me that the VDO clock is really a wind-up
mechanical clock.  The electrical component just turns the mechanical
winder.  Not sure if we are talking the same basic clocks, but I believe we
are...

Subject: Analog Clock Fixable?


When I bought my bus, there was a hole in the dash and I found a clock in
the cupboard under the sink. I can only assume that the clock doesn't work.
However, I have no idea how to go about reattaching it. Does anyone out
there know which of the many spare wires under my dash could be responsible?
Does VDO make a nice after-market alternative? Has anyone ever successfully
fixed a broken original clock?
