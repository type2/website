&gt; &quot;Specially Made for Sears
&gt; Roebuck and Co. by V.E.G.E. Motoren Spijkenisse (Holland).

This is a very well known engine rebuilder (all makes). They are still in
business, see
http://www.vege.nl . That's not a small company doing ones and twos. at a
time.

I think they even did the 'official' rebuilds for VW.
