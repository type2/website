Chances are that one of 2 things happened:

The shift coupler, has snapped, this can bve inpected from under thye bus,
near the trans..

Something in the first or third gear  selector is shot, and it is jammed
between 2 gears...This is serious, and the trans needs tearing down

&gt; Hey folks,
&gt;
&gt; I'm currently at the half way point of a trip I'm doing around the central
&gt; part of the USA.  I live in Boston, and am currently in Appleton, WI.
&gt;
&gt; I have a 1973 VW Camper Bus, 1700/1800cc engine. I had a good used
&gt; transmission installed in my bus just before I left.  My VW mechanic put
this
&gt; in for  me and it worked great, except that shifting into 1st gear was
really
&gt; hard to do unless the bus came to a complete stop.   I didn't think
anything
&gt; of this until part way across the country, it got worse, and quite often
&gt; would have to shift into 2nd gear to get it into first.
&gt;
&gt; I was at an intersection at a full stop in Appleton, when I have to really
&gt; force it into first and suddenly when it took I heard a &quot;Ka-Chunk&quot; noise
from
&gt; under the bus.  It seems the transmission is now locked into 3rd gear, and
I
&gt; can't seem to release it no matter what I do.   It reminds me of what the
&gt; transmission in my old Ford Pickup truck was like - shifter on the
steering
&gt; wheel - when I would shift it from 3rd into 1st it would lock up, and I'd
&gt; have to go under the hood and pull up on the linkage which would release
it.
&gt;  Is this what has happened?  I don't know if busses even have linkage).
&gt;
&gt; My 2 questions are
&gt;
&gt; 1. Is this something I can work on myself (fairly easily) - releasing the
&gt; linkage somehow, or will I need to have a garage do this for me?
&gt;
&gt; 2. If I need to go to a garage, is there a decent reputable VW Bus repair
&gt; place anywhere nearby?
&gt;
&gt; I'd appreciate any thoughts on this ASAP.   Thanks!
&gt;
&gt; Chris
