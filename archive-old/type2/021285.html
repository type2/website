Eron:
The cool thing about using a &quot;water puppy&quot; type pump is that you could turn it
on only when needed, like climbing hills or when temps get really high. Keep in
mind, though, that you'll need to put anti-freeze in it before exposing to
freezing conditions. That's something air-cooled people tend to forget!
BTW, the water/oil cooler this thread is talking about is used on ALL 2.1
waterboxers, Diesel Vanagons and turbo diesels for sure, maybe other water
cooled VW's too.
