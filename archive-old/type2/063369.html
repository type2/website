Subject: Gas Smell Gone - Upper Filler Connector and Vent line 

My gas smell/leak is solved.  The upper connector on the filler tube was
a piece of garbage and the vent line connector that is located underneath
the spare tire well was pretty much history.  I believe that was the major
reason I smelled gas.  Also for those of you who seem to have gas
come out with certain pumps at certain stations the problem I would
guess is that it is upper connector.  $18 from VW and around the same
from Bus Boys but they were out last time I checked.  The bottom
connector was in excellent shape so I didn't replace.  I did about 20 laps
around Annapolis with my heat on and my dog as co-pilot. Filled the tank
all the way up and the only smell I got up front was smelly air cooled
engine.  A beautiful smell at that.  Had my girlfriend sniff around the van
and no smell. Thanks fo the help everyone!
