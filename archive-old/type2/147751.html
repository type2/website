Hey guys-

I'm replacing the cassette deck in my Westy with a CD player; I wonder
if any of you might be interested in the &quot;old&quot; deck. It's a Pioneer
KEH-4000 with &quot;Supertuner&quot; and detachable face. I don't know anything
else about it except that it works great, and I'd be willing to let it
go for $20 plus actual shipping to anyone from the list who wants it.
If I can extract the DIN sleeve without completely tearing it up I'll
include it as well. Drop me a line and it's yours! Cheers-

JJ
