Subject: Re: [T2] 72 pushrod tubes

Woops...my apologies...at the time I only noticed Phil's response and no 
others. I didn't mean to imply that the other ideas wouldn't work.

Sorry if it appeared that way. I imagine a stap wrench would work, though I 
haven't tried it. Personally I would be a bit worried that it would crush 
the tube. I was just outside changing the oil and filter in the big ole RV 
we are selling and the filter didn't want to come off. Using the strap 
wrench kept crushing the oil filter rather than moving it. Granted it was a 
cheap strap wrench and the filter was on there good.

&gt; What about a strap wrench?
&gt; It'll pull evenly around the whole outside circumference of the tube and
&gt; shouldn't crush it.
