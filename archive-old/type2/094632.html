Subject: Re: [T2] So a fellow paints his bus

The trick to the Maaco and Earl Schieb paint jobs is in the prep.  How 
well YOU prep the vehicle.   all body filling had to be done by you, and 
their quicky job of drop it in the morning and get it the next day.  I 
use the quickie job on some projects i did.  but the vehicle was dragged 
over with nothing on it, and all lights removed and all the masking 
done.  This took several days for two people to do.  Longer if we ran 
into body work to do and rust to knock  off.  their quicky job of drop 
it in the morning and get it the next day was still  a  lot of advance 
work.  but then our labor rate was cheaper than about 30 man hours of 
shop labor.  And then we did the rub out which was about another 10 man 
hours.  Another thing is the paint price you mentioned.  This may have 
included the shop supplies bill also.

&gt;&gt; I received a rediculous quote on the weekend to paint my bus.  It was
&gt;&gt; $5,000, not including any parts.  1 week to prep, 1 week to paint, 1/2
&gt;&gt; week to put back together.  The cost of the paint alone was $1000.

&gt; Maaco will probably do it in about a day for 500 bucks or so. (at least,
&gt; when we had a shop Astro painted, thats what it cost.  Had white window
&gt; rubber, a white trailer hitch, white inner wheel wells, white spotted
&gt; tires, white radiator, white lower frame rains....good thing I'd removed
&gt; everything that bolted on...else we'd have had a white sunroof frame and
&gt; seal, a white grill, white tail lights....probably a white license plate
&gt; too.  And spots of that paint job (door handle recesses) were peeling 
&gt; in 2
&gt; weeks.)
