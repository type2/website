&gt;&gt;My take on &quot;reliability&quot; is that if the vehicle gets you where you're going,
&gt;&gt;when you want it to, then it's &quot;reliable.&quot;  If parts are replaced when those
&gt;&gt;crafty Germans say they should (DM), then they are most unlikely to fail
&gt;&gt;under use.
&gt;
&gt;What is the recommended replacement interval for the gas pedal 
&gt;hinge?  I've seen a few people on this list with broken ones and it left 
&gt;them more-or-less stranded, unless they McGyvered up something to get them 
&gt;home.

Can't say I've had that particular problem.  Sounds like a good application for
&quot;bailing wire&quot; AKA &quot;mechanic's wire,&quot;  I keep a spool in every vehicle.  It 
also
comes in handy (with a butt end crimp on connector and a round terminal) for
fixing broken bug accelerator cables--when they break going into the tube at
the pedal end.  I've had that happen three times in the past eighteen years.

&gt;&gt;Within only a few hours, they discovered that a mouse had eaten
&gt;&gt;through the ignition wire going to the coil.  Only took eight days for him to
&gt;&gt;get his car back.
&gt;
&gt;&lt;snip&gt;
&gt;
&gt;&gt;So which car is more &quot;reliable&quot;?
&gt;
&gt;You will always be able to find an example here or there of a newer 
&gt;vehicle that fails.  My argument is that the 0-3 year old Saturn would 
&gt;still be more reliable in the long run than an old bus, even one that's 
&gt;properly maintained.  My wife bought a '96 Saturn new, and we just sold it 
&gt;a few months ago with 100k miles on it.  It never once left her stranded.

Saturns aren't built for the &quot;long run.&quot;  Do you honestly believe that you 
will see any
on the road in thirty years?

My point is that the driver's ability to deal with situations is a part of 
the &quot;reliability&quot; equation.
It's not just the sum of the parts that happen to be connected together at 
the time.

&gt;My '73 camper is a 30-year-old vehicle, things go wrong simply from old 
&gt;age.  That's not a problem for me, and it's not even a problem for my 
&gt;wife, because she knows I can fix most things that would leave us stranded 
&gt;(bless her heart) but I would never fault anyone for wanting to drive 
&gt;something more reliable than a bus.

I simply don't believe there IS anything more reliable than a PROPERLY 
MAINTAINED bus
driven by someone with tools, spare parts, and the intent to get there and 
back.

&gt;I can't even recommend with a clear conscience that my mom buy an older 
&gt;bus - she does NOT need to be worrying about mechanical problems.

It's my opinion...............that AC VWs are for driver/mechanics ONLY.
Perhaps also those *lucky* enough to find a good Doktor.
LOLs rarely (never?) have what's needed for that sort of thing.  Fortunately,
they rarely drive too far, and so tend not to wear new cars out too much.

&gt;  I'm trying to get her into a newer Eurovan Westy.

.......or any other mommy van.  Frankly, at this stage of the bus'
evolution (devolution?), I see them as nothing more.  F. Porche would
not be pleased.

'70 Westy &quot;The Carcass&quot;                             for faults in the

delusion.   R. Hunter
