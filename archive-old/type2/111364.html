Subject: re new Mexican Bosch Vacuum Distributor

Ah Ha!

I have just done similar research to fit a svda dizzy
to my 1600 bus.  The vacuum it ported vacuum, so it
only works as you open the throttle.  I set mine to 32
deg full advance with the vacuum hose blocked.  If you
want to check the vacuum advance, block the port on
the carb (32pict3???) then suck on the end of the
hose.  If the engine is stopped and cap off you should
see the plate move.  If the engine is running with the
timing light connected you should see some advance
happen.  I was concerned because with vacuum and mech
advance I was getting over 40 deg total advance.  This
only happens at part throttle settings, not flat out
so helps it run more efficiently (less dense smaller
shot needs more burn time)

Hope this helps.
