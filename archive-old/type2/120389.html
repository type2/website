Subject: Thinsert sparkplug hole sleeve questions

Hi everyone:
 
I just purchased a Thinsert sleeve from the Bus Depot to fix a stipped sparkplug hole.  Does anyone have tips on installing this?  I have read the archive and know that I have to use a tap to drill out the stipped hole to get the insert in there, does anyone know what size tap to use, or basically how to do this repair?  Thanks.
