Hey there,

Boating and Marine upholstery shops are good sources for canvas work
too. Since you're in the bay area, I'm sure that there are a couple
around.

Up here in New England when boating season is done, some of these
shops offer great prices on auto upholstery jobs just to make ends
meet during the winter. Usually they are more then happy to do
non-marine work in the off season (tent repair, screen replacement,
etc, etc).

Guess where I'm having my front seats re-upholstered this winter 8^)
