I have 1979 FI Westy. I decided to give the Compufire electronic ignition a
try. (I'm tired of playing around with points) I installed it today and it
seems to work well. I checked the dwell and was surprised to see it was over
60. Can this be right? I was hoping that someone could shed some light on
this. Also the rotor didn't fit after I installed the Compufire unit, I had
to shave down the bottom of it to line it up properly. Does anyone have a
better way of dealing with this?
Thanks...
Ronnie
