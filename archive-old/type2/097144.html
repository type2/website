Subject: [T2] Fresh air flaps


&gt; My fresh air flaps are so rusty I can't tell if they were painted vw black
or body color. &gt;
&gt;
Its not my flaps that are in bad shape but my grill is really pitted and has
small areas of rust.  Any ideas on repair would be appreciated.  I imagine
sandblasting is an option.
