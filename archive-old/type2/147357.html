  &gt;   I've got an 81 Vanagon, automatic.
&gt;   She starts right up, even after sitting for a week.
&gt;   But when I stop at a store and come back a few minutes later, she doesn't want to start back up.
&gt; h, she cranks real good - the starter is fine, but she won't catch.  Only way I can get her
&gt;   to start is to floor the accelerator and crank it for thirty or forty seconds straight.  She starts....so far.
&gt;   When she is running she runs great.  Idles and accelerates beautifully.   
&gt;   I thought it might be the fuel filter and switched that, but it didn't help.
&gt;   Weird, huh?  Sitting for a week and everything is fine, but two minutes and no go!
&gt;   I would greatly appreciate any help you can give.

Take a look at the Temp sensor II. Measure the resistance on this sensor 
at engine running temp and cold. Bentley has the specs in it. This could 
be the problem.
