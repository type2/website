Subject: $10,500.00 + for a '78 westy???!!! Gufaw!!!!

Marty and All,

First of all, I'm gonna assume that this is not a joke (some guy
claiming he turned down $10,500.00 for a fully restored '78)...

Of course, there's always the possibility that you left out some
pertinent information, such as: 
 A) This bus was powered by Cadillac and was once owned by Elvis.   
 B) It was actually a splittie owned by Jerry Garcia (all roaches,
used guitar picks and SERIOUSLY used groupies included).
 C) It's gold plated.
 D) It's a top-secret military version with stealth technology.
 E) It was &quot;restored&quot; by Rockwell International with the intention of
selling it to the U.S. Airforce (Nah, it's too cheap).

It's also possible that the guy's just full of sh/t. That or he's been
smokin' too much crack!!!

However, if you choose to buy it at that price, I've got a lovely
bridge for sale....CHEAP!!! It's the London Bridge, LOTS of history!!!
Just $20,000.00 (USD), Shipping not included (F.O.B. Lake Havasu,
Arizona, U.S.A., Planet Earth).

DISCLAIMER: THE ABOVE IS ABSOLUTELY NOT TRUE. IN FACT, IT IS A PATENT
LIE. EVERYONE KNOWS THAT WHILE THE LONDON BRIDGE IS IN FACT IN LAKE
HAVASU, LAKE HAVASU IS NOWHERE NEAR THE PLANET EARTH!!!!
