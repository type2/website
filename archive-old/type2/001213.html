    Hi. Just came home from a friends whom just purchased a 71 Westy.
The engine has been replaced with what the PO say's is an 1800(1776?).
Is there anyway to tell without tear down and measurements? It sure performs
better than my 73 with the stock 1700. Today we removed the valve covers and
also the breather hoses to them and installed the stock covers to help clean
up the engine bay and because the 3/4 cover was always about 1/3 full of oil
when you removed it! Something with the breather hose I guess. We also bled
and adjusted the brakes and even tried bleeding the master cylinder through
the pressure switches but the pedal still seems spongy. Is this a MC prob?
   Does anyone know the web address to the data plate site? We'd like to
check out just what he has. (It has the belly pans welded in place as well
as the external power recept. only has 2 round prongs(European?) Everything
else looks like a standard mustard yellow vinyl
interior Westy.

Thanks for any input.
