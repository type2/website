Subject: RE: [T2] Oil Pressure Light

URGENT: Don't run the engine with the oil pressure light on!

With that being said, sometimes after an oil change it can take a little
longer than usuall for the oil pressure to come up on the first start. This
is especially true if you chamged the filter as well. Assuming that it's not
very cold where you are, I would expect to see oil pressure come up in 15
seconds or so. Maybe a little longer if it's near freezing.

Just to check, you did refill with the correct amount of new oil? I forgot
to do that once.

If you have enough oil and the pressure still won't register you need to
look at:

1) Pressure sender: might have failed, but awfully coincidental on the
timing...

2) Oil pump: Other listees know more than I, but possibly blocked by foriegn
object in the sump, or possibly lost its prime?
