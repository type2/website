Subject: complete gasket set

&lt;&lt; I bought a complete gasket set for my 1800 to do the rebuild.  now it
looks like I will be splitting the case and putting new bearings in the
bottom end as well.  What other gaskets or seals, if any, will I need now?
Is everything I need in the kit?
 Thanks,
 Ed Maikranz &gt;&gt;

  You also need a front crankshaft seal (flywheel end), a rear crankshaft
seal (fan pully end), the six little vibration dampners that go on the case
thru bolts. You may also want to make note of any of the boots or grommets
on the engine tin that you find to be old and falling apart, like the oil
pressure
sender boot, the altenator cooling elbow, grommets for oil filler pipe,
heater booster hoses and fuel &amp; electric passing thru the front engine tin.
And don't forget the engine compartment seal. You'll be glad to have all of
these ready to go when it's time to reassemble everything.
