	Dave,

	I did the same thing to my bus about a year ago.  It was obvious
that rain
	would collect in the channel underneath the seal and it would cause
problems
	later.  I decided to drill 5-6 holes evenly spaced in the bottom of
the
	channel.  I used a small bit (5/32) which is plenty large enough for
water to
	escape, but not large enough to damage the integrity of the channel.

I know Karmann Ghias have weep holes by design (at the lowest points in the
opening) and I'd be surprise if other VW didn't have them as well.  The
problem is that over time, if you live by the ocean, the dew and/or fog will
keep your frame constantly wet and contains enough salt to eat through the
paint.  Like the other guys said, use the best rust inhibitor you can and
lots of it.  Another thing that worked for me to waterproof areas is
fiberglass resin.
