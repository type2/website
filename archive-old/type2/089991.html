Subject: Re: [T2] oil pressure

--part1_1bc.cdf90c4.2aa6503f_boundary

Hello All    Just got back from The Bug-out in Manaassa Va. It rained all day 
but people came anyway. Continued the oil pressure and temp test in the 59 
panel with 1835cc motor. This time I used Mobli1 15-50 oil and wrapped the 
oil filter in header wrap. Going up ran 240 degrees and pressure was about 40 
psi. this was fully loaded and a bunch of doors on the rack. Coming home 
without the rack(Sold it ) ran 220 degrees and presuure at 44 psi. got 19 mpg 
going up and  21 coming home.This was the best temps and pressures I have 
seen and can only think that the major reason was the Mobil1 oil.  Later and 
have fun  Mark Dearing  Salem Import Service Salem Va
