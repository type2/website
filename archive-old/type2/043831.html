Hi,

Wayne writes:

&gt; I am converting a 86syncro Vanagon to a car hauler for
&gt; bugs and buses and wish to put more truck like tires
&gt; and wheels in place of the stock 5 lugs and all I can
&gt; find so far are late model Mercedes(too pricey),any
&gt; ideas will greatly appreciated. Stock wheels are 14&quot;
&gt; and I hope to find 16&quot; or so to fit my hubs.        

 Best bet would no doubt be the 16&quot; wheels from an
early syncro, but I gather they are pretty hard to
come by...

 Here's a list of alternative wheels from a UK bulletin
Board, it's copied from a German source and translated so
don't put too much store in it... however it should provide
a good place to start looking. Note that because it lists,
say, &quot;Passat&quot;, that doesn't mean that all Passat wheels
are even 112x5 (let alone correct offset etc) but that 
_some_ Passats had 112x5 (the six cylinder ones, I think).

 Sean comments that some of these may not be available in
&quot;England&quot; (He means the UK :-). Obviously that also applies
to the US, where Seat Alhambras, for example, are probably
not very widely available....
 These are also mostly cars, not &quot;trucks&quot;, so it is probably
more useful for alloys than steel rims.

Cheers,
