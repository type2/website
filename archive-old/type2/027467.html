What gauge wire should I use to wire up a set of 12V
reading lights by the rear seat of my van?

I plan to tap off the center dome light to the rear,
and I expect it will be about 12-16 feet of wire.  No fuses...

I am going out to buy the wire as soon as I get a quick
response from the list.

So, let's hear recommendations for the gauge/gage/guage wire!!
