   Don't forget the two screws that come up from underneath.
I thought &quot;barely&quot; was an odd term to see in Bentley and after going through
this I would say it's an understatement.
   I also experienced a very alarming puddle. I'd filled up and parked slanted
to the right. A few minutes later a friend says &quot;Whats that dripping from your
bus&quot; sheesh I still shudder.
  I couldn't find an appropriate hose anywhere, so as a stop gap I coated the
outside of the hose with Duro liquid black rubber and wrapped it with a strip
of heavy rubber roofing material. So far, so good. Also I never go past the
first click at the pump.  When I get around to pulling my engine, I'll go with
the Gates hose and metal bend, unless someone (Ron?) comes up with something
better.
   Merry Christmas and thanks for all the information and inspiration.
