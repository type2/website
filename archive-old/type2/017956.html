    I'm not sure if your poptop hinge is really faulty ( I mean,
obviously the bent part needs replacing) as there seems to be some sort
of design feature here that &quot;balances&quot; the top while you're trying to
lift it, and doesn't work if you add any weight at all. At least that's
what I've found with mine. I put on a Yakima rack, which weighs very
little, and one of those plastic clamshell carriers, which also weighs
very little  -- probably the total is around 50lbs max, and the front
rack is, of course, right over the hinge anyway. 
    But it's impossible to lift, even with nothing in the carrier. Take
it off, the top lifts right up. I was really surprised, because I would
have thought that I could lift it with just a little extra effort, even
with my two sailboards on the rack. Kind of a bummer -- I don't know if
there's any &quot;fix&quot; for it, although hydraulics come to mind.
