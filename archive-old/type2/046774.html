Subject: [T2] Valve job:  Thanks everyone!

Well, thanks to all of your collective help, I've no officially gotten a
clue.  I traced the wire from Cylinder 1 to the dizzy and found it was
indeed opposite of the mark on my dizzy.  When the rotor is at the firing
point for the #1 cylnder, the rotor is actually facing cylinder #3.  Thanks
for all your patience and help!

I made a list of which valves are shut when each cylnder is at TDC for my
bus, by my observations alone today.  Maybe it will help someone else, maybe
I've been smoking too much discount kitty litter.  With this information, a
novice like me would be able to tell which cylnder was at TDC by seeing
which valves are closed, when the notch in the flywheel is pointing at 0
degrees.  It is easier to just follow the spark plug wire from cylnder 1 to
the dizzy, but if you've really given the pooch some lovin and pulled all
your wires out, this may help!

  My valve numbering sequence
               Front of Bus
     Left Head       Right Head
          *******          *******
      #5 *     *           *     * #1
      #6 *     *           *     * #2
           *     *           *     *
      #7 *     *           *     * #3
      #8 *     *           *     * #4
          *******          *******
                Rear of Bus

Valves 1,2,3,8 are closed when cylnder 1 is at TDC.
Valves 1,3,4,6 are closed when cylnder 2 is at TDC.
Valves 4,5,6,7 are closed when cylnder 3 is at TDC.
Valves 2,5,7,8 are closed when cylnder 4 is at TDC.


Now that that part is sorted, I have aquestion about the gap.  I'm a little
fuzzy on what a bit of drag on the 0.006 feeler guage, but not too much, is
exactly.  After you've adjusted the gap to 0.006, should a 0.007 feeler be
able to get in tightly or not at all?  If the 0.007 can get in tightly,
would a 0.008 be a complete no go?  I know I'm probably being waaaaaaaay to
anal here, but I just want to do a good job fixing my bus and earn bad
habits later.  Hmmmm... maybe I ought to check the gap on my _at_ss and adjust
there instead. ; )

A very grateful,

Landon &amp; Karen
