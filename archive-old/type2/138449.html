Subject: RE: [T2] Nut size on fan end of generator

Miles said:

&quot;  p.s. My '71's mechanical fuel pump doesn't conflict with the alternator 
in any
way.  Never even considered it!  Maybe it's a problem with different years?&quot;

From the type 2 library:

Generator to Alternator Swap
by Jim Thompson and images thanks to Dale Mueller

&quot;Ron Van Ness writes:

Alternator conversion kits typically come with an alternator pedestal (the 
stock generator pedestal will not work with the alternator without 
modification), three fan mounting tin pieces (which are very thin compared 
to the original German pieces), an alternator clamp, and a 55 watt 
alternator with internal regulator (Kymco does sell a higher output 
alternator). Because of the poor quality of the tin and problems some have 
fitting the cheap alternator pedestal casting that are included with the 
typical aftermarket kit, it is often wiser to locate the better made German 
pieces from a '73-'74 bug which came stock with an alternator. Also, to 
clear the alternator, a '73-'74 alternator charged bug fuel pump is required 
(113 127 025G) as well as a shorter push rod (113 127 307A) to match the 
pump.

Dale Mueller provides the following:

1. Modifications to fuel system with Alternator

With the installation of an alternator, the fuel system has had to be 
modified as follows:

a - Pump inclined 15 degrees to the left
b - Pump push rod length: 100 mm (3.937 in.), previously: 108 mm (4.252 in.)
