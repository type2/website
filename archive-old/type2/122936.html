I believe you can get duct tape in a VW colors.
So it shouldn't be a problem to find those necessary colors.

Home Depot has green, blue, yellow, red
Im sure there are more out there

;)

And yes, I think the grills are the same color as the main body. So far
all the ones Ive seen are.

&gt;Hey Guys,
&gt;
&gt;     When looking at a FACTORY VW Transporter from 1973, what color should 
&gt;the bumper mounting brackets in the rear be painted? Should they be painted 
&gt;the color of the bumpers? Or the color of the body?
&gt;
&gt;My Bus when I got it, with the exception of the roof, was all one color. 
&gt;I'm trying to revert this Bus back to stock looking as much as possible.
&gt;
&gt;Also, the air vent grill should always be the same color as the body, 
&gt;correct?
