Subject: Special Bartnik/Van Ness Tech Site

Due to continuing problems with the type2_dot_com web server, nobody has been
able to update anything on the site lately although it still runs. Both
Sean Bartnik and Ron Van Ness have been wanting to do significant updates,
so we've brought up an alternative page.

	http://buslist/dynip_dot_com

Sean and Ron can fill you in better on exactly what's been updated but I
know there is a high demand for the gas heater wisdom this time of year and
that section of Ron's page has grown. Click the Bartno-Tek and Ness-Tek
buttons.

Please DO NOT LINK other pages to this site as it is temporary. Service may
be sporadic and it may go down entirely if RoadRunner decides to block my
http port or discontinue my service (these little Motorola cable modems
make bitchin' web servers though. 8)

Soon we'll import the entire Library of Josh Rodgers as well, his provider
decided to actually enforce their disk quotas and that ruined the Library.

Also I know that some of the buttons don't work so please do not write and
tell me that. The buttons that don't work on the one site, do work on the
other. Mix &amp; match. Have fun. =^ )
