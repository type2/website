Subject: Re: [T2] clutch from 1700 with 2000 engine

My post wasn't very clear, I'm afraid.
I'm having a new engine put into my 73 Bus. My bus is stock with the
original clutch and tranny. What I was wondering, is will the 2000cc engine
be a direct replacement without modification to the stock 73 clutch? Are any
other modifications needed for the 2000? If so, I will go with the 1800cc
engine.
Thanks,

Tom
