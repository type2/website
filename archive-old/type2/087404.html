&lt;&lt;   Is that still a type one engine? If not how hard is it to do the

conversion?


Still type one on the 71, but not exactly a Bug engine. The bus engine
was set up to accept the moustache bar hanger. I had the standard
Bug engine in my 71 for years but got into the habit of checking the
oil pump cover adaptor regularly for looseness, even with nylocks.
Love to have both....The later top cover for the engine compartment
and the removable valence below the engine lid of the pre-72's...
