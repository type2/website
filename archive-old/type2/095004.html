Subject: Re: &lt;FMBC&gt; 71 Single Cab Wiring Harness

I agree,  they should be pretty  much the same

I wouldnt just cut that wire though, it could cause a drain situation if 
there is an open &quot;wire&quot; so to speak.

Plus you coudl take the wire and use it to power something else into your 
drivers cab,   maybee a light for the truck bed

&gt;
&gt;If I had to guess, I'd say there is a small difference, and that's the
&gt;interior light, in a passenger bus, there's two interior lights(I'm 
&gt;assuming
&gt;it's the same on a bay as on a split), whereas there's only one on a single
&gt;cab.  The remedy for this would be to just cut the wire for the second
&gt;interior light off of the harness.  That's the only difference that I know
&gt;of.  Good luck with the wiring.

&gt;
&gt;
&gt; &gt; Would anyone happen to know if a wiring harness for a 71 Single cab 
&gt;would
&gt;be
&gt; &gt; the same as for the same year bus?  I need a new wiring harness to make 
&gt;my
&gt; &gt; life easier and have found the harness for the 71 211 971 028J  from Bus
&gt; &gt; Depot for $146.50.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Any comments one way or another would be appreciated on quality if you
&gt;have
&gt; &gt; used this part.
