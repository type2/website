He has driven mine &amp; would still get another, but his wife - well that's
another story. She liked the bus &amp; the statement it made (UK any-way). Still
hoping we'll take so long repairing his bus &amp; re-spaying it, not to mention
selling it, that he'll have his licence back!

On the matter of knowing the box is slack &amp; the brake were bad, the steering
box pivots were so stiff that it felt as tight as new! The brakes were a bit
poor, certainly not good enough to pass a safety test. But he was a bit
paranoid about others driving his new pride &amp; joy, or I would have warned
him (he even brought the bus without a test drive- DUH) He did not know what
to expect from a heavy 20 yr. old bus, so accepted what he was given.

Moral of the story - Trust NO ONE, test drive, inspect, ask questions, take
a professional or experienced person with you if possible &amp; if you still
can't be sure WALK AWAY! Think it over, look at the evidence &amp; trust your
gut.

Peace
