Subject: carb gasket sealant

When I'm putting gaskets on my carbs  -  Kadrons have three or four to
contend with  -  I would like to coat the gaskets with something to
minimize the possibility of air leaks. I don't want to use any of the usual
Permatex, Loctite, or other sealants because they dry out and are difficult
to remove. I would rather use something with the constency of wheel bearing
grease which will remain viscous but seal against air leaks.

Does anyone have a recommendation for a product which will do this but will
not attack gasket material?
Jack
