&gt;Hi Derek;
&gt;I don't get it.  When you went to tighten the heads down the studs are 
&gt;turning and you can only get 7 to 9 ft/lbs?  So the studs are turning with 
&gt;the cylinder head nuts.
&gt;How did you install your new studs into the case?
&gt;When I did mine I pulled all the studs and case savers.  I removed the studs. 
&gt; Cleaned everything up, installed the studs into the case savers with lock 
&gt;tight (red).  Then I installed the case saver-stud assemble into the case 
&gt;again with red lock tight.  I used two nuts tightened against each other on 
&gt;the head end of the stud when I installed the case saver-stud assemble.  
&gt;Is the stud turning in the case saver?
&gt;Is the case saver turning in the case?
&gt;What happens when you keep turning?
&gt;Have you removed the part that keeps turning and inspected it?
&gt;There has to be a simple explanation for this.  Just look into it a little 
&gt;further and you'll find it.

Tim,
your correct.  the stud is turning (coming out) when I tighten up the 
nut after the head is on the cylinders.  The case saver seems to be 
hard fast in the case.  Not moving.  This part is good.

I just followed Wilson on the installation of the studs.  A little 
gasket sealer on the threads and twist into the case savers.  No 
locktite or anything.  Initially.  As I mentioned, yesterday I did clean
up the threads as best I could and put some red locktite on it.  I'm 
not convinced it will work.  And even if it holds, it could still
fail 5000 to 10000 miles from now.  This is just one stud of 16.  The
rest of the 1/2 head studs still haven't been torqued to spec.  AND
I still need to get over to the 3/4 head side!  Very discouraging.
On the good side,  I'm not as upset as I was Yesterday when it happened.
Time heals all wounds.  I just came to the realization that the engine won't be in the bus as soon as I thought it would be.  

The few responses I received thought I should break down and get a new 
case.  That would really bum me out because I spent about $130.00 at the 
machine shop getting this case ready to build.  If this wasn't my 1st
time doing this I might have looked at the case a little closer.
New cases are running around $400? w/ the full flow tapping and shipping
Might need new main bearings too.  The bus is going to be a keeper so 
I'm at least going to look into it.

You know, one thing I learned was that if the engine has overheated in
the past then the case material can get stressed.  Soft; and threads can
fail.  This might be the third thread set to do so on this case.
When I got the bus and pulled the engine the blades from the fan were 
strewn about the fan housing and head fins. A couple blades had cut fins
up pretty good (ie. whole lot of force).  The #3 spark plug hole looked
like it had literally been blown out from the piston pressure. 
 
In retrospect, I've come to the conclusion that the following events 
happened.  The fan explodes sending blades flying,  the engine very 
quickly heats up,  #3 cylinder gets the hottest (pre doghouse oilcooler)
and the plug threads heat up to the point that they cannot hold the plug 
in the head and POW... the plug comes flying out, engine dies and is 
towed home.  I come by 8 yrs later and plunk my money down.  I try to 
save some scratch by using an obviously overheated case and quite 
possibly am about to learn the hard way what we all know deep inside us:
you've got to start with a good foundation.

This experience has led me to my own signature line.  they seem to be 
popular on the list.  I'll use it till I'm feeling cocky and think that
shortcuts are the right way to get things done.  Hopefully never =)
