Subject: Towing with a bus

Why doesn't a VW bus (auto) have a transmission cooler?  Has anyone ever 
fitted one to their bus?  Has anyone ever installed a transmission 
temperature gauge?  Where is the best place for a sender?
It's very hilly here where I live and I've been thinking about towing a 
lightweight trailer with my '78 camper this summer, but I kind of always 
thought of the auto tranny as a weak point.  I'd hate to do anything to 
hasten its demise, but the additional room for gear on a small trailer would 
be great.
