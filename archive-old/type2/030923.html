&gt; &gt; Now I need new tires and wheels. The old wheels are in terrible, rusty

&gt; As for tires, the optimum choice is 185R14, load range C or D.  Tire

there is a difference between &quot;optimum choice&quot; and &quot;original equipment&quot;

the 185R14 is an older design and much narrower than some other tires

&gt; 195-75R14s, but stick to your guns and have them order 185R14s for

there is nothing wrong with 195-75R14s not original but very roadworthy.

the important thing is the load range, you need &quot;light truck&quot; tires for
the weight of a Type 2

personally I use  205/70R14s on mine, Michelin MXT's   but these are an
expensive special order tire.  but IMO (and I have been driving these
things since 1969) the best tire I ever had under my van
