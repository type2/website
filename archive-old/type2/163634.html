&gt; If your looking for a safe ride--any VW  isn't on top of the list of &quot;I
&gt; walked away from it&quot; catagory.
&gt; If your worried about this possibility--better start looking for a late
&gt; 40's to late 50's Power Wagon, or maybe a 59-60 Olds Fiesta wagon
&gt;
&gt;
The car maybe, but not the driver...Something that &quot;solid&quot; isn't built
to absorb any impact and the energy in the impact is transmitted to
the driver. It's the secondary impact that gets you...when you're
bouncing around the inside of the car... :-(
