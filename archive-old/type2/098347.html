Subject: Re: [T2] Alternator light on

&gt; OK it seems this is normal from the replies I've received.  This
morning I did start the bus WITHOUT using the gas pedal and this explains
why the light came on for the first time.

A type 1 alternator seems to light the light until the engine is blipped a
tiny bit from first startup.  I've no idea about as type IV

Compared to a &quot;conventional&quot; alternator, a type 1 alternator does not spin
nearly as fast.  My guesstimate observing pulley sizes is that the type 1
alternator spins about half as fast as a typical watercooler alternator.
This may have something to do with the light staying on.

Keep an eye on it, and if it makes a habit of coming on, or stays on at
higher RPM, do something about it!
