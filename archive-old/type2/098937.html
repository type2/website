Subject: Voltage regulator??

My bus has recently come down with the hiccups.  when she's at idle 
everything is cool, but when you put a load on her, her lights twitch,IE: 
dim,then brighten, dim agian.  I went by the ever infamous schucks to have 
them test the elec. sys. and everything was excellent. so i thought maybe 
it's the Voltage Regulator???  If there is anything else that may be the 
prob. I am always, open for ideas.

            THANK YOU!!!!!!!!!!!!
