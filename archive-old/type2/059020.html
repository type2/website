&gt; 	Howdy. I bought a '74 hardtop a few months ago, with the stock 
&gt; 1800 pancake/dual carbs, and have noticed a discrepancy with the old 
&gt; dipstick grab-with-yer-fingers oil temp test. I've noticed that while 
&gt; pulling into a gas station and scurrying round the back in a hurry, 
&gt; things seem docile. However, after pumping gas and buying a drink, the 
&gt; stick's temperature seems to go up markedly. Is this because the hot oil 
&gt; needs to drain into the sump first, or because no more airflow is 
&gt; cooling the block?

Airflow, I'd wager - without it, heat has a chance to rise 
through the engine (and to the dipstick); with it, the heat
gets carried out the underside.
