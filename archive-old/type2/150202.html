&gt; 	In any case, no love on the battery light still.  I have checked the
&gt; battery light and it's ok.  

I missed the initial problem report. It never comes on, or it never goes
off?

If ot never comes on and you know the bulb is good then check the wire from
the bulb back to the fuse panel. You shouuld have 0V with the key off and
battery voltage with the key on.

If it neve goes off you need to check the full lenght of the blue wire back
to the alternator. That wire provides initial exciter voltage to the
alternator and reference voltage back to the light after the alternator
starts producing. 

With the blue wire disconnected at the alternator end you should see 0V
with the key off and battery voltage with the key on.

When the alternator starts producing it sends 13.8 volts to the key
switch/fuse panel and also puts 13.8 volts on the blue wire internally.
Light goes off because ther is no voltage differential. But, the alternator
needs at least *9* (someone verify that number) volts on the blue wire when
it starts spinning to begin generating. And I *think* that if the initial
voltage there is low it has to spin faster before it picks up the
excitation field. Once it starts generating it is &quot;self exciting&quot;,
providing its own voltage to the field.
