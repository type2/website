&gt; I find it interesting how things have changed.  Not that long ago it was
&gt; common practice to load up the back of a pickup with adults and kids and
&gt; head for the beach/picnic/etc.  These days even the suggestion that
&gt; someone might ride inside the vehicle unbelted draws comment!

Which reminds me of my earliest bus experience. It must have been around
1960 when I went to a youth camp. About a dozen kids were loaded into a
splitty which had windows but no benches in the back. A couple of potato
crates where put in the back to sit on. The driver knew this was illegal as
every time he spotted a police car we had to 'duck'.

Well, it's a good thing we now have all sorts of safety devices in our cars.
There are now fewer deaths on the road than  say 25 years ago, even with
increased traffic. But life is full of trade-offs and an older VW is
probably not the safest car on the road. But you can offset that by driving
responsibly and by keeping the speed down (which most buses will do for you
anyway).

One of the rules here is that children under 12 must ride in the back-seat.
In my experience that's dangerous when there's only one adult in the car
(the driver). I have my 7 year old mostly in the front seat (in the belts of
course) because I can see what she is doing. Having a kid behind you can be
very distracting. Such a moment of distraction caused me to hit a lamppost
when my other (now older) kids where about that same age.
