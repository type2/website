Here we go again!!
You time your engine according to the distributor you have. A 009 should
never be in a 1700, 1800, or 2.0L. There are NO 'factory timing specs' for a
009. The 5 ATDC spec is for the correct dual vacuum advance distributor with
vacuum on the retard side at idle.
Not sure what 'bible' you are looking at but your 73 is supposed to have a
021 905 205J dual vacuum distributor that times at 10 ATDC, NOT 5 ATDC.
This distributor has 21-25 degrees centrifugal advance at 3400 rpms and 7-12
degrees vac. advance and 16-18 degrees vacuum retard.
This distributor is the same as a 021 905 205N.

&gt; OK, I've got the original engine in a 73 Westy, manual transmission.
&gt;
&gt; According to the bibles, I should be timing it at 5 degrees after TDC, but
&gt; it will only work at 16 degrees before???
&gt;
&gt; The PO replaced the dual carbs with a single Weber and replace the dizzy
&gt; with a Bosch 009.
&gt;
&gt; Can these changes throw the timing out so much?
&gt;
&gt; My buddy helping me (actually doing all the work while I hand him the
tools)
&gt; thinks maybe the distributor was not installed properly or maybe the
timing
&gt; pulley was not installed properly.  I'm pulling my hair out, and there
ain't
&gt; that much left.
