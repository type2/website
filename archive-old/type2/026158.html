Some of you may remember that I had a problem with my heater.  I had
established that it was a flow problem rather than a temperature problem, so
yesterday I resolved to track it down before the weather gets properly cold.
With the aux blower on and flaps fully open, I proceeded to check for leaks,
starting at the back of the bus (not easy when you're outside and the wind
is blowing a lot).  The only leak that was noticeable was from the front of
one of the heat exchangers where it has been badly made and there is not
enough metal to seal with the riser tube.  I will have to patch this with
some sort of high-temp tape.  The flaps were indeed pulled fully open and I
could not feel any air escaping from the control boxes.
So - proceed to the front of the bus and take off the pan under the cab
floor.  Undo the cardboard hose from the duct that goes up to the dash, feel
the end - diddly squat.  Shuffle further back, undo the other end of the
hose, feel the end of the main (fixed) tube... gale force 9.  Eureka, the
blockage is in this cardboard thing.  I felt inside the hose and found that
it was all mangled up on the inside, presumably from flapping about in the
breeze (it was disconnected when I bought the bus).  After clearing out as
much of the loose paper, foil and insulation as I could, I put it all back
together and went for a test drive.
After about 5-10 minutes of driving in shirt sleeves, I had to turn the heat
off, it was too much.  The air flow from the dash vents was incredible, you
should have seen the amount of dust and dead flies I had to clear up
afterwards.  And this is without insulating the hose as per Mr. Bulley's
recommendations.  This is a completely stock system with aftermarket heat
exchangers and it's just as good as a water cooled car.  Can't wait till I
have to defrost the windscreen.
