Hiya Todd,

I've been following this thread along as something of a lurker.  But I 
thought I'd add my thoughts.  I'm glad you found the zinc-chromate primer.  
VW used this stuff in the primer process before painting in original 
construction.
Corroless is a product handled by the Eastwood Company 
(www.eastwoodcompany_dot_com).  They claim that it stops rust by (in part) laying 
down a protective layer of glass leaves and sealing the rust in.  Lots of 
folks swear by this stuff.
Frankly, I'm kinda surprised that nobody (maybe I missed a posting) has 
mentioned POR-15.  Insofar as I am concerned this stuff is the definitive 
answer to rust.  It encapsulates rust in a plastic non-permeable envelope.  
Those who have used it are quickly convinced that this product is THE answer 
to rust.  I'd urge you to visit the Restomotive website at www.por15_dot_com  
By the way, the rest of the chemicals made by Restomotive are equally 
impressive.

Keep 'em rolling

Mike
