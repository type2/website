Subject: [T2] Adventure Camper

Greetings all. New to this list, but not to dubs. My question stems from my
one and only baywindow. It is a 1973 Adventure high roof camper. Anyone else
have/heard of these? My interior is in pieces and I would love to find pics
of one to see how it is supposed to be. Was it originally equipped with an
electric refrigerator like mine has now?  TIA!
