I would not consider the oil temps to be extremely high. You should expect a
temp of around 200 degrees most of the time. If your oil never got over 150
degrees, it would be too thick for good lubrication, unless you are
running straight 20 wt or something.

Nope, I'm running straight 30wt.  Pretty thick stuff when cold, but seems to
be the best all round bet for the bus..

I do think that 260 is too high on the highway.

Yes indeed.

If the engine heats up dramatically on the highway, but
cools rapidly at idle, you may have a problem with lean
running (plugged or dirty main circuit in carb,
bad fuel pump, vacuum leak) or too much advance
(dist timed to only 30 degrees at 3000 RPM?)
or too high a compression (who built the engine?
Did they supply you with a compression ratio?)

Well, initially, I thought the mixture was lean.  I have since had a co2
test done and the gases seemed to be fine.  There is no backfiring, and the
temps don't seems to vary at all regardless of how lean or rich I've made
the mixture.  I haven't checked the timing recently, but it was set about 4
months ago at 25 deg at 3000, a bit low, should be about 30, I just haven't
gotten around to fixing it...  The engine was rebuilt before I purchased the
engine and had about 120-125 psi all around.  Seemed ok.  I have no idea of
the compression ratio.


If there is oil all over the engine, that may be causing
the heating, oily engines are well insulated by the dirt.
But, I would find the source of the leak first.

No, the engine is clean, but there has recently been a film of oil over the
engine...I'm pretty meticulous about keeping all dirt/oil off the engine,
especially the cooling fins...

If the engine cools off quickly at idle, your
cooler is fine. It is obviously cooling the oil at
10-15 PSI, why not at 35+ PSI at highway speed?

What is considered cooling off quickly.. When I'm at 250 on the highway and
slow down to around town driving, it probably takes 20 minutes (very rough
estimate) to cool back down to 210 or so...It never really will drop back
down to 180 unless it sits and gets that cool.

Have you done a hot compression test?

No.  What would that show?

Do you get any backfires or gurgling noises
when decelerating in gear? (Lean mixture)

Nope.

Are you sure that a paper towl, rag or plastic
shopping bag didnt get sucked into the fan?

Pretty sure..  That would be quite a stretch...But I'll never rule anything
out until I check it...I'm going to pull the engine at some point to have a
look at this, but I'd like to know the possible causes for such high oil
temps at highway speeds...

Good luck.
