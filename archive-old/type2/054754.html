Andy,
I have two GOOD functional boxes,  * for $110.00 ea. that is including
shipping to Miami* Both out of 71 buses. Either one is better than those
rebuilt aftermarket ( Grey painted) Mexican ones that they want $285.00 for,
that have had the output shafts shot penned to hold them together. AMHIK
P-mail me, Andy,  I can ship you one today if you like.

Bob

71 Westy- The Free Bus

&gt; Im going to need a steering box for my 68. 68-72 is the same I think.
&gt; Anyway if youve seen the cost of a rebuilt you know why Im looking. Id
&gt; really like to find a used one in functional shape. Im kind of pissed at
&gt; myself for not saving the bad box from the 69 that I gave away, I would
&gt; have liked to take a crack at it anyhoo.
&gt; Oh well.
&gt; TIA.
