Thanks for all your help. It is working. Turns out
I had a blown fuse. The problem was that I could'nt find the fuse but
Thanks to Karl..I found it. It does leak a little but no to bad. I can
just put a towel under it and it'll be good enough. I guess I could
get some seal and seal it. Can any recommend a good brand?

Thanks
