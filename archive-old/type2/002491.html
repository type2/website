Hello All. I'm a new subscriber to this list so I wanted to introduce
myself. I'm Meredith Murray and my wife is Debbie. I am currently on the
vintage bus list because I have a 64 Single cab and a 63 DLX hardtop.
The reason for my visit to this list is to gather information on a 1972
westy that I might be able to acquire. I haven't talked to the owners yet,
but someone who was looking at it said the only thing wrong with it was the
engine. I know I have heard of a bastard engine around this time, which year
was it and what was the problem?
The bus is in good shape just looking at it on the surface. It is a hard top
westy with a walk thru seat. It still even has the child cot, and all of the
interior parts.
The guy that was looking at it said the owners wanted $500.00 for it. Is
this a fair price for that year bus with a bad motor? Also could someone
give me an idea on the price of a complete brake job, thetas parts only
because I can do the job myself. Also what does a Tranny go for for that
year in case this one is bad?
I know I will need cosmetics on the outside, but the inside is in great
shape!
Any other advice on things to look out for or be aware of? Thanks for any
advice someone could give, because it might be time for my first non split
bus.
Thanks again.
