Subject: Riviera Water Systems/Pre-Drilled Sump Plates

Howdy All --
This is a 2-question inquiry about two different subjects, as my search
efforts have not been very fruitful.  Here goes:

1) Past/Present Riviera Owners:  I'm a fairly new owner of a 79 Riv and
need to get my internal water system going, but it didn't come w/ any
instruction manuals to refer to.  I want to first clean, sanitize, and
flush the water tank (as it says to do on the side of the vehicle) but I am
not sure how.  Is it possible to remove the tank and do it that way, or is
it just a matter of running soap &amp; water thru the tank and out the drain
via the hoses and such?  What should I use as a cleaner and sanitizer? 
Anything else I need to know?  (Of course, if anyone knows where I can get
ahold of some original instruction manuals for this beast, I would be very
interested in that as well!)  Thank you for whatever info you can
provide...

2) I would like to acquire a pre-drilled sump plate for installing a VDO
oil temperature gauge sender.  I know that Bus Boys sells them -- does
anyone know of any other parts suppliers (or others) that sell them? 
Thanks!

I appreciate that you took the time to read this.
