Subject: Re: [T2] Fuel Injection Woes.....

[...]

&gt; When I take my foot off of the gas pedal, or even just let up a little, the
engine just shuts off. Stop and go has just become stop and get frustrated,
then restart. It doesn't always start right away after dying either. I only
have start problems immediately after it dies on the road, never any other
time. Sometimes I can keep it alive by throwing it in neutral and giving it
gas throughout the stop, then throw it back in first when its time to go, but
this is no way to drive and it only works half of the time anyways. This was
the same thing that the bus was doing before I replaced the AFM. There is also
resistance/hesitation at around 40mph and it won't go over 60.

Do you have a good voltmeter handy? If yes, do this test and let me know what
happens.

Set it on dc volts and connect positive to + on the coil. Negative to the bolt
holding the coil on the housing. At idle, read voltage. Watch the voltmeter
and have someone turn on the headlights.
Does the voltage go from around 13.5 to below 12?
