Subject: Shifter pops out

My shifter has lunged out of place a couple of times now when going into 
fourth... I have to man-handle it to get it back in, but it really scares 
me... I dont like to break down for anything... BTW, I have a 78 Westy with 
a 2 litre andf a stock tranny...

My question is, is that the fault of the shift rod coupler??? What would 
make it come loose like that?? I feel like I could replace the coupler 
myself, but would like some advise as to what else to check into...
Thank you in advance....
Aaron
