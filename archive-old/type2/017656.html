&gt; Hello Volks,
&gt; 
&gt; In the process of installing all the old stuff on a new AVP long block
&gt; engine for my 1978 Westy I came across puzzle.
&gt; 
&gt; On the right top side of the bell housing is an item I can not identify.
&gt; It is disc-shaped on the flywheel side and extends through the casting
&gt; into the motor compartment where it has a rubber cover with a wire
&gt; extending through it.  This wire goes to the rear of the motor where it
&gt; connects to nothing.
&gt; 
&gt; Questions:
&gt; 1. What is it?
&gt; 2. What does it do?  Hall effect pickup?  For what? Engine diagnostics?
&gt; 3. How do I get it out? Should I just chuck it?
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks and more questions are sure to follow.
&gt; 
&gt; Drew
