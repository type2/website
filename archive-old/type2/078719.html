&gt; I'm the owner of a 1978 Westy camper bus that seems to
&gt; be stalling out and leaking lots of oil. She's been
&gt; sitting for a while, but it's time to get her running
&gt; and back into service.
&gt; 
&gt; Is there any way to get this thing in purring order so
&gt; it can get to Michigan and back for less than $1000?
