I finally got the pushrod tubes in and now it's the rocker arms.  I
backed off all the adjusting screws, however it seems that some valves
are being opened no matter how bar you back them off.   This makes sense
to me, as I don't expect enough adjustment that even a fully opened valve
could be closed by backing off the adjuster - it's just that none of the
manuals mention it leaving me second guessing myself (again)    Can
someone just confirm if this is normal? - Thanks  ( I made sure all the
pushrods were seated)
