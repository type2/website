&gt;&gt; I went to my FLAPS and I was flabbergasted when they told me, &quot;We don't
&gt;&gt; carry a battery for a 76 Transporter, nor do I even have a listing for
&gt;it.&quot;
&gt;

Group 41 batteries are available at any Interstate dealer, nationwide. This
is the one of the proper lenght, width and height and has the posts
oriented correctly for stock installation. Most battery catalgs have a
listing in the back for antique vehicles, anything over 15 years old. You
need to find a more knowledgeable parts house.
