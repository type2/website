&gt;I would suggest taking a look at your cablle up near the pedal assembly,
&gt;and seeing if it is frayed, and about to break the rest of the way.:)

I agree - this definitely sounds like a frayed cable, about to break!
I had the same problem once - it was frayed in the middle though, so no
visual clues (just the continual adjusting required). I actually had to
snap/cut the cable, and with draw the 2 pieces from either end.
