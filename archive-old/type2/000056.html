I had the pleasure to be part of the relay this week. Picked it up in Johnson 
City, TN on Wed and delivered it last night at Chucky's VW Redneck Camp in 
Cosby TN.

Was a beautiful drive through the country for the weekend. All in all about 
260 miles for the round trip for the baton pick up and delivery.

Many bus sightings on the trip. 68/ 70 blue deluxe on 32. Same year white 
camper in Johnson City. Splitty single cab with motor cycles in the back In 
Johnson City. Vanagon camper in Newport.

It was a great experience for me and the kids.

Check it out.
