Subject: turn signal switch 4 sale

     On the '63 single cab we just bought the turn signal switch is the 
     older 3-wire type for semiphores.  I have acquired a 6 wire to replace 
     it.  Anyone want the 3 wire?  It is white and in like-new condition. I 
     need cab inerior panels in good shape, driver's exterior door handle 
     (pull type) and metal (chrome?) covers for the two cargo space doors 
     and engine door.  trades?
