Subject: RE: Fuel pump noise fixed!

&gt;I suppose it must have been running a little lean during the time 
&gt;the pump was whining and via the butt dyno it does appear to be 
&gt;slightly peppier, 

Do you have any schematics, drawings, or pictures of your dyno?  Sounds like a 
finely-tuned, precision instrument!

Sorry - couldn't resist :)
