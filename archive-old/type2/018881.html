&gt;       Hey Type 2 owners,
&gt;   I recently purchased a 1973 Bus. It's still a work
&gt; in progress. The one thing that eludes me is, the name
&gt; for the bus. It's not a Kombi, Westy, or Camper.
&gt; Here's a brief body description: On the Driver's side
&gt; there's no panel with windows. In other words there's
&gt; no windows on that side, it's all paneled off. Every
&gt; dealer of parts and mechanics I've talked to have
&gt; never seen one of these before. And personally I've
&gt; never seen one either. If anyone knows the proper VW
&gt; name for my bus, let me know please. Thanks.
