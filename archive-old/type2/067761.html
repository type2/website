&quot;Another issue is that the '75 was fuel injected and there's a large metal
bracket on the right-hand side of the engine compartment; it was
originally used to hold the large air filter box and might be in the way
of your carbs. Of course, you could cut it off, but that's a somewhat
irreversible measure.&quot;

        Having replaced the large metal bracket that holds the air-filter
on my '70, I recomend that anyone removing such a bracket do so by
drilling out the spot-welds that were used to attach it in the first
place. Ok, real a-r but it looks better than a sawzall'ed stump
and is reversable if you want/need to. Paint the holes when you
make them and you can always just bolt it back together. I used
grade 8 bolts with air-nuts (nylon locking nuts).

        That said, its no job for a battery powered drill :) Get
a new, sharp, bit about the size of the spotweld and plenty of light.
Plus, being able to un-bolt the aircleaner bracket made it unneccesary
to drop the engine when I replaced the primary wire and its grommet.

        Cheers!
