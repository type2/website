Subject: [T2] NOT sad news, but a question


&gt; I'm going to do a search through the archives re: oil leaks, but
&gt; I have a quick question before I do. Should the oil drain plug on
&gt; a T4 motor have a washer (1977, original motor)? I noticed when
&gt; draining it for the first time yesterday that it didn't and I
&gt; thought I remembered that the T1's did.
 I have an oil leak and it

Yes when you get the &quot;oil change gasket kit&quot; a copper washer is provided for
this purpose.


&gt; looks like it's from around that plug and from the oil filter
&gt; (new filter didn't help). Note this is not the screen plate, but
&gt; the oil drain plug to the left of the screen plate. Oh, and
&gt; another question: what's that plate at the bottom of the oil
&gt; filler tube for? Looks like it's held on by 2 10mm bolts?

Sounds like the coupler for the filler tube meeting the case, dipstick also
sits in here.(makes removal of fan shroud easier)


&gt; Bentley's manual is on the way from Amazon, but my curiosity has
&gt; forced me to ask here. Sorry for the T4 newbie questions!
