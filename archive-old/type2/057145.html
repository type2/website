Subject: F: Vanagon Water-cooled best year(s)
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

Posting this for a friend who is looking for a Vanagon 'falia but
water-cooled.  I can't recall the address of the water-cooled list so I'm
asking here of those on this list who might know.  If someone can forward me
the other list address I'll post there too.

He wants to know which were the best years (mostly engine wise) for the
water-cooled vanagons?  Also, should he consider automatic or look for
manual?  Anything else in particular for the individual years?  How about
pertaining to the camping package?  Thanks.

'81 'falia
