&gt; So, I'm having some issues with my clutch cable breaking and it looks

&gt; like my bowden tube has a bit too much bend it in.  So, before I do
&gt; anything, I wanted to get some advice on how far forward/back the
&gt; engine/tranny are supposed to mounted.  I figure I can move it about an
&gt; inch or so total but I wanted to check with everyone first.

Your premise seems valid but doesn't the transmission &quot;center itself&quot; once
it is handing from it's carrier?

Everytime I install it, the dirt marks on the prongs form the nose cone end
up in the same place but only if I bolt that part last.

I just broke a cable inside the bowden tube myself so I'm wondering what's
wrong with my setup...
