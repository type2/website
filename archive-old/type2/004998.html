Subject: European NOS Parts &amp; Hoover CD on Website!
Date: Tue, 1 Dec 1998 01:27:32 -0500
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

Well, at long last, I've posted a list of many of the parts I discovered
while in Europe last month!  Some Syncro and Splittie parts have yet to be
posted, but most of the rest are there.  Included are new repair manuals for
Vanagons and Breadloafs, NOS German heat exchangers, engine tin kits,
Vanagon Euro bumper/spoiler kits, lock sets, and a lot more.  While you're
there, you can order a copy of Bob Hoover's Sermons on CD ROM as well.

I put the European parts on the Members page,
http://www.busdepot_dot_com/members.htm.  Save this URL for future reference,
because it is a &quot;hidden&quot; page.  There is no link to it from any of the pages
on the website, as it is for Listmembers only.   While these special deals
can be found as isolated items on different pages of the website, for now
only the listmembers page has them all in one place.  You will have to go to
the regular search page to order the parts, though, as explained on the
Members page.

I'm giving List Members first crack at these, but in about a week I'll
promote them to the general public. Many of the quantities are limited.
Some I may be able to get again in a couple of months, others not at all.

The parts themselves are at port in Philadelphia as I write this, awaiting
Customs clearance before I can send a truck for them.  So it should be
Friday or Monday before they ship.  Orders will be taken on a first come,
first serve basis.  If they are sold out by the time your order reaches us,
Jerry will let you know via e-mail.

Thanks,
Ron Salmon

p.s.  We've added a new confirmation feature to the website order form.  You
should receive an automated e-mail confirming your order within the same day
that you place it, followed by a personal confirmation from Jerry either the
same or next business day.  If you receive both, your order reached us; if
not, drop us an email just in case it didn't.  This may be overkill, but
you'll certainly get plenty of notice that we got your order!
