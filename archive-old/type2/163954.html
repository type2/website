Subject: Re: [T2] high octane gas

Hey guys  on a stock type1 with the CR set right you don't need high  test. 
It will get better gas mileage with high test and probably run cooler . On  a 
type 4 we have found that it helps from getting the heads too hot to run high  
test . With our customers running high test we haven't seen any dropped valve  
seats. This also applies to the vanagon with the waterboxers   later   Mark
