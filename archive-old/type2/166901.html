Subject: Re: [T2] 9 Pin Flasher Relay Questioin

Hi Jon,

I agree on the possible wiring issue, but shouldn't at least one side turn 
signal work then? Turn signals on both sides drew about ~4amps when turned on.
I had removed the fuse and placed my meter in place of the fuse. Seemed a bit 
high. Any one know what is normal or any other thoughts?

Please forward any info you might have.

Thanks again

Ray

 


 





&lt;&lt;As for your specific issue, if the light is just lighting up and not
flashing, check the front turn signal bulb holders. One of mine popped loose
and was causing the exact problem which would also explain the popped fuse
if the hot wire touched the body. A little hockey tape fixed mine in place.
&gt;&gt;
