Subject: Deadheads and engine compartment door

--part1_11e.cffca35.29bb9c6b_boundary

I bought Phigment for $300 from a kid who was 19, with the specific intent of 
taking it to Dead shows.  Unfortunately Jerry died shortly thereafter.  I 
have covered it in stickers I picked up at shows I attended in less worthy 
vehicles.  I did this because in spite of the body being in excellent shape 
it is caved in the front and back; I know it will never be a show quality 
ride so I can use it as a billboard to display my personality.  And as with 
all of my vehicles, I will take care of the mechanics lovingly but you will 
be certain to find stray garbage under the seats along with books and clothes 
strewn throughout the back and a healthy layer of dog hair covering the 
upholstery...  

Since it is no longer Friday, here is my legitimate post: how important is it 
for my engine compartment door (the outside one) to seal completely?  The PO 
was rear-ended and we have straightened it as much as possible but the door 
does not seal tight.  There is a small gap towards the bottom on each side of 
the door (replaced, so it is straight) if you push it shut far enough to 
latch.  Will this affect how it runs?
