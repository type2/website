Subject: A rebuttal to Herr Lyle/K&amp;N, L-jet tuning, etc...

What took you so long George? Jees, thought you would have been all over this 
one like a bad haircut from the get go. So let me 'splain some things to 
y'all. First off , the good Mr. Lyle is 100% completly and totally correct. 
If you want your eng. to last a good long time, Leave it Alone. Do everything 
VW said. Use stock parts. Follow the maintainance recommendations to a &quot;T&quot;. 
Drive smoothly and sedately, with the serenity of a Zen Master. And get use 
to being passed on a daily basis by pimply faced kids on mopeds. The flip 
side: So you don't much care for being the slowest thing on the road, and 
deside to do some tweaking. Wonderbar. But keep in mind the second you change 
anything, from timing to compression ratio to mixture, you're dropping your 
MTBF. There is always a sacrifice. I for one don't mind the trade off. I'll 
go 40-65k miles between failures with a bumped eng.  But it is a hell of a 
lot of fun!  I was under the assumption ( and you know what they say about 
assumptions...) that the folks out there who wanted more umpf out of their 
eng.'s knew that it always comes at a price. If that is not the case, I 
humbly stand corrected.
