 &gt; &lt;&lt;&lt;go buy a $10.00 round marine bulkhead access hatch.
 &gt; this consists of a female bulkhead plate which is installed
 &gt; on your back deck (sealed). Ready access is now available
 &gt; via the removeable (male) threaded plug which also is &quot;O&quot;
 &gt; ring sealed. These come in plastic or metal. Dont worry to much
 &gt; about motor sounds unless you are missing the firewall...

 Daniel:
 RE my previous message: 1.I know YOU know the vanagon fuel tank's in
 front but a previous message made itr sound like someone didn't know.
 2. I don't think 68's have that cover over the tank that you're
 referring to as the firewall-68's have a lot of differences from later
 years.
