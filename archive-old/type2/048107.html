Subject: Re: [T2] Re : Oil Cooler  Question

I do this too, i think of it as a preventative measure when i stop for gas or to
take a break.  Now i have an oil temp gauge but the habit lives on.  This method
also once prevented my bus from going up in an inferno.  I did the smell test
and smelled smoke got the fire extinguisher to get a small oil fire.  Its add
how one gets used to how it &quot;should&quot; smell and how you notice when it is off.
Im sure we all know the rebuild time smell by now. I think the scent can be a
good seat of the pants (seat of the nose?) check on how your engine is running
and can prevent tragedy.

&gt;    If I sniff the air in the intakes it
&gt; doesn't smell hot there either .
&gt;
&gt; .
&gt;
&gt; Seem I can tell if the engine is burning or leaking by smelling at the
&gt; intake.
&gt; Anyone notice that depending on how you are parked , the smell is stronger
&gt; on one side than the other?
&gt;
&gt; The engine intake grills are about the correct height as you walk past.(nose
&gt; level) but I don't think this was planned:)
