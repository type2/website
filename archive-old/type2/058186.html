Subject: Gene Berg e-mail address? (and IDing Berg parts)
Content-type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII

Does anyone know if Gene Berg Enterprises has an e-mail address ???

Check this one out... a while back I sent a case and several Gene Berg engine
accessories to a very reputable engine builder. I'm starting to believe that
he installed none of the Berg parts I sent him... and replaced them with sub-
standard off brand parts that are similiar. The reason I want to contact Berg
is to see where his logo or name is on various parts. I've noticed in the past
most of the parts I have purchased for the Berg company in the past has had
the name engraved or casted into the piece. I think this will be proof for the
pudding.

Do we have any big Berg part users that can help me out with ID'ing the parts
in question, maybe you have one on your engine or on the shelf and can tell me
if it is so labelled. 

Thanks in advance
