Subject: The expensive sound that wasn't or I promise to fix that leak in the 
 auto tran
Message-ID: &lt;372FBA24.DD44F880_at_mindspring_dot_com&gt;

I have been aware now for more time than I wish to admit to, that I am
desperately in need of an auto transmission oil(fluid) change and
replacement of the seals/gaskets.  Yesterday I taught a young new westy
owner how to change her own oil, amongst other basic maintenance.  I was
feeling so great, here is this 19 year old girl who is traveling cross
country in her bus, and she has spent all of her money restoring and
making this bus a happy little camper (sorry for the cheap pun). And me
whom not five years ago had never owned a vehicle over 1.5 years old,
knew nothing about how the engine worked, etc. explaining all this to
this bright eyed teen who is so grateful.  Ton's of tips, and advise,
&gt;from years of reading all your posts (thanks!). 

So later yesterday I put the bus into reverse, before moving I hear what
sounds like terrific grinding or rattling come from about where I think
the transmission would be if it sounded like that.  The leaking tranny
fluid, it must be dry and bad things are happening, so of course I drive
home the 3 blocks up hill to check it and hope it doesn't seize up.
Advise not 4 hours before &quot;if you hear noises that sound bad, they
probably are, muir calls them expensive noises, no matter what stop
immediately and figure out what they are...&quot;

I make it home OK, and decide not to take a look until today.  I run out
of cigarettes, so of course I decide to see if that noise goes away if I
put the 1/8 of a quart of trans fluid in, nope still there. Despair, no
cigs and bad expensive noise that didn't cure it self over night like it
was suppose to.

So I look under the bus a bit, expecting to see some exterior visual
clue as to the problem, perhaps a large pool of liquid vs the little
drop puddle.  Nothing unusual, then as I am crawling back out I see it! 
The muffler has come unattached from the pipe in connects into that run
&gt;from the front.  The muffler is hanging by the one strap near the
exhaust pipe, it rattles.  I push it back into it's rusted housing and
start the bus, the noise is gone!!! It was the muffler, I am saved, I
can go get cigs now (pathetic, but addicted).

Tomorrow I order the A.T. seals and do the job this weekend, I got lucky
this time.
