&gt;   Okay, so I was a little sceptical to all the response about leaving the 009's for the type 1 crowd.  Could it make that much of a difference for in city travel?  YES IT CAN!  I am truely amazed at the extra low end power and I am now making since I replaced the 009 with a 021-905-205P dizzy.
&gt; 
&gt;   This is on a duel carb (dellorto) 2.0 hyd. in a '72 westy.  With the 228mm clutch using an 091 bell housing on the 022 Tranny.  because of the tranny gears I don't have the top end you 091 guys have but I don't have a problem going up hills in 4th!

&gt;   Thanks for all the advice over the last few months......

 From where are you picking up the vacuum source?  I have a neighbor who 
just put a '79 2 liter into his 74 bus.  Despite my advise, he's using 
the Delortos (Big suckers!  Look like IDA Webers.) No x-over between the 
sides.  Unless I can find a good vacuum source it'll have to be 
mechanical advance only. Open to suggestions.

Jim
