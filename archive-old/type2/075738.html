Subject: Re: [T2] CAD files in the archive idea

The only comment I'll make about PDF:

Access Systems sends:

&gt;&gt; My concept is to just standardize on the fairly ubiquitous .pdf file for
&gt; 
&gt; pdf is not universal and it cannot be read by all computer systems

PDFs can be read, using Adobe Acrobat Reader 5.0, on Palm, PocketPC, Windows
3.1 through Windows XP, 680x0-based Macs, PowerPC Macs running systems 7.5.3
to Mac OS X, Linux, Sun Solaris (both the X86 and SPARC versions), SGI Irix,
IBM AIX, HP-UX, DEC Unix and OS/2 Warp. That's pretty much all the computers
in common use today.
 
&gt;&gt; uploads to the archive.  Anybody can download them and print them out, they
&gt;&gt; can't be changed (makes us designer types sleep better), and it's a
&gt; 
&gt; pdf can indeed be hacked,  not easy but certainly doable

It's easier than you think; if you have Adobe Illustrator 9 they open right
up. It's a touch harder if the author set the &quot;do not modify&quot; flag, but it's
still doable.
 
&gt;&gt; reasonably efficient file format.
&gt; 
&gt; open to discussion

Depends on your Distiller version. Everyone who distills PDFs needs Acrobat
5; we distilled a PostScript file in Distiller 4 and got a 22.5MB PDF, then
distilled the same PostScript file in Distiller 5 and got a 2.1MB PDF.
