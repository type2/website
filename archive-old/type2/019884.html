Hi Darrin,

What Brand of non-disposable air filter do you have?

The Type 4 Carbed version and FI both used paper elements in 1974.

If after market as in K&amp;N, clean the mesh with soapy water, air dry (not high
pressure dry) and re-oil.  K&amp;N does sell spray on cleaner and re-oil products.
Which I use.

If an upright with an oil bath air filter, Drain and clean the lower half and
brush off or scrape the crude from the upper half.  Do not over fill the lower
half with oil.  The air does not pass through the oil, the oil catches and traps
the dirt particles (heavy) when the air (light) makes a rapid direction change
just above the oil.  If the upper half is oil soaked, I have had luck rinsing it
out with a strong detergent solution.  The first time I tried to clean one out,
I used a strong solvent and destroyed most of the fiber material.

Think it was coconut hair or something.

Let me know which filter you have if you have any other questions.

Mike D.
