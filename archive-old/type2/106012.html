&gt; Possibly getting a removeable or detachable stereo would help.

This isn't a deterrent. They will steal your deck and a matching face from
another victim. Anything you secure will get damaged while they try to
remove it or they will ruin your dash trying to get it out. Ask me how I
know.

&gt; Take away the reason they want to get in and minimize the damage they
&gt; would have
&gt; to inflict if they still feel the need. You cant really stop a thief.
&gt; The damage is usually more expensive then whatever was stolen.

You can either remove the deck and put in something not worth stealing like
the factory AM radio or get inventive and put it somewhere they can't see
from outside to encourage them to break in:

You can never fully eliminate the risk.
