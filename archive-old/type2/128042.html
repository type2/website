Subject: SVDA

&gt;The main trouble I am having is getting one that
has the vacuum advance in the correct location.

For awhile, I ran a bug dual advance dizzy on a
1800 t4.  I no longer remember the specifics,
like dizzy # and such, but I do recall having to
switch the firing to get it right.  As long you
have the firing order correct and going to the
right cylinder, the engine doesn't care which way
your dizzy is oriented.  

The only concern is the slight retard built into
T1 dizzies for the #3 cylinder, designed to help
keep that cylinder from overheating.  Now you
don't need the retard on a T4 engine, and it
matters little whether it's #1 or #3 that is
retarded.

Anyway, it will work in a pinch, and still gives
better performance, mileage, and a cooler engine
than a mechanical 050 or 009.
