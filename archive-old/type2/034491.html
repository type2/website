Subject: updated dual carb web page request

here is the latest on the development on doing a stock dual carb
page.  i have had a number of good responses from knowledgeable folks
who are willing to help.  to help clarify what i am proposing, here
goes:

a page with photos of all vac. connections
including-
-advance on dizzy
-retard on dizzy (for dual vac units)
-vac port to preheat hose valve on air cleaner
-vac ports to egr valves
-vac port on balance tube between carbs

plus photos of-
-where to route or plug off the ports that come out of the heads
(afterburner system i think..)
-complete parts numbering system for all dual carb components.
-all jets, seals, floats,etc.

i see the page having one section with a complete parts breakdown,
like you see in the exploded view of the carb in the bentley or
wherever.  but INCLUDING the part #'s of all parts.  did you know you
can still order most parts direct from vw if you have the #??  forget
hassling the counter-jockey at the dealer, just give him the # and
tell him to order it.  

the second page could include all the photos of where to put all the
hose connections

third and final page, would be basic tuning.  this page i know has
pretty much already been done by others.  but it would be nice to have
as much info as possible all put together.  

when i was rebuilding the carbs last couple days ago, on the back of
the instruction sheet they listed some part #'s of items still
available from vw.  like floats, gaskets, jets.  so it got me thinking
it would be nice to put together a page and when the dual carb
questions come up, we could all point to the same direction.  i have
ZERO computer experience, KNOW NOTHING about making a page, or
programming, NOTHING.  i am merely trying to get the idea started.  

please send me responses if you think this kind of page would be
helpful.
