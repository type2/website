If Les said they can do it, I believe it. I'm a Canuck and we don't have

them up here, but when I was on vacation a few years ago, my wife and I had

driven the slab down into Oregon in our Plymouth Horizon. We pulled into a

small Oregon town and went for lunch in a nice mom and pop cafe. When I came

out, I started the car and drove out of the parking lot, only to be greeted

by a lovely grinding noise from the front brakes. I got down and checked

them and it was metal on metal!!! I was some mad at myself for letting this

happen, I should have known. In any case, there was a Les Schwab in that

little town; we went there, and despite the fact that they were booked till

Doomsday, the manager said no problem after I explained we were visiting

from Canada and passing through. He rolled up his sleeves and did it

personally. Now THAT is service. Since then, I've made it a point to have

any work done when I'm in the World at Les Schwab, and the service has

continued to be excelllent. And at about 2/3 the price of up here too.

 

Just my opinion, but I&quot;m stickin' to it.
