Subject: VW Bus overhead A/C instulation manual

Hello List,

Well I bought somthing today that I couldn't pass up.
It is a reprint of the 1971 Bus A/C instulation
instructions. I found a complete A/C system in a bus
recently that I plan to buy and thought this manual
would be helpful. I know that the subject of A/C in a
bus causes some disagreements at times. It seems that
most people that have actually delt with them in the
past don't like them and those that have never even
seen an A/C system in a bus want one. Any how...

Isn't there a websight that has a library of VW
manuals? I know that I have come across one somewhere.
Is it illegal to post one of these manuals online??? I
just thought that this information may be of some
value to others and I would like to share it.

Thanks in advance!!!

David Kelly
