Subject: Re: value of 36hp engine?

Actually your engine is not one of the last 36hp engines built...the engine 
soldiered on in the 113 bug until July 1960 and in the 111 (standard beetle) 
until 1963.

Its probably not worth more than $100 or so for parts....unless its been 
running and recently rebuilt with new parts, there isn't much value to it. 
36 hp parts are still fairly easy to come by. What may be valuable is the 
case....36 hp cases have a problem with the bearing seats being pounded out 
of shape, and unfortunately 36 hp cases can't be line bored...
