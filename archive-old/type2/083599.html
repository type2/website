Subject: Re: [T2] Acceptable speeds

Acceptable speeds are a tradeoff.  I don't like to fix things, so I limit
cruising speed to 58-60 in my '71.  I'll push it to 63 for short periods
if I have to for safety.

Climbing hills, I try to keep it in a gear where it is spinning healthily
(not lugging, not screaming) at partial throttle.  I try not to climb at
WOT.

I have no non-stock guages.

&gt; Since there are no gauges (tachometer or temp) in my bus that help me
&gt; determine how hard my engine is working, I was wondering if you guys have
&gt; any suggestions on roughly how hard is too hard to push my bus.  I'm driving
&gt; a 71 Westy that supposedly has a recently rebuilt 1600cc engine in it
&gt; (although I wonder about the craftsmanship involved considering my engine
&gt; just fell out due to a previously cracked engine mount that finally just
&gt; sheared off completely).  Any rough ideas would help, like for instance &quot;on
&gt; a straight away, 70 mph is probably an upper bound&quot;, or &quot;when climbing a
&gt; hill in 2nd gear, I don't usually push it above 25 mph&quot;, etc.
&gt;
&gt; I'm probably going to try and install some aftermarket gauges, especially an
&gt; oil temperature gauge, but for the time being, I'd like to be able to feel a
&gt; little bit more confident that I'm not unknowingly abusing my engine.
