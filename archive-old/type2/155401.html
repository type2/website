Hello Tony, the tricks I learned for soldering batteries in my electric
model airplane days as recommended by the pros: First, use a really
large soldering iron. You don't want to wait for the heat to penetrate
the battery, so the pencil and gun types won't work. Second, prep the
joint by tinning the tabs you will be using and lightly sanding the
battery in the area to be soldered. Apply some rosin to the sanded spot,
you are using rosin core solder? Acid core is for plumbing and will
cause problems if used in an electronic application. Third, line
everything up, build a jig to hold the batteries, or get a third hand,
and do it quick!  The wee bit of extra solder on the pre-tinned tabs
will let you know when it melts by moving slightly. Hobby supply stores
or Radio Shack should sell tabs designed for this. Hope this helps, Timo
