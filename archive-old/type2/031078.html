&gt; I guess I will have to lay the cables alongside the cable tubes and hose
&gt; clamp them on. Has anybody had any luck with this? or have any ideas for
&gt; removing the cables?

by a roll of bike shifter cable and sheath from local bike shop.  buy
bag of ends and crimp, make cables custom and lay em anywhere,  work
better the ones VW put in anyway
