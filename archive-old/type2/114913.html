Subject: mongolian circus contortionist

Is it possible to access &amp; replace the fuel sending unit this way too?
Or does it require a motor drop &amp; gas tank removal as specified in the
Haynes manual?
My sending unit doesn't work &amp; I just use mileage.    I was waiting till I
have to drop the motor for some work... but as luck would have it, she's
running strong. ;0)
78 Westy stock FI &amp;  automatic.

Thanks
-Brian
