To All:

I'm home.

7,624 miles, 197.1 engine hours, 31 days after leaving Vista for Inuvik.

Nice trip.

I wasn't able to hit the 'net during the trip and have spent the last two
days dealing with an overflowing mailbox.  I should have  the trip log edited
and ready for upload in a few days,  which will bore you all to tears with
tales of mosquitos the size of buzzards and other things Sgt. Preston of the
Yukon forgot to mention.

Nice to be home.
