Subject: Engine Compartment Seal

Hey everyone, thanks for all who replied with instructions on how to
install the engine compartment seal - I can'e believe I did it!  I am
slowly learning how to work on my Bus and you guys on the List have been
a big help.  My husband did give me a hand, but basically I DID IT! 
Next I am going to try to put a new belt on my a/c, but my mech said
that it is possible the compressor is seizing up and that is why the
belt broke off in the first place.  How would I know if this is what is
happening?  On that same note, I had said my VW garage owner had died
and I was frantic for someone to work on my bus (as I am not too
qualified yet!) but it turns out the mechanic from the garage is going
to open his own shop nearby and he has said he will still help me out,
so all is well.  Thanks again!  Beth with the '78 Hippychickmobile in NJ
