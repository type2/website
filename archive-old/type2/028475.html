Yeah, i stretched and tightened and would be able to close the gap and then
after a while, she'd open up again.
Maybe because mine was in backwards.

&gt; Make sure that when you install the seal that the seam ends up at the rear

&gt;
&gt; Porbably obvious for most, but for whatever reason i installed mine so
that
&gt; the seal was donw under the cooling fan. You can never get the ends to
meet,
&gt; so there's always a little gap - best that the gap not be directly under
the
&gt; fan, where it will suck in hot exhaust/heated air.

I've got about a 2&quot; gap in my '79.  I thought it might be prudent to fill
that
with something, as well as plug a few
smaller openings I can see when looking down thru the hatch.  Good idea or
overkill?
