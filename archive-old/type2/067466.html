Subject: &quot;Thanks!&quot; and &quot;Why I got my Bus&quot;

Hello again.
Firstly, let me say thanks to all of you who answered my last set of queries.
Now, I can get on with the resto with a network of help - Cheers!
Secondly - Why I got my Bus,
here in the UK, there is a holiday resort called &quot;Blackpool&quot; which nearly
every UK citizen has visited at one stage or another. Blackpool is a unique
place, with unique people (mostly holidaymakers), unique sea water (mud) and
unique transportation methods - the infamous &quot;Blackpool Tram&quot;. Many of my
childhood holidays were spent  in Blackpool and I loved to just sit and watch
those Trams - many of which had a split front window, curved front, two tone
paint work and a flat roof from which grew the pantograph connecting it to
the electric cables that ran overhead. It was when I saw my first splitty
that I realised this where the design inspiration for the Trams must have
come from .In fact, they are so alike I compare photos of trams to photos of
splitties and can't come up with many visual differences except of course,
size - a Tram can carry up to 40 (or more for a double decker). A double
decker Split-Screen Van ? Now there's an idea...............
If ever you get to see a picture of a split screen Tram (they still run in
Blackpool after 100 years!) then maybe you can see the similarity.
Anybody agree ?
