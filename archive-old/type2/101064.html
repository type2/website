Subject: Re: [T2] Starter woes

David,

Oh man, what a story....don't know whether to laugh or cry over it.

Bottom line...the ones I got still work great, but who knows when they 
will go.....after all of these posts, I expect all of them will probably 
die next week at the same time...LOL

This type of thing is exactaly why I like to fix stuff myself.  If I 
had the means to rebuild my own alternator/starters with easily obtainable 
replacement bearings and such i would do it....unfortunately, I am in what 
is still consider the parts never-never land(population less than 60,000).

Reminds me of the time when I used fix floppy disk drives at $40/hr in 
labor.  Now they cost $12.00 new.  

Obviously, it is a labor problem and a &quot;who&quot; problem.  The old guys
actually &quot;look&quot; at what they are doing and the $8.00 laborers could care 
less cause they don't feel good, or are stoned, or are semi-drunk....they 
are just there to do a &quot;job&quot; instead of really &quot;looking&quot; at what they are 
doing.  *They* aren't going to be out in the middle of the desert when the
alternator bearing die, so they don't really care.

Lot's of people do work like that these days.  That's why I like Vw's...I 
can *really* do the work on them myself and then *know* what to watch for.

Sorry sate of affairs.&lt;sigh&gt;

&gt; Okay I need to vent about this.  WHY CAN'T ANYONE REBUILD ALTERNATORS
&gt; CORRECTLY???  Except Bosch maybe?  I have never had alternator problems until
&gt; a few years ago when I was living in Las Vegas.  The original alternator in my

&lt;snipped for brevity&gt;


&gt; So what is the alternative?  How does a person get a reliable alternator?  New
&gt; from the dealer?  I had never considered that but I may call them.  Even at
&gt; $400 it might be worth it at this point, for a car I'm going to keep.  Maybe
&gt; get a late-model factory alternator from a wrecker?  Low mileage?  Would
&gt; probably last longer than one of the crappy rebuilts.  Anyone solved this
&gt; problem?  Any sources for QUALITY rebuilt alternators I'm not aware of?
&gt; 
&gt; I wonder if I can adapt a Bosch bus alternator to my Mustang?
