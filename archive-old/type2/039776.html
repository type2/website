Hi, Volks:

I would direct those searching for an Armor All substitute
to take a look at the product &quot;303&quot; Aerospace Protectant.
Their product literature (available online; search on &quot;303&quot;)
indicates the product solves the problems Armor All creates.

I've used the product for a couple years now and am happy
with the results. &quot;303&quot; is more expensive than Armor All,
but its effects are longer lasting.
