Subject: Re: [T2] Craftsman tools

SEARS owns K-Mart.

Well, the shareholders of SEARS stock own K-Mart, more properly stated.

We were in K-Mart this week for crayons, and they had all these  
Craftsmen tool chest/sets on closeout, and my wife wondered what was up.

I reminded her of the sale a few years back.
