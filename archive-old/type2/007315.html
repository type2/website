Hi All,

I have seen polished empi 5 spokes to fit bay windows advertised in Euro VW
mags and I was wondering if they're available in the States.

Can anybody tell me who to contact regarding these wheels and approx. what
they're worth over there.

I'd prefer to import them here to New Zealand from the States as the
exchange rate is better than to England.

Cheers
Ant.
