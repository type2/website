Subject: brake light failure

Hi,
A friend of the list had a question about this brake lights.
the brake lights in the 1981 Vanagon stopped working about a month ago. I'm
thinking the brake light switch on the master cylinder might need
replacement. But I'm wondering whether it couldn't be something
simple......like a lightbulb. The brake failure warning light on the
dashboard is also out. So something is happening the brake light circuit.
There are two switches on the master cylinder, the brake light switch and
the brake failure warning light switch. the green haynes for the air cooled
vanagon isn't real helpful, the guy was asleep that day and didn't remember
to put in the procedure for diagnosing brake light failure.
Anyone have any ideas on troubleshooting brake light failure? I checked the
archives and it seemed to indicate that you need to remove the dash and
replace both switches and the dash bulb. Any other ideas short of that?

Thanks,
Chris
