Subject: Re: [T2] NEW ENGINE

the clearancing required was really minimal the counterweighted crank 
required the most, maybe the amount equal to a pencil eraser, really just 
three little corners (pictures in this mo. hotvw's shows just about the same 
amount we removed. the oil pump holes were off by almost the exact same 
amount in a new stock he has there. we found no problem with the dizzy drive 
area.


&gt;
&gt; &gt; Who manufactures these aluminum cases?

&gt;They are made in Brazil.    They did say that there are some
&gt;issues of clearancing, matching the oil pump holes, and fixing the
&gt;distributor drive machining.  need a competent builder (ala RIMCO) to 
&gt;detail the castings
