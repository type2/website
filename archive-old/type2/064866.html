Subject: Re: 82 stranded 20 miles out/// Tag A Long Tours, Moab, UT

 
&gt; PS: A while back some one asked about a tour company in Moab Utah
&gt; who used to use  23 window buses in Moab for tours of red rock
&gt; country.  I think the company is called Tag A long Tours.  From what I
&gt; know I think the guy has retired all of the buses and now uses 4WD
&gt; truck and jeeps.  I think he may still have them sitting around. (This could
&gt; be a rumor or there could be some good parts or restos) Anyway, from
&gt; the Moab phone book.

If it's the place I'm thinking about, they (now?) use Toyota FJ-60s. Rows
and rows and rows and rows of them.
