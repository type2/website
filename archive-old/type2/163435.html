Subject: Re: [T2] brazilian type-4 fuel pumps??

All I've heard is &quot;here-say&quot; about Brazilian made 72-74 Type 2 Fuel Pumps.
Nothing really solid info, although they were available out of Brazil many,
many years ago.  They were OK, no problems really.  But none of the major
importer warehouses carry them anymore.  A quick Google shows that there
maybe ones being made in China now.  But I'd be surprised if they're ever
available again, given that they were utilized for only 3 years in the USA
market.

Here's a longshot -  Airtex, a US OE &amp; Aftermarket manufacturer and
distributor of Fuel System Products and Water Pumps.  For many years I
carried and sold their replacement 36HP and the 72-74 Type 2 Fuel Pumps
because....well, you just couldn't find the originals.  At the time, both
were US made, great quality and reasonably priced - they're probably
produced in a 3rd world country now.  Thing is, trying to find a FLAPS that
carries or can order Airtex.  Airtex # is 1442.
