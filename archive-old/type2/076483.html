&gt;&gt; This is a typical fuel injection problem that is repaired best by folowing
&gt;&gt; the Bentley procedures. The answer may be fuel supply ( plugged filter, rust in tank )
&gt;&gt; which will display incorrect fuel pressure or delivery.
&gt;&gt; It can also be an ECU input signal ( from AFM, Temp Sensor 2, etc.)
&gt;&gt; You may guess and get lucky, but the Bentley is the preferred method.

&gt;Well, I actually *think* I have it diagnosed. The ECU, AFM and Temp 2 all
&gt;got replaced as well as the cold start. Looking through the bill (and god,
&gt;i'm gonna kick someone tomorrow) the FUEL LINES AND FUEL FILTER were NOT
&gt;replaced. Logic kinda dictates that when you replace a gas tank because it
&gt;sat for 5 years you replace the lines and filter, doesn't it? Or maybe I'm
&gt;just being a meanie.
&gt;
&gt;So, yeah, I'm like 99% sure that it's a fuel line issue since now that
&gt;I've driven it a bit more I've noticed it doing the hesitation/lurching
&gt;other than the times I've previously indicated.

Elizabeth, your first post states that fuel lines were replaced.
You are correct that there should be a new filter.
( Have them cut the old filter open for an exam while you watch ).
If the filter gets plugged, the pump will become noisy when the
stalling problem occurs, this can be verified by connecting a fuel
pressure gauge into the fuel line removed from the cold start valve.
This should produce 35 +/- 3 psi.
Next, Fuel delivery is verified by pumping fuel into a container,
exactly 30 seconds should deliver 500 cc ( 1/2 quart ).
( Open the hose right after the pump, with ignition disabled. )
There may be adequate pressure at idle, and less when the rpm
increases, and this will look like a faulty fuel pressure regulator
when it isn't, it's simply inadequate supply from blockage.
Be sure they installed F.I.hose in the pressure side fuel lines,
insofar as regular fuel line does not support F.I. pressures.
Check for grommets where the fuel hose comes thru the engine tin.
The quick fix ( adequate but not deluxe ) is a slit hose and clamp.
