Subject: Belated and brief trip report

In case anoyone was still wondering, we did make it back from our 
Atlanta-New England-Atlanta trip last month.  Everything went according to
schedule and our '72 Bus performed very well.  We logged 3035 miles in 17
days and averaged 13.5 mpg.  We had a minor brake problem and the muffler
fell apart, but neither problem sidelined us.

I am working on a full trip report, but it may take me another week to dig
through all the notes I took on the trip to complete it.  We did have a
bunch of bus sightings on the trip which will be included in the report.
