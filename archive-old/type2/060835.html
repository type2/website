Subject: Insurance

&gt; [3] I have a nomenclature/insurance question: My insurance company
&gt; insists on calling my 1970 a &quot;vanagon.&quot;  I doublechecked at vanagon_dot_com:
&gt; that designation is off by about ten years, isn't it?  What I want to
&gt; know is:

--&gt;  The insurance company covering mine says it's a &quot;1975 VOLKSWAGEN
BEETLE VAN&quot;.

   &quot;I'd like to make the midterm [exam] essay, but I've read essays
    written by engineers and it's not pretty.&quot;  -- J. Sutherland, ME464
