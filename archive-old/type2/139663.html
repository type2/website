&gt; I am now suspecting it's my 28 PICT carb doing this? I cannot figure out
&gt; anything else that could be the culprit? Would appreciate any help on this,
&gt; I'm getting stumped. Timing, dwell, vacuum advance, and all electrical
&gt; appears fine.

I'd:
	- recheck the plugs for fouling

	- make sure that your choke is disengaging when warmed up
	
	- check for vacuum leaks (is the idle completely smooth?) 
		(spray the throttle shaft bushing in particular)
	
Could also be your pre-heater tubes are clogged, but I would think that 
would result more in the choke not disengaging (although I could be 
wrong).
