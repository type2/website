It's really not that bad.  I've done the helicoil and also tapped and
installed 10mm stepped studs with the engine in the bus.  It would be
easier with the head on the workbench, but compared to removing the gas
tank or replacing the brake booster I'd say it was almost trivial.

BTW, Easy-Outs are more trouble than they are worth.  If the stud is
busted, drill it out, tap it and install a helicoil or stepped stud.  Trust
me, you won't be sorry.
