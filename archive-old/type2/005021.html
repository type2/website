Joel Wilson is coming to abuse our hospitality the Thursday night of the
Ratdog show in Asheville. (8^) He wants to leave during the day on Friday to
carabus to the event. So far, we have confirmed 4 busses for the trip.
Anyone else interested, let us know so that we might warn the neighbors.

No time table has yet been assigned.
