&gt; However what you can now get is a dinky little two pin plug and socket which
&gt; is easy to install anywhere. I've got a couple, one up in the elevating roof
&gt; for a portable fluorescent tube on a 6 foot cable, and one the front of the
&gt; master cylinder compartment for charging my phone. For that you can get 
a
&gt; cigarette lighter socket  with a trailing cable about 6 inches long and a 2
&gt; pin plug on. You plug a standard charger cable from the phone into the cig
&gt; socket which goes to the 2 pin, and can keep it handily under the seat.

The ARRL (the US national ham radio organization) has a 12V connector that
they have standardized for use with emergency radios, so that everyone's
radios would work with everyone's power sources.

The connector is a very inexpensive Molex 2-pin plastic plug and socket.
It can be found at your local Radio Shack as part number 274-222.  The
connector is designed to be used as either in-line or panel mount.  It is
very easy to wire, needing only a soldering iron to solder the pins to the
wires before pushing them into the plastic connector.  The current
capacity is advertised as 8 amps, but I've used them at 10A with no
problems.

If you wish to panel mount it, all you need is a small rectangular hole
and the connector snaps into place.  A little sheet-metal bracket would
hide these connectors under the dash for a no-holes installation.

To wire this connector, remember that the smaller part is attached to the
power _source_ and the larger part (that fits over the smaller) is
attached to the power-using device.  The female pins go into the source
socket and the male pins into the power using device.  The positive lead
goes to the pointy end of the socket.

None of the above wiring instructions come with the connector, but it is
recommended to follow them to keep everyone compatible.

I find these connectors to be useful for all my 12V accessories (radios,
GPS, lights, etc.). Much
more compact and much better connections than those stupid
cigarette-lighter plugs
