Subject: Re: Converting Bread Loaf Hardtop to Pop Top

it be possible to take a hardtop bus to a convertor and have them cut open
the roof and install a
Westy (or other) poptop?  This might be cheaper (?) and allow me to complete
the interior to my specs, not Westfalias.  BUT, I would not want to
compromise the bus's structural strength or performance. Hope this isn't
blasphemy, but some of the Westy features are must-haves (e.g. pop-top for
standing room, upper/lower berths) and others aren't (e.g. indoor stove and
sink).  Comments supporting or diagreeing with this idea are welcome.&quot;

Don't know about installing your own pop top (let me know how it works out
though), but as per the sink:  I have a Vanagon Westfalia and personally I
like having the sink very much, but don't find it absolutely necessary.  I
have a 5 gallon solar shower (cost $20) that I keep on the roof in the
forward storage area of the pop top, and I put a longer hose on it so I can
run it through the side window.  Voila, hot water running in my Westy.  It
drains right into the sink, or, if I didn't have a sink, a bucket.

Just a tip.
