Subject: Re: [T2] CHT drop

Martin,

Ya did good!  

Every minor detail can add up when sealing and heat proofing an aircooled 
engine.

It is the ONE thing that almost all newbies and some old timers will 
ignore when trying to get the temperatures down.

I'm betting that your results are pretty much permanent...feels good 
doesn't it!

Cheers, dave

&gt; I am one of those people who spends more time looking at their CHT 
&gt; gauge than the road! I couldn't help but notice last Saturday that it 
&gt; was sitting at just above 300 deg on the open road when it normally 
&gt; sits at 350 deg. (This is in a 76 2l camper with weber icts). 
&gt; Hopefully this is a permanent change and not an aberration!
&gt; 
&gt; Some of the things that could have contributed are:
&gt; - putting in an Carter electric fuel pump. I suspect I was running a 
&gt; bit lean with the mechanical pump under high load

 - blocking up the hole that lets you access the alternator tensioning 
 bolt with a piece of al flashing. No doubt lots of hot air is sucked 
 in through here!

 - tightening the rear engine hatch by adjusting the catch. I noticed 
 I could see daylight past the seal so some air mixed with hot exhaust 
 from behind the bus would have been sucked in through here.




&gt; 
&gt; I'll let you know if this is a permanent change when I get out for a 
&gt; longer trip.
&gt; 
&gt; Cheers,
&gt; 
&gt; Martin.
