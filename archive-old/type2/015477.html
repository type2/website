&gt;Forget the convertible, my 2000 jetta for example- took it in for a bunch of

&gt;cheap plastic garbage that breaks in the first year after being used a
&gt;couple times??? What DO they carry, air filters and oil? I was told a
&gt;dealership had to have X amount of parts always on hand. Guess that aint

More wizbang with cheaper parts is a market demand. All the manufacturer
dealers have low inventories for recent cars, maintenance parts only. Go
ask your local Range Rover dealer if they have cheap plastic replacement
parts on hand for 2000 productions. Then check their backorder availability
and price. Perhaps then your opinion of VWoA with sit a notch above bottom
of the barrel.
