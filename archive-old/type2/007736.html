My 72 West now rest quietly in a barn for the coming winter (we are covered 
with snow here this morning...) 

Problem is, the barn in question seems to be quite humid. I was asking myself 
if somebody on the list would know of a product (liquid, spray etc...) that 
could be put on sprayed, smeared or whatever, on the parts subject to rust 
(brake disks, wheel drums, etc.... that would be relatively easy to take off 
springtime coming. I was thinking about the substance the comes on new tools 
(router bits, for example) that looks and feels like some kind of plastic, but 
is easy to peel when the tool is to be used.

Any suggestion???
