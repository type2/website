I thought the purpose of the check valve was to stop a engine backfire from
blowing your brake booster...  Anyone?

The purpose of this is to maintain a high vacuum in the brake booster when
the engine vacuum decreases (such as during acceleration.)

I bought one from VW a few years back.  It looked considerably different
from the original part, but worked fine.
