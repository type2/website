Subject: Re: [T2] Converting Poptop into Non-Poptop

&gt;Does anyone have any experience or suggestions regarding converting a 71 
&gt;Westy
&gt;into a non-poptop vehicle?  Basically I just need to fill in the hole in 
&gt;the
&gt;roof.

I wonder if you could make it a sunroof bus.

Does anyone know if the hole for a poptop westy is the same size as a 
sunroof bus?; if is i bet you could just get your hands on a sunroof 
assembly.
