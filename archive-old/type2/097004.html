Subject: Re: [T2] Replace OIl Cooler Seals?

Did you remove the bolt on the left end for the oil cooler support?
Did you remove the alternator support on the right side? The upper end is on a
stud and the lower connects to the heater box.
Did you unbolt the support bracket on the upper bolt of the U pipe and
crossover pipe connection?


&gt; Attempting to remove the oil cooler on my '77 with the engine still in.
&gt; I have removed all the tinwork, the fan, and the four bolts that hold
&gt; the fan housing to the engine, as well as the little flaps that are on
&gt; the top of the heat exchangers. Do I need to remove the heat exchangers
&gt; to get the fan housing off, or is there some hidden bolt I am missing.
&gt; The fan housing wobbles now, but I can't seem to get it to pull forward
&gt; enough to clear the studs so I can pull it up.
