Subject: Re: [T2] Heat: Atwood Bilge Blower?

Hi Folks,

I've been using a Detmar blower for almost 2 years now, and I'm very happy 
with it.  I mounted it under the front belly pan where the flex duct goes 
thru the frame member, and keep it in place by compression of the flex 
ducts.  I wired it from a hot lead at the fusebox and thru a stock Bus 
switch -- the dome light switch from a '71 -- to a convenient ground at one 
of the belly pan bolts.  The switch is a very simple one, and it looks 
stock.  I haven't gotten around to getting one of those little &quot;fan icon&quot; 
inserts for it, but that's a bonus item that can trick out your 
installation.  If you have a stock headlight switch, you could try the 
dimmer for the gauge illumination to control fan speed, but I think the 
little wire inside is too thin to carry the load.

After thinking about how to run ducting from the rear, I chose the front 
location for ease of installation.  In addition, I wanted the blower to blow 
air at all speeds, not just idle, so I did away with the stock blower and 
housing with flaps.  Finally, I chose the front location for the lower-temp 
hot air, so my plastic blower doesn't melt.  If you mount the blower too 
close to the heater boxes, you'll cook it in no time!

Yes, the blower is loud.  You could try isolating it with some insulation or 
rubber mounts, but 240 CFM is a lot of air, and you will never be able to 
get it silent.  Despite the noise, the fan clears off the windshield almost 
as fast as a &quot;real&quot; heater, and the power drain isn't too excessive.  I'd 
say this mod is a &quot;must have&quot; for anyplace that sees freezing temps for more 
than a week a year.

Good luck!
