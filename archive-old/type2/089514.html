Subject: Re: [T2] Pop top conversion


&gt;Have you considered an AVI/Riviera straight-up pop top?  These will work on
&gt;early bays, as they were installed on them.

This is the exact project that I will be undertaking sometime this fall or
winter with my '71.  I will be taking pictures as I go and will make them
available to the rest of the world.

-Brian
