Subject: RE: [T2] putting disks on a 68-70 PS

&gt;ps - you don't want to swap out the master cyl UNLESS you go booster route 
&gt;- the 71+ m/c will NOT fit the 70. the 70 m/c will stop the bus just fine 
&gt;with the disks...

Sounds like a pretty invloved job. How does the 70 master cylinder differ 
from the 71? How does your system compare to my system without my booster 
hooked up?

*grateful I have 71s*
