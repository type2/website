Subject: My engine install

Congrats to Nikki and her installation job.  
I installed my recent rebuild into the 70 westy last thurs. with the 
help of my wife.  It only took 3 hours...  floor jack on the engine and
a bottle jack on the transmission for raising and lowering.

My engine went in 98% complete.  No major problems.  Just fitting the 
rear support bar was a pain.  At one point the engine wouldn't slide
forward any more and for about 15 minutes I was stumped.  Then it hit
me... the clutch was pretty tight and I didn't have the strength to push
back any harder so I loosened the clutch and the engine went back to 
mate with the bell housing. YES!  One thing I noticed was that my 
front tin piece is *under* the new fire wall seal, not butting up as 
G. Lyle mentioned a couple days ago.  I'm not going to sweat it though.

I then spent a few hours working on the full flow set up.  I finally
decided to place the filter under the left side battery tray.  I routed
the hoses (1/2&quot; 300psi flame resistant) in the shortest distance 
possible.  I mounted the filter holder using a simple metal framing 
t-bracket from hardware store and four bolts through the battery tray.
it's now easy to get at and the right side up aspect makes it less 
messy.  I'm a bit concerned about debris being flung up from the tires
and will think about either mudflaps or make a shield of some kind.

I have noticed that the accel. spring on the carb doesn't snap the 
lever back like one would expect it to.  I'll put a drop of oil on the
linkage tomorrow and see what happens.  The cable is new and very well
greased.  The spring is new also.

I would have started it today but my spare battery didn't have the juice
so it's spending the night at the FLAPS getting fed.  

Tomorrow:  add the Sta-lube GL4, bleed the brakes again and wire up the
gauges.(why do I keep putting that last one off?)

Hey,  maybe Nikki and I will be running the initial break in at the same
time :-)

Now for two questions.  I need some suggestions for things that I may 
have forgotten.  All responses will be read.

Secondly,  Where are Bosch Blue Coils being made now?  I thought it was
Brazil but several months ago I picked one up and I just noticed that
it's made in Portugal.  Is this new ar old?  Better or worse?

Wish me( and Nikki) luck tomorrow.
