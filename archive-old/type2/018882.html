I finally fixed this same problem on my 72 after I smashed my finger pretty
bad while trying to open the door.  The fix:  after unsuccessfully spending a
whole day tearing the door apart and making all kinds of adjustments as per
Robert Bentley, I discovered that all the door needed was a little WD40
squirted into and around the hinge/arm.  It seems that over the past 25 or so
years, the grease in there turned to glue and was binding everything up.
With all the extra work I did, my door now works as good as new.  Now, if I
could only get my passangers to quit slamming it closed.
