Subject: Vanagon alternator replacement

I'm going to replace the 81's alternator tonight (got to have something to do
waiting for the Braves to resume play) which seems to be simple enough. I'm
wondering, however, if there is a trick to securing the fan in order to get
the nut off with a socket when transfering it from the old to the new
alternator ?

Thanks,

Weston
