&gt;Hi, I'm building a 2007cc engine for my 69 bus and was told that I
shouldn't
&gt;put heater boxes on an engine that large-something about cracking the heads
&gt;after 15k or so miles

Depends on what size valves you are using.  According to Gene Berg, you can
run as big an engine as you want with heater boxes as long as you keep stock
valve sizes (stock valve sizes are a good idea in a van anyway, since that
promotes low end torque).  However, there places selling heater boxes with
bigger pipes for large valve heads, Berg, RMMW and other vendors carry them.
Personally, I am running a 1900 with stock heater boxes and stock valves
with no problems in a '71.
