THE WHOLE SCOOP

The mexican engines that i sell are built by the VW factory in mexico useing
Brazilian cases and the rest are Mexican parts. I have sold over 38 engines
in the last 2 years with only 2 problems and i was notified by VWdeMexico of
the problem, namely defective camshafts that broke at the thrust bearing.
These engines were promply replaced by my supplier without a hitch, only the
customer had to due the labor without reimbursment, but i did supply all
necessary parts to do the change out and the defective engines were shipped
back at the suppliers expense. These engines are not the same as
Beetlemex/GEX new engines, these are built for the replacement market and in
my opinion are built better then the Beetlemex/GEX engines which are Type 1
Beetle engines built for the New Type 1 Beetles in Mexico, the ones I sell
are dished piston, low compression engine, universal case for use in Beetles
and Buses. The highest mileage 1 that i have sold is topping 40,000 miles
and the one in my bus has over 20,000 both of these without a hitch, even in
the 120 degree days we have out here. If anyone would like more info feel
free to call or p mail me.

Hi volks, 
Good point!  All too true for any engine, tranny, or other major part that 
you have to have shipped to you.  
  All new engines are nice , and if you go that way Ronnie is probably the 
best way to get that.  But remember that these engines are being built by by

assemblers in Mexico who probably are getting $.80 or less an hour so they 
may not do a good job.  Which is why we know of a few of these engines
having 
prolems, including having the cam installed 180 degrees out!  While having a

engine rebuilt by a small shop does not mean you will not have a problem
with 
it, it means you should have much less of a chance of having problems due to

good shops will inspect the parts, and take more time to assemble them 
correctly.  We have heard rumor that the new Mexican cranks are cast not 
forged.  Which unless the alloy process has hugely improved since the 1970s 
means cranks that might break more often.  Plus you can not order internal 
modifictaions to improve the engine, but have to dissassemble it, and
install 
them when you get it.  Which of course will void any warrenty you had!

PS Interestingly we have been finding a few oil passages not completely 
drilled through (Especially to the lifters.) in dual relief engines from 
Germany made in the 1970s.  During this time we understand from volks who 
bought a type 1 from the factory in the 70s most of the workers at the 
wolfburg factory were from Iran, and other third world countries.  The
german 
workers had slowly, but surely for the most part left due to wages not 
keeping up with the times which again in turn was probably due to VW
planning 
on the type 1, and it's engine out of production.  Thus quality was probably

not quite as important as in the 1950s-60s.
   From what we understand the type 1, and thusly it's engine is on the way 
to the end of production soon in Mexico now!  Quality is probably going to 
suffer again, if it is not already.   Eric&amp;Barb
