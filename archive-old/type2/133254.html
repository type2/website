&gt;      I'd love to participate in something like this, If I can get the time

&gt; great because I'm just a beginner, but well enough for painting with some
&gt; grinding and filling.  I've also got a ton of hand tools like an angle

&gt; used for camping.  This would possibly mean a facilities fee, and I don't
&gt; know if that would be cost prohibitive or not, but it's just a thought.


the only problem with that is I could see the EPA raiding us on Tue or
Wed...
