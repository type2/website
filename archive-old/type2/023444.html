Aaron,

Oregon also has a motorhome classification.  I would check with the state 
police or consult with a lawyer that handles traffic cases to get a straight 
answer.  I sure wouldn't trust a response over email that starts with &quot;I knew 
a guy..........&quot; when my driver's license may be at stake over bad advice!

You would also want to make sure if you registered it as a passenger van that 
your insurance company would still assess its value as a westfalia 
conversion. You need to find out BEFORE you subit a claim if they care how 
you register it.  If they felt you had misrepresented the vehicle when you 
bought the policy they would probably low-ball the value of the claim.
