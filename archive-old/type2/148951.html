&gt;Just wondering if the pop tops are the same on the later model westy tops? Would my 77 top be identical to the later 78 and 79's? My 77 has a step on the fiberglass top that goes all around, but I don't remember the 78 or 79 having this step. My memory seems to tell me that the 78 and 79 had a top with no step, just straight up on the sides.

My 78 bus:

I think all the 74-79 tops are the same in that way.
