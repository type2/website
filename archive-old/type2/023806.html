OK, I've had about enough of this thread. 

BUT, my two cents follows...

Ron provides a very valuable service to us all should
we need it - quality parts at good prices. Period. No
questions asked.

Face it, there are not that many
places out there that can offer what Ron does. There
are not that many e-parts places out there that support
the air cooled Type 2 community. Air cooled_dot_net,
oldvolks_dot_com, Bus-Boys_dot_com, and others, do very well in
providing us all that we need as far as e-parts places
go. This all depending on what you need or how fast you
need it.  You may be able to get better or quicker
service from your local VWFLAPS but this is not the
point.

We should be thankful and embrace all that do help us
out with &quot;older&quot; VW parts and not get into a pi$$ing
contest about it.

The perosonal issue should have never gotten this far
on the list.

just my $0.02, or, a penny for my thoughts. Someone
makes a penny profit and I want to know who. That 
hould be the REAL issue, here. :-)
