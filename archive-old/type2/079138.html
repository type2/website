Subject: pertronix

I have run pertronix for years with no
&quot;apparent&quot; problems. Easy to install IMHO.

This unit is designed to replace the points on
any vehicle that is old enough to actually be running
points. It is my understanding they sell units
for a number of different makes of cars. Not
just Vee Dubbs.
