Subject: Busted Knuckel NEED HELP!


Hey ya Volks,

I'm in such desperate need of a left side Steering Knuckle for a '71 to ? to 
replace the one I messed up on &quot;Janis&quot; trying to get the roller bearing off 
at a flaps in Spartanburg SC...

Looks like I'll not be able to make  to Paddy Wagons near Columbia but will 
show up with a tent to pick up that Steering Knuckle and have &quot;Janis&quot; ready 
for Everybus 2002 in April.

Having a heck of a time getting the tie rod off without the proper tool, 
{heat and WD 40 haven't done it!)

Man I NEED help, first time in 18 yrs she's ever had to been towed home!
Almost activated AIRS but...not a dire enough emergency.  I'm gonna hit 
those bone yards Saturday and incapacitate a bus and prey I can pull it off 
unless I get word from a list member within 150 miles of Landrum SC.

Having absolutely no experience with this area and few of the  tools 
required I sure could use some assistance.  Wine, Beer and or other means of 
showing true appreciation of help will be made available.
