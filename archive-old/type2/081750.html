Subject: EveryBus 2002 (really really long)

Hi all,
Here is my EveryBus 2002 trip report:

My long journey to EveryBus started at Oakland International Airport in
Oakland, CA on the night of April 17.  I've been out in California on
business but no way was I going to miss EveryBus.  I got on the red-eye to
Atlanta, leaving Oakland just after 10 PM on Wednesday night and arriving in
Atlanta at about 5:30 AM on April 18.

My connecting flight from Atlanta to Hartford left around 7:30 AM and got
into Hartford at around 10:30 AM.  Grabbed my bag and got a cab to home in
Springfield, MA.

I slept a little on the plane and I was feeling OK about this time.  Ready
to pack up and go to EveryBus.

When I got home I had some errands to run and then I started packing my
stuff up and carrying it downstairs to load into the Bus.  As I crossed the
parking lot to the Bus who should arrive but my lovely girlfriend Kate who
would be accompanying me to EveryBus.  This would be her first VW camping
event, our first big road trip, and the first time I've seen her since late
March when I went out to California.

We finished packing up the Bus, checked the oil, got some ice for the cooler
and some cold beverages for camping and hit the road about 3 PM.

It was hot.  It was in the low 90s at least.  Our goal for the day was to
make it as far as the DC area where we hoped to join up with Bill Monk,
Jamie McMahon and Rich Macensky who had left the New England area earlier
that morning.  Their plan was to get to Virginia and camp out Thursday
night, then finish the trip Friday.  We planned to join up with them
Thursday night wherever they decided to set up camp and then caravan in with
them on Friday morning.

We got on I-91 south and headed toward Hartford.  The Bus was running
smooth.  I was cruising at about 65 mph and the oil temp gauge was hanging
out between 110 and 120 degrees C.  This I considered reasonable given the
ambient temp and the fact that I'm running Mobil 1, so onward we cruised.

South of Hartford we picked up CT route 15 which is a nice 4-lane parkway
that parallels I-91 and I-95.  No trucks are allowed and it's a nice scenic
drive, though a bit hilly.

Toward the south end of route 15 I started to get really sleepy all of a
sudden.  We pulled over to a rest area and I grabbed a short nap and after
that I was fine.  At the rest area I gave Bill Monk a call on his cell
phone.  They were already in Virginia and still didn't know where they were
camping.  He said he would give me a call when they found a place.

Route 15 comes into I-287 in White Plains, NY.  We ran into a little bit of
traffic there but nothing too serious.  Crossed over the Tappan Zee Bridge
and then got on the Palisades Parkway south toward New York City.  Got gas
on the New York side of the parkway before it goes into New Jersey so I
wouldn't have to buy gas in New Jersey.  I don't like full service and I
REALLY don't like mandatory full service.

We continued down the parkway into New Jersey and then from there got on the
New Jersey Turnpike which we followed all the way south.  Amazingly we
didn't run into any traffic on the turnpike.  Smooth sailing all the way
down.  On the turnpike I got a call from Bill and he let me know that the
group decided to go all the way to Greensboro that night.  They were already
near the North Carolina border and had run into some weather (in which Bill
lost his wipers) so while there was a break in the weather they decided to
go for it.

So I thought for a moment of where Kate and I might camp that night, and two
words popped into my head:  STEVE DOLAN!  Steve lives in Alexandria, VA and
I used to live in his neighborhood, about a half mile away from his place.
I gave Steve a call and asked him if we could camp out outside his place.
He said yes, so that became the new plan.

Night fell while we were on the turnpike and the temperature cooled down a
bit but we were still both sticky messes from all the sweating we'd done
earlier in the day.  Bleh.

At our food stop on the turnpike, we got in the Bus and I turned the key but
nothing happened.  Damn, the sticky solenoid rears its ugly head again.  I
knew my Bus had a sticky solenoid problem, which first manifested itself
when I helped my sister move to Brooklyn last summer.  Well before EveryBus
I had ordered a new Bosch starter from Bus Depot which I had planned on
installing before the trip but I didn't get to because I was suddenly called
up to go to California.  I brought the starter with me so that I could
install it when we got to EveryBus.  So to fix this issue I grabbed my small
sledge hammer, put on my coveralls and crawled under to give the solenoid a
whack.  It started fine after that.  I do have the Bosch WR-1 relay kit but
when the solenoid is dead, even the relay won't help you.  What seemed
strange was that this was the first time during the trip I had the problem,
and it was well after dark when the weather had cooled off.  Usually I would
experience problem when it was very hot, like earlier in the day.

At the same time I ordered the starter from Bus Depot, I also ordered a
rebuilt alternator.  The alternator in the Bus had been making noise ever
since I bought it in '99 and had never really charged as well as it should.
I ordered the alternator again with the plan of installing it before
EveryBus, but of course that didn't happen due to my California travel.

At the end of the turnpike we crossed the Delaware Memorial Bridge into (you
guessed it) Delaware, home of sales-tax-free shopping.  I can't think of
anything else Delaware is known for :-)

Delaware recoups their sales tax losses in tolls on I-95.  To cross the
Delaware Memorial Bridge costs $3.00 and then near the border of Delaware
and Maryland, Delaware hits you up for another $4.00 to use Delaware's 11
mile stretch of I-95.

Out of Delaware and into Maryland.  Through Baltimore and the Fort McHenry
Tunnel.  Down I-95 to I-495, the DC area's Capital Beltway.  I hadn't been
back to the DC area since I moved to Massachusetts last August.  It felt
like going home.  I was born and raised in that area and I do miss it.
It'll always be home.

We got on the Beltway heading west around the loop.  95 continues around the
east side of the loop but it doesn't matter which way you go, the Beltway is
a circle around DC and the loops come together again.  I-95 doesn't go
through DC itself like it does through other cities, such as Baltimore and
New York.  Instead I-95 joins the Beltway and takes you through Maryland
around DC.  This makes staying on 95 not the most direct route.  Some years
back they tried to extend 95 through DC but this plan wasn't popular with
the city's residents, and it never happened.

Our goal was Alexandria, VA, which is immediately south of DC.  If we took
the Beltway around, it would be the long way, so we got on the Beltway going
west and then got on the George Washington Memorial Parkway, which is a
great road, very scenic and at that time of night, very uncrowded.  It leads
right to Alexandria.

At the end of the parkway we followed the signs to I-395.  This route puts
you on a road (I can never remember if it's route 27 or route 110) that
leads right past the Pentagon.  The Pentagon is very close to this road and
this happens to be the side of the Pentagon that the plane crashed into on
September 11 last year.  The damaged section of the Pentagon is in the
process of being rebuilt, and in fact they have come a lot farther on it
than I would have guessed.  Then thinking about it, it's already the end of
April 2002.  September 11 was about 7 months ago.  Seems so much more recent
than that.  I can't imagine sitting there on that road in rush hour traffic
that morning and seeing those events unfold before my eyes.

We got on I-395 south and got off at the next exit and soon thereafter
arrived at Steve Dolan's house.
Even though it was getting near 1 AM at that point, he was still up and
welcomed us.  We all chatted for a bit, then set up camp in the Bus and went
to bed.  I slept like a rock starting about 2 seconds after my head hit the
pillow.  I was exhausted.  I didn't get a lot of sleep on the plane and then
I drove for 9 hours or so which is tiring enough on its own.

We woke up around 9 AM on Friday April 19.  Steve was, as always, very
hospitable (thanks Steve!) and let us get showers (which felt SO good).
Steve went above and beyond (as usual) and made us breakfast.  I had a great
omelette with cheese, mushrooms, onions and peppers inside with some rye
toast, orange juice, and coffee.

We hung out for a while, chatting about various things and also exploring
Steve's subterranean parts stash.  Then it was time to get back on the road.
We wouldn't be caravanning with Steve since he had to go to Annapolis to
pull some more parts off his parts Bus -- parts which he was supposed to
deliver to EveryBus.  So we got some more ice at the local 7-11 and some
gas, then hit the road.  Got on I-395 south somewhere around noon.  I-395
becomes I-95 and we stayed on that for some time.

The weather wasn't as bad Friday, a little cooler.  It was kind of muggy in
Alexandria but as we went south it was a little overcast and a little
cooler.  The sky was a little dark like it might rain later.

We cruised south past Fredericksburg (where I went to college) and by this
time the nice cool weather was gone and it was back to being really hot
again.  We cruised on, through Richmond and then about 20 miles south of
Richmond we got to Petersburg where we picked up I-85 south.

I like I-85, it's a nice road and not too much traffic.  The trees were just
blooming and it was a nice ride.  Still hot though.  We pulled off somewhere
in VA to get some gas and some lunch.  The sky was starting to look darker
so I thought we may get some rain.  Had to crawl under the Bus and hit the
solenoid again.  In fact, I had to do that pretty much every time we
stopped.

As we drove, the weather was strange.  We ran through spots that were very
hot and spots that were very cool.  As we got near the southern border of
Virginia, the air up ahead looked strangely hazy, like maybe it was raining
very hard.  We rolled up the windows in preparation for a lot of rain but in
fact as we got closer we realized that the stuff in the air was actually
lots of dust and tree debris from the AMAZINGLY INTENSE wind.  We learned
about the amazingly intense wind as we drove into it and the Bus was thrown
around like a toy.  The gusts came very quickly and very strongly from the
right, left, right, etc.  We were getting blown all over the place.  This
was not your run of the mill wind, I would guess at least 40 mph gusts.
Tree branches and in some cases whole trees were down, most on the side of
the road but some sticking out into the road.  Eventually we rain into the
rain, which could be classified fairly as &quot;torrential downpour.&quot;  This wind
and rain lasted well into North Carolina, making that part of the trip a
slow white-knuckle drive.

One thing that did happen was that the temperature dropped a lot, which
really felt great.

Eventually we broke out of the weather and it warmed up a bit but it wasn't
too bad for the rest of the trip.

We got to Durham, where I-40 joins up with I-85 and took us west to
Greensboro.  We got off on U.S. route 421 south and followed it until the
infamous &quot;stoplight in the middle of nowhere&quot; where we turned off and
followed the road to Hagan-Stone Park.  We pulled in around 7 PM on Friday
and found a good spot with electricity, but we were amazed at the number of
Buses already there.  We were warmly welcomed by Chris Cybulski as usual :-)

I learned my lesson last year and this year camped away from the pavilion so
as to enable sleeping at some point during the weekend.

We set up camp and had some dinner and maybe a couple hours after we
arrived, Steve Dolan came in.  Much earlier than we thought, and the reason
is because he never did go to Annapolis :-)

Friday night we made the rounds, had a cold beverage, and went to bed
relatively early.  Kate and I were both pretty tired from the trip.
We stopped by to see the Canadians, always with a cool campsite.  We saw
Andy Pechenik roll in, as well as John Yust who became an honorary Canadian
by parking his Bus in the Canadian site.  We met up with Dave Jersey, who I
totally did not recognize with hair and a beard :-)
Met up with Richard Palmer and picked up our EveryBus t-shirts, which look
great as usual.  Thanks Richard!

Saturday morning we got up bright and early for the event that is not to be
missed, the highlight of the entire weekend:  breakfast burritos cooked up
by the Full Moon Bus Club.  Every year the FMBC goes to great lengths to
keep this tradition alive and every year they pull it off.  If you haven't
had FMBC breakfast burritos, you are missing out :-)
Mmmmm chorizo.  Homemade by Dave Jersey, no less.

After breakfast I set to the task of changing my starter.  As I attempted to
remove the nut from the stud on terminal 30 of the solenoid, the plastic at
the back of the solenoid cracked (even more) and the actual stud came out of
the solenoid, with the nut and wiring still firmly attached.  D'OH!  Clearly
this solenoid was truly in bad shape :-)

I took the old starter out and then had to go to work on the nut and stud
still hanging under the Bus.  Luckily the other end of the stud is
hex-shaped and you can get a 14mm wrench on it so I managed to eventually
get the thing apart that way.  Installed the new starter and went to crank
it.

OK, it cranks right up and starts but then immediately dies.  Tried it a
couple more times with the same result.  Hmm.  Crawl back under and make
sure that I reattached all the wires to terminal 30, because I've managed
leave one off before.  Yep, left one off again.  Put that wire back on, got
out and cranked it.  Starts right up and dies.  Hmm.

Start looking in the engine room for vacuum hoses I may have knocked loose.
See that I have knocked both the hose to the auxiliary air regulator loose
and the crankcase breather hose.  Whoops!  Reattach those and it fires right
up.  Damn vacuum leaks.

Spent the rest of Saturday hanging out, taking pictures of Buses, drinking
cold beverages, etc.  Spent some time over at the Canadian campsite where
John Yust broke out his EveryBeer, which was in a very small keg.  We
managed to empty it in oh about 20 minutes :-)
Thanks John, it was very good beer, as usual.

Saturday evening Dave Jersey recruited Kate and I to be chili judges.  The
judging was very tough as there were a few top contenders and often we had
to re-sample those chilis to try to decide the winner.  We eventually picked
our winners before the hungry crowd waiting for chili rioted.

After dinner the door prizes were given away.  I manged to win one of the
coveted limited edition Matchbox EveryBus 2002 Buses.  Mine is a 21-window
ragtop with the EveryBus logo emblazoned on the sides.  There are 3 of these
Buses in existence.  One other was given away as a prize (though that one
was a panel van) and Chris kept the third :-)

After the prizes it was time for bluegrass.  The High Lonesome Strings came
out again as they did last year and put on a great show for a very
enthusiastic audience.  The show went on well past quiet hours and even then
when they finished the audience wasn't ready to let them go.

After the show it was time for bed again.

Sunday morning the Canadians cooked up a great pancake breakfast (yes, with
Canadian bacon, which tastes amazingly like what we call &quot;ham&quot;).  They also
had Canadian syrup bottles with the label on one side in French and on the
other side in English.  Many folks were perplexed as they tried to read the
French side, not thinking to turn the bottle around :-)

After breakfast we broke camp, packed up the Bus and hit the road for the
long drive back to Massachusetts.  The idea was to make the 14 hour drive
all in one sitting.  We left by 10 so were planning to be home by midnight.
We didn't want to separate the trip out into two days because I had to catch
a flight on Monday at 5 PM to go back to California.

So we hit the road.  The weather was much nicer on Sunday and the Bus was
running great.  I didn't have to bang on the solenoid anymore to start the
Bus.  Life was good :-)

The Bus ran great for the 6 hour drive back to the DC area.  We ran into
some rain around there.  At exit 152 on I-95 (Manassas exit) we pulled off
to get some gas.  Turned off the engine, filled up, went to start the engine
again, engine started but the alternator (and EGR) light stayed on.  Hmmm.
Turned off engine and started it again.  Alternator light still on.  Hmmmmm.
Pulled off to the parking lot there and thought about that.  Checked the
fuses (I remember from my '78 that there is a fuse which if it blows will
make the alternator light come on).  Fuses were all OK.  Checked the belt,
alternator belt is intact and tight.

Got out the meter and put it on the battery with the engine running.  12.2
volts.  Hmmm.  Revved the engine up.  Steady 12.2 volts.  Not good.  Battery
is really not being charged.  Strange that the alternator decided to die so
suddenly.  I have a spare so I mull my options.  At that point the only real
option was to drive to Alexandria and change the alternator out at Steve's
place, which would really put us behind because changing the alternator in a
bay window Bus is no picnic.  It would consume a good 4 hours, not to
mention the fact that it was raining.  Also there was the possibility of
breaking something during the procedure and then really being stranded.

While I'm thinking about this, 3 Buses pull into the gas station.  It's Bill
Monk, Jamie McMahon and Rich Macensky, the New England caravan on their way
home who happened to pull into the exact gas station where I was at the
exact time I needed help.  Wow.

We discussed the situation.  Jamie had a spare voltage regulator so I tried
that out.  Nope, still no good.  We decided that since the other Buses all
had auxiliary batteries, we would caravan together and swap batteries as
needed.  They would charge my dead battery in one of their Buses as we drove
while I drove on a good battery.  Then we would swap as we needed.  I would
have to avoid using lights and wipers in order to make the battery last
longer.  It was afternoon by this point and we figured we would continue
after dark and just sandwich my dark Bus in between their Buses.  We'd go as
far north as we could go.

So with that plan in place, we drove off.  Jamie supplied me with a spare
FRS radio so we could communicate when we needed to pull over.  As we left
the gas station, the alternator light went out as the engine hit about 2000
rpm.  I thought we were in business but a few miles up the road the light
came back on and stayed on.

By then the rain had stopped so we cruised on up the road.  I kept the
lights off and tried to avoid using the turn signals as well, to preserve
the battery.  Once we got past Baltimore Bill and Jaime decided that they
were going to get a hotel room for the night and continue the journey
tomorrow.  Rich and I decided we wanted to go on, so we went to the hotel
with the rest, said our goodbyes and then went down the street to the gas
station.  Filled up with the engine running and then pulled off to the side.
We hooked up jumper cables between the Buses while they were parked so that
my battery could get charged while we took care of other needs.

After a few minutes of that, we disconnected the jumper cables and set off
again.  We went up 95, through Maryland and Delaware.  Instead of going
straight up the New Jersey Turnpike, we stayed on 95 through Philadelphia.
By this time it had gotten dark.  I was following Rich on 95 with no lights
on at all, hoping for alert following drivers and counting on those
DOT-mandated reflectors on the Bus.
Only one truck driver blew his horn at me and strangely the tollbooth
personnel didn't mention it at all.

In Philly, a light rain started but I avoided using my wipers unless
necessary.  Did have to use 'em once or twice.  As we got through Philly the
alternator light got dim rather suddenly.  I radioed Rich that we needed to
pull over, so we went up to the next exit.  As I put on the turn signal
briefly, I could feel the engine surge as the light flashed.  Uh-oh.

We pulled into a gas station (almost stalled it in the left turn lane into
the gas station, that would have sucked) and when I stopped the engine was
idling very roughly.  I put my meter on the battery and it read 9.2 volts.
So I can confirm that the FI engine will run on 9.2 volts but it won't run
very well :-)

I cut the engine off and took out the battery.  Rich took out his auxiliary
battery, a little teeny battery that he had picked up recently.  He put my
battery in his aux. battery position and I put his aux. battery in my main
battery position, we charged up a little and off we went again.

While no lights is good for conserving battery power, it's really dangerous.
I was nervous about that so I decided to rig up minimal lights so at least
others would be able to see me.  Rich had us on pretty well-lit routes
(streetlights) but just in case, I looked in the owner's manual at the
fuses.  I saw that on fuse 1 is the left taillight and left rear side marker
light.  On fuse 2 is the parking lights, and the other taillight and side
marker &amp; license plate light.  So I pulled fuse 2 to disable those lights,
leaving only fuse 1.  I pulled the headlight switch out to the parking light
position and so the only lights on the Bus were the left taillight and left
rear side marker light.  Also the instrument lights came on (yay!  I can see
the fuel gauge!) so I dimmed them down all the way.

This I figured would at least give me a little light while doing the most to
conserve battery power.

So we hit the road again.  Out of PA and into New Jersey, we eventually made
it to the turnpike.  The tollbooth operator was the only other person who
mentioned my lights being out, so I let him know what happened.

We drove for a while on the turnpike, then stopped for gas.  I had to turn
off the engine to refuel and to my amazement it started with the starter
when I needed to move away from the pumps.  We pulled off to the side and
did the jumper cables thing again to charge the battery.

We got back on the road, got to the end of the turnpike, took the George
Washington Bridge into New York and took 95 through New York and into
Connecticut.  At this point it was quite late (around midnight if not after)
and we were all getting groggy.  Driving long distances is fatiguing enough,
but driving at night without headlights is REALLY fatiguing.

In Connecticut we pulled over to another rest area to charge the battery.  I
was amazed at how well Rich's little battery was doing.  It was holding a
charge very very well and for long periods of time.

Rich lives in Rhode Island but he very kindly offered to take us to his
parents' place in Middletown, CT.  That was on our way (right off I-91, just
south of Hartford).  Rich's plan was to have us camp overnight there while
my battery was on the battery charger and then in the morning we could drive
the rest of the way to Springfield, MA.  So we continued on 95 and in New
Haven we picked up I-91 toward Hartford.  Rich's battery lasted all the way
to his parents' place in Middletown, at which we arrived sometime after 2
AM.

Rich's little battery amazingly lasted all the way from Philadelphia to
Middletown with only a couple rechargings.  And it still had a decent charge
on it when we arrived.  Amazing.

Put the battery on the charger and went to bed.  Kate and I were both
exhausted, as was Rich.
It got pretty cold that night, and there was some hail/sleet falling (I
could hear it bouncing off the pop-top).  I was glad I brought that big
sleeping bag of mine.

In the morning we got up at about 9 and just as we were preparing to install
the freshly charged battery back into my Bus, here comes the hail again.  It
did that for a while, then it turned into rain so we went inside and had a
cup of coffee until the rain subsided a bit.

Got the freshly charged battery installed and said our goodbyes to Rich.
Rich is a great guy, he really went out of his way to help us out and make
sure we got home safe.  He provided us with a place to crash Sunday night
and coffee in the morning.  I want to give a public thanks to Rich, he
really epitomizes the spirit of the Bus community.

We got back on I-91 north.  It was only a few minutes to Hartford and
Springfield is about a half hour beyond that on 91, so we made it back with
no problems on my freshly charged battery.

We unpacked the Bus and got some breakfast.  I took care of some bills and
things that I had to do before my flight.  Kate kindly gave me a ride back
down to Hartford to the airport and I made my flight.
Now I'm back out here in sunny California and I will attend to installing
the new alternator in my Bus as soon as I return next month.

We had a great time at EB this year and can't wait until next year.  Thanks
to Chris for putting it on and thanks also to all those that he thanked in
his message :-)
Thanks to the FMBC and the Canadians for great breakfasts and thanks to the
High Lonesome Strings for great music.

Thanks once again to Rich Macensky who got us out of a big jam.

Here is a link to a picture of Kate and I in the burrito line on Saturday
morning.  Thanks Rob, didn't know you took that one :-)
