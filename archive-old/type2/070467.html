I have pretty much the same setup.  Runs like a scalded dog but having trouble
with emissions.  I recently replaced idle jets and cleaned up my emissions a lot
but still not enough to pass our state standards. (Maybel I should drive down
and register in Louisiana)  Anyway...my old jets were 60 primary idle and 70
secondary idle, and I replaced them with 50 primary idle and 60 secondary idle.
Runs much better leaner.  As far as timing is concerned...If I set it to specs
it runs pretty badly..no pep!  I think 5 degrees advanced with vacuum off at 800
rpm.(something like that) But I find it runs much better and with plenty of
acceleration advanced more like12 degrees.  I understand that this can be a
risky business, and could cost you a piston if you run it too advanced.  Also
bear in mind that the factory specs are based on the FI.  With the Weber it's
anybodies guess.
