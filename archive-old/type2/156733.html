&gt; Tell you what.  All I have been doing is relaying info about AridZona Bus

Jerry Jess, don't let one person who got his nose out of joint over an
unrelated issue change the valuable information that you provide.  The
issue has been addressed.  You did absolutely nothing wrong.  Please
continue your &quot;Aridzona&quot; postings as you see fit.
