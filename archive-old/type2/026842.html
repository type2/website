&gt;check your timing that is way too hot,

It has an 009, is it supposed to be 10 deg btdc?  They put a fancy pulley on 
it with 360 degree marks.  Where is the timing mark on the case?  I only 
have a basic inductive timing light, not an advance curve type.  is this OK 
for an aircooled VW or do I need a new one?

&gt;on the brakes have you tried adjusting
&gt;them that alone can make a huge difference.
&gt;i very much doubt that you need
&gt;new drums  hope this helps a little.

Can't find the stars yet or maybe they're stuck.  On the wide-5 they adjust 
through the drum face, yes?  Are these supposed to be self-adjusting?  I 
ordered a Bentley at Amazon.  Should be here in a few days I hope.

Thanks,
