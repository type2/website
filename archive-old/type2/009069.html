Loctite
&gt; is necessary. Now I am a believer.  Don't make this mistake.

OK, Loctite is a must.  My question is, how do you get that nut off
the next time it must be removed?  The last gland nut I removed bent
my flywheel holder angle iron tool so that I had to reinforce it
before I could get the bloody thing off.  If it had Loctite on that
fine thread, I would have had to use explosives!  Does anyone have
experience with removing Loctited gland nuts?

I put it back on with anti-sieze and its been together for about
30,000 miles so far.  BTW, Bentley doesn't mention Loctite, only
renewing the spring washer if it is distorted.  I'm beginning to think
that safety wire or some other positive locking method is the way to go.

The gland nut is one of the design features I like least about VW
engines.  No wonder they went to multiple bolts on the Type 4 engine.
