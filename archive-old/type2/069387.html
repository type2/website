Subject: re: vanagon top speed

well i dont have a vanagon, but in my '72 camper i have hit 90 on
downhills, and over 85 on flats, but only for short periods as it is a bit
straining on the engine.  it pulls strongly at those speeds as well, and
70 is no problem on the flats, but in the mountains, 45 may be hopeful.

of course this is according to the vw speedo; who knows how optimistic it
really is.
