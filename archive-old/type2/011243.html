Hi Volks!

Forgive this late reaction, I've been offline for a
while :-(

Richard J (drivea69vw_at_juno_dot_com) wrote to the List:
&gt; Today, I was looking at a friends new find.  It is  a 68 hardtop westy.  
&gt; 
&gt; I noticed a couple of things.  
&gt; 
&gt; 1. The vent windows in the front doors, do not open.  I mean they have no
&gt; latch and the rubber completely seals them in.

Several Listees mentioned this as common for British buses, but
I'm not sure whether anyone said it's common for Continental,
and especially German, ones as well.  You Volks in the U.S.
got only well-equipped buses by our standards.

&gt; 2. It  doesn't have a door covering the gas tank.

Probably a missing part; it was there when the bus was new.

&gt; Is this something Volkswagen did on panel vans.

Low trim levels?  Not exclusively.  &quot;Commercial&quot; trim levels
were used on everything except the Microbus (as opposed
to Kombi), *including* Westies.  Most deluxe items were
however available as options, and most Westies were ordered
with more trim than most Kombis, Panel Vans, or Pickups
were.

Time to dig through a couple more digests now...

Airhowlingly yours,
   Erik.
