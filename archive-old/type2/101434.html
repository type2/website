&gt; I intially had trouble getting the heater to work correctly
&gt; on the bench, but then I got a hold of a fellow named robert
&gt; and his email address is warmerwagen_at_hotmail_dot_com. He messes
&gt; around with heaters here and there and we spent a couple hours
&gt; one evening on the phone and figured everything out. From
&gt; that point I was able to leave the heater running on the bench
&gt; for extended periods of time just like it should. It would
&gt; reach a given temp then the fuel pump would shut off while
&gt; the fan continued to run until it would cool slightly and then
&gt; she would fire back up. Now in the vehicle it does that a 

check your temp sensor, thermostat, and the switch, have you accidently
turned it to timed heat run, for preheating the van

&gt; couple times and then just shuts off. Then if I turn the 
&gt; switch on or off it won't start again. I let it sit for a 
&gt; couple hours and then it starts right up again. I think I
&gt; will try running it with just the purolator fuel pump and see

NO NO NO NO!!!!!!! this can cause a fire....the fuel pump is metered and
does not stay on, it not the heater controls how much fuel the heater gets

&gt; what happens. It is just a pain messing with all those fuel
&gt; lines and everything.  I just really want some heat in the bus cause I have a 8am class on M,T,Th this semester and don't want to freeze every morning! I know, I'm in TX but
&gt; it doesn't mean I like being cold (or cool I suppose for
&gt; some of you northeners)! :)

but you don't want to be TOO hot...
