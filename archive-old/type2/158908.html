Subject: Re: [T2] strange offer - thoughts?

Take the roof rack off before you sell it, and don't let it go for any 
less than a thousand.  Hell, if I was you I would have told him 1500 
just as a reflex when he offered me 1200.  I've got a rusted bus too, 
but that doesn't mean that the engine and transmission couldn't come out 
of it and be sold for 700, easy.  And like you said, the roof rack is 
worth 400.  I mean, if you need to sell the bus, there's no easier way 
than to have someone walk up the driveway.  Just don't make a deal 
you'll regret.
