&gt; Guys,

&gt; The front shock bushings on my 78 are squeeking, especially in the cool
&gt; mornings.
&gt;
&gt; What is best for these...silicone lube? or something better...or will
&gt; the silicone eat the rubber in the bushings?

First, make sure that it isn't the trailing arm bearings that are
squeaking.  Grease them until you make a mess!

Your shock bushing do not swivel.  What little movement they have is taken
up by the rubber bushing.  If they squeak a little graphite should fix
things.
