Noted, but I will not tolerate his attacks and jabs, especially when they

 Hey John- lighten up. I really appreciate all the help you have given the
 list in the past and I can understand how personal grievances can linger. I
 just want to maintain the public contribution of VW knowledge ( of which
you
 have a bunch)so that our vehicles can run forever. BTW, I do not have the
 power to ban anyone and I would surly not ban you, you have been most
 helpful to the list. Thanks again, Ted
