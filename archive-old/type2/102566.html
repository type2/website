Subject: Re: [T2] Auxiliary Heater

Have you ever riden in a vehicle heated with a gas heater?  I think you
would change your mind.  MUCH safer than propane heaters and TONS more heat.

You'll never get any heat out of the cig. lighter, that is only good for
maybe 12 amps and that's hardly enough energy to light a cig.

&gt; I don't like the gas heaters I have seen for VWs and hope this
&gt; will be a viable alternative!
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks in advance,
&gt;
