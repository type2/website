Subject: Re: Intake manifold gaskets.

My spin on this is: going the whole nine yards as I described is really
easy, doesn't take too long, and may end up saving you in the long run.
Chances are, the injector seals are cracked and need replacing.  The
gasket at the head may be cracked.  Taking the stuff apart as I described
allows you to inspect everything and do the job right.  Injector seals
cost a buck or two.  The gasket at the head costs about $5.  If you don't
get in there, you can't inspect what you've got.

You may be able to just loosen the bolts for the runners and get those
boots off... but it is much harder with everything connected.  Trust me,
this is easy stuff.  It took me about an hour (apart from the fact that I
had to get replacement nuts for the runners).

Original Question:
&gt; I decided to replace the intake manifold gaskets on my 82 2.0L Vanagon
&gt; this weekend....Any suggestions on the best way to loosen up the
&gt; manifolds and replace the gaskets while the engine is still in the van?

I wrote:
&gt; Not too hard, just remove the AFM unit, disconnect the fuel ring
&gt; (at the cold start injector), disconnect the injectors from the
&gt; runners (be sure to protect the tips - wrap em in a baggie), then
&gt; remove the nuts holding the runners to the heads.  Pull the runners
&gt; out to the sides, you may have to wiggle them a bit.

Billy wrote:
&gt; If he's just doing the runner to plenum gaskets, can't he just loosen
&gt; the bolts on the runners with the injectors/electricals attached to get
&gt; the room he needs? He didn't say he was gonna do the gaskets at the block.
