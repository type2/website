&gt; They just showed us this Nova video in my epidemiology class on Chinese
&gt; esophogeal cancer, and I caught a glimpse (a very brief glimpse, mind you,
&gt; I was kind of dozing) of a thing which looked almost exactly, but not
&gt; quite, unlike a type 2.  No, no, just kidding, apologies to Douglas Adams.
&gt; But it wasn't a VW, I don't think, but looked very much like a bay-window.
&gt; Anyone know any more?  Might be an interesting conversation piece.

There used to be a East block delivery vehicle that looked a heck of a
lot like a 'loaf. I remember seeing them in East Germany and Hungary and
Bulgaria in the 80's... I wouldn't be surprised if the Chinese built
something similar - all of those designs from Wartburg and Skoda and
Lada seemed to get traded around between various Communist countries,
and although the Soviets and the Chinese weren't really getting along,
the Czechs had pretty good trading links with the PRC, didn't they?

Just some useless rambling,

Anton
