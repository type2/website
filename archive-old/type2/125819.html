    I stopped by the local tire place yesterday and told the young
fella behind the counter that I was looking for a 185R14 light truck
tire with reinforced side walls and load range of C or higher.  Of
course he insisted that I was leaving out a middle number like 65 or
70 but I just asked him to see what he could find for me.
    Last night he called me back with info.  He said he could get a
tire like I was looking for made by Geostar.  It is a light truck tire
with an 8 ply rating and load range D....
    
REPLY:

I was getting rather high prices on tires for my 1969 Bay but happened to look 
at the SAM's Club website... there I ordered some Goodrich LT tires in an 
appropriate size for pickup in Dover, Delaware.  The store called promptly; 
price was about $65 each, roughly half what I was being quoted elsewhere.  I 
can get you the specifics if you are interested.  Load range is C according to 
the Goodrich website; presumably this is OK since vehicle is not a camper.

I have a tire machine so plan to mount these myself, but balancing begins to 
look like a problem.  Several places I have asked tell me they threw away their 
adapter for the drop-centre wheel -- and this includes a specialty VW shop!

Someone ages ago mentioned the possibility of balancing the wheel while it is 
on the vehicle.  Any thoughts on balancing drop-centre wheels...anyone???

Thanks, Glenn
