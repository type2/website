Subject: Backwoods T4 Distributor Removal

Rob(s),
This is gonna sound scary to some (most), but you
might have to use good old fashioned elbow
grease...and a crow bar.
I guarantee that others on the list have done this.

I had to heat the engine case/base of the distributor
using a blow torch and then use the bar (braced
against the PCV breather housing) to pop the damn
thing out.

Be very VERY careful if you choose to try this. Don't
overheat the thing. Don't let the flame get anywhere
near anything rubber (oil pressure sender and boot is
close by). Point it at the junction at which the
distributor enters the case. Hot enough to make the
oil and other detritus surrounding the area begin to
smoke is hot enough.
Use the straight (angled) end of the bar. Place it at
the base of the distributor, with the angle pointing
up towards the distributor.  Brace it against the PCV
cast/housing and...well, push down on the bar and pry
it out.  I had to do mine from the top - through the
engine hatch. When it popped out, it bounced off the
spare tire well. It was stuck that hard...

Don't try this if you can't be careful enough with the
torch or if you tend to twist off a lot of bolts when
you work on stuff.

Hows that for die Deutsche Methode?

&gt; removing the nut and
&gt; lifting the clamp with the distributor.
