Steve, half the fun is the search...

Don't be in a hurry or shy.  Stop and ask questions.

For example, I was told to look for a blend of fibers, rather than a solid 
cotton or wool;  it will last a lot longer!!  (I have visited over 5 car 
upholstery shops to get estimated on a custom set of seat covers.  I got a 
lot of recommendations and comments)

But after all that, I still bought some heavy (mostly cotton) fabric that 
has cute teddy bears embroidered in it.  The fabric was about $25 per yard 
length, and I needed some two yards for the front seats.  I waited until 
there was a sale, and got it at my price, about $11 a yard.

I love Wal-Mart.  They often have upholstery fabric at $5 a yard!!  (you 
will need a LOT of fabric, after all.)  I bought two yards to cover my rear 
cushion, over the engine compartment.  It fits like a fitted bed sheet, no 
zippers.  (Hell, don't do zippers if you can help it. Needlessly expensive, 
since you may never wash the fabric.  BTW, the original bus fabric, and the 
curtains both wash quite easily at home and with no problem.  I took some 
top bed fabric covers in to a dry cleaner, and I would have been better 
served to just throw them in the washing machine!!)

For curtain fabric, check out the major thrift stores.  You may find some 
real old drapes, that would be fitting for a real old VW!!  Cut and sew.

If you are ever on the road, and see an interesting (that is, VW bus 
interesting) shop or store, stop.  Ask them what they are doing, and you 
will take away some memories, or some physical valuables.  What is trash to 
others is valuable to us VW busers.  I. e., fabric from a drapery overrun, 
or old foam from a classic vehicle upholsterer was some of my treasures.  I 
still have some hunks of the foam in the garage that will be used in the 
next few years.  I got a gallon of featherweight 'bondo' and a tube of 
hardener from a paint supplier, after I talked with him a while.

Best time was when I stopped for gas near a military base in Pennsylvania, 
and asked inside if they knew anybody that had VW buses like mine.  They 
mentioned a gentleman, Tucker XYZ, but thought he was dead.  I drove out to 
his last know living area, and went inside a huge garage to ask about 
Tucker.  A lady there told me that Tucker was indeed alive, and working at 
the local high school, in the vehicle (bus) maintenance dept.  I found 
Tucker, had a very nice chat with him about his life as a VW lover and full 
time (private) mechanic.  Great time.  I took away some memories this time!! 
  And a great side trip.

A few years back, I found my favorite junk yard.  I can go there for 8 
hours, get filthy dirty, drink beer until I am ready to go home, and tear 
into the vehicles there.  If they have any VW buses, I always come away with 
something.

The yard has a yellow '79 camper bus that is just about stripped.  But last 
Saturday I took a closer look at it.  It has some great front door rubber 
wipers for the roll up windows.  And I need them for a potential 
resurrection I would like to do on a '72 camper for my daughter.  Of course 
I can afford the new ones from bus depot, but finding some value in a camper 
that has just about given up all it can give is a worth while feeling.

Even if I find just a screw or nut or bolt that is better than what I have 
on my camper, well, that makes me feel good.

I really don't do too well with the other list member in my area.  I feel 
like a left handed, red headed step child!  but, I still relate to my 
camper, and we get along pretty well.

My '78 Westfalia camper is my daily driver.  If it doesn't run, then some 
one has to suffer, since we have just two running vehicles in the family.  I 
think is is about 150K miles on the original engine, and I do want to get 
the top end rebuilt so  can let it run as fast as it wants.

Right now, 60 MPH is my best top speed; 65 MPH blows out a heck of a lot of 
oil, and 70 MPH blows out a heck of a lot of seals.  But still it doesn't 
puddle, and just enough oil is splashed around underneath to keep the rust 
off!!  And even though it is crying for front shocks, it will wait patiently 
until I figure out what I want to do - I think I have a pair of front KYB 
shocks around somewhere, but they are really good hide-and-seek players.

I tried to save about 6 type 2's, but I was only successful in getting one 
to a person who brought it back to life.  What a memory!!  Flat bed trucking 
a '74 from outside Reading PA to Springfield VA and convincing my wife that 
I was not crazy and that she did not smell rat pee or see rat poop or notice 
the rust or the faded paint... That's also some of the memories, the 
understanding wife.

Now I have my second chance for saving a type 2.

Last week, my daughter asked me if she could have my '78 Westy when she gets 
to be a senior in high school.  I laughed said 'of course not' and asked her 
why she would want such a thing.

Jenna said that she wanted to paint it up with signs and pictures and school 
colors and  '2K4' for her class number and take it to the sports events!!  
She wanted it to be a 'senior's' vehicle.  She is obsessed with the phrase 
'Jenna B, a kick-butt lacrosse player' and she wants name cards made up like 
that.

What a great idea!!

So I asked her if she wanted the '72 that is in the garage, the one I was 
going to pull some parts off and throw away.

I said we could get it running, paint it a basic white color, and then she 
could paint away!!  Of course, since she is just a freshman in high school 
right now, we would have a least a year to get it on the road.  I was going 
to just do a quick rust removal and paint job on the '72 and take it to 
Manassas Virginia and get rid of it.  I was sure it would be a smart looking 
machine, since it has only 87k miles on it and it is basically a well taken 
care of VW.  Just was sitting outside, unloved for 7 years.

So, I am not going to be in a hurry, and I will give the '72 whatever time I 
have left in the week, not to interfere with my family or myself or the '78 
Westy.  If it becomes a living type 2 again, well, I feel I have added a 
quality year to my own life.  If it doesn't, and my daughter out grows this 
new found need for a 'senior's' vehicle, I will not feel bad.

But now I start my search for a full z-bed and cabinet for the back of the 
'72.  If I cannot find it, I may be doing the same reupholstery thing you 
are looking at.

But I do have my 'teddy bear' fabric already, so I am a step ahead of you!!!

most people don't know where most other people live.
