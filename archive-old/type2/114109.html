Subject: Re: Fw: [T2] MegaSquirt on westy?f

&gt;I haven't figured exactly how I'm going to deal with the coolant temp
&gt;issue.  I've been testing some various ideas, but I'm not particularly
&gt;content yet.  One person just used a gm sensor and put it in the cooling
&gt;air path and he says that works well.  Another person just adjusted the
&gt;resistance values on the board to bring his stock CHT within range...

One of the Corvair Megasquirt guys used two stock CHT sensors and wired 
them in series or parallel - can't seem to find the page that mentioned which.

www.corvairkid_dot_com

www.corvair_dot_ca

I THINK it's somewhere in those two sites.
