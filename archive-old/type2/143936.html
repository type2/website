&gt; Something I forgot to mention - I have acquired various bits of paper

&gt; a clamp style ammeter.


Current could be measured via the voltage drop in the battery cables, if
the resistance of the battery cables was known.  More likely, they were
simply comparing the battery voltage as each piston reached TDC and
looking for one that didn't drop as far.
