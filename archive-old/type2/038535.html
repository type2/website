Erich:

If this is a '73 auto trans, there is one simple reason that it might not
shift properly.
I think you should take another look at this proposed purchase;  see if the
vacuum hose from the trans to the manifold is intact.  If it is missing or
leaking, the auto trans will not shift properly.

What you do with that information is, of course, up to you...

Good luck.

&gt; Hi All
&gt;
&gt; I'm looking to buy a '73 Riviera Campmobile with auto trans.  The
&gt; transmission seems faulty since you have to manually move it from 1 to 2
&gt; then to D.  If you try to start off at D it just chugs along.  So I'm
&gt; looking at having the transmission rebuilt and I'm wondering if I might as
&gt; well just replace it with a standard.  Is this an easy swap???
&gt;
&gt; Thanks
