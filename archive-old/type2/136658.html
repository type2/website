Subject: Re: [T2] towin a bus with a Pontiac 6000

i have known people that have rented big enough box trucks for not much more than a tow dolly and drove the bus up in it and towed it that away....
i dont know what uhaul they went to though i havent ever seen a way this could be done?
i think renting a flatbed trailer will be all in all your best bet besides using a tow bar which is far more the cheapest way i would think to go?
rolls so much better with all four ties on the ground.. or all four tires off the ground...
the tow dolly in my experience does sway pretty bad when on the interstae or going up and down hills and like was said about stopping yeah thats a pain in the but....
peace

Peace and Love
