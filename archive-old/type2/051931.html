Subject: Re: [T2] Another VW? Am I nuts

I've had a bad battery exhibit those symptoms - matter of fact, one
without water wasn't taking a charge.  If the gen light ain't on, then it
means the gen is charging (unless the dash light is burned out then it
won't charge at all) just fine.

I would try cleaning the connections and putting in a new battery or at
the very least, a known good used one.
