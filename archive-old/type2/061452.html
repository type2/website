Volks, 

Let me put in an unsolicited plug here... I've seen this van (truck?) and
it is indeed that nice!  My only regret is that I don't have the money :-(
It's a traffic stopper fershure!  For all those wannabussers who want one
that &quot;needs no work&quot; this is it and you can't buy a geo metro for this
much money!
