But, Martin, how can this happen? All guns are illegal in Australia, right?

&gt; Don't know if any of you guys will get this story in the US but on the news
&gt; at the moment in the UK is the story of a Brit Bus couple touring
&gt; Austrailia.The couple were touring Aus. in an early Dormie Bay near to Alice
&gt; springs in the Northern Territories when they stopped to help some guy.The
&gt; guy then pulls a gun,ties up the girl and disappears with the guy at
&gt; gunpoint and shots are heard-the girl stuggles free and hides in the bush
&gt; for 4 hours whilst being hunted by their assailant,she managed to escape and
&gt; falg down a passing car.The Aus.police went to the scene but can't find her
&gt; boyfriend or his body-in the latest reports the police are hunting for the
&gt; boyfriend and the assailant with Aboriginal trackers but fear the worst-sad
&gt; and very scary-Martin'71 bus UK.

Yes, LEA [sic], I can. The Oklahoma City police and the FBI have confirmed 
there is another bomb in the Federal Building. It's in the east side of the 
building. They've moved everybody back several blocks.
