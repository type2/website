Subject: Re: [T2] point gap - who is right???

Ok,, I want to know

What is the dwell of the later electronic ignition from Vw,, is anyone
running that style in the bay 2.0liter engine?  Ever measured the dwell?

points are 50
pertronics is 44

&gt; Yep, on Points, dwell never lies and I generally get great
&gt; performance and mileage when running stock points....however...back to the
&gt; pertronix argument that the dwell on an electronic unit doesn't make
&gt; much difference.
&gt;
&gt; Mine runs about 44 degrees, and I don't like it there....seems like the
&gt; bus is a little slugish....and *no* amount of adjusting anything will
&gt; change it.
