Subject: WTB: Valve Covers

Does anyone have a set of bolt-on valve covers for a type 4 motor they
want to part with?  I'm tired of fighting the wire bail to get the
bloody things off and the leaks when I put them back on.  (And yes, I
use new gaskets glued with Super Weatherstrip Adhesive to the flat,
clean covers and grease on the head side of the gasket.)  I've been
doing type 1 motors for years.  Leak free.  Type 4 motor, can't get them
sealed.  New, used, it doesn't really matter.  The only ones I've been
able to find are from the Por$che Part$ $upplier, Automotion.
