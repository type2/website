Subject: Thanksgiving Misgiving campout

Yes indeed folks, just 5 more days until the possibly annual
Thanksgiving Misgivings campout!  Starting Friday afternoon and going
until Sunday. You too can join the Full Moon Bus Club at the ShortStay
campground..  All you gotta do is get there.  This not for prophets
organization is a loosely disorganized bunch of miscreants and mischief
makers who thrive on Bus-oriented activities.  Camping is merely 10$ per
night with 2 yes count them 2 camping units per site allowed.  Situated
on the shores of a lovely man-made lake with a real working lock and
only 1 egress.  Come one come all but if you don't come you will most
positively miss it!

Check out  http:www.shortstay_dot_com for directions
