The Inuvik Run -- Hope then Home

10 thru 16 August

(Log entry)

1937, 10 Aug 96 -- At Hope, BC.  368 miles in 7.6 hours.  Camping
in town.  Fierce winds.

- ----------------

Leaving Chubb Lake I tried to follow one of my famous short-cuts,
having misread the forest service map.  Given a week or two we
probably would of arrived in Quesnel.  After too many miles of dirt
road Bob Heintz took over the navigation and got us back on
pavement.  From there we had an uneventful run down the Fraser
River canyon, which I'd ascended twenty days ago heading north.

Hope is an interesting little town, someplace I'd like to revisit. 
We camped right in town in a park-like setting on the shore of the
river, just across the street from an ice cream shop and just down
from a mini-market.  The camp site was nothing special but the
people were nice and the water was hot in the showers.

The next day Eddie and his dad ran into Vancouver to collect gear
they'd stowed at Tobin's place.  We met at the border and crossed
together.  There were no hassles coming home.  

Just north of Seattle I began to experience problems with my tranny
and made a precautionary stop, waving Eddie and his dad on.  We
said our farewells via CB.  

The tranny problem proved to be a failing throw-out bearing.  I
stayed with friends in the Seattle area while I pulled the engine
and replaced the noisy bearing then buckled down and made the 1,365
mile run home in two days, clipping off 725 miles the first day,
640 the second.  The old bus will roll if you let it.

It took me four hours to cross the LA basin making my final days
run two hours longer than the day before even though I traveled a
shorter distance.  Once clear of the LA traffic I called my wife on
the cell phone to warn her of my arrival.  I growled up the drive
at a quarter past eight.  June had the outside lights on and helped
me carry in my duffle.  I gave her the little jadeite carving I'd
picked up in Whitehorse, a tiny owl.  She likes owls.

She condemned my clothes to the laundry as I sorted through a bale
of mail.  &quot;So how was it?&quot; she asked.

I had to think about it.  I'd taken pictures and made some sketches
and met some people and worked hard to keep my thirty year old
machine running.  The photos would give her a literal answer but
that wasn't what she was asking.  I'd set out on the 17th of July. 
It was now the 16th of August.  I'd driven solo 7,938 miles to the
top of the world and home again.  How was it? 

&quot;Kind of long,&quot; I smiled.  &quot;Interesting but... long.&quot;
