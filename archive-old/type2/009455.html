Greg:

We have found that 009 distributors and 34 PICT carbs don't seem to work
well together.  Most VWs suffer from an off-idle stumble and other
performance problems with this combination.  Using either a stock dual
advance distributer or switching to a 30 PICT carb seems to greatly improve
drivability. Make sure that the stock distributer you put in is a Dual
advance unit.

You didn't mention what &quot;mild performance&quot; cam was put in there.  If it too
much of a performance cam, that can cause a crazy idle.   
 
Thank you!

 I having a problem tuning my beast.  It seems my adjustments to the carb
 are having little effect.  As I adjust both mixture and air there is
 little change in engine speed.  I changed out the 009 to a vacuum
 advance to improve idle and the lower rpm range.  My points are right on
 but I'm not sure on the timing setting.  
 It's a 1600 dual port, letter code AK, runnning a new 34pict.  Recently
 rebuilt with 41 heads and a mild cam.  I know the cam wasn't the
 brightest of ideas but It was left over from my bug and I figured &quot;what
 the heck&quot;.  Anyway too late to change it.
 What effects timing?  Is it the engine year, distributor, or cam?  I've
 tried it at 5 btdc and 5 atdc.  I'm thinking maybe a small vacuum leak
 in the brake booster line since the brakes seem less effective or just a
 timing thing.
 Any takers?
