Subject: engine/tranny drop: different CV Joint bolts

I believe I may be up a creek here, but... reading Sean Barntik's tutorial on
engine removal, I went to take the CV s off to be able to drop the tranny with
the vehicle and low and behold, I have a random assortment of both 6mm allen
head bolts AND 12 point Porsche replacement bolts present. The creek comes in
when I didn't realize I had the 12 pointers till I stripped a couple out with
the 6mm allen wrench. My question then is, how do I get these things off now
and/or should I just leave the tranny in and muscle my way through dropping
the engine out alone? Any advice would be greatly appreciated...
