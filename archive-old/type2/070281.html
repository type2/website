Where can I look (VIN #, etc.) to see check the year model more closely.
- - - - 
from 69 there is a plate on the dash on the driver side,   look through the
window from the front of the bus.  okay,  move the papers  and tape caseson
the dash.    there will be a nine digit number - your VIN-, starting with 2
for type 2.  the second number refers to model, ie 6 for a truck, the third
is the last digit of year of manufacture.  the other six are the serial
number

for example    a 73 camper would have # 233 xxx xxx
