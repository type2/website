&gt; Steve,

&gt; Do you think you could work up a list of problems and their
&gt; resulting indications on the vacuum gauge?  I would love to have a
&gt; problem/cause list that describes how different problems show up on
&gt; the gauge, and judging from the reviews that you got, I think many
&gt; other list members would also like to have this information.  Thanks
&gt; in advance.

Bill,

Lazy scut that I am, I don't have to :-)  If you Google &quot;vacuum gauge
engien diagnostics&quot; you will turn up hundreds!  One I liked is:

The only mod i would make to all of them is that, by water-cooled
standards, our engines *do* have the timing very retarded.  On a
water-cooled engine, you advance the timing until the engine stumbles,
then back it off a hair.  If you try that with a VW, you will toast the
engine in short order!  If you get 17&quot; of vacuum at idle with the
distributor properly set, then be happy.
