&gt; OK, the story so far... '72 Westy with 1700 engine, stock tranny. The bus is
&gt; stuck in place and will not move. No matter what I do, the transmission will
&gt; not go into gear, nor will it roll in neutral or with the clutch engaged. The
&gt; clutch action feels normal, and I have adjusted the clutch cable both ways to
&gt; make sure that wasn't it. Other things that I have looked at are: front shift
&gt; plate, front shifter coupling, rear shifter coupling, and I even pulled the
&gt; nosecone off (as far is it comes off) and checked the shift lever and made
&gt; sure that the pin holding it in the bracket was not slipping. Just to make
&gt; sure, I knurled the end of the pin and press fitted it back in. I may go
&gt; ahead and open the nosecone again, just to make sure that I got the shift
&gt; lever in the right place, but it was doing this before I checked it. Any
&gt; further suggestions?

Does it move at all?  If not, are the brake shoes frozen to the drums?
