Subject: Re: [T2] Hydraulic lifters for '75 1.8...question

normally, hydraulic cams have much faster initial ramping to keep the
plunger from bleeding during this period.

I have always bought DIFFERENT cams for hydraulic and solid engines, even
stock applications. If you are using the same cam and it's working, then
perhaps it works! I just know what parts are available, and the theory
behind why, and have stuck with it. I know a lot of information that is NOT
in the books/manuals, but this isn't one of em'!
