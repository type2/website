Subject: more questions (was vanagon-related suicide)

Thanks for all the advice, everyone.  I'm going to replace a two old vacuum hoses this morning, even though I don't think they are leaking.  
 
I'm having two other problems, and I thought I would share them with you to see if they might be connected in some strange way.  For those of you who missed my earlier post, my 81 auto Vanagon is stalling when I stop at traffic lights.  Starting yesterday, it began to stall whenever my speed was under 25 mph.  It usually starts right up, but not always.
 
In addition - 
 
1.  It doesn't like to start on cold mornings.  I've got to crank it a good 15 seconds until it catches.  Yesterday it took me almost five minutes to get it going.
 
2.  Now here's the weird one - when I make a left turn and step on the brake, the turn signal goes all wacky.  It either slows down or stops.  Never happens when I make a right turn.  And it's intermitant as well.  Sometimes the left turn signal works just fine.
 
Hopefully, all these problems are connected and will require only one fix.  Knowing my luck, however, these are three different problems....
 
Thanks for any advice you can give.
 
Marc
