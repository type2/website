Subject: Re: [T2] split Handbrake as pseudo diff-lock for off-road use!!!

i have no intention of actually doing this, I was just curious how the
actual
lever system pictured independently actuated the rear brakes,  if i get
stuck in
soft sand/snow ever i just pull the ebrake on a notch or two. not as fancy
but it
works, of course i have only done this in rear drive later model cars, my
bus gets
pampered, its my baby after all ;-) It will never see snow, at least not
in new england where the roads get salted.
thanks for the reply!
