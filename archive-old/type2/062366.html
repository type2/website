Subject: [some VW] Record repair

&gt;My friend has a warped phonograph record, (you remember those?),
&gt;&gt;and we need a way to &quot;fix&quot; it.
Remember em? Hell, I MAKE 'em! In keeping with my habit of spending lots of
money on
archaic technology (look - VW content!) I have owned a record-pressing
plant for the
last few years. Any singer/songwriter/mechanics want to trade  bodywork for
45rpm singles?
Anyways... bout the only thing I know of that works more than half the time
is to take
two sheets of *tempered* glass (window is too light and too easy to break.
Mainly too
light), place the record between the sheets, and put it in the sun for 5
minutes. Pull
it back to shade, seperate the glass panes and check to see if its still
warped. If so,
keep extending the time in the sun a few minutes at a time. THERE ARE NO
GUARANTEES! If the
record plays at all, just leave it. This procedure is a last-ditch thang.
See, if ya get it
TOO hot, the heavy glass will actually squeeze the grooves flat! Then it
will warp some
more!! Good luck-Craig
