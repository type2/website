Subject: Clutch?: 74 Bus

Hello all.  I have been lurking on this list for over two months now;
I think it's time to air my problem.

In my '74 bus (my first VW!), my clutch periodically works.  On those
times that it does work, driving it for more than 20 seconds is ample
enough time for the bus to decide that the clutch must not work.
Needless to say, driving it is now an inconvenience.  I recently
replaced the clutch cable (thinking this might solve the problem).

According to Muir, any sort of problem with shifting and/or clutch
slippage is indicative of a problem with the clutch itself.  He also
states that a high pitched whine when shifting into first could mean a
lack of grease on the flywheel.  On occasion, simply by pushing the
clutch in, I can hear such a noise.

I have decided to attempt pulling the engine (I've ordered a Bentley
manual as well as Wilson's &quot;How to rebuild. . .&quot; to accompany my
Muir).

The question is this: Is there any way that this problem could be a
faulty/tired transmission?  If I successfully get the engine out, will
a clutch problem be obvious?  Any help will be appreciated.  Thanks.
PETE
