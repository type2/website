The only place it is shown in the 68-79 Bentley is
in section 3, fuel system. On page 27, section 7.2 barely talks about it and
figure 7-2 has a drawing about it.
Very poor information.

From: &quot;zac robbins&quot; &lt;grasscutter97_at_earthlink_dot_net&gt;

&gt; They are EGR valves. At the same level on the back of each manifold is
&gt; a
&gt; bolted on pipe. Follow it from the left carb and it has a tee where it
&gt; goes
&gt; forward thru the front upper tin and then down to the EGR filter. This
&gt; is
&gt; exhaust. The balance tube also goes to the intake manifolds, but it is
&gt; just
&gt; mounted to the front upper tin and has rubber elbows on each end.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; i read and re-read this and i simply do not follow.   i do not see any
&gt; bolted on pipe??  and second where do the vac lines connect to if this
&gt; *dashpot* thing is an egr valve??
&gt;
&gt; or point me to the correct book to read up on the subject.
