Subject: Procedure: Front Shift Bushing Replacement

OK, I finally did it after months of procrastination.  I tried desperately
to find and solicit (here) a way to do it without pulling the floor mats and
dealing with removing/adjusting the shifter, but that ended up being a
futile idea.  (To those of you who were able to replace the bushing without
removing the shifter, I just couldn't make it work the way it worked out for
you -- but thank you anyway.)  Anyway, I found a compromise that worked well
for me: I had to remove the shifter to an extent, but not ALL the
way....anyway, this is what I did:

1) Put the shifter in 1st or 3rd gear.

2) Drop the pan under the front of the bus.

3) Under the bus, remove the screw on the coupler holding the front &amp; rear
shift rods together.  Slide the front rod forward to get it out of the
coupler, then pull it back as far as it will go. If this happens to move the
very front of the rod far enough back to leave enough room to get the
bushing into its seat at the very front of the shift rod, grease and install
the bushing and rejoice at being done.  (Unfortunately, this did not work in
my case despite other people's more successful experiences.)  If not, time
to go up inside the bus.

4) Remove all the floor matting up front -- a major pain, I found,
especially getting it off the gas pedal.  (Don't forget to remove the top of
the shifter.)

5) With the shifter and its base now exposed, clean/sweep around the base as
best you can and then use something (a scratching tool or a pen, which I
used) to trace around the shift plate on the floor at the bottom of the
shifter, so that you will know its position upon reinstallation.  (Thank
you, Doktor Tim!)

6) Loosen the two bolts holding the shifter base down.  I shied away from
removing them completely....I just loosened them until they almost came out
(but not quite) -- enough where I could lean the now-loose shifter against
the driver's seat, and the base was loosened from the floor.  Everything is
much looser now.  The &quot;pin&quot; at the base of the shifter (the part that
couples with the piece in which the bushing resides) will be pulled upward.

7) Go back under the bus and now move the front shift rod back far enough to
clear the opening where the front shift bushing goes.

8) Install the bushing in the circular hole (making sure the groove on its
exterior seats properly in the opening), and grease the inner part of the
bushing.

9) Move the front shift rod forward again and into the hole of the bushing.
When it's in there, move it forward and backward a little to distribute the
grease.  Make sure again that the bushing is seated in its groove properly.

10) Reattach the front and rear sections of the shift rod at the coupler.
Reinstall and tighten the coupler screw.

11) Now you need to rejoin the shift assembly.  In my experience, all I
first had to do was bring the base of the shifter back up to vertical and
then press it back into the floor, making sure that the pin was re-seated
into its spot in the ball above the shift bushing. This took some
eye-balling through the hole in the floor as I pressed the shift base back
into the hole, but not a big deal. When I thought I had it in there, I
tightened the shifter screws a bit and scrambled under the bus the check
from underneath that it was seated properly. When I saw that it was, I went
back up inside to tighten things up a little more.

12) Tighten the bolts enough to get the assembly stable but not enough to
keep it from moving.  Use a couple of screwdrivers or whatever to push &amp;
leverage the shift plate and cover plate into their original &quot;scribed&quot;
positions.  This may take some trial &amp; error as they both tend to move
around substantially as you tighten the screws at the base of the shifter.
You may need to hold the head of one or both screwdrivers against the plate
to keep it from moving as you tighten the bolts.

13) When you think you have everything in their original positions, tighten
the screws to almost-tight and test your shift pattern. First try all gears
without the engine started, then try them with power -- that is, start the
engine and see how all goes into gear. Try backing up, going forward in
first, etc. If all seems OK, tighten the shifter bolts to the max and try it
all again.  Chances are -- as was in my case -- the final tightening will
move the shift plate enough to affect the shifting.  In my case, after all
gears tested fine, upon final tightening I couldn't get it into reverse.

14) If this is the case, readjust the shift plate as necessary back into its
marked position until the shift pattern is back to normal. I found that
millimeters of movement made a huge difference. This may take a few tries.

15) Once shifting is perfect, tighten the shift plate bolts a final time,
reinstall floor mats (another major pain) and reinstall front belly pan.
Note: I suggest not reinstalling the mats until you've driven around some to
ensure the shifting is truly working OK -- I had to remove/reinistall them
twice before I got it right, and that was the most frustrating part of the
whole procedure.

That's about it. I am experiencing a very positive change in my shifting
after replacing my previously-mangled and non-existent front shift bushing.

Good Luck!
