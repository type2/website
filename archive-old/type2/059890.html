attention.

&gt; I think that happened to me. Lately the clutch hasn'f felt right and
&gt; yesterday I started getting throwout bearing noise so today I am
pulling
&gt; the engine out of the 68. That sucker just is not coming. I hate to
pry at
&gt; the engine/trans joint but I can't think what else to do. Suggestions
&gt; appreciated.

Had the same thing happen with a S*baru, which is mostly VW design
anyway.  Pilot bearing froze up and it seemed like the clutch wouldn't
disengage.

Put the bus in 4th gear, pull on the emergency brake, block the rear
wheels.  Put a wrench on the big nut on the end of the pulley.  Remove
the engine normally, but have someone move the crank back and forth as
far as it'll comfortably go while you pull the engine out.  If there
is any play in the input shaft it'll work its way out.

Be careful with prying the engine off of the tranny.  The input shaft
of the transmission isn't all that strongly attached, and if you
manage to pull it out of the tranmission it'll compound your headache!
