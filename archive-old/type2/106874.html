Subject: Re: [T2] Sway bars

Sway bars have a significant effect on the bus suspension.
They do a lot for body lean, wind, and semi-trailer effect.
Your bus has major understeer, and the 11/16 bar
will help for that. Now you ask about a larger rear bar (7/8).
This is uncharted territory. Mount the front bar, and spend
some time in an empty parking lot, both wet and dry.
Then add the rear bar and do some more testing.
Your bars are not adjustable, but tire pressure is.
Make tire pressure adjustments and make a lot of notes.
Let's see what happens. Find an auto-cross track !
Those guys will be glad to assist.

&gt; &gt; Front only or front and rear, never rear only (or bigger rear bar) b/c a
&gt; &gt; stiffer rear end leads to oversteer. Fun on the track but heart stopping
on
&gt; &gt; a wet mountain road I'd bet.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; This info is based on an old suspension book I have.

&gt; That makes sense to me but doesn't a stock bus under steer terribly to
