Subject: Re: [T2] NPT

 
--Okay, since I started this...

I said I used to design sprinklers, ID of schedule 40 steel pipe 1&quot; (I said 1 1/4&quot; accidently the first time) nominal is 1.038&quot;. No pipe of any kind is ever exactly 1&quot; ID or 1 1/4&quot; ID as it's called &quot;nominally&quot; (hence NPT = nominal pipe thread)

Billy

P.S. to Dave Bolen: I do electrical now.

&gt;Guys,

&gt;And I thought computer folks and electricians were weird.
&gt;
&gt;To me, 1.038 ain't even close to 1.250.....How do they do that?&lt;grin&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Cheers, dave

&gt;&gt; Having worked as a fire sprinkler designer, I always saw it written as &quot;nominal pipe thread&quot;, meaning pipe that had a I.D. of 1.038&quot; say, was called 1 1/4&quot; NPT
&gt;&gt;
