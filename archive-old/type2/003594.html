&gt;Problem: Brake lights not coming on in my 70 bus.

I had this problem!  Threefold answer for me:

-Sensors shot (replaced)

-Bulbs not seating in corroded old taillight housings (Jimmy-Rigged)

-Front Splash pan pinching brake sensor wiring, shorting it out all to hell
(Unpinched)



&gt;There are 6 wires total coming from the sensors:


Yah!  And those suckers are easy to short.  Too many years of rubbing on
nearby metallic components.

Don't let the MC scare you.  Just another pressurized hydraulic system.
Replace the switches and bleed the system... no worries! (mine only took 2
weeks to fix, but I replaced MC and all Wheel cyls and all hoses at the same
time... MUCHO places to leak!)
