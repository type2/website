Andy:

I didn't see anything come back to you on the list so I thought I'd take a
shot at an answer.  Inside the speedo is a little white plastic gear that
tends to crack.  Take a look at the archives (are they up now?).  Fixes
include different types of glue and to replace the whole gear (or speedo
unit).

I have this problem;   even got a replacement speedo, but there always seems
to be something more urgent to fix rather than finding out how bad my gas
mileage is.  8^)

&gt; Howdy Folks,
&gt;     My name is Andy Cottrell and I am from Indianapolis, Indiana USA.  I
&gt; am new to this list.  I have just pulled my 76 bus out of mothballs and
&gt; am started the restoration.  One thing about it is that the odometer has
&gt; not worked since I bought the bus 9 years.  The speedomoter work fine(at
&gt; least I have never gotten a ticket) but the Odo never moves.  Does
&gt; anyone have an idea what would cause this or how to fix it?  I'd like to
&gt; get it working so that I can gauge my mileage and do things like valve
&gt; adjustments at the correct mileage instead of guesstimateing like I used
&gt; to do.
&gt;
&gt; 76 1700cc automatic transmission (I don't know if that makes a
&gt; difference or not because speedo and odo are amongst those mysteries to
&gt; me that I have no idea how they work)
&gt;
&gt; Thanks,
&gt; Andy Cottrell
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; P.S.  If anyone knows of any good places to get VW parts or any
&gt; boneyards in or around Indy that have busses please let me know where
&gt; they are.  I am new to the area and bus parts seem to be very hard to
&gt; find.
