&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Ya know - after a very positive reply to my query
&gt; &gt; letter - I sent Hot VWs an article and a photo
&gt; &gt; submission about the resto-customization of
&gt; &gt; my '68 Bus - and after SIX months they
&gt; &gt; returned it to me UNPUBLISHED! I think there
&gt; &gt; were two things working against me:
&gt; &gt; etc....
&gt; So let me get this straight-you actually WANTED to appear in this trashy
&gt; rag?  I must admit, though, it was a pretty good idea to write the article
&gt; yourself.  Their writers couldn't write themselves out of a wet paper bag.
&gt; For the record I prefer VolksWorld when I can get it.

Writers?  You call them writers!!!  Oh yeah, *big* vocabulary...  Sano!
Bitchin', Awesome!  oh yeah and Trick!  

Gosh, I get such a big ejukashun from those guys.....   ;p
