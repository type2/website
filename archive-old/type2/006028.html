Don't even get me started on the &quot;lame VW mechanic/Crappy parts&quot; soapbox.

In a nutshell, my philosophy:
1. Never skimp. The cheapskate always pay the most in the long-run. Buy 
original or better, never &quot;cheaper&quot;.
2. Get ahead of the curve. Anticipate failure and prevent it. E.g.: 
compression low in one cylinder? Pull the motor and solve the problem while 
it is cheap, and in your driveway, rather than when it is a catastrophe and 
the closest town is Bent Arrow, SD.
3. Keep it stock, or damned close. While &quot;conventional wisdom&quot; abounds, 
none of this &quot;wisdom&quot; comes from experienced German-trained engineers, it 
comes from machinists and mechanics.._dot_caveat emptor.
4. Install Yosemite Sam &quot;BACK OFF&quot; mudflaps.

Peace, regards, and I must be going back to my regular &quot;off list&quot; presence 
now.
