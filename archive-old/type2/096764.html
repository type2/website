Hello All   After reading all the talk on trademarks I have to agree with 
Hoop , Not only on not being a lawyer:),  It is VWs right to protect thier 
trademark but doing so to art pieces seems  anal, going after garments and 
shops , email addresses I understand,  but cartoon pieces  No  . Porsche, BMW 
 did this 10 years ago, I saw this coming in about 1985 and changed my shops 
name to Salem Import Service from Salem VW service , I have noticed that they 
seem to pick on those that use the internet to advertise their products, 
which can only explain why they haven't gotten on me yet about the plates I 
make to sell at shows and donate to the campouts . I'm going to continue to 
make the plates but I'll change the VW logos that appear on the Buses on 
them. I think I'll put a big MD on them instead . Just my 2 cents worth   
later and have fun  Mark Dearing  Salem Import Service Salem Va   PS  all 
that have the old plates from campouts can now think of them as collectors 
items.
