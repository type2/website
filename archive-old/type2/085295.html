Subject: Re: [T2] VDO clock

Hiya Justin,

As has been mentioned the &quot;correct&quot; VDO dash clock for your application is 
the 3 inch blackface clock.  Look for the second hand, it is unique to this 
clock.  The price ranges given by other posters are pretty representative of 
what's out there.  

However, I do have a piece of additional advice.  If confronted with an 
expensive &quot;guaranteed-to-be-running&quot; clock versus an inexpensive &quot;it was 
running the last time it was in a Bus&quot; clock - go for the expensive one.  
Many people selling these things will tell you that it was running when they 
pulled it.  That is exactly the same as saying, &quot;It ain't running.&quot;  It costs 
a small fortune to fix these things and there aren't that many clock shops 
which will take on an automotive clock.  

The short of it is that a busted clock will cost you more to get running than 
one in good health.
