I have read somewhere that any horizontal radiator arrangements will have 
to be several times bigger than the original vertical radiator for your 
powerplant. Many cooling fans for traffic?

It can be done but will require creative guessing towards the size 
necessary to keep your engine cool.

You might also look at your gearing in your tranny. You may be able to run 
the later bus tranny which is stronger (I've heard) and will have a 
slightly higher gear ratio.
