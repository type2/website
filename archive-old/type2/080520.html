Subject: Re: [T2] Is this to hard for a beginner?

Johan Svanborg sends:

&gt; The second thing is the engine, the problem there is that it=B4s out of the
&gt; car and I have to get the engine home to my place and then install it in =
the
&gt; car. Now remember that I am a beginner in vw-busses and I have no ide=E1 of
&gt; how I should do to get the engine back into the car.
&gt; There must be some homepages on the internett on this issue but a haven=B4t
&gt; fund any.
&gt;=20
&gt; So what do you think? Am I just a complete fool that takes a car home tha=
t
&gt; doesn=B4t even work or are these problems easy to fix even for a beginner?
&gt; Maybe I also should tell that I bought the bus from a old friend so I kno=
w
&gt; that the engine works and that the buss is ok (or atleast was?)

The cables aren't that hard. It's basically a matter of pushing them throug=
h
and hooking up the ends. You should grease them and one guy (Bob Hoover)
recommends painting them, but cables are easy.

The engine's easy too. Get a book called &quot;How to Keep your Volkswagen Alive=
&quot;
by John Muir and turn to the engine overhaul chapter--there you will learn
how to put the engine back in. You will need a very big floor jack, because
that's what you use to get the engine in--aircooled VW engines go in from
the bottom and not the top like you do with watercooled cars.
