Subject: Re: [T2] [Q] Number of Gallons to Paint

In a message dated 4/13/06 8:28:00 AM, CTONLINE_at_webtv_dot_net writes:


&gt; The paint if it's unopened, and has no hardener in it, it will last a
&gt; lifetime--as long as it isn't in the gargage getting frozen in the
&gt; winter---and over heated in the summer--
&gt; 
&gt; I keep all opened partial paints and partial opened hardener's in an old
&gt; Crosley---
&gt; Refrigerator that is--not a station wagon--
&gt; 
&gt; 
   Just kiddin' about the paint...
I've got a never opened gallon of George
Barris Kustom Kolor Kandy Apple Red that
I keep mostly for the label...
Not kiddin' about the POR-15...I bought the
stuff from R&amp;S Strauss from their close-out
table...Still in the shipping box...Wanna quart
sized paper weight, or three... ?-(
