Subject: Re: [T2] Weber tuning- low power uphill

&gt;Where should I look first in a low power uphill situation? 
&gt;Restricted fuel delviery? I just installed 40 idf and am working 
&gt;out the tuning.

You left out 3 really important pieces of information if you want help with
this.  
  1. What type engine (upright or type IV)?  
  2. What size engine (1600, 1.7, 1.8, 2.0, other)?  
  3. You didn't make it clear if you installed a single 40IDF or a pair of
them.  

Dual 40's when properly set up will give you plenty of power both off the
line and on the top end.  Post the missing info and you'll no doubt receive
some useful input.
