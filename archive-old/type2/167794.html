&gt;  &gt; It can easily be seen that it increases viscosity to
&gt;&gt;  the point of
&gt;  &gt; uselessness at startup at least.

	I know nothing of this product, but I do know that increasing 
viscosity at startup will be harmful.
	One of NZ's more inventive scientists, Alex T Wilson, in 1956 
(working for an oil company) used specially-made piston rings with 
radioactive atoms incorporated, to measure ring wear minute by minute 
after startup (counting the radioactivity that showed up in the 
circulating oil).  He showed that nearly all the ring wear is in the 
first 10 minutes after cold start.
	This evidence was a main motive for development of multigrade 
oils, e.g the 20W-50 quite widely used in our airhowlers.
	If the oil is more viscous, it will take longer to achieve 
full-flow circulation.

	Generally, old firms like Castrol are wise to most of the 
good additives, which they put in their oils already.  It is unlikely 
that this small outfit Lucas pushing this viscosity-increaser 
deserves your money.  It may even be worse than useless.
