Subject: Re: aluminum case

&gt;Is there any one on the list running an aluminum case
&gt;succesfully? Tim

I've had one in my '71 for two or three years. It's a
1600DP, balanced, with a cam, big valve heads, T4 oil
cooler, and dual DeLorto's. I run it VERY hard on the
highway (usually pulling a trailer) in 100+ Texas heat
and have had no problems so far.
