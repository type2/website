Subject: Camping near or along my route to Cleveland
Content-type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII

Well, I'm taking a few days off and heading up to Cleveland with my family to
visit Sea World.  ( I got free tickets )

I'm leaving Wed. from St. Louis and heading East on Hwy 70 and connecting with
71 North at Columbus Ohio.

I'd like to find a nice spot to spend the night somewhere between Columbus and
Cleveland.  The wife insists on hot showers and it would be nice to have
electric hookup so I can plug in my air conditioner.

Depending upon the weather, and how the Bus is running, I'm planning on
heading down to Boone North Carolina for the Second Annual High Country Bus
Festival.  If the weather continues to be HOT!, I may dump this plan and stay
up near the lake in Cleveland for a few days.

BTW, how does one get from Cleveland to Boone NC?  Should I take 77 south to
40 and head back West?, or should I backtrack and take 75 south to 40 and go
East?

Any of you Ohio listees have any suggestions?  I would appreciate your
feedback.
