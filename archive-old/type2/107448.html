Subject: Re: [T2] color codes? What is the beige and white of '69
  called??

Rob asked:
&gt; I have a tan and white '70 bus, and I will be prepping for paint, what is the color for this bus??

For 1970, according to the sales brochure, 4 color combos were offered for the 'station wagon'.
Cloud White/ Montana Red
Cloud White/ Delta Green
Cloud White/ Savannah Beige
Cloud White/ Brillant Blue

According to the 68-71 parts manual, from August 68 to July 1970, chassis no: 219 000 001 to 210 2300 000,
models 211-216, 231-235, 261-274 came in:
L50K (47) Neptune Blue
L282 (42) Lotus White
L345 (41) Light Grey
L512 (38) Velvet Green
L567 (46) Ivory

and models 221-228, 241-251, 281, 285 came in:
L30H (68) Montana Red
L50H (67) Brillant Blue
L282 (42) Lotus White
L610 (22) Delta Green
L620 (02) Savannah Beige

all models, the wheels were L581 Cloud White, except 241-251... they were L412 Black
all bumpers were L581 except 271, 274 were L567 Ivory
hub caps were L70X grey silver  (L91 chrome color started in 71)
steering column tube, gearshift, and hand brake lever were L41 black
seat frames were LD43 grey black


&gt; b.t.w. I already have L87 so if this is the white them i'm in luck..

L87 Pearl White was Aug 67 to July 68, chassis no: 218 000 001 to 218 220 000 68 model year only in a bay...
sorry.
