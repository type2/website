Hello Everybody,

A few days ago i went down to my &quot;half wrecked&quot; 77' kombi 
and decidet to teardown the gearbox. Well meanwhile my 
engine is in rebuild (does'nt that say everybody lately?)
i'll have suficient time to repair the gearbox. I teared 
that sucker down and i started to disarm the tranny. After 
i went almost crazy to get out the diferencial (did'nt know 
that the main shaft was just screwed onto the pinion shaft) 
i figured how to get eveything apart and found a almost 
&quot;disapering&quot; reverse gear. The other gears are quite ok. 
I'll have to change the sincro rings and the bearings. The 
diferencial play is still ok, well thats what i think. The 
thing is: can i interchange diferent types of gears to get 
another final drive ratio? Could i change the 3 or 4 gear 
to reach higher speed. I already have some kind of weard 
engine/gearbox setup here. I do have a T4 2000'cc with an 
1600'cc gearbox. And with those little tires i'll have hell 
of a torque now, but probaly a lack of high cruisespeeds. 
In which relation/size should i change my gears to get a 
cruise speed of round' 120km/h (top) but still have torque 
enough remaining to climb hills in 3 gear without losing 
too much rpm's/speed. Does anybody have an idea ? Need 
advice. Also i ask myself if anybody knows how to build a 
diferencial lock. I designed one but i'm not shure if it 
works (It's on paper!). Hope that  somebody can help me 
out...

Thanxs

Michel
