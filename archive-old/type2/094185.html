Subject: Re: [T2] VDO Oil Pressure sender

There are different senders, one for light only, one for gauge only and one
for both (it has two termials on top).  I think you must have ordered the
wrong sender if you want both.


&gt; My gauges and senders came in today. The oil pressure sender only has
&gt; one terminal on it and I though it would have two:one for the VDO
&gt; gauge and one for the stock idiot light. Can I hook both up to the
&gt; same terminal or will that mess everything up?
