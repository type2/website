&gt; Good Afternoon,
&gt;
&gt; My lights don't flick from high to low beam and I want to fix them.  I have
&gt; been trying to interpret the Bentley wiring diagrams and my wiring Bundle
&gt; under the Steering Wheel, and I located a brown wire that is dis-connected
&gt; and just hanging.  I believe this to be the culprit.
&gt;
&gt; How do I know where to plug the wire from reading the Bentley book?  To
&gt; which fuse and which place?   It is on track 22 for the 1973 Bus wiring
&gt; diagram, but I can't figure out where to connect it from the book.
&gt;
&gt; Can someone please advise how to read this out of the Bentley manual.  It
&gt; should stop snowing here and be warm this weekend so I hope to get to work
&gt; on the bus Sat &amp; Sun!

Shawn,

OK, here we go...  start at the fuse box.  there is a white wire with a
black stripe running from terminal 56 on the headlight switch to terminal
56 on the headlight dimmer relay.  the headlight dimmer relay is a
latching relay.  It flips from one pole to the other when power is applied
and stays there until power is applied again.  When the lights and engine
switch are on that black/white wire should be carrying +12VDC, check it at
the back of the relay box to make sure it is.  The way to check it is to
switch your VOM to an appropriate DC voltage range (usually ~20)  and see
if the volts are there.  Black wire goes to ground (the body of the bus),
red wire goes to the terminal you are testing.

After you are sure that the relay is recieving power, then check the
outputs. Terminals 56a and  56b carry power to the high and low beam bulbs
on yellow and white wires.  With the lights and engine switched on, check
for +12VDC at both terminals. One will have it, one will not.  OK?

Now, with the lights and engine still on, take a jumper wire and attach
one end to the body (ground).  Take the other end and brush terminal 5 on
the dimmer relay (brown wire with a white trace).  You should hear a click
as the relay flops and the other of the 56a/b pair should now be recieving
voltage.  If you hear no click and it does not flip, then the relay is bad
and you need a new one.

If it did flip, then start tracing that brown/white wire back to the
steering column.  It will go up to your turn signal switch and there will
be a pair of contacts on the switch such that when you pull it towards
you, the switch closes and it attaches that brown/white wire to a second
contact with a solid brown wire on it.  The terminal numbers are 5 and 31,
but I can't remember ever seeing them, they may not be printed on the
switch.  I will bet that this is where your problem lies.  the contacts
get corroded, the axle that the arm lies on gets caught and breaks, etc.
etc.  You need a new switch if this is the case.

The final step, if all else is good is to follow the brown wire down from
terminal 31 to the body.  If it is not attached to the body, it ought to
be!

As I did with Melissa, this is the sort of thing I can describe all day
and it is totally incomprehensible, then I go and demo and it is clear and
fixed in 1/2 hour :-(((((  Sorry, but I am willing to describe all day if
it is not comprehensible, honest I am :-)
