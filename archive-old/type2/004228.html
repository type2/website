Hi Adam, as one of the other list members writes, having a hardline setup
can help a lot with the water problem.  Out of the end of the tank comes a
short horizontal pipe which ends in a T going up and down.  The down side
has a short pipe with a valve, and the up side has a long pipe which goes up
at least six feet , more if possible,, to an L.  The pipe going sideways out
of the L should slope gently towards the ground, to encourage water to drain
down.

Ok, a few feet along the sideways pipe you now put an upside down T.  The
purpose is to let any condensed water go rollong along while the air goes up
the inverted stem of the T.  So your sideways pipe goes into one arm of the
T and another pipe continues out the other arm, still sloping gently towards
the ground.  From the upward facing stem of the T comes a short pipe, say a
foot long, which then makes a U turn through two L connectors jouned by a
short pipe, and leads toward the ground with another pipe.  On the end of
this you attach an oil and water filter from Harbor Freight or other
manufacturer, and then hook up your hose.

As for the pipe the came off the arm of the T, this should go on for four
feet or so then turn down to the ground with an L keading into another pipe
with a valve on the end.  Every once in a while you open the valves in the
hard line to drain any accumulated water, just as you do with the tank.

Hope that was clear enough to follow.

Regards,
Grant


&gt;I have a 5HP air compressor in my garage for years, and I have an air
filter
&gt;installed close to it to pull out water.   I run about 50 feet of hose off
&gt;of it, and at the end of the hose there is water again.
&gt;
&gt;I use this thing quite frequently, and it really is a pain when sanding
&gt;cars, etc., to have water spraying out the vent on your tools.
&gt;
&gt;Is there something I can add in the line close to the tool that can pull
out
&gt;this water?
