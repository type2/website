&gt;I use a vacuum gauge in my 73 Bronco (302) and it's very useful.  Is anyone
&gt;here using a dash-mount vac gauge in their stock bus.  I have a 68 with
&gt;rebuilt 30/31 with two unused vac ports ABOVE the throttle plate (no good
&gt;for a real-time vac gauge) but don't see a port on the intake manifold or in
&gt;the base plate of the carb.  Would the later-year booster hose mentioned
&gt;earlier this week be a good candidate for this application?

Sure - that's what I use.  I moved my oneway valve up to the front of the bus, right behind the booster, then put a T in the booster hose right behind it and ran a small vacuum hose up behind my dash to a VDO vacuum gauge mounted in the dash.  It's probably the most useful gauge I have, although not the most important.  I watch it quite a bit.

One problem I've had is smoothing out the pulses in the vacuum.  If you hook the gauge directly to vacuum, the needle will vibrate severly.  I &quot;fixed&quot; this by putting a small metal tube inline with the vacuum hose and pinching it with a vice-grips until the pulses smooth out.  The only problem with this is that every once in a while some small particle clogs up the pinched area in the pipe and the gauge goes to zero.

I've heard that there are anti-pulse canisters you can get to solve this problem - I intend to look into that one day.
