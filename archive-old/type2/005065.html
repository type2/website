&gt; Running fuel lines in the passenger compartment is a big No-no, much less
&gt; burning it there.

I think you said this much too delicately.

Let me say it a little more forcefully because it's important:

Running fuel lines in the passenger compartment is STUPID.
Installing a gasoline-burning heater in the passenger compartment is
likewise STUPID.

Nothing like incinerating your family.  That's gotta make you feel good.

The Eberspacher gas heaters are well-designed and safe.  But I sure as hell
wouldn't put one in the passenger compartment.  Call me paranoid if you
want, but you are supposed to be paranoid with gasoline because burn wards
are scary and excruciatingly painful places.
