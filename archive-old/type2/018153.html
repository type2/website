&gt; The usual rule of thumb for 009 distributors on type IV motors is that they

&gt; you're seeing 34 degrees, you're a little past the safety zone and I'd
&gt; recommend retarding it about 4 degrees.  It will give you a little poorer

     Not so -- that's more like what it should be for a T1 upright engine, not
a T4. The T4 needs to have a total advance of 40-43 degrees at about 3500
rpm.  34 degrees is not even near enough, and not even remotely dangerous.
