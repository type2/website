&lt;&lt;  What they were stock on, or were they?

They've been around for years.  Probably started in the 50s or earlier.
They became popular with the lowrider homeboys and seem to have crossed
over to the VW crowd.  I don't think that any vehicles came stock with
them.

They tend to draw the attention of law enforcement.  Be warned.

WW II surplus...Used for shielding auto headlights (along with painting 
your headlights black and only leaving a small rectangle clear), to pre-
vent enemy bombers from zeroing in on the lights back when the bom-
bardier had to be smarter than the bombs...;-)
