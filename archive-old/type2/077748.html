Subject: Re: [T2] Heating possiblities

Jim,

As you must know, these are an absolute requirement in any RV of any size!
I would suggest a rear shelf off the bumper, with the generator stored in
the rear during travel, rather than the roof.  Install and use a BA-6 for
mobile heat and the gen for stationary heat... perfect solution!

My only hesitation on buying/installing one is that I am loathe to pay
more for an accesory than I did for the bus.... and I have *never* paid
more than $1000 for a bus! (of course, I have never bought a bus that ran,
either :-)

I know you were joking, I am just joking back a bit!  The small generators
are, however, an excellent idea if you can afford one.  They are fairly
quiet and will eliminate any concerns about 12V/shore power while camping.

                           Steve Dolan
