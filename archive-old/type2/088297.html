Mike,

Obviously this won't solve your overheating problem (timing sounds like
a good thing to try, though -- but I'm a complete newbie, so what do I
know?).... but you might want to check with Northwest Connecting Rod if
you're having trouble finding a thermostat assembly.  They sold me a
used shutter in perfect condition for $5 (versus the $30+ I've seen
online), and I imagine they have plenty of other thermostat parts on
hand.  If all you're looking for is the little rubber bellows thing, I
know John C. (aircooled_dot_net) lists those in his online catalog...

Good luck!

- Miles
