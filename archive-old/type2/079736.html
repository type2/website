Subject: Re: [T2] 30/31/34 Solex on type 4 engine? 

Yeah they used two of them is true. But the 1600 engine is not much smaller.
I suppose if you take the weight differential into account you might be
right in saying they need more gas to move that big body. Engine size-wise
though, I doubt the 34 Solex would be too small if you fattened the jets up
a bit. 1600 to 1700-1800 isn't too big a reach. A single 34 is quite common
on 1776 Type 1 engines, but again the weight might be the factor.

&gt; &gt;  She notices these stock bug
&gt; &gt; carbs are sooooo much cheaper than the those
&gt; &gt; pretty dual webers.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Any way to adapt solex to type 4 engine?
&gt; &gt; Fabricate a space to put on top of a progressive
&gt; &gt; weber manifold?  Any other single carb manifold
&gt; &gt; options for type IV?
&gt;
&gt; Are you wanting to put ONE bug carb on a typeIV engine?!?
&gt;
&gt; You would be so undercarbed I doubt it would get out of it's own shadow!
&gt; 72 to 74 1700 and 1800 used TWO 32/34 carbs.
