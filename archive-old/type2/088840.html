Subject: Need flaps connecting rod, doghouse shroud

Hi Bus brothers and sisters,

I've struck out trying to find the above connecting rod from my usual
sources. Anyone out there got one they'd like to part with? Otherwise the
engine goes back in without operating flaps until fall.

Second topic. My transmission is smooth as butter in almost every regard but
one -- downshifting from 4th to third when in motion (It does fine in the
driveway). I can make the shift by double clutching or by touching 2nd on
the way to 4th.

I'm assuming this is some ornery little synchronizer.

Two-part question:

A.  I my assumprion probably correct?

B.  How hard are these rascals to get? Do VW dealers stock?

Many thanks,

John Rogers
