Subject: Re: [T2] 76 teardown

Stan:
And I'd bet that Mike Benthin's type 4 engine with now (is it 228,000
miles?) has had a bad cam bearing for probably the last 10 years or so.
I've noticed those too. And I also noticed the bad cam bearings on a
waterboxer out of my 87 which had only 89,000 miles.
 (I wonder what causes them?)
I'm still sticking by  my first advice. Blow (and fish) out the chunks,
put on new p&amp;c's, re- done heads by someone you trust, and put it back
together.
And BTW the way, I've put in used worn cams and had the engines last
another 100,000 miles. Selected the best lifters out of a coffee can and
steel-wooled off the rust!
My brother has a saying: &quot;The difference between a professional and
amatuer mechanic is that the professional knows which bolts to leave out.&quot;

Well, he's joking, of course, but there is a kernel of wisdom in there.
Not knowing the abilities of the builder, and having reasonable confidence
that the subject engine had not been run dry of oil, I'd still not
recommend rebuilding the bottom end. I've done quite a few that way myself
and been quite pleased with the results.

The hook........... every engine had *a* bad cam bearing next to the

&gt; timing gear. This could be caused by many things but the cause is
&gt; unimportant. Split the case.
