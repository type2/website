Subject: Re: &lt;FMBC&gt; Retorque at 300 miles and you don't have to drop the
  engine

From: &quot;Mike D'Angelo&quot; &lt;hippiebus1970_at_chartertn_dot_net&gt;

&gt; when you adjust it Up to idle high does it still die at stop lights. i had
&gt; one that did that one my bus it would run like a scared wabbit until i
&gt; stopped and it die and what i found out it was is the float would stick
and
&gt; cause it do flood out.i have also seen them do this if they have an air
Leak
&gt; the air sucks in the a Vacum and causes it to dies. check all you plugs
and
&gt; what not to make sure you not sucking air.

IF I adjust the screw I have been moving (maybe it's the wrong one) I can
get it to idle fine but it will cut out and not restart.  If I adjust it
just a tad it idles soooo loud I am afraid I am going to blow the engine.
Maybe I am not gettign full throttle with the new accelerator cable.  And
the Weber being miss tuned just isn't helping matters

Thanks for the advise.  I will try and check the float in the am.  I sprayed
some wd40 type stuff (extinguisher in hand) to look for intake leaks.  There
were none.

Peace Brother,
Snoopy
