Yikes!  Don't try this at home kids!
You won't need any gas fumes to make an explosion, the hydrogen coming
from the battery will do just fine.  Sparks near the battery are a Bad
Thing.  Also, if you ever disconnect the battery, take off the ground
strap, not the positive.  That way, if you touch the wrench against the
engine or the body, it doesn't matter.
If I wanted to find which circuit was drawing current, I would put an
ammeter in place of each fuse to measure it.  This won't work in every
case though, because you can have a path to ground that isn't fused.

&gt; The first thing I do for finding shorts is to remove the
&gt; positive battery cable and check for a current between it and the
&gt; battery.
&gt; A multimeter works best, but in a pinch, I just rub the cable end over
&gt; the
&gt; positive terminal and check for little sparks (this won't work in full
&gt; daylight, it needs to be dark to really see the sparks).  (Don't do
&gt; this if
&gt; you smell any gas fumes!)
