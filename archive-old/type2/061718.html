&gt;BTW, the core charge is $250 for both.  They subtract from this each
problem
&gt;they have to fix on your cores; you'll at least get enough back to cover
the
&gt;shipping even if they are totally trashed.  In the paperwork with the new
&gt;heads they state that it can take 90 days to evaluate the cores.


This seems a common problem, FWIW I'd advise anyone of the following, DO NOT
bother sending a core into MSHP, you will be taken for it, likely all of it
without return, and I have absolutely no doubt that whatever you send if
even vaguely rebuildable (say only one seat slightly sunk as is common
failure on the T4) will still be rebuilt and go out the door.  You might as
well asess their price straight out and save the cores for someone who will
rebuild them for you at a later date (Boston Engine seems to rebuild your
actual cores for instance if desired)

My experience a set of Wasserboxer heads, and my cores were in BETTER
condition (aside from the actual gasket area which of course all must have
replaced) than the &quot;rebuilt&quot; heads I recieved (MSHP does not replace seats
on waterboxer heads and considers the small crack between the seat they all
get as OK per VW rec, both my rebuilt heads featured this crack, whereas
only one of my cores was cracked, both my cores were less corroded on the
external coolant flanges than the rebuilds (I had to machine the flanges
after receipt of the heads over .040&quot;), and both of mine were totally
uncorroded on the cylinder bore seal, whereas one of the initial rebuilds
was so corroded it would have soon leaked, and return and replacement when I
objected was a nightmare, let alone I kissed my sodium filled valves
goodbye)

Funny thing I just advised Mr Dolan to give them a shot for his new engine
as I still believe from a 2+ hour conversation with Bill out there a few
years ago they know what they do for a higher performance T4 rebuild.  But I
warn, don't even bother sending in a core, you will merely be taken, bad
business practice IMHO but no real way to object with mail order companies,
I was very lucky to get the replacement for the unuseable head they
initially sent me in a reasonable time frame.  AVP is much more liberal,
read that perhaps truthful, about what they give and what they are going to
do with your core, rebuild it.

Considering the rather extensive work MSHP undoubtedly does for any air
cooled head they touch (replacing all seats), particularly ones to be built
for their zero deck height conversion motors of for their imitation 914 2.0
heads, I consider it ludicrous they continually play these games.  I would
encourage anyone to at least mark your cores when sending them in, and if
they insist upon jerking you around, hell demand the return of YOUR marked
(engrave part of your SS# or something hidden on a fin somewhere or the
like) cores even if you get taken for $20 for shipping if you felt them
truly rebuildable and of value, which in point of fact they will eventually
be to you.

Now of course I'm talking about reasonable rebuildable quality cores, say
one seat pounded down ten or twenty or the like, not an AMC head with a seat
rocking around in the head pounded an eigth inch in or so.
