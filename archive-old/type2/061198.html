Subject: Re: sink question
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

&gt;I have a 72 camper, and was wondering on the sink, what the handle is
&gt;for next to the facet?  There is a switch on the right side of the sink
&gt;for the pump to pump the water.  Is the handle, with a black ball-like
&gt;piece of rubber on the end, a hand pump?


If your camper is actually a Westfalia, as you indicate in your signature
line, then it originally came with a mechanical hand pump, not an electrical
pump and switch.  That's what the handle is for.  The electric pump and
switch may have been installed later by a previous owner.
