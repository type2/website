Hi Folks,

I posted this one earlier from another e-mail and I am not sure if it ever made
it up.  So I will try again.

I was driving up through NY along 415.  I was about 1 mile north of Bath, on 415
and noticed in a fence in field (red fence around 5ft on the right as you are
going north) that there was a red and white splitty moving from metal to rust
looking for someone to save it.  Can't do it myself, but thought I would mention
it.

Paul

p.s. if you are driving North on 415 and you hit junction 53 you are about half
a mile past it, so turn around and look left.
