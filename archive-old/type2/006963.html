I had this problem with my 78...pedal wouldn't come all the way up...so, I 
solved it simply by putting a strong spring on the mechanism under the 
floorboard (pulling the lever in the right direction)...IF it is the spring, 
you can get them now from Ron  _at_busdepot_dot_com  for cheap....OR it could be a 
vacuum leak to the Booster (the vacuum tubes are sometimes cracked)...Also 
look at the rubberboot on the booster for tears, cracks, or dislodgement .   
Test the checkvalve on the other end of the vacuum line...does it only allow 
air suction one way?
If all of these are ok, your booster is probably bad...this to  is available 
from Ron....Hey!, and while your at it , change out the master cylinder too, 
and front calipers loaded with metalic pad's, Oh, and don't forget to 
completely rebuild your back brake's&gt;&gt;&gt;one kind of leads to another, 
y'know???...At least for me... I kinda felt new brake's are the best kind of 
investment.   But, I hope it's the spring.
