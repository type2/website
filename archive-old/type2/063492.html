Subject: Re: FS: '54 Ambulance

Thisis the same one posted a while back.  Mark Merz is selling
this.  Its a dog.  There are _none_ of the ambulance parts
on it, save the fans.  The body is actually quite rusty and beat 
up.  This is a major resto project, and good louck finding the
ambulance parts.  Rear hatch has had a hole hacked into it.

In short, its a heap.  I think my '54 will be easier to restore:
it has no collision damager.
