Subject: Warming it up

John Muir was convinced that the installation of an automatic choke
was a Volkswagen plot to make your engine wear out sooner so they
could sell you a new one. Muir was also a great believer in warming up
your VW engine before driving off claiming that it cut engine wear by at
least a third. Well, folks, I've just come across another fiendish
Volkswagen plot to make engines wear out before their time. From my 1971
KG Owner's Manual:

        &quot;As soon as the engine starts, release the ignition key
         so that the starter is switched off. Do not try to warm
         the engine up by letting it idle with the vehicle
         stationary - drive off immediately. Do not race the
         engine while it is cold....&quot;

... after all, who're ya gonna believe - John Muir or Volkswagenwerk
Aktiengesellschaft?
