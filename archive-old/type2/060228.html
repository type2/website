      Yeah, I agree -- 275 is way too hot for normal driving. What I meant was
that 275 isn't  a death notice, if it's only once and awhile -- like going up a
long steep grade on a hot day. Also what comes into play here is the reliability
of the gauge and the sender. I don't know about oiltemp senders, but cyl head
temp senders sure get goofy very easy, like a short in the wire sends it over the
top.
      Some people say that unless oil temp is up at least 212, you'll have
problems with water condensing in your oil. I really wouldn't worry too much
about anything under 250, although if it was always 250 I think I'd try another
gauge first, then start looking to see what's up.
      OTOH, a type 1 engine with it's crummy oil cooler is probably always going
to run hotter than a type 4, all else being the same, if that's possible.
