&gt; I'm telling you guys this caper would make Bus history---
&gt; Hands down---
&gt; But think about how we could centrally loctate this event---
&gt; I'm Able if you guys are Mable---

if we can make it work me and my tools and bus are there.

&gt; No slacker's or yacker's--
&gt; ( after the days work is done who care's about rhe yaking--)
&gt;
&gt; Make it a week event long event--and ya gotta be resonable--if the Bus
&gt; is a rat--ya know darn well it ain't gonna get done in a week--by a
&gt; hundred guys working on it--

that's the clincher, I know my bus needs a couple body panels replaced, I
have em, but that is a major project.  I'll be satisfied if I get
everything up to the top of the rocker panels done...it is the underside
I'm concerned most about.  has new front beam (ok good from Busted Bus)
but the center part between the axles needs the work.

&gt; First man in--is the last man out---no getting the job done and blowing
&gt; outa there.

well there would have to be a deadline, gotta go back to work, but if it
is Sun to Sat, I'll be there Sun morning and would stay til the end of
Sat..., but the boss would expect to see my shining face Mon morning or
whatever is planned.

&gt; I'd be willing to paint my ass off--but it's the prep work that'll take
&gt; the time, and man power--

you got that right, and heck if I got a decent primer coat on it I'd be
happy and finish at home...it's the bloody prep that will be time
consuming.  as I said, I have a small (3000watt) generator and a small
welder (Lincoln 100) and mid sized air compressor that I could bring if I
can fit em in the van.  plus mucho tools. but I suspect I would have to
live in a tent (can't live in the van and work on it) and don't expect you
to put us up, or maybe a nearby motel even...have to take a shower at
least once or twice in the week.

&gt; Think about it---

I've thought about it and if I can schedule it I'm there, you know the
weather, shouldn't be too hot but needs to be dry if possible...etc
&gt;
&gt; Bob---and I thought I was the only wacko here--

well never had anyone accuse me of being less than wacko?!?!?!

Bob
