Subject: Re: [T2] Tires/towbar

Tow bars at pepboys and uhaul centers.  tow dollies rented from uhaul 
etc. The hitch was  listed at bus depot and bus-boys  and i believe 
gowesty also has the hitch.  max tow  is a class one tow.  Your bug is 
going to strain the limit.

&gt; List,
&gt; A couple quick questions:
&gt; New Tires: 185/SR14. Load rating: D. Max pressure: 50
&gt; PSI. At $65 per tire. Should I get a set? Am I getting
&gt; gyped? Are they correct for my '73? Will they last?
&gt; Towbar: Where can I get a towbar or dolly that could
&gt; tow a beetle behind my bus from New Jersey to
&gt; Tennessee? It IS possible, right? Where can I get the
&gt; trailer hitch that would hold the towbar, or does it
&gt; attach some other way?
&gt;                                   Thanks!
