It could just be the clutch cable. See Bentley.

On the left side of the motor/trans is the clutch arm with the adjusting
wing nut. Reach up there and see if the cable is loose. If it is, replace
the cable. When you get the cable, get also a new pin for the clevis on the
front. They are worn in most cases and even that may have worn through and
that is all you need. Verify that before you pull the motor.
