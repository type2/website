&gt;Wondering, as I always have this ongoing rear main seal leak, even after its

&gt;
&gt;Are there different makers (brands) of the seal?  If so, what is better? 
&gt;Opinions?

German (Viton, Elring) and the test.

&gt;also, I read on the list that there may be somewhere on the flywheel that 
&gt;keeps causing it to happen.  Or a flaw in the housing?  Any ideas why this 
&gt;is an ongoing problem for me?

Several problems can exist (sometimes more than one):

- leaky oil gallery plug

No solution here except to remove the plugs, tap the holes and replace with threaded plugs. A big job.

- damaged flywheel seal bore

Sealant might help. In the worst case the bore needs to be enlarged and sleeved.

- improperly installed seal
- missing o-ring

- groove worn at flywheel/seal mating surface

This one can sometimes be compensated for by moving the seal forward or backward of the old seal. Sometimes the groove is so large that the flywheel has to be replaced.
