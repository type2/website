Subject: Re: [T2] OH CRUEL WORLD!!!!!!!!

On behalf of aircooled vw lovers,
i extend our deepest sympathies for your loss.
There is a natural period of anger and grief after 2 tragedies in a short 
period of time, and you will have to suffer. But remember, you do not suffer 
alone. as each one of the list readers cringes at your post, our hearts and 
wishes go out to you. maybe it is time to go to the american car wrecking 
yard and see all the totaled fords, always makes me feel better. Sincere 
apologies for your loss...
(i should have been a pastor)
-jeremy
