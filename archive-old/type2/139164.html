&gt; Scott,
&gt; 
&gt; I am afraid that there is a very definite difference between right and
&gt; left calipers on the the '73-79 buses.  If you will look at the bolts that
&gt; hold the caliper to the steering knuckle, you will see that one is
&gt; threaded all the way up and the other has a plain shank for part of its
&gt; length.  If you match these to the caliper, you will see that one of the
&gt; holes has a slight step in it that prevents you from inserting the wrong
&gt; bolt into the wrong hole.  It is my understanding that the plain-shank
&gt; bolt should be assembled in the trail position ONLY [1].  As a result the
&gt; calipers can only be used on one side.

Steve,

Excellent, this is the last part of the puzzle for me.

I just looked at the pair of calipers I have here and your are 100% correct
about the holes. Thanks for the correction.
