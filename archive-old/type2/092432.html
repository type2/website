Subject: Re: [T2] Light additions, inverters


Hi All, lets throw some numbers at this...

Assume the battery in question is rated the same as mine 630 amp cold cranking and 130 min at 25 amp; and that we are considering a 2litre engine.

A two litre engine starter uses about 250 amp (200amp for 1600cc) to turn the engine, add to this the current used by the coil, pump, injectors, starter solenoid, engine mangement cpu etc etc and we will probably come up to 300 amps needed to start the engine.

So what we have availlable for use while stoped is 130*(630-300)/630 = 68 min at 25 amps.

An 8 watt light draws 2/3 amp (not 1/2) so the time to run the light before the battery will not start the engine is 68*25/0.66 = 2575 min, or just under 43 hours.

You can run the numbers through for your own vehicle.

All the above assumes your battery and everything else is in perfect condition. Of course if you fit an auxilliary battery and run lights, radio, water pump, inverter etc off of that then you dont need to worry about starting in the morning.


good luck

&gt;Number #1 question:  If I had a fully charged battery when I pulled into a 
&gt;camp site, how long could I keep the 8 watt/ 0.5 amp drop light on before I 
&gt;drained the battery too low to start the fuel
