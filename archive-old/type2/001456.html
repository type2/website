Rod..

A good way to stop the cabinets rattling is to get some felt circles (1/2&quot;-
1&quot; in diameter) from the drug store or Wal-Mart.  The kind you put under the
legs of furniture to keep it from scratching the floor.

Stick them on either one or both sides that make contact, depending on the
gap, and that should cure most of the rattling.

Cheers,

does anybody know a good way to keep the cabinets from
rattling? My bus makes an awful racket on rough roads...
