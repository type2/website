Subject: Mis, sputter, no gas in fuel filter

Hi All,
Well Happy finally left me walking.  It sat for a week, ran fine before,
but last night developed a slight sputter.  This morning, the sputter
became worse and finally quit.  Upon inspection, I find the fuel filter
is dry.
I am looking for ideas of where to check first.  I am referring to the
filter leading into carb.  But you probably guessed that!
Thanx in advance
