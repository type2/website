brian,
sounds to me like your problem is mostly carb related.
  if it takes longer and longer to start, i am
assuming your bus is turning over so this should not
be a starter or battery problem.   i would recommend
going to the local flaps and buying a rebuild kit for
your carb.   take a rainy weekend afternoon and take
it apart and redo it.   not really that tricky and its
a cheap way to start trying to solve your problem.
just my $.02

&gt; hi, I am a newer poster on this list and was
&gt; wondering if you guys could
&gt; tell me how to fix or adjust my carb and or starter
&gt; so that my bus will
&gt; actually start and idle.  I think I have two
&gt; separate problems that are
&gt; slightly related.  First off is the
&gt; starter/starting.  If i go out to my
&gt; car after it has been sitting a day or two it starts
&gt; right up and idles
&gt; well with no problems.  If i start it up like that
&gt; and then take a short
&gt; trip(5min) then try starting it again right after
&gt; the short trip it
&gt; takes longer to start.  And every time i take a ride
&gt; then stop it takes
&gt; longer and longer to start.
