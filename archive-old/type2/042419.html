Subject: Re: GUAGES AD NAUSEUM was re: 3 scoop question

I'm sorry if I offended you with my reply.
I have been trying for months if not years to get some good numbers for bus 
head and oil temperatures.
Most people either don't understand or don't care.  I thought maybe since you 
were going through all the work of adding scoops and ducting and oil coolers 
that you were interested having a clear understanding of what those 
modifications were doing.
For instance did you notice the extremely close correlation between your 
&quot;engine temp&quot; and your oil temp?  That's because you measured the same thing. 
 Sump plate transducers measure the case temperature.  
Thank You and Have a Nice Day
