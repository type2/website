Subject: Mike gets Schooled in the price of his restoration...

Well kids,

The '59 Singlecab got hauled off and the restoration is under way.  
Now me being the crazy college student that I am never took the time 
to really think what this whole deal was going to cost to get 
restored. 

I was all thinking about $800 bucks or soemthing fairly reasonable.

No sir.  I was giving the guy doing the body work some cash for 
supplies and I came to the realization that this is going to get ugly 
fast.

What I've spent so far:

$750 initial investment in singlecab body (no engine/bad tranny)
$100  rear tail gate
$125  brake hardware
- ----
$ 975

What I'm spending in the next month:

$600 body work 
$425 two-tone paint job

$400 1600cc and Tranny
$200 installation

$25  passenger windscreen
$50  latch for cargo area hatch and interior door handles.

$300 interior redo.
- -----
$2000

Wow, that's fast.

I wondered how the PO of my bug could have really spent $15,000 on 
it.  Now I can easily see that.  The Singlecab is a &quot;quickie&quot; job too.

I admire Thom for his dedication on his barn door and his willingness 
to put some real money into the restoration.  Of course he's making 
an investment.

With the Singlecab, I don't want to reach the point of saturation 
where I can't sell it for what I have into it.  If I can get 
only $3000 into it, I should be able to sell it for maybe $3500 or 
$4000 and recoup some of my personal time I've put into it.  Pretty 
interesting the way that goes--

For example the '57 bus, I've abandoned any ideas of fixing it up any 
further for now.  Its in good enough shape that it's probably worth 
$5- 6k right now.  It would take at least $6-7k more to get it to the 
state that I want it--basically perfect.  But I'd never recoup that 
money, so for right now, I'm just going to keep it as is.  Its the car 
I hope to keep in my garage for 40 years, and pull it back out when 
its 80 years old!  :)

Well enough of my ramblings.
