Subject: Re: Starter Troubles

I bought an '82 Vanagon on Sunday.  Asked the seller if he had ever 
had the hot start problem.  &quot;No...?&quot; he said.  This guy hadn't driven 
it much and then only around Minneapolis.

About a hundred miles back to Wisconsin we stopped for gas.  Guess 
what...the same old same old VW trick...no start.  I was on my back 
tapping the solenoid and trying to cross the terminals to get it to 
spin with no luck.  Asked my SO to get a small plastic bag full of 
ice from the station and put this on top of the solenoid (which I 
assure you was VERY hot).  15 minutes later we were on our way.

So tell us where to get this Bosch reman. SR17X?  I have used the 
Bosch relay along with a pushbutton switch that crosses the starter 
terminals directly.  These will work, but if you say I can be done 
with this nonsense once and for all I will pay the price!!!
