Subject: Undoing Brake Lines
Message-Id: &lt;v01541100b34a174a2ddd_at_[168.100.206.34]&gt;

List-
My 72 Westy has a spongy brake pedal and appears to be leaking brake fluid
&gt;from the master cylinder. The brake fluid is also dark. My plan is to
replace the master cylinder then flush out the system by bleeding the
brakes alot. My main concern is how am I going to undo those old corroded
connections and then open the bleeders without breaking them off?  Could I
use WD40 on them and assume it will wash out with the brake fluid?  If not,
what should I use?  How can I free up the connections before I try to turn
them? On a Bus this old, should the brake lines be replaced?
Thank you all.
