Subject: Re: [T2] Bus spotting: hulkamania

&gt;I just saw the movie and a white-over-yellow Bay plays a prominent role in the
&gt;set of one scene. I can't quite remember, but I think it was 'squeeking' as it
&gt;approached the Hulk. I'll have to get the DVD when it comes out to really see
&gt;what was going on in that scene.

Just tell me they didn't destroy another cool old car (like our buses).
