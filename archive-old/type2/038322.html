 potluck was terrific!

Are there any similar events scheduled out West (I'm north of Salt Lake City, 
Utah)?  Also, is there a good website for Bus events in this region?

&gt;When we turn the wheel hard either way it makes a
 severe squeaking noise that sounds like it is coming from right under
&gt;the wheels. 

My ''80 Westy does that too, in addition to a nasty grind/squeak when 
braking.  My guess is bad bearings are allowing a brake disc to drag against 
its brake pad (or, worse, the caliper) on one side or the other.  I hope 
someone has a good answer to that -- it is indeed a rather expensive-sounding 
noise.
