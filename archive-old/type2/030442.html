Volks,

Well, I have been thru Las Vegas, and am now in Tehachapi, CA.  Started
this in Las Vegas, but did not finish, so I am adding here, so pardon any
tense discontinuities :-). One real problem with the web is that while it
may be &quot;world-wide&quot; the coverage is quite spotty.  Getting on if you are
not at home is very difficult to say the least.  And walking in the door
of a friend with the phrase &quot;Hi!  can I use your computer?&quot; does not cut
it :-)

The reason for the stop in Las Vegas was that my brother came down
&gt;from his place near Salt Lake City and I will met up with
him for two days here.  I had two free days before his arrival and 
his arrival, and so I went north and up from Las Vegas into the Toiyabe
National Forest.  There I spent 6 1/2 hours traversing 40 miles of the
most beautiful country I have ever seen.  The road was designated for
4-wheel drive, but more for the ground clearance than for any special
terrain.  I wound up spending the whole trip in 1st (averting any
overheating issue :), which accounts for the 6.5 hrs, but would not have
traveled much faster on a paved road, I just would have had more company.

Traveling cross country, again and again, I am struck by the beauty of the
vistas in the west.  I knbow from talking to people who live in the west
that there is a similar amazement with the forests of the east, at least
foir some.  Amazing how beautiful &quot;the other&quot; can be.  I know that the
rolling forests of the eastern US are beautiful, but somehow, because it
is all around and constant, I find the jagged peaks, sparse vegetation,
and wide horizons to be beautiful beyond belief :-)

Today, I visited Mark Stephens engine shop here in Tehapi.  Very
impressive!  and in a location that is beyond belief beautiful.  I intend
to report at length elsewhere on the engine, after some thought.  I do
want to that they are very helpful and suggested a shop in southern Cal.
that does tuning on a chassis dyno, which I think might just be  the
ticket (tho I still have my suspicions about overrunning the oil cooler
capacity (I also bought a spare oil cooler and aux cooler kit from Mark
Stephens)).

One thing that this engine has taught me is the systematic nature of the
FI system, and setting it at idle or even at various RPM's with out a
load, is not a representative of the real world  in which the engine
operates.From the subject lines, I get this feeling that y'all are
discussing the L-jet system, and I certainly intend to read this when I
get to a stable place , but in the mean time, I have to inject that the
importance of vacuum on hte fuel pressure regulator is *major*!  Far
greater than I would have imagined before this began.
