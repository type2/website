Subject: Cushion measurements?

I can't seem to find any measurements to work with for the fold out
bed in my 73 Westy. I have the seat itself, but not the rear cushion
that goes over the engine compartment. Can anybody help?

Here's the measurements I got off the seat:
Bottom: 46&quot; x 22&quot;
Back: 46&quot; x 19&quot;

Do those sound right? Thickness on both should be 6&quot; IIRC. But what
about the rear? 5&quot; thick?

Thanks!
