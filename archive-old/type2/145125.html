Subject: Re: [T2]Fuel filler hose

  3 ft of 2 1/4&quot; Filler hose to tank hose,NAPA 1135 NBH
GAS HOSE

  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
  that one is 22.49 a ft 
  i went with the other one 1055 NBH and will have to get it 2ft long ...
  got to go order it shortly....so will be here tomorrow..
  its 16.89 a ft...
   
  i shouldnt need but a ft of it but of course the guys at back from the dead garage(&lt;previous owners of my bus) once again screwed me here....
   
  the actual metal pipe in there that it attaches to isnt but  1 ft itself when it should be at least 2ft looking at the one of ratwells site(http://homepage.mac_dot_com/ratwell/.Pictures/78%20Camper3/81%2DFillerNeck.JPG) so this is been the whole reason its been leaking cause the(metal) pipe wasnt snug enough together...with the rubber one.....
   
  i think using 2ft of the rubber hose will compensate for the 1ft of metal pipe that isnt there....
  this metal pipe must of came out of a older bus possibly they fitted in there which also explains why my rubber elbow was torn up....
  shame shame on me for not looking at ratwells site when i replaced the rubber elbow and i wouldnt be going through this right now but ohh well live and learn and by sunday will have it fixed...xing fingers napa gets it in for me tomorrow...
  gotta work tonight and tomorrow soooooo...be sunday for a can get time to work on it...
  gotta use bus monday and tuesday for another job i am doing soooooooooo wish us luck...
  i think i will use my big red 5 gallon jug and make one or two runs to store that aways i can overfill the bus while the fuel tank /(friewall) is still off so i can see's if it leaks or anything once back together and before i close it all up....
   
  hoping that the extra ft of rubber hsoe will compensate for the extra 1ft or + thaT  is missing from the metal pipe...
   
  i will try to take some pics as i go if i rememeber and its actually light out when i tackle it all might do it after work tomorrow night...
  hmmmm depends on the bitterness of old man winter though....and how tired i am after cooking all night long in a hot kitchen...
   
  thanks for all 
   
  thanks
  hope you had a good turkey day
