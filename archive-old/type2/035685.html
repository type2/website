Subject: Pass. Step ID

List:

I'm in the process of acquiring a side step for my '78 Westy.  I now 
think that this step may be OEM but a pre-68 in origin, can anyone help 
identify it??  It has steel legs and the step is aluminum with three full
lenght &quot;rows&quot; of tread on the top surface of the aluminum step.  No numbers
to be found anywhere.  This step lookssimilar to the one pictured on 
page 76 of the March 2000 issue of VW Trends (50 Years of the Bus...).  
If anyone can help me id this piece I would really appreciate it.  
If its OEM I'll probably bead blast it and just clean it up (paint the
steel legs--what color were they originally--black?). If its some 
aftermarket piece like the Bus Boys, I'll probably blast it and have it
all coated by Jet Hot.  Anyone every done that??


TIA,
