Lloyd Elliott sends:

&gt; So listees,  I bet some of you have advice about learning to drive a bus.  I
&gt; hope you  will not all call me a fool; the deed is already done.  But I
&gt; would appreciate advice about teaching him to drive his bus.  So far he is
&gt; still getting comfortable starting and stopping in first gear on flat, wide,
&gt; quiet streets.  But I will have to let him go into second sometime.

Tell him to remember at all times where VW put the front wheels. Especially
when parallel parking--it's a bit different in a Bus, where you're sitting
directly above the front tire, than it is in a driver's ed car.
