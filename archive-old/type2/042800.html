If you're talking about a dip stick sending unit that is a good way to 
measure oil temp.  However all of the &quot;sump&quot; sending units I've seen have a 
heavy brass housing and because of this and their location they measure case 
temp.  If you're satisfied with that it's quick and relatively easy, and a 
whole lot better than nothing.  It's also slow and inaccurate.  I just think 
people should understand what they are measuring and that unless they 
calibrate the gauge the reading the reading is + or - 50 degrees.
