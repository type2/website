Harmon sez:
&gt;           I have to wonder what's wrong with the archives -- we just
&gt;discussed this at length not too long ago, and then even earlier about a
&gt;year ago or so.  

Actually, Harmon, the archives are confusing. The 'Complex Search'
says it is 'a few months behind' but the 'Standard search' and
'advanced search' say that they are '6 months behind'

Which, if either, is right?
