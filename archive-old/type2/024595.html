THANKS TO EVERYONE THAT REPLIED TO MY FIRST POST.  THANK YOU!!
 I think that I need to clearify some things.  The engines are the same year.  Oh by the way the oringinal post is at the end of this post.  The non FI engine was once an FI engine but the previous own changed it to a carb. when the ECU died.  Some of the replies suggested that maybe the fly wheel is a different size, how do I check this?  My FI engine is going to be rebuilt but I'm what to do it myself.  So it might take some time since this is my first rebuild.  So until then I still want to drive my bus.  Thanks again for your help.  Mike

Oringal post
OK, OK, I've given up on my engine.  I'm a beginner VW backyard mechanic that
has been trying to get my 78 cali. emission bus running.  Yesterday I gave
up, I didn't sell the bus but i swapped engines.  The original engine was FI
with electronic egnition, the engine I just put is a single two stage carb. 
1st problem, how do i by pass the combi relay? If i need to all?  2, do I
need to add a relay into the electrical system before the solenoid.  The
reason I ask about the relay is because the bus i removed the engine from had
a relay, of some sort wired in before the solenoid.  3, which wires go on
which terminal of the solenoid?  I have the engine in and the electrical
connected.  I thought it was correct but when i turn the key the starter
spins but will not engage?  the starter worked in the original bus?  Please
help.  Please..

P.S. Thanks for your time, Mike Q
