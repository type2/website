Subject: Passed MOT! ('62 splitty)

The nice men at Vee W Services gave Splitty a pass certificate
and adjusted the headlights for me (for nothing). Hurrah!

The clutch is working OK. I've stuffed some washers in between
the 2 adjusting nuts which effectively shortens the cable. Not a
great long-term solution I know, but it works for now. I think
perhaps I need a new guide tube... Thanks for all the help &amp;
suggestions.
