Subject: Re: [T2] Light additions, inverters and  when did VW sell out?


&gt;Barry, Dave is right about it being no problem running an 8 watt drain
&gt;all night.  A typical battery you can stuff in there should list it's
&gt;amp-hour capacity.

And my bus used to have a crank. Didnt matter if the battery went flat, you 
could just start the engine..... Ah the days...
