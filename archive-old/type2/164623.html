Subject: Re: [T2] starter swap-ability

Paul said:


There are a few different starters out there for the VW bus/vanagon,
and I thought someone on-list might be able to help with this.  I want
to know if the wasserboxer starter is compatable with a 002
bellhousing.  I understand that the late bay/early vanagon can fit, but
without the bushing.  Could it fit with some modification to the
starter, using longer bolts, cutting part of the starter shaft, etc?

What I have so far... These all fit into a 002 bellhousing and will
work without modification.  The last 2 will work if the bushing is left
off:
SR15N Starter, 12 Volt, Bus 1967 to 1975
SR15X Starter, 12 Volt, Bus 1967 to 1975 (MT)
SR17X Starter, Bus &amp; Vanagon 1974 to Early 1982 (AT)

How about the water-cooled starters?  WBX part number is SR19X or
SR401X.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Not sure what you mean  &quot;The last 2 will work if the bushing is left
off &quot;??

The difference between N and X is New and Rebuilt.

When you say &quot;I understand that the late bay/early vanagon can fit&quot; you mean the 2.0 starter which is the
SR87X. It will NOT fit, no way no how.
The drive is too long.

The SR87X fits 76 to 1/81, 2.0 air cooled.
The SR19X fits 1/81 to the end of 85, 2.0 air and 1.9 water cooled. They will not work on a 2.0 bay because
the position of the solenoid moved up higher and hits the bay floor. Imagine the SR87 solenoid at 9 o'clock
and the SR19 at 11 o'clock as you look at the back end.
