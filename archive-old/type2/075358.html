Subject: Re:  FRAM Oil Filters

More importantly, why would one by a Fram?  Couldn't
you just buy your own out cardboard and elmer's glue
and paint it orange?

They must mistakenly think that none of the vw vans
need an antidrain back valve.  I've heard the same
about the one recommended for wasserboxers, though I
avoid any aisle full of orange boxes and don't know
from first hand knowledge.  The source of many a noisy
lifter I'm sure.  Maybe you don't have to worry if
yours are not hydraulic?
