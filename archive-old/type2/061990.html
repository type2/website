Subject: I'm Ba-aack!! ;-)

Hey now,
        I'm back, sort of. You see, the list split happend after I'd hit
the road on the way to Inuvik, so I was never *really* on type2, but since
I was on its predecessor, I can kind of say I'm back. Whew, that was a
mouthful. I am a bit sad to come home to the loss of our water-cooled
brethren, but that's progress.
        Anyway, the AOL account I started for the trip (eddiehintz_at_aol_dot_com)
will be closed in a day or two, so anything sent to me should go to this
address (ehintz_at_mail.utexas_dot_edu). Any newbies who are wondering what kind
of wierdo I am can check out my home page, URL is in my .sig. And ignore
the info about the vanagon list, I haven't yet updated my page to include
type2 info... Glad to be back.
        And a great big public thanks to Todd &amp; Becky Francis, Tobin Copley
and Christa Ovenell, Bob Hoover, all the participants in the Inuvik trek,
Johnny Stutsman, Stuart Habel &amp; Kit Cohen, and everyone else whose support
helped to make the Inuvik run possible for us.

Peace,
