Subject: Re: Anyone want a ride from seattle to ny?

and you choose who goes on the list??  I dont take (or make) accusations of
marital ifedelity lightly (call me old fashioned) it would be like some one
calling you a &quot;squid&quot; because you have a navy adress. maybe all your VW
driving friends are adulterers, mine are not.

 Besides, on a more light hearted not, if he can dish it out, why cant he
take it? Does he have to have one of his big bad type2 friends stand up for
him? Did he ask you to? Or are you just taking this chance to look like the
strongman (&quot;maybe hehas the wrong list&quot; ypu said)  Look, he insulted me, i
got mad, i vented and now im over it. so lets get back to business.

as for the were you ride part, call the feeling mutual
