&gt; solid lift type IV motors have aluminum pushrods, but they are not solid.
&gt; they are tubular, albeit a heavy wall tube. they have hardened steel tips.

&gt; if you know what a 1600 DP pushrod looks like, then the solid lift type IV
&gt; pushrod looks similar only much beefier.
&gt; 
&gt; the &quot;solid&quot; pushrods are the hydraulic lifter ones, but they are still a
&gt; tube. the solid moniker comes from the fact that they are made from one
&gt; piece of material - steel - not the three-piece affair found on a solid lift
&gt; motor.

I'm sorry. You're right the tips are solid as the tube sometimes curls over
the tip when the pushrod is overworked.
