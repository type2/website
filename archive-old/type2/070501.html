&gt;Don't get me wrong, I love my Vanagon, but I would no more drive to Inuvik
&gt;in it than I would attempt an Atlantic crossing with it.  And the flip side
&gt;is I would sooner swap the Vanagon's engine than change the oil on one
&gt;of the bulletproof Japanese appliance cars.  Two different animals.

I would second the Accord wagon--Accord anything!--for utilitarian
transportation. While it might make us seethe, the industrious Japanese
took up where the Germans left off as far as utility goes. And the Germans
did leave off.

But here is the unbroken rule of working on Japanese cars:

In order to remove *that*, you must first remove something else.

Notice the logical incomprehensibility of it; a retrogression without end.
They don't care about that. They do it anyway.

Heater core in an Accord:

Costs $300 (for the part!). Involves removing the core, which involves
removing the ductwork, which involves removing the entire dash, which
involves removing the steering wheel. Takes 11 hours with two people.
Thousands of little pieces.

Alternator in Accord:

Costs $75 exchange (FLAPS). Involves removing the alternator, which
involves removing the right *axle*, which involves removing the right
steering knuckle...I gave up and had it towed to the shop.

I've done the timing belt, too, that took 10 hours.

Point is, you end up loving working on your Bus, because you *can* work on
your Bus. Ours need more coddling, but the coddling is easy and cheap.
