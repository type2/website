Subject: Re: [T2] Electric Fuel Pump Relay

Sounds like it would work like you want it and as a nice added bonus feature
it would automatically kill the engine when the oil pressure light comes on.

Would not want to do this if you have flickering oil pressure light at hot
idle :-)

The only problem I see with it is what if your oil pressure light comes on
and you are in a BAD traffic situation where you really need to move the
vehicle (i.e. turning left in front of traffic, crossing railroad tracks,
whatever)?  You are then dead in the water which could lead to an accident.

&gt; anyone tried running a hot lead to the relay coil, then grounding the
other
&gt; side through the oil sending switch? Seems to me that would do the job,
but
&gt; I could be wrong. Wouldn't be the first time. (Maybe the third time)
&gt; ((Today))
