Subject: Re: [VB] Bus Depot Order Follow-Up

I also placed an order on Ron's triple discount day.  The order arrived 
promptly.  I was missing three seals and immediately e-mailed Ron.  This 
was on the 16th.  I received a call from Dan the next day to check up on 
the order and to see how I was doing.  Well, I received the seals that I 
was missing, today.  No complaints just praises of The Bus Depot.  Thanks 
again Ron and crew for your service and the gracious offer that you gave 
the list!

Joy thru Air,
