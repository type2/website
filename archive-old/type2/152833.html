Subject: Re: [T2]tire broke inward this morning on me

Wow - I have never seen a ball joint actually separate on its own! I have
never personally tried to remove them, but I know that they can be a big
pain in the a$$ and either takes lots of hammering/pounding, a big tie-rod
like separator, and/or a lot of heat.

I don't know the best way to get it home - I guess a wheel dolly - then
towing it with another vehicle would work, I personally would NOT put the
wheel dolly on then actually try to drive it - but really, at least have
some one help you - heck get a neighbor, or a random nice person on the road
- but seriously if at all worse - call a tow company and have them flat bed
it - its not worth the cost of a possible accident...

OK - so on fixing it - since your ball joint is already out of the lower
control arm I would replace it - preferably all the ball joints (2 on each
side, upper and lower control arms) but if all necessary you cant afford to
replace all of them - just replace that one - unfortunately I believe you
need a huge press to do this - this is one of those jobs that i like to just
pay someone to do. If you end up taking it to a shop - just flat bed it to
the shop - that is the easiest route that i can see, yes I know its
relavtively expensive - but by far the safest.

Good luck!

&gt; so now thing is how to fix it?
&gt; i am not really sure and from what i have already looked at it looks as if
&gt; i will need special tools to get this all loose if indeed this is fixable
&gt; and dont understand why it would have popped off anyways?  i am tottally
&gt; confused here this is brand new to me...
