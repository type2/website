Subject: Re: [T2] Sunroof maintenance

&gt;What? Fibrous material in the cable? What are you refurning too?

I have two cables right here, left and right, the left is a strand of wire 
wrapped like a phone cord around another stranded straight piece of wire.

The right side cable I have is identical, except that the straight wire is not 
visible due to a &quot;fibrous&quot; material thats interwoven with the second phone cord 
style of wire.

Why? I dont know....

When I purchased a cable from the dealer years ago, it also has this interwoven 
material...

Anybody want some pictures?

&gt;They might be stranded cable overlayed with the twisted winds that function as 
&gt;the
&gt;drive mechanism, but when I think of fibrous I think of waffers and rice
&gt;cakes.

No I am getting hungry...
