Subject: RE: [T2] RE: Solar Panel

&gt; I haven't done it on my Westy(yet) but I would
&gt; probably look at using a flexible panel. ICP make
&gt; some, I believe. The weight would be less and it would
&gt; conform to your roof so it would be totally
&gt; aerodynamic, or as much as the bus has ever been. 

I was considering the same thing of placing them directly on the top,
but then thought of the &quot;oven effect.&quot;  I have a '71 non-poptop camper.
By placing the panels directly onto the roof, the heat absorbed is going
to radiate down and bake you!  Then another idea came to mind... making
a shell that fits over the roof.  The ideal angle for maximum power is
~30 degrees.  The dimensions of a bus roof lends itself perfectly to a
contraption that will hold a total of 6 large, flexible panels each
generating 32 watt and 1.94 Amps/hour.  This gives a total of 192 watts
and 11.64 Amps/hour at maximum efficiency.  (I'm a novice at this solar
jazz, but I'm pretty sure this is accurate.)  The contraption I have in
mind is kinda' convoluted, but theoretically possible.  I hope someday
to be able to put it together.  (I even have thoughts on making it into
a water heater as well.  All in all I don't know how practical it will
be, but the novelty of it should be interesting.

Have a good one,
Eric Shook
