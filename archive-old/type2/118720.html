Subject: Re: [T2] Parts list for a '74??

&gt; Does anyone know of a COMPLETE part number list for a '74 -- 7 passenger?
Something in electronic form would be nice so I could flatfile it in Excel
for sorting and searching. I want EVERY part number (with as much description as possible) used on my bus.

Sounds like you want an assembly manual. I have one put out by Chevrolet for my 58 Corvette but I have never
seen or heard of one put out by VW.... not even Mercedes makes one for Benz's.
My best suggestion would be to get the EKTA parts CD and study it. The pics in it are like these:

number is for #20 etc. BUT the bad part of it is: if the part is no longer available, then it says NLA and you
are screwed.....
