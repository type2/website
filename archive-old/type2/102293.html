&gt; Thanks! I am especially concerned about the short hoses where they go onto
&gt; the injectors with the manufacturer's crimped endings. It doesn't look as if
&gt; there is a lot of area to get onto beyond the crimped sleeve. Everything
&gt; else has a hose clamp, and I'm not concerned about that. I only see one
&gt; cracked piece of hose now, but I'd feel better just to go ahead and replace
&gt; every bit of it every three years, all of it at one time.

Here's what the original injector looks like under the hose; they are
barbed:

Once you start to push on the 7mm hose you would won't be able to get it off
without cutting it off.  The dished endings aren't as effective as another
hose clamp which is the popular upgrade.

New injectors have a metal ring that is crimped over the fuel line.
