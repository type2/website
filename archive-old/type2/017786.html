Subject: WTB: 2:1 Crankshaft (i.e. stock 1600 dp) Pulley
Message-Id: &lt;37247666.F4D5.01C2.000_at_MHS&gt;

In my neverending (and seemingly neversuccessful) quest to cure the
overheating problem in my 1970 Westfalia with a 1600 dual port motor, I
would like to replace the 1.8:1 ratio crank pulley of unknown origin
currently on the motor with a 2:1 or 2.1:1 ratio crank pulley.  [The ratio is
revolutions of the fan/alternator pulley to revolutions of the crankshaft
pulley.]   The higher ratio (i.e. larger diameter) pulley should also cure my
loose fan belt problem.  It is my understanding that the stock pulley from a
dual port 1600 bug (or 1971 bus I suppose) will have a 2:1 ratio.  Also,
VeeWee111 says that there are some 2.1:1 pulleys out there.  If I could
find a 2.1:1 pulley, I'd snap it  up!  I'm happy to pay a reasonable price and
shipping.  Thanks,
