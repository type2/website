Subject: '80 vanagon westfalia: charging system

I'd like a confirmation denial of my diagnosis of a problem.  To whit:

Symptoms:
- - - the battery indicator tends to drop down to yellow a day or two
  after charging with a battery charger
- - - while the engine is on, the green indicator is on
- - - immediately after turning the engine off, the indicator usually
  stays green for ten minutes or so, then turns yellow
- - - new battery, old one replaced due to the above symptoms, no change

Diagnosis:
- - - since this happens with old and new batteries, and the voltage is
  apparently fine during operation, the voltage regulator is
  not functioning correctly.

Yes/no/other?

- --

Have you checked the charging voltage?  I don't know that I would trust 
the green/yellow/red lights, since the pot could have easily been tweaked 
by the PO, rendering them useless as diagnostic tools.

I'd say your theory is probably correct, but I'd take the van to some 
place like Checker and have them do a free charging system analysis to 
determine the root cause.

Jack
