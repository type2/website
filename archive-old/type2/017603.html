&gt; &gt; Is there a list of these &quot;early 68&quot; only parts?
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;Jeff:
&gt; &gt;Wiper arms and the shafts they fasten to (?)
&gt; &gt;Transmissions are different and side seals very difficult to find
&gt; &gt;Outside door handles and maybe inside and latch mechanisms
&gt; &gt;There is no removeable panel between the fuel tank and the engine (this
&gt; &gt;doesn't exactly qualify as a one-year-only part, more like a missing
&gt; &gt;assembly!
&gt; &gt;I also seem to remember some wierdness in emergency brake cables.

&gt; A belated thank you for the response and info.  I'll tuck this away for
&gt; future reference.

Jeff and other 68 owners:
Since I posted this I've discovered that a 68 in a salvage yard still
has most of these parts on it. It's at Lichty Auto Repair, Waterloo,
Iowa. Kevin Lichty, the owner, has a website at: http://www.lichty_dot_com
Kevin has 6 or 7 t-2 parts buses, some other air-cooled, and about 25
later water-cooled for parts. He's very knowledgeable and can ship UPS.
