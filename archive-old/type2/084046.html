Subject: Re: [T2] [Fwd: Tach/Dwell Meter Usage Question?]

Must be that the components are marginal. I warmed up the van for 15 minutes
and then hooked up the meter. It works as expected. Now when my new ignition
parts arrive, I can fix this problem and start investigating electronic
ignition replacements.

Regards all and thanks for the helpful info.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Yes I hooked up the black lead to ground and the green lead to the
&gt; &gt; &gt; negative side of the coil (green wire running to the distributor).
&gt; &gt; &gt; This is per how the meter is supposed to be used. The van won't start
&gt; &gt; &gt; with the meter installed in
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; hmmm, mine has clips that go on the battery for power.  So both + &amp; - are
&gt; &gt; hooked to battery.  then a third wire is clipped to the battery, but I am
&gt; &gt; trying to remember, thought it was + side of coil but I read the
&gt; &gt; instructions every time I use it to remember
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; what brand of dwell meter do you have?
&gt;
&gt; Good point!  There are two different kinds of meter and it makes a
&gt; difference!  My analog has only two wires and hooks to ground and terminal
&gt; 1 (?+?) on the coil but if you have three wires, then the black and red go
&gt; to + and - on the battery (or other 12V source) and the sensor wire goes
&gt; to terminal 1.
&gt;
&gt; Jeff,
&gt;
&gt; It is barely  possible that your coil/condensor are so marginal that the
&gt; power take-off from the meter make the difference between starting and
&gt; not starting, but it is very unlikely.  If the bus will start w/o the
&gt; meter hooked up, start it and attach the leads while it is running.  If
&gt; that kills it, then fersure you are hooking the leads up wrong somehow.
