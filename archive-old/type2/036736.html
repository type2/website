George:

Could you relay the following message to the list?:

Listees:
I saw an interesting article in this month's (March)  &quot;HOt VW's&quot; It was
about a new package of 96mm p&amp;c s for type 4s.  The article's text didn't
mention this in the text but the illustrations show a combination of a O2
sensor, a CB fuel ratio gauge, and a variable resistor to real time adjust
your fuel mixture so you don't burn up your engine with the new p&amp;c's and
the higher resulting CR.  Does anyone else have any information on this.
How about you Dolan.  This seems like your kind of a contraption?  What do
you all think.

Have fun
