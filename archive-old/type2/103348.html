Subject: Re: [T2] Oil Temps/Humidity and the Mid-Eastern SeaBoard

Well,
Yet another lengthy thread on oil temps!!
I along with many others have been reluctant to let oil temps get above 240F
in my stock 2L dual carb bus, which it regularly gets to on a long run at
highway speeds. (I run 15W50 oil which is a dino oil blended with synthetic
according to the bottle)
That was until a recent road trip of some 4000miles which took me from
Brisbane to Adelaide through some hot dry and isolated areas. The temps were
~110-115F every day and the humidity was ~10-20%. I struggled to keep the
oil down to 250F and regularly hit 265F (using a VDO dipstick sender) for
short periods. All this on a motor that is well maintained and kept clean,
but definitely showing it's age. Consequently I did 2 oil changes on the way
just for piece of mind.
I'm not saying this is good, just that I didn't have much choice but to
continue.
The interesting thing is on the hottest days I travelled at ~50mi/hr to keep
the oil down to 250F yet the head temp hovered ~275F. In fact the only time
the head temp raised briefly to 350F was if I pushed hard on a long hill.
Another interesting point was that the oil and head temps didn't seem to
vary much when I was near the coast and the daily temps were the same but
the humidity was ~55%.
What I plan to do, rather than add an external oil cooler, is to add 'ears'
to the fresh air inlets to help scoop air in which I have heard good reports
about here.
I'm just glad I didn't have time to hook up the oil pressure gauge (the only
one not connected) because I probably would have left it on the side of the
road and walked :-).
