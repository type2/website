Subject: Re: [T2] Lower L/H Ball Joint Removal (?)

Shawn,

I did this job last month.  Here's what I found....

1. No way to tighten them.

2. Removing &amp; replacing ball joints on Type 2 torsion arms is very 
difficult; I recommend that you take it to a machine shop w/a press.  Buy 
good, German ball joints.  You might want to go ahead and replace all the 
ball joints as I don't know how having one new ball joint out of four will 
affect your steering/suspension.  Do all four esp. if your bus has more than 
175,000 miles.  If you have any extra $, do the shocks too, and you'll have 
a sweet ride.  Be aware, this is a burly job, and use a big-ass hammer to 
bang the torsion arms back into place.

&gt;Subject: [T2] Lower L/H Ball Joint Removal (?)
&gt;Date: Thu, 16 May 2002 08:26:47 -0400
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Hello,
&gt;
&gt;On my inspection last Friday I got snagged for the Lower L/H Ball Joint - I
&gt;understand there is too much play.
&gt;
&gt;(1) Is there a way to tighten this up without replacing the Ball Joint (?)
&gt;(2) If I need to replace, is it true that it's not necessary to follow the
&gt;Bentley procedure?  Has anyone tried to heat it up (as mentioned in the
&gt;Library) and then whack it out?  Can I do this job for the first time by
&gt;myself?  Do I need the press as per book?
&gt;
&gt;Thanks in advance,
&gt;Shawn
&gt;Montreal, Qc
