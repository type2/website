&gt; Hey, all I want is road legal speeds for the commute and a few errands
&gt; (less than 50 miles). The aircar sounds great!
&gt; 
&gt; Don't care to recharge each night. That's why I don't get the argument
&gt; against electric cars. What's the problem? Don't need 350 miles and 2
&gt; mins recharges, I need a city car with 100 mile range and overnight
&gt; charging. I'll take an ICE to grandma's house over the mountains...

&gt; 
&gt; Then you might consider viewin' &quot;Who Killed the Electric Car&quot;
if it comes to a nabe near you...If not, the DVD should be out
soon. I haven't seen it so I can't comment on the veracity or
not of the movie...
