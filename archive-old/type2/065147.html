Thus doth Hooper tell lies:

&gt;I cannot possibly have hooked it up wrong.

There's the post on the alternator, and there's this insulating washer. If
you put the insulating washer under the connection on the wire, it will
keep the connection from grounding into the body of the alternator,
isolating the positivive current.

Whereas if you put it on top of the connection, it will do nothing for you,
and you will make a mighty fine circuit through the case of the alternator,
running more amperes than I care to think about in a highly conductive
circle. ;)

I figured it out and got it repaired. There's no red light when I run the
bus so hopefully I didn't damage the alternator (although Lawd knows I
deserve it if I did!).
