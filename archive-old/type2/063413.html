&gt; hiyadavid,
&gt; 
&gt; every vw person i've talked to about oil filters strongly suggests
&gt; you stay away from Fram oil filters. i don't know anyone *personally*
&gt; that has had one explode, but i've heard it on the list before and today
&gt; someone posted something about one exploding. i use bosh oil filters.
&gt; i believe they have a release valve or something that keeps that from
&gt; happening. and generally i trust bosch stuff more then others. i've
&gt; just heard too much bad stuff about Fram filters to tempt fate.

Well, I use Purolator, I haven't heard anything good or bad about those
here.  If mine explodes this winter, I'll post to the list :)
