Subject: Re: [T2] Bay motor in a Vanagon?

From: Phil Cappellini
&gt; How easy or hard is it to put a 1.8L from a 1975 Westy into an aircooled 
 Vanagon? Will it easily fit or will it require a ton of adapting.
 
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------

You will need the 228mm flywheel from the Vanagon or a 76-79 bus.
You will need to swap the fan housing for a Vanagon fan housing. 
You will need the Vanagon altenator.

But:
How are you going to check the oil??   The Vanagon case has the dipstick coming 
out the TOP. No room for the bay dipstick the rear.
How are you going to put oil in it??  The bay oil fill tube will not fit in the Vanagon.
