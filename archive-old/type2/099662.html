Subject: leaking fuel pump, was: Re: [T2] bubbles in fuel filter

Perhaps.  I kept noticing fuel + grease oozing out between the pump and the
Bakelite base (this is a type1 engine), despite frequent cleanings.  Then the
oil started to smell of gas and seemed thinner.  I pulled the pump, to find 
that
nearly all of the grease had been washed out.  I rebuilt the pump, greased, and
installed.  There was no problem after that.  The diaphragm I replaced did 
not appear
to have a hole in it.  ???
