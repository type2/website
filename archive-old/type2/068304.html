Subject: Re: Busses as off-road vehicles

IMHO headlights and horns are good fer off-road travel in yer bus...
But then again Who goes fling around corners in a top heavy bus when you 
have a really steep cliff on one side of you?

Anywho Buses are okay for off road, with their high ground clearance and 
the weight over the rear end (my friend has a Ford Pickup and my bus is 
much better off-road than his truck) But I try to stay on road now the 
last time i was off-roading in the mountains I got a flat tire...and i 
had to stop every few minutes to let the old brakes have a rest......
(poured water on them ...... )

  Anyways thats my 2 and a half cents...
