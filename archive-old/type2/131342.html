Subject: Re: [T2] Heater Hose

Tim said
&gt;I am looking for the hose that runs between the heater blower motor and the 
&gt;heater box extension tube on the passenger side.  THis is a funky plastic 
&gt;tube with a round connection at the blower, and an oval shaped connection 
&gt;at the heat exchanger extension tube.

&gt;The regular paper style hose will not work due to the oval connector at one 
&gt;end.

Tim, I bought a replacement &quot; regular paper style hose &quot; for the right side, 
and I am completely UNSATISFIED with it.

&gt;Does anybody . . . have a method for fabricating a replacement?

Tim, I &quot;have a method for fabricating a replacement&quot;.

If you, or anyone else is interested, please pmail me.
