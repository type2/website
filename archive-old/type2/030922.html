&gt; I have a 1980 Vanagon air cooled Westy. I installed a Stewart Warner oil
&gt; temp guage and the sending unit screws into the drain plug. I usually
&gt; consider that at 230 it is time to slow down and feel comfortable with any
&gt; reading below that. Does anyone else run a Stewart Warner or other good
&gt; quality guage? I would appreciate hearing from others as to their average
&gt; temperature. Is 270 too hot and a danger to the engine? Do I have the
&gt; sending unit in a good place to represent the actual oil temp? Tia, Steven
&gt; Phelps.

I have mine in the same location, it is a VDO brand, the temp guage is as
much an indicator of your particular vehicle than any real standard.  the
problem is that VW sets the oil temp standard AFTER the cooler, and most
guages read BEFORE the oil cooler.

if you know your engine, and it is sound keep an eye on the guage and note
any divations,  obviously very high temps are a warning.  and outside air
temp has an effect, also very few guages are perfectly accurate.

now mine at 70F  will read (new rebuilt engine, stock)

210  around town
230  on the interstate at 65MPH

I found that the engine runs coolest about 55 MPH.  figure that outside
temp is going to have a Direct effect, thus if it is 10 degrees warmer
figure it will be ten degrees hotter in the engine

lowest operating temp for my engine has been about 185 

I am keeping these readings for now because I am going to switch from dino
oil to synthetic as soon as it is broke in about 500 miles more.

want to see if there is a &quot;real&quot; difference
