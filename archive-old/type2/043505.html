Subject: Trailer hitch?

I've done a web search.  Unsuccessfully.  Anyone got links to trailer hitches
(Class 1) for late loafs?
Something w/ good pictures?  Maybe pics of yours?  Got one you ain't using...
Wanna swap somethin'?

(If I have to, I'll build my own.  Got the welder, got the steel, ain't got no
money! Need a plan!)

TIA
