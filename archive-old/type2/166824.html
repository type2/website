Subject: RE: [T2] engine stand, half of a bellhousing

Hmmn,
   
  At work, can't search the bay, but just do a search for &quot;vw engine stand&quot; or &quot;volkswagen engine stand&quot; and they usually have 2-3 models listed simultaneously.  The little 2 arm one seems a real fair deal of course you provide the engine stand part of it.  Has 1/4&quot; flanges to meet the engine flange and some little gussets on the arms themselves, I'm sure more than enough for a T1 with tin and shroud, and probably fine for a T4 until you get the exhaust on it.  But the 3 and 4 arm models are not significantly more and have a full 1/2 circle to hit the flange and substantially more arms of course.  I don't like the idea of running a T4 hanging 4 feet up there in the air anyway, for hot runs I always use the engine bearer bar on two jackstands and then my bellhousing adapter (or a full tranny) sitting on a block, nice and low to the ground.  So I'd have to take it off the adapter anyway and swapping one for the other isn't too much of a pain, just 2 bolts.
   
  John

  Who is the guy on EBay? I wouldn't mind getting one too. I've debated on
getting a bench setup but a &quot;hot stand&quot; would be even better.
