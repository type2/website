Subject: Endplay? Crankshaft moving

I am having troubles with my email all of a sudden so if this is a repeat of 
the one earlier I appologize.

I have my 2.0L basically long block, I have removed the flexplate, front 
seal (FIF), three shims. The hub is still on the rear it is next to come off 
to replace that seal as well.

I am seeing movement in the crank from front to rear at about 2.0mm - 2.5mm. 
Am I going crasy? Is this endplay that far out. Will the shims and the new 
seal etc. acount for this when reinstalled or am I looking at a goner? I 
really need to get this back in and get the bus going, I have to move soon. 
Any questions suggestions comments? Is this normal?

Thanks,

Michael Knight
