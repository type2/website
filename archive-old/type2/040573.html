I just finished tracing my no turn signal problem and found I had a poor
contact in my fuse box! Let me tell you how good it feels to find a darn
electrical problem and then be able to fix it. My daughter just had an
electrical problem with her G*o and it cost her $210 just to diagnose the
problem! Now I can drive at night without looking or cop's at every turn.
Just had to share.
