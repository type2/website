Subject: video of hippie vans

I was just cruising the web, and ran across a reference to a very cool
sounding video tape:

BUSES AND VANS. Berkeley, CA: University of California, Office of Media
Services, 1971. VIDEO/C 2301 
A tour of various &quot;hippie&quot; vans parked by the panhandle in Golden Gate
Park, San Francisco, California. Student architecture project recorded
in 1971.

The tape is in UC Berkeley's Moffit Library. Is there anyone in Berkeley
who might be able to check it out, and maybe duplicate it?
