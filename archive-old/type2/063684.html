Subject: Re: SOTO or **NEATO**?

Based on my experience, the SOTO folks, aka David Heard, are not 
worth your trouble.  You'll be lucky if you ever receive one of their 
pathetic newsletters.  NEATO, on the other hand, is priceless.  A 
very supportive, knowledgeable &amp; responsive group - great newsletter, 
great travel directory, &amp;, as Thom said, excellent ads!
