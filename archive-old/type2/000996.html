Subject: westy wannabee - advice needed on towing a Formula Vee
Message-ID: &lt;000701beb103$14d56460$226ea1cf_at_pavilion&gt;

So what is the proper greeting?  Loafers?  Two good friends have wet westies
(85 and 87), one races a Formula Vee but refuses to tow it with his 87.  I'd
like to do the same (buy a vintage Vee and tow with a loaf)

My review of the archives suggests that up to 1300 lbs or so is do-able with
a 2.0l spec motor but little is said about speed or reliability on the
earlier ones (have seen the 78 manual jpegs).  Can anybody (especially a
racer) share info on this issue?  I have an opportunity to buy a 74 westy,
might run (no keys but title), needs canvas and an interior but not rusty.
I'm wondering

- what the chassis is worth (driving cabin immaculate, camper end home made
and rough, start again)
- if there is anywhere that I MUST not find rust (I remember it as fairly
clean)
- if 70 mph on the interstate is suicide or even obtainable.

Thanks in advance from a wannabee.
