&gt; &gt; Just before I drove back to Everybus I installed a 1986 Vanagon drivers 
&gt;seat
&gt; &gt; with both armrests into Roadcow. I feel it was the best thing I've ever 
&gt;done
&gt; &gt; to a bus! All I had to do was to pound down the &quot;inner&quot; seat rails on my 
&gt;bus
&gt;
&gt;I did this to my 78 a couple years ago, and I have to agree it is the best
&gt;single thing I did for comfort in my bus,  since mine is a deluxe I had
&gt;the air duct on the door but I just removed the door side armrest,  since
&gt;it was a later bus it just slid right in.  anyone who hasn't really should
&gt;at least give it a try
