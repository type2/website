Subject: Re: Air shocks/Part # included

Jack, the air-shocks you want are available at NAPA. The part # is MA758. 
They are pretty much a direct bolt up, with the exception of having to 
replace the top mounting bolts with ones that are 3/4 inch longer. There is 
no clearence problem like you would have with coil overs. I've been running a 
set of these for about six months on my ' 78 Delux Westy, and they are great. 
I've gone out of my way to try to kill them or my top shock mounts. No such 
luck. I've run over one thousand miles of horrible logging roads in less than 
two months, and the set up just shrugs it off. On paved roads, they are 
smooth as silk, and help out with cross winds big time. The cost is around 
80.00, and it includes all of the related plumbing.
Good luck,
Parker
