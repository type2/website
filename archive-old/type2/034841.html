Subject: Re:Shed some light on the 34 PICT

I have two 71 buses and one has the factory distributor and a factory style
intake.  The other has an 009 distributor because it runs a holley 5200
(holley-weber progressive 2-barrel) on a cast manifold.  These buses get
mostly highspeed freeway driving.

On the stock intake bus, I still have a flat spot, only when the car is
partially warmed up, with factory advance distributor in a 71 type 2 even
using the new smaller venturi replacement for the 34-PICT-3, in this case I
feel it comes partially from the drop in vacuum as I open the throttle and the
spark goes retarded (a desirable function of the vacuum advance distributor).
Any choke butterfly action on would of course remove this flat spot.  My
experience with the 34 is that you can use them half the time, or more if you
are intuitive at tuning, otherwise you should not keep futzing with it.

I don't want to waste more fuel in setting it beyond working correct for a
full warm engine (see below) and it is set up so this is only at a brief
period of warm-up between the auto choke going off and the car being fully
warmed up.  This tends to make me drive softly until it's all warmed up.   I
know well the problem of lean part-throttle deriving from the bigger venturi
and throttle vane in the 34-pict car, and it can be very disruptive even with
full warm engine.

I want to reccomend that the stock carb and distributer setup are desireable,
but I have had better experience long-term using the cast manifold, 2 brl carb
conversion on my buses.

Both are dual port stock cam 1600's.  The 2-brl setup is in a 71 westy.  The
stock is on a 7-seater with metal factory sunroof, so it is a lighter (but not
featherweight) bus.   The 009 2brl engine is now setup for slightly lower
compression, runs cooler, gets overall better mileage.  The stock setup feels
like it has stock 7.5 compression, and has less top end of course, but is
noticeably more torque-y at low speeds and pulling away at traffic lights,
after it fully warms up (see below).  Exhaust systems are stock on the factory
setup motor and a header single muffler on the other.  To reward you who read
through to the end, I'll give more comparison specs about the two setups.  I
built the 2-brl motor (over and over again) and the stock was done by a shop
for PO costing him $1800 intalled (he gave me the receipt, includes new
outboard components).

I never tried to use the available vacuum taps on the holley 5200 to set up a
vacuum advance distributor since I'm satisfied with the 009.  Has anybody ever
used vacuum advance with this carb?

The dual port buses can be prone to vacuum leaks in the intake systems (brake
booster hoses, intake manifold connections, carb bushings, cracks in the heads
and bad valves) that are too small to do really do anything but contribute to
lean cold engine symptoms and maybe to making the distributor advance curve
slow off idle (especially with vacuum retard that's on the 71-up
distributor).  Lack of warm intake manifold contributes a lot to the problem.

The only correct thing to tell people to fix a flat spot /lean off power stall
is to work on two separate things:

First, getting the accelerator squirt pump to work and compensate for the
stall off line.  This thing is supposed to compensate for a completely normal
condition of lean stall anytime you step on the gas pedal (initeria of fuel
keeps it from mixing it with the air that comes through instantaneously).  The
accelerator pump arm is adjustable on most of the carbs, leave jets alone.
You will have to rebuild the carb to free up the plugged ball in the bottom of
the accelerator pump chamber (it in the intake hole and shuts the back
pressure of the pump) that causes the problems on the 34-3.

Second, now you can deal with any continuous low-power-due-to-lean-running at
partial throttle as a separate issue, related to vaccuum leaks, ignition
timing (and therefore the issue relates to distributor preference, since
advance curves affect how lean you can have your mixture), and finally you
come to the carburator.

The idle jet is not supposed to any effect partially open throttle mixture
much, although it can affect the lowest throttle settings during warmup with
the choke on.  I understand only the mainjet and air correction jets
contribute to richness settings when the venturi is open beyond the point of
feeding the idle circuit

Oh, yes you asked about jet sizes.  Mainjet stock is 122 bus muffler and 125
bug muffler for 34 pict carbs below 4000 ft elevation (if my memory is
correct) and those after less lean mixture can go to 130.  You will find specs
on how to try to refit the 34 carb to avoid flat spots in a recent edition of
vw trends magazine.  It is not the best thing to try, though.

Theoretically you could optimize your jet setup but I haven't encountered this
as a useful quest.  Richer jets to compensate for this problem are often found
in carbs set up by the mechanic-owner, but it's likely you won't encounter the
cause as incorrect lean jets unless you brought a bus back from nepal or
something.

Check your manifold connections and they always need a couple screws tightened
up, and look for any other vacuum leaks first.  If you can't find any problem,
you can consider trying the stock distributor, it can contribute to improving
the problem but usually it can't fully solve it.

The reason the stock distributor with the stock carb setup improves gas
mileage and low speed driveablility in regard to this lean spot thing, is that
it gives full advance at lower RPM under low load/high vaccuum moderate lower
rpm cruising speeds (shift into 4th at 30-35 mph and you can feel more
efficiency driving the vaccuum distributor than the 009.)
It contributes to longevity of motor by conversely not giving full advance
under conditions of lean engine (large throttle opening and low vaccuum) and
this avoids pinging/carb backfires (while maybe heating up your exhaust valve
seats).

In fact, when you experience the lean spot, the vacuum on the stock
distributor can fall off and make things worse.
Nobody really can map the whole vacuum advance curve under the various load
situations and conditions, so manuals give some no-load curve points to check
how far off you might be, and rule this out for causing some contribution to
the lean problem (lean mixture likes more advance to burn).

Meanwhile, the mechanical advance curve is going to be constant except for
likely inconsequential spring tension/mechanism friction issues at different
temperatures.  I believe the advance curve for the 009 is not the reason for
the flat spot, it is simply a design flaw in the original 34 carb.

I liked my worn-out-spring 009 that was not returning to full-off advance.
The advance curve is too wide to leave the idle speed as strong as it should
be on the stock motors so this condition made me set my timing at 7' instead
of 0 and it felt like it had the did not exceed the right full advance.
Finally the spring got so weak it was not consistant, after 350000 miles and
25 years, so I had to get a another 009 and now I set it to static time at
0(summer)-3(winter or mountains).

In your postion, as a cheapskate, I'd try to work with vaccuum tuning, keep
what I had for carb and distributor, try using the 130 main but eventually
would go to with the 2 brl setup (see below for the considerations).

If you can, try out both distributors on your factory intake car to find the
difference.  It's easy to swap and somebody should be able to lend you one to
drive around the block with if you are in a vw club or something.

The clear reason to use a 009 is that your manifold vacuum or carb vacuum tap
setup is not within the right specs.  Those specs are really not talked about,
are they, while in other cars that's what they talk about for idle performance
in hot cam engines.

What I can offer in aged wisdom on pre-72 buses (friends don't let friends buy
post 72 buses)

I always wondered about why VW engineers doing the dual port head motor design
(that came out in 1971) designed all new intake setup and larger carburator
and never thought about going up a notch on the exhaust side, in fact they
still maintained the silly bus jets at leaner size for keeping the bus muffler
with one tip and more back pressure.  My hunch is they still liked to hedge
reliability problems using the muffler system as sort of power governor, maybe
they overheated their test motors with all their attempts to balance out the
exhaust side for the bigger flow.  The need to reduce emissions was there but
would not necessarily have lead to this seeming inconsistant design upgrade.
Did they want to generate more heat and keep it in the heads and promote
leanness for achieving targets of emissions, the whole bigger flow is just a
ruse to get up the lean mixture buring at higher head temperatures?

Comparisons ( mentally compensating for the weight differences in the cars )

The 2brl/header gets 17 mgh in city, 21 mpg at 65-70 mpg freeway contant, top
speed is 77 mph, gets 20 mpg overall in heavy footed driving.  It can get 23
mgh tops with coasting down hills and cruising 55-60.  Has no problem with
extended full power driving now but used to run slightly hot, so I got
compression down to maybe 6.9 to 1 and am using a 130 holley jet to keep my
tailpipe grey instead of tan.  I would reccommend this set-up over the stock
to mechanically inclined bus owners doing camper-trekking, but would advise
trying the stock setup, if it works and you want to have the correct thing it
can be better.   I like both for the two ways I use the cars, the stock is
better if you have a stock engine compartment fetish like I sort of still do.

The original carb/exhaust gets slightly better in-town mileage owing solely to
a tighter idle fuel consumption,  this is offset by worse mileage than the
other unless you do extensive slow cruising.  Motor has top speed of about 71
mph (manual says it should be 68mph) but gets occasional hot ping at full
throttle if you push it too hard, the thing has a richer full throttle and a
leaner mid-throttle than the holley 5200.  The stock carb feels more
effiecient than the other bus below 65 mph.  It runs stock jets and always has
a sooty tailpipe tip unless long freeway driving turns it slightly grey.

I have what I consider perfect driveablity and warmup and everything with the
2-brl setup and will never give it up after 25 yrs and 350000 miles good
experience with it (same carb, even though it has terribly worn throttle
shaft  now).  Only things I can think of are I wish I could get enough flow
through the stock oil bath air cleaner (it lost power when I tried to adapt
it).

I think it increases the reliability of the motor, I have gotten 26 years out
of my case and it has 350,000 and had two normal rebuild line bores and one
due to a no-oil seized engine.  The reason is that the midrange mixture is
richer, and the full throttle is not subject to the special enrichment VW
carbs have.

The standard vw carbs give full-throttle enrichment for a little better chance
of not pinging when you climb hills fullthrottle, but I think it leads to a
false sense of security that allows the motor to go into a state of intake
valve float (soft backfires that blow open the intake valve, potentially
catestrophic if it contacts the piston).

Using stock carbs, I have encountered sudden freeway misfires from this in hot
weather, where there's sort of soft pinging power loss all of a sudden with
the stock carb, it feels like vapor lock induced lean misfires even or intake
valves floating due to mixture going off as it hits the backside of hot intake
valves or flashing of fuel before the valves can close.   With the big carb,
you get lots of early warning pings if you are getting your heads too hot but
never the misfires/vapor lock/dreaded intake valve float.

You know, just now I have the idea it's because the larger mainfold and 2-brl
venturis can dissipitate/vent intake manifold backpressure during pinging, due
to expansion into greater volume of the manifold and finally backwards out the
big carb instead venturis instead of building up to where it floats intake
valves.  Stock manifolds and carbs tend to be restrictive enough to build up
intake flash-induced pressure that can float the intake valves.

I run mid-grade gas as much as I can in both cars but use all premium when I
plan to drive fast with a trailer or into the mountains.   I used to run the
stock muffler as much as I could with the bigger carb setup.  The problems I
had were related to continuous blowing out the lower muffler connection (clamp
over the doughnut setup) so I finally welded on the brackets to make lower
connection using same gaskets as upper connection.  This somewhat cramps my
ability to just pick my next muffler without consideration that I will have to
spend about $40 on welding the required brackets onto my next muffler or
header.  Am running some occasional lead substitute for summer mountain
driving or towing, due to direct experience of exhaust valve seat wear without
it.

The stock carb setup allows better reliablity when you use the stock muffler,
preserving the lower clamps better with lower exhaust back pressure despite
the restriction of the muffler (intake gets controled by the backpressure more
than the backpressure is raised by the stock muffler itself, see?  It's lower
top end power loss to control the back pressure, evidenced by the difference
of 5 hp and top speed going down as well as backpressure)  but that brings
more heat into the head instead of out the muffler, albeit regulating the rate
of intake flow and potential heat,  the heat moves upstream and although it
must be less overall, it heats up intake valves.

Even with the stock muffler on my 2brl engine, while I had more lean burn
damage to the exhaust valves due to the power I had less damage to the intake
valves and heads did not crack like it used to using the stock carbs that have
the lean running problems.

&gt; i bet $1000 that you have more success removing the flat spot by
&gt; getting a used STOCK vacuum advance distributor.  try a salvage yard,
&gt; local they are like $10-15.  much cheaper and faster than messing with
&gt; your jets..(which you can still do later if you want)
&gt;
&gt; find out which distributor you need, i have boxes of them...i might
&gt; have one you need.

&gt; **also get rid of the points.  electronic ign is the only way to go if
&gt; your engine is not stock, which yours isn't.  they cost about $50 or
&gt; less and you NEVER NEVER NEVER need to set the points, or timing
&gt; again.  not only that but the engine will run smoother and cleaner
&gt; cause the timing will stay DEAD ON FOREVER!!!!!
