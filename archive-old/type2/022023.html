Hi Jason,

There are to my knowledge 3 types of red light relating 
to brakes; those that come on with the ignition, go off 
with engine running except when you have brake 
failure; those that come on when the ignition and hand 
brake are on; and thirdly those that you can push to 
test and come on when you have brake failure.

But yours doesn't behave exactly like any of those.

Certainly you should check the brake fluid reservoir on 
a '69 it will be behind one of kick panels - thats 
the 'fibre board' panels just in front of you feet when 
you sit in the cab. It will be a small opaque bottle that 
you will be able to see the fluid level through. Should be 
at least 3/4 full.

If you go under then van take a look at the brake 
master cylinder which is directly to the rear of the brake 
pedal to see if there are signs of leakage follow the 
pipes to each wheel looking for signs of seepage and 
take a good look at the inner side of each wheel for 
signs of seepage of brake fluid too.

If necessary jack up each wheel to see if one still turns 
when the brake pedal is pushed.

Report what you find, and I'm sure the brake experts 
will assist

Good Luck

&gt;What's that red &quot;B&quot; dash light for again?
&gt;
&gt;Brakes?
&gt;
&gt;And when you press it, should it go on? like testing it? 
Mine doesn't go on 
&gt;when I press it.
&gt;
&gt;BUT
&gt;
&gt;It went on the other day, and stayed on. But while I'm 
press the brakes, it 
&gt;goes off.
&gt;
&gt;I don't have a manual to check what the heck I should 
do, I just got the 
&gt;bus.
&gt;
&gt;Low brake fluid?
&gt;
&gt;I'm not driving the bus until I find out.
