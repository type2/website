Subject: Bus at Ryan's

Howdy.
Yeah, it's Monday. Not Friday. I saw green, post-1973 
North Carolina bus at Ryan's in Crossville, TN today.
It was one of those days that you forget it was
raining and leave your lights on, even though it's
broad daylight. I was the weirdo that came in and
asked the Ryan's waitress to announce, &quot;Attention: The
owner of the Volkswagen bus has left their lights on.&quot;
I just kind of wondered if you were on the list,
whoever you are. You may have been heading back from
the big show in Manchester... hmmmm? Just didn't want
you to run down your battery like I have on days like
those...
