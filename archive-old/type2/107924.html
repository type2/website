Subject: AFM Replacement

Hi gang,

I've been coping with minor, intermittent stumbling and poor idle (Temp
Sensor II checks out OK). This only occurs when the engine is hot and left
to sit for 15-20 minutes and then restarted. Since it always stumbles at the
same point in the shift range, I'm suspecting the AFM. I know mine is old
and it has obviously been disassembled by a PO. Two questions...

If a marginal AFM sits in a hot engine compartment for a while after
shutdown, might the heat aggravate it enough to cause these problems to
occur on startup?

Thee are several AFM's available at BD. Anyone had experience with OEM,
non-OEM, or rebuilt?

Thanks,
Rick
