Subject: 110 - 12v power converters

The following was posted to another site I visit once in a while (not VW
related), but I thought I'd forward it since it may be of some interest to
people with VW campers.  These are units that recharge the vehicle battery
off of AC power (similar to, but more heavy duty than, the setup used on
'76-79 Deluxe Westies).  Wired into the electrical inlet on a Westy, this
would allow you to automatically recharge your battery while camping at a
site that has 110v hookups (particularly useful if you have one of those
power-hungry 12v-only fridges found on late 70's Westies and late 80's
Multivans, or an aftermarket 12v coolbox).

I'm not selling these, just passing the info along.

---------------------------------------------------

This is a hot deal only if you own a recreational vehicle and want to
replace the power converter with an automatic one that won't boil the
batteries over if you leave it plugged in too long. Progressive Dynamics
makes about the best automatic converters. They are offering remanufactured
ones at substantially less than new ones cost.

Best part is right now they are out of the 40 amp ones (PD9140R) and will
substitute a 55 amp converter (PD9155R) for the same price as the 40 amp.
The PD9155R is not listed on their web page, but they will offer it if you
call them. A new one from an RV dealer would be $300 or more.
