Maybe I scared people by saying guru wanted.  Let
me edit that request to say &quot;anyone who has
successfully completed the procedure&quot;, especially
if you happen to have a similar bus to look at
and tell me a few things.  

Thanks for offering.  I will call you tomorrow.

Peace and blessings,
