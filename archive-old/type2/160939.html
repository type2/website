Subject: Re: [T2] Re: Cooling tin photos needed

I see the ground. It had a piece of sheet metal with huge gaps all around
the engine and hung with clothesline which I removed  because it was
obviously doing little if anything to keep the engine cool. All of the
cooling tins on the bottom of the engine are gone except the diverter above
the pushrod tubes. The PO PAID someone to screw things up this bad. I am
trying to find an early bay engine tin to adapt to the late body. Then I
have to figure out a way to get heat into it, but I will have to replace the
fan shroud and the exhausts as there is no ducting or heat exchangers. I am
just about to the point of saying the heck with it and pulling the 2.0 with
all the tin out of another bus and putting the correct engine back in, but
that seems to be an overwhelming task. Yet, the 1600 has a fresh rebuild
with only a few hundred miles on it. It runs strong so I hate not to use it.
Since this is my first running bus I am feeling my way along in the dark
trying to get a handle on what it is I need to do to make it right.

&gt; Are you able to seal around the engine in the engine bay, or do you see
&gt; the
&gt; ground?  This would be just as critical, for you will be sucking hot air
&gt; from the motor back into the engine if this is not sealed up.  I did not
&gt; see
&gt; a post that said you had used the type 4 to type 1 conversion
&gt; tin................or if you have a European bus with a type 1 motor in
&gt; it.
