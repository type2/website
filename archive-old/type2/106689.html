Subject: Re: Bilge blower Conversion Questions

From: &quot;Casting Fool&quot; &lt;jester_at_cfnson_dot_com&gt;

&gt;1. Would the engine fan provide enough pressure to keep the system at a
&gt;positive pressure when the blower is off?

As my South GA relations would say, oh, hayull yayus.  That's the stock scenario, basically....with flaps closed, part of the cooling air pressure goes 
out of the fan shroud and leaks out through various planned and unplanned holes in heat exchanger/hose setup: leaky sheet metal on heat 
exchangers, bad hoses, etc.

&gt;and 2. Is the blower going to need a air backflow preventer to keep the
&gt;engine fan from blowing air back up through the blower (if installed in the
&gt;tire well)?

The systems I've seen just completely segregated the two, or else you'd need one if you were tee'ing in the blower outlet into, say, the paper hoses.  
Stock blowers on &gt;71's have one-way flaps that would take care of that, IIRC.

But when I think of an upstream bilge blower I'm making the assumption that the outlets on the fan shroud for the paper hoses would just be blocked 
off completely.

Isn't that basically what a pancake's setup is?  Fan cools engine, blower pushes air over heat exchangers for heating, and never the twain shall 
meet?
