Subject: 75 Bus Breaks

I have had my Bus for about six months now and the time has come to put on new
breaks.  The Bently book shows the rear breaks have two shoe retainting pins,
two  springs and two spring cups per side.  When I removed the worn shoes the
parts were not there.  So I did not put them in when I reinstalled the new
shoes.  The shoes have the holes for the pins, but the back up plates do not. 

Now I am starting to wonder if I need these or not.
