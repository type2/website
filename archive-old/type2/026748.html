I thought about doing the same thing. I purchased a bus in Arizona and
thought about driving all the way to VA. I decided against it and it was the
smart move. The gas tank has a lot of crude in it and it needed to be
flushed. This crude had worked its way through the fuel filter, carb filter
and into the carb, it really clogged it up. I would have only lasted about
250 miles before I would have needed to clean the carb out and replace all
filters. 

I used a shipping company to transport my bus. It was to far for me to drive
out and back.

Roger,

I towed my 78 Westy from Dallas to Augusta, GA behind a 4.0l Jeep Cherokee.
I used a tow bar bolted *thru* the front bumper.  I set c/c _at_ 70MPH the
whole way (with a tranny oil cooler) with nary a problem.  In fact, I didn't
even drop the axles on the VW to prevent *possible* tranny damage - brought
her home, started the resto, and everything was just fine!

I suspect from your post that you'd rather not try a cross-country on your
first trip in a Bus.  Of course, some of the appeal of VWs is learning the
hard way - on the side of the road...but, consider parts, tools, etc.  I
recommend towing - learning in the comfort of your garage/shop - and *then*
tearing-off on a long trip.  Just my .02

Cheers
