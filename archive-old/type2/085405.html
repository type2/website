Subject: Re: [T2] Brake Vacuum Line

Tyler sends:

&gt; I have heard a couple people talking about brake
&gt; vacuum lines that go to the engine. My 74 currrently
&gt; has a dp beetle motor and am wondering where to attach
&gt; the vacuum line would go to. I noticed that it is hard
&gt; to brake and figures that this might be the problem.

It goes to the intake manifold, right below the carb. The port is halfway
between the carburetor and the siameser that splits the intake out to the
heads.

The simplest way to do this is to start hitting junkyards. The piece you
need is the center section of the manifold off an autostick Bug. The control
valve for the Bug autostick runs on vacuum; hook the brake vacuum line to
this port, clamp it good and you're in business.

Alternate means: find someone who's got a Bug converted from autostick to
manual but still has the autostick manifold, and trade him manifold center
sections.
