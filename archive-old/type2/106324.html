Subject: Re: [T2] Out of Gas!

&gt; I remember something about the FI system causing trouble if it's run
&gt; completely dry.  Is this just my overactive imagination, or is there
&gt; anything I should worry about when I finally get back to my Bus and try to
&gt; get it started again?  I imagine it'll be a little sluggish starting, but
&gt; I'm hoping I can just fill it and go.

I think the real proablem is with new cars. The fuel pump is submerged in
the tank and is cooled by the gas. Running it dry can kill the pump.
