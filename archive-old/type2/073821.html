Subject: Re: [T2] Bumper Removal on '75 Van

Paul
I agree with Karl,, use liquid wrench, but be careful with the bracket to frame
bolts in a rust prone area,, they may snap off... 

If you can leave the brackets on the Van, and just remove the bumper to bracket
bolts, you can break them and buy new ones,, and no fiddling with the captive
nuts in the frame

there are 4 on each side, 2 on top of bumper and 2 below

Jamie Rivers



&gt; &gt; I assume that the bumper is held on by the 4 bolts on the bumper stems. 


&gt; WD 40 sucks as a rust buster......it was designed for water dispersal, not a
&gt; penetrent. Get a real penetrent like Liquid Wrench.
&gt; 
&gt; Not sure which bolts/nuts you are trying to remove. You should be unbolting it
&gt; where the brackets bolt to the frame. Two bolts on each side going up into the
&gt; frame.
&gt; If I remember right, they are 17mm headed bolts. Yes, they will be tight.
