The symptom I neglected to mention was that there was no spark when I
connected the new (fully-charged) battery.  This leads me to believe
that there's very little if any drain when not running.  The obvious
drains are the clock and the LEDs.  Given no spark, I have real
trouble handling the idea that there's enough drain to pull it down to
yellow within ten minutes of shutting down after a half-hour drive.
