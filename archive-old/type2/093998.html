&gt; hey listees, I've about pulled my remaining hair out trying to figure 
&gt; out why my truck gets such poor mileage. (about 10-15)  It's a 1/7L 
&gt; type IV with dual weber 34 ICT's.  I've tried 3 different jet sizes and 
&gt; have finally settled on one that makes it run better than the other 2 
&gt; but it still gets lousy mileage.  It came with 55's, I tried 45's (that 
&gt; made it buck like mad upon acceleration).  I finally put 50's in it and 
&gt; it runs great, but still poor mileage...  it has an electric fuel pump 
&gt; on it although I don't know the brand or any of the particulars.  
&gt; Should I try putting a fuel pressure regulator on it to see if that 
&gt; helps?  tia,  greg
