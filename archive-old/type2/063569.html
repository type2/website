&gt;now, what i'm wondering, anyone done a cross country trip/move with said cat
&gt;and constructed kitty box in a westy somewhere...if so...how it work out?

        Not a westy (this was before I installed the westy interior), but I
went from LA (CA) to Austin in my '70 with 1 cat (male), 1 rat snake
(female), and 8 rats (assorted breeders). Just put the cat box in an open
space, and he found it just fine. He even got used to driving after the
first day, and spent the last 900 miles on my lap. Except in the hill
country of Texas, where he decided to explore the front windshield. The
first day, however, he complained-loudly and with utter abandon-and crapped
all over himself. Yuck. Couldn't camp that night, had to get a motel. $$$.
Bummer.
        If you get the cat used to driving, keep it up. I didn't and he now
hates driving just as much as before, and usually relieves himself enroute.
:-( Smells bad...

Peace,
