Hi,

Barely a couple of miles after heading off for the annual Tadoussac VW bus
pilgrimage, and still in stop &amp; go traffic in Montreal, the engine stalled
and wouldn't start again. Checked ignition dwell and that was fine, CDI is
whistling normally, but from the sound of the engine turning over (easily
and evenly), I guess there's no fuel going to the carbs. Indeed the spark
plugs were dry. However, the fuel pump is humming and there are no kinks in
the fuel hoses.  Any ideas, anyone?

Merci,

Sami

PS: It's a dual carb setup on a 911 engine, although I don't think that
should matter.
