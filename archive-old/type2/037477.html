Subject: erraticTach -from VDO

I had this problem at one time -- VDO sent me the following
-- this circut took the noise out of line and made my tach smooth.


(1) Purchase a diode #1N4005 from your local electronics store i.e. Radio
Shack.

(2) Cut both ends of the diode so each is approx. ¾ inch long.

(3) Crimp ¼ inch female spade connector on the end of the diode with the
silver band.
(4) Crimp butt-splice connector on the other end of the diode.
(5) Crimp the opposite end of butt-splice connector to the wire connected to
ignition signal source.
(6) Connect ¼ in female spade connector used in #3 above to terminal #4 on
the back of the tachometer.
(7) Attach a ground (-) wire to terminal #3.
(8) Attach a switched 12-volt Power wire to terminal #2.
(9) Set switches for the appropriate amount of cylinders.
