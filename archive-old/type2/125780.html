Subject: Re: [T2] Re: Replacing battery tray

Hi Nik,

 If you're in a real pinch you can cut a piece of plywood to fit the space. This
is what I've done until I can get the new tray welded in place.

 I bought my replacement tray from the bus depot, it was fairly cheap.

HTH,
Harry


*&gt; | Rusted out battery tray, just realized that my battery falling through to
*&gt; | the ground below is a real possibility.  I have a buddy who is a welder,
*&gt; | thinking I need to buy him some beer.  Where would I get a replacement
*&gt; | piece?  Any scrap metal acceptable?  Thanks folks.
