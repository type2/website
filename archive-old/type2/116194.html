Subject: NEW Door handles for sale.

Hey guys,

	I ordered a set of new door handles for my Bus a month ago. As it
turns out, I have decided not to use them. Plain and simple, it's not
possible for me to re-key them to work with my other locks. I found a set of
good condition OEM door handles from another Bus and have decided to use
those. I'm going to have a list member re-key them for me.

So I'm offering them up for sale or trade. They are the ones sold on
Wolfsberg West... Part# 211837205N, $20.96 each.
The two that I have have a matching set of keys. 

I'll sell them both together for $40. I'll pay for shipping. Or, if you want
to trade them, I'm looking for a set of two GOOD tail-lights. I just need
the lenses, they need not be cracked, or faded.


Thanks!
