Subject: Interior panels for '62 23-Window?

Hi.  We've recently purchased a 1962 23-Window deluxe
in which the original interior panels had been replaced
with some home-made panels which we'd like to replace
with some higher quality panels.

We've seen ads for panels in the WCM and Wolfsburg West
catalogs (some of which won't fit a deluxe it seems) and
have heard that Rocky Mountain Motor Works has some in
their catalog too.  

We'd like to hear from others who have used any of these
replacement panels so as to decide the best way to go.
It is a significant investment - so we'd like to make
the best choice the first time around.

Any comments/advice would be appreciated.

Brian and Stephanie
