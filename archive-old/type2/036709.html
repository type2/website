Subject: Backfire Questions

Can a backfire be *caused* by an extractor exhaust? I've temporarily got
cheap non-stock exhaust on the bus. I had a cheapie muffler on there, but
it started eating itself from the inside out and I was getting popcorn
noises on decelleration. I put an extractor-style muffler on there
(cheapest thing that would fit) and it seems even worse than the holey
muffler was.

I did find that my points were burnt...which in itself is some cause for
concern, since these have only about 700 miles on them. I picked up a new
set, but haven't installed them. Could it be the burnt points?

I've investigated the archives and library, but the gems on backfiring
don't seem to answer my questions exactly, so I'm appealing to the list.

Thanks! Joe
