Subject: Re: [T2] Aftermarkey wheels for a Bay

&gt; &gt; FWIW, 2 mos ago I installed a set of 225/75/15s and NOW my speedo is nutz
&gt; &gt; on, it always read too fast with the stock tires!
&gt;
&gt; right, the speedo is on the front left wheel the power is to the rear two
&gt; wheels, they are not really related, a tach would be more useful as would
&gt; a vacuum guage...

Im kind of assuming that these tires are on all 4 wheels.
In which case they are related.
