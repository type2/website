Subject: Cold in the Ol' Type II This Time of Year?  ('84 Westfalia FS)

With all this rainy weather, it sure is nice having these fog-free
windows and TWO heaters blowing nice, warm air while I drive around in my
1984 Vanagon GL Westfalia - which just happens to be for sale...or trade
for a nice 1975-79 Deluxe Westy...

Interested?  See:
