Subject: '71 with intermittant starting problems...

I volks- If it is from cold, check the ground strap on the gearbox/tranny to
chassis- I had a problem with this a while back- the strap was broken. This
was intermittent and always the first start- afterwards it was OK. I replaced
the strap and the problem disappeared. Another common thing is the &quot;hot start&quot;
problem but this is well documented in the archives- one solution is to
install a relay so that the power to the starter solenoid goes directly from
the battery and not up to the ignition switch  and back. I did this fix so if
you want info' pmail me and I'll be glad to help out.

&lt;We have a standard '71 that only starts when it feels like it.  Turn the
key, you get gas gauge, other dash activation, but no turn over, no
click even.  When it does start, it turns and immediately starts like a
champ (just installed a new starter).  I am guessing bad battery cables&gt;
