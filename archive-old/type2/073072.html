&gt;Have you ever seen a tool truck (Snap-On or Mac) with a roof AC unit and
&gt;the generator running?  Around here, they leave the generator and AC on all
&gt;the time, on the road, or parked at a business.  Why can't I do that with
&gt;our '76 Westy?

Well, realistically, how many nights per year are you going to run the AC
while camping? A dozen maybe?

Why not install &quot;regular&quot; AC ala Mr. Schwarze, which solves your problem
while driving; and if you want AC on while camping, just leave the bus
idling all night. Think of it as a two-liter genset. It would be less
economical per hour than a real genset but given the very low expected
usage of this system it seems far less expensive than the trailer-mounted
extravaganza you're thinking about. =^ )
