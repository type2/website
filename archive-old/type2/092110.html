Subject: Re: [T2] Further info Re: [T2] 72 Westy trouble...

jimt;
   I just heard from her (and so there's no confusion, the Kathy in my
e-mail sig is NOT the Kathy having problems). She's headed home and will
not have net access until 4:00 p.m. CST tomorrow, but is looking up a
list of questions I sent her.(Engine #, carbs etc.) She has no apparent
mechanical knowlege of VW's as far as I can tell and the local (Port
Aransas) mechanics are of no help whatsoever, which is strange since
there's a VW dune buggy rental outfit there. I'm trying to help out,
AIRS style, from about 160 miles away, so that bit is tricky. If anybody
on the list is anywhere near Port Aransas, Texas and could help out, let
me know and I'll pass the information along.

   My thoughts are along jimt's list of possibilities as well, but we'll
just have to see what she comes up with.

&gt; She stated she could restart the engine.
&gt; 
&gt; The problem is that from what she was describing it could be the engine
&gt; was just cutting out which could lead to bad indications on the dash.
&gt;   I would first start the engine and verify i had oil pressure.
&gt; then the basics after looking for  loose connections in the engine bay.
&gt; if you have a meter verify alternator output.
&gt; 
&gt; 1.  fuel filter
&gt; 2.  ignition coil, points, condenser, plugs
&gt; if plugs are severely fouled, comp check the cylinders.  If just
&gt; severely worn because nobody has replaced them since the engine was put
&gt; in, replace them and still continue wit the rest of this list
&gt; 3.  fuel pump(if you can verify pressure)  If not start engine and
&gt; verify that you get a steady running and no pulsating noises, or
&gt; extremely noisy.
&gt; 4.  air cleaner
&gt; these are all items that can be bad and still get a started engine but
&gt; no run under load.
