Subject: RE: [T2] Hagerty Insurance

I too had the same problem when I tried to get insured. I tried to add 
insurance to my 73 VW Bus, and also to my 1987 Fiero SE / V6 and I was denied 
for both. They basically just said that they don't insure them. Unfortunately, 
unless it's something like a hot rod, or a custom vehicle... the &quot;classic&quot; 
notion is more on their own perception. They were MORE than happy to insure my 
1981 special edition Trans Am (smokey &amp; the bandit style II T/A), but they 
never responded to any of my e-mails on the Bus or the Fiero. And when I did 
finally call them they just stated that they didn't insure them.

Oh well... I just have all my cars insured by Geico and hope that I never get 
in a crash! heheh.. cause otherwise I'll get blue book value...

&gt;
&gt;I tried to get classic car insurance on my '71. Got the same response from 
&gt;all of them, sorry we can't insure campers. So I called rv insurance... &quot;we 
&gt;can't insure air-cooled vehicles.&quot;
&gt;Even if I had been able to get the classic car insurance, it's only good for 
&gt;5k miles/year. I drive 10k just on camping trips in the summer.
&gt;So I had to add the bus to my regular insurance. But they told me that in 
&gt;the event of a claim, even with full coverage, they can only give me book 
&gt;value on the bus. Which is far less than a classic of 35 years like it is. 
&gt;So I just got liability and a big fire extinguisher.
