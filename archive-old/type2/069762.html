Subject: Re: Headliner advice needed

I need to put a new headliner in the '64 21-window.  Does anyone 
know a source for a NOS or aftermarket repro in the correct light 
green for a Como Green interior?

never heard of one.   :(   i think you may be S. O. L.

(please tell me im wrong)

btw, i saw a standard model 64 turquoise and white double door microbus that
had a very nice original headliner in it.    i love that interior.   :)
