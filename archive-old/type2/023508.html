Subject: Organizing Wires Under Dash
To: type2_at_type2_dot_com

Hello everyone...I remember sometime back someone had a great web site 
showing how to organize the rat nest of wires under the dash(around the fuse 
box)--if someone could pass along the URL or offer advice that would be 
great! Thanks alot---Adam
