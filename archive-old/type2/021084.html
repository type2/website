Subject: '77 Weirdness

Here's one for the *real* experts...

Bleu, a '77 ASI has been acting weird lately.  Start her up and she
fires right off.  Then immediately dies.  Might restart, might not. 
Supposing she does restart, you can drive for 50' then she dies again. 
A little misfire on occasion.

She has new plugs, points, condensor and cap (but not a new $36 rotor.) 
New fuel pump and filter. Fresh oil, filter and valve adjustment. Timing
and dwell is spot on, fuel pressure is nominal.

This was a problem last summer that put me at the side of the road 500
miles from home.  Don't know what fixed it then, don't know what's
causing it to happen now.  It acts like a loose connection somewhere,
but the question is what connection?

Any thoughts?
