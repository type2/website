Subject: I am looking for two dual-port heads
Message-ID: &lt;d1da27a3.24565262_at_aol_dot_com&gt;

I'm restoring a 1600cc engine, and when I tore it down, both heads were 
cracked, so I need to replace them.   If anybody has some or can tell me 
where a good place to find them cheap, it'd be nice.  Please note, I am 
looking for non-hellicoiled  heads. 

Thanks
