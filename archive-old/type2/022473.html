Anybody out in the San Fran area ever see this bus???


Owner/builder of the &quot;Radio Flyer&quot; mobil which
             is a 1970 VW microbus that has been converted
             into a Ham-Shack-On-Wheels.

             The Flyer is painted red &amp; white with the &quot;Radio
             Flyer&quot; logo on both sides. The rear seating has
             been removed and a operating consol now
             dominates the interior. The Flyer's engine is a
             computerized 200 HP 3.8 litre fuel injected
             Oldsmobil V6. The Radio Flyer carries an
             articulated 40' crank-up tower in a custom
             made roof rack. Out-riggers are fitted to provide
             a stable operating platform. The Flyer carries a
             2.4 KVA generator (for the high power R.F.
             amplifiers) and has 2 12V electrical systems.
             Also into Motorcycles &amp; large displacement R/C
             Model aircraft &amp; Helicopters.
