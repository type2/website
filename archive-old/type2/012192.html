Subject: [T2] White Exhaust Smoke
X-Diagnostic: MESSAGE REQUIRES APPROVAL

This may or may not help. I was having the same type of
problem with my 74. So after a lot of trying to figure it
out I decided to just go through the tune up stuff one at a
 time.
  I popped the Dist. cap off and found the ground strap had
fatigued. I was getting contact but it was poor as it was
just laying there.
 Made and installed a new one and it hasnt happened since.

&gt; The bus is running beautifully, but I am having a problem
&gt; with white exhaust
&gt; smoke. The smoke appears when I start the bus and the
&gt; engine is already
&gt; warm. Stop at the store, go in, get a couple of things,
&gt; come back out and
&gt; fire her up. Poof, big cloud of white smoke. It doesn't
&gt; happen when the
&gt; motot is cold.

because he is not infected with the concept of what I &quot;should&quot; be doing.
