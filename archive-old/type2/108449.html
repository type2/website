&lt;And we know at the very least that one day his karma will run over his own
dogma.&gt;
That's a good one. You know, all these years, I've been buying and selling
vehicles without the &quot;help&quot; of lawyers. Caveat Emptor, it is up to you to
check this vehicle out before buying it. Lots of people say lots of untrue
things about things they want to sell, whether from malice or sheer
ignorance or no morals, or all of the above. It's a tough world out there,
that's why we test drive vehicles, take them for safety checks and
mechanic's opinions, lie under them and have  a look around under them.
This is your job, not the seller's. To the devil with lawyers.

&lt; We tried talking thru it with the guy as well as mediation neither worked.
We don't like going the litigation route to solve this or any other
problem, but it's our last resort.
And we know at the very least that one day his karma will run over his
own dogma.

Anyway, if anyone has other leads on Volks who are lawyers, or just a
lawyer who you had a good experience with would be appreciated.
Thanks,
