Wow.  Well, I've got some spare PPs that were replaced with some life 
left in 'em - maybe I'll spend the weekend swapping clutch parts until 
I find a happy combination.  Yeesh.

&gt; ps. If you are considering using the T/O from CB check on which one it 
&gt; is.

Will do - thanks.  I had one from the FLAPS I bought when a stock one 
gave way, and it worked fine - bought it about 5 years ago.  It was 
gold.

I'm bummed at what a PITA it is to figure out *what* is causing this 
(TO, PP, shaft) since ya gotta yank the engine every time.  Another 
thing I'm gonna try is to reuse an older TOB from my spares box that 
IIRC was only slightly noisy, and has a different housing (same round 
mounting ears).
