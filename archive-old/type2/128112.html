&gt; That is the exact vehicle I was thinking about. It is small, but reminds me a
&gt; lot of my bus.  Small, square, stripped down, a fair amount of space. Of
&gt; course it has no camper package, but it is a cool little ride for $14,000.

Not just small, very small!  It is shorter than a Beetle.  Huge interior
though, with ample room for four adults to ride in comfort.

The price is more like $15500 after taxes.

The xB is a good substitute for our beetle, but it is nowhere as large
inside as our bus.

For sheer interior volume, a bus is impossible to beat with today's safety
regs.
