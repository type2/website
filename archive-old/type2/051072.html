Subject: Re: [T2] ECU price

&gt; I found a 79 at a local Junk yard and pulled some spare parts -switches,
&gt; sliding door parts ..... one other thing I pulled was the ECU. The guy
&gt; wanted $50 for it - so I passed. Should I have bought it? What are they
&gt; worth. Also is compatibility a problem? My Buss VIN starts with 2291 and
so
&gt; does this bus.

229 does not mean they are the same. There are 4 different ECU's for 79. 2
for Fed version, 039 906 021D for manual trans and 039 906 021E for
autotrans. 2 for Calif version, 039 906 021 B for manual trans and 039 906
021 C for auto trans.
Save your money, they are darn near bullet-proof. In the past 5 years I have
only seen one ECU fail....water got in it.
