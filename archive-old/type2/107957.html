Subject: Re: [VB] New name for AIRS????

Hmmm...  Squad . With over 1800 members, that's over battalion size.
So shouldn't it be Aircooled International Rescue 'Battalion&quot;??

DUCK

&gt; Hey guys, quick poll.
&gt;
&gt; Seeing how AIRS has been worldwide for quite sometime, and is about to hit
the 2000 member mark,
&gt; what does everyone think about calling it Aircooled International Rescue
Squad, instead of Aircooled
&gt; Interstate Rescue Squad? A couple foreign members brought it to my
attention that they dont have
&gt; states, and dont have Interstate highways. They do have a point. It doesnt
have quite the same ring
&gt; to it but it is more applicable.
&gt;
&gt; Just a thought, what do you think?
&gt;
&gt; AIRS now has over 1800 members and has some cool features planned for it,
including but not limited
&gt; to a possible WAP database as well as a Searchable Database.
