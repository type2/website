Well I'll tell ya, there are some things in life that are simply mysterious.
One minute your driving down the road and the next minute your dead because
an interstate overpass decided to fall.  So goes life.

No worries, I did not get dropped upon by an overpass and the Mother is
doing fine.  She does have a mysterious problem though that happened a
couple hours ago.  

I was driving along enjoying my 2/65 air conditioning and watching the
scenery of southern Georgia ease by my window.  Suddenly, out of the clear
blue she just shuts off.

The excess fuel in the system backfired out the rear which I imagine cleaned
my plugs pretty nicely.  After I drifted to a stop on the apron of the
highway I tried to restart.  She turns over well but just cranks and cranks
and cranks....she does not start.

I tapped on the fuel filter to see if I could possible shake the possible
debris loose.  No go.

Now....what could this be?  To be honest it could be most anything and so I
will begin my journey through the operating system of my bus tomorrow.

My strategy to search out said problem will be thus:

1.  I will take out my trusty Bentley manual and my latest playboy (for the
better pictures).  I will also have some water with me because it is so damn
hot.  

2.  Points, condensor, rotor, and cap.

3.  Check coil

4.  Check Fuel filter and fuel pump. (I figure thats what it is)

5.  Check voltage regulator

6.  Check all the wiring

So what are ya'll thinking?  Any checks I am forgetting to check with my
check points?


Thanks for tolerating the lack of ramblings,
Charlie Ford
