&gt; Where would one look for a water tank and pump?

I was out at German Auto Salvage in Boring(yes that is a real town for you
non native Oregonians) just yesterday. They have at least two 75's in the
yard. One I know has the water tank.


&gt; If the fridge needs a leisure battery, then all I need (besides the
&gt; battery) is an isolator, right? That and replace the wires from the trunk
&gt; to the fridge OC.

I have seen an isolator system but stock it was wired through a relay. These
relay systems can be bought at any RV store or several on line vendors. Bus
Depot I know has them.

&gt; Assuming that said leisure battery and isolator was installed, couldn't I
&gt; then add an inverter and run the electric heater on 110AC?

Running an invertor would drain the auxiliary in no time flat.


&gt; I have never understood how the aux blower for the stock heater system
&gt; works. Having more than two wires, I assume that it needs some information
&gt; to start functioning, what it exactly does it need to know and where does
&gt; it get this information from?

The right red lever starts the fan when pushed all the way down. How its
wired Im not sure. I'll take a look at mine.


&gt; Portland OR type2ers:
&gt; Anybody up for Sat/Sunday cafe meet? My girlfriend is getting sick of my
&gt; Veedub talk. I usually go to Stumptown on Division or Mojos coffee Den on
&gt; SE Stark,  and if anyone wants to meet up and shoot the poo email me and
&gt; well set a time.

I'm in Milwaukie. Set a time for some Sunday and I'm there. We can compare
wiring ; )
