Subject: Heater Boxes (exhaust)

  I'm looking thru this aircraft supply catalog.

 I was actually going to sell them some stuff but I came across this
thing they call a &quot;Heat Muff&quot;. Price $109 ea. right or left.

 What it is is a piece of tubing with one inlet and outlet or one in and two
out. Hinged full length to go over a home built airplane
exhaust pipe. Fits anywhere you have 12' of 1-3/4 straight pipe.
 Has baffles to slow the air flow and increase the heat.

 &quot;Use for cabin heat or carb or both. Offset to clear most cowlings 
etc. 

 Made from 6061-t4 aluminum. Have to insulate the pup.

 Right with it is a heat box for the fire wall with a baffle to open
or close. Looks like a fan may be mounted in it but makes no mention
of same. The heat box is another $76

  This has some great possibilities for say a &quot;J-pipe&quot; set-up.

 In the same wish book is the &quot;Red Dragon Preheater&quot;. $290

 This is uses LP or propane and turns out 49,000 btu.
 12 volt . Includes all the ginger bread but the tank.

 That ought to warm the &quot;Splitty&quot; pretty quick in the morning.

 Some one was asking about &quot;Halon&quot; fire extinguishers for his &quot;heavy
and expensive electronics&quot; These are the ones that leave no residue.

 They have them.  Shelf life of 20 years. 3.5 lb is $120

 Not unreasonable considering.

 There's another whole world out there ladies!
