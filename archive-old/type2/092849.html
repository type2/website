Subject: Re: [T2] looking for a used dual carb linkage


&gt;im looking to buy a linkage kit, complete or not, used, for dual dellorto
&gt;drla 40 on  a type 4 engine
&gt;
&gt;Else, anyone can point me out the right kit on CB performance?  its seems
&gt;they have many kits, offset intake manifold or not... well all intake
&gt;manifold on type 4 are offset no? the passenger side is closer from the back
&gt;in about 1-2 inches.

I bought their linkage way back in 1995 and it is wonderful. I used it for 
36mm Dells on a Type IV in a Beetle.

I am told that this is a copy of the Type III carb linkage.

Take a look at the VW part, maybe it will be perfect.

Much of the aftermarket stuff is pretty flexy I am told.


Ciao!
