&gt; &gt; I think now I understand what Rich meant by &quot;dead spots&quot; in a steering

&gt;
&gt; Remember the grease I pointed out to you apparently leaking out of the
&gt; steering box?
&gt;
&gt; And no, your efforts with the pin are NOT in vain! You saw what yours
&gt; was doing. Now get the wifey to turn the steering wheel back and forth
&gt; while you look at and admire your newly solid swing lever that doesn't
&gt; pop up!
&gt;
&gt; Glad you finally got it together. Tell us how it drives in crosswinds!

Thanks for the epat-on-the-back. But like I said, I still think that the
steering is going to be sloppy due to the dead spots in the steering box.
For all I know, the steering box has been the culprit all along.

But as soon as I get done with the wedding I am going to today, I will
finish up, take it for a drive and let you all know if there is any
difference.

Now I just need to get that shift bushing and steering damper and I will at
least have one project (or rather 2) done.
