I have often wondered why someone with a great deal more money than
me hasn't repaired a bay or splittie body to perfection and used it to make
fiberglass
molds for new fiberglass bodies. No rust and the light weight would increase
accelleration and fuel mileage. Judging from going price of a restored
splittie, I
bet there would be a lot of interest in a fiberglass reproduction.

&gt; I want a bus made out of the same stuff as those Little Tykes cars are
&gt; made of.  That stuff is indestructable.  I could drive by Braille.  :)
&gt;
&gt; At BBBX, there were a few guys with Bays that they had painted with pickup
&gt; bed liner material.  Looked pretty darned good and it was extremely
&gt; scratch resistant.  Nice bright colors, too.  You have to get into the
&gt; texture, though.
