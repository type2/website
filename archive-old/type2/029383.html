hi all,

My 3k mile road trip in my bus is finished.  Last i checked in here i was
in galveston headed to florida. Now i am back in St. Louis, MO bemoaning
that my english composition skills are not up to the task of describing my
journey, but i shall give it a go nonetheless.

from galveston i tried to remain as close to the gulf coast of the united
states as i possibly could taking the &quot;blue highways&quot; that paralell the
waters edge.  In most places teh water is really not close enough to see
but in the places where it was WOW is that a pretty drive.  The most
memorable bits of the journey were driving through downtown new orleans in
mid-mardi-gras.  The traffic was nuts, i saw floats making their way down
to the main parade area, people with baloons all over their cars, and a 7
or so car pile up.  I elected not to stop and am kind of glad i did, i am
getting a bit too old and mellow for all that craziness.

also driving along the mississippi gulf coast was great.  Miles and miles
of pretty beaches right next to the highway.  I made very poor time
because i kept stopping just to drink in the view.

the best by far was the coast of florida near pensacola.  Wow.  I have
been to the carribean and the water and beaches here are the closest ive
ever seen to that beauty in the US.  The sand was pure white, the water
was bright blue, and yet so clear that the bottom was plainly visible.  I
highly recommend this area.  Friendly people too.

The rest of the drive had its moments but was by and large pretty much not
notable.  I have all kinds of memories from the rainbow gathering in the
ocala national forest but that is another story entirely.

Also i must mention the folks on the list that e-mailed me with offers of
help and companionship,  Never did get to meet up with any of these folks,
but just that they offered is amazing to me and i am truly grateful.

many more stories i could relate, but this missive has become far too long
already.

peas,

Steve

P.S.  I am on a status on the list where i can submit but am not
subscribed.  Please p-mail me if you want to be sure i see any replies.
