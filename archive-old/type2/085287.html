&lt;&lt; s there a replacement for this that does not involve cloth covered rubber. 
 Do they make steel covered fuel lines?  I'd like to replace it with 
something a bit more rugged since it sits near hot heat exchangers and the 
engine. &gt;&gt;

Pop down to the local &quot;speed shop&quot; and replace everything with braided 
stainless steel and fittings...'Spensive, but you only have to do it once.
Look up &quot;Racer Wholesale&quot;, also for catalog.
