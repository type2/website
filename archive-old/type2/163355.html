Subject: Re: [T2] carb for 1600

The problem with running a 30PICT series carburetor on a dual port engine is
that it will starve at high RPMs (where the vehicle is at freeway/highway
speeds), thus there will be a loss of power, especially for hill climbing,
something that the Type 2 is already deficient in accomplishing under the
best ideal &quot;stock&quot; conditions.

Your long-time VW mechanic is partially right.  The 30PICT is a far better
carb - but for 1500/1600 SINGLE Port Engines.  The 4mm larger throttle bore
size DOES make a difference.

As a side note, the 30PICT series carb was used on Dual Port Engines in
Europe and other countries - BUT - with 1200 or 1300 displacement.

&gt;        The Brazilian Weber on my 1600 dual port managed to foul all
&gt; the plugs within a few mi after the motor rebuild.  I gather that
&gt; when that type of carb is too worn there's nothing practical to do
&gt; with it.
&gt;        I have found a 34 PICT but one longtime VW mechanic tells me
&gt; a 30 PICT from the 1500 is a far better carb.
&gt;        Any opinions welcome!
