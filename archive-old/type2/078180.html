Subject: RE: [T2] Jump start blues!

Just a quick note that your engine will run off of
battery voltage for a while, that is until there isn't
enough juice to get a spark (spark doesn't use all
that much).  So your Gen light will come on if your
Gen is shot or V reg is gone, but your car will run at
least for a while. 
Also, in regard to &quot;popping the clutch&quot; in first going
backward in a 78 Type 2.  First, you should not pop
the clutch with FI Type 2s.  It can damage the FI
system (I think there is a warning on the driver's
side sun shade). Second, if you popped the clutch in
first going backward, you will rotate the engine the
wrong way.  Now I'm not saying it wont run, seeing as
how I have never tried it, but your timing would be
way off.  Instead of 7.5 degrees BTDC it would be 7.5
ATDC (static timed, and way, way more than that 15
degree difference when you reved).  
Finally, if you only have a hot starter problem and
you just need to get the van started, I have popped
the clutch to get going, even though I know that you
shouldn't, but its better all around to pop the clutch
in second and not in first (Factors: Engine inertia,
lower RPM and clutch).  

Rick


PS When jumping a dead battery (don't jump start FI
Type 2s) you should bypass the dead battery.  Do this
by connecting possitive terminal to possitive terminal
but negative (earth for those on the other side of the
Atlantic) from good battery to a solid ground (not
dead battery negative terminal).

&gt; Mike, thanks for your reply.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; RED DOESN'T GO TO NEGATIVE, RED GOES TO
&gt; PLUS!!!!!!! 
&gt; Beat that in your
&gt; &gt; head over and over and over!  And then one more
&gt; time!
&gt; 
&gt; I hear ya man, but unfortunately - in my bus - the
&gt; colors are switched.
&gt; Red is the ground, and the hot wire is black.... 
&gt; Like
&gt; someone else said,
&gt; valuable lesson here, always question the PO's work!
&gt; 
&gt; I didn't....
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Don't hook it up the other way unless you want to
&gt; FRY everything.  If
&gt; &gt; you have any radio's or other devices, those are
&gt; prone to FRY too!!  My
&gt; &gt; friend fried his amp by hooking it up backwards..
&gt; that was a costly
&gt; &gt; mistake.
&gt; 
&gt; Well, I already did it, that's why I posted in the
&gt; first place.  Not
&gt; sure what is fried and what isn't, just that my red
&gt; light is on.
&gt;   
&gt; &gt; I'd first hook your battery up the correct way. 
&gt; Hook up the wiring
&gt; &gt; harness with all the red cables on it (and a big
&gt; fat
&gt; (probably black)
&gt; &gt; one that goes to the starter) to the positive(+)
&gt; terminal and the other
&gt; &gt; braided one that goes to the chassis to negative
&gt; (-).
&gt; 
&gt; Everything was hooked up properly before I posted, I
&gt; was just wondering
&gt; if anyone had any ideas on why the red light was on.
&gt;  
&gt; &gt; put in the new one, and test out the voltage at
&gt; different points in the
&gt; &gt; car.  Fuse box is probably a good place.  You
&gt; should
&gt; have 12v on your
&gt; &gt; meter.  This is with the key off.
&gt; 
&gt; This is helpful, will do.  Thanks!
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Then try and see if the car will start.  If it
&gt; does,
&gt; go and test the
&gt; &gt; voltage again and it should be running at around
&gt; 13.7 volts.  If it is,
&gt; &gt; your voltage regulator is still working correctly.
&gt; 
&gt; If it's higher, then
&gt; &gt; it's not working.  I don't know the reprocussions
&gt; of
&gt; having a bad
&gt; &gt; regulator so be careful..
&gt; 
&gt; The car starts fine, it just runs w/ the red light
&gt; on.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; I don't how else you'd check your regulator, but
&gt; I'm
&gt; sure if I missed
&gt; &gt; something that someone else will chime in.
&gt; 
&gt; One listee replied in pmail w/ a way to repolarize
&gt; the
&gt; generator, which
&gt; I'll try if the voltage doesn't check out.  He
&gt; suggested this:
&gt; 
&gt; &quot;Polarizing the generator is easy. I believe you
&gt; jump
&gt; the D+ to the DF on the
&gt; regulator momentarily only. Check with someone else
&gt; before you do it.&quot;
&gt; 
&gt; Can anyone verify this?
&gt; 
&gt; Peace, Milo
&gt; 
&gt; PS.  Thanks to everyone else for the replies as
&gt; well!
