Subject: blown spark plug cause?
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com, type2_at_type2_dot_com

Driving home today I blew the #4 plug out and #3 was very loose. I had been 
driving 60-65(70 when passing) for about an hour. 1600 dp, no gauges but the 
dip stick was never hot. I read through the archives and it seems that a heli 
coil is the way to fix it(contrary opinins?). But what I'm wondering is what 
causes it. I've never had it happen before and drive this truck much more 
nicely than others in the past. Is it just the curse of crappy heads? a sign 
of over heating?
any input is appreciated.
thanks
ronnie
