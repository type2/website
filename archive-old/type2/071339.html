&gt; I acquired my 1979 1600dp just over a year ago here in the UK. Not knowing 
&gt;  anything about aircooled engines or busses the archives have provided me 
&gt;  with a great deal of information to help ease up the learning curve. 
However 
&gt; 
&gt;  I'd now like to ask the list for some basic help with pushrod tubes. There 
&gt;  is a small oil leak from a couple of the pushrod tubes on one side of the 
&gt;  engine. On checking my manuals and the archives I see I need to remove the 
&gt;  valve gear and a spring retainer to be able to pull out the tubes. 
strangely 
&gt; 
&gt;  there doesn't appear to be a retainer on either cylinder head. Is there 
&gt;  something different about a 79 engine or are they missing? If this is 
normal 
&gt; 
&gt;  how are they kept in place and will they just pull out?
&gt;  Thanks for any help.

Hi Keith,

Its likely that what you are reading is refering to 2 litre Type 4 engines 
rather than 1600 Type 1 engines such as you have. This is due to a minority 
of the world not having T2s with 1600 engines sold there by VW after 1972 so 
much advice on the web for later engines disregards uprights.

If you have a leak from your push rod tubes on a Type 1 engine then the push 
rod tubes cannot be replaced with 'standard' tubes without removing the heads 
from the engine, which itself requires the engine out of the bus (but it can 
be done on a type 4 engine).

So you would need to replace them with the telescopic ones sold by many after 
market dealers - they come in two parts which slide together then when in 
place are lengthened and held against head and crank case by tightening a 
nut. The ones I have seen on sale in the UK are half blue and half gold which 
may help with identification.

To access the push rod tubes you will need to remove the lower tin ware (it 
may be easier to leave the front bolts in place as they are a PIG to put back 
and just bend the tin ware down).
Remove the rocker cover, unbolt the rocker assembly and remove it.
The push rods can now be pulled out and there are no retainers.

IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE WHICH PUSHRODS GO IN WHICH HOLES, DO NOT MIX THEM UP, 
EVEN NOTE WHICH END IS TO THE CRANK. THEY SHOULD GO BACK IN THE SAME HOLES 
WITH THE SAME ORIENTATION.

Now just grab the empty push rod tubes and pull them out - if you have a pair 
of tin snips then just snip them in half for easy removal. Ensure that the 
old oil seals are removed as they may stay in place on the engine.

The telescopic push rod tubes can then be put in place and the nut tightened 
to fit. (dont forget to put the new seals on the ends)

Put the push rods back into the same holes and with the same orientation as 
the holes they were removed from. Refit the rocker assembly. refit the tin 
ware.

Now you will need to adjust the tappet clearance as your work will have upset 
the critical clearances. Refit the rocker cover using a new gasket.

If you are working on both sides do both sides before starting the engine; as 
it needs to be stone cold to do the tappets.

AS SOON AS you have started the engine go around the back and check for oil 
leeks failure to do so may wreck your complete engine; an improperly fitted 
rocker cover gasket will allow the complete sump full of oil to escape in 20 
minutes (or less). But work carefully and check methodically and you should 
be OK.

Good luck

PS - while doing this procedure 2 years back on a friends van we found one of 
the removed push rod tubes actually had a patch welded to it and had been 
turned so that the patch was facing up - no wonder it leaked!
