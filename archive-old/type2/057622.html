Subject: What are these bearings telling me?

Hi all:

I split the case of my junk yard Vanagon 2.0L engine.  Looking at the 
back of the #2 main bearing insert I'm reading the following:

           85072610
           U1/0.25

This engine was rebuilt by VW Canada and the engine number has an 
asterisk (*) behind it, so I'm assuming the case was align bored and the 
crank was turned?  So is the &quot;U1/0.25&quot; related to the undersize of the 
crank and the oversize of the case?

TIA.
