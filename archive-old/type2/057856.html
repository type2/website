Subject: Re: Horn?

David..
	You *could* make three right turns instead of one left :)
	no, really. I believe the horn always has power to it on one terminal,
and that the other terminal's wire travels straight up through the
steering column to the horn button. When you press the button, that
completes the circuit, providing a ground for the power to flow to, and
thus beeping the horn.
	After years and years of that wire brushing against the steering
column, it can get worn through, which will on occasion ground out the
horn wire and allow the horn to beep without you pressing the horn
button. This is especially interesting, when the police are in the
immediate vicinity.
	The fix is, in your case (I think), to run a new wire up through the
steering column. One trick that is often used is to attach the new wire
to the old one and pull the old one out, thus pulling the new one in.
	Sine this is a common occurrence with old VW buses, it has been
discussed ad nauseum in the Archives. If you'll go over to
http://www.i405_dot_com/vwarchive/  and see that page, you'll notice that
there are &quot;Message&quot; and &quot;Body&quot; headings... I entered into the &quot;Body&quot;
heading the following words: horn wire column... exactly like that, and
upon the &quot;submit query&quot; button being pressed, the search engine sent
back many references to horn problems that, if browsed, will probably
solve your problem.

Good luck, and remember the Archives...

&gt; Can't find this in the archives.  When I turn a hard left, not a slight left,
&gt; the horn honks in my '70 bus.  Not so on turns to the right.  The horn
&gt; operates normally otherwise.  Any ideas?
