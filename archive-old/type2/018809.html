Well, I finally got my misspellings right for the archive search.  I
tried Vacuum instead of Vacume and guage instead of gauge, and I found
what I was after.  From now on I'll be more patient and not call to the
list the first time I can't find something.  Anyway, for those who don't
know,  I recently put brand new heads (AMC unfortunately), rings
(Chrome, not cast unfortunately), 009 dizzy (unfortunately) which will
be replaced soon, and rebuilt Dellorto's in my 72 campmobile.  Also
replaced any bearings and gaskets I could reach without getting into the
bottom end.  I've had a problem where I think it is faking a vacuum leak
so I bought a vacuum gauge and went at it.  I also pulled my old Clymer
Bug Book out of the basement and found a whole page devoted to vacuum
readings.  Also did a compression test on the engine.  I've got about 20
miles on this rebuild so far and here are my results.
I've listed results by cylinder order 1, 2, 3, 4.
Vacuum gauge is connected to the sensing port which is just below the
throttle valve.
Compression: 100, 95, 96, 95.
Vacuum at idle the needle flaps around wildly between: (9-14), (5-16),
(8-14), (8-14).
Vacuum at about 2000 rpm is much more steady: (9-11), (12-14), (10-12),
(10,12).

According to Clymer, I've got a head gasket leak on the 1,2 cylinder
head.  Since there is no head gasket I'm thinking it might be a bad seal
between the cylinders and the head?  If so, how do I correct this
problem?  I'm also thinking that the Clymer vacuum page is all about one
carb feeding four cylinders and not one carb feeding one cylinder like I
have.  So maybe the vacuum diagnosis page doesn't apply to me?  Are
these low compression readings normal for new rings?  Any thoughts,
guesses, or advice would be greatly appreciated.

Tomorrow I will try to balance the carbs using the vacuum gauge (
instead of the Unisyn) as it seems this would be the most accurate way.
I also replaced the points today which made the beast run much better,
but I'm still concerned about the vacuum and compression readings.
Thanks for the space.
