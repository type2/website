&lt;&lt; I've just replaced the foam in my Westy. It's flame retardent, but the 
material I've covered it with is not!

Anyone know of a spray on flame retarding product?


Dave, UK &gt;&gt;

Pop down to the local chemist's and ask for boric acid. A mild solution
allowed to dry on the fabric (not vinyl) yields a flame retardant (not
proof !) coating...also repels ants ;-)
