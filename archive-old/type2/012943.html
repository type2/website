Kevin:

Yes, a glasspak can go bad without rusting out.  What happens is all the fibreglass hair inside gets burned, so you don't get any more sound dampening.

&gt;Next question, I replaced my extractor the other day but kept my
&gt;muffler (glasspak).  The extractor had severl rust holes but the
&gt;muffler looked fine.  It's still louder then when I first got my Bus
&gt;so can a muffler(glasspak) wear out before it rusts out?
&gt;
&gt;Thanks,
