this *may* mean that there is a leak
&gt; within the master cylinder between the circuits and that one circuit is
&gt; failing but the leak is feeding fluid that keeps you from noticing.  If it
&gt; flashes, stop and fix it.

&gt; OK...what happens if the light comes on when you start your bus, sometimes, sometimes 
not.  Sometimes it comes on when you are driving, sometimes not.  Sometimes it comes on 
when you step on the brake, sometimes not.  Sometimes it comes on when it rains, 
sometimes not.  Get the picture?  I personally think it's haunted ;-) (Halloween 
reference for free)
