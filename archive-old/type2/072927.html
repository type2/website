Since i don't have a woman these days, I don't have a winch to carry in my
bus.  : )  The last one I dated did not have enough strength to pull me out
of the mud anyway.  She was.....well....shall we say slim and shapely, but
she was agile.

I know its not Friday but I simply couldn't resist.

A &quot;Come  along&quot; would be the best because it would not be so weighty.
Besides you wouldn't have to alter the bumper in anyway.  Go with the &quot;Come
along&quot;.  That way your &quot;winch&quot; could be impressed as you used your muscled
arm ratcheting that lever.

Yes folks I am still alive.
