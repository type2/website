&gt; He said something about the shape of the slots makes it nearly impossible to
&gt; kick back, since they are angled, and will just slip past the bar.
&gt; I'm kinda looking for one myself...
&gt; 
NO! NO!  The angles in the ears on the nuts are the wrong direction to
avoid kickback injury (they have to be, think about it).  They kick the
crank out after the engine starts (you REALLY don't want this to hang in
there, spinning even at idle speed, do you?).

Just because it doesn't happen often, take precautions every time!  How often
does your jack fail?  You don't get under your car with just a jack, though,
do you?

One dislocated thumb is WAY too many.

...but the cranks are way cool, I guess even if they are retrofits.  Much
more than a 36hp isn't much fun to crank, though.
