&gt;I'd like to pretty much buy everything. The ENTIRE wiring harness inside the Bus (which includes everything from the stereo wiring, to the overhead dome light wiring, to the door jambs, the headlights, turn signals, tail-lights, you name it.

I don't believe anybody sells that.

&gt;I also need the entire engine wiring harness. I can't seem to figure out what goes where. I need the harness that goes from the battery to the starter, from the starter to the ignition / alternator, etc. I don't even know if what I have is set up the way it was supposed to.

I don't think anyone sells that for a 72-79 bus.

I believe almost all of the wiring harnesses come indirectly from Wiring Works in San Pedro, CA who support the &quot;vintage&quot; restoration market. West Coast Metric also sells their own harnesses.
