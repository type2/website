Subject: Re: [T2] Excellent tune up

Hi Alan,

There are lots of other variables besides dwell that affect performance 
and fuel economy. Setting the valves properly and ensuring all the 
vacuum hoses are routed correctly could also contribute. Points and 
rotor condition or a bad set of wires could bring on these problems.

If these components have not been properly cared for then it will be 
very difficult to determine where the problems are coming from. When 
you're not sure, replace a single item at a time until you find the 
culprit. And don't skimp on the ones you *know* are OK, do them too. 
After a &quot;Tune-Up&quot; it would be virtually impossible to determine which 
component was at fault: points, cap, rotor, wires, vacuum, valves, 
dwell &amp; timing gives you only a 1 in 8 chance of guessing it right. The 
magic is in the procedure, not the parts.

Just enjoy it, and take it back to the same guy next time.

Happy trails,
