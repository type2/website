Subject: excessive quoting reminder

Hi folks -- This is a great list with a LOT of useful
information, and I am grateful for it.  However, it
could be a bit more efficient.  A couple reminders:

1) PLEASE reduce quoted text to the absolute minimum necessary
to get across the meaning of your comments.  I would guess
that half of the mail I read consists of unnecessary quoted
text.  Please have mercy.

2) The Usenet standard for signatures is 4 lines.
The reason is just the same -- maximize information in
your messages, please!

        Gary
