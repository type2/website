Subject: Re: [T2] Aftermarket Oil thermostat/oil coolers - Long

Hi Heather,

I don't know about your main concerns, but I can see in this paragraph
you are barking up the wrong tree. High RPM lowers head temps but
raises oil temps. Low RPM raises head temps and lowers oil temps.

  Friday I decided to remove the coolers from the system which left the
 engine and the external oil filter. I drove to the Champoeg WW meet Saturday
 - and watched the oil temps stay around 200-220 driving 55-60 mph!!! I
 hardly every go that slow, but if the temps reached 220 I would downshift
 (to raise the rpms for the stock fan to help with the cooling) and pull over
 and waited until the temps went back down. This is much hotter than I have
 ever run, even in California going 80 over the grapevine (with external oil
 coolers) - which would usually stay at 200.
