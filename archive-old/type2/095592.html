Subject: Bus Depot Awning Instructions

For anyone who might have bought one of our new $69 awnings, and couldn't
figure out how to assemble it, we now have an instruction sheet for them. (I
suspect that most people figured it out on their own anyway, as I did myself
when I brought one with me on my last camping trip; there was only one way
of asembling the poles that made sense.)

We will include a copy with all awnings we ship starting tomorrow.  I have
also put one up at
http://home.ceinetworks_dot_com/~ron/awninginstructions.pdf
that you can print out. This is in Adobe Acobat pdf format.  It will be
there for about two weeks, so download it relatively soon if you already
received an awning without instructions.

Thanks,
