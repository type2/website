Subject: Re: Radio ?

We put in a multi cd player, radio and cassette combo earlier this
summer.  I am now finding that even being in a large metro area
(outskirts of Los Angeles) that I am now starting to *prefer* the sounds
of my bus.  This is enhanced by the fact that on radio, like television,
there is so much DREK floating on the airwaves.

My engine is more interesting and sometimes ALOT easier on the ears.

&gt;       I have a question for the list. I own a 72 westy w/ a 1600 dp.  I love
&gt; my bus.  I want to put in  a radio, but im afraid.  I always listen to the
&gt; engine, and i just cant seem to get my self to put in a radio.
