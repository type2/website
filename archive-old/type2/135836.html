Subject: Re: [T2] Westy Replacement foam

Hi Greg,

I'd just like to point out to the westy and westfakia owners out there 
the importance of using the SAME foam for all the parts of the bed in a 
westy. If the foam is softer in one area than it is elsewhere then it 
will be more compressible and as a result you will not be sleeping on 
an even surface. The result of that will be a poor night's sleep, a 
sore back and a spouse who won't want to come camping with you.

Don't go cheap on your mattress. Do it right, be kind to your spine!

Happy New Year,

Greg Potts

&gt; Hey folks, I just received my 79 Westy replacement
&gt; foam from www dot foamorders dot com.  This stuff is
&gt; great!  You can order it any thickness you want.  Most
&gt; sources I had found were only in 1&quot; increments.  This
&gt; outfit will make it any thickness you want.  I ordered
&gt; enough replacement foam for the entire camper sleeping
&gt; area (3 different thicknesses.)  Greg
