Hi Scott;

The previous owner of our '70 Campmobile towed a regular travel trailer [NOT
a tent trailer] to Alaska and back.  That definitely put a big strain on the
drive train and I had some repairs to make after a few thousand miles of
driving the camper.

But the point is that he and his son made the round trip from Bend Oregon to
Fairbanks and back in one piece.  And this was with a dead stock 1600SP
engine.  That's a far more severe situation than you're considering with a
lightweight cargo or tent trailer.

FWIW.....

&gt;&gt;  O.K., here is where I am at. I can rent a small pop top camper from the
Air
Force, and I have a super strong hitch on the Bus as it is, but I still do
not like the idea of pulling a trailer up and down the Pacific Coast with a
71 Bus.  &lt;&lt;
