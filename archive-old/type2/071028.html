Not to worry Hollie
A huge selection will be the least of your problems. With the sizing on your 
westy you'll only have a couple of choices in an LT tire. Yokohama makes two, 
a 356 and a 370. 356 more of a hwy and 370 little more aggresive tread 
pattern. Available in both 185 (stock) and 195/70 14 sizes 185 more 
expensive. Others have found Michelens in correct sizes. Havent had much 
experience w/Mich, have had good luck on Yoko's on a variety of vehicles. 
Currently run 195/70x14 on the 70 westy 59.00 +ftl
