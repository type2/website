&gt; 	Well observed George, the hose WAS stressed. The new piece
&gt; is a bigger loop but looking at it I suspect a short, straight,
&gt; piece is what the factory imagined for this location. The parts
&gt; book doesn't even show a piece of flexable hose between the
&gt; feed line (113-127-521A or G, part 48, Group 1, illustration 12, 
&gt; page 1-50) and the fuel pump inlet (O21-127-025, part 1, same).
&gt; 
&gt; 	The book gives hose size as 5 X 2.5mm. I make that 3/16 ID, 
&gt; 3/32 wall thickness, if I can't find metric, right? Of course
&gt; I'll look for the right stuff first. The steel fuel pipe is given
&gt; as 6mm, which I presume is OD...

I think that the sizes are correct, but I've never had any luck at
finding SAE-sized replacements for the metric-size fuel lines. 
Everything I've tried is either loose or too tight.  Luckily, you can
easily get the correct metric line through friendly mailorder suppliers
if you can't get it locally.  Even some local US FLAPS are carrying a
better selection as even US cars are going metric.

The one exception to this is the big vacuum line that goes to the brake
booster on '71 and up buses.  There is an SAE-sized hose that is within
.002 inches of the correct ID, which is close enough if you have priced
the metric hose in this size!

You should replace the looped hose with a straight one.  Hoses don't
take kindly to being bent too tightly.  I think that the rule of thumb
is that the hose should not be bent in a radius tighter than 5 times
its outside diameter.
