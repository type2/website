Subject: redline/weber?

I deleted the email from the guy who was running redline weber FI in his 
bus.

Would you please pmail me as I am very interested in hearing how it works 
and how much it ended up costing.

Seems that on their web site, they don't want to quote prices....hmmmmust 
mean I can't afford it!

Thanks, dave
