Subject: LPG (Propane) conversion ..

As a dodgy European I have to be carefull with my language !...

I have a Petrol (Gas) powered 1600cc Type II and I want to convert it to LPG
(Gas).

I may be in trouble .. Has anyone considered this (or even done it?)     The
&quot;Problem&quot; is that you need hot water to work the vapouriser ...

I've heard of people wrapping a bit of pipe round the Exhaust (Muffler) and
then building an expansion bottle outfit .. But I've never seen such a
conversion and I worry what would happen if you were running on petrol would
it all boil up ?

The other thought I had was why not &quot;Create&quot; a hot water cooling system ..
with a Diesel preheater and a cooling system .. this would have the
advantage that we could put radiators with Chintz covers in the bus ..

Anyone had any experience her ?

Justin
