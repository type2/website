Just got a copy of the December '96 VW Trends magazine.  In it is an 
article describing the different levels of enhancement that Mark 
Stephens does on the Type IV engines.  Anybody out there that has had 
a Mark Stephens engine had one of the enhanced versions, if so, which 
one, and what is your experience and costs?  If I ever need another 
engine done, I would consider a higher output engine, but at what 
cost; $, longevity, additional emissions, etc.

&gt; I recently put a Mark Stephens rebuilt engine in my '80 Vanagon Westy.  So
&gt; far it seems to be working well.  I did question this list about a problem
