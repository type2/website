Subject: [T2] electrical problem- please help!!

I have been trying to fix this problem since I bought my bus over 5
years ago.  I am hoping someone out there can give me some
troubleshooting tips.  I have a 76 Westy with a refrigerator powered by
the auxiliary battery and (or) a power converter.  I am pretty sure it
has a battery isolator set up of some kind because the auxiliary battery
will drain and leave the main battery charged.  The refrigerator works
fine and cools nicely on both battery power and &quot;city power&quot;.  The
alternator charges the auxiliary battery when the engine is running.
The problem starts when I try to charge the auxiliary battery  using the
power converter.  As soon as I turn the charge timer on the fuse inside
the power converter door starts to get really hot and eventually blows.
I had to have my power converter fixed because it fried the last time I
attempted to work on this.  Well it is working OK now but there is
obviously something very wrong somewhere.  I am wondering if it is not
hooked up to the auxiliary battery correctly or maybe I have a wire
shorting somewhere.  I know enough about electricity to operate
(somewhat!) a voltmeter but that is about it. I am thinking maybe the
timer switch is bad?  Is there any way I can test it?  Any specific
things I should check?  Thanks in advance.
