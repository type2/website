      Hi. Back again with a couple questions.
I did a tune up yesterday, points rotor,condenser,plugs, wires and valve
adjustments.
(Man are those valve cover bails tight compared to an upright!)
      Upon starting I noticed that the left carb (stock solex) would
backfire when I tried to give it gas. Is this a vacuum leak?
      The PO pulled out the air pump and there are two lines sealed off
now.These go into some sort of vacuum manifold and to the carbs,is this
alright like this?
      I was thinking I should pull the left  carb and rebuild it.

       Another prob is the distributor cap wobbles when the engine is
running!
The body of the distributor is still but do I have a very worn or even bent
shaft?

       Hope I can get some help.
      Thanks in advance.
