Subject: FS 1981 Vanagon Westy
To: type2_at_type2_dot_com

1981 Vanagon Westfalia for sale:
120K miles, 2L aircooled fuel injection engine, 4 spd manual trans, 
mechanically very good, body good (color light blue with white pop-top), 
interior fair, non-deluxe camper package includes pop-top, icebox and sink. 
Clear title and registration. $3,500 or best offer.  The van is located in 
Alameda, CA.
I have all service records for the past 90K miles (since 1986). Here's a list 
of major items serviced in the last 20K miles, since I have owned it: 
Clutch repair (including new throw-out bearing &amp; slave cylinder), New engine 
seals (It doesn't drip any oil), Front &amp; rear brake pads, Master cylinder 
(new) &amp; power brake booster (used), wheel cylinders (new), CV joints and 
boots (new), Rear wheel bearings (new), KYB shocks (new), Michelin MX front 
tires (new), installed VDO oil temp gauge and holder, Oil changed regularly 
at 3K mile intervals, engine recently tuned with new plugs, air filter, dist 
cap and rotor.

Included in the price of camper is a large supply of spare parts,
some brand new and some used. Parts include: a rebuildable engine
(engine fully disassembled, parts cleaned, boxed and labeled), Complete 
exhaust system (CA model) with brand new muffler, Complete fuel injection 
system, Engine sheet metal painstakingly beadblasted and repainted (looks 
brand new).
There are enough parts to fill the cargo area of the van, which is
the reason why I'm selling the it. I'm moving from Cupertino, CA into a
smaller home in Alameda that doesn't have a garage, and I don't feel like
paying for a storage of the parts, nor would I own a VW without an
abundance of spare parts and a place to work on it. The ideal buyer is 
someone mechanically inclined who will make use of the parts, which are quite 
expensive and becoming scarce. The parts will keep the van running for a long 
time with minimal cost. If interested, please contact me by e-mail.
