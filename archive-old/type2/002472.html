&gt;Regarding the recent comments about Bondo: Bondo is a brand name that has
become the generic term for body fillers, like Kleenex has for tissues.
IMHO, Bondo is crap. However, there are several fillers that are excellent.

I've always used stuff made by Evercote, called, I think, Featherlite, a two
part filler which I buy at auto paint stores.  It is not expensive, at least
compared to the cost of paint, but then, I do sand about 90% of it away.  It
will last for years in the can, and has given good results.

I call all that stuff bondo, just like I call copiers xerox machines.  Let
'em sue me.

Regards,

Grant
