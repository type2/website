Subject: '77 California exhaust system needed

I recently purchased a 1977 Bus with an exhaust system
that will not pass California smog.  I knew this
before I bought the van.  There are two straight pipes
going into the mufflers, no catalytic converters.  

I need a complete exhaust system for a 1977 bus.  I'm
not concerned about looks or quality.  Used is fine. 
I just need it to pass smog.  Anyone want to sell one?

I'm thinking of going to pickapart this weekend,
something I've never done before, but probably should.
 Problem as always is time.  I would rather go camping
on the weekends than hang out at pickapart, but either
idea is kind of fun.

Any other good salvage yards in the SF Bay area?

I looked at the bus depot catalogs and they don't
carry complete california-spec exhausts for 77 buses. 
What to do?  

BTW, when will this '77 be waived of smog requirements
in California?
