&gt; &quot;I have been working on VW's since 1969. I have tried several times to

&gt; take the whole vehicle to an experienced VW repair man. He will put
&gt; the pipe on with a new gasket, and braze the pipe to the broken off
&gt; studs with a gas torch and brass rod. It sounds barbaric and it is,
&gt; but it works like a charm and lasts the life of the engine.&quot;

I wouldnt do this at all.... but YMMV...

ANY competent machinist or mechanic can remove the stud with a mig welder
and a nut, or ath teh very least drill it out and put in a step-stud or
the same size depending on how well he drills.

I cannot think of any way that one can torque the heaterboxes in place so
as to compress teh copper washer and seal the heaterbox to the head.

Sounds liek a recipie for leaks with no way to fix em.

take care,

Steve
