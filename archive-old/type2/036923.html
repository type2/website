Subject: Type 4 Engine stand

Hello everyone. I know this was a subject a while ago but I still havn't
found out how to set up a stand that is strong enough to hold the heavier
type 4 engine. Does anyone sell one? I was also thinking of getting an old
transmission housing with a starter to use as a test stand so I could run
the engine before installing it in a bus. Has anyone done this?

 Thanks,
