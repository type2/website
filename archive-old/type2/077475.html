Subject: Sunroof solutions for former poptop campers??

Hi Bryan,
No one seems to be answering your questions so even
though I can't refer you to any particular companies I
can tell you that there are a couple of firms that
make ragtop style sunroofs for buses that formerly had
poptops.
The only one I have info on is in England but surely
there must be a firm in the US that does the same
thing or is willing to try it.
The firm in England custom fits the roof to the size
of the existing hole...result:no welding or other
hassles.
Surely someone here knows of a company that does this
in the US.
:-)
Cheers

&gt; This is crazy, but...  Anybody out there know of any
&gt; conversions or good
&gt; how-to's for the roof of the campers?  Here's the
&gt; deal:  I have found what
&gt; seems to be a very good deal on a '70, pretty good
&gt; shape, needs a few of the
&gt; panels worked on, but runs great.  -Will need a
&gt; clutch soon, but that is no
&gt; big thing either.  I have always wanted a bus, just
&gt; not a camper.  The roof
&gt; just does not fit into the style bus I see myself
&gt; with in the end.
&gt; -However it is not likely that I'll find an equally
&gt; good deal on any other
&gt; VW.  $400 in this case.  So, I'd like to make it a
&gt; rag top, or just fill it
&gt; in.  I'm sure I could fabricate something to &quot;patch
&gt; the roof&quot; and welding is
&gt; okay for me.  But if there is a known solution, I'd
&gt; certainly like to get
&gt; the info before my purchase on Friday.  Any help or
&gt; comments are greatly
&gt; appreciated.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks,
