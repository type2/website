Subject: Re: [T2]  Dizzy Help Update

I just stopped over at my VW/bmw repair shop nearby and  picked one up. 
I don't know if your local FLAPS would have that part or not, but it
couldn't hurt to try.  One thing to remember;  It's a b*tch to get that
dizzy in with the  new o-ring.  It'll take some elbow grease to get it
to fit back into the hole.  I would grease it up well...

&gt; Ok all,
&gt;   I removed the dizzy and found that the shaft had two small o rings. I
&gt; looked in Bentley and found that there should be a &quot;single O ring&quot;. So now I
&gt; know why its leaking oil and that I will never take the bus back to the shop
&gt; who fixed it. Now I was wondering where I can pick up one of these O rings?
&gt; Any info will not be turned away.
&gt; 
&gt; TIA

&gt; Volks,
&gt;   Here is what I have '79 2.0L FI with CALIF Emissions.
&gt; 
&gt;   I have a two part question: First does the Dizzy have a gasket/seal to the
&gt; case? (I think I am leaking oil around the shaft of the dizzy).
&gt; 
&gt; Second:
&gt;   If a seal/gasket does happen to be there, what is the sure fire way to
&gt; remove a dizzy. I have never pulled a dizzy so please make the procedure a
&gt; simple as possible.  I read the bently manuall and I think I can do it. Any
&gt; information will be greatly appreciated.
&gt; 
&gt; TIA
