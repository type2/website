&gt; I have them. I have made up a bit of a page for them at

&gt; any idea how to get in touch with them?

Hey there Volks,

I just got emailed an &quot;ok&quot; from the author (Ron Maxon) of the article
on &quot;Jalousies in a Vanagon&quot; so anyone wanting to take look at the
article should go here:

http://www.everybus_dot_com/dworkin/vgon_jalousie/

Mr. Maxon also said in the email &quot;Glad to see people interested in
the window conversion, hopefully next time we buy a vanagon they will
already be installed&quot;

Steve, thanks for hosting the scans.

Enjoy,
