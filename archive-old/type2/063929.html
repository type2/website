Subject: Ras Bulli Split Rides Again!!

Air-cooled volks:

        Ras Bulli Split is once again on the road!  Passed MOT inspection 
[or MVI as they appear to call it here in New Brunswick]...Wohoo!  I actually
drove the bus to the work this morning [70 miles] and averaged 60mph the whole
way...he even pulled up the Petersville Hill in fourth and was still doing over 
50 at the summit [this is a first for the '66].  

Compression is good -- 128, 124, 118, 125 -- on the 1660dp [#3 is a little low
but I'm not that concerned...yet].  However, I noticed a slight oil leak after
arriving in the parking garage at work...just a few ounces and it stopped after
about 5 minutes.  This is a new leak...I am hoping that it is something simple
like the sump-plate or valve cover...seeing as it just had the valves set and 
subsequent oil change.  Despite all this, I checked the oil -- dipstick was 
warm, but not hot -- and it was down less than a pint.  Oil pressure stayed
right around 30 the whole trip [Gunter re-filled with 20/50 after doing the 
valves and timing...I usually run straight 30w in the summer..so I assume this
contributed to the lower pressure].

A little more disheartening is the generator/regulator does not appear to be 
charging [the battery was low this morning after driving around with the lights
on last night].  My ammeter is still wired backwards [thanks to the PO] so it
shows a negative drain when charging and goes positive while starting...I will
fix this on the weekend.  However while running this morning, the guage was 
right in the middle...no charging?   Would the reversely wired ammeter affect
the behaviour of the regulator?  It seems unlikely to I as it is down stream
and should provide the same amount of resistence in either direction.
The other element in this equation is that the bus currently has a deep-cycle
battery...could this be too much for the generator/regulator.  Additionally, 
the gen. warning light never came on...of course, I will have to check to ensure
that it actually works ;)  

I have a trip to MTL coming up in two weeks and would like to have the 
generator at least holding its own with the lights on.  I'll put the 
multi-meter on it tonight to get some more data...in the worse case, I can
&quot;borrow&quot; the regualtor/generator from the Thing...:(

Bugs &amp; Things &amp; Splits...Oh, my!

Roy

BTW:  Welcome back to all those returning from Inuvik [even you too Bob ;)...
        I give you a week to get caught up with the family then I may start
        with my list of questions with respect to my &quot;ground-up&quot; 1600dp
        project [with full-flow oil, hydraulic followers, CDI, etc.] ;-)]
