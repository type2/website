&gt; Before you totaly dismiss the stock VW bus tranaxle, I would go to this

&gt; lot of other Buses powered by V8's and V6's that use the stock VW trans,
&gt; both the 002's and the 091's. This is an Aussie site and I think it belongs
&gt; to a list member. He may be able to answer a lot of questions for you.

Yes, the bus transaxle can be built up to handle more power, but even then
it is a 4-speed with limited ratios.  If I'm changing the engine anyway,
it would seem prudent to use the transmission that goes with the engine.
Some Corvair conversions in the past used this approach.

the sticky point remains the ring gear.  I wish I could find someone who
has been inside one and who knows if the ring gear can be flopped.

Or... Hmmm... How about adapting reduction box swing axles to the Subaru
tranny :)
