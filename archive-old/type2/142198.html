Subject: Re: [T2] Timing marks on 69

----- Original Message ----- 
From: Brian Eney
&gt; I have been trying to set my timing on my 69, the books show three marks.
Two
&gt; marks close together one further apart....Is the possible the pulley is
marked wrong.

You have the correct pulley for your year, assuming you have the original
engine (B series).  The single left notch is TDC and the next two are 7.5
and 10 BTDC, respectively.  If you also have the original distributor, then
it should be timed to TDC with the vacuum hose off.  If you have a doubt,
then you will need to get the part number for the distributor (stamped on
the outside) so that it can be identified, and the correct timing
specification given.
