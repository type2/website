&gt; I have a '74 bus with the 1800 dual carb engine.  It has been running great

&gt; and won't restart easily after stalling, sometimes requires a cool down
&gt; period before it will start.  This also seems to be getting progressively
&gt; worse.  I have a bit of repair/maintenance experience from owning a '69 1600
&gt; bus for several years, but haven't done much work on the '74 yet. A search
&gt; of the type2 database showed several folks with idle problems while cool,
&gt; but not much about after-warmup problems.  Any help will be appreciated.

it could be a vacuum leak. if you have a vacuum gauge hook it up and
see what idle vacuum is.
