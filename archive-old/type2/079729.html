&gt; My engine is a 1700, no smog, carbs. I know the engines are pretty much the

the 79 has a one year only exhaust system (ask me how i know) the
basic engine is just like the 78 except the 79 came from the factory
with square &quot;vanagon&quot; exhaust ports. at least the 79 (IIRC earlier
pancake engines) came w/ a cali setup and a federal setup. My federal
setup doesn't have any smog pump. But it does has the hook ups or the
EGR valves, but the PO took them off :(
 
&gt; Assuming I get a rebuilt from AVP, can I just order an 1800 engine, even
&gt; though it has the holes in the head and is made for a smog pump? Do we just
&gt; plug the holes? Would it be smarter to just get the exact same 1700 engine?
 
While it's my first bus I have been very happy w/ the 2 liter. Hyd
lifters are veeeeeery nice.

&gt; I was also looking at the 2000cc long block with hydraulic lifters. Seems
&gt; like a lot of people (including Boston Bob) think thats the way to go. What
&gt; besides the exhaust would I have to get/change?

I suspect you might have some issues w/ the fuel delivery system. Can
you get FI? for this engine?

&gt; Whats the difference between a 78 and 79 engine?

I think just the heads. (square vs round)
