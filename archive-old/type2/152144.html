&gt; Hi Richard
&gt; We're down in Hobart..  Have a really good mechanic here who manages
&gt; to source most things that we have needed.  He is a flat four lover
&gt; with a great '69 Dual-cab (plus a brand new series 5 GTI Golf-!!) so
&gt;
&gt; Have followed discussions on list re tyres &amp; checked archives but
&gt; still can't make up my mind re what tyres to use.  Currently have
&gt; Bridgestone 185/75 passenger tyres fitted.  Any recommendations?

check out the Michelin Agelis tires
