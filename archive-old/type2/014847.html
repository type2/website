Subject: chugging and snorting
To: type2_at_type2_dot_com

Hi all,

This may sound dumb, but I need some input and assistance.  I have 72 bus, 
and have recently replace the fuel lines, and all of the hoses on the engine. 
 (The engine was pulled to do the work.)  This was done by a mechanic, not 
me.  He said that the engine was fine, compression, carburetor and 
transmission were all good.  

My problem is this; after going on the freeway for the first time in months, 
the bus ran fine, until I got off to turn around and go home.  I had driven 
about 20 miles at an average of 56 - 58 MPH.  The weather was hot, around 96 
degrees in Southern California.  When I got back on the freeway, it chugged 
and felt like I could put the gas pedal on the floor without any fuel going 
through to the engine.  It took some time, but got back up to speed and then 
ran fine until I left the freeway again to go home.  Then it chugged and lack 
of energy started up again.

I had gone through only one tank of 89 octane unleaded (I had previously only 
used 92 octane) and then filled up with 92 Octane unleaded for this drive.

Could this be due to the hot day, the engine being pulled, the new fuel lines 
or ????

BTW, thanks for all of the help with my road swaying problems.  New ball 
joint boots, tie rod boots, adjusted steering box and drag link were just 
completed.  Also new tires (8 ply tires recommended by Discount Tire Center 
to prevent drifting) and alignment.  It ran great!

Thanks for all of the help, I am still new at all of this and am in the 
process of restoration.
