Subject: Re: '71 bus Carrier Bolts

&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Whilst installing the engine in my '71 bus the small bolt from the rear 
&gt;carrier stripped and destroyed the threaded insert in the block. I asked 
&gt;the local VW guy who said 'no problem, it's only for alignment anyway, 
&gt;the two big bolts carry the weight.' For evidence, he said that  a lot of 
&gt;buses run with those oil pump cover adaptors which bolt to the carrier, 
&gt;and that's a lot flimsier than the two big bolts in mine.
&gt;
&gt;Any opinions? I'd love to not have to drag my engine to a shop to get a 
&gt;new insert put in, but if it really matters I'll do it.

For what it's worth -- the center bolt bushing has been pulled out
of my rear carrier for as long as I've had the bus -- 7 years/90 000 mi.
I have had the big bolts break on me, which is a pita....the crank
pulley falls into the top of the rear carrier, burning up the fan belt
and immobilizing the bus.

I think you're safe running it with the big bolts, but the next time
you have then engine out, I'd at least think about getting a sleeve put
in.
