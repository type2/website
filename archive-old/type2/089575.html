Subject: Re: [T2]Westy models

Even the current &quot;winnebago/westfalia&quot;  has variations with a basic add 
on package that i cant find the name for, and a weekender package, and 
the full camper package.  the vanagon series had variations also with 
weekender and full camper models.  At the motorworks  campout this 
weekend i saw the same theme in 70's buses.  FANTASTIC weekend.

&gt; mine is called a &quot;campmobile&quot;, little sticker on the side of the sink, i
&gt; think. but i have heard of one called a &quot;day camper&quot;. would this be what
&gt; the hard top westy would be called? or was it a later year thing? 
&gt; perhaps
&gt; it was a vanagon thing? i know i have heard of them, but now i am 
&gt; curious
&gt; just exactly what they are.

&gt; ... For camper aficionados: is there sensible reason why the interior is
&gt;&gt;&gt; Westfalia camperized but there is no poptop?
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; It is a non-poptop Westy. Westfalia made 3 models:
&gt;&gt; P-21 has no poptop. Has sink, cooler, bed in back, main table in
&gt;&gt; rear, childs cot in front.
&gt;&gt; P-22 has poptop. All of above, and bed in top.
&gt;&gt; P-27 is the deluxe Westy. All of the above plus 2 burner stove,
&gt;&gt; fridge instead of cooler, front table, storage container/stool between
&gt; front seats.
