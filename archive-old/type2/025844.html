&gt; good idea to repaint, are you able to do that yourself or do you have
&gt; to take it somewhere. Where can i take it if I wanted someone else to
&gt; do it?

Most any autobody shop or boat repair shop can paint fiberglass. Find one
that works on a lot of Corvettes if you want a great job and you're really
into spending money.

Or you can paint it yourself if you know how to paint cars; tell the guy at
the paint counter you're painting fiberglass and you'll get the proper
primer.
