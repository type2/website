Subject: 34PDSIT Carburetor idling parts and adjustment question

My 73 BUS with dual 34 pdsit -2 carburetors often idles rough and stalls. It 
seemed that I may have it adjusted too low. The Dist (.009), spark plugs, and 
wires are new. Timing and dwell are set to specifications. 

Looking at the Bentley manual (2-10) a manifold connects the two carburetors. 
Currently mine does not have this installed. When I dug through a box of 
removed broken smog parts I found a manifold with five outlets. The manifold 
is X shaped and it is clear that the two (left )? outlets would match up in 
size and position with the left carburetor. The right outlet would match the 
corresponding outlet on the right carburetor. Another outlet of similar size 
head towards the rear of the engine and bend upward in a dog leg fashion. I 
believe it connected to a device above where the air pump was attached. The 
fifth outlet is small (4-5mm) such as commonly found on vacuum lines. 

What I am thinking is to reconnect this manifold and block off the large and 
small outlets that have no observable corresponding connection. 

But, why bother if this is not necessary at all.

Does anyone have any knowledge of what all this situation and the cure?

Thank-you
