Subject: '77 Transporter F/S

Hi all,

I have a '77 Transporter that I have as a project.  I picked it up for $1000
seven or eight months ago I think.  The seat was dropped on number three
when I bought it and I started to work on it when I had the time, and have
run out of time, as I am now being badgered to paint the house.  Alas, the
'77 is in the way, and I need it gone.  The engine is apart, and all the
work still needs to be done, so I am anticipating a loss on my investment.

I have listed it in the local paper for $750 OBO expecting to get at least
$500 - which is the least I am willing to let it go for.

Since I have been helped before by the list groups and there is such a great
sense of community.  And while I have seen people who are members of the
same church unwilling to help each other, whereas on this list I have seen
people go out of thier way to help complete strangers, I am willing to skip
all the polotics make the '77 available to anyone on the WetWesties or Type2
lists for that same $500.

I am in Western Washington, almost on the Canadian border.  Help I just need
to get it out of here.
