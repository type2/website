&lt;&lt; On the 1600 DP engine in the 66 the heat riser has a hole in it, right
 at the bend. I have tried many different &quot;high heat&quot; exhaust repairs,
 but as of yet, nothing has worked for more than 3 days. Has anyone
 else been able to repair this piece? I found plenty of articles in the
 archives about cleaning out a blocked tube, but didn't stumble across
 any repair questions.  &gt;&gt;
................

I'd replace it.  You should be able to find a used one cheep
