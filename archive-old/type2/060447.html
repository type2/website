Beautiful cold crisp morning here in the Dallas Fort Worth Metroplex.  You
know it is a good day when driving to work in your beloved VW (mine is a 73
Bus) you encounter two other fanatic VW owners  just like you.  Yep, one in
a 69 Bus and the other in a Splittie. They too must be daily drivers
because I see them frequently on my morning drive time.

Hope everyone has a great day.
