I'm hardly an authority on this, but AFAIK, those meters don't really work
very well, anyway.

(I'm assuming here that you've got a meter of some sort that you plug into
an oxygen sensor...  that's the only kind I've ever heard of short of an
infrared exhaust-gas analyzer, and those are _expensive_)

I read an archived discussion somewhere, I think from diy_efi (I can't find
the reference right now, but I can look around some more if you're
interested), that stated that a lambda sensor can't accurately measure
oxygen content.  It can tell when you have the correct amount of oxygen, and
when you're too rich, but it has no idea whatsoever when your mixture is too
lean.  Also, the O2/voltage relationship is apparently nonlinear, and varies
greatly in response to a number of factors.

The one-wire and three-wire sensors are basically the same.  The only
difference between the two is that the three-wire sensor has a heating
element in it so that it doesn't need to be heated by hot exhaust gases (O2
sensors need to be hot to function), and can therefore be placed farther
from the exhaust port.

As for getting a gauge to display what the EGO says, you'd probably get more
information by reading what the diy_efi (do it yourself electronic fuel
injection) archives have to say about O2 sensors and then hooking a digital
multimeter up to one and just measuring the output voltage (&quot;correct&quot; O2
content is apparently somewhere around 1v, though like I said, I'm certainly
not an authority).

There's apparently a mythical device called a UEGO that is capable of fairly
accurate O2 content measurements in both directions, but they're also really
expensive (though not as expensive as a $30k exhaust analyzer).

Good luck, anyway...
