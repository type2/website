If you are refering to the regular fridge on the westy, can report on my '82
Vanagon fridge.  Typically it will get cold overnight and run for over two
weeks in hot (hot) weather on a single fill-up of propane.  I sometimes will
run an extension cord to the bus and run it on AC current when parked at
home and run around town with cool beverages while not running the fridge on
propane.  I've used the propane while camping but last year I let it run
constantly just to see how long it lasted.
