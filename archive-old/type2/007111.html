Subject: Re: [T2] Electrical anomaly

Hi Will,

I once had a similar problem where all ignitition switched electrical items except the starter refused to work. Turned out to be a bad connection at the back of the ignition switch.

However your problem is all electrics failing including the 'idiot' lights in this case I would check to see if the nut holding the battery, alternator and fusebox leads onto the starter had come loose - after 1500miles  on a new starter the nut could easily have just worked loose.

Good luck

&gt; Labor Day greetings, Volks fellows,
&gt; 
&gt; My '74 Riviera got crochety and altered my holiday plans by refusing to run
&gt; after a few minutes. Had charged the battery and replaced it, cranked a few
&gt; times to get gas in the carb (it had been sitting idle for a while) then
&gt; started and ran but the idle was all over the place and I had to keep
&gt; goosing it when waiting for traffic lights. Not unusual since its PO had
&gt; installed a Weber Progressive and 009 dizzy.
&gt; 
&gt; But after running for 15 minutes and coming to another stop, the engine quit
&gt; and when I tried to start there was no electrical power at all. Turning the
&gt; key to start had no effect - the warning lights didn't even come on. Trying
&gt; to start by coasting downhill and letting out the clutch w/ key on didn't
&gt; work - again not even warning lights.
&gt; 
&gt; After sitting a bit power was surprisingly restored to operate headlights
&gt; but when I tried to start, after the starter engaged .5 second, no power
&gt; again. Battery has been load tested and has charge measuring 12.7 volts. All
&gt; connections, ground and hot, are bright clean. Has hot start relay, all
&gt; fuses everywhere are checked and good, the starter is a relatively new (not
&gt; refurbished) Bosch about 1500 miles old. Thanks if you have any ideas/cures.
&gt; 
&gt; -Will Holt
