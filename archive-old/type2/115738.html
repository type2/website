Subject: FS:  86 Vanagon Syncro - Seattle - $3445 offers/trades

1986 VW Vanagon GL Syncro 4WD Van.  Syncro 4 wheel drive/all wheel drive
system.  130K miles.  2.1L Waterboxxer engine.  7 passenger seating.
Overall decent condition.  Runs/drives good.  Normal wear &amp; tear - minor
body damage (dings/scratches) - minor interior imperfections (no serious
tears).  5 speed manual tranny with &quot;granny&quot; low gear.  Bently official VW
Vanagon/Syncro factory workshop manual.  Medium blue metallic with silver
beltline stripe.  Blue/Black interior.  Decent Michelin X radials.  New Tag.
Great on-line worldwide Vanagon &amp; Syncro enthusiast resources.

I can email pictures - or - see the van on the web at:
http://students.washington_dot_edu/hccarter/syncro/

I hate to sell this rig - I always wanted a 4WD Van and I was going to turn
the Syncro into a semi-serious, off-road/trekking vehicle.  However, I just
got a good deal on a newer Jeep that needs some work -so- the 4WD Van
project will have to wait a while.  Need the money and one project at a
time!

The Air Conditioning does not work.  To convert to an off-roader I had
started to remove the air conditioning.  The A/C is not really neccessary in
Seattle -or- for off-road situations -so- I started to remove some of the
A/C parts from the interior (primarily ducting &amp; the rear evaporator/fan
unit).  I have NOT yet removed any of the primary A/C mechanical components
(condensor/compressor/hoses/etc.)  So - since I decided to sell the van - I
can either leave the A/C on - or finish removing it - your choice.

I have researched Syncro pricing in the US and I am pricing the van
agressively.  I am asking $3445.  I will beat the price on any &quot;legitimate&quot;,
roughly comparable good running Syncro Vanagon.  Also, I am also running
this sale as a reverse auction - NO EBAY!!!  I am starting at a known top
price - $3445.  The price will be REDUCED by $100 every week - until it
sells (or until the price gets down to $2245) at which point I will just
keep the Syncro and take it off the market.  I will also consider all offers
and trades or partial-trades+cash (smaller car/truck/motorcycle, TIG welder,
or ???).

I can help deliver in a reasonable radius around the Seattle area - Thanks -
HC
