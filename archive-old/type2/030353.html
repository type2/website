Joe,

My personal theory is that in addition to seat problems, the t4 heads also
have valve guide problems.  What happens is that as they age, and the
valve guide clearances grow, the amount of blowby in them gets enormous.  
This pressurizes the case to a fare-thee-well and cooks the pushrod tube
o-rings, which then start to leak.  Replacments only last for a couple
hundred miles because the heat and pressure are still there :-( Eventually
you resign your self, the engine gets incredibly oily, cooling goes to
hell and then... then one time you slip, the oil gets too low and bang
there goes a valve seat.

I would say if you have a dirty engine with high miles, in addition to
replacing the seals (and, yes, there is one behind the fan as well as the
usual suspects behind the oil cooler and flywheel), that you should pull a
couple of the exhaust valve springs and check the clearance on the guides.
I'll bet that new guides are in order, or at least knurling on the old
ones (I don't approve of knurling, tho)

I don't know what to advise on the P&amp;C's...  yes, they are expensive, but
tho VW says that hone and ring is valid, in real life hone and ring
rebuilds tend to be 30K mile rebuilds :-( and your compressions sound
fine, but how many miles has this engine got on it?  80?  100?  125?

I would advise the following head checks first:

Lay a straight edge arross the stems.  see if any are proud.  If you got a
dying exhaust valve seat, then you will need new heads.

Pop the springs off the heads and see if the amount of rock is too high
(I'll bet it is!)

Since the heads are going in for studs, guides are pretty trivial.

On the P&amp;C's, either stick with what you have or replace.  Don't re-ring.
Measure the skirts for collapse.  measure the rings for wear.  Make up
your mind whether you can live with what you find.

Most of the 1800 gaskets are fine for a 2L.  The one difference I can
think of is the thick/thin intake manifold gaskets.  (I am also thinking
there is another one that's off, but can't remember which)
