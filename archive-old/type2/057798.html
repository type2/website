Subject: 79 exhaust/HX questions

I've got a 79 California (engine code GE) bus with the funky left heat
exchanger/U-tube oxygen sensor setup.  From Ron's post, it appears that the
funky parts are no longer available.  Can the Federal (other 49 states)
setup for the left heat exchanger/cat be substituted on my car?  If so,
what about the oxygen sensor?  Does anyone know why the cat was moved to
under the head for the California setup (seems like a bad place)?    I'm
luck enough to live in a state that does not require emissions testing, but
would prefer to keep my emissions low anyway, so I think the cat is a good
idea.  Eliminating the oxygen sensor with the federal configuration makes
me wonder whether the engine will perform properly.  All suggestions,
advice, opinions or just plain BS will be considered.
