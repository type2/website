Hi Volks!

Having given away my quite rough '71 Panel Van to a pal
in the Netherlands, I yesterday acquired its replacement:
a '76 Westfalia Wide-bed Pickup, plus long-wood trailer,
plus trailer hitch, minus engine and inspection.

The truck (Hey! Finally a truck! No more &quot;Panel Van Nazi&quot;
for this listee, finally! :-) is in rather good condition 
for German circumstance, i.e., it doesn't have any rust 
above the wheel wells.  ;-) It also has original 60k 
kilometres only, original taiga green paint, very nice 
interior, and the original Westfalia sticker on the rear 
bed flap.  In other words, it's quite presentable.

The long-wood trailer is a '66, in quite rough condition.
But there's little to be done on it anyway -- nothing
much that can break, in other words.  Almost complete,
hey, that's something.  Sandblast, paint, wire, done.

And the whole package was mine for just DM 150, or about
US$ 70.  Strrike!  (It's going to cost garage space rent
though.  I'm cheerfully ignoring the fact for the time
being.)

Sorry, I just needed to share.  Pics shall be made
sometime soon, I hope.

Airhowlingly yours,
   Erik.

Extreme?  Who, me?
