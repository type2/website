Subject: RE: [T2] Distributor position ?

Short answer, yes you can do it and it will work.

However,IIRC I think that the lobes on the distributer
shaft that actuate the points may not all be same.  I
think that maybe one of them is cut a little
differently to provide a slightly different timing or
dwell to one of the cylinders (maybe #3 the hot one?)

Hopefully somebody knows for sure?

&lt;SNIP&gt;
I would like to rotate the assy 90 degrees CW so that
the CSV connector is no longer is blocked. It seems to
me this should be possible if I also move the spark
plug wires by 90 degrees CW. Should this work, or are
there other factors wrt distributor orientation that
would prevent it?
