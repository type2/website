Subject: Replacing clutch, tranny - and flywheel?

After putting up with a noisy throw out bearing (at least that is what
thought it was) that resulted in a dead clutch, I finally pulled engine and
tranny today. Turns out that the pilot bearing may have been the original
culprit - the inner race was worn paper thin and the rollers had
disintegrated ripping the lining on both sides off the disc. Interesting
enough, both the flywheel and pressure plate surfaces seem not to have
suffered ...
 
Anyway, the tranny input shaft has plenty of play and so do the axles
flanges, so this may be a good opportunity to replace this 74 tranny with a
later one and profit from the taller gearing. This is my constellation: 74
bus, 2L engine on steroids, 74 flywheel with 215mm clutch. Since I need a
new clutch kit anyway, I could swap the flywheel with a 228mm one and use
the later clutch. What are the pros and cons?
 
Regarding endplay - what do I need to measure and adjust that correctly? I
know that I will have deal with that if I do replace the fywheel and I do
not have the rig and dial gauge pictured in the Bentley book. Does anyone
around DC have this measuring rig?
