Subject: No luck in Provo, but AAA comes through

I really appreciate all of the offers for help. It's great to see that there 
are so many people that are willing to help. It's really inspriring. 
Unforunately my wife Karen broke down at night in the rain in nowhere Utah, 
but fortunately AAA towed her from 30mi south of Provo all the way to SLC no 
extra charge. We sure get our money worth from AAA.

Thanks again for all the help!
