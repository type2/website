Subject: Starter help needed-70 Bus

I'm going to change out my unreliable starter. I bought a rebuilt Bosch 
starter with a new bushing.

1)   Best way of getting the old starter bushing out? (I may or may not be 
dropping the engine this wknd.)
2)   Best way of pressing the new one in? (put bushing on starter motor 
shaft and tighten bolts? Good idea or no?)
3)   For the battery negative cable, does it matter that I have a normal 
battery cable, attached solidly to a seat belt bolt under my back set, or is
there some reason why I should have a braided type ground strap?

All connections are clean and tight.
