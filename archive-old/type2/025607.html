Hi Volks,

I towed a 79 van (no pop-top, interior filled to burstin') about 700 miles
on a tow-dolly, running about 70 MPH on the interstate when/where traffic
allowed. I checked the tires and tiedowns about every 100 miles, but much
more often at first. I also removed the rear axels. It was a spring Sunday
on the east coast, and I got home in about 14 hrs, including 3 meals and an
hour lost at customs.



Happy trails,

Greg Potts

&gt; 
&gt; I towed a manual westy for 400 miles with the front wheels on a tow dolly
&gt; ....no problem - I just kept the speed to 45MPH maximum - I traveled during
&gt; the night too so as to cause less hassle to other freeway users.  I think
&gt; raising the rear wheels onto the dolly would make the van track across the
&gt; road unless you can figure a way to lock the front wheels into position ~ I
&gt; can't see why you would want to tow that way in the first place though ...-
&gt; Think of it like this ...The bus is designed to travel with the rear wheels
&gt; last!
&gt; 
&gt; If its an auto. bus then its different ... &amp; I've no experience there.
