Subject: Fuel injectors

What do people do to replace the rubber hose on the injectors? I've got my
'78 engine out right now, and I'm thinking about replacing ALL of the fuel
lines, since the previous owner had to replace some of them when they
developed leaks. He said it was squirting gas all over the place and he was
lucky it didn't catch fire.
