Christian Figenschaou recently posted a call to submit a vote on the
proposed newsgroup &quot;rec.music.white-power&quot;.  After reading the post, which
included the phrase &quot;on February 21&quot; I was a bit worried that the post,
however worthy, was out of date, so I wrote to &quot;group-mentors-owner_at_
acpub.duke_dot_edu, who are the official conductors of new newsgroup votes. I
recieved the attached response.  Whatever your feelings (and I hope they
mirror mine and chris' :-), it is way too late.

&gt; Is there currently a vote being conducted for the creation of a 
&gt; newsgroup named &quot;rec.music.white-power&quot;?  I recently recieved e-mail 
&gt; requesting my vote on this group and before I go off and do so, I would
&gt; like to know if I am in time, or if this mail was outdated, and the vote
&gt; is complete. 

No, it is outdated, and fortunately the group failed by something like 500
to 40,000 votes.
