Subject: &lt;F&gt; VW, but non-bus, manuals FS

Rather than *bay these things, I thought I'd give you folks a shot...
2 copies,  Rabbit, Scirocco, Jetta Bentley service manuals SEALED. Includes
P/up; 80-84.
1 copy, Rabbit, Jetta Diesel Bentley; includes p/up and turbo, 77-84. Sealed.
Does $20, and I pay shipping, sound too much? Pricetag on them from many
moons ago reads $30...

ALSO:
Sealed Haynes for the Porsche 944, 83-86.
Hynes for the VW Dasher, 74-81.(spine is a little sun-faded)
Haynes for the VW Rabbit, etc, 75-89.
Haynes for the Audi 5000, 84-88.
All never used.
$5 _at_ + shipping.

First holler, first served.

Thanks!
