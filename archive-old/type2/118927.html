&gt;  OEVW German backing plates for $60 each. That
&gt;  compares in price to a pair of Brazil plates for $100.

I can't say for sure but I'd be extremely shocked if these were German
made. I have not seen true German ones in years. (Remember that many
genuine VW bus parts sold in Germany are actually Brazilian made, so
even sourcing from Germany does not necessarily imply that a part is in
fact German.)
