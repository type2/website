Subject: acceptable torque wrench tolerances

Hi all, 
last night I finally lashed out and bought myself a torque wrench at a sale. 
My odometer is just about to tick back over to 0, so I thought my car deserved 
a present :-)

It is one of those ones that clicks when you reach the preset torque. Anyway, 
I got it home and read the blurb, and noticed that the tolerance on it was 
plus or minus 4%. The torque ranges from 10 - 150 ft-pounds.

I am wondering if this is acceptable, because (unmechanically inclined as I 
am) I would have thought that was a pretty high error range.

TIA
