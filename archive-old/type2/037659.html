Hi Scott &amp; list...
I'll answer what I know OK?
First do you have FI or carburators?
I assume carburators!
&gt; Hello all,
&gt;   I was out working on my 74 kombi this weekend and now
&gt; have some questons.
&gt;   On the stock air cleaner set-up there is a flapper
&gt; valve
&gt; that directs hot air from under the engine ito the
&gt; aircleaner or cool air. The cool air hose is gone, what
&gt; did
&gt; it look like and where did it go to? I see there are
&gt; small
&gt; brackets above the battery, did the hose clamp on to
&gt; there
&gt; somehow? What size hose is it?

hose is about 40cm long and is connected to the aircleaner but only takes
the air from above the battery, the air which comes in when you drive the
car... fresh air let's say!

&gt;   Same air cleaner, the small valve that directs vacuum
&gt; to the valve, which hose goes to the flapper valve and where
&gt; does the other one go?

To your right carburator!

&gt; Where does it get is vacuum? There
&gt; are two nipples that come out, one black plastic, the
&gt; other
&gt; brass.

It has always been told to me that it makes no difference which is connected
to which...!

&gt;   The evap. canister, where do the hoses go on that
&gt; thing.
&gt; I would like to hook it up, but all the hoses are
&gt; disconected. The can has one end with a big hose and a
&gt; small hose, the other has one big one. The air cleaner
&gt; has
&gt; two big hoses coming out of the center box, and the fan
&gt; shroud has a big hose fitting too, whats up?
&gt;    The heat sheild above the muffler, should I have one
&gt; if
&gt; I am running an Exstractor type muffler? Mine is missing
&gt; and I don't want to install one if it won't gain
&gt; anything,
&gt; but want it if I need it.
&gt;   One more. The small lines that go across the top of the
&gt; engine bay from side to side, they meet in the middle
&gt; into
&gt; a 'T' connector. The 'T' is bad and there is nothing
&gt; connected to it, where does it go?

This goes to the upper part of the air cleaner as a relief, it can breath
there!!
important to connect that because it is connected with your fuel
expansionsystem: look in the manual for that!


&gt;    I have looked in the Library, Bently and in Haynes. I
&gt; could not find any good diagrams of the hose routing. Any
&gt; web sites with good pictures?

Not that I know yet but there must be some....
In the manual from VW itself with all the different parts this is well
shown...
The maula with all parts numbers and parts diagrams...

&gt;   I may have more, I am getting this thing ready to go on
&gt; a
&gt; long trip and want it to be as right as possible.
&gt;

Good luck, if u have more I'm happy to help u if I can...
Indicate next time in an add what type u have, 2L or FI, stock ignition...
is more easy for people to respond!!!
