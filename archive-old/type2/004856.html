Subject: Dwell Angle w/ Electronic Igition
Message-ID: &lt;007a022f39d8$f070cc20$b4591b3f_at_default&gt;

While we are on the subject of dwell and EI, I have a Pertronix equivelant
that I purchased at the FLAPS.  Cant remember the brand off the top of my
head. Anyway, i was wondering if the dwell reading is relevant any more.
When I hook up the meter i get a 60 as opposed to the 50 w/points. I asked
the sales person about this and he just said &quot;it is made for all point
distributors.&quot;  That's all he said, sounded kinda fishy to me. I have a 009
in a 1980 carbeurated Vanagon (i know i should be shot but i dont have the
$$ to chance buying a stock dizzy and it not working with the Weber's
vaccume port). So does any one else have a different dwell reading w/EI or
do I need to get a new unit made for 009s? I asked this question a couple
months ago but didn't get any real answers.

Thanks
