Subject: Re: [T2] Window scraper

Richard,

My inside and out ones came from Bus-depot and came sealed
inside original VW/Audi bags.  They are extremely easy to get
bent in shipping, so this is one of those things that you really should 
pick up personally if possible.

The outside ones fit fairly well, but the inside ones were a royal
PITA to get put into the holes.  The inside ones did  not fit my 78 well 
at the ventwing end, so I had to trim them a little.  

They are supposed to end flush with  the vent wing channel.

The outside ones are alos *not* made as the original.

Cheers, dave
