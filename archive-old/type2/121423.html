Subject: Re: [T2] 3 Things I Really LOVE About Driving a Bus!

Hi Mike,

Happy Friday!!!

I would add one more thing to that list:

***Winter Hand-brake turns***

On a deserted snowy side-street I will approach a driveway at the usual 
speed, but when about 60-80' away I turn the steering wheel slightly 
and yank back hard on the e-Brake. The rear wheels lock, the bus 
fishtails around, and when it comes to a stop I find myself pointing 
straight up the driveway. I prefer to back up driveways, but that isn't 
any harder to arrange, you just turn the steering the other way. 
Downshifting to 1st (or reverse) while you're sliding makes this 
maneuver look really slick, although it still scares the crap out of 
passengers.

Be sure to assess traffic and road conditions carefully before you 
attempt this. A couple of years back I tried this in front of my house 
and because of the glare ice buildup that had accumulated there in my 
absence I executed a 450 degree turn instead of the 90 that I intended. 
Whoopsie!!

Practicing in a deserted parking lot is a good way to learn new winter 
driving moves, and I give myself an annual refresher course when the 
opportunity presents itself.

Happy trails,

Greg Potts

&gt; Three things I really love about driving a bus:
&gt;
&gt; 1.  Speed bumps.  Really big ones.  The nastier the better!  I love 
&gt; watching
&gt; all the $30,000 SUV drivers slow down to a crawl to go over them while 
&gt; I hit
&gt; them at 20 MPH and barely notice them.
&gt;
&gt; 2.  Pulling up to a brick wall or an overhang with a front-seat 
&gt; passenger
&gt; who's not used to being in a bus.  If you haven't done this, I highly
&gt; recommend it!
&gt;
&gt; 3.  Fish-tailing in a snowy parking lot.  There's no other vehicle on 
&gt; the
&gt; road that feels quite like a bus when you get the backend hung out 
&gt; good.
&gt; Must have to do with sitting right over the front wheels, but it makes 
&gt; for a
&gt; really unique sensation.
