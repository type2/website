Ted, Fred, and anyone else listening....

I agree strongly that a vacuum guage is a vital and much under-used piece
of diagnostic equipment!  I don't have a permanent installation, but boy
if your bus ain't idling right and you hook up the vac guage and it says
10&quot; of vacuum.... it's time to start hunting that vacuum leak!  OTOH, if
it is up in the normal range, then start with the ignition end.  Saves
many an hour of wrench time to know where to look first!

I would be curious to know from anyone if y'all get the same vac reading
as I at idle.  I regularly get 15-17&quot; which my guage says is &quot;late
timing&quot;.  This does not worry me, because the pre-print is for big V-8's
and by their standards our timing is definitely way retarded.  But I do
wonder :-)

These are the very words she uses to describe her life
She said a good day ain't got no rain
She said a bad day's when I lie in the bed
