Subject: [T2] Rebuild vs. replace

Eventually I am gong to have to do something with the engine in my 74
Westy.
I need to get serious about fixing the oil leaks, if I can find them all.
And she blows a fair amount of smoke when first started.  A fresh engine
would be nice,,,, I need to determine the cost difference between trying
to rebuild one myself, or buying a good rebuild longblock from one of the
vendors.
Can anyone give me a ball park figure on what I could expect to spend if
I were to attempt to rebuild it on my own?

I am a little reluctant to tackle it on my own, before I owned a VW I
never even changed my own oil.
