Subject: Re: [T2] Late model VW electronic ignition questions.

[...]

&gt; I've still got some questions about the coil... everyone is saying that if I
&gt; have the &quot;stock&quot; points ignition on my '78 bus then the blue coil is the
&gt; correct replacement, but what if I've replaced the points with an electronic
&gt; setup (Crane)? Is the blue coil still the correct coil? Thanks for any info,

I pmailed you earlier about this. Did you not receive it?
Here is what I sent:

As far as I know, most all after-market electronic ign swap-over kits use the
standard coil. Did you get install directions with your Crane kit?
Here is an ad for Crane Fireball Ignition. Is this what you have?
http://www.maccar_dot_com/craneign.html
At the bottom, it lists Crane coils....
Here is someones write-up about Crane coils:
http://www.240sx_dot_org/links/product-review/engine/ignition/bill.htm
Here is another Crane ignition:
http://british.nerp_dot_net/car/proc/ignition1.html
The next page of this site has the Crane install instructions:
http://british.nerp_dot_net/car/proc/ignition2.html
It does not specify replacing the coil.....
