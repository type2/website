Mexican buses have subtle differences from older US buses.  I've a feeling
that the Customs people, seeing them all the time, would be likely to know
about them.

If you lose the game, customs takes your new bus and assesses a fine as
well.  Is it worth the risk?

A safer route is to have a Mexican national drive the Mexican-registered
bus across the border, then have it &quot;lost&quot;.  Then you can do whatever
VIN wizardry you wish.
