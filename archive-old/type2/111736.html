Subject: Re: [T2] SCCA

Damn, that's an awesome story. Actually.. it makes me WANT to autocross
the Bus just so that I can learn to be a better driver. I've had similar
experiences (not in a VW Bus) and what I do now is whenever I'm going to
pass someone, and I can't see what's going on, if I absolutely can't see
everything in front of me, I don't even bother.

There was this one time when I was in my Pontiac Fiero. (I was 18).
Similar type road, but it DID have a center idiot zone lane (for
breakdowns etc). It's about 8:00 at night, I'm behind a minivan. This SUV
in the car to my right is going really slow, so I quickly get into his
lane (in front of him) to pass the minivan that's in front of me. 

Well.. at that split second, I'm going about 45 miles an hour (speedlimit
was 45 too actually). The second I pulled in there, I realized... right
there in front of me, about 10 feet, is an old small Toyoto or something
pickup truck sitting at a dead stop with a guy squatting directly behind
it. I'm 10 feet away from hitting this truck.. I'm going 45 miles an
hour, and I'm 10 feet behind him and he's at a dead stop....

So obviously, I realize... I'm about to hit this guy.. and if I do, there
is literally no way that he's going to survive it. I would have literally
squashed the guy between my car and his car, and I'm only 10 feet away at
45mph from doing that. 

I had to think fast, I knew the minivan was to my left. At the very
least.. I figured, I could care less what happens to these cars, I just
DO NOT want to hit this guy. (I couldn't go on the shoulder because there
were a couple people standing right there too). So.. in a split second
decision, I pulled the wheel as hard as I could in the left lane. Now,
obviously.. a mid-engine sports car is a bit more forgiving in swerves
than a VW Camper is. 

Miraculously.. the minivan wasn't there, and I didn't hit ANYTHING.
Honestly.. I hate to admit it to you guys, but I think I came about 1-2
feet from the guy's back. I literally flew past him, doing 45 miles an
hour, 1-2 feet from hitting him. (by the time all the neural connections
happened and I reacted in time to pull into the other lane).

Honestly, I have no idea what happened to the minivan.. I didn't see it
anywhere in front of me, and I didn't see it anywhere behind me.

Out of the blue, this guy in a Ford LTD 2-door flew up behind me, and
then got up next to me screaming &quot;YOU ALMOST KILLED THAT GUY!!!&quot; He said
this about 30 times. He followed me all the way to my apartment complex.
I got up to the gate, and the guy got out of his car and ran up to my car
(I got the impression he was going to try to pull me out of the car and /
or beat me up). Luckily for me, my Fiero is low enough to the ground that
I was able to drive under the gate without having to use the card (slow).
So I slipped under the gate, and the guy got stuck there. I then slipped
out the second enterance and chilled at Mc.Donalds for about 15 minutes.

Anyway, technically I did nothing wrong.... this complete IDIOT stopped
his pickup truck right smack in the road, and stood behind his car when
there were cars passing. It was Darwin's Theory at it's best. The guy
SHOULD have moved...  I assume his car broke down.. so as he was coming
to a complete stop, he should have moved into the CENTER lane (it's a
large lane about the size of 1.5 lanes right in the middle for people
with broken down cars).. it's the breakdown lane.

But NOOO... 

Obviously, I was inexperienced enough that you don't pass when you can't
see what's going on... sure woke me up, I never fly into a lane to pass
unless I clearly know what's going on.

&gt;In the early 90's when my 73 Westy was fairly new to me, I used to joke
that
&gt;I should take it out and autocross it.  I was pretty good with my 87
Honda
&gt;Prelude SI and figured I could race just about anything.
&gt; 
&gt;Then one day I changed my mind.
