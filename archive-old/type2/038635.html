Subject: Some thoughts on buying...anything.

Hello Volks,

I was thinking I would share some about my experiences trying to sell my
72 high top that I posted about here.

After reading about so and so's problem buying a bus, I'm rather
inspired to comment on the buying / selling topic in general. My 2
cents, as they say. My comment is not, and should not, be considered as
a direct criticism regarding any specific list members current
situation.

First, my van is for sale and I hope the market is good, after all it is
always a buyer's market. Right ? The only person so far to come and test
drive it, I'm convinced, should never own a VW van. He was brutal on the
clutch and way over revved the engine before shifting. I couldn't wait
for him to get out of the driver's seat. I sell cars &quot;as is&quot; and  people
like this guy are the reason why.

I've sold lots of other cars and for some reason it can be the death of
any good friendship or friendly neighbor relationship. So, for that
reason I prefer to sell cars to people I don't know and will never see
again.

Second, I feel lucky and grateful that I am mechanically inclined. I can
fix most anything, usually most the time. I expound to my friends that
in this world of machines, a person who can, or at least tries, to fix
things has a huge advantage over the schmuck who won't try and who's
eyes glaze over when you explain to him (her) how easy or simple
something is/was to fix. Life will be more expensive for them.

Well, everybody is good at something. Everybody.

I suck at carpentry, computer programming, taking radios apart and tax
forms of any kind.  I am out of my league and I don't like wasting my
time and money trying to fake it. I know nothing about investing in gems
or stocks, nor do I want to attempt anything that requires me to study
or do homework.

That all said, whenever faced with such a scenario I usually PAY
somebody to know what to do. And in the event that I break that rule,
and take a chance on bankrolling something I'm not knowledgeable in,
then I do it with my fingers crossed to protect me from my stupidity.

If I may be allowed to give an opinion to the list about buying a car,
.... of any kind, let it be this .....

Unless you work on cars for your paychecks, don't take chances on
dropping big sums of money BEFORE getting a pre-purchase diagnosis and
opinion ......AND a warranty from the seller.......and even then, don't
invest more that you can afford to lose, should you make a mistake.

Sorry if I inadvertently offended anybody while I took the soapbox.
Rebuttals accepted.

peace
