&gt; Hey when we having this painting festival???

name the time and place, Mid Atlantic area please.....I'll bring the beer,
my air complessor and anything else, it is such a bear of a job and it is
a lot easier to just get each person to do a &quot;part&quot; of the job, guy #1
does all the prep, #2 does all the primer #3 does all the coating etc. bet
it would make one heck of a weekend project for a half dozen buses or
so...

&gt; Wouldn't be a bad idea seriously - for a half dozen bus folks to get together and paint a bunch of busses together at one time. Prob work really good for driver buses. Those show guys are a bit pickier of course!!! &lt;grin!&gt;
