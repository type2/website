&gt;relined disk- found lots of it caked to the flywheel (suspect it may
&gt;have caused the imbalance/vibration felt in the motor when revving it to
&gt;a CERTAIN rpm, or letting it go beyond that rpm and letting it drop
&gt;until that point).  (1) Is that possible? 

Yes, possible, but not conclusive.

 I had replaced the
&gt;flywheel/engine seal back at the clutch change 70K ago, but not the
&gt;trans seal, which appears to be the source of the oil film observed over
&gt;the bell housing and mixed with the lining material. 

The source of your clutch failure is the leaking seal. You can't blame a
Canadian clutch for not being able to function with gear lube on it. No dry
clutch disk manufacturer I know of makes one that will, not even the
boneheads in Germany.

  (2) Is antizieze compound allowed on a tapered
&gt;surface for reinstall??

Not called for, not needed, not advised. Clean, polished surfaces bone dry
is assumed for taper joint mating. Polished and preoiled for seals and
their surfaces.

  Pull flywheel back.  Turn
&gt;adjustor so it just touches flywheel.  Push flywheel in.  Use feeler
&gt;gauge to check play. (3) Can't do this until fan mount is back on, no? 

Only the flywheel mounting controls end play. Should make no difference if
the fan/hub is installed or not. Set up your end play, then after you
install the fan, verify end play has not changed. If it varies, you got a
procedure problem somewhere.

&gt;(4) Any other checks of determining wear that can be done without
&gt;further teardown?? 

Is pulling the valve covers and backing off the adjustment screws to
inspect lifter wear considered &quot;further teardown&quot;???? How about removing
the breather can to see just how much tar buildup is present??? Test the
intake nuts for tight as it is much easier with the motor out. If you are
fortunate enough to have it on a stand, drain the oil, flip the sucker over
and check the exhaust port fasteners/pipes/muffler and replace the cooroded
nuts one at a time. That way the gaskets have the best chance of
maintaining seal with no problems. If you see a bit of black anywhere,
replace the gasket.   
 
&gt;   BTW, while vacuuming the engine crevaces, I found this red heavy
&gt;gauge wire with no connector, just bare coppper- and then DOH, realized
&gt;I never pulled that connector wich is still fastened to the starter!

ME TOO. I did this recently on a motor pull. Quick to fix with a new
terminal, thank Hermes.

&gt;Got the LUK clutch replacement kit from Ron's- it includes a pilot
&gt;bearing and Brazilian throwout bearing.  Very heavy looking pressure
&gt;plate and disk.   (5) Being extra thick, will any of this affect the
&gt;throwout bearing clearance, or is there enough room in fully backed
&gt;bearing fork to allow this??  

If the dimensions are not spec, there may be a problem, but LUK is German
OEM just as is Ficktel/Sachs and I would be very suprized if they didn't
fitup properly. Thickness of the metal is not of concern as long as the
installed positions of things are within tolerance. Inspect the cross shaft
closely. Bushings snug and finger wear not excessive or unbalanced. A
cockeyed TO bearing due to being out of plane can make for a very short
clutch life.
