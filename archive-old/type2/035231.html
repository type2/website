Subject: Specs for distributor rebuild

Volks,

I am in the process of rebuilding a distributor and Bentley has turned out
to be of little help :-(  the rebuild kit has a selection of shims, but
nowhere can I find the end play spec.  This dist has ~.2&quot; which has *got*
to be way too much! But what is right???  is it a general spec like the 50
dwell or is it distributor specific?  If so, this is an 021 905 205 E dist
from a '73 dual carb 1700.  Per David Easterwood, the specs are listed in
the shop manual, Volume K.
