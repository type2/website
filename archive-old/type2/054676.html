Yes
 The upper inlet is the one from the tank, should have an arrow stamped on
it facing toward the pump ( you may have a decal that is covering the arrow)
the lower one is the outlet to the carb.......

Subject: Fuel pump Question


&gt; I am putting an alternator on an upright engine and using the Bocar, hecho
&gt; en Mexico, fuel pump.
&gt; Are the 2 pump nipples reversed?
&gt; On the old pump, the inlet line screwed in the lower section. Is the lower
&gt; section on the new pump the inlet side?
&gt; I seem to remember a post a few years back that said you needed to invert
&gt; the hoses, but I couldn't find it in the archives.
