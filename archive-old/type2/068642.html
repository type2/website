Subject: RE: Anyone in Madison?

I live in madison AND I own a bus AND I'm proud of it!  Owning a bus in Madison, WI just seems right.  What kind of busses do 
the rest of you have, we have probably waved to each other on the street. I'm the one in the '72 orange with primer hardtop 
camper.  E-mail me if any of you would ever like to get together for beers and Volksie stories.
