Subject: Perplexing Oil Leak(s)

I drove a 78 bus back from Provo and it had a slight oil leak right under
the coil that was easily managed by checking and adding to the oil every
time I stopped for gas.  Right now it won't hold oil for more than 2 minutes
and leaks from the following places: under the coil, from above the heater
box for pistons 3 &amp; 4 and from the front (or is it rear, next to tranny)
main seal.

The concern that I have is that there is something wrong with the engine
that caused all of this to happen at once.  I've checked the compression and
it is fine.  The engine was running great when all of the leaks started and
it still starts up and runs beautifully.  It just doesn't hold oil.  I've
purchased the complete gasket set from Bus Depot
(http://www.busdepot_dot_com/busdepot/details.jsp?partnumber=029198009) and soon
I'll be taking the engine out to repair it.  Is there anything that I should
be looking for?

Many thanks in advance,
