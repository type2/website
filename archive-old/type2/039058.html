Subject: pop top bow

You ever have one of those &quot;oops&quot; experiences?  Tonight, after our big
area band concert ( I'm a H.S. band director and we had both middle
schools and a whole lot of elementary school band on the floor of our
gym, about 300 kids) one of my students was showing off her remote
starter for her Cadillac.  I quickly hopped into my '69 Westy, grabbed
the right tie down and popped it loose, grabbed the left tie down and
popped it loose, grabbed the back tie down and heard something go  pop
and thought &quot;oops.&quot;. The rear bow on my pop top has become separated
from the fiberglass.  How are these wood strips attached and by what
method does one reattach them?

Thanks,

Steve
