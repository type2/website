In the long run, the best costs the least in tools, especially for three
generations of do-it-yourselfer Joneses. Fair value and good results for
Grandad, great value and good results for son, and heirloom value and good
results for the grandson who recognizes the wisdom of his Grandad.

&gt;30 years ago I read in a M*otocycling magazine the old saying that Craftsman
&gt;tools were &quot;... 3/4 the best tools you could buy for 1/2 the money.&quot;  

Indeed. Very good description of US made Craftsman as a rule of thumb. I
think both the 3/4 and 1/2 are a bit high for today. Compared to S-K etal
perhaps, but compared to SnapOn etal, it's more like 1/2 the best tools for
1/3rd the money. For any DM machine, DIN Hazet would be 9/8 the vaule of
SnapOn at 7/8 the cost. IMAAAO
 . . . . .
(Anals beware. Reading further can cause colic. Those who don't like
wizbang, hit delete, err, that should be, those that don't like the 'word'
wizbang, hit delete. Ohh, you know what I mean. YOU decide.)
 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .On financing the better quality tools, consider that one breakdown from
lack of maintenance that causes a days lost wages a tow and a repair bill
will pay for a hellofa nice set of SnapOn wrenches and/or sockets. Add to
that the cost to your reputation if it happens three times per year. There
are only two rational choices. Pay to have the maintenance inpections done
properly or pay the money for tools and time to learn so you can maintain
it even better by finding all problems on the hoizon and resolving them
before they break.

I also suggest you try to review the workshop manual for any vehicle you
consider buying BEFORE you buy it, then if you buy the vehicle, the next
purchase is the manual, then spending several evenings of more detailed
research. Along the way, you will learn much about the tools required to
service the vehicle before you shell out that cash on something you just
don't need. The Haynes manuals are very good about showing how to use
common tools where a factory special tool is called for by the Bentley.

Spend time/money on knowledge first (research Bentley/Haynes), then reflect
on the new knowledge and existing knowledge (analysis, understanding), then
do 10% more time/money research (buy Muir and read it) and with better
understanding and a refined knowledge base (this makes 90% chance of
success 99%), draw your conclusions and take action with confidence that
you KNOW what your a doing with you hard won dollars. You lay the
foundation for good results, bottom line actual cost for best chance at
maximum value received. Same knowledge base provides both for hiring a
mechanic or being the mechanic. 

Whether buyin' Vdub tools or a good used candidate for repair and
maintenance or finding a good mechanic before you need him, monkey see
monkey do is the instinct to follow. Watch the apes that know the most
about the subject, do it the way they do it, get the results they expect.
Results not good enough?? Refine their methode. Refinement of design is
required for better results.   

Too much work? Start hitting the banners!! ($10,000 first month, EASY
method!!) Make some banners, yurself!! Make a-lots-a-money or earn alots-a
money, or steal it fair and square from fools. Find the best mechanic in
the Tri-State region. Move there. Put him on retainer to service your new
Mercedes. That takes care of the daily driver. 

Then pursue your Vdub hobby with next months gains on the hits. Buy the
Hazet Factory Configured VW set no different than that used on the factory
floor. Ohh yes, and the P-code tool boards for T-II. Then buy whatever
extra tools you need to service the wizbang, it's your hobby, it's allowed
for any legitimate disposable income. 

The versatility of the T-II's make them excellent candidates for life long
service under factory maintenance inspection alone. No 'oil changes', no
'tune ups', never a blown motor.
Rather than that, Lubrication Inspections, Short term Maintenance
Inspections, Long term Maintenance Inspections. See your Bentley manual for
the specifics.  They are worth buying tools &amp; manuals &amp; the investment of
time. They are also worth keeping a complete history for, documented (read,
data) which allows you to always know what the next Inspection will include
and what it won't and budget accordingly for the future event even if
special tools are involved that you don't have.

If I was 19 today, I would buy the best T-II I could find and the Custom
Hazet VW Factory Tool Set, finance it all up front, and keep it maintained
for life, then will the kit and kabodle in spec maintained order to the
list for a raffle.  Wonder what that would be worth???

I am sure it would have saved 'me' a whole lot-o-time/money to have
followed method without the few compromises I made early on.
