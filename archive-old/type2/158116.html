Did the  Norfolk
and Western sue O. Winston Link for selling photographs of  their
locomotives?



hey george     I am a norfolk and western(now Southern)  baby  my father was 
chief civil engineer for 25 years.   The  N&amp;W did get to use o'links pictures 
for adds. He was the only person other  than the CEO that could hold up a 
train from moving. They turned the old  passenger station in Roanoke Va into his 
museum . It is a must see if you are  ever in the Roanoke valley . back to 
working on buses  later  mark  dearing
