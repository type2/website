Subject: RE:  Alternator wiring harness?

&gt;I am in desperate need of a wiring harness for my alternator.  
&gt;Can't seem to find where to buy one, so I tried to make my own, 
&gt;which is evidently not working.  If someone could let me know 
&gt;where to go to get one, I would really appreciate it.

I burned up the wires on my alternator harness in my 914 several years ago
when I hooked up the battery backward (don't ask).  After a fruitless search
for a replacement, I built my own.  Just pulled the old wires free of the
3-way connectors, cripmed some new connectors onto new wires and shoved them
into the 3-ways.  Used slightly heavier wires than the old ones and replaced
the big red one that goes to the starter with a heavier gauge also.  No
problems for 6 years.
