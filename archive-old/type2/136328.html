Subject: Re: [T2] a dumb question about front vents

&gt; &gt; Hi,
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I'm heading over the river and through the woods
&gt; tomorrow.  My dash vents 
&gt; &gt; leak cold air in the bus.  Can I cover the grills
&gt; on the front of the bus with 
&gt; &gt; cardboard like the water cooled guys do?  Does
&gt; that air go anywhere else?
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Jacques
&gt; 
    
Each winter, I take the front grille off, wrap the
black plastic screen in plastic wrap (or Aluminum foil
one year), and re-install it.  The 6 screws holding
the painted grille to the bus just pop through the
plastic (or foil).  Zero cold-are intrusion into the
cab.  At least from the fresh air system.   :-o  A low
tech and very cheap solution.
