&gt; Well that was stupid!!!  Flywheel bolts coming out......   Can any one fill me
&gt; in on the RIGHT way to install the O ring and the Right size  it should be and
&gt; RIGHT spot It should go?  I would be most grateful!

I'm not sure it that incorrect o ring caused the loose bolts, but
anyway. With the flywheel out clutch side down, look on the inside of
the flat part which mates up against the crank. There is a little
valley in there which the correct oring fits in. Make sure you have
the old one out, else it won't fit. If the last one seemed like it
wouldn't fit, I can easily believe you have the old on in there. I
know because I went through the same thing. finally reaized that the
darn thing was actually in there, pulled it out &amp; oring went back in
w/ no problems.

Now with that fixed you should be able to put the shims back &amp; bolt it
together. One thing of note, the bolts that hold the flywheel on have
little &quot;grippers&quot; on the bottom of the heads. These dig into the
washer so that they stay put. I also put locktite there &amp; torqued them
appropriately. Check your end play while it's out (again) as well.
good luck.
