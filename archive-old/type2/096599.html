HI Folks,
	Anyone have a single 2 liter P&amp;C available (83 Vanagon).  

I pulled the 1&amp;2 side apart this weekend (102F here yesterday &quot;but it's
dry heat, yeah!&quot;.  The number 2 piston decided to leave a little bit of
its top land stuck to the cylinder wall, seized both compression rings and
a broken oil ring.  Still got 130psi when hot but the light tap, tap, tap
didn't 'feel' right. The #1 looks fine.  All else looks well enough to
leave alone.  Thanks. jon
