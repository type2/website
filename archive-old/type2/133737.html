Subject: RE: [T2] Pop top conversion, 73 to 74/79

Hi Ben,

Check out this site:

http://www.pottsfamily_dot_ca/westfakia/index.html

Greg Potts did a great conversion on an early Bay to the late-Bay-style 
poptop, and he took a lot of pics to show what's what.  He's real nice, and 
I'm sure he'd be happy to offer any advice.

Good Luck!
