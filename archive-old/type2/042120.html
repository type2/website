Subject: brake bleed

Marcus, I also have a 70 bus. Had the same problem. You almost can't
bleed the air out of the master cyl. through the wheel cyls. I found this   
out 
after i had everything assembled.The proper way is to bench bleed it before 
you put it on the bus. But all is not lost. Get under the front,grab the brake
peddle lever with your left hand ( if you are right handed ) pump a few times
and hold it. with your right lossen line at master cyl. that goes to rear 
brakes
just like bleeding wheel cyls. May take several times, air is hard to get out 
of master cyl. then do front. Dont touch the screw on master cyl. that is what
holds it together inside the master cyl. good luck  morris
