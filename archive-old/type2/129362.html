Subject: Re: [T2] Rebuilt 2.0 FI - worst case scenario - update

So.. after debating whether or not to tear the engine apart again and 
being warned to think carefully about it, I went ahead and dropped it 
and tore it apart..

Result - crank and webcam 107i were in perfect alignment - not one tooth 
off as I suspected.  Oh, the pain of it all...

Now I think what I was suffering from was the &quot;adjust the hydraulic 
valves as per Bentley&quot; syndrome. i.e. 2 full turns in past zero lash. I 
will now button it all up again, follow the Boston Bob method of 
hydraulic valve intitiation ( 
http://www.bostonengine_dot_com/articles/hydraulicll.htm ) which starts with 
.006&quot; SHORT of zero lash and tightens up in increments after running the 
engine.

I will also check the wiring harness 100% and re-check the temp II sensor.

Back to the garage to carefully reassemble.
