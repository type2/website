I like it, but not quite to my taste...Anybody familiar with the BGW Spectre
kit to convert a Bug into a Mini-Woodie? OK, anybody know if such a kit is
available for a the Van...I've seen a PT Cruiser with such a kit (and once
upon a time drove and worked on a real Mini Traveller/Clubman)...Any info
out there that can help?-)
Thanks in advance for any help in this search.
