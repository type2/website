Subject: Re: [T2] 78 Westy 2.0L engine weak fire

&gt;I checked the temp head sensor and it test ok. I also checked the
&gt;condensor and the coil and they seem ok also. Engine starts up ok and
&gt;then as it warms up the idle slows down and eventually dies. After it
&gt;warms up it idles ok and runs good on the road. Any thoughts as to what
&gt;may be causing this. All answers appreciated. Thanks

Vacuum leak that only happens when something finally gets warm. I'd check 
the idle air bypasss thingy-ma-bob too.

I had vacuum leaks in the gas tank venting system, injector seals, and EGR 
valve. I replaced the hoses, replaced the injector seals ($16), and blocked 
off the EGR valve saving all the pieces so I could reinstall at a later 
date in case TN gets smog testing.
