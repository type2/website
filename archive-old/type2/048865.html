Subject: [T2] heater pipes revisted, please help

Sorry to bring more heat stuff to the list but i need some info.  I have
the 72-74 style heat/exhaust system on my bus as you all know.  THe pipe
that go from heat exchanger to the flapper boxes on the drivers side are
supposedly the same for 72-79 but they do not fit properly on my bus, a
78.  the piece of metal that goes to the engine tin to support the pipe
does not meet up with the tin if attached to the exchanger, or if hooked
up to the exchanger does not meet up with the tin.  My thoughts are
either:
A. there is a different drivers side pipe for 72-74 (the one i have is
off a 76)
or
B. mine is somewhat damaged and warped.

when the pipe is on the tin it is about 2'' away from the exchanger
outlet.   I am tired of dealing with the damn heat and this is the last
major hurdle ( I hope, i get almost no airflow to the front but i assume
that is because only one side is connected, any thoughts)  I am anxious
to put the FI back in as soon as i get the heat squared away.  I
estimating 3-4 hours to put the FI back in. I've removed a complete FI
system in 1 hour.
If someone has a later and earlier style heat tube could they compare
them and tell me if they see a difference?
Any thoughts on anything mentioned here are welcome.
Thanks in advance !!
Jamie
