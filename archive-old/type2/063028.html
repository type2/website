Subject: Chemicals &amp; Safety (long)

&gt; &gt;keeps warning people about an allegedly very toxic substance
&gt; &gt;contained in the paint, but I didn't see any warnings on the can. 

Federal Law in the US says that the manufacturer of any product that
contains potentially harmful substances must write a document titled:
Manufacturer's Safety Data Sheet, MSDS for short.  I use these at 
work all the time.  They are supposed to be available for almost 
everything you can buy, except stuff that you eat or drink, or 
household cleaning materials (though some of these are REALLY nasty)
They contain the ingredients in the 
product (except when deemed to be proprietary), the potential damage 
they can inflict, and recommended PPE (Personal Protective 
Equipment) for the product, etc.
It tells what type of protective equipment is required, whether you 
need a HEPA (high Efficiency Particulate A?) filter for small 
particles such as asbestos or fibreglass, an organic respirator 
cartridge to eliminate the organics (solvent based stuff), or a 
cartridge for acids.  The type of glove material needed to resist 
the substance.  Warning here though, each glove manufacturer has it's 
own version of the same material and their recommendations for glove 
material may differ.

When I recently bought some paint for my house, I asked for the MSDS. 
They hesitated a minute as I was the first regular customer that 
had ever asked for one.  On orders to commercial businesses, they 
regularly provide the MSDS.  Sometimes they will BS you, saying that 
you don't need it, or say they don't have it handy.  Keep after them 
to get it.

I just check the MSDS for Acetone from JT Baker Co. 9 pages!
the MSDS is in 10 sections (the structure of the MSDS is mandated so 
that the similar information is always in the same place from 
different manufacturers)
1- Product ID, 2-Components, 3-Physical Data, 4-Fire and Explosion 
(including extinguishing), 5-Health Effects, 6-Reactivity, 7-Spill &amp; 
Disposal, 8-Industrial Protective Equipment, 9-Storage &amp; Handling, 
10-Transportation.  Lots of stuff in there.  If you have any trouble 
deciphering one, drop me a line.  I sit next to the department that 
tests this stuff and they have 10's of thousands of MSDS to keep 
track of on plant.

Tip- I use a dead refrigerator for storing my chemicals, two 
actually, one for paints and solvents, and another for the other 
stuff.  I screwed on a latch and keep it locked from the kids.
