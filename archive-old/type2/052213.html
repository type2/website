Subject: [T2] Front Wheel Bearing noise

List-
Haven't posted in a long time but I try to keep an eye on what is going on.
I have what I think is wheel bearing noise in the front end of my 72 Westy.
I hear it when I turn   but not when going straight. I took one hub apart
and all is well. However I can't figure out how to set the play that is
supposed to be there. Haynes says .03 -.12 mm at the spindle.  It also
says: &quot;This seems like a lot and can result in some quite noticible rock at
the outer rim of the wheel&quot;
How much rock? Does anyone have a procedure for getting this right? If
there is that much play maybe the bearing noise while turning is normal.
