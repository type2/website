&gt; That glue they use that's really gloopy and sticky but comes off without
&gt; leaving a mess - that would be ideal for this job.  Thing is, does anyone
&gt; know where to get it from?  

Here in Germany, it's little-known, but widely available under
the name of &quot;photo glue&quot;.  A common brand name is &quot;Fixogum&quot;,
green tube in a green cardbord box with white lettering on both.
Not exactly cheap though, your garden-variety glue tube (dunno,
maybe 200 ml or so) costs around 4 Euros.

Airhowlingly yours,
