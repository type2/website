Subject: I think I messed up...

So about a month ago, I wrote to the list asking for some help with stuck
exhaust nuts.  (This is a 1700cc dual carb).
Several people wrote saying to use a torch to heat it and chisel the nut
out.  As soon as I got those responses, I was called off to travel for about
6 weeks for work.
This past weekend I was finally able to get to work on the last nut that was
holding my mangled heater boxes on.  (Theres no actual box anymore..just the
j-tubes and ceramic heat sinks).
After a quick look at Muir, I mis-read &quot;butane tip&quot; as &quot;butane torch&quot;.  So
thinking I could save myself a trip to the store, I pulled out a lil butane
torch I had for electronic work (soldering/heat shrinking).
I tried heating the nut and using the chisel, but wound up just shaving off
the metal.
I'll try and clear this up with a basic drawing below:

 _| |_            | |
|_| |_|         /__ \


The &quot;picture&quot; on the left shows a normal stud/nut combo..the one on the
right shows what I'm stuck with now..a pyramidal nut.
So here's my question...If i get an actual propane torch, can I still get
that nut off with some heat and chisel?
If not, is there anything else I can do?  The nut is in a somewhat cramped
location, with pushrod tubes on both sides, and on the inside bend of the
exhaust J-tube.
The engine has already been pulled and is sitting in my dining room on a
700lb furniture dolly  (Thank God for understanding girlfriends) so
transporting it somewhere is not really an option.
Sorry for the long post, I'm very frustrated with myself.
Thanks in advance for all the help I'm sure I'll get..I love this list!
