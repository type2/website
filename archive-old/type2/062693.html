Subject: Re: paint it yourself

I've had two Vgons painted, one by Maaco, one by an independent that lots
of commercial places use for their trucks.  Around $400 in each case, for
one coat of primer and two of color, over my prep.  Very important to get
everything off that comes off -- bumpers, lights, door handles, etc.  The
actual application of paint was quite competent, but the masking is done
by blind sleepwalkers.  I think this level of job is a good choice if you
want the paint primarily for rust prevention and to look good from 20 feet
away around dusk.  Additional small increments of quality cost hundreds of
dollars and then where would you park?
