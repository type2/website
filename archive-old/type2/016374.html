Subject: Re: Wiper motor brushes

&gt;List,
&gt;In a moment of blaring idiocy, i took my wiper motor apart (75 camper).  
&gt;Man.  Does anyone know how to get those three magnet/brush daddies to 
&gt;stay the hell up in their little slots so's i can get the shaft back 
&gt;in without involving another person? ...

Clark,

One trick that I have used in rebuilding motors is to get some Dental
Tape, (like dental floss but wider and stronger).  You tie a loop around
the brush and its holder.  Tie a knot to secure this loop with a long
tail hanging outside of the motor away from the center.  You can use
these tails to pull on and pull the brushes away from the center of the
motor and then drop the armature in.  Depending upon the motor, you are
sometimes able to &quot;floss&quot; the brushes up and tie them to parts of the
motor frame and then drop the armature in place.  The dental floss is
handy as it is strong and thin and does not interfere with the armature
dropping in.  Once the armature it in, you can use a pair of sissors and
cut the floss.

Sometimes creative use of the tails and pulley points is required to
pull all the brushes with one hand and drop the armature in with the
other.  I have tied one tail to my bench, the wrapped the other in my
holding hand and then used the combination to simultaneously expand both
brushes and the drop the armature in with the free hand.

Good Luck
