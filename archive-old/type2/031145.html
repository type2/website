Subject: '83 clutch and valve problem(long)
Message-ID: &lt;Pine.LNX.3.96.990219181731.3522A-100000_at_excalibur.onate.nmhs_dot_edu&gt;

This is my first message to the list, so I hope I get it right!

The '83 aircooled vanagon that I've recently acquired is suffering from
two problems.  The first, a clutch that is not fully disengaging, the
second, what I think is a sticking exhaust valve.

The clutch problem was why the vehicle was originally pulled out of
service, some five years ago.  I replaced both the slave and master
cylinders (which was leaking).  This reduced the problem greatly, but
didn't fix it.  When engaging first or reverse there is grinding, but I
can first shift to second, then into gear and it will work, but is still
dragging.  There is no sound, so I don't think the pilot bearing is bad
and I doubt the throw out bearing is bad.  I've heard that oil on the
friction plate can cause sticking and I've noticed slipping when going
uphill.  Any ideas, suggestions, tests that I can do before pulling it
apart?  I like to be prepared!

Second, there is an intermittent miss that coincides with a pulling in of
paper when held near the exhaust pipe.  I think that means an open exhaust
valve.  Any other possibilities?  If so, what would cause this and what
can I do about it?  Will I need to have a valve job?  I'm going to pull
both the transmission and the engine when I work on the clutch, but would
prefer not to have to pull too much of the engine apart, since it was
rebuilt only about 3000 miles ago (see the history below).

History

255DH008181 was built in 9/82, then shipped to the Westfalia plant to be
converted to a camper.  My Dad bought it on 11/17/83.  He put about
120,000 miles on it before letting my brother use it for awhile.  On one
particularly fateful night, the oil light came on.  Thinking he could
&quot;make it,&quot; he pushed on.  The engine was overhauled, but from what I can
tell, the case wasn't split, which I don't understand.  The oil pump was
replaced, along with pistons, cylinders and the heads redone.  It was put
back into service, but only went about 3,000 more miles before the clutch
refused to disengage.  At that time, my Dad decided that he couldn't
afford to do much more with it, so he covered it with a tarp and let it
sit.

A bit less than two years ago, with my Dad thinking of retiring and moving
from Arkansas to Arizona, he asked if I would be interested in having it,
to which I thought about for 2.7 milliseconds and then said &quot;absolutely!&quot;
So every trip back (I live in New Mexico) would be spent working on it.  I
replaced the clutch cylinders, brake master cylinder, wheel cylinders.
The fuel tank was pulled and cleaned and fuel enriched with injector
cleaner was pumped through the fuel system, with the ignition disabled.
The oil was changed.  On a whim, we connected the ignition, cranked a
couple of times and it RAN!!!

Since then more things have been done and it's been brought by trailer out
to New Mexico, so it can dehydrate.  I hope to have the cash soon to pull
the engine and tranny replace the clutch and get it running and begin to
use it.  Except for extreme oxidation, which has come off nicely, and a
few rust spots the outside is in excellent shape.  The interior is also in
great shape, with just a few stains that I hope to clean up and some
problems with the pop-top canvas.

Looking at the VIN, it's obvious that I would own this Westy.  After all,
DH is my initials and 81 was the year I graduated from High School!

Thanks in advance for the help!

CUL,
