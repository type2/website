Hello All,
    A very good VW budy of mine really needs to get rid of this bus.
Otherwise it will just get thrown in his back field to rot or it will get
parted out.  He is located in Richmond, Ohio (Near Stubenville)  Please
contact him NOT me.  He can be reached at: volksnut_at_webtv_dot_net
    He's also having a VW Fellowship Picnic on Sat. May 13th.  Which no
doubt will be a lot of fun.  I hope to see some of you there...
See you down the road,
Aaron Badertscher

&gt;   Due to the fact my mother just purchased a karmann ghia that will be
&gt; coming out to my place for repairs, I am selling this bus. (no more room
&gt; at the inn!) This bus is a little hacked up and has rust in all the
&gt; normal spots. The bus has a custom 70's &quot;Shagen-Wagen&quot; interior kit that
&gt; includes; a fancy shag carpeted ply-wood fold out bed, a set of great
&gt; bass boat seats, and a furry beer cooler. The body mods on this bus are;
&gt; cut wheel-wells and missing the bulkhead behind the front seats. I have
&gt; wheel wells out of my parts bus I am willing to include if interested.
&gt; The bus is located in easteren Ohio and the price is $600 obo/trade (I
&gt; really need a westy interior) Pics. are on my web-page!
&gt;     I am also having a VW picnic at my home on saturday May 13 if anyone
&gt; is in the eastren Ohio area and would like to attend p-mail me for
&gt; directions.
