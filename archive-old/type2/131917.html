Folks,

I found after building a dozen or so type 4 motors over the last five years
that one thing that hardly anyone does is to really, really check the lift
at the valve,  make sure that the rocker stands are shimmed properly, and
the pushrods are the correct length.

The last couple motors i built i went to great lengths to maximize my lift,
even went to Porsche swivel head valve adjusting screws.  I did not come up
with these ideas myself, Jake Raby pointed me in this direction after i had
a motor on a westy that had head problems a few times in 5 years.

I found it to run smoother, have more power (seat of the pants not dyno...no
dyno around me) and run cooler (tested with CHT sensor and with infra red)

A lot of folks put in different cams and such but do not change the
pushrods, shim the rockers or anything.  It is not worth doing if that is
the case. I found that after doing all this, sometimes i got 1/3 more lift,
and my valve adjusting screw was pushing the valve straight, instead of
making contact at an angle...........I could only imagine, over time that
sideways pushing in a hot head over millions of reps would do to a valve
train..............or then maybe ei don;t have to imagine, it may have been
in my failures!
