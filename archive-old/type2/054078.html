Subject: Alternator Wire Questions

My old alternator is just not putting out the volts it should, so I
ordered a new one. My problem is that my bus is a '74, and it has a 55
amp alternator, and the alternator I ordered is for a (I think) '76 and
up. The old one has wires on it, but the new one just has a plug for
three wires and a screw for one wire (I think this is the one that goes
to the starter). I looked at my Bently wiring diagrams, but all of them
show an external voltage regulator (I bought my alternator from J-Bugs,
and they specificaly state that their alternators have BUILT IN
regulators). I know where my wires go from my old alternator, but I don't
know where they go from the new one. Anyone out there who can tell me? 
The one screw on the back of the new one has an &quot;8+&quot; or &quot;B+&quot; next to it,
and of the three prongs, the top left one has &quot;D+&quot; next to it, the middle
one on the bottom has &quot;D-&quot; next to it and the top right one has &quot;DF&quot; next
to it. Where do these go? Thanks in Advance.
