The site you are refering to might be

http://www.volks_dot_com.br
They even have what I beleive is a school bus version

Pretty neat

&gt; Tony,
&gt;  About a year ago I found a brazilian web site showing brand new baywindow
&gt; busses for a little over $15,000 US. They looked beautiful!  I've lost the
&gt; URL since then, but I would think if you do a search maybe you'd be able to
&gt; find it.
&gt;  Good luck
