Subject: question about my rebuild

I have a 2.0L engine that's just about done.  I was doing some reading 
on Richard Atwell's site and saw the bulletin about the shims that come 
with the Victor Reinz set.  I put the aluminum shims underneath the 
cylinders, however, I didn't put any sealer on them... are the cylinders 
going to start leaking oil there??

If it's a possibility that they would leak, I guess I could still pull 
everything off and put sealant on the cylinders... ugh, that would be a 
pain, though!

thanks,
Mike
