Subject: Re: [T2] Bus For Sale - Missoula, Montana

Billy,

At one time(in a galaxy far, far away....) Albuquerque was a hotbed of 
air cooled vw's.

Grab a phone book from their and look thru it.

Don't know if it still is, but I suspect it would be easier to take your 
bus than leave it.

Just my opinion....


Cheers, dave
