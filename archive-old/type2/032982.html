This is my first time to write, hope I am doing the right thing.

My wife and I purchased a 1970 camper bus.  I think there is a hole in the
#3 piston because there is 0 compression in the #3, the other pistons
compressions are fine and when hooking the air compressor at the sparkplug
renders air at oil cap.  I pulled the engine and have it in the garage
waiting for me to determine what is next.  This is my guess as to what
happened.  After driving for a month, I hit a curb that hit the tail pipe,
which made a hole in the exhaust.  Not knowing why the engine was running
ruff, I overcompensated by advancing the timing.  Then my wife has not
learned how to drive with love.  POW, we have a hole in the #3.

I have read lots of magazine articles and several book, and still do not
know what to do.  I thought that while I have the engine out that I might
add a few things to increase its performance and prolong its life.  I need a
book that says - if you have a 1970 buss, $300, and you are going to do the
work yourself, - this is what you should do.

Should I buy larger pistons and cylinders?  Which ones?  New high
performance exhaust system?  Which one?  Do I need to change anything else
if I do these things?  Will I get any increase in performance?  Is it worth
the money spent?  What would you do?

Thanks Amos and Heather Byington.
