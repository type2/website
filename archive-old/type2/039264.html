&gt; now to check it.  I found my fuel filler hose is screwed.  I know new ones

&gt; replacements?  Thanks.

    One day before my big trip to florida I ran all over western New York
looking for that little six inch piece of hose.  I finally came across a parts
store that could order it for me (really it's a three foot piece of hose with a
neoprene lining and steel reinforcement, and costs thirty dollars).  So I came
back at the designated time, and of course I was so excited I cut it as soon as
i got home, and when I matched up the old hose (always do that first **DOH**) I
jumped in the car and threw the thing on the counter.  They measured the old
hose wrong, and the warehouse was closed (they didn't want to take the cut hose
back, but I held my ground, and they refunded it) so they found me a piece of
radiator hose.  I put this on and smelled gas all the way to florida, especially
after filling up.  I haven't looked yet, to see if I just didn't tighten the
clamps enough, but I'm sure that the radiator hose is not the thing to have on
there.

    So try to find some neoprene lined hose.  Every place you go to that tells
you they don't have it will have a different suggestion as to where to get it.
Check out every lead you can.  And if worse comes to worse, and you can't find
anything near you, drop me a line and I'll get you the name and number of the
store I got mine from.

Happy trails, and don't smoke in your bus  (BOOM!!).
