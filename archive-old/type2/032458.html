Brendan,
Have you tried to adjust your clutch cable?  I have found that sometimes this cable will stretch or otherwise loosen up, causing hard shifting.  Follow the cable underneath from the pedal to the back of the bus where it connects to the little arm on the side of the transmission.  There should be a wing nut at the very end of the cable behind the little arm I just mentioned. This nut\arm release the clutch when the pedal is pushed and the cable is pulled. Tighten this nut a few turns (in essence to &quot;shorten&quot; the cable a bit) and try the clutch again.  If this doesn't help look at the linkage and then the clutch itself.
Peace, John Baker

When I start out in the morning second and third gear are tough to get into 
if I shift 4th, 3rd and then second that works better. Typically it seems to 
loosen up after a while and work better throughout the day.

Down shifting to first is almost always difficult, it feels like something 
is in the way and if I really force it, I can click past it and into 1st.

Also when I am sitting at a light and clutch to put it in first, if I don't 
pause after clutching and try to go to first I grind. If I give it 2 seconds 
between clutching and 1st no grinding. It seems that something is still 
spinning and needs time to stop spinning.

The clutch still has lots of life in it.

Are these two related and where do I go from here?

Thanks for all the past, present and future help,
Brendan
