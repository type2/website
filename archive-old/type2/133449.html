&gt; OKay every thing is hooked up out back. Had the family out to watch the

&gt; excitement is turning into frustration, I breathe. I check the power at the
&gt; battery. 13.86vlt. I connected my remote starter to the starter turns over
&gt; fine. I go back to the key. No power up front. No lights radio, which is not
&gt; connected to the key switch just a live wire to the fuse block.

try turning the key on and then using the rear starter and see if it
catches??  might help narrow down weather your searching for a power or
starter problem and weather it is front or back...


electrical problems, they take ten hours to find and ten minutes to fix

good luck
