&gt;Can't be done.  You must remove the starter (it's really not hard, 15
&gt;minutes tops).  However, you can't remove the solenoid from the starter
&gt;once you get it out unless you have an impact screwdriver.  Those screws
&gt;that hold the solenoid to the starter are very very tight.

Well, yes and kinda-sorta no.

Sean's right in that the starter has to be removed to remove the solenoid.
And it's not hard, just do what he said to do.  Removing the starter is a
no-brainer.

As for removing the solenoid from the starter, it *can* be done without an
impact screwdriver (ask me how I know), but do yourself a favour and get
one if you don't have one already.  The screws are really bejesus tight.

I didn't have two nickels to scrape together when I had to replace my
solenoid, so I used the biggest flat-head screwdriver that would fit the
slot in the screw, and pushed, tapped the screwdriver with a hammer, and
*cranked* it.  The screwdriver I used had a place to attach a wrench to it
to torque it.  I needed the help.  If your screwdrivers don't have a place
to slip a wrench on, a vise-grip might work, but will probably rip the hell
out of your screwdriver.

Aw heck, buy yourself a damn impact screwdriver!

(I got a re-built solenoid from Bow Wow Parts in Vancouver for about
CDN$30.00 {US$20.00} and it worked just fine)
