That's exactly the VDO temp sender I use.  It replaces the standard dipstick
and measures the oil temp in the &quot;middle of the pot&quot;.

Stan, 260 should be max, but you don't want to run there very long, 240 is
as high as you want to run for any time.

How do you know you are getting a good temperature reading?  I have a screw
in pressure gauge that goes where the oil pressure sensor screws into the
case, this gives me a very good reading on the pressure of an engine while
it is running either on a stand or in the bus.
