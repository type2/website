Robert posted this on the Vanagon list and I don't remember this topic
getting much discussion.

I'm assuming that Oxygenated fuel -- as they call it around here, is the
same as fuel with alcohol mixed with gasoline?

One other comment... Robert .. those temps sound really low for cylinder
head... they sound almost like Oil Temp!  What type of gauge and sender are
you using?

Another suggestion is It is time for gas companies to switch to alcohol
enriched fuel (: winter is coming...
I am in NC...

My head temps on my 73 2L T4 engine increases about 25 degrees during winter
with the change in fuel.  It drove me crazy the first time it did it about 3
years ago (I add a cylinder head temp gauge.  BTW my heads run _at_225 but now
with the alcohol 250 ). Checked every thing (Timing, main jets, plugs, etc.)
I got gas in a county that does not add alcohol and the temps returned to
normal.
