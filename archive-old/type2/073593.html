Subject: Friday musings (Harleys, VWs, and *Vespas!*)



You can can the Harleys AND the BMWs... what you need
is a Vespa or two!  I have a P125, GL, 50 Special, and
a couple Lambretta LD150s in the garage right now. 
The P125 is my daily rider and I have a nifty little
sidecar to restore this winter and bolt up in the
spring.

Vespas seem to be the one vehicle the Italians got
&quot;right.&quot;  They run forever, are cheap and REALLY easy
to rebuild, and (get this) RELIABLE!  That and they're
way too much fun to ride, and the chicks dig them. 
They attract a lot mroe attention than Harleys do,
too.  Put an expansion chamber exhaust on one and
watch folks turn their heads as you whiz by!  8^)

Just my $.02,

Chris
71 Bus w/Westie interior
90 Taurus SHO, some mods
a bunch of Vespas and a couple Lambrettas
