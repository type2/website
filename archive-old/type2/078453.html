&gt; &gt; &gt; I was replacing some fuel lines and reinstalling my fuel pump
yesterday.
&gt; &gt; &gt; I noticed that the metal line that is above the tranny is
&gt; &gt; &gt; rusted real bad. I was going to use a piece of brake line, but wanted
to
&gt; &gt; &gt; make sure that will be ok first. Do they sell metal fuel
&gt; &gt; &gt; line in lengths like brake line?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; My van has been sitting for a few years and I just started to work on it
&gt; &gt; again...
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; There's some rubber hose that been used for the fuel line (was interim
&gt; &gt; solution to shut off flow of gas so filter could be easily changed; I've
got
&gt; &gt; the rusty gas tank problem)
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Anyway, I just discovered that some of it is clogged with black goo.
Does
&gt; &gt; this sound like the remains of old gas/rust or has the gas reacted with
the
&gt; &gt; hose (black colored) and soldified?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I hope it's only the hose because that's easy to replace.  I'd hate to
have
&gt; &gt; to unclog the the line further because it's really tough stuff.  Has
anyone
&gt; &gt; else had this problem?
&gt; &gt;

Good idea/advice Bob,
BTW, the length of metal line that  was referred to earlier was from NAPA
with a United brake parts tag on it. ** part # 813-1225 1/4&quot; X 60&quot;** .  If
you use the metal line that your cutting and bending yourself, just remember
to clean out the openings with a small rattail file or equaviliant.  Be sure
to blow out *compressed air* the line well before installation..
