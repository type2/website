Subject: Re: [T2] the hubcap

Hi Jim,

Troy Wiccal and Dan Radom are planning to pick it up., possibly as  
soon as this weekend. How 'bout if  they give it to Mark at EveryBus  
and he passes it to you at Sevierville?  Where it goes thereafter is  
between you and the Hubcap.


Happy Trails,

Greg Potts

&gt; Greg -
&gt;
&gt; So, who is going to pickup the hubcap in Albuquerque?  I'm going  
&gt; thru there May 1st on my way east to Circle Yer Wagons, but since  
&gt; Mark Dearing won't be there to pick it up from me, I thought what  
&gt; the hell, just bring it back to California.  I could hand it off at  
&gt; the Sacramento Bug-O-Rama on Memorial Sunday *or* VW Classic in  
&gt; Irvine CA on June 10th *or* at the &quot;Motherlode&quot; show in Angels Camp  
&gt; CA on July 28th *or* Jerome Jamboree AZ in Sept.  Worst case  
&gt; scenario would be to hand off to a WetWestie at Buses By The Bridge  
&gt; next January, that way it could make the journey to the Pacific  
&gt; Northwest.
