 Not to rain on your parade, Tom and Dana, but AVP isn't faultless either.
&gt; They seem to think they can build just about everything. I have recently

Herr Doktor,

When I visited AVP I saw with my own eyes:

Rack after rack of VW parts. Heads, case halves, cranks, all organized. Not
organized with mythical German precision, but neatly stacked American style.

Parts for nothing else.

I certainly know nothing bout Mercruiser engines and I saw nothing there to
lead me to suspect that they knew anything about them either. They appearded
to be VW specialists to me.

&gt;From their website:

Exclusively VW Parts and Engine and Machine Services
Specializing in T-2, bus, and vanagons.
Sacramento, California location since 1984

Is it possible that there is another AVP building marine engines?

Respectfully,
