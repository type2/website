Hi Dan,

Where do you guys get the new seals?  I've got a 1980
Westfalia with a rusted sliding door window.  I know
some have said South American seals are good, but I
doubt if they make any for 80 to 92 Vanagons.  I'm
assuming you expert window removers would frown on
se-sealing the old rubber with some black RTV.

Rob
