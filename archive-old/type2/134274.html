Subject: Re: [T2] Factory / Dealer Fog Lamps

Actually...I believe the fog lamps were on the top of the bumper. Here is a 
page from the 77 dealer brochure, which shows them on the top, and I imagine 
they were similar for the 73:

Good luck with it!!

&gt; I swapped it upside down so that the holes are facing the underside of the 
&gt; bumper.
&gt; Do you guys have any pictures of what the factory fog lamps looked like? 
&gt; Were they round or rectangular during the 73 model year?
