  (LONG)

&gt;&gt;The AFM line above is why a lot of us want to go to megasquirt...
&gt;&gt;#1, it is &quot;supposed&quot; to be a restriction in the air intake and #2,
&gt;&gt;I've &quot;heard&quot; that at about 4,000 rpm, the vane is on the max limit....so
&gt;&gt;you really don't get a longer duration of squirt, but you do get more of
&gt;&gt;them because the ecu is also watching the rpm's as well.

 &gt;Aren't there theoretical limits to engine power anyway? What kind of
 &gt;improvement are you expecting?

The reason for megasquirt is complete tunability.  You want more/less 
fuel at different points of your torque curve at different loads, just 
do it.  Want to tune for economy, do it.  You have complete control of 
every aspect of your fuel curve where the L-jet gave a good shot at 
it... probably slightly better with later models that had an o2 sensor. 
  Is the L-Jet bad, no, not really, it's that there's better, and the 
better stuff (megasquirt) is now price accessible.

Now, the funny thing is that I haven't even removed my AFM yet.  I just 
left it in-line just in case I ever need to switch back (which I did 
need to do in the beginning).  Is it a hiderance to the air-flow, I 
dunno.  However, I do know that my engine has really sprung to life, 
even with that AFM &quot;restriction&quot;.  I have so much more power where I 
never really knew I had it.  I can only imagine how much better it will 
be without it.. (not really holding my breath, though ;)

The other reason I haven't pulled off the AFM is I'm too busy working on 
the new engine to fabricate a new air filter assembly.  Plus, when when 
I finally don't have to deal with smog, I'll remove the stock EFI 
completely.
