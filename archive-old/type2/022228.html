&gt;Yeah, it's a mystery to me how they are still in business. But, just a few  
&gt;years ago they'd be screwing us all and we would'nt have known how wide 
&gt;spread the problem was. Thanks to the Internet, the word is out on these 
&gt;folks, and many more just like them!      Jeff S.

I suspect that they stay in business by churning out a few decent engines
along with the bad ones. The PO of the bus I just wrecked (more in a
separate post) put in a GEX, and I was more than happy with it once the bus
was mine.

That doesn't mean you're likely to get a good one from them. But their
failure rate is somewhere below 100%.

As always, YMMV.
