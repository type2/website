Subject: Steering wheel cover

We have a leather Wheelskin on our bus and love it. It's a
bit of a pain to install. I think we got size B, but check
that with the seller. We added a layer of thin styro packing
material to get the fit just right and then laced it up,
which is hard on the fingers. But when it's done, the
steering wheel is so smooth and nice, and doesn't feel cold
in the mornings. It also still looks and feels more or less
like a bus steering wheel, which won't suit you if you're
after the overstuffed look and feel. 

http://www.wheelskins_dot_com has the info.

We got ours through
http://autotoystore_dot_com/wheelskins.html

Fellow there was very helpful. Sent supplementary
instructions on installation.
