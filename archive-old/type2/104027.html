Subject: Dash

Hi

I reciently bought a '79 bus and have started the
process to restore it.  Until I get an engine
installed I'm getting it ready for painting by taking
off everything that doesn't move and setting traps for
what does.  Once question I have is does anyone know
of a place where I can purchase a dashboard.  I have
check some of the larger sites catalogue but found
nothing.  Any help is appreciated.

Tks
