I've recently had the idea to connect the
on/off power wire to the ignition buzzer circuit.
I noticed in my Golf that the radio is switchable by just having the key
in the ignition. This way you don't burn up your coil with the ignition
switch on (if you have points) or have to turn the radio on and off
whenever you get in or out of the car (bus).
Has anyone done this?  

Greg,

this is exactly how I wired in the stereo on my '81 Vanagon.  It works well
this way.
