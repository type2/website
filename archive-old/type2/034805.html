Subject: possible gunk in the fuel tank

Dear friends, 

This past fall one of our '79 busses was vandalized while sitting out in our
company parking lot.  Rear windshield smashed, front one cracked, tire
slashed etc. etc.  While all of this damage is painful, it is obvious and
can be fixed.  After we pushed the vehicle indoors to evaluate, I realized
the gas tank cap was missing.  Being that our parking lot is not paved but
stone, I have a concern that something (stones) could have been shoved down
into the tank.

Is there any good way to check for foreign substances in the tank?  Thanks
for your help!
