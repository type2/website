&gt; I happened to be looking in Hot VWs, Nov. 99 issue and saw an ad on page 102
&gt; for Roger's European Engineering in Downey, Calif. He is offering 1.7, 1.8,
&gt; 2.0 remanufactured heads for $95 exchange. Anybody know anything about them??
&gt; For
&gt; that price they are either bare or come with non-sodium filled exhaust
&gt; valves?

As far as Roger goes, I can speak a little bit.  I have been in his shop and
from the looks of it, he is very busy.  Pleasant guy to do business with.  The
work I had done was to have them  press old ball joints out and new in on my
torsion arms that I hand carried into his shop.  I cannot report about his reman
heads.
