Plugs wet with fuel is either low spark or no spark or over fueling. I'd  
check spark. Then atleast clean your filter out. A $4 dollar filter is cheaper  
than a $100 pump. 70% of the time on fuel injection I find that when the basic  
tune up stuff is right it cures or atleast improves the problems. I  have too 
many times gone into stuff assuming worst case and ended up back  at the 
basics and solved the problem. I think they call it putting the carriage  before 
the horse. Air filter, fuel filter, you know the deal. I'm not saying it  will 
solve your problem but, start with the basics and work your way from there.  
Hope this helps. Good luck.
