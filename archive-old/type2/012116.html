To: type2_at_type2_dot_com

Stuff to try:

1. Vise grips and a hammer - a lousy method, but
occasionally necessary

2. Cut a slot in the top of the bolt, and try using a
big screwdriver.

3. Take your chances with a torch and paraffin wax,
and then use vise grips and a hammer. 

4. Use a die grinder to grind the heads off the bolts,
and worry about how you're going to get the rest of
the bolt out later.

5. Panic.

&gt; Help!
&gt; I'm trying to get my tranny down from my 73 Bus
&gt; (manual) before the snow
&gt; flies and am stuck by the rear mounting bolts not
&gt; coming out and becoming
&gt; stripped.
&gt; Any tricks to getting those 2 nuts off if they are
&gt; stripping?  I put some
&gt; penetrating oil on them and will let them soak
&gt; overnight.  But now that the
&gt; 17mm socket does not grip on, I'm not sure how to
&gt; get them off (use a
&gt; slightly smaller size socket, maybe SAE? chisel them
&gt; off?).  I'm leery to
&gt; use a torch to heat them up because of proximity of
&gt; fuel tank and lines.
&gt; Any advice would be greatly appreciated as these are
&gt; the last 2 bolts
&gt; required to take the tranny out.
&gt; Thanks.
