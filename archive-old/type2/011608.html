Porsche 914's came with rev-limiting rotors in them.  I bounce mine all the 
time in my 914 in 1st and 2nd and occasionally in 3rd - my bus doesn't seem to 
need one :(.  Cuts out at 5500 RPM.  Will work on all type IV powered buses.  
Part number 022-905-225A - available at www.pelicanparts_dot_com for $20.60.

Mike Dwyer quoted part number 1 234 332 192 with a limit of 4500 RPM.  Is this 
for a type 1 dist or a type IV (or does it make a difference)?
