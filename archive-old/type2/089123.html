Subject: Re: [T2] Oil Everywhere!!!!

Hey Courtney
if after checking that the cable and nut are alright, the other major
possibility is the throwout arm has broken or clutch springs are broken,
both mean a motor pull. How much oil is over everything? Soaked? or looks
like build up over time?
Need a hand?
