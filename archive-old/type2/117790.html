Subject: Re: [T2] door rubber really tight

Meg,

Yes, it will relax over time.  Mine are still pretty tight to
close, but it is also a funtion of the air tightness of the rest of the 
bus.

I can hardly get mine closed with all the windows closed and with the
sliding door glass open about 5&quot;, it will blow a *lot* of air at you
when you close the door.

Otherwise, just some time!

Chers, dave

&gt; Hi,
&gt; 
&gt; We put in new door seals (German ones from Bus Depot because they were
&gt; suppose to be the best fit) the door is soooo tight. It closed and when
&gt; you open it, it pops open. I was looking for advice if this is a problem
&gt; or will the rubber relax (lack of better description) with age. Have
&gt; others had this problem and there solutions?
