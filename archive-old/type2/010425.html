The clutch release bearing was a new German Sachs
bearing when I installed it last week.

Also , I backed off the clutch cable til I have almost
3&quot; ( yes, three inches) of freeplay at the pedal and
it still growls. :-(  Could be the bearing is now
ruined.
Thanks for the help so far -- keep it coming.
