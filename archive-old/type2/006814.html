Subject: Any one need some camper interior?
To: type2_at_type2_dot_com

Hey everyone!  I just bought a Westfalia Camper interior from a 1969 Poptop.  
I only needed the cushons so I can redo mine.  I have the Icebox unit too.  
The strange thing is that the unit has a sink pump but no sink.  Instead the 
icebox is the whole unit, but it does have the holding tank behind it. And 
above the ice box there is a two inch tall pull out cabinet.  I have never 
seen this set up before on this model.   Was having no sink a option?  It's 
factory on this one.  I also have the long cabinets and the folding bed.  If 
any one in northern ohio needs any of these things email me.  Like I said I 
only needed the gold vinyl to cover my interior.  Hopefully someone can use 
it.  If not it will make cool furniture for my house!
