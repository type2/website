The Exhaust Gas Recirculation system is a smog control that feeds
uncombustible exhaust into the cylinders resulting in lowering combustion
temperature thereby decreasing nitrous oxide emissions.

&gt; This will wound like a silly question to most of you, but what is EGR?
&gt; Is it to do with US smog control or something?
&gt;
&gt; I noticed my bay (recent import form Cal.) came with a strange air(?) box,
&gt; fitted into the engine bay, (above the battery), that had a feed from the
&gt; fan housing and an outlet.
&gt; There's also some form of large blower under the front belly pan.
&gt; Is this anything specific to US vehicles?
