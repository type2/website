Subject: troubleshooter for overheating (was: cooling system for 78 Westy)

Volks,
Motivated by the recent thread (and the low opportunity cost of post-lunch
slump), I decided to re-edit the &quot;overheating&quot; text I wrote a few years ago
and which can also be found in the library. The updated version is now at
http://www.simplecom_dot_net/dakhlia/bus-stuff/overheating.html
Feel free to point out errors or to add your own two cents. Thanks,
Sami
