Subject:  Re: [T2] What types of seats do you have up front?

i believe this question came up a couple months
ago and one of the other listees mentioned that seats
out of the 80's toyota vans i believe were a good fit
and very comfortable.  from what i can remember the
sliding tracks for the seat unbolt from the van making
it an easy switch into your bus.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Anything has got to be more comfortable than the
