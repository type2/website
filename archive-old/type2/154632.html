Subject: Taco plate with cover - install question

I'm about ready to install my newly acquired taco plate and cover and have a
question.

 

When I purchased it, it came with a large &quot;O&quot; ring and two paper gaskets.
It appears that the large &quot;O&quot; ring goes on the Taco plate as the seal
between it and the case, then the paper gasket and lastly the cover.  So,
why two paper gaskets?  Did the seller give me one extra or am I missing
something.

 

It also appears that they all get attached at the same time with the pair of
screws that currently hold the original plate in place.

 

Your input is appreciated.
