Subject: URGENT AIRS T2 -  minor? breakdown in Toutle Creek Washington - m

Got an AIRS call this morning.  Jerry Seman and his family from Vancouver,
BC Canada.

SITUATION:
Jerry has a 1975 Westy -- converted to carb -- owner is NOT MECHANICAL.  He
has driven a 3000 mile trip, bus ran fine.  Last night pulled over at:

    Toutle Creek Rest Area -- 55 miles north of Oregon / Washington state
line.

He slept for the night woke up to pull away and AS HE WAS BACKING OUT,
another driver indicates that he is leaking pool of oil.  He shut the engine
down right away.  He has AAA and can get it towed up to 100 miles... but
doesn't have a lot of $ to spend on garage repair.  He does have time, said
it would be OK if he was stuck there for 24 hours...

From what he is saying, it isn't serious YET -- but he isn't skilled enough
to track down the cause.  It sounds like it could be something as simple as
the drain plug or valve covers leaking..

I WILL BE TALKING MORE TO HIM.  If you want his number, call me -- Stephen
at (425) 235-9168.  Or email me, I'll be checking email.
