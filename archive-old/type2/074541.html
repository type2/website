&gt;Hey,
&gt;
&gt;I have my eye on a 1978 Westy. Auto Trans,
&gt;124,000 miles, a bit of surface rust and a 
&gt;couple of small holes in the fiberglass camper 
&gt;top that look like they can be patched.
&gt;
&gt;I can pick it up for $1,200. It sounds like a
&gt;deal to me...

I say anyone who's willing to care for another one of these and keep it on the road ought to go for it. I hear much more ridiulous prices than that asked, and a rebuild doens't have to cost 2000 bucks if you're willing to get dirty.


&gt;PS, it already has Greatful Dead stickers in 
&gt;the windows and a &quot;Heyduke Lives&quot; bumper 
&gt;sticker. So I have that goin for me...which is nice.


I say two thumbs up on the dead stickers (unless they're those dumb bears!) and nice caddyshack reference.
