Hi Andrew,
   You said &quot;I can drive the bus around
town all day with no problems; however, after three miles on the
highway, it starts to stall&quot;

   I had this same exact problem this past April with our 71 westy with a 
1600 dual port engine.  I was on my way to Everybus 2000 in NC and it 
started happening in PA.  Since it ran fine at slow speeds I turned around 
and limped home.
   As it turned out, there is a fuel filter screwed into the bottom of the 
gas tank, and after so many years, it was clogged up.  First drain the fuel 
tank.  Remove your fuel hose and catch the gas that comes out.  Then screw 
out the filter, it's the hex at the tank outlet.  A new filter and a couple 
of seals is only a few dollars from any of the usual parts sources.  Now if 
you really want to do the job right, take the tank out and flush and seal 
it.  I didn't have the opportunity so I just flushed the tank out with about 
5 gallons of alcohol.  I kept catching the alcohol and running it through 
the tank again and again, catching it in a bucket as it came out and 
straining it before pouring it back in.  Then I installed the new filter and 
seals.  This is a great time to replace all your fuel line hoses too!
   I'm pretty sure you will find this to be your problem, and it's an easy 
one to fix.
