Subject: I told 'em so.....

I worked at a VW-Audi dealership back in the late 60's, and one summer day
the owner handed me a car to test as 'maybe the replacement for the
beetle.' As I recall, it was black and small, about the size of a beetle,
boxy, conventional-looking, with a hood and trunk, like a Fiat only rear
engined. Maybe like a squared-off Renault Dauphine of that era. All I was
asked to do was drive the car for a day and report my impressions. At the
time, I was driving a 62 beetle.

The mule was an OK car and I said so, noting that it was just another
square econo-box, and adding the remark that I didn't know why VW was
considering changing the most successful and popular design in history.

Never heard anything more about it. The test mule was only at the
dealership for about a week, other people drove it and reported their
opinions, then it went back to limbo in VW of America land.

And there you have it, for whatever it is worth. Doesn't seem to illuminate
much at all, in my opinion.   But I was right, and they didn't listen to me!

Then, in the 70's the Rabbit appeared, followed by the Jetta and the Golf,
and finally the Passat and Corrodo.  Now, retro-enter the New Beetle, 30
years later. I told 'em so. Maybe somebody found my report.

&gt;It's only money, ...snip.......... The gvw manager who tried to do this to
&gt;the bug in 1970 got fired, somebody else please tell the story right, I don't
&gt;have all the details, but I hear he wanted to use the mid-engine 914 platform
&gt;to build a successor to the beetle as the basic vw sedan model and it was
&gt;such a mess they canned the whole administration, this was just after audi
&gt;started to screw up the old engineering designs already.  I'm thinking this
&gt;was not the 411 model, it was mid engine and a beetle-type low cost car.
&gt;Anybody ever see these designs?
