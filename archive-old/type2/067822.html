Subject: Stat Update: Minus one Zorm Truck!

Hi All,

Earlier this week I drove my former 58 Euro Single Cab Pickup to his new
home. He now is in the capable hands of a good friend and fellow VVWCA 
'Gang of Three' Co-Editor, Steve Carr.  He made a partial trade of his 66 
wrecked &amp; neglected daily driver Bug for Zorm.  A while back he also ended 
up with my old 54 Single Cab.  Anyhow, I'll now turn my attentions to my
other Splitties, Bus-trucks, Vanagons and Bugs.  I'm still at that unlucky
number of 13 VW's though!  BTW, Steve *really* wanted Zorm, the primarily
reason for Zorm jumping ship.  We seem to do a lot of trading.  8-)
