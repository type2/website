Subject: [T2] Clutch Cable Replacement

Hi Volks,

I don't ask for help too often for The Mothership but this morning my clutch
cable broke.  I have never had to replace this part and need the wisdom of
the list in doing so.

If there are any tricks and tips you can offer please e mail me with them.

My local parts store is having one shipped in, so it should be here in the
morning.  

Thanks in advance,

Charlie Ford
