I heard of a guy that used Draino. I'm not making this up! He claimed
it worked, but I'm afraid of the stuff. I took my sunroof off and made
a cover from quarter inch plywood and painted it attached it in a way
where I wouldn't have to drill or modify the roof. Undoing four wingnut
takes it off. No more geting drenched while sleeping on a rainy night!
Maybe some day I'll be able to afford to fixit right. My cables and
gears are shot, too.
