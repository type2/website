Subject: Sit table. Stay!

I'm curious -

I have the table that hinges from the top on the driver's side. I don't
believe I've ever noticed a method of securing the bottom (during
transport), so that the table doesn't swing out during those 1.5G left hand
turns.

What's that all about? Am I missing something really obvious? Other than the
fact that I'm getting old and achy? Oh, and that my nosehairs are starting
to tickle my upper lip?

Any and all advice will be greatly appreciated.

Humbly,
