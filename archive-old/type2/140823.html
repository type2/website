Subject: Why retrofit a smaller oil pump

Hi all,
Unfortunately all my spares are not with me currently to measure and confirm,
but I remember when re-building my type 4 motor ('77 kombi) the gears were
only 24mm originally. I also know all the type 1 motors I've had apart
(1600TP, beetle and type 3) the gears were smaller than the type 4 motor.
So can anyone confirm if 26mm definitely is original? From my experience 21mm
sounds more like original.

None of my manuals state the gear width either unfortunately.

Cheers,
Richard,
Brisbane Australia.


&gt;Hi dear list,
I found a flat camshaft and an oil pump with 21mm gears in the AE
(seems original) case of my dual port type 1 engine - that is for a
1971 bus.
