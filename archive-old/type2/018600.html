Hey,
        While rebuilding the 2.0 L for my '78 Westy, I noticed that on
the driver's side, there was a piece of tin curving around under the
cylinders while on the opposite side it did not. I went to the dealer
(ugh) and after looking at their microfiche, there was indeed supposed
to be some tinware on that side also. So I'd like to know if the p.o.
removed any other important tin pieces I should know about. Does anyone
have or know where to find a diagram of all the tin that's supposed to
be on a '78? I think Bentley only shows it for earlier models. Thanks.

Gordon
