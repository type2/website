&gt;i'm just wondering i am probabley the most inexperienced in mechanics and 
&gt;cars on the list and here to learn as much as i can(just to let you know 
&gt;before you tell yourself how stupid this question is).
&gt;Is it possible to lower your bus about 2&quot; in the front by simply putting 
&gt;smaller shocks on? i own a 72 westy.

No, it won't work.  Shocks will not change the ride height significantly,
unless they are coilovers, in which case they will raise the height, not
lower it.
