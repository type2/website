Nothing to fight about.Late 73's and all 74's used sodium-cooled exhaust
valves. The stems of the valves are tubular and sodium metal is poured
into them. Then the opening is welded shut. Because sodium is a liquid
(I believe) at operating temps, the heat transfer is much better to the
guide.This was a fix to stop the heads breaking off the exhaust valves
as eventually happened to ALL 72's and early 73's. Sodium-cooled exhaust
valves are used in most truck motors, nearly all Porsches, and other
high performance applications, especially where the exhaust valves spend
more time open and less time closed (high duration cams).
.008 is the correct lash for both LATE 73's and All 74's
Go with it. .008 wouldn't hurt even if the sodium-cooled valves were not
present.
