&gt;
&gt; It's actually not a bad idea.  Water dissolved in air is called &quot;humidity&quot;
&gt; and is experienced every day but buses in humid environments.  You could
&gt; put a mist sprayer on the inlet of the fan and lower the air temperature
&gt; twenty degrees in desert environment without ever having liquid water
&gt; touch the engine.
&gt;
&gt; However, it would use a lot of water, as the fan pulls a lot of air.  A
&gt; westy water tank might support such a system for a half-hour or so!

Drive in the rain,  !!!
