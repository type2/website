&gt; You set toe for both sides at the same time.  You measure it with two
&gt; yardsticks between the rims ahead of the spindle and behind the
&gt; spindle. the difference in the two readings is the toe-in.  To get it
&gt; right, you need to roll the bus to a stop without using the brakes,
&gt; then chock the rear wheels while you make your measurements.

George, I fear I have to disagree with you here.  As another poster has
said, it is possible to set the two wheels correctly to each other, but
not straight ahead.  I think it important to set them to the centerline of
the bus.  I should have been more explicit.  Rolling to a stop on level
ground, without touching the brakes or steering wheel will *usually* mean
that the wheels are neutrally located, but if the alignment is far enough
off, they may not.

&gt; &gt; pop the drag link out of the pitman arm (comes off the steering box),
&gt; &gt; center the steering box,
&gt; &gt; level the steering wheel,
&gt; &gt; adjust the length of the drag link, and finally 
&gt; &gt; reconnct the drag link to the pitman arm.
&gt; 
&gt; Or, if you have a steering wheel puller
&gt; you can simply remove and reposition the steering wheel.  I don't have the
&gt; puller, and if I adjust the drag link to get the steering wheel centered,
&gt; the steering box gets to the end of its worm before the wheel reaches its
&gt; stop.  For some reason, my wheel is way off and that's one of the things I
&gt; haven't fixed yet, lacking a puller.

George, I forgot the step about undoing the PO's efforts...  It is very
important that the steering box be centered.  Again, I should have been
more explicit :-( 

More explicit step:

After you set the toe, with the drag link disconnected, you should turn
the steering wheel back and forth until the steering box is in the center
of it range of motion.  The steering wheel *should* be level and upright
at that point, but it may not be.  Now is the time to re-level it if need
be (see below). When you have the wheel off, make sure that the cancelling
ring for the turn signals is in the right orientation.  I have had buses
where the ring/wheel was installed 180 degrees out. With the steering box
centered and after the wheel has been set level, adjust the length of the
drag link to reach the pitman arm and fasten it in place.

Note that if your wheel is not level, you can relevel it at any time,
*BUT* the way to do it is to set the steering box to neutral and level the
wheel.  Please do not randomly level it to cover up a misaligned front
end!  If the steering box is centered and the wheel is level, but the car
steers funny, then your front end is out of alignment!

Removing/replacing the steering wheel:  
There is a divide between early and late steering columns.  I *think* the
change occurred in ?74?  If you have the early column, the splines have a
slight taper to them and the wheel will need to be pulled/popped off.  If
you have the late column, the wheel should lift off.

&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Once you have the toe set, you are ready to set the camber :-)
&gt; 
&gt; Well, I set the camber first, but check it after I do the toe.

Probably you are correct.  I used to have access to an alignment jig many
years ago, and we set toe first, then set camber, then checked toe, but as
long as both are correct at the end of the experience, your bus will be
happy.  You would think that like timing and dwell, the correct order
would be vital, but my experience is that resetting the camber does not
affect to much at all.  OTOH, I never remember having to change the camber
very much at all.

&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Look at your ball joints.  One of them will have a huge hex under it.
&gt; 
&gt; That would be the top one.  The hex is between the trailing arm and the
&gt; spindle.

Check!  I was/am at work w/o the Bentley and could not remember which it
was.

&gt;   Pop
&gt; &gt; that ball joint loose from its trailing arm.
&gt; 
&gt; I just loosen the nut a quarter turn or so.  As soon as I turn the hex it
&gt; frees up nicely.

Some will, some won't :-)  After 20+ years in place, some are a metric
bear to get loose.  (A metric bear is 2.2x as mean as an english bear :-)

&gt; &gt; *If* the cam comes with the
&gt; &gt; ball joint (it usually does), then rotate that with a basin wrench until
&gt; &gt; your caster is correct.
&gt; 
&gt; You can check the camber with a camber guage, or with a homemade camber
&gt; wedge and a level.  The bus must be on a level surface, evenly loaded.
&gt; Make sure that the notch in the middle of one of the adjusting hex faces
&gt; is pointing somewhere near forward.  If it points backward, it will screw
&gt; up your caster, which is non-adjustable.

Excellent point!  We always were able to correct the minor problems we
found by cranking the cam little tiny movements, but I can see having real
problems if you screw this up :-)

&gt; &gt; Scott Fraser gave thes specs for a 1971 in a post back a bit:
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt;From page 2-35 of the Bentley book

&gt; &gt; Total toe with wheels not pressed: +15' +- 15' or 0.0 to 3.3mm (0 to 1/8
&gt; &gt; in)
&gt; &gt; Total toe with wheels pressed: +5' +- 15'
&gt; &gt; Pressure applied to wheels: 15 +- 3 kg (33 +- 6lb)
&gt; &gt; Maximum permissible difference between tow with wheels pressed and not
&gt; &gt; pressed: 25'

The way I have always interpreted these figures is that I want the front
of each wheel to be in between 0 and 1/16&quot; *from the centerline of the
bus*.  Allocate half of the toe to each wheel.  The way I did that was to
set the left front wheel to 1/32&quot; in (actually, we went for a hair less,
but once you get to 64ths and 128ths of an inch, you stop calling out for
precision and going &quot;a hair more in/out&quot; :-) then adjust the tie rod on
the right front side to a total toe in of 1/16&quot;.

&gt; &gt; Final thought:  You really cannot do this correctly without the alignment
&gt; &gt; machine!
&gt; 
&gt; I do a good job without the machine.  Of course, I also find teaching
&gt; kinematics and dynamics to be fun!  :)  If you are careful and find a nice
&gt; level

I didn't respond on this before, and I am not going to go on at length
now, but I am sticking to my opinion.  If I still had access to the jig,
I'd do it. Since I don't, I don't.
