Subject: Re: [T2] fan shim, muffler q's and 1st engine drop

You might want to check your local muffler shop. I changed the muffler on my
wife's F**d with one I got from an independently owned muffler shop. Good
quality stainless steel. Out if interest I asked if they could get me one for
my 75 bus. He showed me one on his shelf, same stainless steel as the one I
just bought. $65.00. Didn't need it at the time but if I ever do I know where
to go. still no rust on my wife's muffler. The shop would not tell me who
their supplier was or the brand, oh well. I guess he has to protect his
profits.

  Also, Hal had a quiet-pack muffler where I have a glasspack (yuck). His
  engine was noticably quieter, so now I want his muffler :) In searching
  the 'net, the prices vary pretty widely, but everyone seems to say
  these rust out in 2 years regardless of which one you buy. Is that
  really true? Is a bugpack muffler going to rust to dust as quickly as
  an EMPI? Is either one better than the other or worth the extra price?
