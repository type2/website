Subject: shift problem

I have a 70 bus. Its hard to get into 1st gear,alittle hard to get into2nd.
3rd and 4th go in real smooth. It don't scrape or grind gears its just hard
to push in. Has a new clutch,pressure plate,T.O. bearing,clutch fork and
clutch cable. Clutch is adjusted right. Could it be a shift coupler and if it
is, how hard is it to change? Also could it be the trans.?  thanks
