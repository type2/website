Hi All, Greg, 

The bus is a '77, 2.0L FI.  The PO added a mild cam, and it's got a fair
bit of grunt.  She'll cruise happily at 70-75mph all day long, and has
no trouble at all hitting 80 for passing (funny to see the look on their
faces). 

Checking around a lot further, I think my best bet will be to contact
Vintage air and get their input on putting together a system.  There's
no shortage of room in the bus, it's just that there's a whole lotta bus
to cool down.   

I do know that the late-model Nip compressors use many small cylinders
to compress the refridgerant, and presents less of a load on the motor
than the older twin cylinder compressors.  

Personally, I can live just fine without A/C.  None of the vehicles I've
ever owned had AC, except for the wife's Mini Cooper.  But for the sake
of my wife, and our 3 big empty-headed dogs, I'd like to able to cool
the bus down a bit when need be.  



&gt; One thing we haven't heard from Shad is what year bus he has.  
&gt; Throwing that load at a stock early bay engine might be a wee bit  
&gt; optimistic.
