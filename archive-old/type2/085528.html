Subject: On the road (finally!)


I'm happy to report that after months of perseverance I'm finally a menace
to the road!

If anyone remembers I drove my VW from Victoria, BC Canada to Austin, TX
four years ago and ran into a snafu registering my vehicle when VWOA gave me
the wrong letter stating that my vehicle did not meet EPA emissions
(basically slow death by thousands of $$$ with no guarantees from a
registered importer).

I fought VWOA over the letter (to match the EPA labels on the bus) but after
I got the correct letter the bus ended up sitting for 3 1/2 years and the
long time rusted out gas tank has turned to sludge in the Texas heat.

So, back in Feb I pulled the tank and engine with the help of a friend and
proceeded to clean the tank, replace fuel lines and sender, filler neck,
engine bay seal, roadworthy-ness, etc. etc. etc.

Many orders to Bus Depot later, I finally cleared all red tape and made my
first trip to the gas station after:

- Scouring boneyards to change face of speedo to MPH and label odo KM
- Get Insurance using only VIN (no collision those #_at_%*$!)
- Have modifications inspected by factory authorized VW dealer
- HS-7 clearance from US Customs
- Hunt down missing EGR parts
- Safety and emissions inspection
- Get police department clearance (looking for stolen VINs)
- Transfer title and register for plates

After all this, cleaning out gas tanks was really fun by comparison.  Anyone
considering bringing a Canadian vehicle down to the US can email me anytime
for advice/details.  Your luck will totally depend on the year of your VW.
Unless you paid $16,000 ;-) for your Westy, it maybe better to leave it at
home and purchase a US model here.

Next adventure: California emissions...
