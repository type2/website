&gt; You definitely need these. Without them the head/cylinder will definitely

there seems to be some disagreement about this, me, I've always used em.

&gt; leak, with old ones they will probably leak, with new ones they won't leak
&gt; provided your head and cylinder are healthy.
&gt; Bow Wow parts in Victoria BC is where I,ve always bought them.
&gt; Maybe posting an update on what you have tried/found so far would help the
&gt; list help you.

would be a lot easier to post what I haven't tried.

&gt; Sounds like the head may have been loose, causing the leak.

nuts were still to spec, I have a torque wrench and use it as per Bentley

&gt; How did you find the leak? Compression test?

&gt; &gt;     I have been having the problem with the 2liter engine in my 78 auto
&gt; &gt; tranny, someone suggested a leaky head so last week I swapped out a head.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; today I took some time to look it over real good....only thing I could
&gt; &gt; really find was some material missing beside the head seat on #4 but no
&gt; &gt; hole, in #3 which is where the leak was.....there was some evidence of
&gt; &gt; leakage from the cyl... sort of a blackened area fanning out from a spot
&gt; &gt; on the head/cyl interface...no damage noticable on the head, didn't see
&gt; &gt; any on the Cyl or piston when swapping.
&gt; &gt;   looking real real close it appeared that the thin metal gasket between
&gt; &gt; the cyl and head may have been leaking.
&gt; &gt; .  is this gasket needed
&gt; &gt; .  where can I get em
&gt; &gt; .  don't you change the compression ratio if you remove em.
&gt; &gt; .  what about if you have em on one side but you remove em from the other
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; all I have are used ones and they are getting old..?????
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; O great and wise list....inspiration and guidance needed here
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; thanks
&gt; &gt; Bob
