Subject: Re: 1st oil chg.

Hello,
Below is what I've used in the past:
Framm PH8A
Fram HP1
Motocraft FL1A
AC PF2
Mobil 1 M1-301
and the K&amp;N HP3001.
I've used all the above on my 72 bus. Should work on all 72-79s. I use the 
K&amp;N.  It's abit pricy.  I stock up when it's on sale.  I like the bottom nut on 
it has on it's case.  This makes it easy to get on and off. Hope this helps.
