Subject: EEC Charcoal Can Question / Pics Up

Does anyone have a good picture of the entire charcoal
cannister from late bus? I'm trying to figure out
where the hoses connect for my latest photo
postings... I see the large hose at the top and
somehow the gas tank vent attaches (?) Where is the
other large hose (that goes to the engine tin) - on
the bottom?

I looked at Richard Atwell's photos and couldn't see
it there, either. BTW - Every time I look at his
photos I start to drool! What an excellent
documentary! Many of my photos were taken with a
camcorder, captured and tweaked. His are all just
perfect and soooo clean!

Anyhoo, help on the EEC system, please.

The rest of the pics are up. -BaH
