Subject: Re: [T2] Re: Oil Strainer?

Hello All    You have to be really careful tighting the bolt for the screen 
on the type 4 motor, it can break the case where the oil pick-up tube bolts 
to it. I personally only do it about once a year cause of this problem and 
the fact that this motor has a filter. Later and have fun  Mark Dearing
