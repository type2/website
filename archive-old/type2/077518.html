Subject: Re: [T2] Help identifying P&amp;C set

&gt;96mm is standard I think for a 914.

Uh, I don't think this is correct.  914 engines came in the same 
sizes as bus engines, and used the same size (90, 93, and 94mm) 
pistons.

Your compression ratio may change depending on whether the pistons 
are flat topped or dished.  My guess is that they are flat 
topped.  Be sure and calculate your compression ratio using these 
pistons and make sure you are happy with it.  I wouldn't go over 
7.5 to 1.  You will probably have to get spacers to go under the 
cylinders.  You may also have to get your heads flycut.

Incidentally, I had a set of these in my bus when I got it.  One 
piston also had a hole through it when I got it.  That kind of 
makes me biased against 96mm kits, which have thinner cylinder 
walls than the 1.8 kits.  I replaced them with a 1.8 (93mm) kit 
and have not holed a piston since.

&gt;You could join the 914 list at www.pelicanparts_dot_com  and sell 
them and 
&gt;spend the loot on bus parts.

I think that's a great idea.
