Subject: Clutch thickness

Hello all:

I was working to install my new clutch last night.  '78 2.0L Type IV engine 
rebuild.  Anyway, Muir's book said to replace a clutch that was less than 
5/16&quot; thick.  I measured my old clutch, and it was a hair over 5/16&quot; thick.  
I measured the new clutch and it was 6/16&quot; (OK, 3/8&quot; for you 
mathematically-correct types).

How thick should a new clutch be?  Do they wear that little?  Is 1/16&quot; a lot 
of wear in a clutch?

Thanks for the help,

Beth in Houston
