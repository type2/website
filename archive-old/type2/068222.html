Subject: RE: New Bus/Busses in movies

&gt;       I have risen above tha wannabus stauts and hve become a new owner of a '78
Valkswagen Bus 
&gt;(#2272166682). There are so many questions I want to ask, I don't know
where to begin. 

Congrats, James.  I think the VIN # reads as a '77.   I believe the 3rd
digit is the model year.

&gt;       It has a 2.0L engine and I am finding it a bitch to get started in the
morning. I have to 
&gt;pump the gas like a bastard to get it going. Is this typical? 

If it's stock, you have fuel injection, right?  That should start right up
even on the coldest of mornings.  If not you'll have to do some
troubleshooting.  Has it been converted to carburation?

&gt;wouldn't mind a break from the shifting but I don't want to screw up a
perfectly good standard and 
&gt;replace it with an automatic and be even less satisfied with that. 

I can't comment on the automatic, but I do like the standard transmissions
in the buses I've owned.  Rocky Mt Motorworks sells the complete stock shift
lever kit for like $20.  I have a stock setup on mine, but I have an angled
extenstion fitting screwed onto the end of the shifter shaft just before the
knob so it's easy to reach.  These should be available through aftermarket
suppliers.  I'm sure there will be a market for your scat shifter if you
want to resell (I think they go for $80-up new).

&gt;       Water gets in through the back door and soaks the cushion. Any remedies?

It's either your rear hatch seal ($90) or your rear window seal ($25).
After it rains, before opening the hatch, look from the inside of the bus
just below the window seal.  If you see a line of water, it's your window
seal.  If the hatch gasket is really dried out, cracked or missing, that
could also be the culprit.  

&gt;       Both seats in front are in need of replacement. Any suggestions for
cheapest route?

Cheapest solution is to find a pair of '76-79 seats out of a parts bus that
are good.  Short of that, you'll have to recover the seats, get new foam
cushions and possibly replace some broken springs while your in there (about
$175 worth of materials).  I used springs from a bed box spring to replace
some broken stock springs and they worked very well.

&gt;       Do all of these busses have a hard time passing emissions? 

No, shouldn't have a problem if everything is hooked up properly.  Did the
previous owner suggest you might have problems??
