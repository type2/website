Subject: administrivia - status file relocated!

Volks,

I have relocated the digest archive and list status file.  Due to firewall
problems, some people cannot use FTP, but AFAIK, everyone has HTTP (web)
access.  Soooo.....  the archive and the list status file are at:

http://www2.ari_dot_net/dworkin/

Bookmark it and if the list ever seems slow, check it!  If it continues
to be slow, e-mail me here or at dworkin_at_type2_dot_com, I may not have noticed
yet.

In theory, there is no difference between theory and practice. 
But, in practice, there is.
