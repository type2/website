If you haven't got a thermostat attached to the air flaps that control 
cooling air from fan to the cylinders, and if the flaps spring is keeping 
the flaps fully open all the time, then your engine will be slow in reaching 
operating temperature, and in really cold weather may never warm up fully; 
also poor heater performance would result. So, It is a good idea to use the 
thermostat, unless you live in the tropics in which case it wouldn't matter 
much. Before attaching the wire to the air flap lever (do that with the 
engine cold, and the flap lever pushed against the spring action to its 
&quot;stop&quot;), I'd make sure the thermostat is not fatigued (stretched open, i.e., 
when cold it should be compressed tightly with no space between the ribs). 
You can seriously overheat your engine if you hooked up the flap lever as 
described above with a fatigued thermostat which was already &quot;open&quot;, because 
it would be mechanically constrained to not open the flap fully when the 
engine did come up to temperature. If unsure, buy a new thermostat.
