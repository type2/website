Hey Tyler,
Just get yourself a new breaker plate.  Probably cost you about 30 bux
and it's worth it anyways.  Be sure that when you put in a new one that
you put a liberal amount of grease between the two plates so they slide
past each other nicely.  Be sure you don't let the little plastic things
fall out that keep the two plates from rubbing together.  There are
three of them...

If you need details on how to rebuild the distro, lemme know.  I have an
article on how to do it and I will also be doing a full article to be
posted on the type2 site (I'm working on it steve and sean :)

later,
Mike

&gt; So I'm driving home from Wisconsin when the engine starts running rough.  I don't have the right toolswith me, but I DO have the timing light I picked up at Trak Auto on the way out of town - run around back and find the idling engine is running about 4deg BTDC, rather than 7.5deg.  By the time I get home it's backfiring and sputtering.  I find that the points are out of adjustment, but when I try to adjust them the mounting screw strips out.  I put a little JB Weld in the hole and I go buy a fresh screw of the same size.  I get it adjusted for a few minutes, it gets rough again, and when I re-adjust it strips out again.
&gt; 
&gt; So my long-winded question is what are my options?  Do I need to replace the whole distributor just to fasten down the points?  Can I replace just that moving plate?  Does a hall sensor replace the points, and would that be a better solution?  I don't have a lot of free time at the moment, so if I can't fix it easily I may just tow it to the local mechanic.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks in advance,
