&lt;&lt;So the best bet is to order relatively small quantities for personal use and
try to specify Mail as the shipping method (or as a distant second choice,
some private carrier that is at least somewhat reputable, such as UPS). This
should minimize the likelihood of hassles or hidden costs along the way,
increasing the chances that your final cost is relatively close to what you
budgeted between the cost of goods, shipping, and duty.  Otherwise, it's a
crapshoot. Your order probably will sail right through, completely
hassle-free and inexpensively - or not.&gt;&gt;

Ron has some good advice here.  I just want to add a few thoughts.

You can import items yourself for up to $1,150 without posting a bond, or 
needing a customs broker.  The limit on textiles however, is only $250.00.

If you import any item of $250 or less in value, US Customs will waive the 
fees if these items are for personal use.

In my experience, a good Customs Broker knows more than the people at the US 
Customs office.  In fact, the local Customs office will call my broker for 
advice when they need clarification or have questions.  If you complete the 
paperwork ahead of time, your shipment can clear customs even before it 
arrives.

All imported items need to be permanently marked with the country of 
manufacturer.  A label on the box is not good enough, the item must be marked.

A lot of the European accessories and parts are not marked.  My broker says 
that this is a serious problem and US Customs will eventually catch up with 
you and issue some heavy fines, so everyone be careful and consult with a 
professional when importing.
