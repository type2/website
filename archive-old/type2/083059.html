&gt; Hello all,
&gt;      I'm getting close to putting the heads on my rebuild and I have a
&gt; question about using swivel feet adjusters.  Will it be tricky to shim up
&gt; the rocker arms or is it just use the shims that come with the adjuster and
&gt; drive on?  It's a plain vanilla 1600DP.  I'm also interested in the
&gt; pros/cons of swivel feet VS stock adjusting nuts.  Thanks, Marcus

I tried swivel feet adjusters and found that they were more of a hassle to
get set right than the original adjusters.  All the moving bits made it
harder to get the feeler into the gap.  I went back to stock.
