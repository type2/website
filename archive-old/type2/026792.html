Cool, thanks for the info. Would you know which tube it goes through so I do 
not cut it?? It's not the one those actually goes through the frame is it?? 
If so, I shouldnt have to touch it to do cross-members, or do I?
Thanks,

&gt;Dave,
&gt;
&gt;It can be done!  and peacfully too!  it is a solid 4-5 hr job, but I
&gt;flopped a '78 rear main harness into my '73 when I installed the FI in it
&gt;(some of the FI wiring is included in the main harness)  I removed the
&gt;fuse box from the front and the instrument cluster as well.  Then I
&gt;unplugged *everything* that went to the bundle of wires that headed for
&gt;the rear and fed it back thru the frame members.  On the FI, there are a
&gt;number of large plugs that will not feed the other way, but on your '72 it
&gt;might be easier to unplug it at the rear of the bus and feed it forward.
&gt;Your '72 has only the connections for the various lamps and ignition
&gt;(watch the reverse circuit!).  You will need a wiring diagram whichever
&gt;way you go, the diagram is available at:
