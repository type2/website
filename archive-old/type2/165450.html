&gt; Hi Volks,
&gt;
&gt; When I went FI with a 1973 single-outlet tank I cut down a spare
&gt; passenger side fuel rail to make a pair of metal T fittings. One of
&gt; which is in my spares pile, the other has one end attached to the
&gt; tank, one end attached to the fuel filter, and the third end attached
&gt; to the fuel return line.

&gt; It has been two years running without issue. All you need is a T, not
&gt; a tank swap.

I've seen this done and it seems to work.  By any chance have you tried
letting your engine idle while hot on a hot summer day.  That would seem
to be the worst case scenario for this setup, with maximum return fuel and
minimum new fuel being drawn from the tank.
