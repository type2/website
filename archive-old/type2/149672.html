Subject: Re: [T2] C.O. adjustment ?

&gt;&gt; Seems to rich for FI at any altitude. Do you adjust the AFM using the 
&gt;&gt; bypass screw only? &gt;&gt;If so, you'll only tweak the %CO. You need to adjust 
&gt;&gt; the wiper to really dial it in:
&gt;
I have only adjusted the bypass screw so far. Don't want to adjust the wiper 
without better test equipment. I was hoping the wiper is set correctly 
considering this is a newly refurbished AFM from BD.

What do you think a good C.O. reading should be at 7000 ft.?
