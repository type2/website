Subject: Re: [T2] wow! what a difference the SVDA dizzy makes!

I know there is bashing of the VW mags, especially the trends one (get my 
drift) but look at the current issue. Inside you will see a dyno test and 
when they switch to a different disty it does make a difference. I am about 
to give up on 009's. They arent right.

&gt;&gt;   Okay, so I was a little sceptical to all the response about leaving the 
&gt;&gt;009's for the type 1 crowd.  Could it make that much of a difference for 
&gt;&gt;in city travel?  YES IT CAN!  I am truely amazed at the extra low end 
&gt;&gt;power and I am now making since I replaced the 009 with a 021-905-205P 
&gt;&gt;dizzy.
