Subject: Re: [T2] Help! For anyone with Hankook tires on a
  Vanagon/Bubble Bus

I looked for the specs on the hankoooks, but was unable to find them. The
Continental Vanco 8's, which should be a close match in the 195R14 size are
26.2&quot; in diameter and roll 797 revs in a mile. The only Michelin tire I
could find specs on in the 205-70/14 is a p metric Harmony which measures
25.2&quot; in diameter and rolls 826 revs per mile. That's about a 4.5% reduction
in revolutions per mile.

&gt; Hi all,
&gt;
&gt; I'm trying to decide on the purchase from the Bus Depot of a set of
&gt; Hankook
&gt; RA-08 195 series (not the 185's) tires for my '87 Vanagon Westy.  Perhaps
&gt; -
&gt; OKAY! - I'm definitely getting anal about this.  I'm hoping that the outer
&gt; tire diameter of the 195 series Hankook's is a bit bigger/taller than the
&gt; Michelin MXL 205/70R14&quot; tires currently on my Carat alloys.
