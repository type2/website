Subject: Re: [T2] AFM adjustment of spring tension-how?

&quot;Instead of dealing with all of this ancient fuel injection, I got a
megasquirt EFI.  Cost me about $120, less than a rebuilt AFM, and I can
tune my entire EFI with a laptop.  It blows the l-jet out of the water
and is a breeze to tune compared to the l-jet's &quot;spring tuning.&quot;

Has anybody compared the cost, ease of installation, and longevity of the 
Bosch CIS-E vs. the Megasquirt?  Who is it that has used CIS on this list?  
Is escapes me.
