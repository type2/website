Subject: Re: [T2] alternator bracket

Thank-you Scott,
I'll have to search the wrecker for one, there is approximately 3/4&quot; offset
required in the bracket to miss the heater box uptake tube and meet the new
exhaust tube's flange.  To the best of you knowledge, do all the alternator
brackets secure their bottom end to the exhaust/muffler flange,
(necessitating a &quot;dogleg&quot; or offset bracket) or are they a different shape?
If I can't find a bracket I'll have to fabricate one as my belt is taking a
beating from the misalignment and it looks as if my alternator bearings may
now be failing (felt good after the engine rebuild).  I have pictures of my
work in progress if they would help explain what I have, I don't like
sending unsolicited enclosures.  I didn't find any pictures of a sample
bracket in my shop manuals.

Cheers,
Drew

&gt; &gt; Good day all,
&gt; &gt; 1977 2.0 bus: Does any one know if there are different alternator
brackets
&gt; &gt; for the different displacement type 4 bus engines?
&gt;
&gt; Yes.
&gt;
&gt; 72-74 and 79 have one style, 75-78 have another style. If you switch
exhaust
&gt; you have to get the appropriate bracket.
