Personally,
I feel that comments like this should be kept in your head.  If you have
built as many engines as Boston Bob, then you may criticize him.


Until then, your criticism of his product is unjustified.

Although I have not met him face to face, it seems as though I have known
him for years....he treats your motor and heads, etc., as if they were his
own.....he has very high standards, as is evidenced buy the Bentley people
using his advice and changing a valve lash procedure.........

&gt; Hi Volks,
&gt;
&gt; I believe to remove the mystique/bull of engine
&gt; rebuilding you have to ask specific questions.  What
&gt; hot idle oil pressure will I get with a Boston Bob
&gt; rebuild?  If Boston Bob tells me 7 psi is OK (which he
&gt; did). and 7 just barely keeps the VW oil sender light
&gt; out, and won't even keep the VDO oil switch off I get
&gt; cautious.  Again the simple question that Bob wouldn't
&gt; answer was what oil pressure will he guarantees with
&gt; his rebuilds.
&gt;
&gt; Now I'm not saying he should guarantee 30 psi HIOP
&gt; (hot idle oil pressure), although I believe it is
&gt; possible for top level rebuilders to achieve this (ask
&gt; Bob of Access Systems about his rebuild).  However if
&gt; Boston Bob is such a great rebuilder, he ought to be
&gt; able to guarantee at least 15 psi HIOP.  Instead, what
&gt; will he guarantee?  Nothing.  Doesn't that make you
&gt; wonder?
&gt;
