Thus spoke Derek Miller of derek_at_mail.sisna_dot_com on 1/27/01 7:10 AM:

&gt; When I let the clutch pedal out all the way while the trans.
&gt; is in neutral my Westy jumps forward and the engine dies.  Does
&gt; the cable need to be tightened?  or loosened?

Then, by definition, you ain't in neutral!

(Wot's the car's history? (Specifically transaxle and linkage))
