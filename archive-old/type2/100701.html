Subject: Re: [T2] Club Listings\ Seattle area

Pacific Northwest listees:

Cascade Kombis is a friendly local bus club, meets first Tuesday every
month,
See our Website: www_dot_cascadekombis_dot_org or p-mail me for more info.
We have been meeting since 1988, put on the annual NW Vintage VW Meet in
July,
in fact we save &quot;some&quot; of the proceeds to buy pizza for the club every
month,
but, you have to buy you own lovely beverages.
We started as a camping club, NEATO chapter, but anybody that has an
interest in
air cooled VWs should have fun.
