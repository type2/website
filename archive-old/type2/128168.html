Hi Folks,

I'm getting ready to reassemble the bottom end of my engine, and I have had 
trouble finding the nuts that bolt the HE's to the heads. Bus Depot only 
sells the nuts in packs of 100, and I'm reluctant to pay shipping on such a 
small item. Is this a Homer De Pot or Blowe's item, or is this a FLAPS 
item? If I can get them locally, what are the size &amp; pitch I should look 
for?

Thanks in advance...
