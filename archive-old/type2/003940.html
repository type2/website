Hello,

I live in a rural area and have seen very few buses here. The other day I
tried for the first time to pressurize my windshield washer reservoir. I
looked all over for my bike tire pump but could not find it, so I figured if
I was really careful I would be able to pressurize the reservoir using the
air hose at the gas station. After pumping in some gas, I hooked the air
hose to the reservoir and &quot;pop,&quot; something blew, washer fluid gushing from
under the front of the bus. That's the sad part. The funny part was when the
guy standing nearby remarked, &quot;Hey, I thought those things were air cooled.&quot;
