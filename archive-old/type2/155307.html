&gt;It appears that the large &quot;O&quot; ring goes on the Taco plate as the seal
&gt;between it and the case, then the paper gasket and lastly the cover.

Right.

&gt;So,
&gt;why two paper gaskets?  Did the seller give me one extra or am I missing
&gt;something.

I believe there was only one paper gasket. You don't need to use either IMHO.

&gt;It also appears that they all get attached at the same time with the pair of
&gt;screws that currently hold the original plate in place.

Right.
