Subject: Re: Infinitely Wise VW Engineers?? (long)

Well, George is beginning to convince me on the flaps issue, at least
for cold climates. Here in AL they're still pretty non-essential. But
I'm definitely not happy with the flap relation to the oil cooler and
that's something that can certainly be improved upon. As can the
exhaust.
   And I hope that people realize that I was playing devil's advocate
here. OTOH, what I said about American auto factories wasn't -- my wife
has owned two new cars in the last ten year, a Mazda and now a Toyota
RAV4, and we made very sure that neither was assembled anywhere but
Japan. And I agree with George, the VW is truly -- for the most part --
a very well engineered and built machine.
   But it still can be improved upon. 8-)
