Subject: bay swap

Just an FYI, another mail list I belong to, the TDI conversion list (
http://www.onelist_dot_com/community/TDI-conversion) has a thread about putting
a diesel into a bay. One guy has done it with a 72 bus and a Peugeot
engine. Another guy has announced he is starting the project with a 77 bay
and a TDI. I know a very few people on the type2 list are interested in
this so move this thread to the tdiconversion list.
