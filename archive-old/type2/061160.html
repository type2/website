&gt;nothing beats the factory stuff.  I myself prefer to sandblast damaged
areas,
&gt;then Variprime them and hit the rest of the sound paint with a DA (Dual
Action
&gt;Sander).   Prime the bus with a good sandable epoxy primer, guide coat it
and
&gt;then countless hours of blocking it out (this is where you and your bus
really bond


As I am so bonding this weekend, I'm going to put a couple of sense in, I'm
no &quot;pro&quot; bodyman, but I do better work than most &quot;professionals&quot; around
here.  These are good sensible suggestions in general, you want to avoid
bare metal as a rule if you can, but some times you will be so forced, like
on the average condition crazed bus roof or if you really want to know what
is under the paint, or if you feel there is too much paint on the bus.  A
couple things I'll add, personally I feel using PPG DP40, 90, whatever color
epoxy you want after a good metal etch and conversion coat will be easily
equal to what VW put on there 30 years back, so long as you had the metal as
clean as VW did, and so long as you can coat everywhere VW did (the major
failure problem.)  I like plastic media blasting, but the media is
expensive, check a local or regional industrial buying guide and try to find
out where dealers are buying their product from, often you can buy a 200lb
drum direct.  I have also had very little problem warping panels with
standard fine blasting sand so long as I don't dally in one spot, maintain
about a 45 degree angle to the surface, and so long as you run the pot with
a small nozzle and a bit lower pressure and sand costs $5-10 for 100 pounds,
the plastic media around or in excess of $1 per pound.  I run my Tip 99 at
about 80-90 psi with a 7/32 nozzle, and my ole DeVillbis military dual stage
compressor can run it there all day long without loosing pressure, if I want
a smoother finish I balance for more sand, more pot pressure, less
acceleration pressure.  Regarding the blocking and sanding, this is where I
am right now on the windshield surround of the truck and 2 things make my
life amazingly simpler.  First, a foam rubber &quot;Wonder Block (tm) by Motor
Gaurd Corp&quot;  Best sanding block for irregular surfaces like a bus I've ever
found, strongly rec anyone try to find one, not for blocking flats but
invaluable along the beltline, etc.  Next thing, this is the third time I've
used the polyester primer/surface and I can't say enough about this stuff.
This is sprayable gold (in color and worth.)  I'm using a gallon of product
called Z-chrome Rust Defender.  This stuff is amazing in what it can fill,
in that it does not shrink, and in that it will spray over anything without
lifting the substrate and it sticks.  A couple warnings, spray it with a
cheap gun, you need at LEAST a .070 tip, and you may want to thin it a bit
with acetone.  Doing this it will go on heavy and smooth with no appreciable
orange peel.  I use it between two coats of DP40, it says to use it directly
on bare metal, I'm unsure as I trust the PPG epoxy beyond belief.  The
Z-chrome is a savior for scratches, pinholes, all the stuff you would have
used spot putty or a heavy laquer based surfacer for without ever worrying
that it will shrink back into sanding scratches.  I did a large panel of the
'90 a year ago with it, it is still perfect today, and I pushed it to the
limit, leaving bondo at 80-100 grit scratches beneath this, Z-chrome, then
taking it directly to 220 dry, the second DP40 coat, and a 320 scuffing then
topcoat.  This stuff can save you so much time it is amazing, worth twice
the $40 I paid for the gallon.  I'll also interject that I'm still
ludicrously happy with my Sharpe gravity feed HVLP gun for my topcoat
applications but I'm looking for an economical source for spare cups, my
only gripe about the thing in general is the fact the cup holds much less
than a quart, but I knew that going in, and I think the convenience of the
gravity feed design as far as balance and size outweighs the negative.  The
&quot;HVLP&quot; functionality seems not entirely BS, there is a lot less bounce and
paint goes noticeable farther, I like it better than my friends turbine
which I always seem to spray overly dry.

Anyway just some general comments about some products to anyone who cares.
Now I'm back to the Bus.
