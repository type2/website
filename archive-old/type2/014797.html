X-Diagnostic: MESSAGE REQUIRES APPROVAL

O.K., here is where I am at. I can rent a small pop top camper from the Air
Force, and I have a super strong hitch on the Bus as it is, but I still do
not like the idea of pulling a trailer up and down the Pacific Coast with a
71 Bus. It only has a 1600dp. It runs great with the dual carbs and Empi
exhaust, but still struggles up hills and gets too hot at speeds of over 70
mph. Add 1500lbs of trailer an the poor thing will not be much fun to drive
and will overheat at slower speeds. I have all the proper tin, seals, timing
is right and what not. It is not the fault of poor condition, it is just a
small engine in a very heavy Bus. If I go with a latter Bus, with the later
style Westy interior and the larger engine, I may be better able to tow a
small trailer, I also may not need it. I would prefer to get a good New (not
original) side tent as opposed to renting a trailer all the time. After a
few rentals I could pay for a good German side tent. 
  So, I guess my plea would now be for any Westy made after about 1976. And
I guess my 71 SO-69 will be for sale. I will have to get some picture of it
up.

I know someone that towed a small popup with a MG midget.
I really think if you get one of the smaller ones without
all the added on stuff you wont have any probs.... a friend
of mine builds sand rails an they use bus trannies as he
claims they can take a lot of abuse... As you know by now I
aint no expert but I really think you can tow one of these!
I am also glad to hear you wont be getting out of buses..
we need people on the list like you!
