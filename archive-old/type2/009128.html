&gt; For my '71 Westy, I have the drive shafts off and plan to clean and
repack

&gt; Fast forward a decade to early this year.  I did this on new boots
that I
&gt; installed a thousand miles ago but three of the four are already
cracked,
&gt; a problem that many on this list have experienced.
&gt; 
&gt; Anyone have wisdom to pass on for repacking?  Only the joint or all
the way
&gt; into the boot?

I always fill the boot, but I think that the quality of boots has
dropped in the last few years.  I've had poor luck with Lobro and
Qualitat boots, both of whom are OEM suppliers.

OTOH, I tried a set of US-made Rockford Duraboots and they are doing
fine.  

The Rockford boots are a different design than the OEM boots, being
shaped more like the FWD CV boots.  This is fine, as FWD cars have to
withstand greater drive angles than our buses.

The other odd thing about the Rockford boots is that they have clamps
on both ends like the original VW boots.  I found that the clamp-style
boots supplied with the boots leaked a bit, so I replaced them with
narrow hose clamps which fit perfectly in the grooves.

Lastly, the Rockford boots are a bit shorter than the original VW
boots, so the axle-end of the boot cannot go between the &quot;bumps&quot; on
the axle.  Instead, clamp it just outboard of the outer &quot;bump&quot;.

I wasn't happy about these anomolies, but after having the boots on
for a couple of years with no discernable cracking at all I decided
that they are the way to go.

They have a web site:  http://www.rockfordcv_dot_com
 
&gt; Secondly,  on two of the four joints, the grease literally gushed
out as I
&gt; seperated it from the transaxle and wheel.  It had the consistency
of gear
&gt; oil, not of grease.  It's viscosity had somehow gone way down in the
&gt; thousand miles. Can anyone comment on this?

Were they the joints that bolted to the transmission?  If so, check
the seal (plug) inside the CV flange.  You might be leaking gear oil
into the joint, which can't be a good thing.
