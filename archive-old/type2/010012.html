A good tool for moving vw engines, especially if you have to take them up
a grade (a ramp or even stairs) is a hand truck rated at 500 lbs. Get one
of those ratchet-style straps, drill two holes at the outside of the
truck platform. that allows you to cinch the engine up tight. Then roll
it anywhere you want. The truck also doubles as a very effect lever for
getting the engine off the floor and high enough to slip a floor jack
under it.
