Subject: Solex 34PDSIT vacuum hose routing

Hello list,

I need some help hooking up the vacuum lines to the dizzy on my 72
Westy.  It has the advance/retard can on the dizzy and the Solex 34PDSIT
dual carb set up.  The left carb has 2 vacuum hose connections, one left
side one right side.  There is a switch that is attatched to the ceiling
in the engine compartment that is wired to the tranny.  The right side
carb has 1 on the left side.  And the dizzy has 2 connections, one on
the right is black the other isnt.  TIA...

Keep on truckin'

Anthony and 73 Westy and 58 SC
