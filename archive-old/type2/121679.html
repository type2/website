Subject: Clutch cable replacement frequency

A story about a clutch cable.

This morning I was sitting at the Canadian/U.S. Peach Arch border crossing, waiting in a line of nine cars, and as I started to inch forward, my clutch pedal dropped to the floor.  You know the feeling.  If I'd been going the other direction, into Canada, I could have just coasted in line, but the U.S. border post is just slightly uphill.  So I abused my starter eight times to get to the border agent and once again when he let me through, apologizing to him on the way out for the unusual departure.  Some miles down the freeway I picked out a decent parking area behind an AM/PM station and changed out the cable.  This one had parted right where the cable is swaged into the front clip.

My previous two cables had met their demise the same way; I mean to say that they parted at the front clip.  The first snapped when I was just blocks from home, and the repair was convenient.  The last one broke when I was crossing Yellowstone National Park in a snowstorm, and the repair was less comfortable.

Which brings me to my question: Does anyone replace their cable as a routine maintenance item rather than wait for it to break in an inconvenient spot and time?  And, if so, what would you think the average life would be?  This last cable of mine only made it a bit more than a year (a hard year to be sure and about 18000 miles), whereas the one before lasted about 5 years/60000 miles.  I'd be hard-pressed to pick a reliable interval for preventative cable replacement.

See you on the road,
Jerry
