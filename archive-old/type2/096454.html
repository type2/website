Subject: Re: [T2] I stink at bondo

Don,

As Dirty Harry once said...

&quot;A man's just *got* to know his limitations&quot;  &lt;grin&gt;

I just plain suck at body work..._dot_can do just about everything else in the 
world, but just don't have what it takes for the body.

I figure that it is a lack of knowing/watching a professional
at work.  There *must* be a secret to it and I don't know what it is!

Cheers, dave

&gt; Yes, I have to admit it out loud.  I know the &quot;B&quot; word  has alot of
&gt; negative connotations, but when used, for the right purpose, it works
&gt; for me (a little dent on a nice flat surface).  I just can't get the
&gt; bottom of the Big V on the nose of my '65 to look right.  I took the
&gt; entire nose down to bare metal, and found a fair  amount of previous
&gt; filler in a few spots.  I have been able to get passable results on the
&gt; other areas by myself,  but the bottom section of the V is killing me.
&gt; The myriad of small dents from the previous fix I found after grinding
&gt; out all the filler are not deep, but I just can't get it right.  I need
&gt; to call in some help. I guess I'll begin putting out feelers within
&gt; family and friends for some kind of &quot;hired gun bondo artist&quot;.  Bus not
&gt; driveable, so how much do you think one of these outlaws should get for
&gt; coming out to finish this for me?  As of right now, I know of noone I
&gt; can think of to do it, so it will probably be a friend of a friend type
&gt; deal.  I hate to even consider this option, but if it took someone an
&gt; hour and a case of premium beer, I'm all for it at this point.  Once the
&gt; nose is done, bus is ready for priming.
