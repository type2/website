Subject: looking for a 76-79 bus

Today I unfortunately hit someone on the freeway and dented the front in
pretty badly.  Luckily nobody was hurt so that was a good thing. 
However, it's going to cost at least $2000 to fix so I figure I'll just
get another body and swap everything out.

So, anyone in the Southern California area getting rid of a 76-79 bus,
let me know.  I don't need an engine or tranny, just a descent body. 
Westy would be nice, but also not needed.

thanks,
Mike
