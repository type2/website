Subject: tranny balance point?
Message-ID: &lt;Pine.SOL.4.10.10011151626170.1105-100000_at_comp.uark_dot_edu&gt;

Hi folks, I'm getting ready to remove the transmission from my 73
Campmobile and was wondering where is the best place on it to put the jack
for the least chance of tranny topple.

The engine is already out of the vehicle... I wanted to pull them as a
unit, but I was having too much trouble removing the 6mm hex bolts from
the CV joints... from all apperance, they hadn't been touched since
September 1972 (the date of assembly on the door jamb).  Once I got the
engine out and was able to sit in the engine bay, it went much more
smoothly.

Unfortunately, I'm going to have to pull the baby by myself.  I did the
engine alone as well... I used the Jenga Method of Engine Extraction...
More on that will be included on my web site if I ever get it up (it
basically involves lots of planning, patience, and 1' length 2x2's).

Thanks for any info,
Jonathan
