Subject: Fw: [T2] Full flow filter on 1600

 I was quoting what I've read. Your info is appreciated and I will use stock
VW filters if they work fine for you. I agree, Fram filters aren't reputed
to be that good. Tom

 &lt;&lt; The Fram HP1 filter is the one to use. &gt;&gt;

Aren't the german Mann and Mahle filters of much higher quality?  Its my
understanding they also have a more sophisticated bypass/drainback valve set
up.

I used a 72 - 79 bus filter on my new 1600 based full flow system and so far
it has worked fine with a stock german Mann filter. Should I be concerned
about its ability to take the pressure?
