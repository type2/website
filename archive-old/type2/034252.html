Subject: Wohoo Tune up

Just got my 72 running last night, starter was dead and seized.
Question- is the tune up procedure for a 72 with a 1700 the same as a
1600.  Im a 1600 family and this is my first pancake bus.  What is the
Valve clearance setting?  Thanks!

PS- i have dual carbs now, one os not working well.  What would be the
cheap fix? New carb, new single carb???

Thanks!
Matty
