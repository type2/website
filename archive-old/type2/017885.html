Subject: FS: Complete BN4 heater
Message-ID: &lt;37306D30.A2CBDE16_at_cais_dot_com&gt;

BN4 gas heater:  $350 + UPS if not local

&gt;From a '77 BUS!!  Pulled 95% of it last night.

Includes all ducting (to passenger compartment, and recirculating),
two pipes that go to the outside (one is obviously the exhaust, the
other is unknown at this time),
fuel pump and clear bowl gas filter,
mounting bracket for the BN4,
cable(s) and switch(s),
and the ORANGE torpedo. (Did I forget anything??)

Also, for local people, I will throw in the 'fabricated' firewall so you
don't have to cut up your own....  And the left rear quarter panel so
you can see exactly where the passenger compartment return vent has to
be cut into the side....  And, if you are really a good VW person, I
will make a template for the two round exhaust pipe holes that have to
be cut, and a set of photos of what it's suppose to look like, and some
description of the whole wiring thing, and any papers I have on it
(stuff downloaded and stuff mailed to me from Espar).

Really not a huge installation job, but not a quickie.  It only took me
5 hours to pull the system, and 30 minutes was spent looking for the two
hidden screws for the firewall removal.

Does it work??  I donno!!  There was/is a red in-line fuse on a power
line from the solenoid to the BN4, and the fuse seems to be broken at
the end.  This may have been the cause of the red trip switch that would
not stay tripped when I looked at it earlier.  Only after I pulled most
everything did I notice the 'bad' (naughty) fuse.  From the PO (and
original owner, BTW!), the BN4 did work.  Emphasis on DID...

No guarantees, but the things are there and look super nice.

Anyone local can call &amp; come by &amp; see what a BN4 heater looks like.
(Please bring a deep socket 13mm!!  I want to pull the gas tank and I
can't find my deep socket 13mm.)
