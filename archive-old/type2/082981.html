Subject: Re: [T2] AVP Engine Swap Experience (long) Part 1.

Mark,

I am in the habit of removing both at once.  Mostly for me, it is the task
of getting the input shaft splines to start and the engine/trans to line
up when I am putting it back together.  I rarely post on this because I
regard it as a &quot;religious arguement&quot;  with no right or wrong.  Either
takes about the same amount of time/effort.

Plus to pulling the engine only:
less nuts/bolts to remove

Plusses to removing both:
you can line up the input shaft on the ground
the upper right engine/starter bolt/nut is *lots* easier

Minus to pulling engine only:
the funny tilt you have to give the engine to get it past the skirt in the
rear and onto the input shaft

Minus to pulling both:
More weight
getting the front of the trans over the rear axle

Both work, and I really regard it as a personal preference item.
