&gt; Wil,

&gt; Used to use slick50 and tried to convince myself that it really
&gt; helped...concluded that it was the synth mobile one that did the

&gt; Lots of consumer groups have tested them and found them all to be
&gt; lacking in reality.

&gt; The only thing that I know of along that line that really works is
&gt; the 2 oz bottle of transmission/differential stabilizer that
&gt; Ford sells.  The last time I bought some, I asked the counter man
&gt; if he sold a lot of it.....he just laughed and said he could hardly
&gt; keep it in stock.  Mostly sold it to street and drag racers.

so you use it in the trans? or the engine?

&gt; My opinions on reality may not match those of anyone else&lt;grin&gt;.


&gt; Cheers, dave

&quot;Voice or no voice, the people can always be brought to the bidding of the
leaders. That is easy. All you have to do is tell them they are being
attacked, and denounce the peacemakers for lack of patriotism and exposing
the country to danger. It works the same in any country.&quot;
