Subject: Gasoline Heater Info (long)

It's that time again, the snow will be flying soon and you have some
choices to make, do you let your VW sit all winter, or do you enjoy driving
it on the dry winter days.  If you drive your VW in the winter, do you have
to worry about heat?  You don't need to worry if you have a gasoline heater
installed and running.  There is nothing better than to pull out the heater
control knob and give it a little turn and hear that heater coming to life,
then in the next few seconds feel that hot dry air coming out of the heater
vent!  You can even hook your heater up to a common RV thermostat so it
will come on when needed, then shut off when not, great for camping!!

There are two main heaters that were installed in VW's.  Eberspacher
heaters were installed by the factory and South Wind heaters were
installed, serviced and warranted by the individual dealerships.

This past spring, I put on a gasoline heater seminar for the KC Kombies.
Out of the research I did, I found that parts to service the heaters were
hard to find, so I decided to deal South Wind heater parts myself.  I
choose to handle the South Wind parts because these heaters are easy to
find, work on and get parts for.  Not to say the Eberspacher's aren't good
heaters, some will say they are the best, but the South Winds have more
parts available.

If you need South Wind service parts, go to:
http://pages.prodigy_dot_net/busbarn/southwind.html

Now if you are hesitant about working on your own heater, or are curious
about how it works, the seminar video and manuals can be a great help.
This is one satisfied customer's testimonial:

&quot;As I stated before, had it not been for your video and making the manual
and parts available, the heater would still be on the garage floor.  I was
going to post the success on the T-2 list, but then the price of used
heaters will shoot up at shows.  I want to get a few more before folks find
out about how reliable and useful they really are.&quot;

If you would like a video or manual, the information below will help you.
