Re breaking into your bus if keys locked in: If louver windows are loose,
reach down thru screen and unlock sliding door.  If not, I've seen (and
done) the trick of wrapping a LARGE screwdriver (or one of those narrow pry
bars that carpenters use) in cloth and prying open the front door AT TOP
jusyt enough to get in a coathangar with a loop bent at end to hook the
door lock button.  NOW when in a high crime area I unscrew the knobs and
place them in the ashtray!!!!      MB
