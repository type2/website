Subject: Westy's for sale PGH Pa.

Hi Folks
I've got to move a few to make room for some new projects.
Here's the deal:
I have 2 splitty westies(66,67) and a panel parts bus(66) and a ton of
extra parts that I would like to sell.. Package deal only!

Here's some quick info on them, email me for more details if you're interested.

'67 westy,walkthru. VERY complete camper, orig roofrack, near mint
interior. Has been stored inside for many years. Does not run, engine
does not turn.
rusty rockers and rear corners. Floors, doors, windsheild areas are rust free.

'66 westy, walkthru, Interior seems complete but not installed at this
time. Body is about the same as the 67, maybe a bit better around the
bottom, cargo doors have been worked on. po started to pull engine and
never finished so I'm not sure what's going on here. This bus has also
been in storage for 15 years or so.

'66 panel RUST BUCKET! But very low mileage, drive train is all in good
condition ready for transplant into one of the others.

Extra parts include another '67 engine, transaxle, front beam, rustfree
rear hatch and engine lid, bumpers, interior stuff and more. 

With some time and effort you could have a nice bus and sell the other
to help pay for it. 
I'm asking 2500 for the whole deal and will sell as a package only. I
can help with delivery within a reasonable distance.
