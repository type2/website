Ahh, the nearly annual fall season Weber Progressive debate, and just in
time in my case.  Although I am a staunch supporter of both D and L Jetronic
injections as the 1.7 I just gave to our wonderful listmeister came with a
32/36 DFAV with electric choke and as it seems the most appropriate thing to
put back on it a few questions to anyone with experience who can answer, I'm
not interested in icing debates or the like, we'll wait and see how it goes,
to me it seems the arguements over this carb are largely useless, it is
something you have to try for yourself to asess as for everyone cursing it
there is someone praising.

Jetting, this carb comes with 135 main on the primary, 170 air correction
(above the emulsion tube), and 45 pilot? (on the side), on the seondary
throat 140 main, 180 air correction, 50 pilot.
I have no idea how this carb ran, it was in unrunnable shape prior to
dissasembly and cleaning but has very little wear, so are these appropriate
for a 1.7?

Main question as I did not pay attention in this one area of dissasembly,
there is a metering screw like thingy extending down into the accelerator
pump, a tapered brass screw, mine has a screw on one side, and a
nonadjustable similar tapered brass plug on the other side.  Should the
screw be installed bottomed out, or is it backed out to some extent?

Choke, as there seem to be no aligment marks of any sort on the element,
generally to where should it be adjusted?

Intake runner boots, will standard bug DP runner boots work, I did not look
closely but they seem like they might and 2 are ripped on this setup.

As an aside, is the rebuild kit ludicrous for this thing or what, a genuine
Weber kit for the DFAV, DFEV cost me $25 with accelerator pump, for
essentially a measely 2 gaskets a float valve and some washers, a major rip,
the power valve was an additional $10 from one source, $20 from another.  As
only the power valve and accelerator pumps were dry rotted on mine (been
sitting 5+ years) I strongly considered ordering those parts piecemeal and
reusing the gasket.  I've bought kits for Mitsubishi DCAJet carbs, with
complexity and replacement parts known only to satan for $15, this for a
simple progressive 2 barrel is out of line.

Anyway if it runs OK for Steve I guess $35 into the thing isn't too bad,
could be $225 or whatever they are going for now days.

As a total aside, the new Gunk environmentally friendly gallon can of carb
cleaner.

WAY GOOD SHIT, and I don't often say that about &quot;environmentally friendly&quot;
products, because they are ususally Simply Worthless (tm).  This stuff
however is better than what it replaced (from what I recall of my 5 year old
can), smells slightly less but still quite a bit, does not evaporate
quickly, and parts washed up later with hot water beautifully.  Did not seem
to produce quite as bad chemical burns when I foolishly bathed with it, and
rinses off  eaisly.  Great product, if you got a carb to soak highly worth
the $10 or whatnot for the can.  One gripe, my old can has a wonderful
basket as large as the can itself, you can put the entire carb in the
basket, the new basket is downsized to a pitiful and annoying size only
usefull for small parts.
