Subject: bad brake lights, no electrons! 
Message-ID: &lt;380329C4.7EF23F48_at_mindspring_dot_com&gt;

List-

The good news is I discovered my brake light problem
before having a Honda Civic permanently affixed to my engine
compartment. The bad news is I'm not sure what to do next.

Problem: Brake lights not coming on in my 70 bus. Tail lights,
turn signals, and emergency flashers all work. The bulbs look ok
but have not yet been tested. The fuses have all been checked and
are ok.

Other problem: I read up on Bob Hoover's advice (in the archive)
about pinpointing problem before opening the master cylinder.
My dual-circuit master cyl is a bit more complicated than for the
65 he addresses. There are 6 wires total coming from the sensors:
3 per sensor. I will attempt to figure out what these are for during
my lunchbreak today, but in case I cannot it would be great to
have some backup from the list when I get home! I looked a bit at
a wiring diagram last night and quit when I saw the horn entering
the picture, but I will give it another try.

A quick inspection this am revealed that a red wire is loose from one
of the sensors. I reconnected it with an alligator clip, but it wasn't
that
easy - still no lights. Oh yes, the ignition was on (with the
distributer wire
unhooked to avoid frying the points. :^)

TIA, TTFN...
