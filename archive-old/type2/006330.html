I'd suggest starting the inspection by making sure the carb is firmly
mounted on the manifold, and that there's actually a gasket in there.  The
mounting bolts don't have to be very loose for air to be drawn in through
that interface.

The carburetor body casting material is 'relatively' soft.  It's not unusual
for an improperly mounted carb to have a slight arc across the base.  This
is the result of overtightening of the mounting bolts when a too thick, too
soft, or incomplete gasket was used.  Less common is carb base distortion
because of being mounted on a manifold with an arced mounting flange.

If base distortion is bad enough the lower part of the carb throat can be
ovaled and the throttle butterfly may be sticking or unable to move/function
properly.  A carb with an ovaled throat is beyond repair.

FWIW.....
