&gt;	I trust you're using a 3/8&quot; drive allen key tool and a flex handle
&gt;rather than a bent wire 'L' key  &amp; a pipe, yes? MUCH more torque available
&gt;that way.

Or, in a pinch, you can use the &quot;bent - L&quot; key with a cheater attached.  I
have used a 12-inch crescent wrench, inserting the key through the hole in
the &quot;wrong&quot; end of the crescent wrench, then torquing that.  I good way to
strip heads, though, since you lose a lot of control over the key.   :-/

&gt;...
&gt;	If you plan to replace the CVs anyway, you could try heating
&gt;the bolts, which will make them expand but might allow them to
&gt;break loose as they cool.
&gt;
&gt;	I tried Vice-grips unsuccessfully, but didn't damage anything with
&gt;'em, you might try that, possibly with a hex tool in the pocket so you
&gt;don't collapse it.

I've always had success with vise-grips.  Big ones with mean sharp teeth
between the pivot and the flatter pinchy bit at the nose.  You know the
kind.  The trick is the clamp them down *REALLY* hard on the bolt head.
Like really, really hard.  I've even used *another* wrench on the handle of
the vise-grips to help me jam the vise-grips closed to the locked position.
Keep a set of smaller pliers or vise-grips handy to unlock the ones
attached to the bolt head, because if you tightened them up that hard, you
probably won't be able to unlock them by hand.

Good luck!
