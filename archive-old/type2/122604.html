Subject: Engine identification

Hello!  I just discovered, and joined, this mailing list.  Thank you for
being here.

I am the owner of a 1973 pop-top bus, and I am a mechanical idiot.  It is
for me that John Muir wrote his classic repair guide.  I am just learning
about engines and just now starting to do my own maintenance on my own bus.
(Maintenance is a start!)

Last year, as the culmination of a number of dramatic scenarios (including
an engine fire in dusty Hermosillo, Mexico), I had the cylinders, pistons,
and piston rings replaced.  Unfortunately I was stuck away from home at the
time, at the mercy of an unscrupulous mechanic.  Long story short, he SAID
that he replaced my 1973 1700 cc pancake engine with a 2.0 liter engine.
(He also said this &quot;new&quot; engine had hydraulic valve lifters but it has
turned out it has solid valve lifters, so who knows what the engine is?  The
block is the same.)  I haven't had engine trouble since but right now the
bus is guzzling gas like a freakin' Hummer-- it badly needs its timing
adjusted and its dual carbs synced.  Trouble is, to what specification
should I set the timing if I don't know what the engine is?? (I've been told
the only way to tell is to pull the engine, and that's not an option for me
right now.)   I searched the mailing list library and archive and understand
about the letter codes for engines, but I don't see anything like that on my
engine block/crankcase.  Remember I am an idiot.  Could I be looking in the
wrong place?   All I saw on the crankcase was this number: 03105535.

Help!

I very much appreciate your time.  Let me know if I can give you any other
info for clarification.

Best,

Dee dee
