I did something kind of like this. When my boyfriend and I had completed the
custom woodwork in my '70, we wrote an inscription on the back panel of
wood. That panel is now covered in pegboard and I wonder when I am long
gone, if the next owner would find it interesting...

&gt; When I was carpeting the seat stands I took the opportunity to leave a
&gt; little something for someone to find when this bus gets restored again
&gt; 10 or 15 years from now, either by me or someone else.
