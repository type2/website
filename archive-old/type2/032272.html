Subject: Oil cooler seal R&amp;R, etc

Well, I got the bus into the garage - it fits fine now with the
fiberglass off the top.  I was starting to pull stuff off to make my oil
cooler seal replacement attempt with the engine in the bus when I
remembered that the #3 spark plug hole has bad threads (in a new head),
and that I need to pull the head off to chase the threads (wouldn't want
shavings dancing on top of my new piston).  So I decided that the best
thing to do would probably be to go ahead and remove the engine.  So when
I got under it to drain the oil, I noticed oil dripping from the front
(front is front) of the engine by the tranny.  Then I remembered that I
may have a leaky front main seal as well.

Definitely a &quot;remove the engine&quot; sorta deal.  So I gave up on trying to
wedge the fan housing out of there and started prepping for an engine
removal.  Whoo hoo!

I'm probably go ahead and remove the exhaust system and make the thing 70
pounds lighter or so for the removal.  One great thing about busses is
that you can get under the engine without having to jack the thing up.
There's probably 14 inches of clearance under the oil pan area.  I can
just imagine what it'd look like if I raised it up a spline.

Later,
Jonathan
