Subject: Brazilian fuel pumps from Bus Depot
Message-Id: &lt;3.0.6.32.19990611111327.0102db70_at_mail.plano1.tx.home_dot_com&gt;

I bought a mechanical fuel pump from Bus Depot to replace the leaky one on
my '73.  Noticed that it is a brand new pump, not a rebuilt original one,
and that the design is slightly different although appears to be
functionally equivalent.  I installed it - only problem there was that the
outlet pipe is in a different spot than the old one and is *very* close to
the tin - maybe 1/16&quot; away.  I had to push the tin in a bit to get the fuel
hose and clamp onto the output pipe.  No big deal, but... when I started it
up there was fuel pouring into the right carb, flooding it so that the
right two cylinders would not fire.  I checked the fuel pressure and it
pegged my gauge!  That's 12 psi, possibly more.  It should be more like 5-6
psi.  Basically the new pump is putting out too much pressure and
overpowering the shutoff valve in the carb.  SO, I unhooked the pump and
went back to my noisy (but reliable) 5 psi electric fuel pump.

Does the Bus Depot care to comment on this?

I guess I will have to buy and install a regulator if I want to use the
Brazilian fuel pump.  I don't feel like R&amp;R'ing it now that the engine is
back in.  If you are considering one of these pumps, Beware!  You have been
warned.
