Subject: Overheating rebuilt 2.0

(message posted on vanagon list also)
Howdy,
Some of you may remember me,  my name is Clay Perry and I dropped off the
vanagon list last April when I changed companies and lost the gratis net
connection.  I have a major problem with my 78 and I need the expert advice
of this group.

The problem- 
New rebuilt 2.0 overheats quickly topping 210 in five flat miles, timing has
been checked and the advance verified, the FI is in specs and not running
lean,  the oil cooler swapped and the flaps checked to verify opening and
closing. What else could it be? for more details and the whole story read on.

A bit of history-
I purchased a 78 westy with a fried clutch, and decided that what I wanted
was a good reliable system to drag around the mountains so I opted to replace
the engine and transmission with rebuilds. I bought the transmission from
 Trans Form and after checking around the engine came from Mark Stephens.
After installing the engine everything worked great but the van would not go
farther than five miles, either freeway or city  without the temperature
climbing past 210. I checked the timing several times and disconnected the
thermostat so that it was always blowing air over the cooler. I finally took
it to a local shop and had them test the injection mixture and see if it was
running lean. It proved to be a bit rich. I had them check the timing and
verify that I installed the engine correctly. We decided to change the oil
again ( I had changed it before) and found a ton of metal in the oil. I
called Mark Stephens sales guy, Bill  and he said “ sounds like a problem
send it back pronto” we pulled the motor rushed it off where it sat for three
weeks (did I mention the kept my core deposit for 120 days) they tested the
motor by putting it on a test stand running to check the oil pressure at
different temperatures and checked the compression.  They sent me a video
tape showing the motor running and what the gauges said with plenty of
condescending attitude mixed in. The metal in the oil was explained as bits
from a billet cam gear wearing in. I said “fine if you say it is OK send it
back” so I waited another week and half before calling again to hear “ we
didn’t ship it because we have been busy, and by the way you owe us $220 for
the evaluation” I said “you guys told me to sent it and you never mentioned a
charge, besides what did you do?” of course they held out and shipped it COD
so I couldn’t even sic VISA on them. The engine has arrived, the oil cooler
is swapped the timing checked and the fuel injection adjusted, still this
motor runs for five minutes and overheats. 

What do I do now? I would appreciate any advise, and if you want the
uncensored opinion of Mark Stephens motors E-mail me direct.

Clay
