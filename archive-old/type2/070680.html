Hi,

We were camping at Full Moon in Joon and a nice fellow in a Vanagon 
(Charles, I think) had some sporty magnetic screens his front windows 
and a really cool magnetic and velcro screen that covered the open 
sliding door area. The window screens were bought through JC witnee 
and when he received them there was a note in the box from the maker 
that said she also produces the slider door screens and was located 
in Winston-Salem, NC. I am looking for that contact info because I 
live so close by I would like to go pick one up in person.

Thanks
Chris
