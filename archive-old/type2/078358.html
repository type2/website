&gt; It's sure be nice to see it at BBBV!  Any eastcoasters making the big trip
&gt; to Havasu?

My only long distance plans are to get up to Cortland NY area next month,
will  be taking my bus...but the hubcap has already been up there, and I
was one of the first to carry it so unless someone was headed West from
there it doesn't seem to be a good route.
