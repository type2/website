&gt; Hello all, I have two questions.  #1 How can I tell if my 2L motor has
&gt; hydraulic or solid lifters?  The PO doesn't know and the motor has been
&gt; rebuilt more than once supposedly.

An engine with hydraulics is supposed to have spacers instead of springs
between the rocker arms and steel pushrods.... but you cannot go by this.
The only way to tell without physically removing them is by using a mini-Mag
light and look down the pushrod. Look at the top of the lifter and look for
a thin wire on each side of the top of the lifter.If you see this wire
retainer, it is hydraulic. No wires, solid.

&gt; #2 What rust breaking oils/lubricants
&gt; are you using.  All I ever use is WD-40.

WD 40 is a water dispersal product. As a rust penetrent, it is about as good
as spit! Get an over-the-counter product like Liquid Wrench, not the best
but better than what you are using. I use Rost Off by Wurth but you can't
find it in Pep Boys....
