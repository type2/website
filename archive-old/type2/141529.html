Subject: Re: Where to buy fuel line clamp

I use a small pair of vice grips to pinch the line when I pull the engine. Its not good for the long term health of the hose but it sure beats having gas pour on me while I fumble with stuffing something in the end to cork it.

 Subject: Where to buy fuel line clamp 
 
 Where do I get a &quot;fuel line clamp&quot; used to temporarily block off the fuel 
 line. (not a round clamp to clamp the fuel line to the fuel pump). FLAPS 
 drones don't understand what I am looking for.
