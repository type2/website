Subject: westy - camper stuff wanted

hey volks,

i'm looking for the following parts for my '78 westy. doesn't need to be
from a '78, just fit and look decent. i'm in la, ca but don't mind shipping.
thanks! here's the list:

- wooden 'headliner' pieces. i know, i could cut new ones but if someone has
some they want to get rid of...

- full length rear seat/sofa. i need more sleeping space instead of a
tempermental fridge :-)

- front table and leg that hooks onto dash

- windshield washer pump and parts

- front emblem from an early loaf, the bigger one but not the splitty type.
gonna put it one my spare tire cover :-)

- all exterior handles with matching key.

that's it! thanks again!
