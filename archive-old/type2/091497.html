Subject: Accu-fire rehabilitated?

I picked up a Compu-fire today from my local vdub
parts house. They also offered me Accu-fire at $20
cheaper.
I told them i had heard ungood things about that
system.
They acknowledged that the &quot;original&quot; accu-fire did
have a high failure rate, but it was recalled and the
problem fixed.

They received the improved accu-fire units a month ago
and have sold several and have not heard of any
problems--yet.

So, who wants to be a guinea pig? I plunked down $70
for the real mccoy. (The VW flaps owner, himself, uses
compu-fire in a baja bug and has never had a problem.)

Still, I wish had taken the time to examine the
Accu-fire, just out of curiosity.
