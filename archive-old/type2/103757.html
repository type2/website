Subject: CVS clamps and half axles

What I have done when re-using an old boot that continued to slide down the
axel was to use a electrical cable tie. Worked a treat and being light
plastic shouldn't need to worry about being off balance (not sure if that's
an issue though).
Definitely clean the CV's and have a look. If there's not pitting of score
marks they will be fine to re-use, they do last a long time when maintained.
Make sure you re-pack them properly with grease. I think they take 90grams
of CV type grease.
Not sure which is the better option if you need to replace, we don't have
complete assemblies to choose from here in Oz.
