Subject: RE:steering stuff

OK,
  After reading the posts on checking for cracks on an around the
steering stuff
I crawled under Gunter and did a check,,,all looks good cept this 1/2&quot;
or so soft
rubber hose which connects just in front of the brake master cyl. and
heads up
to a connection which is just under (forward) the driver's seat. Now
this isnt the brake fluid
feeder tube frm the reservoir but is well forward of this hose. I cut
off the bad part
and reconnected it. I looked in my manual and it wasnt identified.
   Anybody know what it is and does?
   Also, check out this bus site. A artist's comeing bus trip.

   Additionally, I am not a
machinist,,,but here at Boeing they take special
precautions when working with magnesium, so I would look into it before
working with it.
   Lastly,,,,thanks for the heads up on the Coupling Disc,,I will look
at mine
tomorrow. Lastly, lastly. Thanks to all of you who help keep this
resource
up and going,,,and to all of you who give us excellent advice (Sean,
etc.)
and information (Ron, etc.)
   All of you have expanded my working knowledge of my bus. My sincere
thanks goes out to all of you!
