Subject: Question on Heat/Air Knobs

I have a 74 and a friend found some Heat/Air knobs off his 72 or 73 (he
can't remember which).

Does anyone know if they are interchangeable with the 74? If he lived
around the corner, I'd just drive and find out...but he's a few states away
and will ship them to me if I can use them. But making him send them to me
unnecessarily is not a nice thing to do.

Thanks in advance,

Stephanie
