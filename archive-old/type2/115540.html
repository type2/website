Subject: cylinder removed. now how to remove key. disassembly?

Ok,
thanks to everyone who looked at my other messages concerning this. You've 
helped me to remove the lock cylinder. But Now I need to remove the key from 
the cylinder. I thought by removing the cylinder I would have access to the 
key and be able to pry it up. But it appears as if I don't. Is it possible 
to gain access to the piece of key inside the cylinder? Can I dissassemble 
the cylinder? Is there an easier way?
Also, on the botttom of the cylinder there is a piece that sticks straight 
down in the center of it. maybe about a 1/4&quot; long. What is it for. Mine 
broke off. Do you think it could be reattached with some sort of liquid 
weld.  If it is for the steering lock only and it can't be fixed I may not 
replace it.
Thanks,
Kyle
