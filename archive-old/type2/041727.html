Subject: About my monster motor...

Quick note because I've received a few questions about the high-performance
Bus motor I'm building.

At the current time I'm doing bodywork and collecting parts. I don't like
the idea of letting an assembled motor sit while working on the rest of the
car, so I'm going to finish the body first then do the suspension (including
brakes), then the interior, then finally build the engine and put the car on
the road. This also lets me take my time with the body so it will be done
properly--if you have a running engine you want to put it in and go for a
ride. No engine, and you don't have any little demons poking you in the butt
going &quot;c'mon, Jim, let's jump in this thing and go get some Krystal
burgers.&quot; (The Krystal stand I'm thinking of is in Nashville, Tennessee--
there are none in Fayetteville. And FWIW, a Krystal burger is like a White
Castle if you know what they are, or a square burger that's about 2&quot; on a
side and contains approx. ten grams of meat if you don't. They sell fifty
million a year and use three sides of beef in the process.)

Bodywork! I found the Sikkens dealer here in town. He claims it's going to
take three to four liters of paint to do this job; if anyone's painted a Bus
does that sound about right? It sounds reasonable to me.
