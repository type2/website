Subject: [T2] Fuel pump randomly turning on

Hi all,
I've noticed over the past couple of days that sometimes when I go out into
the driveway, I'll hear what I believe to be the fuel pump running (76 2.0L
FI).  If I stick the key in the ignition and turn it to on and back off, the
pump turns off.  This doesn't sound like a feature that I want to have.
Anyone know what I should be looking for?  Relay shot?  Ignition switch
shot?

TIA,
Niall
