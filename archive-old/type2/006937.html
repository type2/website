&gt;would prefer a westy wihtout the stove/sink/fridge stuff (I assume they came

&gt;all that stuff out?

Take it out and give it to me...   :&lt;)

&gt;   Lastly, is it possible to
&gt;find one in any other color besides brown, orange, or monkey-vomit green?

Hey, Watch what you're callin' monkey vomit!!.......  got 2 of 'em that
wonderful color  :&lt;)

oh, and to answer your question - NO, if you want a '76-'79.  you're stuck with
chrome yellow, MONKEY VOMIT GREEN (that's actually the official name - I'm
serious - call your dealer!) and Mexico biege.
