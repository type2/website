Subject: 78 Charcoal Canister exploded

I cracked open one of the charcoal canisters (171 801 201A) I picked up at
the junkyard today.

The lid was sealed to the body and it had me puzzled for a long time. To get
the lid off I had to use a utility knife and cut in from the top. This is
tricky work or you'll make a mess and ruin the top. Cut along the yellow
line in my picture.

Under the cap is a spring and a grate and filter keeping the carbon pellets
contained. From the bottom you can see a tube from the fuel tank is about
half way up the inside of the canister and there is a white filter on the
other end.

The case is simply made of plastic, there is no metal lining on the inside
like the older models described in the archives.

The pellets are really fine, like candy sprinkles. There was about 6 cups
worth.

I'm going to refill it and use some black silicone to seal it back up.
