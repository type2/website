Subject: let's kick rear wheel alignment
Message-Id: &lt;l03130300b3b7d40f5d8b_at_[206.163.180.51]&gt;

the p-mails on torsion bars and rear alignment have  been thoughtful and i
hope to see more comments on rear alignments. the archives are pretty bare
under &quot;rear alignment&quot;. hopefully this can change (unless the subject was
brought here recently and its not in the archives yet). or maybe its not
necessary; see below.

my rap began with my guru-recommended alignment shop not having the
'wear'-with-all to provide a rear wheel alignment for type2's. it's just
something that wasn't ever done (there).  the reason the numbers on my
westy being out of the range with factory specs in the computer were caused
by &quot;possible age-old sagging torsion bars&quot;. hence, my previous post about
torsion bars. armed with bently photocopies, i returned to the alignment
shop to deliver picture descriptions on rear alignment to be discussed over
bad coffee and worse doughnuts.

my question to our group is when you get your realignment, do you ask for
rear checks and changes, or just bail on it? is is something you and your
shop concern yourself with.

also, if any list volks in the eugene, oregon area know of an alignment
shop that has the love for type 2's, please pass their names this aways? i
want the love. well, not for me exactly.
