Subject: Accelerator Pedal Broke OOHh NOooo!
Content-type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII

Howdy Volks,

I have searched the archives on this subject without success.  Maybe one of
you have experienced a similar problem.

For a couple of month's now my accelerator pedal would start to slip little by
little over to the right getting closer and closer to the stick shift.  In
this position it would not return always seemed stuck, until I bent it back
into place.  Come to find out I had an extra return spring going from the
cable to the coil bracket!!!  The archives did reveal that this second spring
is not necessary.  The return spring on the carb linkage should be sufficient
for return.  The tension was very stiff with that extra spring.

With all that in mind I detached the extra spring then straightened the pedal
one last time when &quot;D'oh&quot; it broke at the bottom.  Luckily I had an extra
pedal but somehow I have a feeling that the pedal is not hooked up right.
When I replaced the broken one I installed the new one just like the old one
had been, but it just doesn't seem right.  The &quot;S&quot; shaped pushrod that goes
from the pedal to the linkage is attached at both ends by a spring clip and a
&quot;c&quot; clip.  Right now the pushrod is installed through the tab at the back of
the pedal and through the hole in the linkage lever, then the spring clip and
c-clip at the ends to keep the pushrod in place.  Is this right?  It still
allows the pedal to shift a little to the right.  

If any of you have had to deal with this please let me know.  This is really
frustrating.
Also, do you think that the extra tension on the cable possibly stretched the
cable?  I should probably replace it.  I have been driving with the extra
spring since my new motor was installed 9 months ago.  Still kind of new at
all this.

TIA
