Hi all,

von Kermit has been sick for a wee while now and I didn't have time to look at it my self so off he went to the doctor yesterday. The doctor has performed open heart surgery and the results can be found at http://www.geocities_dot_com/Yosemite/Forest/2679/interest.htm for anyone who may be interested.

(Just a change from the tyres/petrol tank sender/heater posts.)

Have a good day!

John
