Subject: Speaker Positions....?

I've just been out and bought a new stereo system for my camper
conversion '68 type 2 - my question is...

        1: what speaker set-up can you recomend

        2: where would you put the speakers

I want to get as good a sound as possible up front (the camper is open
pla &amp; walk through) - and to get e goo sound when I'm up back....

Any ideas will be greatly appreciated...

Thanks in advance,

Jonathan
