Traci's smarta$$ comments :-)  And I'd also like to say thank you very =
much to Matt? and John for helping me set up my new tent in the dark =
friday night!!!!  =20

The friendship, chili, swimming, v-dub show, and of course the campfires =
were excellent!  There's nothing quite like a bit of beer, good friends, =
and a fire built by Frank. Saturday night was the best fire i've ever =
seen in my life!!! :-)=20

I hope a good time was had by all.....thank you so much to everyone for =

great bunch of people!!  Hope to see you all at Bus-n-Grooven in =
