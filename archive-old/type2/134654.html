Subject: CV boot repair idea

&lt;So I'd be better off with the little shreds that are all that's on there
now? &gt;

No.  I really did the following on a bug I had in the '70's, and it held
just fine until I drove it to the junkyard many years later.

One of the rear boots was shot, and the best I could do was to put some
fresh grease in there and wrap a length of rubber roofing (called EPDM)
around the joint like an ace bandage, wrapped in the direction that the axle
rotates, so that if water or grit were splashed onto the 'open' end of the
wrap the spinning would fling it away.  The rubber was long enough, and then
some more, to fit past the flanges where a one piece boot normally
terminates, and held tight at each end with ordinary worm gear hose clamps.
You'd think that the flexing up and down would shake it loose or off, but it
never did, and that car got driven hard.

You can get all this at any big box store, and probably most little
hardwares (my personal favorite).  The EPDM might be hard to find in small
quantities, but if you called any roofer  and they'd have more scrap left
over on most any commercial job than you'll ever know what to do with.

Good luck on your trip.
