Subject: RE: Mexibusses and conversion factors

Volks, thanks for all of the replys and encouragement on importing a
Mexi bus. What I have found out so far...
**You can buy one and after a period of time ( unknown att) you can
register it in this country.
**Bring in the info on it to DMV and say you lost the title and get a
new
one issued.
   Now I dont know if these would work or not but ai dont think I would
go
either route. I do have a friend in Mexico City who is looking in to the
process
with his friends at V.O.M. (Volksie of Mex.). will let you all know if I
find anything
more.

   To convert any unit of measurement to its metric or standard
counterpart go to
this site,,,,it has been up for a looong time and is real handy.
