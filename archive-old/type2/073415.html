Message-Id: &lt;v04011709b3b3fb2ba7ce_at_[199.232.76.79]&gt;

I want to replace the calipers on my '71 westy. the left one is actually
broken at the upper bolt that holds it in place so it needs replacement
soon. But i think it would be a good idea to do them both at the same time
while i'm at it.

Bus Depot offers two new, non-rebuilt calipers. one is brazilian, one is
German [ATE]. the price difference is about $30, with the ATE calipers
costing more. is one better than the other? my inclination is to go for the
german calipers just because, but i'm wondering if anyone can recommend one
over the other.
