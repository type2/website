X-Diagnostic: MESSAGE MAY NOT BE TOPICAL

     For those wondering what that message was about, it contained a worm 
     virus that loaded when you run happy99.exe. The IS dept at work gave 
     me a description I've attached below. So don't run it!
     
     Since I have now de-lurked, here is some info about my bus:
     76 camper conversion (don't know which name, but it's a nice 
     interior). I've had it for a year and a half now. I'm getting some new 
     sills welded at the moment, and hopefully I can pick it up this 
     weekend :) I'm in Southampton, England.

     ___________________Stuff abou the virus____
      
     W32/Ska is a worm that was first posted to several newsgroups and has 
     been reported to several of the AVERT Labs locations worldwide. When 
     this worm is runit displays a message &quot;Happy New Year 1999!!&quot; and 
     displays &quot;fireworks&quot; graphics.
     The posting on the newsgroups has lead to its propagation. It can also 
     spread onits own, as it can atach itself to a mail message and be sent 
     unknowingly by a user. Because of this attribute it is also considered 
     to be a worm.
     
     All users who receive the attachment via email should as Rob said 
     simply delete the mail and
     the attachment. 
     
     The worm infects a system via email delivery and arrives as an 
     attachment called
     Happy99.EXE. It is sent unknowingly by a user. When the program is run 
     it 
     deploys its payload displaying fireworks on the users monitor. 
     
     Note: At this time no destructive payload has been discovered.
     
     When the Happy.EXE is run it copies itself to Windows\System folder 
     under the name SKA.EXE. It then extracts, from within itself, a DLL 
     called SKA.DLL into the Windows\System folder if one does not already 
     exist. 
     
     Note: Though the SKA.EXE file file is a copy of the original it does 
     not run as the Happy.EXE files does, so it does not copy itself again, 
     nor does it display the fireworks on the users monitor.
     
     The worm then checks for the existence of WSOCK32.SKA in the 
     Windows\System folder, if it does not exist and a the file WSOCK32.DLL 
     does exist, it copies the WSOCK32.DLL to WSOCK32.SKA.
     
     The worm then creates the registry entry -
     
     HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\RunOnce\S
     ka.exe=&quot;Ska.exe&quot; 
     
     - which will execute SKA.EXE the next time the system is restarted. 
     When this happens the worm patches WSOCK32.DLL and adds hooks to the 
     exported functions EnumProtocolsW and WSAAsyncGetProtocolByName. 
     
     The patched code calls two exported functions in SKA.DLL called mail 
     and news, these functions allow the worm to attach itself to SMTP 
     e-mail and also to any postings to newsgroups the user makes.
