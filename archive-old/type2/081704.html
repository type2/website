Subject: Re: [T2] engine removal/supporting tranny

I think you can safely skip that one.
The front mount is pretty heavy duty as well.  I've pulled a few and never
had a need to support the tranny, front or rear.

Then again, maybe I just learned something.  Karl or Tim, got any advice for
us on this one? :-)

I was just following Bentley's recommendation.  I'd love to skip
that step if it's not needed.  I'm a T2 novice so when I read the
&quot;make sure to support the front of the tranny&quot; part in Bentley, at
first I thought &quot;I never had to do this with a Beetle&quot; but then I had
had visions of my tranny dropping and breaking on the concrete floor
so I just went along with what the book said.
