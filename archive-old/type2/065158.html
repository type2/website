Subject: Re: Head lights brightening?

&gt;
&gt;When I drive at night I notice my head lights occationally get brighter 
&gt;and then return to normal.  They don't seem to do this at any particular 
&gt;time. I immediately think it must be the voltage regulator but is there 
&gt;any thing else is could be.  I also notice it with the interior light so 
&gt;it isn't just the head lights.  By the way, where exactly is the voltage 
&gt;regulator on a 77 bus?
&gt;thanks,
&gt;brett

My '77 Westy did this the entire time I owned it.  Never did bother to try 
to find out why. It never got better or worse, and never really became a 
problem, so I just accepted it as part of my bus's personality.  The 
voltage regulator is on the firewall on the right side (in the engine 
compartment all the way towards the front of the bus, towards the right).  
In my case, replacing the regulator had no effect on the above problem.
