What do you mean, big fake?  You mean a gas
guzzling, electronic and power everything, TV
screens in the captains chair wonderbus isn't
like the real thing?  :)  Not to mention those
hideous headlights.  I might have been interested
if they put New Beetle bug eyes on it.  Forget
it.  I don't buy anything for 40,000 that isn't
built on a foundation.  

&gt;What will the poor, dear, little, wannabees do
now, that they can't buy a van with &quot;'emotional'
styling,&quot; to relive the '60's (that they missed,
since they hadn't been born yet)?

Wait a minute.  I missed the sixties.  

&gt;I guess they'll just have to paint flowers and
&quot;chicken's feet&quot; on new Astro vans.....

Isn't this the last year for the Astro?  What is
the diffence between the gas guzzling v6 Astro
and the gas guzzling v6 EV anyway.  How about the
Nissan Quest?  It's French anyway... probably
don't need the chicken foot.  

&gt;Hey!  With a fart-can exhaust, it could be 
kewl............

Don't forget the airbag lowered suspension and a
set of those stupid spinner rims.    

You know, restyling the EV to be somewhat more
microbus-like is a nice thought, but I'd probably
be interested in damn near anything that VW would
bring to market if it was economical and
utilitarian.  I would probably buy a Eurovan with
a TDi and manual, preferably with the weekender
package.
