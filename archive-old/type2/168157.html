Subject: Re: [T2] Brake lights not working

In a message dated 9/3/07 10:10:40 PM, toddjasp_at_bellsouth_dot_net writes:


&gt; My brake lights don't seem to be working. Where is the brake light
&gt; &quot;switch&quot;? Is that in the back of the Bus? or the front by the brake pedal? 
&gt; My
&gt; wiring was trashed and I've replaced almost all of it, but that still 
&gt; doesn't
&gt; seem to be working. I assume that there is a brake switch that completes the
&gt; circuit to ground? Or is it positive?
&gt; 
&gt; 
   The brake light switch (two of 'em, IIRC) are pressure switches mounted on
the brake master cylinder...
