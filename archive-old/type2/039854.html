Subject: RE Tools

    Tools fall into two catagories, those that round nuts and bust knuckles 
and those that dont.
    When I was young and poor, some would also insert dumb, I broke a lot of 
bolts and skinned a lot of knuckles. Working on cars was not fun and took a 
lot of time.
    Now that my tools are mostly snap-on or craftsman jobs get done faster 
with better results and less blood. Buy the best you can afford and on the 
ones that'll get you hurt if they break, buy the very best. &quot;Why is there 
never enough time to do the job right, but allways enough time to do the job 
over&quot;
