Subject: Re: [T2] Slightly OT: Air Compressor Recomendations?

BJ,

It is all about tank size and flow. Flow out of the tank and air flow into
the tank. The larger the tank, the longer the tool will run at full
pressure. However, the larger the tank, the longer it takes to fill.

So, what type of tank is best?

A &quot;Home Depot&quot; special Husky brand with a 28gallon tank (like I have) is
pretty good for air ratchets and smaller devices. But it drains awfully fast
and only has a single piston compressor. But has wheels and is mobile. So if
you are a patient person, it would do just fine and is in your price range.

A dual stage 100-200 gallon compressor is the way to go if you want to do
any sanding or cutting because it fills the tank and provides positive
pressure at the same time. BUT, it is really heavy, usually 220volt and can
be pricey.

So I would recommend finding a garage sale or thrifty nickel ad sale and
picking up a 55 gallon compressor with a 120 volt oil lubricated motor. I
think you will be happy. Just don't try to spray an entire Bus with it!
You'll burn up the motor!

Have fun!

&gt; Hello All,
&gt; I'm in the market for a quality, decent Air Compressor to do my own body
&gt; work and run all the basic air tools. I might want to do some painting,
&gt; nothing spectacular, no show quality stuff.
&gt; Possibly the tiny tiny bit of sand blasting (just a cheapo harbor tools
&gt; sandblaster, no cabinent dealy or anything).
&gt; The big limiting factor is it has to be 120v. My house doens't have any more
&gt; room on the box and I have no spare 210 outlets.
&gt; Somewhat portable is always nice too.
&gt; Price is 2nd to quality. I don't have, you know, $1200, but if a $400
&gt; compressor is way better than a $300 one, or whatever, I'd spring for the
&gt; $400.
&gt; 
&gt; Anyone have any suggestions? Even just brands or places to buy or anything?
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks for any help!
