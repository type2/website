Subject: Broken valve stem
Message-Id: &lt;199905151243.FAA27662_at_helix.ucsd_dot_edu&gt;

I am fairly certain that my #1 intake valve stem is broken. (2.0L, FI) But
I want to make sure it isn't just that the keepers didn't seat, and I want
to find out where the stem broke, if it broke. 

So does anyone have a way for getting the rocker gear off without having 
the spring explode out of its seat? 

I also want to be able to put everything back in place, pending the day 
that I drop the engine. I want to be able to start the bus and move it (to 
prove that I can move it). So how can I get the spring back in while 
everything is in situ? Or, if I leave the spring out, could I also take 
the pushrod out without damage to the lifter? 

TIA
