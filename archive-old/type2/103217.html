Subject: Re: [T2] removing rear brake drums

Here's a good project for those talking about their welders a couple weeks
ago:

To pull a stubborn drum/hub, if you have another wheel laying around that
you can do without, weld a couple arms from the wheel to a large nut in the
center, kind of teepee style.  Bolt the wheel to the drum/hub and screw a
bolt through the nut onto the axle.  Makes a wonderful and cheap hub puller.

&gt;&gt; Pity that VW didn't put a couple of threaded holes in the face of the drum
&gt;&gt; to allow us to insert a bolt to push the drum off.
&gt; 
&gt; My drums do have one threaded hole - but not really enough to get it off. What
&gt; worked OK for me was to thread the lugnuts on and use a 3-arm puller centered
&gt; on the hub and grabing the lug nuts. You want to be VERY, VERY careful to
&gt; apply pressure steadily and make sure the arms are pulling straight. You don't
&gt; want to bend your studs.
