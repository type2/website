Here's the story:  number on left is his ref #.  Prices are reasonably
negotiable,  some trades acceptable. If no price is listed, it is either A)
expensive, but he would rather talk it out with you before a final price is
made, OR 2) really cheap, and he wants to see what you think is fair for a
(usually) used part. He WILL consider moneyback returns if you are unhappy
with something.
 Ten minutes of free advice, he says, otherwise the clock is    ticking
;).  There are many parts not listed, as he is still digging, so feel free
to call.   His name is Louis Cowdrey; his number is 512-447-6687; please
call between 11 AM and 6 PM CST.
