Subject: Re: Bike, ski racks (for a '76)

&gt;I have been seeking ways to install a bike/ski rack on my '72 Westy. These
&gt;are the roof-top Yakima, Thule types ... the current manuals for these
&gt;products call for drilling holes in the pop type and mounting the brackets
&gt;there. I'm not hot on the idea of drilling into my poptop, especially since
&gt;it seems like sooner or later the whole thing will start tearing from the
&gt;pressure. 

I have the same question. I would like to put a bike rack (like the 
thule) on my van. My van is '76, but with no poptop, just a regular top 
in metal.

Do you know if it exist something for me??

Thank you.
