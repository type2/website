Subject: Re: [T2] rear seat belt bolt size

&gt;  &gt;Are you sure they are 11mm??
&gt; I know seat belt bolts are 7/16&quot; fine thread on all cars. Perhaps this size
&gt; would work?

&gt;  What the hey? The King's threads in my VW?  Is is true?

  ----------------------------------------------------------------------

&gt; Yes, seat belt holddown bolts are standardized worldwide. 7/16-20

And they're not &quot;the King's&quot;.  That would be Whitworth.  7/16-20 is a
'Merican thread!  :)
