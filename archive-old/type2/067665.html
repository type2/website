&gt;I'm glad you accentuated both the low speed, and the point about the 
&gt;roof rack. It seems &quot;obvious&quot; that any object that breaks the clean flow 
&gt;of air over the surface, such as a roof rack, would cause additional 
&gt;drag. At higher speeds, this drag adds up quickly. The addition of a small
roof mounted air foil dropped this 
&gt;loss by 35%, in one test, by diverting airflow into the low pressure 
&gt;area. (This test was done on an American station wagon, traveling at 65 
&gt;mph.)
&gt;
&gt;When reducing drag, one area often &quot;overlooked&quot; is the underside of the 
&gt;vehicle.
