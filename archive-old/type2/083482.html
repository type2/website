Subject: Re: [T2] Modern Brake Switch

&gt; &gt; I've had too many close calls with the standard slow responding switch
&gt; &gt; mounted on the master cylinder. I figure a modern switch would give those
&gt; &gt; tailgaters another second of warning to start to react sooner.
&gt;
&gt; If you want really quick reaction, install a switch the lights the brake
&gt; lights when the throttle is closed.  That way they'll see the lights
&gt; without having to wait for your foot to reach the brake pedal!
&gt;

A randomizer that just flashes the brakes whenever would  keep the
tailgaters on their toes. :)
