type2 Digest 20 Mar 2007 17:00:00 -0000 Issue 7844

Hey Tony,
If thats the Front Beam you got from me back in 1999 in Long Island City, I
can tell you I pulled
it out of a 1973 bus that had been sitting in someone's driveway for years
in Franklin Square LI.
I doubt it was a repro as the guy said he used the bus for camping for
several years then his kids
got old and he just let it sleep. He was a Frog scientist and was more
interested in showing me the
frogs he was breeding in his backyard. I really doubt he'd ever have
switched out the beam. He was
suprised when I removed the entire front end and backed the bus out onto the
street using my Sears floor
jack under a system of plywood I'd laid down...once in the street the tow
guy just put a hook under the front
and drove off wheeling it on it's back wheels.

The front beam I'm workin' on has a number painted on it

206 A014 or
206 4014

The fourth digit/letter is almost scratched away...

Is this an &quot;original&quot; beam in really good condition
or a replacement beam (in really good condition...?-)
