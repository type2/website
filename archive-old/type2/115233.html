Subject: Re: [T2] Dielectric grease

Hey-
Putting a light coat of dielectric grease on any electrical connection that
may be subject to corrosion in a good idea, and can save you some headaches
down the line. In addition to all of the regular connections inside the bus,
the outside 120v plug (if you are so-equipped), is a good candidate for
protection.  I use a silicone based product called GLY made by Travaco.
Cheers,
Matthew

&gt; Should I be using some type of anti corrosive grease on electrical
connections?
&gt; If so what is a good brand or what main ingrediant should I look for?
