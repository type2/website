Last weekend instead of anybus, my son and I went south to Disney and
stayed at ft wilderness.
Getting ready for the trip was half the fun, Check everything, new
shocks and steering damper (pin bushing a bit loose do it soon). Engine
timing was at the late 2 litre setting of 7.5 BTDC but it seems happier
at the early 4.5 ATDC (does not ping) and runs nice and cool.

Drove down at 65-70. Not good mileage, 14 mpg. At Epcot we actually got
to ride on the test track. Well it only goes 65 the camper can go much
faster, and it has a radio :) But it was better then most of the other
rides.

I was not impressed by the animal kingdom. It was raining so we did not
stay too long. But the countdown to extinction ride reminded me of the
bus ride down, the cross winds were fearce! Younger kids would like it
though.

On the trip north while at a gas stop in Georgia the big hose that
leads to the gas tank came loose!! Not much spilled and I was able to
fix it before anyone noticed. Just a loose clamp.
Pull the brain, pull the air box, pull the round cover, twist the arm
into impossible position to tighten the clamp.

Then 10 miles further on the head temp sensor came loose and made the
engine cut out. Simple fix.

10.5 hrs down and 11 hrs up (extra time for fixing) Raleigh NC to
disney main gate.

One last bit. It seemed to take forever to drive the 600 miles down
there. In fact the Odometer only said 530 miles (right size tires too).
So on the trip up I used mile markers to compare. The speedo had been
making some clicks every once and a while but I never realised it was
every mile! At about the .4 mark the numbers would stop and hold  and
then there was a click and it moved on. Blast! thats why. No wonder the
mileage was a bit low too. 

#3, A yellow 75'  Westy , 2 litre, hydraulic lifters, injected, 73
exhaust system from Raleigh NC.
