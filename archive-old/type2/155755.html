Subject: Re: [T2] Yet another Roadtrip!

&gt; Geez! If only you'd been driving about a 4-ton vehicle
&gt; when the cop shut off his lights! He wouldn't have had
&gt; much of an excuse when you braked hard for that
&gt; jackalope!



I thought about it. But he was too far back. Unfortunate, that. But that's
what I get for driving through Utah in the middle of the night. On a Friday
night no less!


I must have missed the resolution of the wandering
&gt; dwell issue. What was the answer?


Crapped out meter! Both my tach/dwell and my multimeter went south on the
trip. I don't know how or why. :-( So I bought an Actron combo unit, called
an &quot;engine analyzer&quot;, from Pep Boys for $50. Has tach, dwell, and multimeter
all in one. Of course this was after replacing the points, condensor, and
coil. Ah well, I've always wanted a Bosch blue coil. ;-)



I think all my T4 stuff is gone, but I might have a
&gt; press reg - I'll look - and if so, it's yours. -BaH
&gt;

That would rock! I was surprised how expensive they are. (Though still cheap
by more modern vehicle standards.)
