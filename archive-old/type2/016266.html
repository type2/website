Pardon my asking an extremely basic question, but it's Friday, and I don't
know much about busses yet...

My friends and I are looking for a VW bus to use to transport us to bike
rides &amp; races.  The problem is we don't know what year/model/type/etc to look
for.  This is kind of what we want to do with it:

Condition wanted:  Running.  Can have paint problems, can need lots of work,
but needs to run.  We're willing to sand/paint/rebuild/etc to make it look
okay and run reliably.
Price: somewhere around $500 or so.
Use:  haul bikes &amp; people.  We will build custom racks to attach to the roof,
need to have as many people seats as possible, or the room to put some people
seats.  Most drives will be 100 miles or less.
Speed:  Slow is okay.  When you ride all day at 20 mph, getting in a car at
50 feels real fast...

I would really appreciate any info on the different busses, so we know which
one will fit the above criteria.

Oh yeah, We are in the Nashville, TN area if anyone knows of a bus we can
rescue.

Thanks!
