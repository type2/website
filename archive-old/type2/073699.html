On 10/12/01 7:48 PM, cara_at_technostate_dot_com thus spake:

&gt;	I have a 76 bus that needs a new head gasket. I had contemplated taking the
&gt;engine out, but I am moving from Alameda to Palo Alto and thought it might
&gt;be easier to tow the bus to Palo Alto. The only problem is that my mechanic
&gt;is too far away. Does anyone know a trustworthy mechanic in the Palo Alto
&gt;Area? Or does anyone have the tools to take the engine out? It is a 2000cc
&gt;fuel injected.

I've had good luck with Fred's Garage in Redwood City. Not quite Palo 
Alto but closer than Alameda.
