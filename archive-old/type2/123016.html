Subject: Electrical Contact Cleaner/Sealant

I am having tropuble with my FI on the 78' Westy 2.0. I believe I am the
victim of corrosion because my bus ran great the last time I drove it (3
weeks ago) and always has run great. The only thing that has happened to it
since the last drive is the elapsing of 3 weeks of damp and cold weather.
Bus starts but refuses to idle/ continue running without constant pumping
of the gas pedal. I am going to start testing the FI this weekend but
figured before I get busy with the test light and ohm meter I would clean
all of the electrical connections in the engine compartment. What I am
wondering is what do you guys like to use to prevent corrosion from
returning? I plan to use some fine grit sandpaper and wire brushes to clean
all the grounds and contacts but I would like to maybe spray something like
dielectric grease to prevent the recurrance of corrosion.

Also, not bus related but, has anyone replaced an upper suspension link on
a 99 Passat V6? I have not even pulled the wheel to see what it looks like
but the dealer just advised me that that was what was making noise in my
front suspension. Its a dealer only part and they want 1.5 hours to replace
it. I think I can probably do it myself though. Also need to do CV boots on
the Passat as well,nightmare or not?

TIA
