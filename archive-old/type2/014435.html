I wonder about that as well.  I'm sure that it will depend on the shape and
placement of the air dam.  I understand that the whaletail spoiler on many
911s provides considerable downforce at normal highway speeds.  Many cars
in the 70s received small add-on air dams to improve highway stability.

When the subject of highway stability was addressed here a year or two ago,
a list member from the UK (sorry, I can't remember the name) commented that
an aftermarket air dam on his Bus had a positive effect.

Is anyone here familiar enough with aerodynamics to give some advice on
what might be an effective design?
