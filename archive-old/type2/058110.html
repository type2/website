Subject: Side Vent Window Seals

	I'd like to get those new side window seals from Bus Depot but my side
vent seals are too shot to reuse.  Guess I'm going to put in a couple of
fixed wide windows and a louvered until these become available.  Were
sliders made for the 68-79 side windows and are these seals available if I
find a sliding unit?
