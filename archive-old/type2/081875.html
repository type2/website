Subject: [T2] RE: living in my bus &amp; follow up on window seal

i hate this thread. there, i said it &amp; i feel better.  &amp; actually my post
has nothing to do with it.

all i want to add is that i think Rob was trying to say &quot;guests &amp; fish start
to stink after 3 days&quot;, or something to that effect.

there can be a very fine line between someone who has had a run of bad
luck/needs help &amp; someone who is just a plain leech.  sometimes its hard to
make a distinction between the two.

[OBC]
i never posted a follow up about my rear window seal.  well, it went right
in on the first try after i got a 3rd helper.  we needed 2 people to hold
the glass from the outside &amp; apply pressure.  took all of 10 minutes.
