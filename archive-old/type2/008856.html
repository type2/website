This is the fuel outlet.  It should be loose if the nut thing is off. 
Try using a wood chisel (gently) to wedge it away from the thick
washer that separates the outlet from the tank.

&gt; I'm assuming the screen is 
&gt; attached to this,

Nope, but there might have been some sealant applied sometime.

Once you remove the tube, that thick washer on the threaded inlet is
attached to the screen.  You might use a wood chisel gently to unstick
the washer from the tank, then pull the screen out gently.  Shouldn't
be too hard once you get the washer unstuck.
