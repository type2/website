Subject: Bus Insulation

Thought I'd add my 2 pennies worth to the thread.

The problem with insulating vs moisture condensation is that you need to
seal one side of the other of the insulation to lessen the mixture of
cold/warm (barely warm for a bus) air to prevent/lessen condensation.

Think about house insulation.  There is a foil wrap on the side that goes
inside of the house, this foil overlaps and attaches the insulation to the
studs, creating a seal.  A house wrap (plastic sheeting that covers the
house before attaching siding or brick) does this from the outside.  (though
the main purpose of house wrap is to seal uninsulated cracks and window
joints)  Storm windows insulate window glass by the same concept,
neutralizing the temperture of the air, since insulation is just trapped
airspace anyway.

Also, if you've ever taken apart a door of any American vehicle made in the
last 30 or so years, there is thick plastic sheeting stuck very well to the
inside of the door panel, and foam insulation stuck to the body panel.

SO-insulation stuck in nooks and crannies (what in the h**l is a cranny?)
will still allow warm air and cold air to mix-and it acts like a sponge.
Insulation in bags allow air to creep around them, causing moisture, just
loses the sponge effect of loose insulation.  Spray foam probably does
somewhat better of a job, since its so dense, but still allows moisture to
form in voids.

3M glue or duct tape and 1.5 to 3 mil plastic sheeting, stuck to the sides
of the openings in the inside metal panels (under vinyl/cardboard body
panels) should go a long way to help prevent moisture, and will work as an
insulator itself.  Even the 1/4&quot; foam I saw (I think in Blue's photos) would
work much better with the interior of the vehicle sealed off, as would the
insulation in bags. There will still probably be some condensation-probably
why the VW engineers didn't worry so much about insulating a vehicle
supposed to last a lifetime-but nowhere as much, probably not much more than
with no insulation at all.

Just my thoughts,

                                                            Frank Stroupe
