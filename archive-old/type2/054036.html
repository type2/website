Subject: Maintaining lifter order

Volks, 

A competely different issue than the previous post... I am rebuilding a
1500cc SP engine and I am curious....  I would like to do a post-mortem on
the case as I disassemble it.  Usually, I just release the case
fasteners, tip the case up on one side and lift the upper half off...  the
lifters drop and you don't care because you are replacing them anyway.  I
would love to maintain the proper orientation of the lifter for this
post-mortem, tho, even tho I still have no intention of re-using them.
Has anyone tried to do this?  Succeeded?  I think if it tried to pull the
case apart while it was flat, the crank would drop onto the cam shaft...
While I intend to replace the camshaft, I hope to re-use the crank and
don't want to drop it on anything.
