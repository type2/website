Subject: RE:cleaning poptops

Dale and List,

The little flecks of black crud on the westy top that refuse to come
off no matter how hard you scrub (and make the top look gray) are not
dirt, it's mildew. That's why it won't come clean with regular soap
and water.

I use either Tylex or X-14 (they're about the same thing), they're
available in your grocery stores bathroom cleaning aisle. Buy 2
bottles and a soft scrub brush.

I spray one area at a time and let it sit for a minute, then alternate
between scrub/spray/rinse until it's clean. The whole job shouldn't
take more than an hour.


Jaime
