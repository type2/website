Subject: Re: [T2] Tanny mount sealing rings

Mike -
 It appears VW discontinued those nylon seals a very long time ago, as well
as the bushings in 1 piece form which according the 1973 dated OE VW Parts
fiche were only used in 1972. The new replacement bushings (2 per side) are
flanged I guess to act in place of the &quot;seals&quot;, at least that's how they
look in the OE VW Parts Fiche dated 1983.
 Looking further at my 1973 dated Parts Fiche and it shows they are
superseded to the 2 piece bushing, solving that mystery.
 211 599 435 A Bushing, Trans Mount Bolt.
 Amazingly enough, they're still available from VW _at_ $3.77 each
 And on a final note, the photo in Bentley is dated 1974, making no
reference that # 5 &amp; 6 are superseded for both the 1972 and the later
transmissions.

&gt; Greetings,
&gt; In the process of de-gunking the trans out of my 72, I dislodged some
&gt; nylon looking rings. They came from the sleeves that the trans carrier
bolts
&gt; go through. According to Bentley, ch.6 p.12, Fig 4.1 #5, they are sealing
&gt; rings. What exactly are they supposed to seal? How critical are they? Does
&gt; anyone out there happen to know a part number for said rings?
&gt; TIA
