Hey David,
I think your problem is not that strange.
An old mechanical DC-generator - regulator is switching D+ between Batterie
+ and Chassis (ground).
The bulb ist powered, as you wrote by switched Batterie + and then fed back
to the regulator where it is switched to ground ( high generator voltage),
light on, or batterie + (high generator  voltage), light off because of no
delta Voltage on bulb.

I think you have a more powerful  AC-alternator with elctronical regulator.
It nearly works the same, but - there is no hard switching between + and
gnd, it's done the electronic way - and only if the bulb is in the current
line.
Without bulb no 14 V or gnd and no alternator start. The magnetic &quot;Remanenz&quot;
(don't know the english expression) of a an alternator is very very low
compared
to a generator.
It needs a little current, making an magnetic field to start the show. No
bulb, no current, no magnetic field, no voltage from the alternator. Thats
also the
reason, why cou can't push-start a car with alternator when the batterie is
completely empty. A generator only needs one turn and it's working again.

Your problem seems to be easy:
You do supply the bulb from the center of your 2 batteries, that means you
have switched
+6 Volt fix fitted to the bulb. The other side is now electronical switched
from the regulator to gnd (engine off - light on with 6V).
Turn on engine and the regulator switches its side to 14 V. The other
terminal of the bulb is still where it was  6 V. Difference 14V- 6 V = 8 V,
that means brighter shinig when engine is on that
it was when engine was off - but again bulb on.

A problem could be, that you have alwas that 8V driven Bulb current telling
the alternator something wrong
when the engine is running. I think, it's always arranging a little magnetic
field, that forces the alternator to make voltage (and current),
that the regulator would not want to be
produced, even when the batterie is completely
loaded, because the regulator cannot switch off this current as it can
normally do with its Field (DF) terminal.
But I'm not shure how much this will confuse the sytem.

What you could do now is feeding a switched 12 V Batterie Voltage to the
bulb.
But be extremely careful, I think, I remember, that the oil- and the
Gen-bulbs are both connected to the same
switched batterie voltage directly in the speedo- unit, even the indicator
lamp is.
So it maybe better to install an extra, dual pin insulated control-bulb for
your generator, powered with switched
12V from a relais that is controled by your switched 6V. A little awkward.

Or stop - a diode could help. A standard 1 A diode could do the job.
Switched in the line from bulb to
D+, Anode connected to bulb, cathode to D+ . Now current can flow from +6V
via bulb to gnd (engine off), but no longer the other way: +12V via bulb to
6V,
because then voltage on cathode is bigger than on anode.

Or you convert the whole car to 12 V. Real light, wow. I know about the
problems, don't flame me...

Hope this helps,
best wishes,

58 split  6V, called &quot;Die Blindschleiche&quot; (slowworm)
77 westy - bright light.




&gt;Left the alternator, and wired it to two 6 volt batteries, in series.
&gt;This lets the bus run on 6v, but gives me access to 12v when I need it.

&gt;Alt B+ connects to the positive terminal of the first battery, neg
&gt;terminal of the first battery connects to the positive terminal of the
&gt;second battery.  Second negative goes to ground.  Bus runs off of the
&gt;second positive.  simple.

&gt;Alt D+ connects to the wire that runs from the gen. light.

&gt;Gen light functions (normally) like so.  Switched 6v feeds into the bulb,
&gt;then a wire runs from the bulb, to the regulator.  The regulator grounds
&gt;&lt;the wire when it is not producing electricity, lifts the ground when it
&gt;is.

&gt;Now, what's the trouble, you ask?

&gt;Everything intalled and functioning properly (yes, we everything is
&gt;charging correctly).  Key on, gen light comes on, just like before (half
&gt;as bright as the oil light, but it's been that way since I got the bus. I
&gt;suspected a corroded bulb base..).

&gt;Crank the bus, and the oil light goes out. Gen light gets brighter though!
&gt;And stays that way.  &quot;normal&quot; brightness (ie, like the oil light).

&gt;Wierd.

&gt;Again, everything is functioning (except the light..) perfectly.
&gt;Everything is charging as it should.

&gt;So.

&gt;I check the bulb, turns out to be a 12v bulb.  That explains why it was
&gt;dim.

&gt;Check all the connections, and they are fine.  Pull the plug from the alt,
&gt;and sure enough, the light goes out.

&gt;Now.

&gt;With the D+ wire DISCONNECTED when the engine is started, and during this
&gt;test, the D+ remains with no voltage.

&gt;Engine still running, apply the wire from the light, blip the throttle,
&gt;and remove the wire.  There is now a steady 13.98 volts at D+

&gt;If you start the engine with the wire attached, it immediatly starts
&gt;producing ~14 volts at D+.  Test .while. wire attached still shows 13.98,
&gt;as well as with the wire off.

&gt;Something else I noticed that is making no sense...There is never
&gt;continuity from D+ to ground. Under any circumstance.  At least, it wont
&gt;set off the beep on my multimeter's continuity checker.  I have not
&gt;checked for exact resistance, though.
---
theorys.....

&gt;The light goes to normal brightness due to the 14 volts coming from D+,
&gt;which is then looping back through the 6v system, and find some sort of
&gt;ground.  No other systems are affected by this.  Nothing runs fast,
&gt;nothing shines brighter.

&gt;Also, I suspect that somehow the 6v from the light is .triggering. the 14v
&gt;from D+, somehow feeding it enough to get it started.  A jump start.

&gt;Now, do I have a question? Sure. WHY THE HELL IS THIS happening?!?:(

&gt;I have not yet checked this D+ behavior against a normal running AL82X
&gt;that a friend has.  I will tomorrow.
