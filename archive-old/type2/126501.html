Subject: Re: [T2] Frequent Frustration with a Reluctant Relay

The headlights on my 73 route through the hazard switch. I'd bet that
it's the same with your 69.

The switch assembly had come apart, the plastic tabs were broken. I
stripped it, cleaned it, re-lubed it, and put it together with a zip
tie.

Picture isn't too clear. I didn't think to snap any pics during the process...
