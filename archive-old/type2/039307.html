&gt; It appears that I unknowingly filled my transmission with Amalie GL5.

&gt; 
&gt; Does the GL5 cause weakness in the metal, something like metal fatigue? OR
&gt; 
&gt; Does it just cause premature wear, due to improper lubrication?

It causes corrosion of the brass synchros.

&gt; Am I safe in just draining it and adding GL4 Hypoid Gear Oil?

this would be the best alternative.  Whatever damage has been done will
stop when you replace the oil.  Don't let things you can't change worry
you!
