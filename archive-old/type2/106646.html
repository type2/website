&gt;Hey guys,
&gt;
&gt;         Another quick question... one of the hinges on my &quot;new&quot; Bus is
&gt;busted. The little rod that goes through the hinge seems to have snapped.
&gt;What's the easiest way to repair this? Do I hammer the old one out, and
&gt;slide a metal dowell in there?

Yes. Grind or file off the ends of the rod and knock them out with a pin 
punch. Penetrating oil is advised. Cotter pin of the right size is a quick 
replacement, though stainless would be good to prevent rust.
