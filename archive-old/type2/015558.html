Sounds like someone put them in dry. It could be hard anti-seize from the
PO who quit using anti-seize when it got hard to turn them back in, so then
he started putting them in dry.

Use stock Bosch Super plugs. Use 2 to 3 drops of light machine oil on the
threads. Replace them every 10k/2 years if you have stock points ignition
or clean and reuse for the later high energy ignitions for up to 20k.

This procedure has served me perfectly in the maintenance of all the
aluminum heads on all the many BMW, VW, Audi, Porsche, Mercedes, Volvo,
Saab, Jaguar, Land Rover and et al Euro engines I service year in and year
out. Over and over on any plug I have prior installed, pop it loose, run it
out quickly with the fingers, 2 or 3 drops of oil, run it back to the seat
with fingers, torque to spec via guage or feel with skill.

If any thread will not allow the clean and lubed plug to be turned to the
seat without a wrench, chase the threads with an quality spark plug
rethreader available at your FLAPS. Pack the tap with heavy grease to trap
the residue so it won't fall into the cylinder. Get a quality brand name
tool. 

With anit seize, I would expect every other removal will require chasing
the threads to get the hardened crud out of there. But that's only if you
use it wisely re:sparingly. If like too many you goop them up good, then
leave them too danged long, you'll be doing a lot of thread
chasing/drilling/tapping/$$$$$$$$.

A few drops of 3-in-1 oil is the most servicable method for proper spark
plug thread maintenance for the long term.

&gt;I've taken spark plugs out of my heads and found a considerable amount of
&gt;aluminum in the spark plug threads before I started using anit seize.
