Subject: Looking for a good engine, time for action

Hello List,

Well, I am in need of a GOOD used engine. I made a
reality check today. I made a list of the expenses
that I would have and the time it would take to get my
bus back on the road. I am a college student who
currently lives with his parrents. I plan to be moving
out within the year and I must have the bus drivable
before I move or it will have to be junked. I planed
to purchase an AVP engine but that will put me over my
time and money budget. I am looking for a GOOD, 2L ( I
am also open to 1.7L or 1.8L)engine that doesn't leak
or burn oil, is complete with FI, and doesn't have
high miles (150,000&lt;).  The only catch is that you
must be no more than 200-300 miles away. That will
allow me to make a one day trip. I live in Wilmington,
NC. I wanted to try the list first before I went to my
local vw scrap yard because they generally don't know
much about the engines in their old buses. 

If any one can help me I would really appreciate it. I
have had my idle bus for too long. it is time to bring
it back to life. Thanks in advance!
