Subject: headlight switch dimmers

the secret to these suckers is just ripping out the rheostat, and bridging
the circuit with a resistor... i can't remember what value my electronics
friend used, but it gave a brightness roughly halfway between off and full.
not adjustable, of course, but you could try different resistors till you
find a brightness you like.


i took 4 switches apart to make 1 working one, rheostat and all. when it
goes, i put in another resistor :P
