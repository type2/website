Subject: license light question, rust removal

Well, last night I resolved the problem, sort of.  I wound up resorting to
the dremel and stone to remove the corrosion inside the collar.  After
polishing it bright and the connector tab bright, I still got no light, so I
connected the VOM from the tab to the collar.... 8 meg of resistance between
the tab and the collar!!!!    I think that enough rust has built up in the
pressed joint that it's nearly perfectly insulated.  I've ordered a
replacement from Bus Depot.  Bummer.  I might try disassembling the fixture,
but the lens is pretty sad, so it's probably not worth it.

In answer to Ken's question, I was presuming bronze because it's a bit of a
spring.  Brass doesn't harden worth a damn, whereas bronze will.  Who
knows?    Anyway, he's correct on the electronegativity front, so my idea
would not have worked.

Steve
