&gt;Hi, just wondering if there is a trick or something in sliding the push rod
&gt;tubes on a 2 L Type 4 engine.   There is that sharp edge there, not 
&gt;tapered on the
&gt;head. .... that edge was catching it and difficult to push in.

I use a triangular scraper to shave off those sharp edges, then while 
installing, use a very small screwdriver to work around the seal, tucking 
it in. Use no sealant on those o-rings, just some light oil. Silicone 
grease would also be ok. They have to move without binding due to heat 
expansion.
