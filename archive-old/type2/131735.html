&gt;From: &quot;Karl&quot;

&gt;Speaking of Terry.......
&gt;Whatever happened with that paint-a-bunch-of-buses get together?
&gt;I have not heard any more about it.


I think Terry might have gotten a little overwhelmed with the amount of 
responses and the potential amount of &quot;babysitting&quot;. I am still all for it 
as soon as I get my bus on the road.
