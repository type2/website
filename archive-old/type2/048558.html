Well, since the bay buses lack the frame horns that support the back end
of the transmission, without the rear mount the engine falls to the
ground!.  Later bays do have supports for the aft end of the transmission,
but I don't think they were designed to support a cantalevered engine like
the frame horns were.  Better to stick with the stock configuration, as it
minimizes stresses and spreads them out over a greater part of the buses'
structure.
