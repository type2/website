Subject: Brakes and stuff

Hey guys,

    Well, I spent some time under my 73 Bus today and noticed that the braking
components all seem to be leaking fluid slowly from somewhere.
The master cyl is rusty, and is clearly the original. The body steel lines
don't appear to be too bad, and the caliper to body lines are brand new
(rubber). but the lines from the rubber lines to the caliper itself are pitted
and look like they could fail any day. The fabric line that goes from the
booster to the engine also looks really old and looks original (looks like my
old original fuel line did before I replaced it).

My calipers are also very rusty.

I noticed that the Bus Depot has everything I need... but I was wondering if
you guys knew whether or not I could get aluminum calipers? I'd rather have
aluminum as it dissipates heat a bit better, and I don't have to paint them. I
suppose if I don't have an alternative, then I could just paint them.
Anyway, just thought I would ask before I spent money.


Thanks!

Todd
