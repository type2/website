Wow, so strange to see a Type 4 engine without those FI intake runners  
:-)

&gt; Just thought I'd share. Every vacuum connection is blocked off with  
&gt; those pretty colored caps. The bright red wires are the new wiring I  
&gt; put in to replace the rotted old wiring (which was, oddly, black).

Black seems to be a pretty common +12 wire in VWs.  Brown has been the  
color for ground on every air-cooled VW I can remember having worked  
on.

&gt; There are some pics of the bad points too... I had just used a bit of  
&gt; motor oil on the rubbing block on the last set of points. I'd  
&gt; forgotten about that until Karl reminded me. So the block failure is  
&gt; my fault. On the new ones I dabbed some plain lithium grease on the  
&gt; block and the shaft to keep it safe. Kragen auto said they don't carry  
&gt; &quot;points grease&quot; anymore, but said I could use the dielectric grease I  
&gt; use for rubber and plastic connectors and boots.
&gt;
&gt; Any recommendations?

You can order points grease from aircooled_dot_net
