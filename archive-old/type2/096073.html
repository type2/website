&gt; Quoth George Lyle:  The correct size is 185R14. With no center number,
&gt; &gt; &gt; Your better choice would have been 195/75......
&gt; Quoth Bob (Acess Systems) : or as I have 205/70
&gt; 
&gt; In reference to using 205/70, this is the least tall tire- I get the
&gt; following measurements: STANDARD=0.82X185= 151.7mm sidewall height from
&gt; rim.  195/75 is 195X0.75 =146.25mm and 205/70 is 143.5mm.    Now I gotta

but the actual tire diameter is 25.7 for the 185's  and only 25.3 for the
205/70s    the 205 only makes 11 more revolutions per mile.
