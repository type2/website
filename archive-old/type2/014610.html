You might be right, but I don't recall GFI's in common use in 1971. 
It may just be a resetable circuit breaker.  If it were a GFI, it
should also have a test button.

&gt;Bryan,
&gt;
&gt;If you have a reset button on the outlet, that usually means you 
&gt;have a
&gt;GFI outlet(Ground Fault Interruptor).  This is what saves you when 
&gt;you
&gt;drop your hiar dryer in the tub with you.
&gt;
&gt;It could be bad(I've seen them go bad), but it is probably busy 
&gt;saving you
&gt;from electrocuting yourself.
&gt;
&gt;Plug the tv in somwhere else and see if it works.  Unplug the 
&gt;extension
&gt;cord and plug something simple in to the outlet and see if it works.
&gt;
&gt;Cheers, dave
&gt;

&gt;&gt; &gt; I recently purchased a '71 Westy 2 weeks ago so its
&gt;&gt; &gt; been sitting in my driveway while I get it road
&gt;&gt; ready.
&gt;&gt; &gt; I have the extension cord running to it so I could
&gt;&gt; &gt; have my 9&quot; t.v. out there so I could watch the news
&gt;&gt; &gt; while working on it. It's been working great until
&gt;&gt; &gt; last night when I unplugged it to move it. I plugged
&gt;&gt; &gt; it back in and had no juice. First I checked the
&gt;&gt; &gt; extension cord--it was plugged in and was giving
&gt;&gt; &gt; power.
&gt;&gt; &gt; I then hit the reset button on the outlet--it
&gt;&gt; clicked
&gt;&gt; &gt; but I am still not getting any power. Does anybody
&gt;&gt; &gt; know what happened or what to check??
&gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt; Thanks,
&gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt; BK
