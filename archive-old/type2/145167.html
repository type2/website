I'd be pretty warry if I were you Bob about all the wiring and other
assorted things behind the dash. If you weld the lower lip in with all
that stuff still hanging around, one stray piece of slag could melt
some insulation off a wire good enough to do some damage. I do wonder
if some of the Bonding Adhesives might work well with this sort of
repair? 3M Automix Panel Bonding Adhesive is one if the possibles.
