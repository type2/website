&gt; &gt; (1) When accelerator is fully pressed to the floor or mostly there, a
&gt; &gt; rattling sound seems to be coming from the engine.  Closest I can compare
&gt; &gt; it to is a piece of plastic in a dryer. If I let off the gas pedal a bit,
&gt; &gt; it goes away (or at least it's low enough that I can't hear the rattling
&gt; &gt; any more).
&gt;
&gt;This sounds like it could be pinging ie preignition. Very bad for a vw
&gt;engine if it is. Check the timing to make sure its not too advanced.
&gt;Good place to start anyway.

Hmmm... This brings up a good point. I know there had been a problem with 
the advance tube leading to the carb.  I'll look into that...

&gt; &gt; (2)  Primarily when the vehicle has been driven around a bit (most likely
&gt; &gt; translates to --&gt; when engine gets hot), there is a definite clicking
&gt; &gt; sound.  I had a friend listen to it and he said it sounded like it was
&gt; &gt; coming from #1 or there was something up with my exhaust system.  Bah.  I'm
&gt; &gt; going to play with it a bit in my driveway once it cools down a bit so I
&gt; &gt; don't get too fried out there, but I have yet to get a definite answer on
&gt; &gt; what this might be -- except that a friend said he could take apart my
&gt; &gt; entire engine and *hopefully* figure it out.  Hehe.
&gt;
&gt;Well I would check the valve adjustment first.
&gt;
&gt;What engine? year?  solid or hydraulic lifters? carb/FI? distributor?

I'm quite a novice when it comes to all of this.  All I know for sure is 
that it's an 1800 Porsche engine and it's not fuel-injected.  Beyond that, 
I don't have much info for you.
