Subject: Re; New pistons


    My experience is with 2.0 air-cooled engines is limited to stock
displacements, fuel injection and stock valves sizes. I would be hard
pressed to change my ways because of the expectations that go with non stock
engine configurations.
    We tend to paint with a broad brush when we get into this conversation
of compression ratios. It is not one factor but many that contribute to the
engines oil and head temps. In New England on a cool fall day it can take 45
minutes for the oil temp in my air-cooled vanagon to level off. Compression
ratios do affect engine temps as does load, varying fuel air ratios on some
carbs at different throttle positions, air temps, fan intake temps, timing,
RPM, the amount of time the engine is run and camshaft design.
    I believe that VW used the stock cam design to warm the air-cooled
engine up as fast as possible. The air-cooled engine needs all the help it
can get to warm up on a cool day when the load is light and the time driven
is short to prevent the fuel from accumulating in the oil. The way the stock
cam does this is with low exhaust valve lift aprox .240 ths at the cam  This
keeps some of the hot gases in the head. Using a high lift cam drops the
heads temps because there is no end gases left in the head this can be a
problem for two reasons first is warm up time in the cooler climates as
stated above takes longer and lower head temps don't always mean lower
piston and oil temps.
    The use of external coolers with a thermostat is a good idea but does
not always solve the common problem air-cooled busses and vans share that is
to high a load for to small an engine with fuel that is not made to run in
air-cooled engines. I find myself telling customers that the air-cooled
engines have limits and those limits drop as the ambient temp goes up and
are over all lower than the good old days due to the fuels available
