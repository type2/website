Subject: RE: [T2] Row cow gives birth!

Saw it myself about a year and a half ago, same location, and no, I
don't believe that it runs. Upon closer inspection, it fell a victim to
bad fuel lines, and all of the wiring in the engine compartment was
melted into a big mess. 

Christopher 




does anyone know if it actually runs?
