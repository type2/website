&gt; &gt; Do I have to stick to the 185's or can I put a set of 195 lt's on it?
&gt; You can run 195s, though 185s are the preferred size
&gt;
&gt; Stock is 185R14.  Since there is no section ratio, it defaults to 80 or
&gt; 82.  You can run a load range C in this size.
&gt;
I run 205/70R14

since this is a 70 aspect ratio it is almost exactly the same diameter as
the 185/82 tire howeverr it is considerably wider and (I think) gives a
much more stable ride.  mine are michelins and are load range 99S (which
is &quot;D&quot; I think, it is well over the weight range)  however these tires are
very hard to find and are quite pricy, mine were about $125 each on the
bus.  but I think they are well worth the price
