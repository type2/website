About the LED's...

This may be of some use, Idon't know... but at work, we just got one of those 
message boards that you see on the highway... it uses these LED clusters, 12 
volt, that the manufacturer gets from Hewlett Packard.  They are (supposedly) 
the brightest ones available - and from what I've seen, I have no reason to 
doubt it.  They are amber, but I figure if they're bright enough... the 
clusters are brighter than the old bulb type boards we used to use.

They have a rated life guarantee of 10,000 hours.  That'd be 12 years or so 
at 24 hrs a day.  

Also, they may have clear ones.  Then again, I used these little halogen 
bulbs I got from work in the bug, and they worked really good!  I would write 
HP and ask them.
