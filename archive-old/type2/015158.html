I am looking for the L codes, I am a big bug fan and have a few of them but
I now have a bus and I think I have found the L Codes. Are they the numbers
in the middle of the plate behind the passengers seat? I thin they are and
if they are then they would be
426  081  082  114
I have a 64 standard, but which one of the numbers are which? I have the
meaning of the codes but I can only find one that matches and that is 081
and it means como green.
Any ideas about the other numbers or any info as to whether I am right or not!
Thanks 
Shane Hood
