Subject: [T2] Need advice - parts maybe.

Ok.

I had a great meeting with Karl (last name escapes me) yesterday evening.
Super guy, really nice and patient.  Man does that guy know a ton about
busses.  Eesh.  I got all the info I need, and he was nice enough to help me
with a few hard to find parts - gratis.

Know I know I need to do a good tune-up, replace some needed parts (I got
the heater tubes - thanks Karl) and get a kind of focus for my clean-up.

I'm leaning toward putting together a weekender, and so I'm wondering if
this will be cost prohibitive.  I know I don't want to fool with the
pop-top, but I do want the interior accoutrements.

I saw a complete 76 (I think) Westy with the pop top and most of the
interior pieces, but it was pretty trashed.

So I guess I need a advice or parts.

I really don't care about the cushion colors, I can have those recovered.

thanks.
