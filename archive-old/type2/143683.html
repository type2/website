Subject: Re: [T2] valves

&gt; Beware the aluminum pulleys with degree wheels on them. Are light and provide no dampening effects for crank vibrations. Maybe a big deal based on what I have read from a few sources. I know in other air cooled engines it is critical enough to prevent a broken crank. Dunno if that is an issue in the short VW 4 banger. Might just effect longevity of the crank bearings???

i dont think there is much weight difference between the stock steel
pulley and the aluminum degree pulleys.
especially compared to the weight of the flywheel.
