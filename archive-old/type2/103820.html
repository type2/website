Subject: [T2] Mexican Distributor?

Hello Listees,

Does anyone have any info on the '034' Bosch SVDA distributor which seems to 
be available from one of our favorite auction sites?  I wrote the seller and 
he expressed that these were brand-new Bosch dizzys that are used in the 
Mexican/Brazillian 1600 upright engines.  I'm thinking of trying one out, 
but I don't really know much about the timing curve.  Anyone?  TIA.

Eron
