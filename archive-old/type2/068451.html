Subject: Hall Ignition Stuff Buying Guide

Spent yesterday diagnosing that I probably needed the Hall Control 
Unit replaced on my '80 CA Westi.  Interesting pricing differences.
The following are actual rounded off quoted prices for the HCU, also 
known as a Fairchild unit (inventor of the unit):
$400, but lists at $700
$158
$98
$58
Interesting that everybody except the last had a hard time 
understanding WHAT part I was talking about.  All of these shops 
either specialize in VW stuff, or are import specialists.  The last 
one, at $58, also had it on the shelf, so didn't have to order it. 
I'm not too dumb,I bought the $58 one.  They also had the 12 point 
internal spline CV tool for $3.50 also.

This is a local shop in Grass Valley, not a chain, not a mail order 
place, but I'm sure that would send you parts if you asked.  If 
anyone wants more info let me know, &amp; I'll post after checking with them.

So, IF you ever need Hall ignition stuff, really, really, really call 
around for pricing and availability, it WILL save you lots of dollars.
