&gt; Ahh the fabled &quot;Woodruff key&quot; - what is it ? All the books mention it
&gt; without saying what it looks like and how you unlock(pun intended) it.

See: http://www.engineersedge_dot_com/woodruff_keys.htm

A cutter is used to cut a semi-circular keyway into the shaft, a broach is
used to cut a rebate into the pulley, then the key is slipped into the
notch and the pulley is slid onto the shaft such that the rebate engages
the part of the key that protrudes from the shaft.

Woodruff keys are usually used on straight shafts not tapered but &quot;never
say never.&quot;

&gt; It may be that the alternator needs re-building (read chucking away and
&gt; replacing) but since it is still generating the requisite amount of
&gt; electricity and is otherwise fine I hope not. The squeaky noise coming from
&gt; it is worse on hot days or if I spray WD40 behind the pulley so I suspect
&gt; the front bearing just needs proper lubrication. Whatever it needs though,
&gt; that pulley has to come off !

By the time a bearing is making noise it usually needs replacement though
having a go at greasing it costs nothing and may work, at least for a bit.
Buying a rebuilt generator/alternator is usually cheaper than rebuilding
it yourself unless you are a machinist and already have the bearings and
press.  If you decide to replace do not chuck the old one as there will
probably be a core charge.

                             OOK!
