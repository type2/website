Subject: Re: What are &quot;Deadhead stickers&quot;?

&gt;&gt; Jean Baptiste Le Pesant asks &quot;What are &quot;Deadhead&quot; stickers&quot;?
&gt;
&gt;Chris' definition that deadhead stickers have to do with a busses
&gt;impending death, the more, the closer to death, is simply wrong.  
&gt;
&gt;The term &quot;Deadhead&quot; has been used by cross-country truckers since the
&gt;1930s to denote driving their rigs from one point to another with no cargo
&gt;to pay the way.  A &quot;Deadhead&quot; sticker in modern etymological parlance
&gt;signifies that the driver of the VW bus has made at least one such
&gt;cargoless trip from one point to another with conscious intent.  The
&gt;subcultural clue here is &quot;conscious intent&quot;.  It speaks of a way of life
&gt;where the &quot;process&quot; of driving is more important than its &quot;content&quot;, and a
&gt;&quot;Deadhead sticker&quot; is a way of signalling this consciousness.  The VW bus
&gt;is chosen vehicle for those who are conscious, realized by only a few,
&gt;understood by even fewer, and the &quot;Deadhead&quot; Sticker their overt
&gt;acknowledgement of their status...

   To Jean-Luis : these guys are shining you on. It is good shine
 but still glows in the dark.

 These are the guys who wear &quot;NO FEAR&quot; t-shirts.

 Not to worry, they will learn fear.

 They are poking sticks at one of the &quot;VW Spirits&quot; and some Dark and
Doomy Night it will come to haunt them. 

 I'm not the one to tell the real story but I'm sure there is one among us
who can do it well.          west
