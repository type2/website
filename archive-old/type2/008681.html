&gt; There's a tool for removing (and presumably re-installing) that
honkin 
&gt; big nut on the rear wheel that is about 1/2&quot; thick, and about 8&quot;
long, 
&gt; which allows you to hammer like h*ll on it to get the nut off...
&gt; 
&gt; My question is, how do you know how to re-torque the sucker when you
are 
&gt; putting it back on?  Hammering the h*ll out of it doesn't show up in
any 
&gt; of my manuals as a torque setting.

Well, there's no doubt that the &quot;dogbone wrenches&quot; work when it comes
to getting the big nut off, but I'm leery of the damage that can be
done to the bearings in the process.  I'd avoid them is possible.

To get the proper torque, all you need is a proper 3/4 inch drive
socket (46mm or 1-13/16) and a slide bar.  Divide 253 by your weight
in pounds and multiply by 12.  Measure this distance in inches along
the handle of the slide bar from the square drive and mark with tape. 
Put the slide bar on the nut with the handle pointing horizontally to
the right.  Stand on the mark and the nut will be torqued perfectly. 
Now move the nut to line up the nearest castellations (there are two
holes in the axle, so you'll only have to move the nut a maximum of
1/4 of a castallation for it to line up.  Put in a fresh cotter pin
and you're done.

Next time you need to take the nut off, you'll have the proper wrench.
 The wrench will also make you popular with your bus-owning friends
and is useful for discouraging door-to-door evangelists. :)
