You may need to adjust the angle or bend of the bowden tube. This is
covered in Bentley...

&gt;The bad news- I replaced the cable with a new one I've had in the Westy

All I can say is that every clutch cable I've used on my '73 (well, that's
only two) was the same way.  I double-checked the part number too.  I guess

it's no big deal since using every last thread seems to allow the proper
adjustment, but it is tiring turning that wing nut off and on that far.
