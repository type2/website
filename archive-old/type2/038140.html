Subject: Re: Engine movement

Yeah, that's what mine was doing, and looking at it, I couldn't figure
out why it shook so much, but when I took the engine out, I found out
about the two bolts holding the transmission up.  See, the engine also is
'mounted' by being bolted into the transmission, just like that's the
only mount for type I style engines.  Anyway, the transmission wasn't
bolted at all, and therefore that end of the engine and the transmission
were basically just hanging, therefore an insane amount of shaking. 
Check it out if you haven't, they aren't difficult at all to put bolts in
there.  Just gotta jack it up some and line it up, but it took me like 15
minutes.

&gt; My engine seems to shake more than normal.
&gt; I was told by a mechanic that I should replace the engine mounts
&gt; but it was no hurry he said.
&gt; They wanted $350 bucks for the job!!!!
&gt; The rubber mounts on the mounting bar are the only mounts I
&gt; could visibly see, and they -seemed- ok.
&gt; Any places to look for problems or suggestions?
