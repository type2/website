one thing to consider is when you put in a temp gauge...you usually have to
take out the rubber boot that seals the temp. sending wire......by taking this
out you have a hole in your cooling tin.  gene berg enterprises sells a real
slick temp sending unit for about 10 bucks that goes in the dipstick
hole.......i have one in everyone of my aircooleds and they work great.!!!!!!
ona further side note you might consider running some synthetic oil in the
summer ( or any season for that matter)...oil temps drop, gas mileage goes up
and a whole list of other good things happen when changing to a quality moter
oil........
