Hi Folks,

Just a quick note here.  The Tour-de-Sol (a cross copuntry car race(?)
for electric cars) is in town for a few days.  Saw the support vehicle
pass me near the NY State Capitol.  Noted that it was a '77 or so bay
window bus with the words Tour-de-Sol Support painted on it's blue
sides.  It's news worthy because it is very rare to see a VW van of any
type on the road here much less a work vehicle.  Though you guys and
gals would be interested.
