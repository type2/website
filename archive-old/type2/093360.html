Subject: Re: [T2] Weber manifold problem?

This works well enough that when GM built the Corvair they used one carb on 
each side feeding 3 cylinders.

They placed the single carb between two cylinders so one cylinder wasn't 
getting most of mixture and the others running lean.

As a result the engine tuning is a BIG compromise.

You are tuning to make the leanest cylinders rich enough and simply wasting 
fuel in the other cylinders.

This is advantage of those fancy, 'spensive carbs. You can tune for each 
cylinder.

I THINK the idea here is that the fuel/air mix gets distributed based on 
vacuum - that is since each cylinder produces the same vacuum, each 
cylinder gets the same charge.

Also the last single carb conversion I saw had a hollow base that both dual 
runners ran to - - - that is to say that despite the visual offset of the 
carb, no harm is done.

You're carb is a progressive so that one throat is closed until you floor 
the gas pedal and this helps keep the fuel mileage reasonable.

I'd love to hear more from the list experts.

&gt;List,
&gt;Just before bed the other night, i was
&gt;contemplating my Weber DFEV and its manifold -
&gt;the kind for the type4 conversion. It sits
&gt;rebuilt on my dresser awaiting installation.
&gt;
&gt;I noticed something - perhaps a new shortcoming
&gt;of this setup.  The carb functions such that the
&gt;primary throttle barrel does most of the work;
&gt;the secondary only begins to open at maybe a
&gt;little  under half throttle - maybe more, maybe
&gt;less. Anyway, the manifold is designed in such
&gt;away that the barrels  of the carb line up over
&gt;the manifold ports that connect to the runners
&gt;that go to either cylinders 1&amp;3 or 2&amp;4.
&gt;
&gt;If the carb sits so that you're looking at the
&gt;main idle screw when you look into the engine
&gt;compartment (normal position), then the primary
&gt;throttle body sits in line with (over) the ports
&gt;for 2&amp;4.
&gt;
&gt;Now, i know all four cylinders should pull the
&gt;mixture at the same rate, but if the mixture
&gt;exits the carb directly over the ports for #2&amp;4
&gt;(a couple inches away from the ports for #1&amp;3), i
&gt;figure one of  two things may be happening:
&gt;1. #s 2&amp;4 are running rich
&gt;2. #s 1&amp;3 are running lean until the secondary
&gt;opens.
&gt;Now, my knowledge of fluid dynamics and flow is
&gt;very limited and it
&gt;may be that when the mixture hits the manifold,
&gt;it gets distributed
&gt;evenly, but it just doesn't seem that way. If
&gt;you hold a lit
&gt;cigarette behind two fans of equal strength but
&gt;a little closer to
&gt;one of the fans than the other, the smoke will
&gt;get sucked through the
&gt;fan it is closer to, correct?
&gt;
&gt;A solution to this would be a manifold that
&gt;looks more like a type1
&gt;manifold, where the mixture is joined into one
&gt;pipe after the carb
&gt;manifold and then split into the two ports at
&gt;the manifold on the
&gt;head.
&gt;
&gt;I saw one of these - for a type4 engine - on
&gt;ebay a while back but
&gt;haven't been able to find it since. I think
&gt;this kit had an IDF
&gt;sitting on it.
&gt;Installed on a bus, this intake system would
&gt;appear to have a solid
&gt;pipe (runner)on the right (from the carb
&gt;manifold to the head) and a
&gt;split runner on the left with a boot joining
&gt;the cut. Shiny, chrome
&gt;thing. Mighty purdy.
&gt;
&gt;Has anyone else seen these? Its probably a
&gt;porsche marketed part.
&gt;
&gt;Thanks for reading and, with all due respect,
&gt;please don't tell me to
&gt;go buy a set of duals or convert to FI. I just
&gt;don't have that kind
&gt;of money or time.

Ciao!
