&gt; &gt; &lt;&lt; timing is based on engine not distributor,  &gt;&gt;
&gt; 
&gt; This is the second time this week that that statement has been posted and
&gt; for the second time this week, I have serious heartburn over it.  I
&gt; disagree.  Respectfully, but strongly.

I think maybe we are thinking the same thing but saying it differently,
but if you look on pg 72 of the Engine chapter of Bentley it shows the
timing settings and each of them are based on engine codes

engine code             setting
  R                        0
  AE                       5 after
  CB single carb           5 after
  CB dual carb /AW         10 after
  CD/AW(fi)/ED             5 after
  ED                       5 after
  GD                       7.5 before

if you put the wrong dist on an engine you would still set the static
timing based on the engine installed.   now once engine is running you
would be best set it at best compromise to get sufficient advance.


&gt; 
&gt; TIMING IS BASED ON DISTRIBUTOR!!!!!!
&gt; 
&gt; The distributor controls all aspects of timing.  Where it starts, how fast
&gt; it advances, how far it advances.  The only sense in which engine makes
&gt; any difference in timing is maximum acceptable advance.  On a type1 block,
&gt; that is 27 degrees before top dead center (BTDC) at 3500RPM; on a type4
&gt; block, it is 32 degrees BTDC at 3500RPM.

we are saying the same thing, but the amount of advance and initial static
timing are based on the engine not what dizzy is in there....I have a GD
block with FI, even if I put a dizzy in there from an AW block I would
still set the initial static timing at 7.5 before rather than 10 after
TDC.  once the engine is running then I would use my timing light to get
the best operation

&gt; 
&gt; If you will point a browser at Jim Thompson's page of distributors
&gt; ( http://www.oldvolkshome_dot_com/ignition.htm ) you will find that the range
&gt; of timing specifications runs from 10 degrees BTDC to 10 degrees after top
&gt; dead center (ATDC). A quick survey of proper timing points indicates stops
&gt; at 10, 7.5, and 5 degrees BTDC; TDC; and 5 and 10 degrees ATDC.  6
&gt; different set points for distributors that go on one of two slightly
&gt; different engine designs!

I think we are saying the same thing, AFTER you get the engine running and
check and verify and adjust with a timing light,  especially my opinion is
that a type IV engine cannot be properly timed without a timing light to
check both start timing and proper ADVANCE for that BLOCK

 &gt; 
&gt; Let us say, for example, that you own a 1976 bus with an automatic
&gt; transmission, equipped with the original VW 021-905-205P distributor and
&gt; properly timed to 7.5 degrees BTDC. Let us further say that you live in
&gt; the middle Atlantic states and are determined to visit Memphis, TN.
&gt; Before you leave, you give it a tune up and note that the dwell is
&gt; hunting.  You pull the distributor and the shaft is wobbly... the bearings
&gt; are shot.  So you reach into your parts box and pull out a VW
&gt; 021-905-205AC (proper timing spec: 5 ATDC), also from a 1976 automatic
&gt; transmission bus.  Install it, set dwell, then set the timing to 7.5 BTDC
&gt; *as you always have*.  Then you head off for Memphis.  If you are very
&gt; lucky, your severely oveheated engine would die on you around Salem, VA,
&gt; so that you could have it towed to Mark Deering's shop to have the engine
&gt; rebuilt.
&gt; 
&gt; What changed in the above example?  the engine?  or the distributor?  Why
&gt; did the engine overheat?  Because the timing spec *for the distributor*
&gt; changed from 7.5 BTDC for the -205P distributor to 5 ATDC for the -205AC
&gt; and by ignoring that change, you have set the timing at 3500 RPMs to be
&gt; 12.5 degrees too far advanced!
