I heard from Brad today. Looks like the Queen City Bus Club is also going to
be at the campout. Full Mooners will be there as well.

Brad is working on some cool shirts so email me NOW if you what one. Now
means NOW. Include size and sweat or tee shirt. I used to do shirts but did
not have the time this year. It is a big pain, so do not wait around. No
guarantees there will be any at the event. docric_at_preferred_dot_com

Remember that we leave Sunday AM for the Farmington VW Drags/ show/ swap.

Click the Vanhoy name for directions, and do not forget to drive back and
downhill to find our area. It is hidden from view.
