Subject: Shakes with shifting

Hello all!

I've got a 79 Bus that when revved high, I can shift without having a
problem. But if I'm not revving high, it sounds/feels like the engine is
going to come out of the back of the bus. I know there arn't any engine
mounts since it connects right to the transaxle but could a transaxle
mount be bad? I found the one up at the front of the transaxle - looks
fine but didn't notice how the rest is connected. The clutch seems fine
and sometimes it's like there is no problem... but sometimes... it
sounds deadly back there... shake rattle and role!

Roy
