I believe Gene Berg in his tech writings states not to filter the suction
side of a pump.......makes sense.

Subject: [T2] type1 oil filters


&gt; Looking through an old CB Performance catalog last night I noticed they
had
&gt; several different filter options for the type1 engine.  I'm getting ready
to
&gt; rebuild an engine for my '68 crewcab and had bought a Berg relief oil pump
&gt; cover, planning on tapping the case, but these CB products don't require
&gt; case tapping.
&gt;
&gt; The first one replaces the oil strainer cover with a larger filter type
&gt; element.  Granted, it hangs down a little further, but supposedly it
filters
&gt; in place of the strainer screen.  Advantages would seem to be instant
&gt; filtering on an existing engine and no possible hose problems like with an
&gt; external filter.  Disadvantages anyone?
&gt;
&gt; The second item was a replacement oil pump with and inlet and outlet
already
&gt; tapped and installed.  Seems like you just run hoses to/from2 your
external
&gt; filter and your done.  Again, keeps you from a case tapping adventure.
&gt;
&gt; Anyone ever use these?  Danger or success stories appreciated.
&gt;
&gt; Thanks,
&gt; Dean
