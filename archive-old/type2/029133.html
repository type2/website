Hey Ric
I have found that _usually_ the source of an oil leak is the cleanest thing
in the engine room.  The oil flushes all the dirt and stuff off it and so
cleans the offending item.  Remember that your oil cooler sits in the
airstream from your fan and should have all kinds of gunk on it.  Especially
if there's oil mist present.  Remove the oil cooler and get it pressure
tested at the local radiator shop.  As long as it's off, make sure the seals
were intact and the mating surfaces aren't eroded.

Of course the usual disclaimers apply...

Many people wonder why I drive an old VW bus.  Those that ask wouldn't
understand.
