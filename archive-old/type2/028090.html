My experience:

Bus Depot started out with really great prices relative to others; prices have gone up. Ron used to be top-notch in service; as he's expanded, service has gone down.

My local FLAPS matches or beats Ron's price on most stuff (Roy Rogers, Memphis, TN 901-377-7214). And they're here. Shipping takes about the same and they get their stuff from mostly the same suppliers.

Bus Depot still does a good job on hunting out quality parts and offering great prices on *some* items, including some high quality items.

I'll try to use my local FLAPS first, because they're here and it's easier to solve problems when they arise. When I use Bus Depot in the future, I'll call and ask for Ron specifically because my luck on orders has been *far* better when I dealt with Ron than with others at Bus Depot. He's got a vested interest.

Ron takes the heat, but he gets paid for that. *I* couldn't write off a month-long trip to Europe last year looking for parts...but I also didn't spend 24/7 nursing a business along. In fairness to the lists, I *think* Ron built his business with benefit of his membership on the list(s). He knew all along that he would have to take the heat. In fairness to Ron, I *think* he's trying to do a good job and probably does most of the time. When I've been displeased, I've talked to him candidly about it...because I prefer to help people who *try.&quot; In my conversations, it's obvious that he cares, but the nature of the business and his business practices too keep him from hitting the mark 100 percent of the time. But I have to say in all honesty that I don't think I could have built a business like he has...and I'm glad he did. It's one more good resource out there for parts.

Vote with your wallet! If you've got a good FLAPS, don't discount the value of fostering a good relationship with them. They've got a margin to deal with too and if they know you're a repeat, long-term customer, they'll give you a good rate; if they won't, then they're not a *good* FLAPS. In my case, they'll even stay competitive with mail order houses like Bus Depot in order to bring in my $1500-$2000/year business. On the downside there, my FLAPS sells EMPI stuff and thinks chrome is cool; they cater mostly to the beetle crowd and Japanese cars and only 2 people there know enough about VWs to be literate...so there's a trade-off where ever you go!

Thanks! Joe
