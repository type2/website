I'll be leaving this wonderful list since I sold my bus last night.  I was
worried about her passing inspection and a fellow club member offered me
$1,200. for her.  Needless to say, I jumped on that.  I'll miss the posts
and the fellowship of Type II owners everywhere.

If you see a black, new Beetle with a driver who waves at passing buses,
wave back - it's probably me.

Thanks to everyone!
