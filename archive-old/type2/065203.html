Subject: Swap Engine to AUDI 5 Cyl./Ford V6

There is a garage in Germany offering sets for swapping AUDI 5 Cylinder or 
Ford V6 Engines into VW Vanagons `80 to `91, independent if your vanagon is 
air or water cooled. If there is someone interested I will establish contact 
and do translation, if you will need.

Only for technical questions to this swapping, and if you have access to the 
ham radio packet network, send a mail to DB3JO_at_DK0MWX.#NRW.DEU.EU
