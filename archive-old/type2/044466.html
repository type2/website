John,

Is yours a York aluminum case compressor?  I have a
1980 Westie with this York system (aftermarket).  The
York keeps leaking at the bottom gasket, and so far I
haven't been able to keep it sealed for more than a
year.  Since R12 is too expensive, I'm looking for a
solution also.  I wonder what other compressors will
fit where the York fits (above the exhaust manifold). 
Do you have a cheap source for R12?

Rob
