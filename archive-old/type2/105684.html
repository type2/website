Subject: Stock vs. Weber Progressive Carb on 1.8L

I am in the procees of getting my 74 Westy back up and 
running.  It has a 1.8L Type 4 engine.  I have located a 
NOS pair of Solex 32-34 PDSIT-3 carbs.  Would I be better 
off using these stock carbs or going for a Weber 
Progressive setup?  I have read about the problems that 
several of you have had with the Weber carb, but I am not 
familiar with the reliability/drivabilty of the stock 
setup.  Any advice either way would be greatly 
appreciated.

Mark
