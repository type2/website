Subject: New name for AIRS????

Hey guys, quick poll.

Seeing how AIRS has been worldwide for quite sometime, and is about to hit the 2000 member mark,
what does everyone think about calling it Aircooled International Rescue Squad, instead of Aircooled
Interstate Rescue Squad? A couple foreign members brought it to my attention that they dont have
states, and dont have Interstate highways. They do have a point. It doesnt have quite the same ring
to it but it is more applicable.

Just a thought, what do you think?

AIRS now has over 1800 members and has some cool features planned for it, including but not limited
to a possible WAP database as well as a Searchable Database.
