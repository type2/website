That's what I'd do. I'd take with me every NLA part number that's come up on the list in recent years and stock up on whatever is available.

Unforuntately the dollar is really weak against all other currencies and so everything is going to cost more than last year. Something like a NOS relay lever kit might be less than the $132 it costs here or maybe not after the exchange rate.

Don't forget to report back on your score.
