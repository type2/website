Subject: Re: Oil filter

The best approach is a full flow oil filter.  This requires drilling and
tapping a hole in your case for the oil return line.

Get a copy of Gene Berg's catalog.  It gives details about the best way to
install a full flow filter.

Do not go with oil pumps that return oil from the filter back into the pump. 
These designs are too restrictive and can cause reduced oil flow.
