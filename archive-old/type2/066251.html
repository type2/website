Subject: 1600 heater boxes, garage stuff

        I'm selling the Campbell tract house, and there will be an 
appropriate garage sale this Saturday, July 27, from 9:30am or so to ???

        I've got a pair of rusty but usable 1600 heater boxes for $10,
(I paid a lot more for them when they were dirtier... and then didn't need
'em :) ) and a lot of furnature and household items. Three medium sized
garage tables and a 50's doughnut shop counter will be available at
popular prices,($25 each) as well as a couple of mexican restraunt chairs ($5) 
and a pair of filing cabinents ($35).
        I should have left the extra gates for the single-cab down here
but didn't- got a pair of beater side gates, asking price $70, shown by
appointment only at my storage place in Hayward :(

        Everything will be priced to sell and no reasonable offer refused!

        4660 Westmont Avenue, Campbell CA. Right across from Westmont
High School. About mid-way between the Quito/Westmont corner and
the the San Tomas Aquino/Westmont corner. Cross street London Drive, one 
house back. This house is actually on a little cul-de-sac too small to have 
its own name. House is painted white, with calico roof (matches the cat) 
and my '70 single cab will parked near by. 408 374 8073
