A minor note.  Various advertising claims notwithstanding,
transmitting in the police radar bands requires an FCC license.
Therefore, that last suggestion might not be a good idea, unless you
happen to have such a license on-hand at the time.

I have been considering acquiring such a license for just these
purposes for quite some time, though.  It's pretty obvious that you
don't have to have significant technical knowledge of radio or radar
to get the license.  However, I would probably get a full radar unit,
with the justification that I want to be able to document how quickly
someone was approaching from behind when filling out the rear-end
accident report....
