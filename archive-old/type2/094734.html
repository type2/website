Subject: Re: [T2] Auxiliary battery questions

[...]
standard battery isolators require some fancy wiring to work with bosch 
or motorolla alternators.  stick to the isolation relays instead.  As 
for matching batteries, not if they are run as aux main and not to be 
parelleled for normal operation.  if you are running two batteries in 
parellel for normal operation then it is best if they are as closely 
matched as possible.
