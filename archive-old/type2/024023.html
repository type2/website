Hi there fellow list members. Two quick questions I hope someone can answer.
First, I checked my compression with the engine cold. How will this effect
the readings? Second, my heat exchangers were rotted away, and are now gone
completely, leaving only what looks like a heatsink around the pipes. What
effect, if any, will this have on engine temps? Should I buy some J-tubes
for now? Oops, is that three questions? Oh well, I look forward to your
response.

TIA

Jeff
