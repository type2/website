Subject: Vacuum hose connection

Background: 1973 1700cc with dual Solexes. I was missing the carb
pre-heater attachment to my air cleaner and found one at a junkyard. It
has one hose that attaches to the right &quot;horn&quot; of the air cleaner, and I
was told that the other connection on the &quot;horn&quot; goes to a cross-pipe
that runs under the air cleaner (and I have a vacuum connection on that
which is blocked off at the moment, so it makes perfect sense).

I seem to vaguely recall a conversation a while back about the infamous
little rubber elbows that connect the carb balance tube to the carb
manifolds, and that there was a variation on the right elbow where there
was an additional outlet for a vacuum hose. I have a (cracked) version
of this elbow that just came off my bus, with the additional outlet
blocked with a screw. I just found out I can get a replacement for that
part, so my question is:

What else does that elbow with the extra outlet hook up to (besides the
obvious balance tube and carb manifold)? The parts counter gal said
something about &quot;air cleaner vacuum attachment.&quot; She's not talking about
that other connection on the right &quot;horn&quot; of the air cleaner, is she? If
so (or not), what does that cross-pipe under the air cleaner hook up to?
