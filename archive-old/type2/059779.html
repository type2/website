Subject: Re: Ardmore, OK?

Since my grandparents live(d) in Ardmore, I've had a chance to see some
of Mann's work.  There's a beautiful bug running around town that was
painted by him.  The paint work is flawless; it looks like dark glass. 
The closer you get, the better it looks.  You're in for a treat.  Also,
there's a _really_ big VW junk yard just south of OK City, off I-35. 
You'll see the billboards for it.  You take a state hiway exit to get to
this place.  I went by there on a Sunday, on the way back to East Texas. 
They were closed, but I  looked thru the gate.  Lotsa VW's - looks like a
great place to explore!  8-)
