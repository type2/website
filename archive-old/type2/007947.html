Hi All,

I have to admit that after having this BA4 (out of a VW 412), that I just 
sat on it for 6 months and waited for it to rain before installing it.

I pulled it from an old VW Fastback (412) in a local scrapyard. The kind 
of scrapyard that doesn't know how to spell &quot;Eberspacher&quot;, and just 
charge the regular $25 heater core charge for them.
-although I did pull it on a 104degree day, so I paid in other ways.

If you try to pull one of these out of a 412, take a coil spring 
compressor, and expect about 2 hours for the extraction job. - I took a 
gamble and luckily didn't loose any extremities in the process of 
removing the rear coil spring on the car.

The only issue with this heater is that it's a 2 tubes in, and 2 out 
kind, and isn't going to fit into my bus as nicely as a BA6.

The last couple of days, I cleaned the thing, and decyphered the wiring 
for it, and managed to get it to fire up second time!

It's nice and toasty warm; even pulling in cold air, so it should make my 
bus nice and bearable on those Tahoe ski(ok, snowboard)  weekends.

Has anyone out there ever hooked one of these up to a Type2 ?

I'm guessing that I'll have to put it under the belly of the bus and cut 
the long thick heater tube to allow it to fit, then I'll have to make a 
couple of 'y' adapters to make the 2 air tubes out of the heater flow 
into the one large one on the bus.
-and then make the wiring harness!

During my test run, I only noticed one worrying trait.    After stopping 
the heater, it did run on for about 120 seconds, but a kind of white 
smoke came back out of the combustion fan for about 2 minutes afterwards.

Maybe it's because it just hasn't been run for a while, or on the bench, 
the exhaust isn't quite at the correct angle....

I haven't heard of anyone else doing this, so I'll keep the list posted 
on my progress.  If anyone has done this before, ie, a BA4 into a Type2, 
please p-mail me.

TIA
