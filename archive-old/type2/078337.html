&gt;
&gt;&gt; Yeah, except the Castrol isn't synthetic at all.  It's a cut-rate,
&gt;&gt; half-assed imitation of a synthetic.  Didn't you read the Car and Driver
&gt;&gt; column I posted here?
&gt;
&gt;What should we call it then, &quot;engineered&quot; oil? That actually sounds kinda
&gt;cool--I have engineered oil in my car. (Well, actually I have Shell Rotella
&gt;in my car.)
&gt;--


But it's not cool to pay for synthetic and not get synthetic.  That's a scam.
