Subject: Re: [T2] i saw another commerical with a beetle / and i have a
  bus question

    I see tons of VW's in commercials and movies. I have a theory that 
there is a bus or beetle in every movie made set in a time period when they 
could have one. i see them constantly....I should have made it my 
senior thesis...lol
   
  Weak batteries usually die in the cold, I would sugest replacing it 
(especially if it's over a couple years old) and just check the charge 
rate to make sure it's oK. If it is and it keeps dying you could have a 
parasitic draw, in which current is drawn when the car isn't on. I 
wouldn't go jumping the gun on that one yet though.....You can always get a 
battery maintainer so it doesn't die too, any auto store should have 
one I'd asume......
   
  peace,
  Tracy
