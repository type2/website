Subject: Re: [T2] Charcoal can function?

On a related note: is there a way to replace the charcoal in these things
without having to buy a new cannister?  These things are ~$50 new and I've
never found them in stock anywhere.  Bently says to replace every 30k (or
thereabouts).  Can you just go to an aquarium shop to get new activated
charcoal pellets?  I've searched the archive but haven't found any answers
on this one.

&gt; The hose from the fan shroud pushes air through the charcoal can. The  other
&gt; hose should attach to the air cleaner housing so that fumes are sucked  into
&gt; the intake.
