Subject: [T2] Gas Heaters - Seattle

I've been searching the archives for info on the gas heater repair
spezialist I recall others mentioning in the Seattle area. I have a client
with a 76 Westy who is interested and would appreciate if someone could
provide the info. I don't know why but several searches through the
archives just hasn't identified this reference. 

Thanks,


T.P. Stephens aka Doktor Tim
