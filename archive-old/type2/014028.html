Subject: Re: [T2] Need help replacing a push rod tube

Corerect! They come out through the head after you get that cheezy little
spring out and your rocker arms off.
Just grip them and rock the channel locks or other straight plier and
they'll come out, even if the PO sealed them in with super glue.

&gt; &gt; Take a pair of channel lock pliers and brace them against the

&gt; 
&gt; to clearify that a little, the push rods come out through the
&gt; heads. unlike the older engines in which they were squeezed between 
&gt; the
&gt; head and block.
