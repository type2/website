Subject: '77 bus: interior measurements

[This message was posted by a non-subscriber. Please reply to the

Anybody out there got the measurements for the interior of a 1977
VW Bus? Standard (not Westy) interior with two bench seats
behind driver/passenger seats.

I'd go measure it myself, but the deep, blue Pacific lies twixt me
and my bus. 

End goal here is to design and build bed, cabinets and similar niceties
for camping in the vehicle.

Thanks.
