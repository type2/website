X-Diagnostic: MESSAGE MAY NOT BE TOPICAL

Hello all:

I'm a first-time VW owner, and am quickly learning all about my '71 panel
bus.  Recently, I started the engine, only to have it run for about 2
seconds, then die.  It would not start after that.  I diagnosed the problem
as a dead condenser, and since I had some free time on my hands, decided to
do a few &quot;upgrades&quot; to my engine.  I put in a new 009 with a Compufire
module (which is not quite as easy as advertised, I can go into this if
anyone asks), and put in a new Weber Progressive carb.  I finally got the
engine re-started, but it ran very poorly.  I can't seem to get it timed
correctly, and it runs rough until it's warmed up.  However, after it warms,
the engine idle starts to go quite high, probably at least 2K RPM.
Yesterday at lunch, I asked a fellow employee at work, who happens to know
alot about VW's, if he could look at my engine.  Within minutes, he
diagnosed the problem as my left-side cylinders are not firing.  There's a
spark going to each of the left-side spark plugs.  I'm basically running on
only the right-side of my engine.  Since it's been raining here in NorCal
since Tuesday night, and I don't have a covered space to work on my bus, I
may not be able to pull the left-side valve cover until the weekend.

Has anyone out there ever had this problem, and does anyone have any idea
what to look for once I take off the valve cover??

Thanks!!

Jim Hood
