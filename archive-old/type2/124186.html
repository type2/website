Subject: my wife wants a price/amount estimate

For paint for a 1970 bus, the bus is completely &quot;disassembled&quot; (all windows,
seals, lights, interior, ect. has been removed), and is practically rust
free!!!!!!! There is some small spots of surface rust ( &lt; 6sq in TOTAL) that
I'm going to treat with POR-15, then use &quot;Tie-Coat Primer&quot;.

The primary color is red (below the gutter)
The roof is white (above the gutter)

Cost is a concern, but the equipment and know how (her uncle is a painter)
is available.

Any info/recommendations appreciated on:
Paint Manufacturers, where/who to buy from, how much paint we need, how much
it should cost (max/min)

Thanks,
MikeL
