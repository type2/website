Subject: Looking for help in Ft. Worth TX area

Hello all,
I am attempting to yank the 1600sp out of my
'69 campmobile and I have loosened or
removed all but the two bolts on the top
of the tranny.  I am now at the point where
I need some help for about an hour or so.
I need someone to help balance the engine
on my floor jack while I crawl under and remove
the last of the bolts.  I will then need help after
I attach my engine stand to hoist it up to my work
bench.

So here is my plea.....Is there anyone in the
Dallas/Ft. Worth area that can spare an hour
or so this weekend to give me a hand??

If you know the north Ft. Worth area, I live
in Keller, TX off FM1709.

Later,
