&gt; I have established the cold start valve is not operating on my 78 Westy.

As stated by others, you need to know if the thermotime switch isn't sending
power to the cold start valve, or if the cold start valve is getting power
but just not opening.


&gt; My question is,  As a temporary cold weather bodge, if I
&gt; can get the connector off the thermo time switch and  jump the connector
&gt; terminals will it then operate the cold start valve?

If the thermotime switch is broken, then bringing power to the cold start
valve should open it, allowing the extra fuel needed on cold startups.


&gt; I understand it only
&gt; works while the engine is cranking and will automatically shut off after
10
&gt; seconds.  I assume these two protections against flooding are handled by
the
&gt; central control unit.

The thermotime switch handles the shutoff, not the ECU.  If you jumper the
cold start valve you'll need to manually disconnect it.
