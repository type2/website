Subject: Re: [T2] Piezo ignition

&gt; The piezo igniter on my west fridge doesn't seem to be working.

Neat that it has one. These usually last a really long time, but 
sometimes they go. Are you sure it is the ignition, and not the regulator 
or something else. I would suspect a part other than this first.

&gt; Does it work by hammering on the crystal? ie No voltage applied anywhere.

Correct. The crystal releases electrical energy when deformed. Hit the
crystal and you get a sparc. The trouble is if you hit the crystal too
hard you can ruin the crystal structure and so you get no more sparc.
Intersting enough, it works in reverse too. Apply a volatage to a piezo
crystal, and you deform the crystal. There are all sorts of interesting 
applications of this side of piezoelectricity. Microphones, 
accelerometers, ultrasonic transducers, bender element actuators, 
phonograph pick-ups, and signal filters just to name a few.

&gt; I've taken it apart and there doesn't seem much to it!

There really isn't. That is the great thing about them. If it is just the 
crystal that is bad you can get a new one out of those long BBQ lighters 
with the trigger you pull. They have crystals in them that you may be able 
to pull out to replace yours.

&gt; Can I get a replacement?

Most likely. An RV shop will most likely have the part, or can replace it 
with an electric ignition. I would look for a local RV shop that has a 
repair shop and talk to them.
