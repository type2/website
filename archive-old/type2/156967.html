&gt; hello everyone,
&gt;        according to the bentley manual, test the
&gt; cylinder head temp sensor
&gt; with an ohmeter at 68*F.  it is way hotter here in
&gt; georgia than that.  my
&gt; thermometer reading at the time i checked the
&gt; resistance on this part was
&gt; 89*F.   the resistance reading was 1826 ohms.  the
&gt; bentley says
&gt; approximately 2500 ohms.  if the resistanc eis
&gt; higher or lower replace the
&gt; temp sensor II.   is there a scale for variable
&gt; ambient temps or should i
&gt; just replace the darned thing.  what are your

You're good. It's right where it should be or close
enough. More resistance makes it run richer, less
makes it run leaner. It is not uncommon to add
resistance to that circuit to make the engine run a
little richer for freeway driving, for example. I used
to run a variable resistor that I could adjust
instantly from the drivers seat.

Anyway - your sensor is right where it should be. Was
there some symptom you were trying to chase down?
