Subject: 78 FI Spark Plug Part Deux

Ok, recap of issue:
&quot;1978 2.0L FI unit. Going through the motions of swapping
sparkplugs.Following Muir's book. Except that one hole/threads looks to be
messed up at the beginning. I tried other plugs and they get a few  turns
down by hand, and then stop. Tried once with ratchet, but that really did
not help.&quot;

With Cliff's help over the weekend, we took a part a lot of the engine since
that is what you do when you want to replace/work on something totally not
connected to the Spark Plug thread issue. Took AMC Head off and saw a lot of
shavings inside. Good thing we opted that way.  Tried the HeliCoil approach
to no avail. Need to find Machinist in Portland, OR that can spend 30 mins
or so making this sparkplug hole WHOLE.

Anyone in Portland know of a good VW/Machinist Shop that could do this?  
I am hoping to get it done this week so I can reassemble the whole engine
this coming weekend.  The next weekend is to do the CV Joints and then
Transmission &amp; Engine reinstall.

To Courtney, Bob, Shaggy, George, Don and David:  Thanks for all your
pointers.  All were great suggestions and help.  I would have loved to not
have taken off the head, but since I did not want shavings and I am not the
idiot that John Muir thinks I am, I needed to.
