Subject: Re: [T2] Brake light switch

&gt; I suppose my biggest question is: why are there two switches on the

Jason,

On 1967 and later buses there are two separate braking circuits.  Both are
controlled by the one master cylinder but one circuit does your front
brakes and the other does your rear brakes.  You have one switch for each
circuit.  If you look in the wiring diagram, the wires from both switches
lead to a canister plugged ito your dash that has a &quot;B&quot; printed on it.
In that canister there is a simple logical &quot;and&quot; gate.  If both switches
are in the same position, on or off, then the &quot;and&quot; is true and the &quot;B&quot;
light stays out.  If one circuit fails then the &quot;and&quot; is not true and the
&quot;B&quot; light lights to warn you that you have lost half of your brakes!

&gt; It also seems as if that one switch is duff, and that I'll have to
&gt; replace it.  I guess pulling that switch implies having to bleed the
&gt; lines?

It does, I am sorry to say.  You will want to take a turkey baster and
suck most of the fluid out of the brake fluid resevoir (toss the baster
afterwards!)  or have a cup under the MC to catch the contents of your
resevoir as they stream thru.
