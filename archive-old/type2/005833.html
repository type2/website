Subject: berg short shift kit for sale
Date: Thu, 26 Apr 2001 08:52:46 -0500

I got a Berg short shift kit for my '81 Westfalia in the mail from a
vanagon_dot_com group purchase the other day.  I installed it (easy
installation) and decided to take it back off.  It did shorten your shifter
throw by about half an inch front and back.  However, it made it hard to get
into reverse.  If I adjusted it to where you got reverse then 1st was
slightly to the right of all the way left (made it hard to find 1st).  I
didn't feel like messing with it anymore so it's now for SALE!!  Say
$15+shipping?  Any takers?  I didn't get the extension, it must be nice from
what I hear, I just got the short shift..
