&gt;   I use Krylon or Rustoleum (whichever is cheaper at the

For my 912 engine, I power brushed every square inch. I could not get off a 
portion of the factory paint around the preheater tubes. It was baked on 
and as hard as anything I've seen short of powder coat. I just feathered 
the edges. I then went all around and straightened out the edges and dings. 
I then hit it all with 400 wet, cleaned with detergent, rinsed, then dried 
and set in the hot summer sun for 20 minutes. I then used a rust converter, 
metal prep. I sprayed it with Rustoleum, many light coats 5 to 10 minutes 
apart, gloss black. That was 15 years ago. I can rinse it with water and 
wipe it down today and it looks near perfect, certainly concourse worthy. 
Looks like if you prep it right and keep it clean it will last indefinitely.


&gt;Remember that the factory paint job was not exactly the ultimate finish.
&gt;the paint was there to prevent corrosion, nothing more.

It did tend to last at least as long as the original motor. Most of what we 
see today has been R&amp;Red many times and most repainted in a great variety 
of ways. I still have factory finish on my 72 Bus and it is serviceable 
enough that I didn't repaint it when I took it apart to replace just seals 
and gaskets. Getting very close to 200K miles now on the tin and 80k on the 
engine and function nominal. German materials and design give super long 
life (read super low cost per mile) when maintained and operated in a 
German manner.
