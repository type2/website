Subject: Re: [T2] font of knowledge, FI, injector trigger???

Bob said:


 the continuing saga of trying to get this 78 2l engine running again...

 have been going very methodically thru the EFI trouble shooting guide.

 what &quot;appears&quot; to be the problem is the injectors are only intermittently getting the trigger signal to fire,
when they get the signal the engine runs, when they don't it doesn't.

ok, so &quot;Why&quot;???

 on pg 11 of the manual I get to &quot;no triggering impulse from coil terminal 1&quot;

&quot;test light does not flicker&quot; when connected to term 1 of control unit.

 I get the impression the light should be off and flicker on.  but it is on and does not flicker off or
anything else.???

?? should light be on?? or off with ignition on but not operating starter

 so it says check wire between term 1 coil, &amp; term 1 of ECU.   well that checks out, the light never goes
out??

 then says

 .breaker not adjusted or defective.  ??
.condenser shorting to ground.  have tried 3 different condensers.
.coil defective, have tried 2 different coils.

also it is happening intermittently ..

 ???????

also there appears to be an error in the troubleshooting manual.

 on pg 53 about 1/3 way down page under &quot;trouble in ignition system&quot; it says;

 .&quot;suppression condenser incorrectly connected on terminal 1 instead of terminal 15&quot;     shouldn't that be the
other way round?????

 ----------------------------------------------------------------------

A &quot;suppression condenser&quot; is not the ignition condensor. It is a static suppresor for the radio.On older US
cars, it mounts to the side of the coil.

Are you running points or electronic ignition?

If you are running points and the trigger signal to the ECU is intermitttant; you have dirty/bad point
contact.
