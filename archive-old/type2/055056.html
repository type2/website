I pulled the Oil Pressure Relief Valve, it all looked good, but I have no 
idea to know whether the spring is good or not. I'll replace it. Also the 
book very breifly mentions another Oil Pressure Relief Valve between the 
pusrod tubes on the #1 cylinder. I could not find this valve.

Thanks! Marvin

&gt;change your oil pressure relief springs; that's a good place to start.
