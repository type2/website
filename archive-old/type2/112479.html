Subject: Re: Fluke 77 continuity?

John,

My leads on my fluke 77 are only 4.5' long. I don't see how I am to hook the 
neg lead to the neg terminal on the battery and test voltage on something in 
the dash area, the bus is 16' long and one of the wires I wanted to test 
continuity/resistance on goes from the starter to the dash/instrument cluster. 

Do they make longer leads?
