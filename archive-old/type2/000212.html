&gt; So what do other type2 operators do to keep their blood temps and
&gt; pressures down in traffic? Any tips will be appreciated.

Nothing. Just ignore them and you're fine. There are more important things
to worry about.

Anyway, you'd expect that driving on older underpowered car gets more of a
problem every year. Actually it's less of a problem than about 5 years ago.
Why, you ask? Traffic gets denser and denser every day and  the average
speed gets lower and lower. So rather than getting irritated I have fun when
after a long drive I see that Beamer or Merc that whirled  me by half an
hour ago is just in front of me at some traffic light. And my daily driver
is an '81 Vanagon diesel with a top of about 65 mph so I know what going
slow means. By comparison my '77 1600DP is a race car.
