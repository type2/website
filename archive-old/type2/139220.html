Subject: Re: [T2] Tuning 72 bus

&gt; - I have to crank the engine quite a bit and use the gas pedal to get 
&gt; it to
&gt; start. Once it starts, it accelerates and drives normally. What is the
&gt; normal amount of time required to start the engine? If the pedal 
&gt; required?
&gt;

My '73 1700 w/Kadrons starts on the keyturn pretty much every time. Hot 
or cold.
I made sure to put the biggest battery I could fit in the space back 
there, I dont know if that makes THAT much difference or not in your 
situation.

I have to give the gas a 1/2 press as I turn the key and she sparks up. 
Being chokeless I then have to give it a touch of gas to warm up.
