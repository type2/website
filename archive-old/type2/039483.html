Hello list!

Summer has finally arrived to Scandinavia also, and so I took my bus for a
ride yesterday. Everything seemed to be just fine. When I got back home, I
heard some clicking noises coming from the back and I thought I should adjust
the valves today.

So, I let my bus get some sleep and tried to adjust the valves today, but..
Both valves for No. 1 were too tight so I set the right clearance and went
for No. 2 cylinder. Exhaust valve OK, intake - big problem! I could not get
the feeler cauge in there even with the adjusting stud completely removed
from the rocker arm.

It seems that both valve spring plates (if that is what they are called) are
higher than No. 1 cylinder plates. What could this mean? Have my valves broken
even though the engine was rebuilt only 5000 kilometers ago? How can the plates
suddenly be higher? I can do only the basic maintenance when it comes to
engines, so should I just send my engine to be rebuilt once again?
If it helps the engine number is B216470X.

Any help? Thanks.
