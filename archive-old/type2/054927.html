Happy Friday, oh fellow fetishists of German steel.

I rewired Russ to allow the battery to sit in the one remaining battery
tray(driver's side.)  The new ground connection has noticeably improved the
performance of every electrical device Russ has.  I now have a working
cigarette lighter, which is too bad because I was just about to quit smoking
until this sign (or is it a portent) came.  The gods want me to have cancer
I guess. ;p  

I removed and cleaned/replaced the terminals on both my rear lights, making
sure to poorly label every connector and where it went with tape that
smeared and fell off at every opportunity.   Additionally, the PO was
something of an avant gard wiring performance artiste' and left me a gaggle
of wires running to and fro for no obvious reason.  Using my almost
freakishly uncanny ability of figuring out which wires do what with a line
tester and a lovely assistant I got it all working again.  Except the
reverse lights.   So, now, when I throw old Russ into reverse and start
backing up it's news to everyone but me.  Does anyone know where the wire
running from the transmission (I'm guessing) to the reverse lights comes
into the engine compartment?

In other news, my alternator/generator light doesn't come on when I turn the
ignition on and so I'll be needing to trace that out after I check the bulb.
By the way, what's the difference between an alternator and a generator and
how do I find out which one I have?

Last inane question:  MY gas gauge leaps about wildly while driving.  It's
more stable when the car isn't moving, but doesn't seem reliable anyhow.  Is
there some kind of short, deranged midget hiding behind my dash with a pair
of tweezers and an inkling for raising hell or is it just some sort of
boring old electrical short or something even more weird and ghastly?

Thanks in advance!  And yes, my first true love is writing, but I'm not man
enough to face the requisite alcoholism that I would need to be both bitter
and successful. :)
