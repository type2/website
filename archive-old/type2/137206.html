Subject: Re: [T2] Snap-on is crazy

 Mark, I bought a 39 dollar Chinese digital caliper, and it is dead accurate
to half a thou. I checked it by using feeler gauges. Then I checked it
against a Starret micrometer and it was again, perfect. Save your money for
new clutches and stuff. :-) BTW, I also have a pointer style torque wrench
from Sears, made in Germany, and compared it to my click-type torque wrench.
It also was very good.

Well, that's probably right. But I think it's part of the evolution of

a bus DIYer. The first time you do a rebuild, you don't measure

anything. You say &quot;if it doesn't look bad, how bad can it be&quot;? And then

you put the engine back in and start it up and the crankshaft sheers

the bolts of your fan.

 

You ask the list how this could have happened, and someone replies

with: &quot;did you measure endplay, and install the right shims.&quot;

 

And you think, huh. Endplay. Okay, I'll measure endplay. Out comes the

engine.

 

And so it goes. Your standards slowly ratchet heavenward.

 

The absurd thing is that I am going to return this micrometer instead

of paying out the $228. And the next time I do a rebuild, I'm going to

wish I had that micrometer and probably buy it.

 

But this time around, I'm more interested in replacing my

torsion-pointer torque wrench with something that accurately measures

torque.
