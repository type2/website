X-Diagnostic: MESSAGE MAY NOT BE TOPICAL

Ok, here's whats up. A friend at work came to me knowing that I worked on
VW's. This guy, I'll call him Bob for now. Bob has a Bus that needs an
engine. He asked me to find an engine. So I found a salvage yard in my area
with an engine for $300 complete. He said that he would not warrenty it
because he could not start it(no starter). I got it home and pulled the
intake manifold to put on the carb, it was FI, and found that #3 intake
valve was shot, sucked up in the head. I called the yard and I am just out
of luck, they did offer to sell me another engine for $50, but it is a 1.7l
I think, and the one with the bad head is a 79 2.0l. So if I get the other
engine I can not use the heads off it, I would just have to hope that it is
good. The engine in Bobs bus is a 1.8l but has a bad valve, so I can not use
his old heads. The 2.0l I got has the square ports, not the oval like the
older ones. Anyone in Wa. have a good square port head? It looks to me like
I am going to get screwed all trying to help out a friend of a friend. It
makes me want to never help anyone again, but I know I will. I will just be
smarter next time. If you have any suggestions, please let me know. I hate
to take it in the shorts on this. Bob just wants to get the thing running to
sell it.
