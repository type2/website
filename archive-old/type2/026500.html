&gt;I'm wondering if it has something to do with the rubber hose and 
&gt;the sending unit being mounted above your engine.  

I run 2 type IV motors with the oil pressure senders mounted at the end of
12&quot; rubber hoses (and no, this is not the fabled &quot;twin engine bus&quot;).  Both
of them show me oil pressure within the first second or so.  I don't think
this is an issue of the sender starving for pressure because of where/how it
is mounted.  The only way that could be an issue is if your hose is kinked
or something.
