&gt;   Well we awoke to the white world of winter in Baltimore this morning. 
&gt; The kids went berserk.  The bus was covered in snow.

weeeeh, glad you made it.

&gt;   The winter snow driving caused a bit of marital discord though.  My
&gt; teeth were on edge most of the morning.  Had to keep reminding my
&gt; husband that you don't ever let a vw lug.  When to down shift and all
&gt; that.  I freaked when some dude started blasting down the on ramp and
&gt; then began to spin out by us.
&gt; 
&gt;   The bus has surpassed all of our expectations for this trip.  Wow!  She
&gt; is not pinging in the least, is this the use of premium?  She was doing
&gt; that in SC on the low hills.

I generally use mid grade 

&gt;   Oh yea, we came via Hwy 83 from Cockeysville Md, to Hwy 30, got off
&gt; track and had to take Hwy 10 back up to 222 and the parkway up to 81 etc
&gt; etc...  Had some slowdown for construction but not much.

took the scenic route eh, 222 is really a beautiful drive up thru the
Amish (dutch) country

how lond did it take???

glad you made it ok
