Subject: Re: [T2] How many solenoids..

Some carburetors have solenoid operated valves.  In my fire protection work,
we use electrically operated valves all the time, controlled by solenoids.
I'm not sure of their exact purpose on a carburetor, to open and close some
passage, naturally.

&gt;    1. A current-carrying coil of wire that acts like a magnet when
&gt; a current passes through it.
&gt;
&gt;    2. An assembly used as a switch, consisting of a coil and a
&gt; metal core free to slide along the coil axis under the influence of
&gt; the magnetic field.

&gt; On a basic type 2 bus, are here any other solenoids??  If so, what
&gt; are their functions.
