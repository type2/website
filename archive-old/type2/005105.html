Hello all,

 I was wondering if anyone on the list knows who had a 79 Westy at Buses
nowhere near the Arch this past year.

There is a VW dealer here in OKC, Cable VW, who has, at first glance, a nice
looking 79 on the used car lot. I went out and inspected it today, and saw a
sticker that had Buses Nowhere Near the Arch printed on it and the  #117
written on it.

For those who are interested in it, I called the dealer yesterday and was
told that it had been totally restored and for only $6900 it could be mine!!
Well, if you want to know what I found, e-mail me off list. By the way, my
73 that I sold for $2500 was in allot better shape!!
