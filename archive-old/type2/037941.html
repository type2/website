Hi All
I have a 83 Vanagon air cooled with dual Weber 40 DCNF carbs that were
on it when purchased. It was a non runner and I repaired the engine but
have no tuning info for these carbs. It runs well and has good power at
high revs but there is a bit of a flat spot on acceleration. These carbs
have huge venturis so maybe poor power at low revs in normal. I am
willing to put with with this because the power much better than the
stock FI. Gas mileage poor but I expected it.
Any one out there have tuning info on these carbs? Also there does not
seem to be any place to connect the vacuum to the dist.
Thanks to all the Tuning Wizards out there,
Jack Handy
