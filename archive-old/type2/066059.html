I am going to look at a '73 Beetle, that the owner claims has 26,000

&gt;
&gt; If it really is all original its worth it, but if not, then no. Can you
&gt;
&gt; offer some tips as to how I can tell if everything is original.
This is the same as looking at a bus- check the front end for wear. Wiggle the
tie rods, and see how loose everything is.
Also, check the rubber covers of the pedals, to see how worn they are. Likewise
the seats. BAsically, see if the car looks well-worn or not. MAke sure it looks
like 26,000, as opposed to 126,00, which will look the same on the odometer.
Also check to see if they have all the service records...
good luck
