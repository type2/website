|Isn't that basically what a pancake's setup is?  Fan cools engine, 
blower pushes air over heat exchangers for heating, and never the twain 
shall
|meet?

Nope. The late bay has two paths for intake air. First air moves from 
the blower motor, passed a flapper at the blower motor through the paper 
tube and into the riser off the heat exchanger. The exchanger also has 
an outlet from the engine fan housing, so air in this route goes from 
the engine fan, past the flaps at the bottom of the fan housing and into 
the exchanger. This leads to several possible scenarios:

a) Blower Pressure Higher Than Fan Pressure -&gt; Blower flaps open, fan 
flaps closed.
b) Blower Pressure Lower Than Fan Pressure -&gt; Blower flaps closed, fan 
flaps open.
c) Blower Pressure Equal To Fan Pressure -&gt; Both partly open I guess. 
Not a steady state really, so not likely to last for very long.

Except at idle the engine does all the blowing and the flaps on the 
blower motor are closed. Turning the blower on running down the highway 
doesn't do any good in my experience. Now if you replaced the blower 
with some high output bilge blowers you may be able to change the 
pressure in the blower circuit so that you are in case a most of the 
time. This would also have the upshot of making all the cooling air 
moved by the engine fan actually go over the engine instead of through 
the heat exchangers.
