&gt;D'oh!  Does this go for The Type4 engine as well?

Nope!  Ah, wonderful wonderful Type 4 engine.
The Type 4 engine seal is a one-piece seal.  It is made of a foam 
rubber type material and so unfortunately doesn't hold up as well as 
it should but it is much easier to install.  It's still no picnic, 
but you pretty much have to have the engine installed in the Bus to 
install the seal on the Type 4 engine.  Seems that the seal is 
installed most easily from under the van but you may have to do part 
of it from above and part from below.  You will probably scrape up 
your fingers too.  But at least you don't have to pull the engine ;-)

On the Vanagon, the seal is even more different.  It's a rubber seal 
that clamps onto the tin all the way around the engine, and you 
CANNOT install that seal with the engine in.  Well, it might be 
theoretically possible but I wouldn't want to try it.
