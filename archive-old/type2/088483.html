Subject: Re: [T2] Problem Solved! Rebuilt Engine Troubles + WV

It's really wierd that they will run at all with the plug wires wrong, but
they will, and they'll even go pretty good sometimes. Go figure.. &quot;The
little engine that could!&quot;  LOL  Jan B

 So simple - the plug wires were hooked to the distributor wrong.  All the
stuff I checked and changed to try to get
&gt; it to work right, and yet it was that easy!

ps.. Now double check your timing!
