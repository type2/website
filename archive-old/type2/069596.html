Subject: Re: valve adjustment proceedure

Because the firing order is 1-4-3-2, with the engine turning clockwise.
If you start at 1, and turn the crank counter-clockwise, you get
1-2-3-4.

I think its real easy to remember.

&gt; Simply to make it easier (4,3,2,1), or is there some kind of REAL reason?
