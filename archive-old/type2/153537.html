Subject: RE: [T2] AridZona

Bless you and thanks.  Just trying to help out others in their search for VW
Buses, Aridzona is noted for some nice clean Autos of any make.  At 70 years
young,  I have put together many happy busers. TWWM, uj

I hope you will continue to post from AridZona.  Let those who find it
tedious to read, STOP READING THEM!

Sounds pretty simple to me?!

Tell you what.  All I have been doing is relaying info about AridZona Bus
Stuff.  Many times I have been asked to check out the Bus as it is somewhere
in AridZona.  I do all of this for free! I have put many buyers and sellers
together. If this is such a burden the  two Bus lists, then no problem.
What happens in AridZona will now stay in AridZona.
