&gt; A couple of weeks ago, the subject of refilling the throwaways came up.

&gt; Harbor Freight offers an adapter to refill them from 20 lb cylinders and they advertise them to be Safe and

It isn't illegal to refill the cylinder.  It is illegal to transport the
cylinder once refilled.

How can they tell?  No idea!
