Subject: Strange Oil Level

The questions never end.  A couple of days ago I had to do an on-the-road
oil change - fortunately I was camping at the time and had a nice campsite
in which to work.  Anyway, in checking the oil several times since doing
so, I'm seeing that the oil level is way above what I usually see after my
oil changes: like, substantially above the upper line on the dipstick. 
I've put in the same amount of oil (approx. 3.7 quarts) as usual, which
normally puts the oil level right at the full mark when I'm at home.  (I
know that buses are extremely susceptible to oil level discrepencies when
parked on variable-level surfaces - mine is the worst.)  I'm at a loss
because I know how much I put in there and should be well with that, but am
also thrown by that high level whenever I check the oil - knowing that too
much oil is not good.  Does anyone have any idea why the level would change
like this?  One weird thought I've had is that the new filter is not full
of oil (hence the high level) - do filters ever NOT fill with oil for
whatever reason?  Just a thought.  Thanks for any opinions!
