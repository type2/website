Hi All,

Obscure Part Needed:

In the process of &quot;fixing&quot; the sunroof on my '78 I managed to break
a lifter. The lifter is the piece where the cable attaches which pushes
up the back of the sunroof when it is closed. I can provide a picture if
needed.

Any leads on where I can find one are appreciated...

Question:

My bus does not have any seal between the sunroof and the body, instead there
is a 1/2&quot; gap all the way around. I saw another bus which looked like it had
a seal there. Was I mistaken or is something supposed to go there?

Thanks!

Mark
