Ah yes, so I do. Nice QA on my part there huh? I'll try to get to it
tonight, maybe do the tent article too. Not sure if I can since we are
preparing for our trip down to &quot;Gathering of the Vibes&quot; on Friday. Should
be an adventure with 2 little kids. Hopefully the suspension won't collapse
with all the &quot;kid equipment&quot; along for the ride.

Jeff,
  Page 3 (that you scanned in) is bolixed-up (technical term for &quot;you need
