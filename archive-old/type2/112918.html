&gt;  the alternator that came on the engine has a cable from it

&gt; one....but the other one comfuses me....it has four wires
&gt; brown, black, red, and green.
&gt; There is nowhere I can find on the bus where this would
&gt; go...in fact I am not sure what should connect to the
&gt; alternator??

Voltage Regulator..... remember that ?  

Your plug with the brown, black, red, and green plugs into the Voltage
regulator,, front right side of the firewall in the engine compartment.

The Black wire is &quot;probably&quot; not required,, I think I have been told it was for
Westfalia ..... IT IS LIVE all the time,, Tape it up and restrain it in a safe
location if you do not use it.

The small Red wire in the plug should have a blue wire tail,,, it plugs into a
single blue wire in the same area, for the dash light,, and IS required!

The large RED wire is B+ and can go to the starter as stock, or the Battery B+
terminal,, your choice.
