Hi Craig,

You're right about Jerry West at &quot;European Cooler
Air&quot;, he seemed real helpfull.  He told me the leaking
seal on the bottom of my York compressor was all too
common.  Anyone know any good goop to seal that bottom
plate?  It uses a paper gasket, and I thought I'd try
coating both sides with some type of Permatex.  It has
to withstand 300 psi at least.

One thing that seemed to keep increasing with every
re-telling is how much HP the York requires.  He
mentioned 12 HP vrs 1.5 for the Sanyo rotary, but I
thought you had recalled 6 HP.  Anyway, I know the AC
knocks the mileage down to 15 from 19 or 20, so it's
using some real power.

Jerry has had good success with Freeze 12, and said
there was a lesser known product called Free 12 that
also worked well.  He has used this refrigerant in a
couple of old systems.  Have you ever used it?  I'll
bet it's a lot cheaper than R-12.

Rob
