Subject: hazard flashers

The hazard flashers on my '76 aren't working.  The hazard circuit was a 
little more visually complicated than I expected.

In any case, the symptom is:

	- right and left turn signals work as expected

	- when the hazard knob is pulled to the &quot;on&quot; position,
	  the dashboard turn signal indicator lights up solid,
	  but the lights don't flash.

All of the wires appeared to be hooked up correctly, but I'll 
double-check them again.

My questions are:

	- do the hazard flashers use the same flasher relay
	  that the turn signals so, or does it include its
	  own relay in the switch (this is kind of what it looked
	  like, to me)

	- anyone else encountered the above symptom before?
