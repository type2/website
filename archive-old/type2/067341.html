&gt;You are the original company with a
&gt;soul but, now, even Saturn is beating you at your own game.

True. Too true, ultimately true, irrefutably true.

They make Saturns here, and we're close to them for the same reason that
people in Milwaukee were close to AMCs. People in Milwaukee actually drove
Gremlins and Matadors. Not because they were better cars (they were awful),
but because we knew the people who made them, so they *must* be better. The
relationship is the thing. Always. This *is* marketing.

Saturn sez: we don't talk down to you. One price, take it or leave it,
you're the judge. If you don't like it, we'll sell it to the next guy
because it can stand on its own. We don't have to hustle you.

VW said: a bit of gas, a trickle of oil. It's not for everybody, but it's
unique, and for those who understand it's perfect. And if you don't
understand, go get a Fairlane, because that's your fate. We don't have to
hustle you.

Now, though, VW sez: if you buy this you get a free prize inside! If you
buy this you get a cartoon! If you buy this your life won't be dismal!
Lookit this commercial!

FWIW, if I ever buy a new car it will be a Saturn. They actually run ads
featuring the Saturn Nation (&quot;Ladies! Come on in! The guy from the
factory's gonna talk!&quot;). We had a VW Nation once. Still do, but it's got
nothing to do with VWOA. We run it now, part-time.
