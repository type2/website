Subject: Re: [T2] Shift rod bushings

&gt; Chris,
&gt; 
&gt; And, unless Busdepot has changed vendors(I think these only come from one
&gt; place now), you are going to have to modify the holes in your shifter in
&gt; order to get them to stay in...they need to be a little larger than they
&gt; are now.
&gt; 
&gt; I bought some from both busdepot and someplace else...they were exactly
&gt; the same....too big for the shift rod holes....

dave,

i would suggest modifying the bushings, not the shift rod. this can be done
with a dremmel tool or sharp knife, it is a finicky job, but do-able.

it is not likely that you will find NOS bushings, so doing as you suggest
will not likely have any long-term repercussions, but it still makes me feel
a whole lot better making the the ill-fitting part FIT THE BUS, rather than
making the bus FIT THE ILL-FITTING PART.

by the way, when i last did this job, i tossed the aftermarket bushings in
frustration, they were absolute crap in every way - poorly molded, badly
fitting etc. luckily the ones i took out were fine to re-use.
