Subject: tranny leaks

I'll be dropping my engine this weekend to primarily fix some leaks. While
adjusting my clutch I think I saw a
leak at the base of the clutch lever (on the outside of the tranny.) I
suspect its coming out the main shaft as well. Its starting to leave a
substantial puddle, but I've already purchased a main input shaft seal.
Q:If I were to order one what would the name of the clutch lever his seal
be? and are they hard to install?
Q: Also I've been told that I don't need to prop up my tranny on my '78 when
I drop my engine like   earlier models. Is the tranny supported on top?
