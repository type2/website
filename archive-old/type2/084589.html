Subject: Re: [T2] 81 Vanagon


&gt;
&gt; &gt; Hello,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I bought an 81 Vanagon a couple of years ago.  It does not run and was
&gt;told
&gt; &gt; it needs a new engine.  But I am hoping for a rebuilt engine
&gt;and
&gt; &gt; then nothing else to go wrong.  Any advise would be great.  Also, any
&gt; &gt; recommendations for a VW mechanic in Northern Idaho.  Thank you.
&gt; &gt;

Any vehicle that sits for 2 years unused is likely going to have brake 
issues. The hydraulic fluid turns to muck and leaks start showing up. On 
any vehicle this old, anything that you don't verify as functional could 
well be or become a problem shortly after putting back in use. Long term 
non-use is also very hard on fuel pumps and FI components. Be sure to clean 
the fuel tank before sending filthy rotten old fuel to your new motor. 
Don't throw money at luck. Have the vehicle inspected for problems before 
you start spending fistfulls of money. Don't know anyone in North Idaho, 
but I do know of a fellow in the Spokane Valley nearby named Dana Cary who 
has a long background with VW/Porsche from way back in the Valley 
Porsche/Audi days. He certainly has the knowledge and skills to put you in 
touch with the facts if you get the chassis to him for an inspection.

If you go for the motor only and hope for the best, your friends are 
probably right, save your money. If, however, you do the work right and put 
everything in safe and reliable order, they can be shown to be dead wrong. 
The difference between the two approaches is many thousands of dollars, 
typically.

That is the highest iteration of the T-IV motor and as such worth a bit of 
a premium to many when in safe and reliable condition. You should post your 
query to the vanagon_dot_com list, but the engine is little different than the 
last T-II's from '79.
