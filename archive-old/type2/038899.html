Subject: Going Cross Country!!!

Hello all,

im bran new to the list!  My girlfriend and I have been planning a cross
country trip for a couple of months now and are planning to leave in
June.  We will be doing alot of camping and backpacking so we wanted to
get some insight or suggestions as to the essential things we would need
to take with us.  Not only for the bus but for ourselves as well.  We
plan to travel for awhile and have become overwhelmed with the things we
are taking with us.  We also have our two dogs, so suggestions for them
would also be appreciated.  Again any advice from anyone who has done
this or traveled for awhile would be fantastic! Thanks for the help and
the insight
