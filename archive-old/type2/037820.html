Subject: Exhaust Afterburning and AVP

Hi All,
    I'm in the middle of replacing the #3,4 head on an 1800, '74 with an AVP 
rebuild. I found a good bit of info on plugging the air injection ports in 
the archives; thanks Joe and Seth. What's had me stumped is that both holes 
have a threaded steel insert in the outboard fin similiar to the rear hole 
(temp sensor?) in the original head. Peering up into the exhaust ports I can 
see that both #3 and #4 are ported for air injection. At first I thought it 
might have been a 1700 head, ie four air holes, but the part # 021101371S 
makes me believe it came from an 1800 right side. I insert my long baby 
phillips, both holes appear to be blocked somewhere deep in the head. The air 
pump is long gone so I don't think this will be a problem, but it makes me 
wonder... Has anyone had a similiar experience with a rebuilt head?
