Subject: Dual Carbs on a 2.0L, Brake Booster Vacuum line

OK, Here's the shit-uation...  I've got a '72 camper that I recently put a 
2.0L engine and trans out of a '79 and swaped it over to dual carbs (36 
Webers).  My question is how to hook up the brake booster vacuum line.  The 
manifolds I have, have already been tapped for a booster line, but only in 
one barrel on either side of the engine.  The engine runs fine off-idle, but 
it backfires and sputters and eventually dies at idle.  I'm assuming that 
the booster line has something to do with it as when I plug/pinch off the 
lines it idles just fine.  Is there a special type of hose to use to prevent 
it from colapsing from the vacuum? (I'm using 1/2&quot; fuel hose right now) Do I 
need to tap into all 4 barrels?  Suggestions, comments, questions welcome.  
Thanks
