Subject: Re: [T2] Tire shop apes broke my bus (long)

Actually, the moral is that if you need to have someone else touch your 
bus, make sure it's an owner-proprietor if you can help it. Employees, 
especially at chains, don't get paid well enough to care. And nothing 
in our culture today promotes pride in workmanship. But 
owner-proprietors know which side of the bread gets buttered.

I tend to get angry and resentful about any task that I can't see to 
myself. Smog and safety inspections cause dread for weeks in advance, 
not because I fear a failed inspection but because someone is going to 
have to get their grubby mitts on my bus. And in the case of smog, a 
visit once every two years is not often enough.

The other possible moral to the story is that if you can find an 
owner-proprietor who changes and balances tires, does inspections, and 
so on, make an effort to get to know him -- have him do some work that 
you could do yourself, find out his kid's names and ask about them 
every time you go in, that sort of thing.

Also, its pretty easy in most places in the country to find someone who 
can do work for you who is also bus-friendly. But you've got to find 
out who that person is.

Yesterday, I went out to get a wiper blade for my VW GTI. The clerk 
looked up the number for the right blades, selected two boxes, and then 
insisted on walking out to the car with me to make sure which one fit 
before selling it to me. This was at an Auto Zone. Why? Because the guy 
thinks that GTIs are &quot;the bomb.&quot;

We all like to save a buck or two, but price alone is the dumbest 
criterion for choosing someone to do work for you.
