Subject: Re: stickers/cops (longish)

your story is quite disheartening.

however, i notice a trend among people who have cop vs bus stories.  it
seems like the cops harass us a bit, but in the end let us move along;
perhaps they realise the inherent stupidity of their actions after
speaking with the drivers.  is this correct; has anyone had a truly bad
experience?

my little story reinforces my theory, but is still a bit scary.

two friends and i were recently in idaho for a backpacking trip.  we
left a taco bell parking lot around 9pm and were pulled over within
seconds--no headlights (damn that other pull switch right beside the
headlight one!).  the cop then said 'license and registration'.  i did
not have my registration, since in GA i am not required to carry it
(right?), and he seemed pacified by that explanation.
    however, he then asked the other two people in the van for _their_
identification as well!  we knew not what his reason for that was.  he
returned to his cruiser (with his spotlight pointed right into my
mirror, thus my eyes) and apparently sat for about 15 minutes.  
    in the end the cop said 'sorry for the delay, have a nice night',
and  gave us directions to the nearest KOA.  

my take on the issue is that as long as they dont do something truly
evil like fake a charge, or worse, i can deal with a little harassment.
