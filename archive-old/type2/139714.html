Subject: Re: [T2] The full report (long)

Mark,

I understand....maybe you *are* in the wrong universe&lt;grin&gt;.

Best yet, try and go to walmart and ask for a battery for a 1967 VW 
bug....same for all years I am sure....they no longer carry them!

And!  At the two other FLAPS in town, they are now $50+ .

Although I haven't checked with NAPA yet....hmmmm


Cheers, dave

&gt; Clerk (&quot;associate'): No, we don't carry that.
&gt; 
&gt; Me: Know anyone who does?
&gt; 
&gt; Clerk: No, I don't. It's not too popular.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Every exchange I have in a store goes like that. Nothing, and I mean 
&gt; nothing, that I own or like or use is &quot;popular.&quot; My vehicle isn't 
&gt; popular, the engine in it isn't popular, my computers aren't popular, 
&gt; the cigarettes I smoke are really unpopular, the bikes I ride aren't 
&gt; popular. Nothing I do, think, eat, use, enjoy, consume, or say is 
&gt; popular.
&gt; 
&gt; I'd rather chew on ground glass than to have another store clerk, 
&gt; anywhere, remind me that I live in an alternative (and unpopular) 
&gt; universe.
