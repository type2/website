Subject: Spark plug Blow out+ACEAIQAh-

Hello fellow List members,
     Hope all had a great weekend. I had a great time at the dead of winter
campout put on by the Peachstate Tranporters out of Atlanta,GA. Thanks guys
it was a blast. Now to the point of my email. My bus, a 68 westy with a
single port stock 1600, was driving along wonderfully making it up the
mountain roads with no problem. I was going up hill around 45mph. I decided
to down shift the bus into third  as she was starting to lug a bit. The
milli-second I put my foot on the clutch it sounded as if I had lost my
exhaust. I pulled into a driveway and got pointed down hill as I shut her
down. Looking around the engine compartment I notice the spark plug wire
hanging out at the +ACM-1 cylinder. I felt the plug and it came right out in my
hand. Using a CD case as a mirror I saw the threads were chewed to bits and
a nice gash to match the one on my spark plug. The rest of the story ends
with a trip to find a heli (not sure of the spelling) coil and the tools to
install it with. I got weird looks at the autozone and other little part
store in the area. I ended up renting a Uhaul to my baby home. Now heres my
questions. 1. What caused this type thing to happen? 2. What other damage
could come from this? 3. Whats the best fix now that she is home in the
drive way?
