Okaley-dokely folx, next time you get a tyre changed (NO F.A.R.T.S PLEASE) &amp;
they say &quot;you need all 5 wheels changed&quot;. Of course you just laugh &amp; just
get the one.

Last year, I got 1 new tyre &amp; was told the above, having got 4 spares in the
garage, all 'C' rated I just ignored him &amp; got the one changed &amp; asked for
him to swap front to rear on that side.
Any-way, I have a habit of ALWAYS slackening the nuts AS SOON AS I GET HOME,
then tightening them with the wrench I would use on the road. This I did &amp;
all was OK, yesterday I put Mr Whipy on big stands &amp; removed all the wheels,
but when I got to the wheel I had asked him to swap the nuts were on %^&amp;*ing
tight!
 So I got the air wrench out NOT A BUDGE! Now I start remembering that I saw
the truck air gun by that wheel when he swapped, the nuts were put on over
tight out of spight. Hmm, can't go back so I'll get the cheater bar out (we
call them breaker bars), regular flavour 'snap-on' socket snapped! So I find
a impact socket again 'snap-on', 1 nut comes off, but the next one snaps the
impact!

The long &amp; the short of it was that the 'snap-on' guy, couldn't believe that
his regular socket could snap, let alone an impact. So he got out a 500 lbs.
torque wrench &amp; 4 impact 19mm sockets. Every nut was considerably off the
500 scale &amp; each socket was good for 1 nut then it would break! I didn't
have to pay for the sockets etc. But I did buy my mechanic 1 regular &amp; 1
impact 19mm socket to replace the ones I had broken.

Just goes to show &quot;Trust no-one&quot;
