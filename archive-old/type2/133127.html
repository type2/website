Subject: Re: [T2] my lectrical problem (hypothesis test)

Colby,

No engine that has a coil will ever run without one.

No coil, no spark.....


I have had a *flaps* 1 year old coil die as I was backing out of the 
driveway, so it can happen.  Put in a spare bosch and haven't had a 
problem  in last 4 years.

Cheers, dave

Has anyone ever had an ignition coil go out on them? What are the symptoms? 
For as far as I know, an engine can run without one as long as you have 
an alternate way of starting it...am I right? Could this be my problem?

&gt; Again...thanks,
