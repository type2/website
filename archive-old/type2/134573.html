Hi Mark. One of the things that this engine went through was that when 
I first built it, I neglected to set the endplay on the flywheel. This 
sheared the bolts holding the fan -- a couple of times, before I got 
religion and pulled the engine to correct the endplay. I wonder whether 
the same event could have weakened the rivets? Or started the 
elongation of the holes in the gear?

A few thousand miles separated the flywheel event from the loss of cam.
