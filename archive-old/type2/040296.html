Ron:
Overheating problem:
verify accurate ignition timing.
check thermostat when cold,
and proper valve adjustment.

Brake problem:
bad ball joints will do it,
or warped rotors, or
incorrect rear shoe adj.
(would pull harder in one
direction, not both).
is the steering box ok?
have you been drinking *~* ?!

Noise:
broken motor mounts,
loose fan housing, causing
fan rub noise.
loose cv bolts.
does it sound like an engine
or drivetrain noise?
