Subject: Re: [T2] Missing engine parts.

Close up all of the heater system - you are loosing cooling air to the 
outside air. You can overheat your bus this way.

Also I would recommend that you ensure all of the cooling tin is on the 
bottom of the engine.

Replace the engine to body seal and the engine lid seal.

That way you are not recirculating the heated air off of the bottom of your 
exhaust or air that has already been used once to cool the engine (already 
hot air).

&gt;Hey everyone, I am going through my engine compartment trying to figure out
&gt;what parts I am missing. I have the Muir book, but it isnt exaclty totally
&gt;clear on the &gt; 1972 bus engine compartment. I guess I need a picture of a
&gt;stock compartment with all the doo-hickeys in place. Also, will the Bentley
&gt;be more descriptive of the engine compartment? Specifically I think that most
&gt;of my heater system is missing.
&gt;
&gt;My photo_album site has some pictures of the engine compartment.

&gt;Thanks in advance.
