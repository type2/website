&gt; In my book, 15&quot; is a minimum at idle and I like to see 17-18&quot;.  I keep

Thanks for the great info, I like the chart.  After starting the bus
up last night (allowed gasket maker to cure around throttle body), my
reading was about 15&quot; and it would regularly drop 1-2&quot;, then come back
up.  According to the chart, this is &quot;burned valve&quot; or &quot;plug not firing&quot;.
I doubt it is the former, since I replaced both the heads &lt;100 miles ago.
I'll try troubleshooting the spark tonight.

&gt; All these sound good.  In addition, head out to a scientific supply store
&gt; or old-fashioned hobby shop (do these even exist any more???) and buy a
&gt; supply of rubber stoppers.  Stopper everthing coming off the &quot;big hose&quot;
&gt; and the air dist box (decel valve, brake booster, crancase vent, etc. etc.
&gt; and see if that helps.  If it does not, then it's the manifold to block
&gt; gaskets or the big hoses from the runner to the air dist box.  If it does,
&gt; start adding accesories one at a time until you find the one that is
&gt; leaking.

Good idea to stopper everything.  Can I stopper the aux air regulator?
Doesn't this require air flow at startup time?  It is my understanding
that this provides extra air at startup and closes after the engine warms
up.

If it comes down to the manifold boots or manifold-to-head gaskets, can I
replace these without dropping the engine?  This could be tricky...
