Subject: Re: [T2] bleeding brakes by oneself

Hi Dave,

I would think that adding a check valve and hose clamp to the bleeder line
would make a system like this system pretty near infallable. With a check
valve in the line releasing the pedal would pull all new fluid from the
resevoir, and continue to force bubbles along the lines until they are all
gone. My usual system of a clear jar and a short length of fish-tank air
line works great, but only as long as I have an assistant to pump the pedal
and keep the resevoir topped up.

It's almost surprising that I haven't seen this offered in a kit. Not that
I'm a tool hound or anything, but that's something that could come in handy
when working on the bus alone. Or have I just missed it sitting there in the
bin blister-packed and ready to go???

Happy trails,

&gt; Denny,
&gt; 
&gt; Sorry, it is now Sunday, but yes, sometimes this method will work.
&gt; 
&gt; I have had good luck trying this as long as I used a bleeder cap to try
&gt; and close the pipe going back to the mc as soon as I got the hose off
&gt; also.  
&gt; 
&gt; Don't forget to lube the hose threads with brake fluid before installing!
&gt; 
&gt; Cheers, dave
