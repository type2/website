Subject: Regular vs Premium

Roconante ('72 Westy) has just returned from back-to-back trips; first from
East Texas to Mexico City and back then from East Texas to Las Vegas and
back.  6,040.1 miles in four weeks without any problems.

Wondering about using unleaded gasoline versus premium, I burned all Texaco
unleaded (87 octane) on the outbound trip to Las Vegas and then Texaco
premium (93 octane) on the return.  The gas out west was the winter mix of
gas and alcohol.  The results were thus:

Marshall, TX to Las Vegas: 1757.5 miles, 103.2 gallons, 17.0 mpg.
Las Vegas to Marshall, TX: 1649.3 miles, 106.1 gallons, 15.5 mpg.

There seemed to be no difference at all in temperature, power, etc.  There
is a substantial price difference between regular and premium though.

Does this mean I should be using the lower octane gasoline all the time?
