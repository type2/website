Subject: pressure regulator for eletric pump?
Message-ID: &lt;e60a81e8.245deb3a_at_aol_dot_com&gt;

Hello,

I have a 1972 Westy with 1700cc pancake engine and twin weber carbs, I 
ordered the eletric fuel pump kit to replace my mechanical, has anyone else 
that has done this, and where can I buy a pressure regulator?  Is there a 
cut-off switch that I need also to keep the pump from trying to fill the bowl 
when its full, i have no idea what i'm doing, please help me out.

Thanks,
Shawn
