&gt; &gt;&gt;When customers admire the convertible on the showroom floor, just point out
&gt; &gt;&gt;that you can't get most of the parts needed for that car at the same dealer
&gt; &gt;&gt;the car is sitting in.
&gt; 
&gt; How many Ford dealers have in stock all parts necessary to assemble a 72
&gt; that have been NLA for 20 years? Do they have all the parts in stock to
&gt; assemble a 2000 model? Or maintenance parts only? It is not logical to put
&gt; in stock parts which will sit for several years before the high milage
&gt; examples finally begin needing them. That's just wasting space for storage
&gt; and drives up costs. The low volume parts are at the regional warehouses

HOWEVER Heinz Nordhoff REQUIRED every VW dealership to keep in stock 2 of
every part made by VW in order to remain a VW dealership.  In fact I date
the beginning of the end of VW (as we knew it) with the day he retired

&gt; If VW does not defend their name and logo, the law says &quot;who cares, not

no argument with defending their name and logo, but some companies have a
&quot;nominal&quot; license fee for using the logo in non competitive circumstances

for example, in Model Railroading, all those toy trains have logo's from
various companies plastered on the sides,   The Model Hobby Dealers Assoc
have worked out a token $1 fee for a 25 year license on the use of the
logo's from the various Railroads.  This protects the logo but allows
hobbiest to also get the accuracy they desire

&gt; us&quot;. Look at the stink Ford raised with body repair shops who used
&gt; aftermarket parts and called it the same as a Ford. They won when logo was
&gt; not at issue, only a suggestion that aftermarket imitations were 'as good
&gt; as' or met Ford specifications when it could be shown in many cases they
&gt; did not. 

I would be upset if the part was &quot;passed off&quot; as VW and it wasn't,
myself.  If I go to RMMW or any of the others and by  NOS, I know it is
genuine VW, just not very new,  etc.  all I want is truth in advertising,
and I will make up my own mind as to weather I want DM parts or &quot;Good
enough&quot; is good enough...and that usually varies by use too.  if I hang
&quot;fuzzy dice&quot; from the rear view mirror they can be brand &quot;X&quot; for all I
care. but where it counts I want DM
