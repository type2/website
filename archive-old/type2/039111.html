Subject: Jump Starting with a Deep Cycle Batt

George, hate to disagree with you, but jump starting from a marine or 
standard deep cycle will not damage the batt. All boats, with multi-batt 
systems, usually have a switch( generically called a Perko or Guest switch, 
after the popular makers of the same) that allows you to cycle between all 
batts(including deep cycle, or &quot;house&quot; batts, as they are known in the 
industry) depending on circumstance. I've owned all sorts of watercraft over 
the years, and am also a factory certified master marine tech., and can tell 
you from experience that I've never destroyed or even shortened the life span 
of a deep cycle batt. by  occasionally requesting it to act as a cranker 
batt.Every batt. maker that I've talked to(and I've talked to them all, 
nothing is as short lived as a batt used for marine application, with the 
exception of a customers temper, who just shelled out mucho bucks for a new 
batt last season, only to find it kaput at the begining of this one) have 
stated that using a deep cycle as an occasional cranker will not harm the 
batt, and is in fact, par for the course. Now pounding the hell out of a wet 
cell deep cycle batt. while running through high seas is a completly 
different can 'O worms...
