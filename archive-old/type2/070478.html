Subject: Re: Bumpers ideas

interesting someone told me a story about how their bus was _saved_ because
they *did not* have a 
rear bumper. The bus was hit reasonable hard in the rear. Their thinking was
that if the bumper had 
been on there it wuld have twisted the frame and rendered the bus junk (due
to the fact that the 
bumper is bolted right into the ladder frame underneath)

anyone's thoughts on the matter would be apreciated
- - - -
i think that someone is a few fries short of a happy meal.   the bus would
have to be smacked really hard for the frame to be messed up, and it would be
worse for the rear/motor without a bumper.
