Subject: Re: silver socket

I won't claim to know the *original* function of the silver socket, BUT I
do know that it's identical to the accessory sockets used on BMW
motorcycles and early BMW cars... male plugs to fit the socket are
available at BMW motorcycle dealers, and I think both the sockets
and plugs are available directly through Bosch.

If I ever get cold enough (not likely here in California, and my Bus'
heater works pretty well anyway) I can always plug my heated motorcycle
vest into the socket on the Bus' dashboard ;-)  mmmmmmm, toasty!
