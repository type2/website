Jon,
I'm not sure about the fuel injection part but the only thing that I have
ever seen cause this problem is a ground short or an open in the primary
side of the ignition system. Especially new defective points or condenser.

Replace the points and condenser. Replace/repair all 12v ignition wiring
that looks like it could be touching ground and shorting out or possibly
broken wire inside. Try a different coil.

The primary side of the ignition is the low voltage side of the ignition
coil ie everything 12 volts.
