&gt; Marty,

If your going to just replace the curtain there is no need to remove the whole closet!!  Why work harder than you have to.  You can loosen the closet, put a board in to hold the upper tray up, and then tip the closet away from the window.  This allows you to get at the wing nuts that hold the board with the curtain on it.  Slid the board out and let the wife work her magic!
   Peace, Love, and don't forget to wash the inside of the                                  window!
