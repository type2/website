&gt;&gt;Hey List:
&gt;&gt;I was wondering what the listees out there use for
&gt;&gt; a bike rack?
&gt;

I tow a boat regularly, and the towhitch mount wasn't an option for me.

I also don't like the spare wheel mounts as they obscure your view and 
your headlights. Plus, that spare isn't really mounted to a load-bearing 
surface.

Driving a Pop-top left me pretty much with only one option.

I drilled holes through the top of the rear hatch (above the window) and 
bolted two fork clamps through the door. The back wheels of the bikes 
simply bungee to the rear bumper.

I've had this setup for over 2 years now with no problem.

Getting into the engine bay is possible by un-bungeeing (is that a word?) 
the bikes and they can swing to the side while you open the deck lid. 
(need help with two bikes though).

(i also have 2 more fork mounts that go on a peice of plywood in the 
luggage rack on the roof if I really have to carry 4 bikes)
