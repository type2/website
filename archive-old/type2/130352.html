&gt;T-4s have
&gt;o-rings, which &quot;roll&quot; a little bit to seal. If you silicone the crap out of

&gt;stop rolling in the head and case bores, and it will start leaking.

For that reason oil is the best installation lubricant and nothing else should go on.

I wanted to recant some advice I left in the archives. I've recently found out that Dow Corning 111 Valve Lubricant &amp; Sealant isn't a good idea to use on the o-rings. Some porche engine builders use it but I've found out that it will shrink Viton 5% and cause regular silicone o-rings to swell.
