Subject: &quot;Chirring&quot; clutch solved-failed relined Sachs!

Well, I finally pulled the 221K miles engine for the 2nd time in its
life because I finally couldn't shift when pushing clutch pedal in-
drove it home 1o miles using no clutch and starting at stops in first
gear!  Had a bit of trouble separating the engine- can you spell lying
under the bus beating on the u-tubes with both feet to push it from the
trans?   Well, the &quot;chirring&quot; noise and occaisional &quot;grabbing&quot; wasn't
the pilot bearing-
   The clutch disk had 70K on it, put in after 150K on the
original...and from its appearance, it may have had separated linings
for quite a while, perhaps even after I went 3,000 mi across country in
'95 and noticed the &quot;grabbing&quot; when clutch was in and I started engine
in gear.  I took a pic of how it looks, can send to anyone asking.  I
got it from Savich's in Philly, and the irony is he first sent me an
asian clutch, and I drove down there to get a Germ?an one- a Sachs, but
it's stamped Assy in Canada - a reline job (sorry you guys north of the
border).....Obviously the disk was spinning independently of the
linings, and the pressure plate is really dished out where the exposed
lining plates rubbed it.
Never woulda thought this- there was never a burning smell of slipping
clutch.  The chirring noise may have been slipping or noise of the metal
on metal, and lack of clutching finally was due to the buildup of the
lining particulates not allowing the trans shaft to rest.  Got a lot of
cleaning to do....MB
