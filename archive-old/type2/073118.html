I think we have settled on #buslist as a constant.

We now have a working channelbot. If you are a regular and you want +o
automatically, please type the following when you enter the channel:

/msg zippy hello

This introduces you to the Zippy the bot so he will create a user record
for you. Then I can set it to auto-op you.

If that made no sense to you, don't worry about it, just get an IRC client
from your favorite software archive and tell it to connect to irc-2.mit_dot_edu
#buslist. Have fun!
