, and the engine is re-built just six months ago...It has three colors: B=
lue, White, and Rust...Well, really the rust is not that bad...And with s=
ome love and time, it will look Super Sano! BTW, does anyone know if they=
 make a fiberglass front end piece?? That is where the rust is at its wor=
se...If I have too, I'll just get the body done....
