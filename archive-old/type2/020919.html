Re paper shim between flywheel and crank:
OK, by your test it crushed 60%- so 3 thou paper will go down 1.8 thou-
so if I get endplay with 4 10-11 thou shims and paper under the flywheel
to 3 thou total or even 2 thou, it will still be in spec increasing by
1.8 thou with crushed paper- but 5 bolts holding flyhwheel will be
looser?- yet with gland nut and 71 flywheel, there is a paper shim over
the 4 dowels under the flywheel- and you check endplay with like 245 ft
lbs of torque.  No concern over later crushing.  Hmm- 250 divided by 5
is 50, you torque the 5 bolts on the later cranks to 80 ft lbs each,
that's more than with a glaqnd nut.  I can check torque after a
day.........
