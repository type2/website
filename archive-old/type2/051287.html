&gt; What should one look for in a trailer and hitch for a bus?

Hey there Terry,

Trailers can be had from various places, Harbor Freight, Home depot,
local trailer shops, or from a local want ad classified mag.

Da'lan makes a hitch for the late 70's buses. Details can be found in
the archives. (Look for the posts from JonR). I've included a link to
those posts below.

Hope this helps,
