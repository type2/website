&gt;tell if is real or just a bit of alumium.  anyone know what this part is or
&gt;does?  it's two what look like vacuum nipples where not attached to
&gt;anything.  it is/was located top of the block partially hidden under the
&gt;intake runners.

I believe is a temperature switch vacuum cutoff combo for the auto transmission.
