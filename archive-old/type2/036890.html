Subject: auto tranny parts

Well I had fun today. I had a small tranny leak on the driveway from my 73
auto Westy. I crawled under to see that it was coming from where the filler
tube goes into the pan. I start to tighten the nut and something breaks and
fluid pours all over the driveway.
I think I need a new pan and the nut part that screws into it.
Can anyone out there help me out.
