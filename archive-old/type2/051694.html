&gt;&gt; Try 110 v. welders, with and without inert gas.Thank the man, and then
go buy
&gt;&gt; it
&gt;&gt; at Harbor Freight .

Although I'm a known supporter of the big HF, you want to avoid them
on welders, for the service issue.  Also cause they'll start talking about
things like an additional $100 for a 1 year wattanty and stuff like that.

In this it pays to go local, but don't get screwed.  In BFNW Cumberland
Maryland I could buy the same Lincoln (not a particularly good welder
BTW in the cheapo lines) MIG that Eastwood sold, local for $50 less, and
you could deal even more.  And they got parts local.  I ended up with a
Century (also not great in the sub $500 range but I liked the feed mech
more than the lincoln) on sale for $350 or so (6 years ago) at Quality Farm
and Fleet, they still got parts.  A total FWIW on the utter cheap, I was
wondering through local Ace hardware last weekend and they had a flux
core for $180 and a MIG for $270, it didn't look half bad, especially at
that price.  Using a MIG is what you make of it, I've seen a good welder
take mine and do things I could never sucessfully do.  He did it every day
for a living and used a crappy $200 thing at home.  It makes sense to
buy the MIG, you'll cuss the flux core in the end.

Make sure it takes full size spools whatever you buy, and get a new tank
from HF or whoever is cheapest, mine is a midsize thing I really like only
about 2 feet tall, I'd never seen the size local.
