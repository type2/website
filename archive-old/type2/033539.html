okay, myabe i have misunderstood something here....

higher altitude=less oxygen per liter of air.  So i thought, when one goes
to high altitude you need to _lean_ out the mixture as the higher you go
the ammount of fuel metered stays constant, but the oxygen content
decreases as you ascend.  then, logically, one would need to lean out the
carb to match the changed oxygen content of the air.  

less air+same ammount of gas=too rich???

let me know if i am wrong because i have advised a friend to lean out his
carb if he runs bad at high altitude and i want to give him the straight
scoop if i goofed.

thanks,

Steve
