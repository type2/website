Subject: Re: Leaking Cover Gasket

&gt; I've had a few gaskets slip over the years, so I learned this trick from 
&gt; another trusted mechanic.  Seal the gasket to the valve cover.  Clean the 
&gt; cover good and put down a good even layer of your favorite sealer.  I think I 
&gt; used the orange RTV stuff.  After the sealer gets tacky, press the gasket in 
&gt; place and install.
&gt; 
&gt; I've used this method for the past 15 years on several air cooled vws and it 
&gt; works great.  Your gasket will never slip.  It also helps your gasket last 
&gt; longer, and you can still adjust your valves as the gasket is only sealed on 
&gt; one side.

Fel-Pro. The single best bit of advice (thanks george) ive gotten. They
make a neoprene valve cover gasket. Ive had the same ones on for over a
year on a daily driver. they survived all the valve adjustments and still
dont leak. No sealer used at all. I never had a cork set survive a single
valve adjust well.
