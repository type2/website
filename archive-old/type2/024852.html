As I can't seem to get unsubscribed from this list....
On the question of auto transmissions
73-75(74?) used the old &quot;Type 3&quot; gearbox with a &quot;bus only&quot; final drive. this 
has the vacuum modulator on the back edge of the pan area...the later 
autoboxes are the same as the rabbit..it uses a totally mechanical shift 
system. the linkage on these are on the right hand side of the car. the later 
vanagons use the same unit with the addition of an oil cooler at the front of 
the case..You can use the &quot;waterboxer&quot; unit in an air-cooled vanagon and just 
not hook up the coolant lines (if you *find* coolant lines on your 
air-cooled, you got trouble!) I've put the aircooled trannies in the 
waterboxer..What I'm *not* sure of is if you can install the waterboxer type 
in a late &quot;loaf&quot;..clearance for the cooler between the mount and/or body is 
the issue.
You *should* be able to put a late loaf tranny in a 73 but you will likely 
need to change all the linkage...
It is possible you use the rabbit automatic *section* on the late van final 
drive...split the units apart, remove the rabbit governor drive and replace 
it with the plate from the van, remove the valve body to allow you to change 
the shift linkage bits...change pans and either leave or remove and plug the 
rabbit dipstick tube...reassemble and install..yer in!
