Sounds like a vacuum leak.  Maybe at the carburetor itself.

&gt; Ok , so I was looking through my bently and trying to
&gt; remember the instructions on adjusting the carb and
&gt; what does what. Its been so long since Ive had to fool
&gt; with one that I have forgotten how to work on it.
&gt; Anyways, something strange i noticed was that the
&gt; motor kept the same idle with the idle mixture screw
&gt; all the way in and 3 turns out. If I remember
&gt; correctly it should reduce the idle the further in I
&gt; screw it . Is that correct? If I screw it all the way
&gt; in the motor should stall ?  The carb is a Solex
&gt; 30/31. I Have not had this truck but a few months and
&gt; the carb was sposto have been rebuilt by a local shop
&gt; before i got it. 
&gt; Thanks----Bryan
