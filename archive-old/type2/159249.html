Subject: Re: [T2] Re: Ign Switch

The key goes into a lock, the bottom of the lock turns an electrical 
switch. When the contacts in the electrical switch goes bad you get 
symptoms like you describe - not being able to get good contact in the 
&quot;run&quot; position (must hold the key), twist extra hard for the start 
function, etc.

You need to replace the electrical part. Our bus list supplkiers all 
have it and NAPA had my '97 VW Cabrio when I was in a pinch last year. 
It is visually identical to my '78 Westy's switch - didn't compare numbers.

I pulled the steering wheel b/c there simply wasn't enough room to slide 
the switch out the bottom. There was also a hidden screw that would have 
prevented that anyhow. Pull the wire pigtails off the bottom, loosen the 
column to dash bolts, remove the steering wheel, pull the signal lever 
and wiper level upwards to remove, pull the column towards you to lift 
off the plastic column trim cover, remove the pinch bolt, pull the lock 
housing off, replac ehte lock. That is the basic version of what is in 
the Bentley. I'd DEFINITELY look at the Bentley. &lt;griN!&gt;

Hope that helps.
