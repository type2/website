Subject: hyd lifter workings

Gang,

I've broken down my solid lifter'd 2.0L and seen how the cam followers/pushrods work, but never my hydraulic lifter'd bus.

Please correct me where I go astray in my guessing:

There's still a cam follower, but it's different (why?)
Is there no pushrod in there, just oil pushing the valves open?
What/how is the device pushing the rocker arms?

Just want to know how this hydraulic system works.

Billy
