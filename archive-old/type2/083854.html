Subject: Re: [T2] starting fluid

The fact that WD-40 is starting any engine is not the product, but the
propellant---

Your looking at propane blast to fire the dead beast-----not the
slippery stuff.

Thias is why WD-40 is an excellent fuel for potato cannon's--the propane
makes them spud's really fly---- 

Later,

Terry

You can use starting fluid on a diesel, but you must have a starting
fluid injection kit on the engine. Just squirting it into the air intake
from a can, like you do on a gas engine, will blow the engine up. 
??? I owned a bus company and we had up to 17 buses, it gets pretty cold
around these parts and we used cases of starting fluid all winter and we
just sprayed it into the air cleaner. =A0 never did damage any of those
old Detroit's that I'm aware of. and these were &quot;MY&quot; buses so I didn't
want em damaged as I would have to pay for the repair. 
You can punch a 2&quot; hole in a VW 15/1600 diesel piston using ether as
starting fluid. On Bob's big ole Detroit diesel's maybe not, but it
isn't wise for most car diesels. There is a wonderfully safe
alternative, WD-40 will start and run a VW diesel quite nicely, ideally
a warm can of WD-40 that aerosolizes well but not critical. In high
school I drove the '76 bus or a '78 diesel Rabbit with about 250k miles
on it, in WV in the winter WD-40 or a hill were my best friends. And on
real cold nights at 1:00 am after closing at Ponderosa there was always
getting a friend to bumper me around the parking lot till I could start
it when I ran out of the WD-40 or didn't want to stand outside in the
30mph wind.
