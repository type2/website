&gt; &gt; there's legislation under consideration which would drastically raise
&gt; &gt; the taxes on gasoline over the next 6 years, as coupled with other 
&gt; &gt; programs to gently prod (v|f)olks towards more enviro-friendly transport.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Sure, electric is one solution, but at present, it's not a long-distance
&gt; &gt; (700+ mile roadtrip) solution -- at least not until there are more
&gt; &gt; charging stations nationwide.

well some years ago I tried (key word tried) to electrify a 71 I owned
when it threw a rod.......needless to say the complexity of it is a lot
more than meets the eye.   I was ending up pileing the entire area between
the axles with batteries and the engine with a 12hp fork lift
motor...never did get it to run worth _at_#&amp;$*.   of course that was before
the reasonable avaliablity of solid state controls so now it would be
muchh easier and cheaper, but rebuilding a two liter is still cheaper by
comparison.
