Subject: Spark plug blew out of head

Hello All,
Help, and please tell me all will be ok and relatively inexpensive, even
if you have to lie to me.
Spark plug on number 2 cylinder blew out around Memorial day.  No
problem, I put it back in.  Today she blew again.  This time a thread
was stripped and would not tighten.  Had Happy towed home, now what? 
Hopefully a new plug will do the trick, however I don't feel that
lucky.  Why would this happen in the first place?  How much damage may I
have created by continuing to drive?  Would the exhaust leak have
anything to do here?
TIA
