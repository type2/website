Subject: Re: [T2] Cigarette lighter in my 69 Transporter?

Paul:

This is the same one I bought a few months ago.  I also use mine for cell-phone charging.  The red lead goes to 12V, and the terminal on the body of the lighter goes to ground.  You should use an in-line fuse with the 12V lead, and connect it to a 12V source that gets switched on and off by the ignition switch.

Any further questions, e-mail me.

&gt;Dear List:
&gt;
&gt;I'm thinking of buying a cigarette lighter for my bus&gt;&gt;One question:  the little push-on clip at the end of the wire?  Where would/should/could I attach
&gt;that?  I'm kind of a dope when it comes to wiring...
&gt;
&gt;Any ideas would be a big help!
