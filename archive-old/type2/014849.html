Subject: timing scale from a distant galaxy.....???and other Q's??
Message-ID: &lt;2b2bc5db.247b3280_at_aol_dot_com&gt;

Today while diagnosing some timing problems, some of which are related to the 
dizzy some not.....i have come to a couple revelations.  I hope some can help 
shed some light on these to see if I am thinking this thru correctly.

first----my timing scale to the left of the fan is definitely from another 
planet!!!
the zero on the scale is actually about 25-30 btdc.  tdc for me (i found this 
by pulling a spark plug and finding out when the piston is at the top of its 
stroke AND by comparing that info with checking to see when the intake and 
exhaust valves open and close)...when i found tdc, it lined up PERFECTLY in 
two different areas.  the first was the notch on the face of the pulley 
pointed straight up.  dead perfect!!  the second place it correlated too, was 
in the top timing hole the *O* lined up PERFECTLY in the *v* notch.  soooo, 
my scale seems to me to be of no use.  
i am still a bit confused about where to time it but i am getting closer from 
info from the archives and fellow list members.

second-----i have been hunting for a dizzy that fit my engine correctly.  i 
NEED a dual vac. dizzy.  it is to go on a *EA* engine which is a 411 motor 
&gt;from 1972.  i have found two used dizzys that are correct according to their 
numbers, BUT the vac. retard diaphragm seems to not work.  the vac. advance 
moves correctly and holds vac.  shouldn't the vac retard do the same??

third-------does anyone have a good working dual vac. element that I could 
swap onto my dizzy??  ( if that is possible)...otherwise I would like to 
purchase a correct one.
