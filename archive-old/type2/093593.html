This is too bad.  I expended a huge effort getting my Canadian bus into the states AFTER I knew what a pain it was and I bet they will tighten the regulations and the result may well make it impossible to bring a Canadian bus down.  All because of the stupid exchange rate.

&gt;Huge price differences exist between similar models sold in the USA

&gt;they have to pay for it from the US distributor.
