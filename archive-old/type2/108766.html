Subject: Re: [T2] Carb Mixture- I checked my distributor

I went out and checked my distributor. I don't know them by sight, so I
wrote down the numbers stamped in the side.
JFUD 4
0231168 005
021906 205P

Also, I checked the lean idle (I think that's what it's called).It was
turned tight all the way in. I turned it about 1/4 turn out and the engine
started getting rough. Idle when engine is warmed up is about 900-950. I
have a 11/2 paper filter on top. It's looking a little dirty.

Air filter? Fuel filter? And, as some one else mentioned.  What dizzy are
you using with this 2.l engine?

The 009 dizzy/distributor is notorious for having this hesitation.

&gt;  I have a single Weber progressive on my 78 2.l in a 76 Westy. I have
&gt; hesitation in low RPM range, but it picks up nicely once the RPMs
increase.
&gt; What can I do to remedy this?
&gt;
&gt;  All others factors are ok (timing, valves, etc)
&gt; I don't have the cash right now to upgrade to dual carbs, and I don't have
&gt; the resources to go back to FI.
&gt;
&gt;  Thanks,
&gt;
&gt;  Nik
