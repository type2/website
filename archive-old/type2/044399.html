No comment... waiting for George.

&gt; &gt; Second, the engine is noisier than you think!  Do not be shocked at how
&gt; &gt; loud it sounds with the cover off :-)
&gt; 
&gt; and how!  took putting the cover back on to convince me the engine was not
&gt; blowing up!

Don't it tho!  When we were first testing the engine in the '80, we ran it
up to 55 on the highway... dared not go any faster because I was *sure*
the engine was going to blow up!!! I was deathly afraid that my '80
aircooled had accidentally gotten a diesel trans in it!
