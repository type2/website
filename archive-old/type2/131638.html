Subject: RE: [T2] Re:how to clean up used fridge/sink

&gt;From: &quot;Kathy and Paul&quot; Install the sink unit, fill the water tank and then 
&gt;add a few DROPS of
&gt;the clorox.   Now go drive around for 30 minutes and then drain and
&gt;flush the tank until there is no more smell of the clorox.


You might want to cycle some of the water through the pump as well just to 
make sure there is no boogers hiding in there.
