Subject: Re: [T2] Throttle Positioner sought

  Do you still have the original German duel arm carb on it? Also are the mounting bracket and the pull arm still there? 
If yes to all of these questions, I more then likely have some good used ones. If you have the Borosol K Cal duel arm 
carb they have a plastic pull off, if you have the original German Solex, it will have a meta one.

&gt;Okay, here's something neither bustedbus_dot_com nor Bus Depot have listed. 
&gt;Throttle Positioner for 1971 bus. It's part of the original emissions 
&gt;control and I want the Wonderbus to pollute as little as it did when 
&gt;sold new.
&gt;
&gt;If it makes a difference, the carb is a 34 PICT-3
