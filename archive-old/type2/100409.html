Subject: Re: [T2] Times they are a changeing

&gt;I hate to break it to every here, but according to this most of us are
&gt;geeks. (doesn't bother me a bit)


Maybe the Type2 list-server(s) should be stuffed into a bus, and hooked to a 
wireless access point, and it should be driven around while 'serving' us all 
with this enjoyable information exchange  :^)
That would be some serious Bus geekdom, eh?
