&gt; Hello,
&gt; What are the best brand of cv joints to buy?
&gt; Took apart trans-axle today.  Discovered bad cv joints.  Need to buy
new
&gt; one and wanted to get some advice on which ones are the best.

The originals are Lobro brand, and I really haven't seen any other
brands out there (though there are liable to be!)

I've found that minor pitting of the balls isn't much of an indicator
of failure coming soon.  During a &quot;poor&quot; cycle, I reinstalled a
&quot;questionable&quot; pair of CVs that has pretty obvious pitting on the
balls and they are still in service five years later.  I carry a spare
CV and boot kit so I can change them on the road if I have to, but I
haven't had to yet!  I don't intend to change them until they start
making noise!
