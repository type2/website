Subject: Re: [T2] Good Starter Advice.....Bosch vs.....FLAPS cheapies

Mike Noble sends:

&gt; Moral of story:  I dont care who you get it from check it out before you
&gt; install it.....unless you need the practice of removing and installing a new
&gt; one.   And if you get the lifetime warrenty part and have to replace it
&gt; yourself in the future......when someone else needs help or
&gt; advice......volunteer assistance and cheer up their day.

If you're buying it from a FLAPS have them check it out before you walk out
the door with it. Many FLAPS have a big sign up: No return on electrical
parts. Even if they will take a starter back, it's a pain to haul it home,
hook it up to check it, find out it doesn't work, haul it back...Big FLAPS
like AutoZone, Checker, Pep Boys, et al, have starter/alternator test stands
and, especially if you go in at a quiet time, employees that are happy as
hell to test your new starter for you. Many of them work on their own cars
and they don't like hauling it home, hooking it up to check it and finding
out it doesn't work either.
