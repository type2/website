Subject: RE: front triangular window

Not disagreeing with the method Karl outlined, it is truly correct. I
however having had the exact same thing happen to me on Christmas Eve and
tackled the job a little differently. Depending upon the situation it may be
much easier.

If the metal bracket is in good shape and incurred no damage during the
assault, just carefully break the remaining glass out and using a small
screwdriver and needle nose pliers pick the rest of the glass out of the
seal. In my case the glass cracked into billions and billions of little
pieces so it was relatively easy to remove. Try to keep the glass pieces
from rotating sideways. This is where the needle nose help out. Wear eye
protection and gloves.

It took about 5 minutes to remove all the glass cleanly.

Remove the frame from the bone yard obtained replacement. This should be
considerably easier since you can bend the frame a little to remove it. Use
a little glycerin sparingly on the seal and the glass will slide right in.
After a while the glycerin dries out and glass is held in place very
securely. Glycerin can be obtained at craft stores that sell candle making
supplies and Wally World has it for moistening hands in the pharmaceutical
section

Just an alternative.

Good Luck
