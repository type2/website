Another neat trick is if you have one that you just cannot get off, take an
old 12mm (?) socket, slightly smaller than the outer diameter of the bolt
and tap it over the bolt with a hammer... then all you have to do is stick a
ratchet in the socket and turn the bolt right out...this is great if you don't
mind losing an old socket...

While turning the bolt with the hex key, put some vise-grips on the
outside and turn at the same time. This helped me...
