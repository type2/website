Subject: RE: [T2] Bus Depot baywindow sliding windows?

Assuming you mean the correct molded seals, as I was sold seals from you guys
that were claimed to be for this application (as well as others)

Can you weigh in officially on this 221-845-231B part number and what it's
for?

Billy

&gt; sliding side windows...the seals, however, remain available, and probably
will be for some time.
