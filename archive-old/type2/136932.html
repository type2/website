Subject: Re: [T2] Headlight Switch or wiring causing Power Drain

There alternator light is always on when the headlights are burning, it
seems that the battery is not getting charged on the drive home after work
each day because I have to charge it every night.

Like I wrote, I had the battery load tested and I had the alternator
tested on the bus.  When there is no load at idle, puts out 13.5 volts,
when revving and headlights on, puts out 12.5, then goes down from there.

Thanks for the help.

what is the original problem?

12.5 volts with the headlights on sitting at idle. Thats still charging,
maybe low, did you rev it up and see it you got more V?
