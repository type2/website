Subject: Re: [T2] Enigine hesitates, sputters and dies on highway.

My 78 has done that a couple of times.  I have learned
to take the T2 sensor wire and ground it out, removing
the T2 sensor from the circuit.  It doesn't run
perfectly, but it runs better, and will allow you to
drive home.
   
Your problem may differ, but your description sounds
familiar to me.  Also, the speed of problem on-set is
so sudden, it`s as if an electrical switch was flipped
off.  
   
Locally, someone else had the same problem you have
described, but her problem cause was her air flow
sensor flap was stuck partially open.   She had very
similar symptoms.
