I went through this process back in 2002.

&gt;Can someone point me in the right direction as to where I should
&gt;start?

If you are talking about bring a baywindow bus down there is a lot of documentation and red tape to read but much of it doesn't apply. In a nutshell, you fill in form HS-7 at the border crossing (take it along with you) and check off box 1.

http://www.nhtsa.dot_dot_gov/cars/rules/import/hs799short.pdf

This allows you to legally import your vehicle with minimal hassle. You can also drive your vehicle into the country and process the form at a regional customs office (airport, etc) but I recommend doing it at the border where they are accustomed  to the procedure.

Afterwards you have to deal with registration at the state level and it's usually just a matter of showing your title and the customs declaration form. When I lived in TX, for example, I also had to get the police to inspect the bus for stolen VIN/vehicle.

If the vehicle is less than 25 years old, it's more complicated: you require a compliance letter from VW and you might have to modify the vehicle to comply (speedometer in km is the common problem) with US regs.
