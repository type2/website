Hi folks
(I have re-sent this mail as it didn't appear the first time, if it is a   
duplicate I apologise and will kick my own butt)

1972 1600 dual port upright bus. (upright engine not bus, well the bus IS   
upright......oh you know what I mean!!)
With winter coming on here in the UK, the rebuild process is restricted   
to activities in the workshop so the engine is in bits.
It's in brilliant condition but as part of the process I 'm going to   
replace the flywheel oil seal...which involves removing the gland   
nut.....yep, you've guessed it and before anyone says anything, the   
elephant wasn't heavy enough!!.
Searching through the archives I came across references to the 'Kymco   
Torque Meister'
I found them and their tool on the web at:
http://www.kymcovw_dot_com/Pages/tm.html
This looks like just the thing to get the job done, I'm quite happy to   
buy one, BUT where from.
I've mailed em but have had no answer, so I'm asking you folk,   
particularly any Brits if you know of anywhere I can get one in the UK,   
or failing that how can I get one shipped from the good ole US of A and   
how much would it cost???
Meanwhile I'll just go put some new unleaded heads on.
