Jeff sez:

&gt; With the guilt free scenario set up.
&gt; What is your fantasy non-stock, modified bus?

I've got a '66 microbus, camper conversion.

Hmmmm, it would be nice to have

     1.   hydraulic valve lifters.
     1.1  manual choke
     2.   better insulation (both sound and heat)
     3.   bigger gas tank
     3.1  solar panels
     3.1a propane furnace
     3.1b Mr. Fusion  :-)
     4.   Ummmm, cruise control? Naaaaa!
     5.   very robust, extra light, inexpensive to fix, four wheel drive setup
     5.1  with locking diffs, front and back
     5.1a and a winch (while modifying the drive train, might as well add a PTO)

But, really, something like Mr. Vanbondo's/Ellis' RFH '67 Westy would be just
about as good.  (That sucker's gonna be great!)

Gee, the above stuff makes it sound like I want a syncro Westy Vanagon...
Yep, I'd like that, just don't want to pay for it, or fix it.
