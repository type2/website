Subject: Distributor

 I Mostly leave the distributer in to change the point.  I hate to put wear and
tear on the rubber o-ring by putting the distributor in and out,  And it is a
pain to put in the distributor with a new O-ring.  It isn''t hard to put the
points in.  The only hard part is putting the little screw in without dropping
it.  There is a kind of screwdriver which holds onto slotted screws.  The blade
has a middle section which twists to jam itself in the slot.  Handy tool.  I
don't have one but every time I see someone use it, I swear (but forget) to run
right out and get one.
