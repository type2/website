Subject: No brake boost

I just bought a 74 Westy &quot;The Great Pumpkin&quot;,  one of the po's had
removed the egr filter when an aftermarket exhaust was installed. It
seems that they left the brake booster line connected to the egr. Until
I can scrape together the funds to restore the system where is the best
place to re-route the vacuum  for the booster?
