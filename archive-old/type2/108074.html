Subject: Steering knuckle washers

After checking the archives, I was alerted to the fact that there may be
washers between the ball joint nuts and the knuckle.  Are these required?
If not, are they a good idea to incorporate anyway?  Mr. Bentley is mum on
this subject.

Also, how is the upper nut torqued?  Bentley specifies (if memory serves) 70
lb-ft for the lower only.
