Guys, 

Fantasies are all well and good, but...  If you wanna take this up on
Friday, feel free, but save it 'til then, eh?  

Reporting losses and alerts for stolen items are an anytime subject, of
course.  The more people looking and the sooner, the better the chance of
recovery.

These are the very words she uses to describe her life
She said a good day ain't got no rain
She said a bad day's when I lie in the bed
And I think of things that might have been
