Subject: Fuel/Air Mix Adjustment?

Greetings,

Last year I replaced my AFM with a rebuilt unit from Bus Depot.  I've
noticed that my Bosch Platinum plugs foul very quickly.  I've read the
threads in the Archive about these plugs fouling, but was wondering if I
might be running rich.  I didn't have the air/fuel adusted when I put in the
new AFM, should have I?  The engine seems to runs fine: compression at 140
on all 4, timing/dwell set to spec, all vacuum hoses replaced, all engine
seals in place, very little oil usage (1/2 pint per 1K). Maybe I'm just
parinoid, but engine smells hot after a long drive.  The dipstick handle is
just barely hot to the touch.

TIA
