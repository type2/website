Subject: Let's start an oil war

&gt;According to the Brazil / Mexico BTLMEX site, the oil that the
&gt;Volkswagens use in Brazil and Mexico is
&gt;15W-40 weight motor oil.

&gt;So with me switching to 10W-40, is perfectly ok for South Florida
&gt;weather.

I always use Pennzoil HD 30 because I like the pretty yellow bottles, plus
it keeps my idiot light off at hot idle.  This proved too thick for one
frozen NJ winter morning and it blew out my oil cooler seals.  Now I live in
Georgia so that is no longer an issue.  If I still lived up north I might go
with 20W-50 in the winter.  IMHO standard 10W-40 (not the same thing as SAE
40) breaks down under the extreme conditions of an air-cooled engine and
becomes too thin.  Synthetics are probably fine.  Flame suit on!

YMMV.
