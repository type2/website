Subject: Re: [T2] Rainbow Wagon update!

I can vouch for probable loose axle nut.  in one case on a type one some 
idiot for got to torque the nut after lowering the vehicle back  to the 
ground (might have been me). and on another a non vw maint shop did a 
road quick fix for me.  lost that drum just as i was pulling into the 
driveway.  every case i have seen of ripped out splines, i am suspicious 
of the torque on the nut.

&gt; Hey Everyone...
&gt; just thought i'd post back up, on the diagnosis
&gt; that i've finally made on our broke down
&gt; 70westie. after pullin the rear wheel, i've
&gt; found that we have a bad drum. the grooves are
&gt; stripped right off of her. which explains the
&gt; grinding noise that i was hearing, before she
&gt; gave up.
&gt; now was this due to a loose axle nut? or what?
&gt; anyways...thanks again for all the help that the
&gt; list passed our way to figure this out. and i'm
&gt; sure the wagon will be up and runnin soon.
