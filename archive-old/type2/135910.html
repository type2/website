&gt; was trying to install the dizzy
&gt; drive into the engine case and I couldn't get it to
&gt; align up like bently said. I put the engine at tdc. I
&gt; verified this by sticking a screw driver into the #1
&gt; cylinder and making sure that the piston was at its
&gt; most extended point. For the life of me, I couldn't
&gt; get the groove in the distributor drive to line up
&gt; like the picture in bently. I had to go over one
&gt; notch. As long as the vac can is not interfering with
&gt; anything seeing as I now have to rotate the dizzy
&gt; several degrees, is this going to cause a problem? Is
&gt; there somthing that i am not dong right? These things
&gt; are such a PITA to remove once they slip into place.

Hello David   No it shouldnt be a problem  In the future what you should do 
is install the drive gear before mating the case halfs . I have never 
understood why the books show the hard way to do this .  I install the gear and dizzy 
set it on number 1 and then when installing the crank have the number 1 rod at 
the top. check that the timing marks are on top and presto you are on TDC   
later and have fun  mark dearing   Salem Import Service  Salem Va
