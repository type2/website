Subject: Ignition Switch removal

Ignition lock removal.

The Bently/Haynes manuals describe the removal of the ignition switch, but only
for the later models (of bays/loafs) where the key is inserted downwards, 
sortof parrallel to the steering column.

For the earlier type where the key is inserted horizontaly from right to left
into the lock held in a casting between the column and the dash here's what 
to do.... 

DISCONNECT THE BATTERY

Remove steering wheel, wiper switch, and indicator switch from the column.

Undo the screws in the underside of the ignition switch housing; this will allow
the outer column to move up to give you some access (depending on how much 
slack you have in the iginition wires).

If you look straight on at the ignition lock (from the right) imagine a tiny 
hole (1mm dia) in the lock casing inside of the housing at about 10 or 11 
o'clock, quite close to the end where you put the key in. 

Take a paper clip (or stiff wire) and bend into a L shape and fish around with 
the end for the little hole that you cann't quite see or feel because it's on 
a shoulder of the lock casing. Finding the hole with the end of the paper clip 
is the most difficult part. Push the paper clip in against the slight 
resistance of a spring and the lock part of the ignition switch will slide out. 

Phew! :-) :-) :-)

Reference to a replacement lock will show the where the spring is and will help
in locating the hole.
The hole is also shown, but only as a dot, in the appropriate drawing in the
parts manual - which is how I found it.

If you wish to remove the electrical end of the switch the tiny grub screw on 
the bottom of the casing will allow it to slide out.

To remove the central part of the lock (which contains the steering column 
lock) remove both ends, as above, then it's attached to the housing by two 
larger grub screws.

Assembly is the reverse of above (except for poking something in the hole)
