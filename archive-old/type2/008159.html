&gt; &gt; it's been really cold here lately.  I know I've whined a little already
but
&gt; it's true!
&gt; &gt; here's my latest problem, at -14 to 0* F the throttle has been taking 3-5
&gt; seconds to return, makes driving a little exciting sometimes.  I think the
&gt; grease in the cable tube is gelling.  What techniques should I consider to
&gt; clean that out and how much grease or other lubricant should really be in
&gt; there?
&gt; &gt; thanks

&gt;         The only solution is to pull the cables and grease them with silicon
&gt; or teflon grease. If you can get one of those &quot;grease needles&quot; that they use
&gt; to inject grease in a wheel bearing thru the seal, you might be able to pump
&gt; the cable housing with teflon grease or silicon grease.


It is 'Bad Mojo' to let that cable freeze. It caused my engine to blow
up climbing a hill two years ago. Accelerator went down, did not
come back up. I stomped it to break it loose, it just went down
and stayed down. I could not kill the engine in the middle lane 
of traffic, and by the time I got over I had cracked a head,
blown up the fuel line to the carb and started a cheerful little
fire. 

But, Grease is not OK for the accel cable. For the clutch yes,
but when the grease is at zero degrees, the puny little spring
on the carb cant pull the cable back. I just filled my grease gun
with 10W40 (and the remainder of a tube of grease) and 
pumped that in there. It was enough to keep it sliding easily
but not get so hard the cable would not slide. Pump a couple
of strokes of grease in each end to help keep the water
out and the oil in. Not full of oil, but plenty around.

And/or spend a couple of bucks on the rubber seals from the Bus Depot.

And for $2.95, a new cable will also make a big difference.
