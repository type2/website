&gt; From Ron...
&gt;
&gt;  You guys in
&gt; &gt; California/Nevada/Arizona junk busses that would fetch $2k just for body
&gt; &gt; condition alone here on the east coast, and that's no
&gt; &gt; exaggeration.There they end up in junkyards for mechanical reasons, here
&gt; due to rust-through.
&gt;
&gt; [...]
&gt; I am sadly in Australia or I woud have just found a new job for
&gt; myself. Van
&gt; trawling in the hot and dry and selling into the rust belt. And why not?



Actually, it is quite possible.  I saved up enough money to start The Bus
Depot by doing something similar.  The bus situation on the east and west
coasts are quite opposite.  Here, it is not impossible to find a bus in a
junkyard that has a nice, strong engine but is totally rusted out; more
busses end up in junkyards due to axle beam or body rot than due to
mechanical failure.  There, is is nearly impossible to find a good used bus
engine in a junkyard because major mechanical failure (or a collision)
rather than rustthrough is what probably put the bus there.  So it occurred
to me that if I could find good bodies out West and introduce them to good
used motors here on the East, I'd end up with nice rust-free busses that
would be worth their weight in gold here in the rust zone.  I pretty much
stumbled on the idea by accident one night while surfing the net and
drooling over the plethora of cheap rust-free busses in classified ads in
California.

I searched the local California and Nevada newspaper classifieds via the
internet and located nice Westies for a few hundred bucks that had blown
engines, wouldn't pass California smog, etc.  These were busses that the
owners typically were trying to unload for a few hundred bucks before giving
up and calling the junkyard.  I would buy them sight-unseen, and then pay
about $800-$1000 to get them flatbedded here, where I would give them used
motors and/or other repairs.  By the time I was done, I had a $2500-$4000
bus that had cost me maybe $2000-$2500 (plus time and sweat).  I didn't do
this very often or for very long, because Pa. only allows a few auto sales
per year per private individual.  But after a few times I managed to earn a
few thousand bucks, which I used to start The Bus Depot.  (Side note: if
anyone thinks of trying this today, check out auto transport rates first;
I've heard that they're much higher now due to the cost of fuel.)

There was a lot of risk involved because I was sending the bus owner payment
up front, and trusting him both not to steal my money and to honestly
describe the condition of the bus to me over the phone.  I also had a scare
when a transport company that had one of my busses went bankrupt and dropped
off the face of the earth; my bus showed up a month later in the storage lot
of another transport company, where the bankrupt company's driver had dumped
it when he learned that he wasn't going to get paid. Not to mention the risk
that repairs sometimes went way over budget, as you never knew what you'd
run up against until you got the bus running (several of them hadn't been
started in years!).  On the other hand, there was one surprise of the
opposite nature, when a bus sold to me as having a severe rod knock turned
out only to have a bolt rattling around in the muffler!

In every single case, without exception, I found that the sellers I dealt
with were honest and trustworthy.  Not once did anyone try to rip me off or
steal my money.  In the cases where condition was not what I expected, I
believe that it was an honest difference in opinion between what I
considered good condition and what they did.  The experience gave me a real
respect for the overall honesty and enthusiasm of the VW bus community (a
respect which has only been reinforced by my dealings with customers of The
Bus Depot).  I found that I really enjoyed dealing with VW owners, and that
generally they were good people, and of a kindred spirit so to speak.  That
positive experience was what made me decide that I could be very happy
dealing with people like that from then on, and encouraged me to start The
Bus Depot.
