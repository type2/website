Subject: Rust, noise and heat

I have stripped out the interior of my bus and am getting ready to add some
sound deadening material and insulation. The rust, noise and heat website
has some info on it about sound deadening and insulation. Has anybody else
tried these methods? I think the sound deadening material, kool seal, heat
shield and insulation are all good, but has anybody used the foam to fill
cavities? I am a little scared that I might trap moisture in their and
create more rust than I had to start with. What are the opinions of the list
on this issue? What about weight and longevity? Does anybody know how this
bus is doing now? 

Thanks,
Corbett
