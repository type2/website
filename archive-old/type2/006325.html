I knew that post would stir some feelings, but nothing I have not already
fought in the past...The CR battle is one that many people read about, but
less actually attempt. Reading, writing, and doing are 3 different things,
to test something it must be attempted, and not condemned by theory.

Remember, on Paper, Helicopters do not fly, but did that stop Sikorsky from
doing it?

As for &quot;sharing knowledge&quot; John Connolly, Joe Locicero and Myself are the
only &quot;businessmen&quot; who frequently share anything with the public, especially
on forums and lists such as this one. I'm more than willing to share, like
my post stated, but not details of .0010 accuracy concerning what it has
taken me TIME, MONEY and SWEAT to learn and moreover, PROVE. I honestly
share, to better the community and maybe so someone else won't send a
connecting rod to MARS, like someone else did before LEARNING from mistakes.

I would be more than happy to go off list, as someone stated, as rules and
regulations of this list must be adhered to. I respect this list, and it's
contributors, I only trying to shed some light on a very controversial
subject...

&gt; &gt; Would we have a lot of trouble with gas at low altitudes with the higher
&gt; &gt;  CR? I know the magic number used to be 9:1 or was it 9.5:1. But all the
&gt; &gt;  changes in gas over the years, I don't know what a safe CR is anymore.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; Before anybody goes and builds an engine with 8:1 compression they should
&gt; read what Gene Berg has to say about compression ratios.  You can call
&gt; 714-998-7500 to get a catalog and the info is in there.
&gt; I contacted Jake (the guy who originally suggested 8:1 CR's) off line and
&gt; asked a few specific questions about his recommendation.  I didn't expect
him
&gt; to spend lots of time replying and I deleted the post so I can't quote
him.
&gt; However, I did get some impressions that I think are worthwhile to pass on
to
&gt; the list.
&gt; I asked him what kind of engine life to expect with 8:1 compression.
&gt; Specifically I asked if he's gotten 100,000 miles or more on such an
engine.
&gt; He didn't answer that question.
&gt; What he did say was that after much trial and error he has a formula
where,
&gt; by adjusting valve sizes and cam grinds he's able to make 8:1 work.  He
&gt; wasn't willing to share any of that info, however.
&gt; Anyway, I think that there is a whole lot more to this than just raising
the
&gt; compression ratio and driving your bus as usual.  I'd hate to see somebody
do
&gt; this and go out and burn a hole in a piston because of running a CR that
is
&gt; too high.
