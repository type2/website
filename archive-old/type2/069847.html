Hey Uncle Joel, I got a new bus! :P  Well, maybe not NEW, but new 2 me!
Actually it's pushing 26 years old this year. ;)  It was one of those sad
cases where everything was starting to go, rust was setting in around the
front, and the engine needed rebuilding.  Shaky at best.  SO as a last
ditch effort the PO took it to a garage to have the engine redone then fix
the rest.  Well, the engine got rebuilt, a hundred dollar payment was made,
and there the bus sat...for about 2 years...rusting  :((  I asked the shop
owner about it a dozen times, but he would not sell it ...yet.
  So  he thot they might come back any day. (?)  Eventually he got wise and
decided to take the engine out and offered to sell me what was left.  Most
of it was intact, but not enough to make the bus worth restoring(IMHO). Nice
windshield, tranny, steering box, lotsa dashboard stuff, good steering wheel,
a straight rear engine mount bar, and a nice aftermarket sunroof up front.
There is no steering lock, and good thing too since there is also no key...
no registration, no title, no ID plates anywhere, no nothin'!  The mechanic
could probably get the title if he had to.  I just hope it's not stolen !!!
By the time they find it it will be chopped into a thousand pieces!  Ba ha ha!!
Ba ha haahahahaha!!!   mumble.. mumble.  But I digress.  Got it for $250!
  I think it is a '70 'cause I have a '69 and '71 Westy and it does not
seem to be either, but a mix of the two;  it has the old style wheels,
but has running lights on the back corners, old style door handles, etc.
Can one of you 1970 standardbus drivers set me straight?  How can I tell
for sure if it is a '70?

 Uncle Joel, you can add this  one to the stats as a bus which came to the end
of the road at my house.  In this case without making an ash of itself *&lt;:)
I figure it will make great storage for a lot of junk I have in the house :)

Drive on,  Chris  Red    '69 Westy 'Sparky'
                  White  '71 Westy 'Otto'
                  White  '70? Parts bus
                  Orange '74 Beetle 'Pumpkin'
                  Yellow '72 Beetle 'Sunny'
                  White  '72 Super Beetle 'Sugar'
                  Red    '72 Parts SB  Formerly known as Herbie, now
