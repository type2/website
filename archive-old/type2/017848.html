&gt; Another cheaper alternative, is to buy a 6 inch nipple from your
&gt; FLP(lumbing)S, screw it in the block and put the oil pressure sender on
&gt; the top of it.  The thread for the oil pressure sender is tapered 1/8&quot;
&gt; NPT (National Pipe Thread).  The nipple needs to be at least 6 inches
&gt; long such that the sender towers above the engine and does not interfere
&gt; with the distributor.  I did this about two weeks ago and it works
&gt; great.

Michael:
I don't think I'd recommend that as a permanent fix: all the mass of a
tee and a sender hung on a 6&quot; piece of 1/8&quot; pipe. Ultimately all that
shaking is bound to take its toll and either break the pipe or at least
peen out the threads and make the pipe leak. I'd think the best would be
Steve Dolan's approach (but like he mentioned- it needs to be sealed).
Rubber hoses always ultimately fail, and will of course drain all the
oil immediately. (Of course, having said that, I must mention that I
have rubber hoses feeding the filter on my full-flowed 69's engine- but
they have a lot of nylon braid in them).
