Subject: Re: [T2] 76 bus for sale, going twice...

&gt;76 bus sliding sunroof needs work and body work(duh) but not alot of rust,
&gt;minimal. need to sell by end of weekend. if serious inq. contact
&gt;johnnyspintype2_at_aol_dot_com if no takers going to charity, asking $600, will take
&gt;best offer. was driving until clutch cable broke. dont have time to finish
&gt;project ,unfortunately, but would rather it go to one of you than to someone
&gt;that doesn't appreciate it. thanks for your time.

Where is it?

A $600 bus in TN is alot more interesting than a $600 bus in Toronto! &lt;grin&gt;
