&gt; What's the matter with the list? I'm getting bus posts from
&gt; somewhere, but not with the type2 return. And so my mail filter no
&gt; longer works.

With the move to a new server, some of the &quot;forwarding&quot; functionality
that we use for off-list posts seem to have gotten messed up.  I
noticed this after I cleaned up the off-list files and found a bunch
of posts that had escaped my filter too.

Bear with us for a couple of days until Steve gets back.  He's the
chief fixer of problems of this sort.  You wouldn't like the results
if I mucked around with it!  :)
