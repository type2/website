I took a little piece of gas hose with me to the store and just did a look
and fit.  I THINK it was a 3/32&quot; ID, but don't trust that.  You just cut the
flared ends off, file smooth and bend to fit.  I used those coils you slide
over the top and skootch out, but any way works fine that doesn't kink the
pipe.

Here's my contribution to the advancement of gas line installation:  I
bought larger rubber hose with an ID equal to the OD of the hard line.  Then
I cut it into short pieces (2&quot;), split it lengthwise and slipped it over the
pipe where the tabs on the underside of the body hold the gas line.  Buffers
the hard pipe from the metal body.

Then where it passes through the firewall, I did the same thing and clamped
a stainess steel band clamp around the outside rubber hose on either side of
the firewall, so it can't slide off.

I just doglegged the line up and to the left once through the firewall to
clear the engine and ran it straight to the rear.  Then I switched to soft
hose again (the good stuff, cloth on metric rubber) so I could go to a
typical fuel filter, then on to the pump.

I also have a 3&quot; length of soft hose off the bib in the tank to the start of
the hard pipe, with double clamps on both ends. I don't worry about leaking
fuel any more.
