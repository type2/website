&gt; 
&gt; In the absence of detonation, I don't see how this can be.  Low octane
&gt; fuels have the same heat value as high octane fuels.  The only
&gt; difference is that high octane fuels have a lower flame front
&gt; propagation speed, which reduces their tendancy to auto-ignite (knock).
&gt; 
&gt; The FTP reference you cite makes no connection between octane and
&gt; operating temperature.

from the FTP site:

&quot;6.2  Why do we need Octane Ratings?

To obtain the maximum energy from the gasoline, the
compressed fuel-air 
mixture inside the combustion chamber needs to burn evenly,
propagating out 
from the spark plug until all the fuel is consumed. This
would deliver an 
optimum power stroke. In real life, a series of pre-flame
reactions will 
occur in the unburnt &quot;end gases&quot; in the combustion chamber
before the flame 
front arrives. If these reactions form molecules or species
that can 
autoignite before the flame front arrives, knock will occur
[21,22].
 
Simply put, the octane rating of the fuel reflects the
ability of the 
unburnt end gases to resist spontaneous autoignition under
the engine test
conditions used. If autoignition occurs, it results in an
extremely rapid 
pressure rise, as both the desired spark-initiated flame
front, and the 
undesired autoignited end gas flames are expanding. The
combined pressure 
peak arrives slightly ahead of the normal operating pressure
peak, leading 
to a loss of power and eventual overheating. The end gas
pressure waves are 
superimposed on the main pressure wave, leading to a
sawtooth pattern of 
pressure oscillations that create the &quot;knocking&quot; sound.

The combination of intense pressure waves and overheating
can induce piston 
failure in a few minutes. Knock and preignition are both
favoured by high 
temperatures, so one may lead to the other. Under high-speed
conditions 
knock can lead to preignition, which then accelerates engine
destruction. &quot;

In the 7th line of the second paragraph overheating is
clearly addressed.

&gt; That wasn't quite what I posted.  What I said was that ping was the
&gt; only reason to go to a higher octane fuel.

Not all knock can be heard by the human ear. What I said was
that if an otherwise sound engine is &lt;&lt;OVERHEATING&gt;&gt; and
your running 87, try some 91. I NEVER said that a properly
running engine would run cooler.

Again from the FTP:

&quot;6.13 Can higher octane fuels give me more power?

On modern engines with sophisticated engine management
systems, the engine
can operate efficiently on fuels of a wider range of octane
rating, but there 
remains an optimum octane for the engine under specific
driving conditions. 
Older cars without such systems are more restricted in their
choice of fuel, 
as the engine can not automatically adjust to accommodate
lower octane fuel.
Because knock is so destructive, owners of older cars must
use fuel that will 
not knock under the most demanding conditions they
encounter, and must 
continue to use that fuel, even if they only occasionally
require the octane.&quot;

Not to sound like a broken record but, Its your ride,
believe what you want.
