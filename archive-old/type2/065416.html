If you ground out your positive terminal while the machine is running it will 
stop and all your acc. will not work.  It is not something that you want to do. 
My brother and I were tooling down highway 10 one day when we lost power and all
the stuff went off.  We pulled our '65 Belair over and popped the hood and there
before me was one very hot, glowing, formerly red, battery cable.  I reached in 
and grabbed it with a very thick leather glove and that stuff melted right 
through that leather.  Stung a mite.  Kids, don't do this at home.
