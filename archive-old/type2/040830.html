All,

You can get replacement straps (rubber) for the inside
of your '68-'73 Westy (dunno about other years,
probably the same, though) at most VWFLAPS. They're
sold as baja-bug hood ties, and made my EMPI/BugPack.

These are the only products I've found by either of
those companies worth purchasing, and they work great.
Mine were original when I bought my bus, and badly
cracked...I compare the EMPI's, and they were
*exactly* the same, except they were black, not gray.

Took about 5 minutes to instal, and only cost $9.00
(so cheap that I bought a second set for
emergencies;-).

Yes, the top still shudders when a semi passes going
the other direction at highway speeds, but I no longer
worry about the top flying off.


Also, if your stock hardware (that the strap hooks to)
is bent, cracked, etc, have it welded or replace it.
One of mine had a crack in it, and I had it welded for
$5.00.
