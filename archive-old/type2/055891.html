&gt;Problem:  Suddenly, will Intermittently die after warm-up. Will restart and
&gt;idle, then die shortly after.  Pumping the gas pedal really fast seems to
&gt;suspend the dieing.  No backfire or popping when it dies.  It is not a real
&gt;abupt die either.  Let it sit about ten minutes and the problem disappears
&gt;for 3-5 minutes.  Engine temp: 180-200.
&gt;Recent changes:  I added VDO oil temp guage and sending unit (oil drain
&gt;bolt).

Josh,

It sounds like you are looking fuel due to vapor lock. If its not too much
trouble hook up a ignition switch and starter switch at the back of the
bus or have some one with you to be a remote starter switch. Install
a simi-perminate fuel pressure gague between the carb and the last
fuel filter.

You can also use a cheap AM/FM radio as a spark monitor. Your coil
could be breaking down under heat but I don't think so. If pumping the
foot feed helps it's almost a fuel problem for sure.
