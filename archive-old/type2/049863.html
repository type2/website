Subject: [T2] Re:automatic transmission options (fuel return)

If you need the function of the fuel tank sump in the later fuel injected bus 
fuel tanks but don't want to switch to a later tank, Miller Fuel Injection 
offers a separate aluminum (I think) sump tank that he sells as an option for 
his CIS fuel injection conversion kits. He may sell them separately.

You also may be able to use the small plastic sump tank that the VW Fox has 
mounted with the fuel pump and filter under the car.
