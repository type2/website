&gt;first of all, i didn't feel like going and getting another wheel bearing.  so
&gt;i started messing with the wires.   the wiper motor turned on when i pulled
&gt;the knob, but it made a horrible noise and anyway both pivot are broken, so i
&gt;pulled it.  either i can get a 67 unit to put it, though i am told it won't
&gt;fit well because of frame differences (?)  or use the new pivots found in an
&gt;old vw shop.

Ellis:
True, the '67 wiper assy will not fit with out mods in (some) earlier buses
due to differences in the &quot;defroster&quot; duct work under the dash. Very minor
die grinder mods are necessary for the desired fit. I have a '67 2spd assy
in the '57 single cab and it works as well as it would in a '67 and far
better than the OEM rod and z shaft set up . The die grinding is very minor.
Look at where the motor canister doesn't fit and die grind the seam flange
where it's in the way.
Three things to consider:
1. Y'all know how much of a vintage Nazi that I tend to be.
2. It's under the dash and no one is gunna see it or care.
3. Screw it. It's your bus. Be safe especially if it rains near you more
often than the typical once every decade as in Arizona.
Just my opinion...
