Subject: re: slider roof options

--As with everything it isnt done yet. there will be
a locking latch on the inside (when it quits raining
I'll work on it)----
&quot;&quot;The only criticism I have is that you should have
done the latching inside.&quot;&quot;

---The slider roof has a lip that fits inside the
hole in the roof. When closed there isnt much wiggle
room. Also the compression latches were used to help
keep the seal compressed. They dont have enough
tension
on them to stress the hinges. Note that the latch
catch
hardware is at an angle so that the latch pulls down
not so much sideways. In addition, all of the
mechanical fasteners go through not only the roof
metal but through the sunroof stiffening frame.------
&quot;&quot;The way you have those latches mounted pulls the top
sideways against the hinge bolts that go through the
thin body (roof) metal on the other side.&quot;&quot;

---I have them tight enough to compress the seal which
keeps it from rattling and keeps the weather out
(hopefully) :-) I dont see this happening.--------
&quot;&quot;&quot;If you have them tight enough to keep the roof from
rattling then the vibration of driving around is
slowly going to tear that metal over the next 10 years
or so.&quot;&quot;
