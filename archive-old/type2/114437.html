Subject: Junk / Parts

I'm clearing out my shed and I have a few parts I don't know what to do 
with.  I have a 72 bus transmission I bought a few years back as a 
&quot;rebuilt&quot; from some cut rate dealer advertised in Hot VW's.  It leaked 
oil from the beginning and finally wouldn't stay in first gear after 
about a year.  Before I haul it off the the scrap heap I thought I'd 
make sure this is not some super rare part that somebody could have 
used.  Does anybody want this, free?

I also have a two sets of heads.  One set came of a 72 and the other 
came off a 73.  I think that both sets are original German heads, but 
they all have some slight cracking around the exhaust valves and a 
dropped seat or two.  Should I save one set to rebuild as my ultimate 
dream engine some day, should I send them to the scrap heap, or does 
anybody want them.  I know this is a loaded question, but I'm going to 
give away one set for sure.

I also have three old starters that I have run for various amounts of 
time.  Each one had the mysterious &quot;hot start&quot; problem.  Pretty sure 
these are junk, but I thought I'd see if anybody wanted them (for free) 
before I haul them off.

Nothing beats the brand new Bosch starter I bought last year.  After 8 
years of starting problems I've not had a single starting problem since.
