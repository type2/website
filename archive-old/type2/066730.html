Subject: heat cont.

But what about preheating for all the non-westies?  I don't have any 
electricity anywhere near my bus (college parking lot, no coverage or 
anything) although I'm thinking about renting a garage down the street 
for the winter months.  How are we supposed to preheat?  I'm really 
getting excited about being able to feel my extremities during the 
winter driving season!
