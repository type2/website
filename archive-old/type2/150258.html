When you talk about gaskets are you talking about the Valve cover gaskets?

Max

If you really want the number I can send it to you.

Max,

Give me the &quot;Jerks&quot; phone number----

If they will do all that I mentioned, plus included the gasket set for
$120.00 I'm going to send all my head work there !!
