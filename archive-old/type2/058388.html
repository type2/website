&gt; On the flywheel side, it's possible that the pilot bearing is seized

&gt; able to work the flywheel off.  Another approach is to have someone
&gt; depress the clutch pedal while you twist the flywheel back and forth. 
&gt; This puts spring pressure on the flywheel pushing it off of the
&gt; transmission.  Be warned that the flywheel might come at you with
&gt; considerable force if it breaks loose!  Be prepared!  Start with a
&gt; little pressure on the clutch pedal, not the pedal to the floor.

Thinking of it some more, it seems as if the flywheel should come off
of the gland nut (or its remains) even if the pilot bearing is seized.
 I'll bet that it's just jammed into the bell housing, since it had to
move further forward than normal when the gland nut loosened or failed.

Same cure, though, just make sure that the flywheel comes out straight
so as to prevent damage to the pilot shaft.
