Subject: Very Original 1971 WEsty Worth?

Hi All,

Over the weekend I got a call from an Old &quot;Cherman Man, 
about a Westy he has had since 1972.

Here is the poop...

*80,000 original miles
*original paint, mechanicals all in excellent condition 
(from a cursory glance no hint of rusting!)
*complete original unhacked interior
*all bills, recepeits etc. for last 20+ years
*only driven in the summer
*meticulous maintenance
*has owned the bus since 1972 (bought from original owner)

Now I know that if this bus was/is is California it would 
prolly be worth like $700 'cos all busses there are in great 
shape ;). But up here busses in this kind of condition are 
RARE! So I am thinking it might be worth a tad more than 
$700;).

So the bottom line is that the guy told me he is willing to 
take offers on the bus. I would like to hear people's 
thoughts on what they think this bus is worth. I realize 
that value of a bus is somewhat attributable to scarcity, 
and rust free busses are mighty scarce up here!
