Subject: Re: [T2] Engine Cleaning

Brian Verbeek sends:

&gt; As far as I know that is just common practice, and some machine
&gt; shops even state on their invoice that it is your responsibillity
&gt; to make sure all the shavings are cleaned out before assembly.

The machinist I deal with sells a part you can take home and put into the
engine. It doesn't have metal shavings, it doesn't have crud and it's in a
garbage bag when you pick it up.
