&gt; I have noticed that my temps seem to be rising as the temp outside gets colder

That's what sucks about the VDO CHT gauge and sender: you have to lick your
thumb, stick it out the window and second guess the readings.

&gt; Is this normal for these VDO gauges - are they affected by outside changes in
&gt; temp ? Wondering before I start looking around the engine compartment -

Thermocouples are often calibrated at 70F. When the other end (the cold
junction) is at a lower temp the voltage increases and the causes the gauge
to read high. When it's hot out the reading dups you into thinking the
engine is running colder when it's actually much hotter.

The VDO gauge is too cheap to add the temperature compensating circuitry.
The thermocouple is also not linear and they don't take that into account
either.

It wouldn't add much to the cost to improve them but these gauge were
designed 20-30 years ago so they probably have no interest in redesigning
them.
