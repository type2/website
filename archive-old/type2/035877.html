&gt; Buried at the bottom of a posting last week was the
&gt; story of a driver
&gt; concerning having his poptop blow open from the wind
&gt; over the Columbia

&gt; mph!!
&gt; 

Yep, that was me!

&gt; Been there, done that.  I just drove that bridge
&gt; four times and it was
&gt; really hairy the third pass, last Jan 29th.  I was
&gt; going 60 mph and had
&gt; 45 mph side winds there.

*60*????? I don't know.....perhaps you mean the
Interstate Bridge (on I-5); the Hawthorne's speed
limit is 35mph and too short/dangerous to go too much
faster.


&gt; I drove my 71 westy poptop,
&gt; with the front roof
&gt; corners nicely clamped down using modified hood
&gt; clamps with solid metal
&gt; threaded shafts instead of rubber straps.

&lt;SNIP&gt;

A simpler and cheaper method for a lot of folks would
be to use the EMPI (GAWD, I *HATE* recommending their
products....but these *do* work; unlike the rest of
their junk) baja hood-straps. They come with all the
hardware needed, except for some sheet metal screws
and only cost $9.00 or so for a set of two. This is
exactly the same setup as under the poptop from the
factory, but it would have to mount upside-down to fit
properly.

Just a thought.
