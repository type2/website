Hello,
Well I'am having a heck of a time trying to fix my
brakes. I had a spongy pedal after bleeding them
and tried bleeding again and then adjusting them but
that didnt solve the problem. When I put the parking
brake on the pedal would become a bit harder but
it was still spongy. I adjusted the brakes again
but got no where. So I checked the rear wheel
cylinders and found a leak on them. I just replaced
both of them with a brand new pair.
After that I bleeded them, adjusted the rears, and bleeded again.
I still have a spongy pedal though, and the handbrake
has little too no effect.
There is no leaks on the wheels or on the master cylinder.

I bleed the brakes untill the bubbles stopped and kept
bleeding with fluid passing through.
What I have replaced is, brake hoses, and rear wheel cylinders.

I dont know what else to do, can anyone help me out with
this problem? I dont know what else to do ;(
I've read more then I can handle on brakes, now I need help.

thanks for any advice
