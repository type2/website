Subject: Wiring Disaster

Hello All,
I attempted to post this last night to no avail.  Please accept my humble
apologies if the other post finally arrives.
If you recall from last week, I posted that I wanted to get my horn working.
I stated that I didn't think it was a good thing that I was tugging on
wires, so I decided to stop.  Paul from Huntington NY was kind enough to
respond and try to help.  Well as my luck with HapyBus goes, I have been
planning a rafting trip down the Upper Gauley, ole' HapyBus decides to test
my patience.  Yesterday, we had a meltdown of wires.  Something touch
something else, and poof, he dies.  Then a billow pf smoke decides to
spread.  I really hoped it would catch fire, since it insured for stated
value, it seems the only way to get my money out of him.
Anyway (I am venting) I am gonna do this wiring thing myself.  All other
repairs have been hired out, and darn it, I want to be a bus owner, not just
a financier.  So, is this wiring thing as easy as splicing bad wires?  When
I go to FLAPS, is there anything special I need? Like specific wire?  How
about removing the dash?  Would you recommend this?  It seems like my
accessibility would be greatly enhanced.
I would appreciate all and any thoughts.
TIA
FEBIII
