In your bus configuration, I think the best location would be inside the
jumpseat behind the driver.  You could put a cover over it so you could
still store stuff, but you could take air from where your feet would be if
you were sitting on that seat and duct it both front and back out the side
of the seat into the walk through area.  I wouldn't put it under the bus, a
heater is too nice of a tool not to keep it inside.

Then buy a relay and put a thermostat on it!!  Nice and toasty all night at
what ever temp you set it at.


&gt;Hi Everybody,
&gt;   I've spent all winter getting a BN2 gas heater ,that I bought, fixed up
&gt;and running right.  Now I'm starting to think about installation into our
&gt;&quot;71 westy.  Of course my first idea was to put it in the left side of the
&gt;engine bay, but I'd like to reserve that space for a second battery.  Now
&gt;I'm thinking of putting it under the bus in some sort of protective metal
&gt;box.  I'd then take intake air from inside our westy and duct the heat into
&gt;the normal heater tube. This would provide recirculation of the warm air
&gt;from in the bus.  Of course exhaust from the heater would go overboard.
&gt;   I'd like to hear your opinions of my under bus scheme, and of any other
&gt;locations and ideas that you think would be good.  Thanks for the input!
