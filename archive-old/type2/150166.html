Subject: Re: [T2] Living out of a Bus on the road with Kids

Hi Tony,

That same topic also came up on &quot;Seventh Heaven&quot; a few years back.  
(My wife and daughters are addicted to that show). The protagonists  
in the story were trying to help this family who were forced to live  
in their bus because they had been evicted from their house.

&quot;Forced to live in a bus??? I said to my family.... &quot; That's how we  
spend our vacation!!&quot;

Happy trails,

&gt;    That's fine for scholastic proficiency, but schools/neighborhoods
&gt; teach socialization (or should). There was an episode of &quot;Boston
&gt; Public&quot; a few years ago and the gist was that one of the students
&gt; was livng with her mother in a (Gasp!) VW Bus...I wonder how a
&gt; kid would react to other kids asking him/her &quot;Where do you live?&quot;
