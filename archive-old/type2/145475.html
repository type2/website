&gt;  I also have a post running around about a bad hesitation after partial
&gt; rebuild... I tried an SVDA distributor and got the plug wires wrong and BOOM!! The mother of backfires.....

 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

&gt; Since you have a 78 bus and that muffler is from a type 4 engine without a catalytic converter.....  do you
&gt; still have fuel injection on it?

&gt; If yes, did you put hose clamps on all the hoses that connect TO the big S hose and TO the decel valve?
&gt;
&gt; If no, then they probably all blew off like they should when you have a backfire.

&gt; If yes, then you probably destroyed your AFM. The backfire comes back thru the air vane and bends it. Someone
&gt; a while had a picture of his AFM where the force of the backfire blew the AFM apart, broke the rivet holding
&gt; it together!

&gt; Yes, a spark at wrong time will cause this. If a exhaust valve is open it blows out the exhaust, if an intake
&gt; valve is open it blows thru the carb/FI.
&gt; This is why you never put hose clamps on the air/vacuum hoses except on the ends of the big S hose.

I'm trying to figure out how an exploded muffler could destroy the AFM.
The only way I can think of is if the pressure fed back through the EGR
pipe and valve (does this year have one?) or if the spark occurred exactly
on the valve overlap.  It must have been a heck of a long cranking to get
the entire muffler stoichometric, or perhaps some ether was involved.
