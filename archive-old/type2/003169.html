You guys are rite bondo and filler are good if used rite, BUT 9 out of 10
people that use it have no idea of the way to use it. I have some pics in
file from the last 4 years of restoring VW's alone that will show you what
i'm talking about , I have a 57 and 55 both here now that were major bondo
wagons and each had fiberglass in them to, in addition to newspaper, spray
foam,wire mesh,(various sizes), window screen wire,steelwool pads, this
among other stuff i have forgotten about. On the 57 the front nose and BOTH
rear corners were sculpted from bondo, as well as the drip rail and all the
skylights on the drivers side. These owners will tell you bad bondo work
will cost you in the long run. I'll be posting some pics first of July on my
pages of Kents 56, in these it will show the use of metal to metal filler
and another type of filler used to do the smoothing of the 56. i'll post a
notice when i update, later and as always this is the way i feel about bondo
, but most of my experinces with other peoples work is bad. Sorry if this
offends anyone.
