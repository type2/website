Subject: 71 camper for sale in Seattle

Greetings..

I've finally decided to put my 71 camper up for sale.  My wife and I are
moving to Albuquerque and decided that we want to go fast and light, hence
the yard sale last weekend.. Anyway..

Here are the details:

71 w/1600 DP
Compression good all around
Eberspacher BN4 in excellent shape (needs spark plug replacement)
Rare interior layout in very good shape.  The bus was brought over from
Germany by a serviceman and the layout is quite unique.  I'm sure they're
around, but I have yet to see a Westphalia or campmobile with this layout.

Full width bed, electric refrigerator, sink, and poptop original fabric but
in good shape, all flooring, paneling solid and intact.

The bus is beige, w/forest green hubs and is straight with no major dents or
deformities.  The rear corners need a bit of work and the driver's floorpan
needs to be replaced at some point.

This bus is very well loved and I had all the intentions of doing the body
work myself (parts as well), but ran out of time.

Asking $2500 for &quot;Putty&quot;

Bus is in the U-District at 3106 NE 55th St. (when I'm not driving it),
which is just NE of University Village shopping center, across from the
cemetery.

Please email or phone me if interested.

Cheers,

Tom Howze
