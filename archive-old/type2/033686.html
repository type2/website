Dear List Members,

The hubcap/baton has made it to Greenville, S.C. and is now resting
comfortably with Joy McMahan. The meeting was at the Books-a-Million
bookstore (a very tempting distraction!) and Joy and her bus, Alex
arrived decked out in Christmas and VW regalia. We had a wonderful time
looking at each other's busses and comparing notes. (Alex's interior is
very handsome and practical with a cedar tongue and groove floor and
birch and cedar cabinets). 

After depositing a glow-in-the-dark daisy and a super cool bus sticker
donated by Joy in the  Souvenir Box, Joy and Alex, and Gus, Eddy and I
repaired to the India Palace Restaurant for a feast fit for a Raja! Our
waiter was an entertaining and very capable young man named Parbesh
Kumar. 

We stuffed ourselves and talked computers and busses and were very
reluctant to say our goodbyes, but Joy took possession of the Sacred
Hubcap and Souvenir Box after appropriate incantations and salaams and
we promised to meet at future campouts of the Full Moon Bus Club of
which Joy and I are proud members.

There are photos of the event posted at:

Gus, Eddy and I have had a happy and enlightening time participating in
the Great Bus Tour and hope that many of you who are interested will
sign up to carry the Hubcap too!
You never know who you'll meet along the way and what future friends and
VW cohorts are waiting to present themselves.

Tired, but happily yours,

Chris and Gus in Atlanta
