Subject: RE: more on pedestal mats...

&gt; Thanks for the responses to my pedestal mat problems.  For those of you
&gt; who inquired,  the pedestal mats I ordered are rubber and they  wrap
&gt; around the side to the back.  I had one guy respond that he has a 72 and
&gt; he purchased mats from Wolfsburg West and they fit fine so I am thinking
&gt; maybe the mats I have are not made for a 76.  I also had received email
&gt; from a guy with a 73 who had a good fit.  It seems that the seat
&gt; pedestal in the early 70's bus is not as high as the later years.  So if
&gt; there is anyone who has a late 70's bus who has purchased pedestal mats
&gt; that are a good fit please let me know.


The mats all come from the same manufacturer, whether you get them from me,
Wolfsburg West, or West Coast Metric.  They are designed to fit '68 thru mid
'76, at which time VW made minor changes to the seat stands.  Unfortunately,
there are no current plans to repro the late versions, because of the
comparatively small range of years that require them.  However, it is
possible to piece together a bit of your old mat with the new ones and get
an acceptable, if admittedly not perfect, fit for a late '76 up. (Certainly
an improvement over the torn up ones that are on most busses now, anyway.)
Given for years nothing was available at all, I was happy to find anything
at this point.

Actually, you need two sets of mats that do the entire job.  One set does
the sections directly underneath each seat (toward the outsides), and
another set does the sections toward the insides of the seat stands and also
the vertical section between the two seats (facing eachother in the
&quot;walkthru&quot; area).  Each set is sold as a pair (does two seats), so if you
buy one of each pair you have enough to do two entire seat stands.  Both are
on my website and in stock. As always, list members get an additional 5%
discount if you ask for it when ordering.
