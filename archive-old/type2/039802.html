Subject: RE: Coil questions...

&gt; The Bosch blue coils are apparently NLA and have
&gt; been replaced by the Mexi-Brazillian ones. I'm not too
&gt; fond of the other Mexi-Brazillian parts I've tried
&gt; (muy caca quality, so to speak). Any other suggestions


I have a closeout on original German Bosch &quot;black&quot; coils (the stock ones for
busses, etc.)  for about $20.  On the website &quot;bargains&quot; page and also in
the new catalog.
