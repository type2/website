Subject: Re: *What* ring gap? Which spacing?

iI orient all three oil ring gaps 120 degrees apart - paint dot one goes
up. Other two 120 from that. I _never_ put _any_ sealant of _any_kind on
anything but the case halves, with very few and very rare ecxception.
Surely NOT on cylinder bases. The paper works fine. Out of dozens and
dozens I've only ever had one that leaked at a cylinder base and it didn't
leak enough to be noticed except when I tore it down years later.

&gt; Hi all:
&gt; 
&gt; Got my crankcase reassembled without pinching any bearings.  
&gt; Crank turns freely, rods slip nicely.  New pistons installed - some 
&gt; more freely than others - and am ready to slip on the cylinders.
&gt; 
&gt; The references say oil ring gap up.  My oil ring has no gap.  
&gt; Actually, it's a three-piece affair that came on the Cofap pistons, 
&gt; made of one central waffly piece and two skinny rings.  The waffly 
&gt; piece has red/green paint on it where it butts together - no gap.  
&gt; The skinny rings (I'm not talking about the other two &quot;real&quot; rings, 
&gt; now) do have gaps.  Center the skinny ring gaps and the paint 
&gt; marks at the top?  New ring style, never mind?
&gt; 
&gt; Next question: the other two rings should have their gaps spaced 
&gt; 120 degrees away, i.e., if all rings have gaps, the gaps are 
&gt; equidistant about the piston circumference?  I ask because 
&gt; Haynes seems to suggest that the gaps are to be equidistant 
&gt; within the top 180 degrees, i.e., equidistant but all in the same 
&gt; &quot;hemisphere&quot;.
&gt; 
&gt; How many folks put sealant around the base of the cylinders 
&gt; (where the paper gasket is), as suggested by the engine rebuild 
&gt; video?
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks!
