Subject: RE: [T2] lpg conversion?

&gt;i would like to get some info on converting my 77 bus to run off propane.  i
&gt;have seen a few sites on the internet, but there seems to be little usefull
&gt;information.  if any of you could direct me to some information it would be
&gt;greatly appreciated.
&gt;thank you

In my edition of Muir, there is a chapter (?) at the back on conversions and 
gives the address of someplace in TX to write to for more info.  I am not at 
home this weekend, but if no one else posts the info, I can provide it when I 
return on Sunday night.  If it helps I purchased my copy 2 years ago, so I 
don't know what edition that makes it, but it is a start.
