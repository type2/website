Dana,

I don't think there's a set RPM that would define lugging. Stock VW motors
put out maximum torque between 1800 and 3200 RPM.

When the motor feels like it's laboring, it's probably lugging. I've cruised
at 2000 RPM in 4th on a level road, no problem, and accelerated from there
(not the pedal to the metal type of acceleration), also no problem.

As far as redline, some say you can cruise at top speed, some say not. I
wouldn't, but shifting at 4500 occasionally should pose no threat to your
motor. Remember, it was *still* an old design when the HP/RPM figures were
calculated.

&gt; Am I overly concerned?

Yup.
