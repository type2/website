Erich,

If you do not have to meet smog requirements, A 009 at 10 degrees should work.
I'd prefer a single diaphram vac advance for the street at 3.5 degrees.  Sound
like your Distributor drive shaft may be off a tooth or two.  Or, as you say, a
bum pulley mark.

Stranger things have happened.

&gt; it will only work at 16 degrees before???
