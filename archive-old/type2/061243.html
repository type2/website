Subject: Custom Bumpers and Spoilers
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

One item that I think may have gotten lost in the shuffle when I announced
the European parts I brought in were the bumpers and spoilers. I have full
dress-up kits for Vanagons (all years), plus Vanagon front spoilers and
'68-72 rear bumpers.

The complete bumper/skirt kits look very similar to the plastic bumper cover
and skirt kits that are stock on '87-up Wolfsburg Editions and '89-up GL's.
People have called me before asking where they could get the late model
style bumpers, but until now they were over $2000 a set so it wasn't
economically feasible.  Now you can upgrade to this look for more like $500,
which is hardly more than the cost of a pair of regular metal bumpers.  You
can see this kit at http://www.busdepot_dot_com/spoiler.htm .

The bumpers themselves are very similar to the original VW ones.  Not
identical, but very similar.  They are plastic like the factory ones, and
like the factory ones they are really more &quot;bumper cover&quot; than &quot;bumper&quot; in
that they are not designed to withstand a collision without cosmetic damage.
Then again, neither do the stock bumpers, so you're not really downgrading
there. The skirts that go on the front doors are also similar, although
mounting hardware is not included so you'll have to make your own.  The
skirts that go along each side of the van, below the rocker panels, are a
bit more rudimentary than the molded plastic ones that VW used, however.
They are only a few inches tall, made of metal, and simply screw into the
bottom of the rocker panel, extending below it rather than partially
covering it like the Wolfsburg one does.  Everything is in black and is also
paintable.  This whole package is $499.95 plus shipping.  It is custom made
for the Vanagon and no one else has them.  It's a really nice package for
the price.

Also, I brought in six sets of OEM Volkswagen front spoilers for $139 a set.
These are the same spoilers that come with the late model Vanagons, and
mount underneath the front bumper.  You can add them to ANY VANAGON, even
one with the stock chrome bumpers, to dress it up.  It also looks great with
the above bumper kit.  They are also on the van pictured at
http://www.busdepot_dot_com/spoiler.htm .

Lastly, I got three 1968-71 rear bumpers.  These have been unavailable for
many, many years.  These bumpers are the same as the original, except that
they have brackets attached to the inside of them which do not fit US
busses.  In the US these bumpers just bolt on with holes right through the
bumper.  So you would have to get rid of the brackets and drill holes
through the bumper for the mounting bolts.  Still, this is a minor mod to
make considering that until now, restoring a used bumper was your only
option.
