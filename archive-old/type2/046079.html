Morning List!

Leaving for Washington tonight for a week to visit my folks.  They live in
Aberdeen.  (Never been there, don't know where it is - takes the same time
to drive to their house from either Portland or Seattle is all I know.  Any
listees in the area?  I have no idea what my mother has planned for my wife,
daughter, and myself, when we get there, except she mentioned a rain forest
she wants us to see.

Having to leave Gretchen the '62 home as I don't have the time to drive it
all and get back, so I'll be taking the plane :(  Maybe I'll get two weeks
off in a row next time.  Ha!

Adam
