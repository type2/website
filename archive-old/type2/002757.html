Jim,

Any parts store should have a spray adhesive for this purpose.  Some
manufactureres call it a vinyl adhesive, others call it an upholstery
adhesive.  I ended up getting 3M brand at a Pep Boys because I trust their
name.

Just ask someone working in the store where you can find the spray adhesives
and then make your selection.

By the way, if your pedastal pads are in bad shape, Wolfsburg West,
www.woflsburgwest_dot_com,  sells replacement pads that fit great for about
$30.00 for both sides.

Good luck,
Phil

&gt;
&gt;Dear list:
&gt;
&gt;I need to reattach the peeling rubber that has detached from the seat
&gt;platforms.  This is the vertical area on the inboard side of the seats, in
&gt;the walkthrough area.  What is the right kind of adhesive to use here?
&gt;
&gt;Thanks,
&gt;
&gt;Jim Ryan
