Subject: Re: AType2 /History Question

&gt; &gt;Okay all you keepers of arcane Type2 knowledge. Here's one for 'ya: 
&gt; Why is
&gt;it that the engineers of our little beasties saw fit to install a 
&gt;completly
&gt;functional ashtry, and a 12v. acc. socket, yet no FREAKING cig. lighter.
=================================&gt;
I might have some insight into this, as my wife comes from Bradford, 
Pennsylvania.
Yes, that's right; the home of Zippo Lighters.

You see, there was an understanding, way back when, that Zippo would 
not sell busses, and VW would not sell lighters.

Even today, you will not find a VW salesroom in Bradford, Pa.

It's Friday
