Can't make it myself this year, but definitely a show worth going to.
 Put on by the nice people at Vintage Volkswagen Club of America, Silver
Circle Chapter.  The people are great, it's not about trailer queens,
and the weather is great.  Make sure to keep an eye out for my friends'
white-on-white '68 Westy with the tent and toy display!
