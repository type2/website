I've posted to this list before of my experience with PLFVW - amazing
quality, poor customer service.  I finally got around to putting the new
poptop on my bus a month or so ago, and am really pleased with it.  It's
just that it took a couple of months longer to get it than promised...

I looked at PLFVW's web site a while ago and it said Dawn was not taking
orders for a month, so that she could catch up on her backlog.  I don't know
if that month is over yet - I haven't checked the site.

I will happily order from her again, as long as there's no time crunch.  I
know I keep repeating, but I think her quality is that good.
