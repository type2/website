Subject: It's Hopeless...

Hey Everyone,

I am in dis-belief... I have spent the last three and a half weeks covered in
grease spending every available minute on my bus.
I spent numerous hours trying to figure out why I wasn't getting fire to the
plugs, why my dizzy was 180 degrees out, only to solve all of those problems
and then find out my oil spurts oil all over the engine and the tranny is
shot.
So I pull the engine, spend a week replacing the tranny and fix the oil cooler
which I have just re-installed.
I bought every available part for the ignition system brand new and carefully
installed all the new componets...This was before I learned about the tranny
problems and oil cooler leaks. So today I hook everything back up and go to
start the engine.  Smoke starts coming from the engine compartment.  I quickly
run back there to learn I plugged the ignition side of the coil to the dizzy
side! f*ck!!!  The green wire going to the dizzy is now completely fried :-(

I feel like letting the project go at this point. I've had at least 15 VW's in
the last ten years and never a project like this one.  This has been the worst
eight months of my life with constant frustrations and money pissed away.
Does anyone know what type of damage this may have done to the ignition
system?  And which parts I will need to replace now?

Thanks for your support, if I happen to jump off my roof head first, I'll have
your replies fowarded to the new owner.

Thanks,

Tom
