Subject: RE: [T2]  New Microbus ( S A V W )

&gt; And adding a water jacket to a Beetle engine
&gt;
&gt; That was not a Beetle engine but a jointly developed Engine by Porsche and
&gt; VW called the Type 4 Engine, When the water jacket was put on it
&gt; became the WASSERBOXER.

Actually the wasserboxer has less in common with the type 4 engine than with
the original Beetle (type 1) engine, with which which it shares a multitude
of parts.  Not that the wasserboxer is exactly the same as either, but it
has more in common with the type 1 engine  than the type 4 engine.
