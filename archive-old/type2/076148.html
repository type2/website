Subject: Re: [T2] coefficient of drag


In a message dated 2/2/02 8:44:10 AM, jon.hathaway_at_verizon_dot_net writes:

&lt;&lt; &quot;After thousands of hours of testing, changing and testing again,
Vanagon's drag coefficient was reduced to a mere 0.44.  This figure
compares favorably with many sedans, and is below that of conventional
vans.&quot;

This is accompanied by a picture of the flow characteristics in wind
tunnel testing.

            Is this what you're looking for..? &gt;&gt;

Yes, but that mere 0.44...(Land Rover is 0.45.) I don't know how &quot;mere&quot;
that is unless the Bays were something closer to a Freightliner...
Thanks.
