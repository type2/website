Subject: Re: [T2] Cutting out at high RPMs: '77 Bus

Good &quot;point&quot;, pun intended. In the Vanagon world, the Temp II sensor would
be suspect, but, I agree, ignition is where it's at.

Points are easy, and that's where I'll start. Plugs, too. Who know last
time they were replaced.

J

&gt; I would spend 95% of your time on the ignition system.
&gt;
&gt; Sounds like the points are bad or the spark plugs are breaking down.
&gt;
&gt; Are the plugs NGK or resister plugs or platinum plugs?
&gt; I like Bosch Super W8CC.......
