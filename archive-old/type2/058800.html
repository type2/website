Hi Listees

Well, I dunno how many listees went to Vanfest, but here's my unbiased report!

Bob writes from an organiser's viewpoint; my comments are purely as an
enthusiastic member of the gaggle of thousands of vans and happy campers
that attend this yearly spectacle. This is now my third year (do I graduate
next year?)

Friday afternoon spent screwing van together. Uneventful trip down, in fact 
van is running suspiciously well (sans reverse geer, but that's another
story). Parked at Hilton Park services, got a flyer from a fellow camper left
under the wiper (the flyer, not an actual person). Pitched okay, walked
around, settled in for night.

Saturday morning I got up early (for a Saturday, that is) and looked around
the trade and autojumble stalls for a gearbox and other bits and pieces.
Found one for £30!!!! And all gears could be selected. About 5-6 others as
well. Back to van, fitted little bits onto carburettors, started up
(clouds of smoke), tuned it a little. An amusing Scottish bloke came over
and offered his opinion (which was warmly received). We got chatting, etc
and he diagnosed my exhaust by smell as running far too rich (choke stuck?)
Whilst he was talking I got out the digital gas analyser to prove it was
bang-on 1.5% CO. Got it idling nicely, despite the fact that it has no
fuel cut-off solendoid in the idle system (how does that work!!!?????)

Saturday afternoon: visited Just Kampers, where I got my gearbox which
didn't have a reverse (it was secondhand). Arranged for Pete to look at it
later. More browsing, etc. Bumped into a friend from my VW Club (which
didn't attend in any official capacity). Isn't it funny how you always
bump into someone you know? Met with Pete from JK and he had a good look
at the gearbox - conclusion: bad box.

Saturday evening's entertainment's could only be described as &quot;entertaining&quot;!
Then back to the camper with friends. A chance meeting with a rather
attractive red-haired girl certainly brightened up the evening. Sipped
Martini in plastic wine glasses with cocktail umberellas is an experience
you don't really associate with Vanfest! Then we went to the Scottish bloke's
camper and met some more Scottish people - they had a guitar and we played
and sung songs 'til 4 in the morning! Sorry to all my fellow campers for
inflicting this upon you!

Sunday was roastingly hot and I had a lazy start. Then more browsing the
trade stalls and checking out the extremely high quality show vehicles - they
just get better and better, don't they? No particular favourites (they're all
good) but I do have a soft spot for the 2.4 diesel Eurovan with about 19
strobes and lots of other lights, magic paintwork (I want some like that!) and
the obligitary high-powered stereo.

Then it was time to say our goodbyes and join the inevitable convoy of bays,
splits and others trundling home on the busy motorways. In all, a very enjoyable
show, well worth the effort, great weather, bought a stack of parts to fit over
the coming months and I'll definitely be there next year!
