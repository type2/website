Subject: [T2] Disturbing tranny sound

Folks,

My 78 bus is singing a new song that worries me.

Once in a while, the bus makes a chattering sound when I depress the clutch
pedal. The chattering sound slows down as the engine slows down. The
chattering sound is most probable when the bus is going downhill or
decelerating.

When I release the clutch pedal, the sound goes away and doesn't return for
a couple of days.

Any ideas?
