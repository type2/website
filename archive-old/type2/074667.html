Subject: Searching archives for thread &quot;1600 into a 74 bus&quot;

I remember this recent thread, but cannot seem to find
it in the archives.  I searched &quot;type IV engine type
I&quot; and came up with one of the postings.  This gave me
the title of the thread.  But a search for that title
did produce the appropriate responses.  It seems to
search only the body of the post, not the title.

Is there a better way?

Is there a monthly archive kept somewhere, beyond the
few weeks kept on the type2_dot_com website?  

I enjoyed occasionally just browsing through old
postings on the vanagon_dot_com website, where you could
read all the posts of Octomber 1994 if you wanted.
