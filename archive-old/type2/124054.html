Subject: Re: [T2] Dual Port - What does that mean?

T,
Dual ports mean there are two intake ports on the cylinder head (one for
each cylinder). Easily identified by looking at the intake manifold where it
enters the head. Single ports split the intake inside the head, dual ports
split outside the head (you'll see a split in the intake runner just befor
it goes into the head). Basically, this provides for less restriction it the
airflow between the carb and intake valves, providing more power at higher
RPM's.

Subject: [T2] Dual Port - What does that mean?


&gt; Hey, I won't know till I learn, and it's confusing me because I
&gt; understand things from an 8 valve vs 16 valve or even 20 valve per four
&gt; cylinder world. But from PORTS I know nuttin.
&gt;
&gt; According to the Samba Online VW Dictionary;
&gt;
&gt; &quot;Refers to the number of individual intake passages into the head.  Dual
&gt; ports have 2 per head&quot;.
&gt;
&gt; So, any body want to 'splain in words of few syllables?
