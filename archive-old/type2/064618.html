&gt; &gt;no engine bucking on hard acceleration when cold).

&gt; &gt;He has been in the Volkswagen business for sometime so I assume he knows

&gt; That's a lot of money, even Canadian.  The disadvantage to the single carb
&gt; is the long pipes needed to get the air fuel mixture to the heads.  I've
&gt; heard of people having bad icing problems with a single carb.  I wouldn't
&gt; do it without also rigging a way to get some heat to the pipes in the cold.
&gt; I think you would be better off with some high performance dual carbs and
&gt; manifolds.  I'm kind of sold on the stock carbs at this point - they have a
&gt; lot of advantages, the main one being that they are STOCK.  If you decide
&gt; to swap, can I have your old Solexes?  :-)

Good point, David. I did one of those conversions about 10 years ago, on 
my '73. The performance did seem to be better (or maybe it was just that 
it created a bunch more noise when that secondary kicked in).

Starting was another thing all together. When temps would drop below 50, 
starting the engine became a ritual.

Push the pedal to the floor and release. Crank the engine while giving a 
couple partial pumps. In 5 seconds, the engine would catch on 2 
cylinders. Now keep just a bit of pressure on the throttle. In 5 
seconds, the third begins to fire, followed by the fourth a few seconds 
later. Now the choke will keep it idling quickly. Turn on the lights and 
rear window defogger to put a load on the engine.

Grab the squeegy and run around the van, wiping off all the dew. Back 
into the cab, and give the throttle a quick &quot;blurb&quot; to drop the idle 
back down... and away you go, slowly. After a few blocks, it finally 
responds to acceleration properly.

Now I'm not sure what the acceleration is with the stock carbs, but I 
was pleased with this setup on the freeway. Above 2500 RPM, the 
secondaries really came into play, and it put both my old 65 and my 
Corvair to shame. Mileage wasn't noticably different, but then I used 
those secondaries a lot in passing. 

If you go with the conversion, I learned there were two types. Mine 
consisted of an intake manifold adaptor, some cheaply chromed tubing, 
and a cheap looking carb mount. 4 chunks of rubber hose and 8 hose 
clamps connected everything together. There is supposed to be another 
kit available that is made of cast aluminum with a secondary tube which 
allows heated air to preheat the tubes.

In cold climates, as David said, you will probably experience icing. I 
also saw a delay when &quot;punching&quot; the carb, because the fuel mix has to 
travel a long ways through these oversized tubes. I've done several carb 
replacements w/ Holley-Weber and Weber carbs. Most of the kits are not 
as easy to install as this kit is... and most offer &quot;raw&quot; performance, 
(ie 20+% increase in power at full throttle) as opposed to the smooth 
power delivered by your standard carbs.

If you choose to go with this kit, you can still buy it for a very 
reasonable price (under $400). Installation is just a matter of pulling 
the old carbs and linkage. From there, it's about 2 hours to hook it all 
together, with tools you probably already own. The only difficulty 
involved is if you decide to rejet the carbs... and I doubt the mechanic 
will include that as part of the installation.

I did mine because the stock carbs wouldn't idle. Given it again, I 
would probably do it... but I'd try a bit harder to get the stock units 
to run first. Balancing carbs isn't difficult... but must be done 
regularly to get the best performance results.
