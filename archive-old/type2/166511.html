Subject: Re: [T2] baptism in fuel

Indeed. I received my sanctification one 105: Sunday last July, in the
O'Reilly's parking lot. Total immersion, too, thanks to the fact that they
sold me the wrong fuel filter. I had to call my wife to bring me a change of
clothes and a couple gallons of water to hose myself off with. Bonus points
for emerging from beneath the bus, completely soaked in fuel, to find a
woman parked next to me smoking a 'gert through her open window. By that
point, though, fiery death seemed like a viable alternative...
