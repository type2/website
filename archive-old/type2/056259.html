Subject: stuck washer
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

anyone know how to get those copper exhaust washers out of the
head?
one of mine seems to have welded itself in, although it doesn't
look melted anywhere.

another guess is that the PO had used a washer for a different
head, it looks more snug in its cavity than the other washers.

Peace,
Thom
