Yes.  You have a one year, single state (CA.) only bus.  I know b/c I have one too.
Assuming the bus was brought into the new world through California, she is catalyic
equipped.  As far as I know, that was the only difference.  Being that she has a
catalytic convertor, the exhaust is unique to 1978 only and California.  Check to
see if your exhaust is there, specifically the crossover pipe.  The crossover pipe
is the single unique part that is not replaceable new or remanufactured.  If you
have it, hang on to it.  The crossover pipe connects the right heat exchanger to the
Y pipe which is also connected to the left heat exchanger and the catalytic
converter.  Anymore questions, just holler...

&gt; Hello all,
&gt;
&gt; I just   purchased a 1978 westy. The odometer says 54,000. miles. The
&gt; seller said he thought that was correct but was not the 1st or 2nd or...
&gt; well you know . But the bus itself is is pretty good shape. It has some
&gt; rust but runs strong. Its  first home was in Calif. now living in
&gt; Florida.
&gt; My questions are 1. What are some of the things that might give me a clue
&gt; as to the correct milage?
&gt;                 2. Were the Calif. smogged engines any worse than their 49 state
&gt; counter parts?
&gt;
&gt; BTW I own a locksmith business
