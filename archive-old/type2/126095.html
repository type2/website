Subject: Re: [T2] Hidden Danger in Low Mileage Tires

Hi John,

The Brand isn't significant in this issue... Age affects all tire 
brands pretty much equally. Read the article and learn to read the Date 
0f Manufacture code and you'll be able to avoid finding out that the 
price really WAS too good to be true...

Happy trails,
