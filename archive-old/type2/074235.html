Subject: Re: 78FI on a 76 2liter

oh, I have an ENTIRE FI setup to swap out, including the AFM.  I'm just
wondering if the engines are the same.  or if there are engine specific
tuning, like relating to the cam (hydro/solid).

&gt; Mike,
&gt; 
&gt; The ECU and AFM's have a different letter suffix to the part numbers for
&gt; each year (75 - 79). This implies that they are not identical and may not
&gt; play together.
&gt; 
&gt; A more obvious problem may be if your 76 is an early 76 I believe that the
&gt; AFM has a 6 pin (rather than 7 pin) connector. Your 78 will surely have the
&gt; 7 pin configuration. This of course effects the connector to the AFM on the
&gt; wiring harness as well. This change is to accomodate the air temp sensor
&gt; integrated into the AFM.
&gt; 
&gt; My advice: Give it a try - if the connectors match it may work - I doubt you
&gt; could do any harm by trying this. If you have the AFM for the 78 you could
&gt; swap that as well.
&gt; 
&gt; Good Luck!
