&gt;Well it gets better...
&gt;The other day I was in The Home Depot here in Canada and I came across a

&gt;Sound familiar?

Yeah, very familiar.  I bought a roll of this same stuff at that very Home
Depot you mention (assuming it's the one in St. Catherines).  I applied it
to the rear floor of my bus above the engine compartment, and the results
were disasterous.  It became very soft and actually started to run, and it
smells like tar.

I have most of the roll left, free to anyone who will pick it up from my
garage in Dallas, Tx.

&gt;BTW I took that piece of material home and ran some bench test on it with a
&gt;heat gun.  The stuff begins to deteriorate/melt at temps much
&gt;higher than what sunlight would produce in our vans.

My tests indicate otherwise, and I wasn't even in Texas.  I put some on
immediately and before I got out of Pennsylvania it was a mess.

Sorry Mark.
