Subject: 6V splitties

Is anyone but me still running 6V in a splitty? I think I need a new battery,
last one I bought was at autozone 6 years ago, but they no longer carry them.

I'm getting frustrated with the thing not starting reliably despite a brand
new 6V starter and new #2 cables from the battery to ground and the starter.
The battery is old but passes a load test. Engine is fresh, but no harder to
turn over than other vw engines I have. The symptom is the solenoid engages,
but the starter turns very slowly (approx 30 rpm to 0 rpm depending on how 
long I've been cranking it). Amazingly, sometimes this is enough to start
it. Usually however, it requires the spousal unit to apply force to the rear
of the vehicle while I pop the clutch.

This is becoming tiresome for both her and I. I like the fact that my 63 van
is totally bonestock, but I'm contemplating conversion, or worse.
