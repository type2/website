&gt;I am putting rebuilt axles in Dharma (1970 Westy)
&gt;The new axles have a ridge on the metal part of the cv boot
&gt;so that I cannot instal the bolt retainers. I guess I am calling them the
&gt;right name.

The problem, you bought cheap boots.  Frankly I'd return them.  It
is unwise to use them without the retainer/washer/whatever you
want to call it.  It is hard, the lock washers you better also have
under the cap screws are hard, they will eat into the cheesy
boot flange steel like its butter.  Later they will loosen up, that
isn't fun.

Seriously, you got taken on the boots, send em back to whoever
and b*tch, good German with correct flange should be $10 or so
a good HDI poly boot with correct flange $6 or so if you look hard.
Advanced or Autozone used to even sell the HDI with grease for
about $10.
