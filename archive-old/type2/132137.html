&gt;&gt; Ok, this is odd. Greg's bus should not run with the afm plug
&gt;&gt; disconnected,
&gt;&gt; or so I thought.
&gt; 
&gt; If what you say is right, Scott (and I suspect that it is), then the
&gt; unplugged idle should cease if Greg clamps both ends of the fuel ring.

Indeed. I was going to do this step, but I wasn't in the mood to take my
experiment any farther. It goes to show how little fuel is needed to make
the engine idle.

I seem to remember Greg saying he had done something tricky with the tank.

&gt;&quot;The fuel tank now has a splitter that will accommodate the fuel return line.&quot;

This may be the reason for high fuel pressure. If it is a tee type situation
with only one branch into the tank, it can't work as a return line, as the
fuel will be trying to flow in both directions at once.
