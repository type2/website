&gt; I was worried about the position of my dist driveshaft too, so i checked
&gt; Wilson, and all i found was how to set endplay/washers on the bottom of a
&gt; type1 dist driveshaft. Nothing about *where* the shaft goes with respect
to
&gt; the drive gear on the crank. Did i miss it?

Wilson's book gives instructions on putting the driveshaft in the case half
as part of a
rebuild.  Lots of folks have reported that, following Wilson to the letter,
they ended
up having the distributor driveshaft off 180 degrees.

You should be able to tell if the distributor driveshaft is in basically OK
by turning
the engine over to about TDC on the compression stroke of #1 and then
looking
at the rotor of the distributor.  With the distributor in its &quot;normal&quot;
position, the rotor
should be pointing, more or less, at the notch in the rim of the
distributor.  If it's way
off, or you can only get the rotor pointing at the right place by wildly
twisting the
distributor away from where it &quot;should&quot; be, then it's likely the shaft is
not inserted
properly.

&gt; Is it true that as long as the cam/crank relationship is right (dot on cam
&gt; gear between the two on the crank) all should be well?

No, you still have to get the distributor driveshaft inserted properly
relative to the
crank/cam.  It can be off a tooth or so one way or the other and you'll
probably
be OK, but no more.  I'm not sure what kind of engine we're talking about
here
but on my Vanagon engine I know I couldn't get things timed right if the
shaft was
off by more than one tooth; there's just not enough room to &quot;swing&quot; the
distributor
to make up that sort of difference.

&gt;
&gt; There is no 'backwards' for the dist drive gear or the driveshaft, right?
&gt; Right?!?

I'm not sure what you're saying here.  With the cam/crank timing properly
set, with
the engine at TDC of #1 cylinder's compression stroke, there's a &quot;correct&quot;
way the
offset slot in the top of the driveshaft should be oriented.  You can drop
the shaft
into place up to 180 degrees off, so yes, there's a &quot;backwards&quot; way to do
things.
