Having taken holidays in combi's campers etc. I got fed up of the lack of
storage/head room. Even a pop has no room with the bunks in place, with my
wife &amp; I both being about 6' it has been a pain in the neck! We now have a
factory high-top &amp; it's excellent with an opening from the bulk head behind
the seats right to the back, above the cab is a HUGE storage area &amp; we have
a tall unit in the camper. I was worried about fuel economy as petrol is
more than £3 ($5 US) per gallon! But on the high-way I got better MPG than
the combi's in the convoy.
