Subject: Brake drum saga continues...

Oh wise ones...

Ok, right now we are continuing to sweet talk the brake drum as we search
our area for a puller to rent that will work (no luck). We're oiling it up
and tapping and oiling and this thing is not moving. We will continue the
search for the elusive puller and continue to simultaneously freeze our
butts off and annoy the neighbors with our piercing clanging (the only plus
in the situation).

This is the life. :-)
