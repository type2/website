Subject: RE: Serious problems with gas

Hi Nik,

	What you have are two problems caused by the same thing.
Is your pump electric or mechanical. And if it is, is the pump located
closer to the engine than it is the fuel tank? 

When I first got my 73 VW Bus, it still had it's original lines. it had been
repaired in a number of places. I was using an electric Purolator / Bug Pac,
4 PSI fuel pump (in place of a mechanical one). The car could barely move.

Top speed was about 45 miles an hour. I ended up replacing ALL the lines with
steel lines (that I bent myself). The problem completely went away and the 
car EASILY picks up speed to 65 miles an hour.

The problem is that air was being sucked in through the lines. The lines
were soo old that air was actually being sucked through them. So...
basically, I wasn't getting enough fuel for the motor to really work
well. My fuel filter (clear glass one) was also identical to yours..
It would sit maybe... 1/2 to 3/4ths full... while it's running.


Once I replaced the fuel lines with steel tubing, the problem completely
went away and the clear filter is totally full with fuel (without even a
bubble in it).

By the way, as I was removing the old fuel line, it basically crumbled
in my hand, which was really quite scary because imagine if it had
dumped all over my motor while I was driving down the road???


Needless to say, your lines are probably totally shot. The ones that I had
were rubber lines but they had this fabric / braided covering on them.
My recommendation is to replace all your fuel lines with new ones and I
guarantee to you that this problem will go away.



By the way, many people on this list will probably scrutinize me for this,
but... I'm going to say it anyway. Those old rubber lines are horrible.
In my opinion, instead of spending all that money replacing them with
original replacement lines, buy yourself a 4 foot length of steel fuel line
and bend it yourself. The car will perform MUCH better with steel lines.
Rubber lines compress under pressure (even as little as 4 PSI) and you get
much better consistent flow with steel lines. 

The steel lines will also pretty much last the life of the car.


It's my opinion that unless you plan on doing a concourse restoration
on your car, you should go with steel lines. I use the steel lines all the way
from the fuel tank, to the electric fuel pump. I then use another piece of 
steel fuel line from the fuel pump, to a fitting on the glass fuel filter.
From the fuel filter, I connect a rubber hose and it goes from there directly
to the carburetor (I only use maybe a foot of new rubber line).

 
Hope that helps...

&gt;Subject: Serious problems with gas
&gt;
&gt;One of my VW's is out of commission as of this weekend pending resolution of
&gt;some really weird stuff going on with the fuel system. Any help you guys
&gt;can provide would be a boost, as I'm not well acquainted with some of the
&gt;parts involved. My symptoms (1970): Started to lose power, and response to
&gt;throttle. At the same time, start smelling raw gas. Actually, I seemed to
&gt;smell gas here and there for about a week prior to the power loss. OK, so I
&gt;limp home and open engine compartment, no gas smell here, but the clear fuel
&gt;filter is almost empty, making me think gas starvation. So then I check
&gt;under the fuel tank, and notice fuel steadily dripping out a tiny hose
&gt;straight from the tank. Fuel hose going back to engine seems fine. Open gas
&gt;lid and see the compartment is full of gas, even though the cap is on,
&gt;weird. So I went back to engine, pulled the out hose from from fuel pump
&gt;and turned the engine a few times. Fuel would squirt but only on every 3 or
&gt;4 turns. 
&gt;
&gt;I have a few ideas but there seems to be more than one problem- the fuel
&gt;delivery and the fuel leakage but they must be related.???
&gt;
&gt;1 Fuel line blockage?
&gt;2 Bad pump/ pressure regulator?
&gt;
&gt;Any theories?
