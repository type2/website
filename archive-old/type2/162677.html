Subject: Re: [T2] Strange engine

Being the usual &quot;keyboard mechanic&quot;, i'd guess the idle jet got clogged
somehow, or some other carburetor induced trouble. Do you have a spare
carb to swap in?

I'd suppose a vacuum leak could cause this, if you have any places where
one could develop.

(I can tell you stories about the carb on our '65 icing up)
