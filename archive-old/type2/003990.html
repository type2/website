Subject: Steering box fault found (scary)

This is one of the ghost stories you can tell around the cam fire!

I changed one of the rear brake hoses &amp; adjusted the rear brakes on the
camper I took the BA6 out of. Replaced the front pads (quite bad pitting on
the disks), this has sorted the brakes, so no major surgery or cost  :)

As for the steering box, I took the bus up on the ramp, removed the front
belly pan that covers the box. Hoping that the slack was a ball joint or
track rod end I started from the wheels &amp; worked to the box.
No slack, dejected I tried the operating arm that sticks down from the box
pinion &amp; it came off the pin in my hand! Still attached to the drag link
that goes to the centre pin. The large lock washer &amp; 36mm nut were gone, not
loose but gone! Dug around in the bits box &amp; found a spare washer &amp; nut. Now
it's all snug with little play, while I was under I found the cause of the
un-equal lock. The bolt that restricts lock was so loose that it had wound
out enough to restrict right turns.

Anyway the brakes are good, the steering is tight &amp; the engine is tuned.
While I was at it I swapped 2 wheels that were a bit bad 1 was buckled
without a commercial tyre &amp; the other had a bulge on the inside edge. A
couple of holes in the chassis legs so I welded them up now she's ready for
the M.O.T test on Monday, all that work &amp; she's not even mine!

Having said that, it only cost a few £'s/hours to put all the wrongs right,
but the dealer couldn't be bothered.

SO REMEMBER DO _NOT_ USE &quot;ARCHIES&quot; IN WEST LONDON. They use a symbol of a
Kiwi (coz they are), with their customer service they might consider the
dodo!

If any-one is interested this bus is being re-sprayed this month &amp; will be
for sale for about £2500 &amp; is located in London near Hampton Crt.  It's
a 't' reg LHD 1600 dp Devon with gas/elec fridge, hob &amp; grill (I want a
grill) full length pop with matching roof rack over the cab. I REALLY like
the interior &amp; the top bunk is REAL nice with an excellent canvas (I think
it has been replaced as it's so good &amp; made of thick rubberised fabric). All
the body work is good &amp; the mechanical should now be spot on, if I have not
noticed anything the MOT station will, they are VERY strict (as I like it,
makes me thorough &amp; safe).

Peace.
