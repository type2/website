my $.02,
besides the fact that the lights are smaller so
visibility is somewhat lessened i dont think you would
ever have any problems.   i  have always modified my
my vehicles and have never had any problems.  i drive
a lifted J$$p with all kinds of modifications
including non stock tailights with no problems at all.
 with all the street rods and lowriders out there with
shaved tailights, blackout kits etc, etc, i highly
doubt any would be johnny law would say &quot;hey isnt that
a 76 VW Westfalia?   Those tail lights look pretty
suspicious, arent they from a 69 westy?  Please step
out of the car!&quot;   just kidding, but honestly i doubt
anyone besides a vw nut would ever notice the change. 
 i say go for it.
