Subject: RE: [T2] How do I......now pos feedback for Bus Depot

Just thought I'd give a pos feedback for Bus Depot. They are a bit slow on the
shipping side but they have great assortment of parts some of which are really
hard or sometimes almost impossible to find anywhere else. Good prices and
good parts means I'm happy to be patient for my box from UPS.

I've used them for years now and will continue to do so.  Whenever I've had
any sort of problem they have been excellent in Cust Service.


-Daniel
