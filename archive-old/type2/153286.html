James- the only stupid question is the one you didn't ask. This list is here
for discussions on what is best for our buses. Of course, there will be
different opinions. Take the one you are most comfortable with and go. BTW
always trust Karl's advice, never seen him wrong yet.... Ted

Don't take life to seriously -- you'll never live throught it....
