Subject: Re: [T2] fire talk

Earlier today I read bussies in numerous listings arguing and ranting over
insurance and light-heartedly said...
&gt; &gt;Holy cow...we are a hot-headed group sometimes!

Then the T2 Administrator said...
&gt; You are not helping anything with quips like this.
&gt; In addition, all posts must have bus content - this one had none.
&gt; -David
&gt;   Type2 list administrator

I read at least a half dozen rants about insurance, then others ranting
about others mentioning insurance...no bus content...then a light-hearted
remark about how argumentative we can get sometimes gets the administrator's
attention. At least I now know what it takes. We can handle that us bussies
that have such deep capacity to love those smiling busses can seem to at a
moment's notice turn on one another can't we?

By the way, last night I watched the movie The Journey, www.thejourney_dot_com.
If you have not yet seen this, you simply MUST. You can watch the short
version of the film on the website.

I'll try to behave myself in future writings to this list...and if I make a
post without bus content I'll make sure it's critical of insurance companies
[just kidding, okay]...;-)
