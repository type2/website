By High School I'd already been driving everything from logging trucks to
farm tractors for several years, but Driver's Ed. was a requirement for
graduation.  I already knew the teacher well as we had a couple of common
interests outside the classroom.

So when things progressed to discussion of automotive mechanical systems we
arranged to demonstrate internal combustion engine operation by going beyond
the cardboard cutaway of the 4-stroke cycle and using actual, running, 4 and
2-cycle single-cylinder engines [ otherwise known as model engines :-) ].

Things were &quot;buzzing along&quot; nicely, despite the considerable noise generated
inside the classroom and radiating out through many adjacent rooms and
halls, until I moved from the 4-cycle engine to the 2-cycle engine
[understand that a 2-cycle demo _was_ necessary - one of those kids might
have bought a SAAB someday].  The amazingly large and dense cloud of exhaust
smoke generated by the one-lung 2-cycle engine triggered a school-wide fire
alarm, and the structure was emptied in record time.  So much for the
advancement of scientific knowledge in the minds of the future leaders of
our community.

The school and fire authorities were so relived to find the commotion was
caused by a classroom demonstration gone slightly sour that no disciplinary
or punitive action was taken against the alleged perpetrator[s].

OBC:  If all the smoke emanates from the tailpipe, your air-cooled VW engine
is exhibiting &quot;controlled burn&quot; characteristics...
