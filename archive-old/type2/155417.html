Subject: real deal german heads

someone is selling type 1 single port cylinder heads that are stamped  
&quot;Lmb germany&quot;. does this necessarily mean they were made in germany?  
they have no cosmoline, and come as a 10 pack in a wooden crate.  
should i be suspicious that they are not actually made in germany?  -
