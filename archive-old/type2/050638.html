Subject: [T2] JB Heaters in CO

Does anyone in Colorado know if JB Heaters is still in business?  I have
been trying for 2 weeks with no answer.  If I let it ring long enough, the
message &quot;your call cannot be connected at this time&quot; comes on.  I even
tried to call information and ask them if the phone number was working.
Information said that phone number listed in Hot VW's does not have a
listing.

I have a cold bus and really need some South Wind parts, does any one know
of another source?
