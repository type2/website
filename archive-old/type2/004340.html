Subject: Friday-Miller FI

I sent this yesterday, but it was kicked back by the filter, so let's
try this again.

Volks:

Being friday, I thought those of you interested in the CIS fuel
injection system would like to see the response I received from the
satisfied customer of Miller FI.  I'm really thinking I can piece
together the parts and do this myself.  I'm an engineer and really don't
know any better;).  If anyone wants to discuss this further, please
contact me.

P.S. Someone previously posted about conversations with Gary of Miller
FI. Could you please contact me back channel(messages are not in the
archives yet).

Hello Shawn,

Sorry it took so long for me to get back to you.

The Miller FI has been wonderful.  Yes it is quite a bit more money than
even the best carb set-up, but it is miles ahead in performance and
worry free operation.  I have been using my 64 Bus as daily 
transportation for the last 4,000 miles or so.  The FI has performed
flaulessly.  I havn't had to make a single adjustment on it.
In the morning, with the cold start goodies, it hops to life on 
the very first revolution and I don't have to depress the accelerator.
The motor is so quite at idle, sometimes I can hardly hear if it is 
still running or not.  On the freeway, I am passing people and wishing
I had a 5th gear.  The engine noise at freeway speeds is drowned out
by wind noise.  The engine has so much torque at low RPM that I can
let the car creep up hill without my foot on the gas. It feels very much
like a diesel car in that respect.

I am getting about 20 mpg in the city with a 1776cc engine and I am a 
real lead foot who lives on a hill.

Where do you live?  If you want a test drive, you are welcome to try
my bus.  I live in Portland Oregon.

Sincerely Robert Piacentini.
