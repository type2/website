Subject: 68-71 Bus' have upright motors, but can you&gt;&gt;&gt;

I know these are upright motors, but what is the
difference (if any) from a Type 1 motor..??

Otherwords, can you simply take a motor from a bug and
bolt it right up to your bus??

The only thing i can think of that would be different
is the bottom motor bracket.. but then again im just
generally familar w/ the T1 motor and still learning
about bus'..

peace,
rob
