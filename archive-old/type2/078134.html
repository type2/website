&gt;             I am fairly new at the bus scence but I am well aquainted with 
&gt; the bug scence. i have just completed hooking my engine(1700) back up in my 

what year is this bus,  your signature says a 77, a 77 had a 2litre Fuel
Injected engine stock?!

&gt; westy and i went to start it on saturday and the thing backfired and fire 
&gt; started coming out of the intake(im running a weber progressive on it). well, 

why are you running a weber progressive??

&gt; i adjusted the timing on it and got the ol' bus running again. Went to start 
&gt; it this afternoon and it did the same thing again. fire shooting out the back 
&gt; of the intake somewhere. once again scared the crud out of me. got the fire 

sounds like timing is off.

&gt; out and there was no substantial damage done. im thinking that since i
&gt; don't 
&gt; have any exhaust on the bus right now that its backfiring because of that as 

need to have the back presure of the exhaust system to get it running
right.

&gt; i've had similar expierences with backfiring with my bug, but with no fire 
&gt; though. any suggestions? thanks a bunch for any responses! 

. BUY A FIRE EXTINGUISER
. get a Bentley manual for your bus
. put exhaust back on
. consider putting the Fuel Injection back on
. replace all the fuel lines
. check timing
. replace the .009 distributor (bet you 10 to 1 you've got one) with the
correct vacuum dizzy

good luck
