Subject: battery birthdate
Message-ID: &lt;0.7bf13d3f.252e6dc7_at_aol_dot_com&gt;

The battery in deed has its birthdate on it.
If not a sticker, it is engraved on the top.

For example, the sticker may say B-6.  The B means February(A is Januray, B 
is February C is March etc.) The 6 is 1996.  7 would be 1997; 8 would be 1998

I say a battery lasts 3 or 4 years and then is on borrowed time.  
 
BTW if no sticker reading B-6(or whatever) the engraving may read B6GFD.  
Again the B6(first two numbers) will decipher birthdate....who knows about 
the GFD part.
