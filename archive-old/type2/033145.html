Subject: Re: Regular vs Premium

as far as i know, premium is better for our vans. they were designed with
something like 91 octane in mind (i think that s what it says on the inside of
my gas cap flap =). and premium is 92 (?), whereas the others are 89 and 87
(?). but really, i don t know all that much about this, i m hoping someone will
correct me if need be (good chance =) hope everyone had a good thanksgiving!

To sorrow I bade good-morrow,
And thought to leave her far away behind;
But cheerly, cheerly, She loves me dearly;
She is so constant to me, and so kind.
