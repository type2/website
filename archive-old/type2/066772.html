Subject: Starting problems: fuel pump

I have posted before describing my starting problem.  My '76 2.0 starts 
slowly in 
the morning, but catches after 10 sec or so.  If it has been started 
recently, it starts right up - even if the engine was running for only 3 
sec. A lot of people proposed the fuel pressure.  My fuel gauge is a 
cheap one that only goes to 9 psi.  But I could tell that the pressure 
did not build up to 30 psi for several (maybe 10?) seconds, and within 10 
seconds of shutting the car off, it went to zero.  So I took it to a 
mechanic for a fuel test.  (Ryan's Imports in Northampton, MA - Very cool 
people.)

He said it was the fuel pump.  It did take several seconds to get to full 
pressure, and it dropped back to zero too quickly.  He confirmed it was 
the pump by getting it up to pressure, clamping the line from the pump to 
the engine, and shutting it off - it now did NOT drop to zero quickly.  
He said it was the check valve going bad in the pump.  These can be 
replaced individually, but he did not have any from older pumps.  He said 
that this is a sign the whole pump will go out soon, so I should order 
another, which I did.

According to him, this is a common problem, and ways to figure it out are 
that it should take longer to start in warm weather than in cold 
weather.  In warm weather, one should hold the pedal to the floor when 
starting, but in cold, do not touch the pedal (when you have this 
problem).  

But none of this explains why it starts right up if the engine has been 
started at all in the last hour or so.  Obviously, the fuel pressure is 
not still there.
