Subject: Re: [T2] T1 Oil Flow Animation, Anyone?

Hi Mike,

All I have is the schematic on p. 102 of Fisher's How to Hot Rod VW
engines. But you probably have seen that....

 Oil of you -

 Subject sez it all. I'm looking for the path that oil would take from
the re-entry of a full flow ystem until the oil/pressure hits the
stock oil pressure sender. In particular, is that oil that hits he
stock oil pressure sender still filtered (from the external oil
filter)?

 Oh, and if anyone knows of a neat oil path animation, I'd love to see it.
