Well I made an unsuccessful attempt at a valve job the other night. I 
noticed it was louder than it was before so I assumed that I set them too 
loose. I went for a drive around the block and all of a sudden the engine 
died. I got towed it home later and had a look and saw that one of the lock 
nuts for the valve clearance had come loose on cylinder 2. I just went out 
and re-set the valves again and made sure that they were all set right and 
that the lock nuts were tight. When I try to start it the engine won't idle. 
It will rev if I put my foot on the gas but it still dosn't sound right as I 
do this. I think I did something serious to the engine when the lock nut 
came undone. It was the lock nut on the exhaust valve, so this would mean 
that exhaust couldn't escape, could this have damaged my piston? If this is 
the case what can I do about it? I am starting to doubt my mechanical 
abilities right now and am getting really frustrated.

TIA...
