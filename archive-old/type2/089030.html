Subject: Re: Fw: [T2] Broken Easy Out

Yup, That was my error for misquoting.
I can't imagine that they use cobalt
for Easy Outs, but everybody else
carried the error so i let it ride.
I can only add that i have only seen two styles-
One is square, and one is twisted left-hand.
I assume they are only stuck in the largest area
of the taper, and agitation would break it loose.
Heat, air compressor maybe even tiny drill holes
adjacent to provide relief. Thread repair kits
can go more than one size up if needed.

&gt; The easy out is discribed as heat treated alloy steel. The drills I am
&gt; trying to drill it out with are cobalt steel.
