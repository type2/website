&gt;     Hi,
&gt;     1. I've searched all over but can no longer find the website that
&gt;     features a 1970 Westy manual. Can someone direct me to that address?

&lt;http://thesamba_dot_com/vw/type2/literature/manuals/manuals70westy.htm&gt;

It's a page within a larger framed site called &lt;http://thesamba_dot_com/vw/&gt;.
Great site!

&gt;     2. Is it possible to put the two-person upstairs sleeping arrangement
&gt;     from a later loaf Westy in the earlier style pop-top that's hinged at
&gt;     the front?

I have a '69 Westy, and I was wondering about that as well. I'm guessing
there must be a space problem, as that's probably why they swapped the
poptop around.

But that's just a guess...
