Subject: RE: Ezee Brake bleeder kit from IPD

&gt;From the description, this system just applies air pressure to the
reservoir.  the air doesn't actually enter the system.

What I would be afraid of is the chance of blowing the reservoir or the
lines to the master cylinder.  they weren't designed to take pressure, and
30-year-old plastic isn't known for its resiliance!

&gt; 
&gt; How does this work? Using the air from a tire is scary. Why? Moisture. Often
&gt; there is moisture in there. When you go put air in your tire, most locations
&gt; will put moisture in there also. Will this not taint the brake system?
