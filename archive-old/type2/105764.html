Subject: Re:Update to suddenly noisy exhaust on 75 bus 

My '76 two liter pancake has a smog reducing device that pulls exhaust gas 
from the muffler and injects it into the intake plenum, so that it goes to 
all the cylinders along with the mixture, and gets burned.

I cut off the pipe between the muffler and the plenum. I sealed the 
resulting muffler opening with a bolt, held in by JB Weld.  The JB Weld was 
temperature-rated for 600 degrees Fahrenheit.
Years later I discovered a Permatex material that handles much higher heat 
ranges....see web site below.

Heads run at temps below 600.  Oil in those same heads gets as high as 300 
degrees, and the metal in the heads run hotter than the oil temps. I think 
the 600 degree JB Weld would be OK in your application.  Be sure to look on 
the JB Weld tube label, for the maximum recommended temperature. I have 
seen JB Weld that is rated for 400 degrees, so it isn't all the same.
RTFL.....read the full label.

Permatex makes a whole line of gasket and sealant products that you might 
want to review, before deciding to go with the JB Weld.

To consider the one I used for my exhaust manifold, check the Permatex 
site. The stuff is rated at 2,000 degrees (probably overkill):

I posted here about the suddenly noisy exhaust in our 75; the engine
rebuilder over the phone assumed it was a pulled manifold stud.
However, someone posted that generic rebuilt heads may have plugs where
some smog pump was located for each cylinder, (used in a year like 74?)
and apparently the bolt he had placed in the #2 hole had worked loose-I
hand tightened it and the noise went away. Builder suggested muffler
cement on the bolt; would JB weld work on it?
