Subject: Adjusting brake rod length when replacing power booster in a
  mid to late bay

I haven't looked in Bentley yet because it's in the bus in my garage and
I'm at work.

how does one go about adjusting the length of the shaft that connects the
bottom of the pedal to the front of the booster to the correct length? I do
have a power bleeder so I should be able to bleed the brakes before
adjusting the push rod length. Is there a procedure/measurement or do I
just adjust it until it &quot;feels right&quot;?

I was looking for a picture of the setup but found nothing on bus-boys or
busdepot. The part is in the bus so I can't search on the part number at
the moment.
