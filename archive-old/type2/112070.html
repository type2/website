&gt; Hi Folks,
&gt;
&gt; I've been dealing with a strange rear end noise on my Bus, and am tearing my
&gt; hear out trying to figure out what it is.  Symptoms:
&gt; Rumble-rumble-squeak-squeak noise over level ground, clunk-clunk over bumps;
&gt; noise only on driver's side rear.  So far, I have replaced the wheel
&gt; bearings and both CVs on that side, but the noise is still there.  I've
&gt; checked the shock mounts and all the suspension fittings, and all are tight.

I would still shift the shocks side to side.  Shock mount bushings going
bad can feel tight as a drum to hand pressure and still sound like this.
You just cannot exert the 3000 pounds of force that the bus can.
Shifting them costs nothing except some sweat and if the problem moves
with the shocks, then you know to replace.

&gt;   I have not checked the torsion bar, but there is no grease leaking out of
&gt; any place near it.

There is no grease in the torsion bar, just some talcum powder to ease
installation.

                             OOK!
