&gt; Yep, the stock sink and stove was a one piece unit. Your's looks to have
&gt; been a non-deluxe model. Does it have the fridge or an ice box?

It's a Canadian P22 model. I've know for a long time that the stove didn't
match the US P27 model but I don't know when it was installed and by whom.

&gt; That looks like a stove out of an earlier SO42 Westy or Dormo.

You also have a Campmobile 70 plate at the base of the rear seat by the fire
extinguisher?

&gt; Here are some fantastic pictures of the interior of a Westfalia

Those were cool. More pictures here:
