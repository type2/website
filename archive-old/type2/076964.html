Subject: RE: [T2] Slider Hinge Link Assembly

Mike,

A complete hinge is universal. The individual pieces change in '76 though.
FYI we sell complete rebuilt hinges for $75.00. Just bolt in in and
shhhhhhhhh pop! it's shut.

Subject: [T2] Slider Hinge Link Assembly


Hiya All,

The hinge link assembly (1970 Bus) on the rear of my sliding door is kaput.
The spring appears to be broken and the whole unit is making grumbling
sounds when the door is moved.  Looks like it's time for a new one.
So..............the question is:  Is the hinge link assembly a universal
part for 68-79?  Which is to say, are they all interchangeable?  If not
which years are compatible?
As always, thanks for giving your knowledge to the needy!

Mike
