&gt; Since the milage talk I've been wondering when I would
&gt; have to pop for a new motor.  I have a 79 automatic
&gt; Champagn Westy from California which had an engine
&gt; rebuild about 121,000 miles ago.

Compression test, oil pressure test etc etc. You can ball park the engine
health using those tools. It won't tell you exactly when you'll need a new
one but let you know what condition the current engine is in.

&gt; I've since put a ton
&gt; of money into new ball joints, starter, gear shift
&gt; innards, fuel lines (of course), tranny rebuild,
&gt; shocks, throttle cable, etc. etc.  all done by my
&gt; local mechanics.  It's my daily driver and I travel up
&gt; and down Vancouver Island every two weeks over a
&gt; couple of minor mountains keeping speeds between 50
&gt; and 60 mph (except on the Alberni Mountain where I
&gt; can't get above 20mph).

With that cool sea air and low elevations, the engine should be fine.

&gt; I need a paint job and a new tent top but am afraid to
&gt; go for it in case I'm going to need a motor rebuild
&gt; instead.  

Wise.

&gt; I would welcome any information/wisdom re how much I
&gt; can expect from this motor.  I've only owned &quot;Muriel&quot;
&gt; for  a year and a half so I can't say if it's the
&gt; original motor.  
&gt; Thanks and I love everyone here!

How's the used parts situation at the junkyards?
