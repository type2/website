&gt; Hell, I too, wish I could be in a VW based business of my own!
&gt; But, years ago when I owned a boat, I was standing in the yard
&gt; of the marina I kept it at,said to another boat owner, &quot;Would'nt
&gt; it be great to own a marina?&quot; The owner of the marina overheard
&gt; what I said and burst out laughing. He said &quot;Owning a marina
&gt; and enjoying boats are two different things. The only time I
&gt; get out on a boat now is when I have to tow one in!&quot;


That's the truth!  Before I started The Bus Depot, I often worked on my own
busses.  I was putting a few hours a week into fixing up my '63 deluxe
microbus &quot;project&quot;, as well as working on my daily drivers.  Sometime this
month I'm finally going to bite the bullet and have the '63 towed to the
local garage for the transaxle swap it needs. It's been two years since I
parked it in my carport until I had a free afternoon to tackle the job.  I'm
finally realizing that if I keep waiting for that free afternoon, the bus
will remain off the road until the carport falls down around it!  Meanwhile,
I took the bumpers off of my '89 Westy two years ago to paint and refinish
them - and they've been off ever since for lack of time!  So ironically,
selling bus parts has resulted in the gradual deterioration of my own busses
due to lack of time.  Then again, I can't complain, because running the
Depot is a heck of a lot of fun in itself, even if it doesn't leave time for
much else...
