Hey I posted last week about a n  oil filler tube for my 80 engine in my 74 
westy and  Karl out in Fresno sent me one  for FREE!  What a swell guy!  
Anyway the tube didn't fit:(  It seems that this tube  is  the holy grail for 
me.  I think I may have fixed it today with some jb weld.  (fingers crossed)  
Also anyone notice that bus in the y2k movie last Sun.  and in  Toy Story2 
one of the cars in; it looks like a  chopped top bus!
Thank you list!
