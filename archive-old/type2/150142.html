Subject: Re: [T2] seat

Hi Neal,

Do you have a 76 camper, or are you trying to put a swivel seat into  
a bus that doesn't already have one?

I have a swivel section in my parts stash, but it will only fit in a  
bus that already has the swivel base welded in at the Westfalia  
factory. I had to pillage that part from a wrecking yard in order to  
install a swivel seat into the westfakia.

&gt; I have posted this before, IM still looking for the part on a 76 vw  
&gt; camper
&gt; that allows the passenger seat to turn to face the rear of the bus,  
&gt; thanks Neal
