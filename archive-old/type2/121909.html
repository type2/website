&lt;&lt; On a similar note, I've never watched the TV show Dharma and Greg
before... but my TiVo happened to record it so I thought I'd watch it.
The ENTIRE episode takes place in a bay window Bus. The two of them get
stuck in the snow, and they spend the entire show talking inside the Bus.
It's her Bus apparently, and she's has the floor all done up with shag
carpet. Pretty cool! 
 &gt;&gt;

Actually (if that word can be applied to a TV show), it's her father's...
It completes the stereotype...Her father being balding and ponytailed;
somewhat addled (or stoned, your choice), politically leftish and still
blaming most things on the Nixon administration and other conspira-
cies...(he's also a vegetarian unless there's meat within knife's reach ;-)
He's also the same stereotype sitting in a lawn chair (with orange VW 
in the background) in the New York State Lottery commercial...
