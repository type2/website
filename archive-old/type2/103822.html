Subject: quick friday question

i know that fri. questions are still supposed to be bus related, but i just 
need some info. can anyone give me some good web pages that talk about the 
1600 engines. I just bought a bug, and since its only my second vw, and my 
first one with an upright, i need some help. I do have the haynes for my 
year, so thats not a problem. i was just curious if anyone could give me a 
place where i can find some more info on them. expesially intake and the 
parts of the intake manifold. well just anything. bombs away you guys!. 
thanks. and oh yeah. this could also be useful to the early baywindow guys 
too. so im not really violating the rules! alright. enough babble. bye

joey
