Vic/list,
In my limited experience and opinion, the 74 1800 is the best non-hyd lifter
engine vw made. It has the largest intake valves and most have sodium-filled
exhaust valves.  It is, in the words of one listee, a 'peppy little engine'.
All 74 1800s were carb'd - they were the final evolution before the
introduction of FI in 75.  I think the 1800 likes the 2bbl weber conversion
better than any of the other type4 engines.

One of the advantages i like is that you don't have all of that FI wiring
harness to contend with in a 74 chassis. More like a type1 engine electrical
system and much simpler to troubleshoot.

Another is that the FI stuff just isn't there so it can't fail and give you
&quot;...why the hell does it start and then just die...?&quot; sort of mornings when
you're late for work or whatever.

Plus, you get to bond with your engine every few thousand miles during your
valve adjustment. VW engines like to be bonded with.  They'll commit suicide
if they don't feel loved - and even then sometimes they're not that happy
about things...

If you pop a big FI 2-liter in that 74 chassis (it is 74, right?), you have to
add all the FI peripherals (wiring harness, ECU, etc.)- ask Joe Fournier about
this. Of course Joe would probably tell you it is easy but i think he is the
type of cat that would climb Everest and then say &quot;...yeah man, you should try
it. Great for the lungs!&quot;. Thats a joke, Joe. ;]

Build a 2-liter if you have the money and time and, if your cam is worn to
'unacceptable core' status (see Wilson) you may be forced to go 2L if you
can't replace it. List, correct me if i'm wrong, but i beleive
you can have a worn, carbed cam ground down to FI specs?
 
It basically depends upon how much money/time/blood you want to spend on the
thing,  -and i don't just mean the cost of the conversion - i mean the &quot;we
can't figure it out - it just won't idle...&quot; bills your mechanic will be
handing you. Of course, if you work on it yourself, you'll be getting the
&quot;where were you saturday?&quot; inquiries from your friends, loved ones and anyone
else that remembers you as a normal person before you climbed into the engine
bay of a VW bus, never to be heard from again...
&quot;...he used to be such a nice guy...&quot;

This opinion comes from someone who still considers FI a bit confusing because
of the complexity of the system and all of the electrical issues in comparison
to carbs.

my humble nickle,

Clark in Ky.
