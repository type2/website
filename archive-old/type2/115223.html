Well, that may have been part of the equation, but there was more to it that
that.  One of the pleasures of driving a bus for me is knowing that I am
driving a machine that is 30+ years old, and was built to be repaired and to
last. I cannot think of any other vehicle where the manufacturer has chosen
this path so clearly, when the programmed obsolescence that other
manufactures chose (and it could be argued that VW eventually chose), made
so much more financial sense.

Think about it: If VW was only trying to make money, why build the way they
did? How much money has VW made from your bus still being on the road, when
you and your PO, and his/her PO, and his/her PO could be buying new ones?

There are other motivations other than The American Dollar, at least for
some of us.

Have a great weekend everybody.

Cheers,
Matthew
