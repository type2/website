Subject: RE: Starter.

Do you have a relay in the starter circuit?, If not thats why the dash
lights dim as there is too much power being drained. Bet the times that it
failed were when the weather was colder right? 
This is also the reason the std ignition switch fails as there are too many
amps drawn through the switch. Fitting a relay wud solve this. I think there
are articles in the archives about fitting a relays to the headlights. The
same principles applies...

BOL


&gt; &gt; I have a not so new problem.  I have a 74 bus and the switch at the key
&gt; &gt; quit working to engage the starter.  I di all the usuall tests and
&gt; &gt; comfirmed that the key switch was indeed my problem.  Next I hooked up a
&gt; &gt; starter button from the battery to the button and then to the statrte
&gt; &gt; seliond.(bad spelling).  It works about 87% of th etime.  The other
&gt; times I
&gt; &gt; get a small click from the starter.  The dash lights dim like it pulling
&gt; &gt; juice but the starter does not engage.
