List,

I want to lower the CR on my 74 1800 type4.  It has dome top pistons in it.
Don't ask how they got there.

Original shims were .025 at the head and .008 at the case = .032 total shim
height.

I figure i could replace the .008 with a .015 and just drop the CR a bit.

I know about the VW bulletin advising removal of the head shim and
compensating for loss in deck height with cylinder shims and will not be
taking this advice - head gasket stays.

No science here, i have no idea what the CR is or should be and frankly i
don't think it matters - i just want to drop it a bit in the hopes of running
a little cooler.

I know that the stock 75 FI 1800 bus engine i tore down had .025 at the head
and .008 at the case and was running std dishtop 93mm mahles.
Mahles are worn, so i can't just switch em out.

I know that i should use one shim against the case rather than a stack of two
.008's .  Anybody ever run a stack of shims under the cylinders?  Did it
leak?

So, my question is, where can i get a cylinder shim for an 1800 that will
retain a height of .015 after everything is torqued down?

Money is definitely an object here...

thanks,
-clark in ky
