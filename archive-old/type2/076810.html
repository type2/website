Subject: 009 and GEX


It's rare I can offer my experience to the list as I'm not very
knowledgeable but in these two instances I can.

Bought a 78 camper with a 2L hyd GEX engine with approx 30-35K on it, stock
dist. My mechanic was not impressed with the GEX engine, though he had one
of their posters on his wall. I had him do all the timing etc on it since
it wasn't running good and he discovered it wasn't fully advancing and the
mounting plate was stripped. He couldn't find a rebuilt one and a new one
was $$$ (this was about 7 years ago I think) and he knew I was cheap so he
offered me to put in a used 009 very cheaply. I imediattly noticed the
hesitation he had warned me about, but as he said &quot;Since the 2L has enough
torque to pull until it advances, it shouldn't bother you&quot; He's right,
except for city driving I don't mind and I don't do hardly any city driving
in my camper. As long as you drive it aggresively (I think Muir had term
for this style of driving) it's fine. With a smaller engine in the heavy
camper I should think it's more of a pain.

Yes I am planning on replacing it with a stock distributor, my mechanic
thinks that's a good idea, except I have a pertronix in 009 (his
reccomendation) and I would be throwing away that money. As a plug for this
mechanic, when he put in the pertronix he forced me to learn how to put in
points, gap them and static time the bus so it would run, since as he said
&quot;when the pertronix dies the bus dies and they do, so you need to be able
to get it running again&quot;. It was a painful experience for both of us, since
he was looking over my shoulder, offering advice at the top of his lungs
&quot;No no, your going f**k it up, didn't you see how I did it? Am I wasting my
time here? Stop being an idiot and do it the way I did it!!&quot;. Took me 3
tries to get the bus running.

OK on to the GEX, that lasted about 10K for me, so 40-45K total. It dropped
a seat on #3, and my mechanic rebuilt it. He is like Doktor Tim only more
abrasive. He showed me what he found in #3, seat dropped, head cracked, a
big gouge in the piston, but no foreign object. He assumed they left
something in there when they assembled it, spun the crank and it jammed so
they pulled the head and reassembled it. He rebuilt it with the original
case and crank (case wasn't align bored which surprised him) new P&amp;Cs, Mark
Stephens heads, etc etc. Price included 2 return visits at 500 miles and
1000 miles for oil changes, timing check, head torqueing which cost another
$100 and wasn't negotiable. I have no idea what my HIOP is, but I have
never seen the oil light flicker.
