Subject: RE: [T2] City/Battery aux. battery panel

It's probably just rusted.  Hit it from the rear with some CRC or Liquid
Wrench and let it sit an hour or two.  The internal ball-bearing will
loosen up and it will work again.  Also, I think it's possible to open
them up, allow you to clean and grease it.

Subject: [T2] City/Battery aux. battery panel


Hey all,

Does anyone know of a source for the switches on the fridge control
panel,
battery charger panel or whatever it's actually called? The power switch
on
mine a pretty much frozen. I can use the fridge but the power on/off
switch is
really stuck. So rather than risk breaking it I just leave it on city
power so
it doesn't drain the auxiliary battery. Not a big deal yet but I'd like
to
replace the switches or the whole panel ideally since the charger
doesn't
work, but have had no luck so far on The Samba or the Bus Co.

Any suggestions?

Thanks, Doug
