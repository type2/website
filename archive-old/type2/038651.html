Subject: Noise reduction

Hello Type 2 Listers:

I just wanted to share my most recent repair/upgrade on my '76 Campmobile.

Last week I installed a new muffler (aftermarket, bought at my local VW 
parts store-$125, plus hardware &amp; gaskets).  When I started the engine the 
noise level was just about the same as with the old unit.  I had visions of 
having to replace the heater boxes at great expense!

I decided to check the bolts at the exhaust ports that connect the heater 
boxes to the engine.  3 of the 8 bolts had worked loose enough to require a 
couple of turns each to snug them up.  The engine noise has been 
considerably reduced by this little fix.  It served as a reminder to me to 
periodically check the integrity of connections to reduce leaks, noise, etc.

I have also sandblasted, painted and replaced the weatherstripping on the 
front fresh air flaps.  I've documented that small project with pictures and 
will post them later today for your info.

Thanks for all the help this list provides.

Best regards,
Walt Fogle
'76 Campmobile
