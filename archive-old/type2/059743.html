&gt;&gt; 2.  There is a port on each of the manifolds and the guy I bought them
&gt;&gt; from says to connect a rubber hose from one to the other.  Anybody know
&gt;&gt; if this is right and if so, what the heck is it's purpose?  And should I
&gt;&gt; disconnect it and/or plug it while balancing the carbs?
&gt;
&gt;This tube is to keep things balanced (I've been told). I have a tube
&gt;there and my engine runs really smooth. I also T into the line with my
&gt;crancase vent. That saves me the trouble of making some sort of
&gt;connection at the air cleaner. 

That will make you run lean since there is no fuel going in with the air
that comes out of your crankcase.  For that reason it's better to attach it
to the air cleaner.
