Subject: VW CD - Defeat?

Well, the marketing guys asked me to take down my VW-CD page.  Seems they
think that nobody really wants a VW CD, saying that we could probably only
sell 300 or so of them, which I think is bullshit, but you know the
marketing types...

Anyway, here is my response to them.  I haven't heard a response from them
yet to it, so this should be interesting...

&gt;Regarding the VW CD:
&gt;
&gt;Several months ago, after getting my own copy of the product, I 
&gt;approached Arnold Gold about the idea of making a version that
&gt;covered air cooled volkswagens back past '82.  He indicated that
&gt;he didn't know how much support there would be for it, and that I
&gt;should talk to Jonah.  I went to Jonah with the same proposal, and
&gt;after some discussion, we decided that any inquiries would be 
&gt;directed to him, and stored in a mail folder.  I told him I would
&gt;do a web page, with a &quot;mailto&quot; to him.  After Jonah moved,
&gt;I was directed to forward the requests to Jeff Lagges.
&gt;
&gt;Due to the number of people who knew my connections with VW's and
&gt;with Alldata, I wrote up a web page describing what Alldata did
&gt;and how wonderful it would be to have the same product for earlier
&gt;cars.  That way I didn't have to keep typing up response after
&gt;response when people asked me about the product.
&gt;
&gt;It appears that nobody took me seriously, and now that it is 
&gt;evident that there really _is_ support, everyone has panicked.  
&gt;Also consider the level of response in proportion to the number
&gt;of people who even _knew_ about it.
&gt;
&gt;Nobody, not even myself, has done any real market research to determine
&gt;if this is viable or not, and I think its irresponsible to just
&gt;toss out some numbers and say its not feasible.  Look at the number
&gt;of people who work on VW's compared to the number of people who
&gt;would actually even think of working on their 1996 Ford Explorer.
&gt;If the target of the Consumer CD is really consumers, then I think
&gt;you have to realise that not everyone with a car less than 10 years
&gt;old is going to do work themselves.  How many of _you_ actually
&gt;do any of the work on your own cars? Yet the product is probably
&gt;available for all of the makes and models you own.  I think the
&gt;size of the aftermarket for VW parts is representative of the
&gt;number of people working on these cars still.
&gt;
&gt;I know that a similar attempt was made to support the Macintosh.
&gt;
&gt;So, for the time being I will remove the link.   I tried.
