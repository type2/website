Subject: Valve adjustment

Ok List,

Here is an easy one. I want to adjust the valves on my type I for my 68 bus.
I am quite familiar with the standard of finding TDC adjusting #1 and going
counter clockwise. 

However, I am interested in doing the adjustment in two steps rather than
four. What two sets of valves can I adjust at once without turning the
engine? Is it #1 and #3, then #2 and #4? I know it is something like that.

Please enlighten me.

Thanks,

Matt (Of bad bus Karma fame)...
