Subject: F-F-F-F-F-Frozen van drivers

My van (1973) used to be so cold that my hands would cramp up, when I turned 
the heater on the windscreen would mist up.

Until...

I removed the false bottom that bolts on to the middle of the chassis.
The heater pipe runs down the middle (if it's rotten plastic drain pipe makes a
good replacement) at the front end there is a 'Y' junction. There should be a 
tube attached to it that will go through the front cross member do a U turn 
and go to a pipe above the middle of the frount of the cross member - this is 
the feed to the very small floor level grill at the rear of the walk through. 

VW make this tube out of cardboard which of course rots away; mine was missing 
completely - all my heat was warming the road. I replaced it with some flexible 
aluminium tube 4 foot at 60mm diameter (yes a different size to the tube in the
engine bay, why?) it has to be long because of the route the U bend takes.

When I turned the heaters on I was greated with a blast of dirt and enough heat 
to demist and warm the van. 
Its a big space so it still doesnt get hot. Retrospectively I think it would 
be better to block of the tube at both ends to get all of the heat into the cab.

Also forward of the front cross member the heater tube is uninsulated so will 
be losing heat to the road.

I hope this warms you up!
