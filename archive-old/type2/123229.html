Rob,

I *still* think that it is really ugly and hope that when they &quot;tweak&quot;
the looks of the production vehicles, that they change something.

I know some of ya'll like it, but I can't stand it.

I'd take 3 stock restored mid 70's for one of them.
Maybe 2 stock restored with Jake Raby engines and fully operational
air-conditioning.  I know how to add cruise control and the other
&quot;modern&quot; stuff.

Payments of $579/month at $30000 would restore a stock van
in about 2 years...with almost all  virtually new parts.

Think about it....while you spend another $579/month on the other one
for the next 3 years for a total cost of *not* $30,000, but $34,740

Cheers, dave
