Subject: Help me start my Westy(79, not FI)

All,

I have been having a devil of a time trying to get my 79 Westy started.

This is not fuel injected. It has a single Weber progressive on it.  

The symptoms are as follows:

The engine cranks (and cranks, and cranks...)
It does not fire.
There is a strong petrol(gasoline) smell, if I pump the accelerator
pedal too much.
When I pull the coil wire off of the Dist. and hold it next to bare
metal I get a blue spark.
Plug wires, cap, rotor, points replaced with past 2.5 months
Plugs replaced within past 5 days
Coil replaced withing past 2 days

Help!

David

The best defense is a strong offense...
I intend to start offending.
