Subject: Re: [T2] Tach Questions

Bus boys sells a bracket made specificly to mount an aftermarket tach. in
the clock hole. I think its listed on their web site along with the size of
tack needed.
ronnie c.

&gt; I was at my FLAPS today and looked over the selection of tachometers. Can
&gt; anyone tell me what size the clock mounting hole is in a 74? The
&gt; off-the-shelf tachs came in a variety of sizes; the pertinent ones being
&gt; 66mm and 85mm. They are both made by Sun-Pro. Will either of these fit
&gt; without serious modification?
&gt;
&gt; Opinions, facts and wild conjectures solicited.
