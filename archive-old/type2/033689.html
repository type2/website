Subject: I've got to move

well, my 63 is sitting outside with FROST on it!! simply because Stella
is in the garage being the cheery b!tch that she is 8-)
she frustrates me.
I guess I put the wrong pressure plate in...the one that has the disc
that meets up with the TO bearing.  so pull the engine AGAIN! jeez.  how
depressing.  I'm supposed to go and do things and she gives me all
this.  The things I do for her.

just wanted to let eveyone know my status... if anyones listening.

btw... does anyone that lives in a WARM climate care for a roomate ;)
this arctic crap here in WI really bites.

I picked up a 71 for a friend tonight...froze my toes in the
process.....  what is it with me and my friends and 71's?  me, keri (my
friend who just got the 71 ..she lives in town here) stephen white, dan
in IL who used to have 2, and the list goes on.  was 71 a boomin year?

and those ceramic 12V heaters...there was one in the bus I picked up
tonight.  absolute junk.  waste of space.  I could barely tell a
difference between the outside air and the &quot;heat&quot; out of that thing.

well...off to bed with sore arms and a heavy mind that doesn't want to
think about engine pulls any more.

a 71 trans can accept a 9-spring pressure plate right? no ring on the
pressure plate to meet the TO bearing though right?

jeez...

later

-71 weekender - Stella - being her usual self
-63 standard with frost on him.  (I'm thinking Herman....maybe a
suitible name...who knows..time will tell)
