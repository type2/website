I've spent hours even days screwing with rusty cv bolts.  The quickest and
easiest method I come up with is cut the heads off the bolts with cutting
wheel then pull the joint off then use vice grips to turn to rest of the
bolts out.  I don't even waste time trying any other methods on rusty bolts
anymore.  Just pick up some new bolts before hand.  Just my 2cents.  Marcus
