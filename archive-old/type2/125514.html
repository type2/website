Subject: GREAT Bus Awning for just $119!

This is a brand new awning, unlike anything offered for a Bus before. It
has a ton of flexibility at a very cheap price.  It was over a year in
design and I must say that it is the ultimate inexpensive Bus awning.  I
am very happy with the way this turned out. I'm already using one
myself! 

It packs down to about the size of a gym bag and attaches in minutes
without any mods to the bus. Its domed roof prevents rain accumulation.
You can optionally get weighted feet (or make your own) to allow it to
be used in a parking lot without the need to stake it down (for
tailgating, swap meets, etc). Another optional adapter allows its use on
a vehicle without a rain gutter (truck, van, SUV), still without any
mods to the vehicle.

I have about a dozen available now, then no more until late June.

You can see lots of pics and info at
