Cool, Marvin...

I just bought the Yokohama load D tires for $55 .

Surprise!!  Tirerack sent me load C tires.  Twice!!!

On the third time, I got my load D tires.

You know, I had both the Yokohama C and D tires in my garage at one time, 
and side by side, I could not feel any difference.  The sidewalls seemed to 
be the same in depth and firmness, by touch.

The load range D say  8PR, while the load C say 6PR.

But the 8PR have ONLY six ply, as stated on the sidewall.

Could it be that the 8PR have a larger load ratine, simply because of some 
testing, and NOT because of a difference in construction.

The 8PR is rated at 65 Psi, and the 6PR is at (I think) 50 Psi
