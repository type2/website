Subject: Re: VW shop near Waco

Waco Garages:
 
my '79 camper is currently sitting at TG's having the engine rebuilt...it is on 25th about a block or two before Bosque...Tommy is good as well as his son...Keith
 
Ray Wheeler has a place in Elm Mott close to the World Hunger Farm...it is right on 77th...however, the couple if times I have been by, there was no one there...apparantly he was just recently in the hospital...so I am not sure if he is still in business
 
fianally...people keep telling me about a guy in Lorena that is very good at what he does...never been there so I can;t tell you where his shop his...nor can I recall his name...
 
those are your options here in Wacko...what do you drive?...maybe I have seen you around...I am in the camper painted like the Mystery Machine
