&gt;
&gt; Man, this has got to be a tough way to make a living.  I can't  believe that
&gt; someone is going to pull a tranny and deliver it for $50, even if they can
&gt; get it for free.  Shysters in the yards I go to want $100 to pull either an
&gt; engine or transmission, and that's just part time $$$$ for them.

All I know is that every time I go to any of the Pick-n-Pulls around here the Bus trannys are always the first part to be gone. I think someone comes in on a week day and takes any
that are there and I think the yard gets about $50 so they must be worth more than that to a rebuilder to make it worth their while. The guy that does the transporting to the
rebuilders also gets his cut so I'd guess that if you deliver a tranny to a rebuilder in person a Bus tranny would have to fetch around $100 for those 2 guys to make any money.
Awhile back I was able to get him over to my house to pick up a bunch of Bug swing axles I had laying around and I think I got $25 each for them. He's got a huge flatbed truck
that's probably pretty well filled up by the time he hits all of the various shops around the state.
