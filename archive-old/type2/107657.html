Subject: Fuel Pressure Regulator

So I spoke with my father-in-law tonight about my new 78 in Manitoba.  He
tells me that he took it to a garage to have them investigate why it seems to
be running rough (this bus is Currently in Manitoba and I'm in Eastern
Ontario.)  Apparently, they were lookin' around it things and tried pinching
the line from the fuel pressure regulator to see what effect that had.
Apparently, when the put vice grips on one of the lines either to or from the
Fuel Pressure Regulator the bus seems to run well so they deduced that needs
to be replaced.  Does that make sense?

jdd 60 std (with a nice 28 pict carb)
      78 westy (i'm not lookin' forward to FI.)
