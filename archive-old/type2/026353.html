I guess I'll add my $0.02 too...
	I would suggest to ANYONE choosing to operate a gasoline heater in
their VW to draw fresh air into the vehicle when heating.  Unless you live
in sub-zero temp zones, the unit will still cinge your eyebrows drawing icy
air into it.  the heater was designed to safely draw clean, fresh air into
the vehicle.  I wouldn't take chances of suffocation, especially in a
camping situation where you might be sleeping.  Might be the BIG sleep
otherwise.

Hi all,

I just wanted to clear up something...

I am a big fan of Gas heaters, I'm not saying dont install one, they are
great and I have one to put in my bus too :)

All i'm saying is gasoline is dangerous, use caution, and wether VW did it
or not, dont run gasoline into the passenger compartment :)

take care,

Steve
