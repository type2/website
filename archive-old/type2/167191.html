Subject: RE: [T2] Mind if I smoke?

I've encountered this with several aircooled VWs. Engine leaks oil in places
where its so hot it burns, then the smoke comes out the intake vents.

It's not good but doesn't mean that your engine is going to blow up either.

-Daniel

&gt; It smelled like oil, I just have no idea why else the smoke would be coming&gt;
out.
