Subject: Ingnition coil abuse
Content-Disposition: inline

Following the (fairly) recent discussions on ignition coils, here's some
experience I've just had.  My bus was sometimes difficult to start and would
sometimes run rough and also sometimes stall.  So, new points, condenser,
dwell, timing and tighten all ignition connections.  Check spark from coil,
nice white/blue.  Bus runs very well until about 14 miles then power drops
and it cuts out.  Wait 15 minutes and you can drive another 14 miles and the
same thing happens.  Repeat as necessary to get home!
Later I check everything and things seem fine.  So I go for a run until it
cuts out, check coil spark, yellow.  So I figure that the coil cops out when
it heats up after the 14 miles, letting it cool takes you on and so forth. 
New blue Bosch coil cures the problem.
Doktor Tim mentions that it is usually abuse that kills the coil.  How is
this achieved?  When I checked the gap of the old points (prior to me
replacing) I noticed that the gap was very small, 0.15/0.20mm possibly less.
 With new points and dwell test the new ones are 0.35mm.  I think the small
gap was done by the garage MOT inspectors to get the emissions down(?) so
that the bus could pass.  Could this small gap have &quot;abused&quot; the coil and
made it fail?
