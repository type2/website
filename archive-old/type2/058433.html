Subject: Re: timing screwed up

&gt;A friend that just bought a bus (standard 1600 upright motor) didn't 
&gt;check the timing before he pulled the distributor to inspect the 
numbers 
&gt;on the back and when he put it back in, he timed it &quot;correctly&quot;.  

I can't say for sure that your buddy's problem matches mine but it 
sounds the same...
I put my motor (1600DP) together with a used vacuum advance dizzy, and 
it ran great...for a few months.  I began to have trouble with the 
advance and after finding out what a new vacuum dizzy would cost I 
pulled new 009 off the shelf in my garage that had a compufire 
electronic ignition in it.  (left over from an abandoned Bug project)
I couldn't get it to start or time for the life of me.  After several 
fruitless attempts, using Muir and Bentley, I finally went back and 
started from scratch.  I checked the position of the wires, verified TDC 
for #1 then reinstalled the 009 and shazaam! It worked, still is.  All I 
can figger is that I placed the wires incorrectly from the get go but in 
the right order, and somehow managed to get the timing on with the 
vacuum dizzy.  
My advice is to start from scratch, use the Muir and/or Bentley and 
check the placement of the wires, find #1 at TDC and go from there.
good luck,
