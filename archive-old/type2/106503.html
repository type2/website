David, 

It is a good question. I don't think there has been much development in this
area, as performance type IV engines would typically be built with solid
lift cams. My earlier point was not that the engine couldn't be made more
powerful with hydraulic lifters, but that you don't have very much choice in
cams if you go hydro. Web Cam can and will make any profile you want, there
is a set-up charge of about 150.00 if I recall correctly.
