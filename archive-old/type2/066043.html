Subject: co-ownership, welder

Hey:
Ken Hooper wrote that he would like to do the collective ownership thing 
with a welder. Well, I have a welder, and would dearly love for someone to 
show me how to use it well. (My welds are apparently serviceable, but damn 
ugly.) Anyone on the list would be more than welcome to avail themselves of 
my welder provided they gave me a few tips on its use. Oh, the geography 
thing. I live in Wisconsin.
