Time for another boring Safety note,

EYE PROTECTION, WILL NOT HELP YOU FIX YOUR BUS!

But it will stop the doctor anethasizing your eye &amp; going in with tweezers
(eeeeuww).

However there is one tool not mentioned in either first aid kits, or Muirs
phase 1 tool kit. I can testify (I believe- OOOhhhh yeeeaarrr), that this
product has applications with stuck/sheared bolts, burned heads. In large
enough doses, can even relive limb severance.


This product is of course BEER! put one in your tool box TODAY!!!
