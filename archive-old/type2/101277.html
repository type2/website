Subject: Vanagon 3rd seat and AC stuff4U

List members,

I'm lightening my load. I have a brown vinyl 3rd seat that is in excellent
condition, zero rust, seatbelts not included for anyone who just wants it.

Also I have a nicely done aftermarket AC system that was in my van. E-mail
for details.

This stuff is located in Seattle, WA and as you have noticed, they are not
priced......por gratis.....take em away.

Craig
