Subject: Need help synchronizing dual Kads on single Cab

------=_NextPart_001_0001_01C187EF.B0027890

Volks,
I got my 1970 Single Cab running with a freshly rebuilt 1776 that i did m=
yself.  The problem is with the single cab the bed is low over the engine=
, and when you put a redline synchrometer over a dog food can on top of t=
he carbs, you cannot read the doggone needle to dial the carbs in.  =20

The motor runs fine until put under load and then it pops and such for th=
e carbs are not synchronized.


I figure someone has come up with an effective fix before I raid the  har=
dware store in the AM.  =20
