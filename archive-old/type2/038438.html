Tom,

I think (&quot;think&quot; is the critical word here) if they FIT on the dual advance 
dist and with each other they will probably function also.  I have never 
actually compared part # listings on these items as I have switched and 
swapped them over the years and I've never run into noticeable problems.  It 
is possible the condensors may need to match some other aspect of the setup, 
(coil?, plugs?) but I have never cross referenced them and am strictly an 
amateur dabbler in auto ignition engineering. ( I know just enough to get 
myself into trouble!)

I have heard some claims made that the best use of a .009 is as a source of 
rebuild parts for stock distributors, so there must be a fair amount of 
functional interchange of parts.  At some point, though, you will probably 
alter the perfomance of the stock unit to some extent, ie swapping weights 
and springs.
