&gt;It's not a Dometic, I can't remember who makes it.  Anyway, it looks
&gt;like you could take any small fridge (i.e. Dorm/apartment fridge) and
&gt;wedge it in the cabinet, cut off the plug, and hook it up to the AC/DC
&gt;inverter inside the cabinet.  The fridge I had when I was a freshman had
&gt;no problem freezing a case of beer after i forgot about it. :(
I think your problem here is that '71 Westys came with an icebox, NOT a
fridge.  So if you're waiting for it to cool on it's own, it may take awhile.
Late Oct./early Nov. in these parts, at least...  ;-)
