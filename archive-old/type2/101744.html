Hi Folks,

I think any compression under about 80 would be pretty bad, but I'm not sure 
if it would keep it from starting.  If it has good pistons and the valve 
train is working, it should at least run, but it will be very weak.  In any 
case, it sounds like a good candidate for a rebuild -- check out 
www.aircooledtechnology_dot_com for a look at some engines to dream on.

As for the spark plugs, you are one of those unfortunate 1972 T4 folks who 
doesn't have a top hatch on your engine compartment.  As a result, your job 
is even tougher.  I have a tough enough time getting the #1 spark plug in 
from the top.  However, if you have one of those spark plug sockets that has 
the foam or rubber insert to hold the plug, at least you'll minimize the 
risk of dropping one...

Good luck, and enjoy that Type IV engine!
