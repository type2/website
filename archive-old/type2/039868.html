Subject: Re: LP gas tanks under bus

Actually, the easiest way is to, , , , , ,
FIRST, make sure there is no flames or sparks ANYWHERE NEAR where you are working.
NOT in a garage where there is a hot water heater nearby.
THEN, turn on the gas at the tank, WITH ALL OTHER VALVES TIGHTLY CLOSED.
Then take a solution of dish washing soap and water, and liberally paint it on all the connections
and hoses.
Be sure to cover ALL of the rubber hoses. Look for bubbles. If there are ANY bubbles, you have a
leak.
This is what the professional gas people do.
BTW, remember, Propane is heavier than air, and will lay in low spots.

I'm an Electrical Engineer, and gas just scares the hell out of me. That's why I always have a
second
person there with me when I do it. Mainly for safety, but also to watch for my mistakes.

&gt; &gt; My 72 HighTopper has the built in LP gas tanks, but I have never used this

&gt;
&gt; you can have the tanks checked professionally if you don't feel
&gt; comfortable doing it yourself, I am sure a camping trailer or motorhome
&gt; service facility would be able to do it or direct you to someone.
&gt;
&gt; if you do it yourself I would start with an inert gas.   Charge the system
&gt; with CO2 or Helium or Nitrogen to check it out.   put a presure gauge on
&gt; it if it doesn't have one and let it sit for a week and monitor the
&gt; presure, it should not fall by more than a lb a day MAX.  then check all
&gt; the lines and the appliances.  after your sure everything works
&gt; mechanically and is sound I would put a &quot;minimal&quot; charge in the tank and
&gt; OUTSIDE with all the windows and doors open go through a test of each
&gt; appliance, wear a face mask and cotten clothes, including long sleeves
&gt; when doing this..  soapy water is the best leak detector. DON'T use an
&gt; open flame.!  Keep a BC rated fire ext handy.
