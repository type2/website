Subject: Re: [T2] Koni shock bulk purchase

&gt;From: ARoman4047_at_aol_dot_com


&gt;I'm not familiar with the extension/compression distance on the Koni
&gt;for the type 2...On some other cars, however, the Koni can bottom
&gt;out (no more compression), and the adjustable feature of the shock
&gt;is lost and it remains at its last setting...


Tony you must be talking about the intial test runs when installing them to 
try out the different settings. Otherwise why would you need the choice 
after installing them the way that you want them. Do you not have to pull 
them off to adjust them. They sound more like one of those Rotisserie 
Cookers on TV &quot;Just set it and forget&quot;. From the posts earlier my take was 
that they only had two settings anyway. Of course I could be wrong.
