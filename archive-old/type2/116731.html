Subject: kids and seat belts

This a more relaxed bus question for friday.

On long trips do you let your kids out of their seat belts
to do things.. I guess what I am asking is if it's night and
they are wanting to sleep... Do you take them out of their
booster seats and let them sleep in the back?

I have this personal dread involved doing it but I want to.
The bed in the back with the z-bench still in chair position
is still large enough for them to both sleep sideways.

I know when I was young seat belts weren't a big deal
but my kids are so used to them it's not an issue.  What
do the other parents do? And why?

I know some people say that it really doesn't matter in a van,
you get into an accident and everything flies everywhere and
could hurt the occupants regardless if they are in their seatbelts
or not.  But it also keeps them from coming forward in the event
of a collision.

Thoughts?

James
