Barry,

If your looking around for some nice DC fixtures, at resonable prices,
this is the place to go.

http://www.rv-solar_dot_com//lighting.html

I added a couple of florescent fixtures  in leu of the incadesent bulb
fixtures---

Wow !!

Big difference!!

And I have run them most of the night every night on a weekend campout,
on one battery with no problems.

Good Luck,

Terry

Mike, 
I saw your post about watts and amps and 12 volts. 
The Trak Auto store has a fluorescent droplight running on 12 volts. It
is rated as 8 watts and says it draws 0.5 amps. 
From your post, this sounds about right, 8 watts = 0.5 amp draw. 
Number #1 question: If I had a fully charged battery when I pulled into
a camp site, how long could I keep the 8 watt/ 0.5 amp drop light on
before I drained the battery too low to start the fuel injected VW? 
( I know, it all depends on the battery, but just assume some nominal
figures on the CCA, ambient temp, that you base the estimate on )) 
I just want a glow to see by, but I would be afraid to fall asleep with
the light on and drain my battery. Would I be able to start the VW the
next morning?? 
Ball park figures!?!? 
Number #2 question: 'about' how many lumens would a 7 watt 110 volt
night light bulb put out, and how many lumens would I expect to get from
the 8 watt fluorescent drop light. 
Thanks 
Barry Sends
