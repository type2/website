Hey,      
Don't automatically assume the trouble lies with the fuel injection.  If
the points are worn or are not adjusted properly you will get those
hiccups.  Also, a loose or bad spark plug wire can do it.  Bentley and
others say troubleshoot the ignition system thoroughly before assuming
trouble in the fuel injection.  A clogged fuel filter can also do this
to you.
