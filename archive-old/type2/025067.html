Subject: After the Rebuild---Update and new Q.
Message-ID: &lt;9bccb9b.24640e69_at_aol_dot_com&gt;

	First, many thanks for all the thoughtful replies---greatly 
appreciated.  Pulled the plugs and checked the compression and, whaddya know, 
not very good and uneven to boot, 105-120.  Shop immediately agreed that this 
was not acceptable, and will make it right, even if they have to tear it down 
again.  First, we'll make sure that there's no tight valves causing low 
readings, but I bet the thing will need to come out.
	They advised that if they do need to tear it down, I should scrape up 
the $ for new p &amp; c's.  Your responses were pretty evenly divided on the 
plusses and minuses of re-using my original ones.  The Bus Depot, for 
example, has what I'm assuming are Brazilian sets, and also gen-yew-wine 
German, for $170 more.  If I decide to replace them, is this a worthwhile 
expense?  My shop didn't really think so, and are happy with the ones they've 
been using (Mahle, I think.  Something about sleeves being Brazilian).  This 
is my forever bus, but I need to spend money wisely.  Opinions?

Thanks, Matt Q.
