&lt;&lt; 'm a little mystified how the aftermarket handles this problem - VW
 shows 7 different cams, the only difference being the gear size. &gt;&gt;

i often wondered this also.  about 2 yrs ago i built me a mild performance bug
motor for a baja.  i selected a mild grind cam,  and installed it knowing it
did not have the correct * + * or * - * that i needed.  well i developed a
strange oil leak so i decided to tear it open ( i suspected a leak in the oil
cooler area)  upon opening it up i discovered the cam gear teeth to we worn in
an odd and uneven pattern.  instead of the crank gear and the cam gear teeth
meeting evenly and flush with each other you could see on the face of each of
the cam gears teeth, where one part had been worn more.  the engine continued
to run fine  ( the oil leak was discovered on the flange that bolts the cooler
to the case.  jb weld and it is still running 30k + miles today )  cam
reinstalled.  so for what its worth...just a little story..................
