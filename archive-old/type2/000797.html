Somewhere linked from type2_dot_com is a copy of my original BA4 factory service
manual that a couple of list members scanned and put up on the web.  Not
sure of the exact link.  I think Darrell Boehler did it, maybe he can
provide a URL if you can't find it.  The BA4 and BA6 are virtually identical
in terms of ancilliary parts, etc.  The manual lists all neccessary parts
and where they are.  Some attach directly to the heater, others forward of
it in the ducting or under the dash (relays etc).  Make sure you get
everything, as new replacement parts are unavailable or incredibly
expensive.

&gt; installing BA6 heaters, I have a friend who is selling his '78 westy (got
&gt; banned for D.D!). He is going to give :) me the BA6 for his van!
&gt; How should I remove it? Any tips on bits not to leave behind? etc.
