&gt; Mine MUST be out of a type4 car because of the oil-bath air filter setup
&gt; right over the motor and the topside oil filler. Also, after a FULL service
&gt; job by me last weekend, I found a plug loose- but I cannot find a socket for
&gt; it: it is 2-connector, and bound in the section of the harness with the
&gt; 3-connector plug to the distributor.
&gt; 
&gt; So- does anybody know where I can get a hold of a type 4, non-AFC FI engine
&gt; guide?  Anything on-line?

The Type of fuel injection you have is Bosch D-Jetronic as opposed to
Bosch L-Jetronic which is what Buses from '75 on got.  D-Jet is a
precursor to L-Jet.  It was used on the VW Type 3 cars starting in '67 so
a Type 3 manual should be able to help you out.

I just spent some time getting a Volvo 164E with D-Jet running properly
again.  Many of the L-Jet troubleshooting tips still apply because the
system is largely the same as L-Jet.  

The key differences are that D-Jet uses a manifold pressure sensor to help
set the mixture as opposed to the air flow meter that L-Jet uses.  Also,
D-Jet uses a set of trigger points in the base of the distributor to tell
the ECU when to fire the injectors.  L-Jet instead uses a wire to the neg.
terminal on the coil for this purpose.

D-Jet fires the injectors in pairs unlike L-Jet which fires them all at
the same time.

D-Jet also uses a throttle switch which allows for extra injector firings
as the throttle is opened, acting like an accelerator pump on a carbed
engine.  

D-Jet will also have the standard sensors like L-Jet, such as an intake
air temperature sensor, a cylinder head temperature sensor, cold start
valve, thermo-time switch, etc.  

The key thing for D-Jet is that vacuum leaks will REALLY screw up the way
the engine runs.  Since the FI system works off manifold pressure as the
key factor in determining how much fuel is injected, any vacuum leaks will
screw up the manifold pressure, making the engine run rich which is
counterintuitive.  Taking care of the vacuum leaks will likely cure most
if not all of your problems.

If not, the other standard rules apply to troubleshooting:  compression
test and valve adjustment first.  Also do an ignition checkup/tuneup and
eliminate all vacuum leaks before proceeding.  You will likely fix the
problem without having to touch the FI.

After you have gone through all those basics then you can begin
troubleshooting the FI.  First look at fuel delivery and pressure, replace
fuel filter as a matter of course, put a fuel pressure gauge on it and
measure the pressure.  Should be 28 psi and is adjustable via a screw on
the pressure regulator (unlike L-Jet).

Another thing to look at is proper adjustment of the throttle switch and
cleanliness of the contacts within.  The Type 3 manual should help you
with the adjustment and you should be able to easily take apart the switch
and clean the contacts.

Make sure that the throttle plate has not been adjusted to adjust the
idle, this will result in screwy goings-on.  The throttle plate must fully
close when there is no pressure on the gas pedal so make sure visually
that it does and adjust the cable or the stop until it does.  

With the Volvo I found that the FI system was largely OK (with the
exception of the wires to the intake air temp sensor being disconnected
and a severely leaking cold start valve)
but it had lots of vacuum leaks which were causing most of the problems,
most notably the injector seals.  

Which reminds me that if it's running rich, be sure to check the cold
start valve and injectors for fuel leakage.  

Only after everything is in proper order can you play with idle and
mixture settings.  On the Volvo, the idle MIXTURE setting is a screw on
the control unit.  I would assume it's the same with the D-Jet in your
car.  The Volvo control unit is a monstrous box located under the front
passenger seat.  Yours is probably out back somewhere.  NEVER EVER adjust
the idle mixture screw unless you have sorted out everything else first
(such as leaking injectors, vacuum leaks, etc) AND you have access to an
exhaust CO meter.  

The idle SPEED adjustment is different.  On the Volvo it's a thumbscrew in
line with the aux. air regulator, don't know how VW did it w/ D-Jet but I
would bet it's similar.  

Hope this gets you started.  And remember Sean's wisdom:  Only a fool
dives into the FI before checking out the engine basics :-)
