Subject: Re: [T2] Headlight aimers??

Courtney,

Instruction are in Bentley for how to do it while aiming  at your 
garage door.  Works great.

Ya don't need no stinkin machine!  &lt;grin&gt;.
Compare after you are done with a newer car right next to it.(if you have 
a double garage door...

Cheers, dave

 Has anyone ever come across a cheaply priced headlight aimer like you used to see in the old days at any garage. They would suction cup it on to your headlight then adjust your headlight to the correct specs?? All the ones I see are 1000's of dollars!!

&gt; Thanks,
