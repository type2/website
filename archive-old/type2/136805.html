Subject: Re: [T2] Anonymous threatening letters left on my bus... 
  Advice?

Storage Unit = $65 a month for me in VA once upon a time (had to hide my ugly Beetle). 

Storage Unit Outside storage = even cheaper. 

Fenced, and includes security. DEFINITELY worth a though. 

I have those neighborhood committees. Never lived under one but had many friends who have and told us about living in places like it. Nice because they want to place to look nice, but sort of like living in communist Russia with the KGB telling you what you can and can't do. We're in the process of trying to buy a small house in a nicer neighborhood and we'll be faced with picky neighbors who own house 2 and 3 times more expensive than the one we're buying. Thankfully we've got a garage at this house (unlike now). 

Chris
