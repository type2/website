&gt;Here's an offbeat question, but I had to ask anyway. I have a Muir
&gt;Anniversary issue of some sort (can't remember the year, 25th I think.)
&gt;It's spiral bound so that it can lay flat. THe wierd thing though is that
&gt;it's arranged backwards. The front cover is where the back should be and
&gt;vise versa. The pages are also laid out in reverse order. Kind of novel but
&gt;hell when trying to tie things together from one page to the next. Anybody
&gt;else have one of these or have I stumbled on to a true &quot;collectable?&quot;

I've got one of those too ! I just flipped it over and everything is fine now... 8^).
