Why dont they attempt to put a round headlight on new design mockups of the
transporter?

One of the characteristics of the New Beetle that helped sell the idea of it
to me was that they continued on with the round head lights.

Even though the round head light style was common on more than just European
vehicles, I have permanantly associated the correlation of VW with round
head lights.

  Every VW type I have ever looked at in a magazine from childhood on had
the aesthetically pleasing round headlight.  Pictures of the old KDF,
Kubelwagen, Schwimwagen, Multitudes of type I's hoisted ashore the ports of
North America. Beautifully functional and economical type II's rolling by
deserts, forests and sea shores.  The round headlight was always there right
along with the trusty VW logo on the noses of our beloved buses.

  Then came the 80's...  More and more of the angular type head lights
started creeping into VW's vehicle design.  This wasn't bad, it was just
different than the time honored hallmarks of VW's past.

  So why can't some prototype design crew cough up a new mockup of a
bus/camper with the round head light style?  They figured that out with the
Beetle... I could give a rip if they changed anything else,.. though I feel
reasonably sure they will include a sliding door and head room.  I'm just
happy to see that anybody is toying with the concept of the transporter...
Maybe I should just step off my soap box and start saving my pennies for
when they finally do make a rebuild of the transporter and then try to sell
it to me for 60k +  .....
