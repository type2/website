&gt; I've just been quoted what seems an exceptional price for what I am
&gt; garanteed to be sodium filled 33mm exhaust valves for the 1.7 or 2.0 liter
&gt; van.  The price is $19 each which is unbelievable and may be a misquote at
&gt; cost so I'm about to jump on it and order 2 sets but I have some questions.
&gt; I am assured the valves are by a Porsche OEM but do not know the make.  As I
&gt; recall a recent disparity over on the Vanagon list between prices for
&gt; genuine German sodium filled and other makes (TRW?), is this a good price.
&gt; Are there any particular makes to be concerned about or avoided.  If in fact
&gt; when I order them tomorrow I find this to be the correct information and
&gt; price, I'll post the source to the list for anyone interested.

John:
The two oe manufacturers of VW valves were ATE (Arthur TEves)(aka
ah-tey-ay, auf Deutsch) and Eaton. I think TRW's are ATE's.
72 and early 73(pre sodium exhausts) would routinely break the heads off
their exhaust valves. The Eaton's would do so at around 60,000 miles,
the ATE's would last longer, to 100-110,000 miles. Usually such failure
occurred while on family vacation, and precipitated severe mechanical
trauma to the engine, always ruining 1 head, the piston, of course, and
sometimes if you were lucky, the crank and case. I am serious about the
vacation part, (it seemed to be long trips that precipitated it).
Virtually ALL 1700 bus motors (without sodium valves) experienced such
failure and I'm sure that fact alone cost VW tens of thousands of repeat
customers. Figure how many type 2's were imported into the US in 72 and
3/4 of 73 and you have an idea of what happened to the guys that
invented the mini-van (sorry, Lee)- sales plummeted.
I'm sure that's a lot cheaper than they have been, but there is probably
a greater supply than will ever be needed. They are only listed for
1700's actually, 2.0's didn't need them so bad because the FI allowed
the engine to run cooler and still reduced  its NOx. They will FIT 2.0's
however and couldn't hurt valve life.
