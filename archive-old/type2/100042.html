Subject: Mystery condenser

A long time I go I asked for some ID help with an ignition part in my engine
and no one could figure it out. I found out some more since...

This is the part:

http://homepage.mac_dot_com/ratwell/.Pictures/MoreParts4/102-211035257.jpg

It is line between the the coil and the condenser on the distributor.  I did
an ETKA part lookup on it a description came back: suppression condenser for
ignition coil. It's Bosch number is: 0 290 002 029.

So, could this be a suppressor for the radio interference that Canadian
vehicles were required to be equipped with?


The condenser it was attached to wasn't typical either and no one seemed to
be able to locate a description/usage for it or it's &quot;short&quot; part number:
1 237 330 271

I've since put a 02074 on the dizzy but I really don't know if it's
compatible with the black box. That condenser was universal from 1974-1978
but that doesn9t mean much.

IIRC two capacitors in series results in a lower valve smaller than either
value alone.  I would guess that the capacitance of the 02074 could be the
same value and the weird condenser inline with the black box but not knowing
what's inside the box I don't know what the effect of bypassing the box with
a 02074 would be.

Anyone know what the black box does?
