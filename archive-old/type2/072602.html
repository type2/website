Subject: Throttle plate screws

I'm sending the throttle plate assembly from my Kadrons to be rebushed.  I
wanted to disassemble it myself to see if I could plug the shaft bore with,
well,   anything.  The two screws that hold the throttle plate to the shaft
are unusual.  They have a slot in the head but the underside is peened over
like a rivet.

My questions:
1. Are there threads on the screw?
2.  If I grind the underside away, will I be able to find replacements for
those screws?

Thanks, Jack
