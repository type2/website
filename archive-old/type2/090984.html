Subject: Air Cooled Engine Seals

I was looking at my engine bay this weekend and saw 
noticeable gaps between the engine tin and the engine wall. 
The seal has kind of pulled away from the side. For some 
reason the distance on the passenger side seems greater than 
the drivers side too. My questions are:

1) There is a small gap between the block and the fan 
housing, is this normal? 

2) How the heck do you replace the seal around the engine?

3) Do you use a sealant to make sure it stays in place, or to 
seal things that pass through the tin?

4) I have one small hole (looks like its from an absent 
screw) how should I plug it up?

Thanks,
Chris
