&gt;&gt; This happened all of a sudden? You may want to check the vacuum hoses
&gt;&gt; going to the distributor. The slightly larger one provides vacuum for the
&gt;&gt; retard mechanism and only really kicks in at idle. 
&gt;
&gt;You got me confussed hear. My books say the 75 has only one vacuum hose

Trust me on this one, Douglas. 

&gt;&gt; about 7.5 BTDC (note that Muir's table says 0 deg., but that's wrong).
&gt;
&gt;Static timing would be LESS than Dynamic because of the centrifical
&gt;advance built into the dist. Why would you advance it MUCH more than you
&gt;need. I can't find any comment from John accept to take it to VW, have
&gt;them time it dynamic and then check it static to find the correct static
&gt;point of timing. IMHO your advise is not well given; too much timing
&gt;will burnup your engine!!!!!

The vacuum retard kicks in at idle only and retards timing by about 12
degrees. Therefore, when you disconnect it, timing jumps from 5 ATDC to
about 7 deg BTDC. Now, total *centrifugal* advance is about 23 degrees
(+/- 2 deg.);  so with static timing set at about 7 deg BTDC, you still
only get a total of 30 degrees advance (remember also, at that high rpm,
there's essentially neither vacuum advance nor retard).

&gt;Have you set your timing at 7.5 btdc static and then checked it dynamic?
&gt;I'd love to see your results!!!

I have and it is as I said: 7.5 BTDC static corresponds to 5 ATDC at idle. 
The figures apply to the stock distributor on the '75 1800 fuel injected
bus; they may not apply to other distributors. I grant, however, that it
is very important to double-check whether *total* advance really is about
30 degrees. If not, I suppose something might be wrong with the
distributor.
