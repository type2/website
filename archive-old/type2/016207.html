I use a turkey baster (spelling?) to put oil in the sparkplug hole.  You can
buy a cheap one at Wal-Mart for 97 cents.  My usual rule is to never touch
or do anything to the spark plugs when the engine is at operating temp, but
this little rule has to be bent when checking compression. You must remove
the plugs while the engine is at operating temp, but do NOT reinstall the
plugs until the engine is cold again.  This works for me.  Good luck.

OK, you are suppose to check the compression when the engine is (hot - 
warmish).

You are NOT suppose to remove the spark plugs when the engine is (hot - 
warmish).

Heck, I am STILL trying to get two teaspoons of oil into #3!!  How do you do

this without spilling some all over the place.  I can use a squirt (oil) can

with a flexible neck, but how do I know I got the 2 teaspoons in, or did I 
squirt oil all over the place??

Man, these things really bother me - like, half way through my lunch hour.
