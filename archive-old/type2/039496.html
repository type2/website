Subject: Motor rebuilders

    I know I should look in the archives, but they are not working for me. 
Maybe some people on the list could help me. I need a new 1600dp for my 
truck. I was sitting there today with the money for a new mexican long block 
that I was going to buy from Scat. These motor cost $1500. I know I should 
build it my self. In the past I have built my own engines. I can't do that 
at this time because of life situation....  So here I am with the money to 
buy a new/rebuilt motor. What I would like from the list is their opinions 
on weather or not the &quot;new&quot; is worth the money or should I buy from a 
rebuilder such as Boston engines etc. I know no GTX. I would like to hear 
any past experiences with mail order rebuilders that people have had. A 
Boston engines 1600 is $950, a 550 dollar difference from buying a &quot;new&quot; 
motor. Is the new motor worth the money. I am looking into local rebuilders 
but I have a hard time trusting anybody without a reference. lano
