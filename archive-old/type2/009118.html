&gt;OK, so the price point is that a vehicle that
&gt;can move under its own power forward and reverse
&gt;is worth rock bottom $500.
&gt;
&gt;Uh, is there a bus anywhere that actually runs
&gt;and yet is not worth $500 in parts?  
&gt;

Right now scrap metal is just about worthless. Wrecking yards are only paying $10-$20 !!!! for a complete car. Economically that $500 is a prettier picture then one $20 bill. Sure, a bus has at least $500 in parts, but to get it you would have to part it yourself.
