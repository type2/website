Subject: re:advice please

Thank you all very much for the help so far. I'm sure I will call upon you 
again soon. I think I'm going to try to repair the leaks myself. I'll be on 
the lookout for a &quot;plan B&quot; engine, and will probably do the  work over a 
long weekend, but yeah - I'll give it a go. I can plod along okay until the 
parts arrive.

I'll scrap the Lucas' oil stabilizer for now - I have never heard of it 
before yesterday... never had a need for oil stabilizer (that i knew of).

Yikes, it's been ten years since I've rebuilt an engine..(a Nissan Pulsar, 
and then a 'new' Saturn in High School)... and I don't have my uncle Ronny's 
garage (&amp; tools) to help out, now. Bentley and I are going to become best 
friends.

What can I realistically expect for an engine lifetime, anyway - in this 
climate, with a 9 mile commute? How long does this engine usually &quot;last&quot;? 
Theoretically, as long as the head isn't cracked it can still go, right?

- Looking forward to Jerome!

Stef
