The correct answer is that I had the #2 and #4 wires reversed on the
distributor (connected them in 1-2-3-4 order instead of 1-4-3-2 order).
This caused the spark for those 2 cylinders to occur during the exhaust
stroke of the piston instead of the compression stroke while #1 and #3
were working perfectly.  Here's the listees that responded with the
exact cause:
     Kyle
     David Schwarze
     Tony Mourkas
     cjj_at_net1inc_dot_net (sorry, no name available)
     Gary Gibson
     Dave Greenland
     Jeff Scarbrough
     Paul Doubek
     Dave Jersey
     Craig Sauls
     Rick Fluck
     Bill Keating
     Chad Frost
     George Lyle
     Jeff Carver
     Eric &amp; Barb
     Harry Klimek
     Gordon Couger
     Erik
     Mike Benthin
     Al Brase
     Erik Meltzer

Runner-up prizes go to these folks because they were on the right track,
but weren't as specific to the answer as the '1st place' folks were.
They all thought it was distributor related and suggested the old
'distributor off by 180 degrees' trick as the culprit.
     Edmund A. Hintz   
     Jeff Stewart 
     Jim Becker
     Andy Pechenik

Here are some of the other suggested causes - many of which I, too,
thought of and tested for:
     Carburetor synchronization problems.
     &quot;Weber chipmunks are too small.&quot;
     Inconsistent compression ratios among cylinders.
     Intermittently bad spark plugs.
     Bad cam lobe for the intake on #2, #4.
     Cam gear not properly aligned with the crank gear.
     Bent pushrods.
     Intake manifold leaks.
     Intake manifold not lined up with ports in head.
     Forgot to connect the balance tube between the carbs.
     Forget to remove the rags stuffed in the #2 and #4 intake 
          ports while the carbs where off.
     TOO MANY BEERS while installing engine/carbs (too true).

A few respondents had the right idea, but hadn't deciphered my story
properly and/or didn't realize the significance of the non-firing
cylinders being the 2 opposed ones (#2 and #4).  This may have been my
fault for not being more clear.  If so, my apologies.

I spent 2 hours testing different things (mostly gaining the data that I
stated in the original problem) and had spent way too much time trying
to figure out how a single barrel carb on a y-shaped manifold could be
supplying fuel to one barrel and not the other.  

I finally puzzled it out in my head as I was drifting off to sleep
around midnight at which point (and much to my wife's annoyance) I lept
out of bed and ran outside in my skivvies to confirm my mistake.  I'm
much impressed that so many list members came up with the exact
solution.

Hope you all enjoyed this session of 'Stump the Mechanic' - I know I
did!  Anyone else got any puzzles they'd like to pose?  If I come up
with any more good ones, I'll let you all know.

58 single cab - Zorm (with the firing order of 1-2-3-4?)

P.S.  Zorm runs much stronger on 4 cylinders than he did on 2!
