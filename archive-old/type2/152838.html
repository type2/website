Subject: Re: [T2] New concept van in Michelin Challenge with bus feel

IIRC - It was 30mpg, cruises at 50 and under 1000 marks :)
I used to have a little spiel....yea...so anyways :)

I must say - I do agree with the note on the verdeir design with the
passenger seat that turns into the staircase totally awesome and i really
really liked how both doors open and there is an awning an basically 2 hang
out spots and one with a kitchen :) Hmm....this is one of the reasons why i
want to buy my friends 58 double door walk through...with a roof rack and 2
awnings, and a removable kitchen on the passenger side....yea OK I think I
am dreaming a little to much for my budget right now...by the time I would
be done with the 58 i probably would have almost 10k into it but thats a
fraction of the possible new ones, and i would be a lot cooler....

&gt; What ever happened to the original VW concept of keeping it simple and
&gt; targeting it to the common man/woman.  I think VW has forgotten that
&gt; Volkswagen means peoples-automobile.  I mean, after all, Hitler himself
&gt; in 1933 directed Porshe to create a small, four-seater, with durable
&gt; engine, at least 40 miles to the gallon, air-cooled, with a low price
&gt; (then below 1,000 marks).
&gt;
&gt; Now we all know Hitler was a bit of a nut but it was still a good
&gt; concept.  Here we are 70+ years later and the average car still doesn't
&gt; get that good of gas mileage and VW is pricing the vehicle out of the
&gt; common person's reach with engineering that is more and more complex
&gt; and, therefore, more and more difficult for the average person to work
&gt; on....
