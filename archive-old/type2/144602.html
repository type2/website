&gt; I would like to lightly disassemble them (points,
&gt; vacuum can,etc.) and stick them in an ultra-sonic
&gt; cleaner, followed by an alcohol bath to remove the
&gt; water, and then treat with a spray of lubricant.
&gt; Is there anything inside the dizzy that will be
&gt; hurt by this process?

Off the top of my head: the felt wick in the center of
the rotor shaft might not like getting soaked in the
cleaner, or it might be hard to get dry again.  I *think*
it's just pressed into the hole and you can get it out
with maybe a pair of needle-nose pliers.

I've had the stock vacuum+mechanical advance on a '74 Bug
distributor apart a few years ago and I kind of remember
that it used plastic (nylon?) bushings around the pivot
points for the flyweights.  Clearly these can stand up to
some heat and oil, but I don't know what else they can
take, or even if all distributors have them.

I haven't had a distributor far apart enough to know, but
are there any oil-impregnated bushings (Oilite or equal)
for the shaft?  Bentley or the parts manual should say.
You just might &quot;clean&quot; the oil out of these with the
ultrasonic bath.

I wouldn't put any of the electrical stuff or the vacuum
can in the cleaner.  If the vacuum can is really funky
you might clean the outside with a wire brush or sandpaper
and maybe some solvent, but don't let the solvent get on
to the rubber diaphragm.
