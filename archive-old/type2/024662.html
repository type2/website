Subject: Re: [T2] AFM Diagnostics was: type2 Digest

&gt;If you find a mechanic willing to charge you to open the AFM and try to
&gt;tweek it, find another mechanic. This fellow is unknowledgable. Bentley
&gt;gives full procedures for validating the AFM. If it is putting out bad
&gt;data, replace it. If it responds correctly to test procedures, it's not
&gt;your problem. If your mechanic will not first follow given procedures to
&gt;insure results, find one who will. Sounds like he did determine from
&gt;inspection a problem with the AFM.

That all isn't exactly true.  The L-jet AFMs have a long standing
reputation for the spring weakening over time and requiring
adjustment, and they are in fact quite adjustable.  The Bentley
resistance checks are mostly useless folks, many a bad AFM will
pass those checks with flying colors because the checks don't test
anything in a quantitative way regarding AFM resistance to airflow,
only the end points and grossly that the brushes change something
and that the temp sensor if present is somewhere near in spec.
This is exactly like my points on the head temp sensor the data given
in Bentleys will only tell you if there is a terribly gross error.  With a
$20 head temp sensor it is one thing to say just replace it, with a
$150 AFM it's a different circumstance altogether for me at least, worth
my own time.  Now in the day there were a lot of people in CA that
could tweak the 914 1.8 and Bus L-jet AFMs back into spec.  The
ones that did it sensibly and correctly of course used a dyno and
emissions tester.

Now Tim may be correct in assuming that the mechanic in question is
not likely to be such a person, but then again he might in fact be, sort
of hard to tell.  Ask him what he intends to do and how.  If he can put
it on a dyno or road test it while monitoring emissions under load and
the price seems right (no more than and hour or two labor till you get
diminishing returns) then you might let him have at it.  But then again
I can pop the top off one and dial it a few clicks for better running often
enough myself and it is easy enough to inspect the resistance tracks
and if worn plastically deform the brushes to contact a new path and
thereby get another 50-75k out of a &quot;shot&quot; AFM.

But these aren't things for the faint of heart, or those scared that they
might let free some nasty little electrons.  If you doubt the guy knows
what he is doing, move along.  Indeed most &quot;mechanics&quot; ignorantly just
keep replacing parts on Bosch FI systems until they get somehting that
fixes the problem.  This is the primary reason for the L-jets bad rep.
Tim is right, I've never, EVER, come across a bad bus L-jet ECU in the
last 20 I've touched, a number of which known to be &quot;bad.&quot;  I've had one
bad bug ECU and well digifant ECU's that is another matter altogether...

My take home point is that it is ignorant to assume someone is
ignorant until you have enough information to make an informed
opinion, I know a 40+ year VW trained mechanic who can pop
open any L-jet, digijet, or digifant AFM and tune the car by ear
and driving to often within spec before he gets around to hooking
up the emissions tester.  He is one in a thousand, god knows if
I screw with one too far I'm lucky to get it back even to a stumbling
runnable condition.  Unfortunately you do have to take into account
that you are burning labor $ every minute someone screws around
so if they don't know what they are doing its your bill.
