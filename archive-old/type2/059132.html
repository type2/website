Subject: back on the road again

i figure its about time i wrote the list.  my names joe.  im a student at
the university of illinois at urbana champaign.  i was previously on the
list under ebart_at_softfarm_dot_com.  but now im back at school and under this
email account.

i still have my three buses, 69 westy, 74 westy, and a 68 microbus.  

went to my first vw event in two years today, the CILVA meet in
normal, il.  small but fun.  weather sucked.  cold and overcast.  went
with Lara (possible love interest, she has a 73 bug convertible, YES!!) so
i had company.  i miss my vws here at school, luckily we have room for
them back home under cover.  mom doesnt approve of me driving them more
than about 20 miles from home.  and ive found its easier to agree with mom
than argue, so i drive a ch*vy truck.  

but since there was only two vendors at the show, one being mofoco, and
another being a guy with a small truck, i was wondering where i could find
a dual vacuum advance distributor.  can be used, just has to work.  part
numbers can be VW 113 905 205 AN or VW 113 905 205 AJ.  mine sucks.
broken or something.  dont like to use 009, makes car hard to tune and it
usually runs like crap with it.  so any leads will be appreciated.  

thanks for listening to the ramblings

joe
