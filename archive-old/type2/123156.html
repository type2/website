Subject: Re: [T2] WHAT is the &quot;hubcap&quot;?

more on the hubcap, it has been up and down the east coast of the USA and
Canada and is working it's way west,  it is trying to ttravel the entire
distance in VW buses.

some &quot;passes&quot; of the hubcap were quite elaborate,  for example I passed it
off in the middle of the potomac river while on the Jubel Early cable
ferry.   others have been just as or more elaborate, photos have been
posted although the hubcap website is down at the moment.  hubcap is
somewhere in the Western USA headed for the West Coast, then south thru at
least Mexico before crossing to New Zealand, Aust, South Africa, other
countries in Africa, middle east then West to England scandavavia and back
to Germany where it was to be presented to the VW museum 

so the plans went...
