&gt; Is this the parts-book that only shows parts and no text or partnumbers?

The book is Titled &quot;Parts List Type2/1968.&quot; It consisted of diagrams and
part numbers. The book also contains info pertaining to interior and
exterior paint codes and trim colors as well as laquor info for the paints.
It is approximately 300 pages front and back. The version I have contains
supplemented infromation &quot;4&quot; through the 1972 model year: parts listings for
dual carb 1700 (what we refer to as pancakes or Type 4 motors.)
 
&gt; I remember reading a link to a scanned T2 manual as well this weekend. I
&gt; guess I must have accidentally deleted the message which came from the
&gt; Type2-list. The subject of this message had to do with a pipe that
&gt; connects to the heater box. Can anyone FWD this URL to me?

I thumbed through my mail and can't seem to find that but I would like it as
well.
