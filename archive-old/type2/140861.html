Subject: RE: [T2] Are all clutches the same?

&gt; Can't speak for throwout bearings Tamarah, but most VW
&gt; suppliers give Sachs clutches. If it is from a FLAPS
&gt; provider, it is most likely a remanufactured Sachs, which may
&gt; vary in quality.


There are many brands on the market, ranging from original quality to cheap
Chinese knockoffs. You will need to ask the retailer whose kit they are
supplying. Only Sachs and LuK are OEM suppliers, and neither of them sell
remanufactured kits. If it is remanufactured, the unit itself may have Sachs
markings, but only because this is who made the original &quot;core.&quot; The actual
reman job was probably not done by Sachs and the quality may indeed vary.
If it is new, look for the Sachs, LuK, or VW logos. If none are present it
may be aftermarket (Chinese, etc.).
