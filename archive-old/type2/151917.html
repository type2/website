I had a tent with my 65 Westy, set it up maybe twice a real PITA.

&gt;   Does anybody here really like their tents? Responses on The Samba
&gt;   appear to be about 50/50.

what I do ever since is I have a blue tarp and throw it over the van,
bungee cord it to the wheelwells on the drivers side and pull it out over
two tent poles on the sliding door side, up in 3 minutes, down in 2, less
if I'm in a hurry
