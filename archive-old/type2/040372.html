Subject: Re: Help on touch up painting

Remember when using spray cans for touch-up to do the following:
Instead of taping newsprint flush to the area immediately outside of 
your painting area,
tape the paper on &quot;backwards&quot; (so to speak) and fold it back over onto 
itself so as to eliminate a sharp &quot;stop&quot; edge from your spraying work 
area.
In other words, fold the paper back over itself so as to create a 
&quot;feathered&quot; stopping to the paint  applied area, as opposed to an 
immediate stop of the application.

Did I manage to say that as badly as possible????
