&gt; Does anyone know of a place that currently stocks the thermostat for
&gt; an1800 engine?
&gt; Bus Depot is out of them.


Discontinued by the manufacturer. You're highly unlikely to find them
anywhere other than perhaps the dealer. However, a Type 1 engine thermostat
can be rather easily modified to work.
