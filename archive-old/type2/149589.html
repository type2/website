Subject: Re: [T2] air tools

&gt;&gt;Change the oil in the compressor often using non detergent 30 weight oil

I changed the oil before I fired it up.  I used stuff from Lowe's called 
&quot;Synthetic Air Compressor Oil&quot;.  Was that a bad thing?  Can I go back to 
regular oil?  Should I swtch to straight 30 weight?

Thanks all!  Getting allot of info here.  I read something online that said 
all air tools except for paint guns, tire air chucks, and blow guns should 
use 90 PSI.  To little or too much can cause excess wear.  Any truth to that 
at all?

     I didn't just inherit the tools.  I bought them a while ago after 
buying a wimpy used compressor.  I bought the new compressor, and let's just 
say that prior to having it, too much air pressure was _not_ a concern with 
my last compressor :-)  Of course, I immediately lost the manuals for all of 
them just after flipping through them and looking at the pictures.
