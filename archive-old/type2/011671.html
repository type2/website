X-Diagnostic: MESSAGE REQUIRES APPROVAL

Volks,
   An informal gathering of bus Volks will take place in
a central (kinda) location in the Seattle / Tacoma Wa.
area.
   Meeting in the area of the museum of flight. (just off
I-5) we will carabus to Bry's VW/Audi reclamation yard for
a parts picking party and then off on a short drive to Alki
beach area to grab something at one of the many eating
establishments on the waterfront there or bring your own
food. We are hoping for some Indian summerlike weather!
e-mail me direct if you might attend so I can let you know
of any developments between now an then.
  As of today we have approx. 6 busers from the Wet Westy
list who would like to attend. Any members of the Cascade
Kombi club interested? Dont belong, or know of, either of
these groups? Might be a good time to meet some Type 2
volks
in the area then!

                 Later, Dan
