Subject: Re: [T2] bus idles high when warm

Yeah, it is the MS.

Solid lifters and only one valve has needed adjustment within the 
engine's first 1000 miles.  The others are rock solid.  Cold-start disabled.

The idle seems to be somewhere around 1500.

I guess there could be a vacuum leak somewhere after the throttle plate, 
but I'd think that'd affect the rpms at both cold and hot temps.

It's not the decel valve because I can pull the hose that goes between 
the S-tube and the valve with no change in rpm.

I'm really wondering if the injectors are the culprit here.  I'll see if 
I can get my other set of injectors cleaned...

&gt; Mike,
&gt; 
&gt; Is this the one with megasquirt on it?
&gt; 
&gt; Check your megasquirt datalogs?  Solid lifters if I remember correctly?
&gt; Last adjustment on the solids?
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; How high is high idle?
&gt; 
&gt; If this is the one with megasquirt on it, you should only have to worry
&gt; about intake leaks *after* the throttle body and no place else.
&gt; 
&gt; Maybe one of your injectors really likes to be hot before it works good?
&gt; Cold start injector disconnected?
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Cheers, dave
