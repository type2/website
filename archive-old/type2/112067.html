&gt; Second, a 13.5 liter propane fired water heater, the 'Malaga'. Pricing will

&gt; water heater.

Which leads to the interesting idea of a &quot;hydronic&quot; heating system like
that used in some boats.  Run the water through tubes located under a
false wood floor and heat the entire floor.  Use a thermostat to control
the heat.  You could have a nice warm bus 24/7 with such a
setup!
