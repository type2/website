&gt; I have posted the artwork I drew in 2003 here:

&gt; I scanned an early-bay speedometer and used the same numbers. If you  
&gt; want a late-bay clock you'll need to change the gray background to  
&gt; black.
&gt; 
&gt; To &quot;un-dish&quot; the original spacer plate I simply placed it between two  
&gt; chunks of 2x4 and hit them with a hammer. After that the plate is  
&gt; flat enough to work just fine.

Thanks Greg,
That's exactly what I was looking for.
I will print it on mat finish photo paper using a HP photo printer and will 
use a clock movement with a long reach spindle so it won't need to be dished.
Not sure what glue I will use yet.
Regarding clocks on ebay $40 is not in my budget for such a luxury item which 
is why I am attempting the DIY solution which should be practically $0 in 
cost since the movements are rather inexpensive.
Thanks for all the responces and ideas.
Rusty
