Ronnie,
Since you talked to them, I am wondering.........
If I have  a failed unit of theirs that suffered infant mortality,
are they interested in taking the faulty one back and giving me a new one 
of the proper construction?

I'd be willing to try one of their &quot;new&quot; ones on a replacement basis and 
report back what I find.
As is, I have one that failed almost immediately, and want no more of that, 
of course.
