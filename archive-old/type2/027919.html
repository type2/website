I bought a German OEM type muffler for the '67 about 5 months ago. I live in 
Southern California where there's no road salt or snow danger, just a bit of 
rain now and then, but within one month of use, the grey paint on my 
muffler, damper pipe and tailpipe has burnt off, and rust is starting to 
form on these parts, not to mention it looks like a big booger at the back 
of my bus.

I was figuring I'd get some high heat spraypaint at the FLAPS and recoat 
them. Has anyone done this with success?

I'm about to do a resto on another bus and buy another muffler, should I 
strip this paint off before &quot;high-heat&quot; painting them?
Any other alternatives?

&gt; &gt; Old busses are swell, but the mufflers only last a few years. Then, they
&gt;rust.
