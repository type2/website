Subject: westy electric sink pump

Guten Tag, meine Freunde,

Pardon my ignorance, but I need to know how the
electric water pump for the sink on my stock '74 Westy
works. Does it run off the 12v system? Or does it run
off external 110v ac?

The reason I ask is (and I'm not at home to test it
right now) because I just ASSUMED that it ran off the
internal 12v electrics in the bus. But I cannot get it
to work. Before I start tearing into the switch and/or
the motor, I'd really like to know which juice it runs
off of. 

Thanks in advance!
