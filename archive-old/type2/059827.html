Subject: timing/tuning

Hello everybody,

I'm new to the list and have lots of questions, but I'll try to stay
focused. I bought my 74 Bus (my second VW, the first being an oval window
Beetle in the early 70's) on Labor Day, and I love it. It came with a Bosch
009 and the stock Solex carbs. I wasn't able to get it dialed in, so I
replaced the 009 with a Bosch 050 with positive results. Having the
ignition system in order, I moved to the carbs. Using the Bentley manual, a
uni-syn, and a tach, and following the steps in order (several times) I
determined that the carbs were worn out. I bought and installed a set of
Weber 34ICT's last week-end. It's a different Bus! It seems to be doing
everything it should, but I'd love some input from others with this set-up.
Where do you set the timing? Any hot tips for fine-tuning the carbs?

Thanks in advance, 
Ray Carter (it's not a car, its a Bus)
