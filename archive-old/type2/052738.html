Subject: [T2] No reverse...

Well, The Terrapin Flyer is now moving under her own power for the first time in about 7 years. BUT, she only wants to go forward. All the other gears are there, but reverse is a no go. Where do I start? It sure is a pain having to drive through the yard and then roll back down the driveway to back her in....
