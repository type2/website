Jamie, do you really get 20's?  I am happy with 15-17!  I think that the
VW spec on timing is so retarded (to keep the heat down) that we never
really get out of the &quot;late timing&quot; range by water cooled standards.

And I do find that when I get a vac reading below 15, it is time to go
searching for a vac leak.  Usually just jiggling things will make enough
of a difference in the gauge reading that I can find it.
