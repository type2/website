Subject: Oil Cooler question

On the Type 4 2.0L engine, there are two holes on the oil cooler housing =
where the oil cooler is attached to the engine.  Can someone tell me how =
the oil is routed?  Is the top hole for oil OUT or IN?  I am trying to =
set up and remote oil cooler and need to know how the oil flows through =
those two ports.

TIA,
Jack Lockamy
