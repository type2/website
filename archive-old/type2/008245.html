&gt;I've got a new problem with my '69 Westy and it's driving me nuts!
&gt;
&gt;When I go to start the bus, it will turn over and begin to run until I
&gt;let go of the key, then it dies. If I hold the key in a slightly
&gt;forward-rotated position (not so far that the starter turns), it will
&gt;run and THEN I can let go of the key. It seems to have a &quot;sweet spot&quot;.
&gt;
&gt;I'm pretty sure it's the switch itself and not electrical as the
&gt;problem goes away when I hold the key in the aforementioned
&gt;&quot;sweet-spot&quot;.
&gt;
&gt;Any ideas? Anyone have a good switch (gotta have the VW key, too!!!)
&gt;for sale?

I also had a problem with my ignition switch last week and my bus
nearly went up in flames !!!!

I have been moving apartments and was putting some stuff in storage.
My brother-in-law Pete was helping and as a reward I let him drive my
bus :-)
When he turned the key to start, it would not move! Never happened before!
So after a bit of fiddling and some WD-40 and leverage with a pliers,
the key would turn and start but not return to &quot;on&quot; position automatic,
you had to move it back manually to stop the starter!

The worked for about a day, then when I was making another trip to the
storage, with 1/2 my worldly goods in the back, turned the key on and
clouds of smoke started to appear from the dash :-(0)
Turned the key off, ran to the back and ripped off the battery cable!
Smoke cleared, and my heart started again! 
Took off inst. cluster and saw that the batt. wire from the headlight
switch to ignition switch had completely melted!! So with help
from my Brother-in-law Pete, we went to local Flaps, got some wire,
terminals and a generic ignition switch, which is now cabled ties to
the steering column! 

My manuals are in storage at the moment, so how do I replace the original
switch? are they available? and for how much?
