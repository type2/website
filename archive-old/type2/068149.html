Subject: Purchase advice/parts availability (59 Camper)

A '59 camper here in town is for sale. Briefly, I was looking for 
purchase advice.  I have yet to look at it, however, as described, 
it is in &quot;good shape&quot;, &quot;needs an engine&quot;.

First of all, the lack of an engine doesn't concern
me, because the price is right.  However, what should 
I be looking for besides the obvious (body shape, rust,
interior, visual appearance).  

Anything I should look for/look out for the first time over? 
For instance, how does one check for structural integrity, or the 
condition of the brakes, or the shape of the suspension,
or the transmission etc..? Common sense? 

Speaking hypothetically, if this bus only really needed
an engine, and minor TLC, would an open-minded, mechanically-inclined
youth (20) such as myself be able to get this up an running?
Or should I ofer this up to a list member with capability:)?

Time is no an issue, as winter is almost upon us here (WI), and
I have a heated garage to work in.  Based on advice, I will 
inspect the bus, and report back, and if it doesn't seem within
my grasp, I'll happily pass on the information to anyone interested.

Thanks in advance,
Chris Binder
