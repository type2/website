Remember that your cooling system is bolted to the end of your crankshaft.
The greater the RPM's the greater the cooling. It runs cooler on hills for
two reasons:  First, as you go downhill, you let up on the gas, but keep
the clutch in so the RPM's stay up, pumping more air over an engine that
is burning less gas (and generating less heat as a result).  Second, you
*may* be downshifting on the uphills raising the RPM's and pumping more
air even though, with the pedal to the metal, you are generating more
heat.  On level ground you may be doing 50-55 in 4th with the pedal down
and the RPM's down too.

Last year I spent 8000 miles on the road driving from here (DC) to Seattle
to LA and back with a pair of VW virgins.  I spent the first 3000 miles
(to Seattle) banging on their heads every time they tried to mountain
climb in 4th at 50 mph.  After that, I took over the driving 'til we got
back to the &quot;flat states&quot; (NM, TX.....).

VW's *need* high RPM's to pump cooling air.  They run coolest at the top
of the RPM range.  Downshifting a Ford is a good idea in the mountains.
Downshifting a VW is *vital* in the mountains.  If your RPM's are too low
even on flat ground (45-55 mph in 4th around town) your engine *will* heat
up.  The solution is (for 'loafers) to hold second 'til 27-30, third 'til
45-47 and try not to do either ~30 or ~50 in any gear range for extended
periods.  Splits (different gearing) may vary (and I am learning {slowly}
to keep my mouth shut during &quot;split&quot; post sessions ;-)

My mountain driving drill is to start at ~65-70.  As you start climbing,
if the speed starts to drop, back off to 3/4 throttle and let it.  When
the speed drops to ~55-57,  clutch pedal goes in and shift to third.  As
it drops past 47, out comes the clutch and try 3rd.  Do the same if you
drop to 35 (only once on that trip).
