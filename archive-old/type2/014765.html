Sorry if this missleads anyone, I realy do not suggest putting this fuel
line on a FI Bus, it would not work as John said, But some aftermarket carbs
use the 1/4in or 5/16in fuel line and it will be great for those. With a
200psi working pressure, it will handle any carborated fuel system out
there. He is right, the Bus FI system must use the Metric size. Sorry if I
misled anyone.

I do not know if 1/4in is close enough to 5mm to work correctly or
&gt;not, but the price was right.

That price was WRONG.  It will eat your bus someday.  I used it, with
tightly clamped SS band clamps, and it still wiggled loose.  Don't do it.
Get the right stuff.  It's seductively close, but it DOES NOT FIT CORRECTLY.

Sorry to preach, but the right stuff is out there.  Tell 'em, Ron.
