Subject: Gas Pedal appears bent or off track

in my 74 Westy, I just noticed today that the gas pedal appears not right.
 It appears that it is just connected at the bottom right and the bottom
left appears just loose.  As a consequence, the gas pedal leans to the
left, almost underneath the brake pedal.

Is there some sort of bracket that holds the gas pedal at the bottom?  How
do I go about hooking it back up and returning it to normal?

Thanks for any and all help.
