Subject: cleaning heat risers

archive is down or something funny is happening. anyway how is everybody
cleaning out their heat risers. i am putting a rebuild in the kreeper
and my risers are completely blocked. also is anybody doing anything
nifty to get their fuel line through the front tin over the
tranny-somebody suggested a metal pipe through the grommet. wasnt sure
if that was necessary or not. the place that did my rebuild is saying
only to torque lower head bolts after 300 miles. i know the archives
address this but still wondering what certain people are saying...
doctor tim?
