First of all, thanks to those who responded to my passenger door lock
question. I poked in there quickly last night, and it looks like there's a
nut on the tumbler that needs tightening. I'll get to that tonight. If for
nothing else, reading from those knowledgeable about things gives me the
extra oomph I often need to start tearing Itch apart in order to fix him
myself. Thanks.

Now, the Bus Names list has grown considerably this week, mainly due to my
perusing the WETWESTIES website. I have a favor to ask.

At the beginning of each alphabetic letter, I have a thumbnail of a bus
whose name starts with that letter. Each letter, that is, except K, Q, V,
and XYZ. If anyone has pics of any of those busses, can you pmail them to me
so I can complete the thumbnails?

Oh yeah. Somebody name their next bus Q-sumpthin-or-nuther. And pmail me a
pic.

Thanks -
