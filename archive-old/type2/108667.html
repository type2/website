&gt; So, I know that you &quot;get&quot; this part. You must make money or you won't have
a
&gt; business for long.

Whoa, Man.  That's so revolutionary, so cool, like, did you set up a pot
shop or what, did you, like, find this in the smoke?

&gt; ... you don't have to make a buck every time you take time for someone...

[Apparently doesn't have kids... (grin)]

&gt; The profit motive is 100% legitimate and anything to suggest that it isn't
is potentially dangerous counter-culture...

No kidding?  But personally, I don't have to have a &quot;what's-in-it-for-me?&quot;
attitude to support my profit motives.  Not even &quot;enlightened self
interest&quot;.

How do I know this?

Because of my darling wife, Karen Ann.  Karen and I were married in `77.  In
`82, Karen developed seizures and other strange neurological symptoms that
took 6 years to diagnose as a rare mitochondrial disorder.

The symptoms were sort of a combination of Alzheimer's and muscular
dystrophy.  Over the course of 10 years, Karen went from the lovely,
incredibly fun to be married to woman of my dreams, to a pale shadow of
herself.  In the last few years of her life, she didn't know either me or my
son.  Karen died in `92, 13 days before our 15th wedding anniversary.

Over the course of those 10 years, I learned what it meant to sacrifice
one's life in service to another, without any return, no profit, real or
from &quot;enlightened self interest&quot;.  Anyone can view a small glimpse into this
time by reading Karen's medical history, available in PDF format at our
website at www.melas_dot_org.

It was beyond hell, plain and simple.  Some folk suggested that I divorce
Karen in order to avoid the burden of the financial strain (eventually
$2,000,000.00+), and others abandoned us when we needed their moral support
the most.  I learned a new definition for the word &quot;alone&quot;, especially after
Karen died.

When I hear anything akin to &quot;no one ever does anything without serving
themselves&quot;, I naturally suspect that some folk have never been in a
situation where they had to choose to do it.

I did what I did because I loved Karen more than my own life.  I learned it
from my father's love for my mother, and from some guy named Jesus.

Selflessness is, like, for real, Man.
