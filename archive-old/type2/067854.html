So thereby robbing whatever value might be had for those of us who have the
original? How about if you add some sort of note that yours is a copy? That
won't take anything away from the humor in the book, and would protect the
original copies. It's highly inconsiderate when someone goes out making
&quot;new&quot; versions of a collectible item without considering the collectors and
working to protect them.
