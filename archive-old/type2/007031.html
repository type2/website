Subject:      1980 Vanagon Information Requested

Hi Vanatics,

 I'm beginning to write a description of the 1980 Vanagon models &amp; options
for
 the USA, as I have done for the 1986 to 1991 already.  Since I came &quot;into&quot;
 Vanagons in 1988, I don't know all that much about the earlier Vanagons and
I
 need a bit more help with these early years than I did on the newer vans.

 I have a photocopy of a 1980 brochure, but it doesn't answer all my
 questions.  I have descerned that there were basically 4 models that year:
 Vanagon (in 7 &amp; 9 seat versions),  Vanagon L ((in 7 &amp; 9 seat versions),
  Vanagon Camper (P22 - less equipped version), and Vanagon Camper (P27 -
more
 equipped version).

 I have some questions that I'd like the list's input on.

 1. Did all the 1980 Vanagons have chrome bumpers?
 Just the L models?  or just the L models and the campers?  or just the Ls
and
 the Camper P27?????   Did the ones without chrome bumpers (if any) have
black
 painted bumpers???

 2. Did all or just some of the models have opening wing windows??

 3. What is the ground clearance?  The brochure doesn't include this figure.
  If I can't get a definitive answer, I'll just use a figure from a later
year
 as an estimate.

 4. What is the height of the camper models?  The brochure doesn't say.  I
can
 just use a figure from a later year again if I don't get something specific
 for 1980.  The brochure does have a figure (77.2&quot;) for the non-Campers.

 5. What is the curb weight of the camper models?  The brochure doesn't say.
  I can just use a figure from a later year again if I don't get something
 specific for 1980.  The brochure does have a figure(3,087 lbs) for the
 non-Campers.

 6. The 1980 brochure mentions the availability of optional rear seat
 headrests in the non-Camper models.  The 1981 brochure does not include this
 option.  I don't recall ever seeing an early Vanagon with rear seat
 headrests.  Did they really produce this option or was it something that
they
 later (after the brochure printing) decided not to make available?

 7. The brochure mentions an auxillary heater as an option.  Where was this
 located?
 I'm assuming that this heater was the gasoline fueled heater that I've heard
 described.
 Is this correct?

 8. The brochure mentions a rear window wiper as an option.
 Does this optional wiper have an intermittant operation feature like later
 years?

 9. The brochure mentions optional swiveling front &quot;Captain's chairs&quot; for the
 NON-Camper models.  I've never seen a non-Camper with swiveling front
buckets
 ( a feature I wish I my 87 &amp; 88  had).  Like question #6, did they really
 produce this option or was it something that they later (after the brochure
 printing) decided not to make available.

 10.  If anyone has any information about 1980 Vanagons that is either more
 detailed that the brochure, or more accurate than the brochure, I'd LOVE to
 see it.  Also, I realize that the likelyhood of finding a window sticker for
 a 17 year old vehicle is pretty low, but if anyone has one, I'd REALLY
 appreciate a copy.

 Now I'll go off and think of some more questions.

Please respond to me directly, since while I'm on the Vanagon List, I'm noton
the Type2 list.  I'm at Syncrohead_at_aol_dot_com.

 Thanks. Any help is much appreciated.
