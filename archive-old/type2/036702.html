Subject: under dash parcel shelves - what are these?

I noticed in my WCM catalog a couple of things my 71 doesn't have, but maybe 
did at one time.  Were these shelves an option or something?  The other is a 
rubber mat for the seat pedestal.  Does anyone know what exactly it covers?, 
does it come down to the floor between seats?

Just wondering
