Steve,

I'm the crazy guy who mentioned using nylon rope for the sliding door seal
on my '71. As far as I know, it's always worked fine. I used a pink rubber
hose for the rear cargo door seal on the same bus. It worked MOSTLY, but I
did develop a slight leak somewhere. I'd try it again, but use some foam
insulation or clear silicone to fill the leaky spots. Got my parts at Home
Depot; they sell it by the foot. Measured twice, cut once. Bought samples;
made sure they fit. If you drive your bus there, you can check samples in
the parking lot; then go back in for the &quot;seals.&quot; Ideally, the hose should
fit independent of any adhesive. Be sure to not get it TOO big, though, or
you'll have to SLAM the door to get it closed. Time will shape it some,
though, too. The hose also can be cut longways with a razor blade to make a
roof seal, though ultimately, I didn't like the way that looked. A smaller
diameter hose might be better for that roof seal. I don't know. I tried the
smaller diameter, but went too far on the small side.

You may think I'm nuts, but at the time I was trying to be really
economical. Part of my logic was that, in a pinch I could use the rope to
tie off the bus and get pulled out of a ditch; the hose could double as an
Arkansas credit card (gas siphon). I make a little more money now and I'm
planning on saving up to buy real parts for my '67 as I restore her. Of
course, I could finish her in a year if I went the economy route. It'll take
me 3 years if I buy only real parts and go Van Bondo-- 8) just kidding,
Rusty. Who knows, I may just reconsider. If I go the economy way, maybe I
can afford more road trips and spend more time fishing. Probably I'll find
balance somewhere in between, do the work myself, and settle for MY best
work, even though that ain't show quality.

BTW, Home Depot sells fuel line and clamps too. You might want to check
those before you go to the hose section. Remember, bus fuel lines are in
mm's, not inches. A slight difference is important with fuel lines.

Have fun!  ;) Joe

&gt;I have a very bad rubber seal around the back flip up hatch on
&gt;my '71 bus.  I looked for a new seal in West Coast Metrics catalog
&gt;and about flipped when I saw that it was $102!!!
&gt;
&gt;Any other ideas that may work?  Or places where I could get the
&gt;rubber any cheaper?
&gt;
