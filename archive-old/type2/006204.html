A quick question about hydraulic lifters. I have just installed a new 1800
engine in my new (to me) 74 Transporter. The long block was built by AVP and
is running wonderfully [only 200 miles on her so far].
I seem to remember the PO telling me that the valves should be adjusted
after a few hundred miles, but does that mean to do a regular --ala Muir--
valve adjustment, or is it a special hydraulic lifter adjustment?

Any info is appreciated!

Thanks,
Dave
