It's never good for a vehicle to sit.  You should put a charger on the
battery every few months and turn the engine over (with the starter or by
hand) every month or so.  If you use the starter to turn the engine over,
be sure to charge the battery afterwards.

this will keep you in good shape for a few months.  More than this will
require more drastic measures.

&gt; Hi,
&gt; I was wondering.. (as you do)... My kombi has been sitting in my drive for
&gt; the last 3 months (stuffed carby among other things).. I can't afford to get
&gt; it fixed til May, how bad is it to have it just sit there for that long?? Is
&gt; there anything I should be aware of? (Other than people moving into it and
&gt; those spider webs all over it...)
