Subject: Re: [T2] Timing question (again)

Whenever a timing/distributor question comes up, does everyone hit delete
without reading it???

This question is why the answer ''always time your engine to the distributor
you have and not your engine&quot; has to be said over and over again until
everyone understands it!

Timing your engine 'by the book' at 10 after is only true IF you are using
distributor # 021 905 205J or 021 905 205N  AND you have vacuum at idle
connected to the retard side AND you are timing it with a light at idle.

Timing a mechanical only dist at 10 after severely retards the engine. Get the
correct dist, the correct book [Bentley], and the correct information. The
Muir book is fun to read when you get your 1st type1 engine but it is nothing
more than comic book for a typeIV engine.

All Bosch distributors have the numbers around the outside of the body. Some
are easier to see than others. You don't need the Bentley to get the specs for
it. Go here if you know the application:

Go here if you have the dist number and you want to know the application:

&gt; Last week I posted a question about timing my bus.
&gt; Unfortunately, I lied to you all. What I thought
&gt; was a stock distributor is really a mechanical advance one (I can't
&gt; find my Bentley right now and I don't know where the part number is
&gt; marked, so I'm not sure exactly which one I have.)
&gt;
&gt; Anyway, I timed it by feel last week, as my timing light was not working.
&gt; Today I got the timing light working and checked it. To recap, I timed
&gt; it by advancing it to max RPM at idle, then backed it off 4 degrees.
&gt; I've been driving it gently since then, and it's been doing fine.
&gt;
&gt; Today I checked it and it was advanced 20 degrees at idle (900rpm).
&gt; I retarded it to 10 ATDC per Muir and then the old problems came back --
&gt; rough idle after it warms up and almost no power (0-60 took over
&gt; a minute where it used to take about 25 seconds, and it maxes out at just
&gt; over 60MPH on flats, 50-55 going over overpasses.)
&gt;
&gt; This didn't seem right to me at all, so I advanced it to TDC at idle.
&gt; I checked it at 3000 RPM and it's advanced 24 degrees. Power is back
&gt; and it idles fine when warm nows, but I'm back to wondering if this
&gt; is good for the engine or not. Does that advance curve sound scary?
&gt;
&gt; I do have a stock distributor on my spare engine, and will probably
&gt; install that soon, but in the meantime I need to drive to Portland
&gt; tomorrow (120 miles each way) and would rather not blow up the engine
&gt; in the process. Opinions?
&gt;
&gt; Oh, the engine is a 1.8l, dual carb, manual tranny.
