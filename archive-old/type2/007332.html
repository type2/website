Subject: Heat (lucky idiot)

 Its amazing I'm still alive considering how I used to heat my van in the
old days.  I had an 66 split set up for comfortable living back in the late
70's and was surviving  particularly cold winter.  It was my practice to
pump up my colman one burner gas stove and let it burn all night on my table
top.  It would hiss away on low for about eight hours before going out.  The
air always seemed fresh, I never had any symptoms and I never died....not
even once. But that was a fairly drafty old bus.  I think I'd have frozen to
death without the heater. 

I'd never do such a thing anymore...And certainly don't recommend it to anyone.
