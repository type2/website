Hi listees;
   OK, here's the latest on Nikki's journey. Just got off the phone with
her and she's in kinda limp mode. She called from Eldorado, Tx, about
halfway between Sonora and San Angelo. She had been experiencing some
troubling problems with the bus in the aftermath of ingesting a deer.
She had the engine lights come on, pulled over and the engine seemed
hot, and the oil level seemed high, but did not smell gassy. A passing
guy stopped and found a hose to the carb off (can't remember if it was
the left or right), replaced it, checked the belts wires and hoses and
everything seems to be OK, but the bus is still running sluggish, not
going much faster than 55. The E-Brake mechanism did suffer some damage
in the crash, but she tested the bus on a slight incline and it seems to
be rolling freely.
   She has made contact with fellow listee Mike Gensler as well and his
long distance diagnosis is as puzzled as mine. Can't really put a finger
on it.
   At about 2:30 CST she was to be leaving Eldorado toward San Angelo
(about 45 miles) where she has made phone contact with a friend of David
Schwartz who, though not a VW guy, is mechanically inclined. All
attempts to reach Rex Rogers have been in vain, most of the numbers I've
received haven't worked for one reason or the other, but Mike Gensler
simply called directory assistance (doh!) and got a valid number for
Rex, but was only able to leave a voice mail. The number Rex has listed
on the AIRS site is off by one digit. (Should be 915-659-0154 instead of
the number on the AIRS site.)
   So at the moment Nikki is limping toward San Angelo, Texas on Hwy.
277. She promised to keep in touch with me with progress reports and if
any of you have any ideas as to what may be going on with her bus,
please p-mail me and I'll pass them on to her when she next makes
contact.
   If all else goes to heck, Mike's offered to head that way with his
spare engine.
   And Nikki no longer thinks deer are &quot;cute&quot;...said something about
following semi's during night travels in the future (let the big guy
take the hit.)
