Subject: Re: [T2] cylinder head changes

&gt; volks,
 sorry to bother everyone on their lazy sunday! my questions is this. what
 is the standard stock bore size for 1600cc heads and what is it for
 1800cc. also, what is the the standard valve size over the years. i am
 purchasing heads for my 1800cc, but found a decent deal on what i think
 are 1600 heads. i have to choose between 40x32, 44x37.5, &amp; 42x37.5 valve
 sizes. also, is there any signifigant risk in opening up the bore on 1600
 heads? one other thing, can anyone explain to me exactly what &quot;porting&quot;
 is?
 74 westy in OR

Your 74 uses a 1800 type 4 engine.
1600 heads are for a type 1 engine. They will not fit on your type 4 engine.

Porting is opening up and polishing the ports for max flow.
