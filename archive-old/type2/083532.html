Subject: Re: [T2] Kadron Rebuilding

These are kadrons and they have the old manifolds. 
Usally I wouldn't bother with the rebuild and just go
for a weber progressive or something but I am just
flat ass broke at the moment.
Thanks,
Tyler

&gt; Doubtful you have Kadrons on this motor for until

&gt; were not available...........Probably old solex's
&gt; (not exactly the same)
&gt; Usually the shafts are quite worn in these and
&gt; rebuilding will provide only
&gt; marginal results and often open a can of worms. 
&gt; Check the shafts for wear
&gt; before disassembly and take it from there.

&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; I am about to embark on the rebuilding of my dual
&gt; &gt; kadron carbs on my 74 1.8. If there is anybidy who
&gt; has
&gt; &gt; done this in the past who has any does and don'ts
&gt; or
&gt; &gt; tips I would be most appreciative. Does anybody
&gt; know
&gt; &gt; of a manual for the kadrons, I would like to keep
&gt; them
&gt; &gt; on for at least a year until I can afford to do
&gt; the
&gt; &gt; engine rebuild and new carbs at the same time.
&gt; &gt; TIA
&gt; &gt; Tyler
