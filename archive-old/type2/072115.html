&gt;Volks- Should you see the points sparking if you take the distributor cap
&gt;off while someone is cranking the engine? I know that the points are
&gt;supposed to complete the circuit and send the charge from the coil to the
&gt;plugs at the right time, and so I am wondering if the sparking I am seeing
&gt;is actually arcing, causing the plugs to fire at the wrong time and
&gt;generally keep the engine from running.

Joel,

If you think about how you time your engine, you put a sensor on the #1
plug wire, so you are sensing the moment at which the high voltage appears
on the wire to fire the plug, not the moment the points open.  So it
doesn't really matter whether the points are arcing, because you are not
using that as a timing reference.  The condensor is supposed to reduce the
amount of arcing, but it's not perfect, so you will always get some.  The
arc occurs because of the nature of the coil.  When you have a steady
current flowing through a coil (ie with points closed), and then suddenly
break the circuit, the coil tries to keep the current flowing, the voltage
across the coil shoots up, and the current eventually makes it across the
gap.  The coil is actually a transformer with many more turns in the
secondary (HT side) than the primary, so the high voltage that you get when
the points open appears as an even bigger voltage at the plugs.
This is probably a lot more than you wanted to know.  Anyway, sparking is
OK unless there is a lot, in which case you probably need a new condensor.
And new points.
