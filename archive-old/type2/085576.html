Subject: unsafe tires?

Now that the hard work is behind me and the bus is on the road I'm starting
to pay attention to all the various bus details this list has exposed me to
sure as tires.

I have lots of receipts that give me a good idea of the history of my bus
but I have no info on when tires were purchased. I'd like to get some
feedback on my tires:

- I believe the front tires are perfect for the bus.

- The rear tires seem underrated and I do get a lot of highway buffeting.
What should I do?

- The spares are &quot;new&quot; but are they too old to risk putting on in the snow?

Front:
Continental Contrans
185R14 6PR
Load C 1610 lbs at 55 psi
Radial 93/97 Q
Made in Great Britain
(~5000 miles; purchased in 1995 from VW dealer in Coquitlam when the bus
started to pull heavily to the right and it revealed that the tread has
seperated and a large bubble appeared on the tire.  I can't find the receipt
but they were expensive).

Rear:
Maverick LTR
LT195/75R14 M+S
Load C 1435 lbs at 50 psi
Radial 93 N
Made in Canada
(unknown purchase date; unknown mileage)

Spares:
Michelin X
185R14 M+S
Load 1540 lbs at 40 psi
Reinforced Radial
Made in Belgium
(These have unfortunately been studded for the snow but they have always
been on rims and inflated; means that these tires are likely from 1982!)
