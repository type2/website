I have just purchased a 74ish Camper (Year to be verified). It has been
sitting for a year or so and started up every so often (2-3months). I have
done the usual scout around checking what needs to be done. Basically
everything is complete and it is in need of some TLC. The only Bug bear I
have is that all the Ball Joint and tie rod end rubbers are shot thus
requiring replacement. The questions I have are, anything else I should
check out given that it hasn't been driven for a year and pressing in/out
the Ball Joints, can you use a drift or is it Hydraulic press city, be
interested to hear stories :). Cheers.
