Subject: Re: [T2] '78 Can't get idle going fast enough - FIXED!

Hi All,

Thanks to everyone who offered suggestions on things to try. I'm going to =
list what finally worked for me here, as well as for the benefit of the =
archive, a summary of the advice that I got that would be good things to =
try for this kind of problem.=20

When I was playing with the bus earlier and going through some of the =
tests that were recommended, I pulled off the connector to the AFM and =
started up the engine. I was just curious as to how it would run. It is =
common knowledge, that a bus will idle with the AFM disconnected, although =
you certainly can't drive it like that. Anyway, with the AFM disconnected, =
the bus idled normally. I'm not sure that this proved anything, but...

Over the years I have collected some spare FI parts. I put in my spare Air =
Flow Meter. I wasn't expecting it to work. I figured I would connect the =
AFM without the air box and push the little door part with my finger to =
see if simulating extra air would do anything. To my surprise, putting in =
the spare AFM made the bus idle normally. So, I mounted it properly to the =
air box and installed it, then I was able to turn the idle screw back in =
to a normal level and achieve a proper idle.

I'm not sure if this is because the new AFM is &quot;good&quot; and the old one =
&quot;bad&quot;, or whether this is just a rich AFM which is compensating for a yet =
to be discovered vacuum leak or low fuel pressure (as Karl suggested). It =
is strange, because it was my impression that AFM's usually fail rich as =
their springs weaken over time. I think I may swing by Lou's on Monday and =
&quot;borrow&quot; a fuel pressure reading and a vacuum reading.

For now, I am a happy camper. Tomorrow the bus gets its first oil change, =
and I attempt to fix the couple of oil leaks that AVP provided free with =
the engine.

---
For the benefit of the archive.. some other things that I checked based on =
advice from the list:

 -Plugged up openings in the S tube to isolate against an air leak going =
though one of those other tubes. I used rubber stoppers I bought at the =
local corner hardware store. I also plugged off the tube that feeds the =
brake booster &amp; decel valve.
 -Checked ground connections of several wires which connect under the =
intake air distributor. I did this by feeling with my fingers not by =
disassembling everything.
 -Checked that wires were connected to sensor which is under the cold =
start valve.
 -Made sure AFM (Air Flow Meter) is plugged in. (Note that this sounds =
obvious, but I have done it before. This usually causes the bus to idle =
normally, but will want to die if you increase throtttle.)=20
 -Blocked off EGR. Since I put in a new EGR valve, I put a piece of gasket =
paper under where it connects to the Air Distibutor to isolate that some =
air was not leaking in somehow through the EGR.
 -Verified connection to temp sensor #2 (in cyl head near #3 cylinder).
 -Check fuel pressure. (This advice from Karl, I intend on following on =
Monday)
 -Check vacuum at port between #1 and #2 cylinders. Should be 15&quot; or so at =
idle.
 -Adjusting the spring in the AFM.
 -Use the Bosch L-Jetronic Troubleshooting manual (This is hosted in a =
couple of places, and linked to in the Library)
 -Of course, sprayed LOTS of carb cleaner over every hose, intake =
manifold, fuel injector, etc. to see if I could detect a change in idle.

Happy Bussin'

Mark
