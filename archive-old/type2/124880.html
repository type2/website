Subject: Re: [T2] Sunroof drain

My 74 has a sunroof with no seal as well. They sell for $200+. I bought a 4'
x 2' piece of magnetic material at a local sign shop ($40CDN) it came in
white, which is the color as the roof. I cut it into 4&quot; strips and voila, no
more rain in the bus, and I can still open the sunroof. I had the bus doing
75 mph and the magnetic strips stayed put. I left a few small gaps for air
circulation.

Subject: [T2] Sunroof drain


&gt; Hi all,
&gt;
&gt; The new to me bus has a sunroof.  Very cool.  It opens/closes like it
&gt; should.  But alas it has no seal (will be looking for one on-line
&gt; shortly - suggestions on suppliers gladly accepted).  In the rainiest
&gt; state I know of (WA), it is not good to not have a seal.  So while
&gt; waiting for the seal she has a temporary strip of duct tape.  I feel so
&gt; Donald Trump.  However, in learing of my need for the seal, I spy some
&gt; drains for the sunroof.  Problem is they don't drain.  In fact, when I
&gt; took my sons for a ride, one of the boys was drenched by the pool of
&gt; water the van had collected in the roof.  Is there a procedure to
&gt; diagnose just what is wrong with the drains?  Should one chase the issue
&gt; with a coat hanger?  Give the van a shot of Drano? Do a one legged
&gt; anti-rain dance? Or shall I simply invest in 3M knowing that I will
&gt; forever be buying Duct tape?
