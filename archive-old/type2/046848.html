Subject: [T2] My Friday Question

Very interesting. I think only 2 people responded saying that they had sold a 
Westy for $7,000.00 or more. The majority seemed to think paying this much or 
more was insane. Nobody responded admitting they had paid a price this high. 
Maybe next week I'll ask the Vanagon list: Are Westy syncro's really worth 
$25,000.00? LOL. Goodnight all.    Jeff S.
