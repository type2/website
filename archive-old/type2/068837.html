Subject: Re: CD Ignition

While we're on the topic of CDI, I'm wondering if anyone has tried using a
stock CDI module off a Porsche or some other make and adapting it for their
aircooled VW.  I was recently perusing a Porsche catalog (Performance
Specialties, I think) and saw CDI modules--these are stock equip on some
Porsches?--New for $700-$1000 (??). If I were able to pick one up for cheap
off a parts car (and I'm talking a lot cheaper than the New price!), could
it be easily configured for use with a VW, or is it designed for a specific
ignition system?  I suppose buying it from Universal would be easier, but I
can't help myself from trying to do things the hard way ;).

BTW, what (aside from their logo) would make the Porsche versions so
godawful expensive?
