Subject: Campground res for Jax FL VW Shows 4/01

I've just made two nights campground reservations at Kathryn Abbey Hanna Park for the &quot;Busses at the Beach&quot; and &quot;VWs by the Seaside&quot; shows coming up in 
Jacksonville Beach FL on 4/21 and 4/22.  I'm in site 97, for those who may care to approach/avoid.  I plan to arrive Friday afternoon and leave Sunday after the 
show.

You can email the campground for info at CWaldo_at_coj_dot_net, but to make a reservation you have to call them at 904 249 4700, and they take a nonrefundable first-
night's deposit of about $18 for a site with electric.  IMO this isn't unreasonable, but opinions vary.  It's a nicely appointed campground in a park right on the Atlantic.

IMPORTANT: When I told the guy I was camping in a VW bus, he hemmed and hawed until I told him it was a camper van.  Apparently they've had problems with 
transients coming in and &quot;camping&quot; in their minivans (there's a grey area between &quot;camping&quot; and &quot;sleeping in your vehicle&quot;).  So when you call, make it real clear 
that you're in a CAMPER BUS and be ready to do some creative explaining if you think yours might not look like a camper to the uninitiated when you arrive.  Hell, 
bring a pup tent and set it up next to your bus - you don't have to sleep in it. ;-)

If that attitude or cost frosts you, there are a couple of state parks within reasonable distance, and AFAIK they're not as picky (Hanna Park is run by City of Jax).  Last 
year, some of the guys slept in their busses right in the show lot, but I hear it was pretty noisy -- locals cruising through with thumping stereos, bar traffic, etc.  IMO it 
was worth $18 to have a campfire and sleep among the trees.

If you haven't been, this is an excellent show venue - right on the beach, with a seafood festival nearby.  Due to its location you get a lot of non-VW gawkers, which 
is good and bad - mostly good, I think.  Last year there was a great kegger at Mark Pribanic's after the bus show.

If anyone wants to hook up at the campground, I'll be in the red 71 westy.
