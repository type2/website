Subject: Parking Brake Cable and backing plate  ('68)

Hi,

I cannot remove the backing plate from the cable (or vice versa). I have the
backing plate hanging from the cable.. nothing else is holding the plate on.
There is considerable rust but I don't know what I should wrestle with. I
don't know how the cable comes out. How does the cable attach to the backing
plate? Is it just a plastic sheath with the cable inside and should it just
slide out? Which way do I pull it out? It looks like the backing plate
should pull off it?

Any help would be appreciated. This is really ridiculous.


Jen :-)
