Subject: oild cooler removal
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

   Please bear with me, I asked awhile back about getting an oild cooler out
of a 76' vw bus(2000cc FI etc etc) I had some wonderful responses, but my PC
crashed and burned, so I am ignorant once more.  How do I get that baby out
of my baby without pulling the whole engine?? The exaust would not survive
the move, and I cannot afford that right now.  Thanks in advance!

sorry, had to say that.
Why would you do that, when air cooling is so cool?!?
