Hi Volks,

Craig wrote to the List about a single cab he'd spotted:
&gt; trivia: had the post-73 turn signals in front, up near the
windscreen; rear
&gt; had the 68-71 turn/brake bezels with the seperate backup bezels...
all the
&gt; late pickups had this, right? something to do with the bed
interfering with
&gt; where the late-bay light housings would go back there - please
correct me
&gt; if i'm wrong.

Well you are wrong.  Pick-ups got the new-style taillights in 8/71
just like the bus and van models did.  I have photographic evidence of
this for the incredulous but not yet in computer-readable form.  If
you have the book &quot;Original VW Bus&quot; by Lawrence Meredith however,
you'll find shots of a late model loaf army crewcab with the late
style taillights.  I assume what you saw was an early model that was
repaired with late model mose sheetmetal (as early model nose
sheetmetal is NLA as far as I know).

Airhowlingly yours,
    Erik (who is considering selling his Winter Golf for a Subaru --
comments?)

'62, '71, '72, and '72 highroof panel van (always looking for more)
&quot;You mean there's such a thing as a VW Bus with rear side windows?&quot;
