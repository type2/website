Subject: re: My clutch died today

Are there any noises coming from the trans when the clutch is engaged? It 
has been my experience that if the clutch cable is bad it will usually just 
brake. If the boden tube is screwed up you will get clutch chatter. If the 
clutch is bad (worn or covered with oil) it will slip, but if the pedal has 
very little travel and it is hard to shift it is probably the throw out 
bearing or clutch fork. The little clips that hold the t.o. bearing can pop 
off of the grove on the fork and thus make the t.o. hang at an angle. This 
will give you a kind of grinding noise when the clutch is engaged. I once 
had the clutch return spring on the trans brake and that gave a similar feel 
but I think that was a fluke.
