&gt; I pre-paid for my order months ago and it hasn't been delivered.
&gt; I am again going down to Arizona in a week and will check into the
situation.


Dawn recently went through some personal problems, which put PLF somewhat on
the back burner for a while.  This resulted in lengthy delays on some
orders.  I know that she is now caught up on all of my orders (many of the
canvases that I sell are made by her), and believe that she is nearly caught
up on her other orders as well.  Because Dawn's canvases are literally made
one by one, relatively long lead times are not uncommon even under normal
circumstances. When people order PLF canvas from me I usually tell them to
allow a good month (whereas I can get canvas from other vendors within
days). On the other hand, she makes an exceptionally good product, so it's a
trade-off of time for quality.
