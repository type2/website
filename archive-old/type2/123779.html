Subject: Bad coil and Pertronix

Hey, a big thanks to all for their advise.

 When I play with something and it suddenly doesn't work it always leaves me
wondering &quot;what did I do wrong&quot;.

Anyway, I guess you can't trust Pertronix out of the box! I just went out
and threw in the old Dizzy and points system and sure enough the bus fired
right up, a little adjust of the timing and it's humming.

So just to confirm. I had the 009 with the Pertronix installed, now I have
the old vacuum dizzy with the points back in. It seemed the firing line for
the first plug is wildly different with the 009. Going from TDC (we'll the
12 Deg of the dizzy shaft per my year) and the rotor pointing to the mark on
the rim. I'm hoping I have no problem exchanging the bad Pertronix at the
shop. I'm thinking of just getting the ones to fit my current dizzy with the
vacuum? The shop is 2 hours from where I live, hence the frustration of
getting a bad one. It was nothing to do with the wiring of the coil. It just
got confusing when I got no spark and left me pondering.

I don't suppose it could be the distributor? Seemed like more of a hassle to
exchange the points and condenser for a test.

Cheers everyone for their  input,

Dave
