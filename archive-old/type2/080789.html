Subject: Colorado info wanted

Hi Folks,
    This coming summer I'll be in Colorado with my family for a 2 week
vacation.  I'm wondering if there is anyplace to rent a bus in or near
Denver.  And while I've got your attention, any VW shows or bus camp outs in
that area between June 27th and July 11th ?
