Subject: RE:  Bus Aerodynamics

&gt;Just for kicks, I calculated the power required to push our busses on 
&gt;down the road... the results are at http://www.instability_dot_com/vw/aero.html

While I definitely agree that the amount of HP required to propel a vehicle
goes up algebraically with its speed due to increased wind resistance, I
believe Chad's chart is a little pessimistic.  I know for certain that my
old 1.8 engine (guestimated 60-65HP) could push my poor 'ol 4000 pound 73
poptop Westy up to 95 mph.  Of course, because of the gearing, normal
cruising speed is limited to 70-80 mph unless you like rebuilding motors
every 3 months.

That being said, here's some real-world observations for your consideration
and amusement.  These observations are from the same Westy with a fresh
bone-stock fuel injected 914 2.0 motor (rated at 95 HP) mated to a 5 speed
Porsche 901 transmission:

1. 4th gear has a very similar final drive ratio to the original
transmission's 4th gear.
2. 5th gear drops the RPM by about 800.
3. In 85 degree weather, cruising 75 MPH on the highway in 4th (4200 RPM),
my oil temps get up to about 240.
4. Same condition as above, but in 5th gear (3400 RPM), my oil temps drop to
about 210.
5. With no head wind and on flat ground, I can shift into 5th at 70 MPH and
continue to accellerate up to 95 mph, but after that, the accelleration gets
harder and is is definitely affected by hills and head winds.
6. In a 20 mph head wind (read wind resistance equal to speed+20mph), I have
trouble maintaining 75 mph in 5th and must constantly use 4th gear on even
the slightest inclines to keep my speed above 70 mph.
7. Buses were not designed to be driven much above 75 mph and catching a
side wind gust at 85+ mph is not much fun.
8. Blowing past Suburbans on I-10 at 95 mph is very gratifying, but re-read
observation #7.
9. First gear is a lot taller than the stock bus 1st gear - it will see me
up to 30 mph (vs 20 for a stock bus), but does require more clutch-slipping
when starting on steep inclines.
10. For some reason that still eludes me, my gas mileage is worse with this
new setup than it was with the old one (of course, I do drive a lot faster
now...)
