Subject: Splitty Crew Cab Seat Qs

When I took possession of my &quot;new&quot; 1961 Doublecab last month - it came
without seats.. Two questions for the restoration crowd (don't worry,
there will be many more later when winter is over)..

1. Is the rear seat unique to the doublecab? If so, how hard will it be
to find one.. I do have the metal frame that the seat sits on..

2. Will the 1/3 2/3 bench seat work in the front seat area. I know it
originally came with a full length bench seat (and I will find one
eventually) but I do have an extra front seat set-up from a 64..

Thanks.. Even though I can't do much work on it this winter, I'm
dreaming of cruising around in this double-cab soon..
