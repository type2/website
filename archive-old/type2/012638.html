hello list. i was wondering if anyone has ever put the westy cabinets
from a vanagon into a bay window bus? is it possible? will the
cabinets have to be trimmed or refitted for the bay interior? just tossing
around ideas for now, but wanted any info from someone that may have 
attempted this before.

i dont know what year the vanagon is, but the bay window is a '73.

TIA.
