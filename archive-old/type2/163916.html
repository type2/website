Subject: Re: [T2] MexiMotor experience

Chris,

Interesting feedback.  I think my Meximotor is fantastic in terms of both
power and economy, but I'll grant that it replaced an engine that ran on
three cylinders and did 0-60 in about two minutes.

On my last long trip, though, I was getting right around 20mpg on the
highway at 55-60mph.  It's less efficient at 65, and also less efficient if
the timing isn't advanced enough.  (I still use the 009 that came with my
Bus.)

I don't drive to work, and I've never made the effort to see what kind of
mileage I get on the occasional short trips that I make within the city.

Miles, '71 Dragon Bus in Seattle
