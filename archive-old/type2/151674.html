Subject: Moving Trip Report (was Re: [T2] cv boots...lazy way)

Actually, IIRC, Don asked the list if the split boots were any good, and 
he was warned to stay away from them.

but that's just how I remember it.

Bus Content:

Towed my '71 bus from Baltimore to my new house (!!!) in Pittsburgh last 
weekend: body work that was started with the help of my roomate never did 
get done, so I figured trailering it was a better option than putting the 
engine back in, given the HUGE hole in the rear quarter panel (new panel will 
eventually be welded in).

Noticed after loading it onto the trailer that someone had apparently been 
futzing with the sliding door (which has a propensity to pop out of the 
track mid-way and drop to the ground).  The lower roller is now sheared 
off and the door corner even MORE dented than before.  Bummer.   Good 
thing I have a spare door.  

Of course I closed the door before I noticed this, so when I had to 
re-open it to load more gear in I realized that the door corner was now 
stuck in the new-ish sliding door seal and in that corner.  Time to get 
the crowbar to open it up.  Not particularly happy about the situation, 
but glad to be moving into my own space where if I f**k up my bus, its 
my fault, not anyone else's. (Keep repeating &quot;This will all be over soon&quot; 
in your head, while trying not to think of the fact that it's 10 pm and 
you still have a big trip ahead of you)

So, we got under way for the 230+ mile trip to pittsburgh driving in the 
15' budget rental truck towing the '71 on the car carrier.  Stopped at the 
7-11 on Frederick Rd to get foodstuffs, coffee, and start towards getting 
my Class C by learning how to back up a large truck with a trailer and not 
jacknife it (in the narrow-ish back lot behind the 7-11 that is marked &quot;NO 
TRUCK TURN-AROUND&quot;).  Tightened down the wheel straps, checked all the 
connections, AND AWAAAAAAAAY WE GO!

10 miles later we were on I-70 heading west and within a half-hour I was 
starting to get antsy: Wasn't there a rest area around here somewhere?  I 
had really wanted to stop around the 30-50 mile mark to check and tighten 
any connections but did not relish pulling over on the side of the road, 
or, for that matter, finding a place where I could turn around if I were 
to exit somewhere.  

At the ~65 mile mark, I caved and pulled over to the side of the road: lo 
and behold, the webbing holding the passenger side wheel down had slipped 
off.  Doh!  So I dutifully put it back on, tightened the driver-side 
webbing a nudge, and got back on the road.

I pulled over 30 minutes later to find that the passenger side webbing had 
come off AGAIN, so I futzed with it a bit, trying to better orient the 
strap and make sure it was centered, etc., so it wouldn't come off.  By
this time I'm starting to get a little nervous.

The third time I pulled over (or maybe it was the second, it was a LONG 
DAY), I decided to do it right:  I took the VW-issued tow cable (came with 
Dad&amp;Mom's '71 beetle from the factory), wrapped it around the 
passenger-side of the front beam and around the trailer, figuring &quot;Ok 
now *that's* not going anywhere&quot;.  Then I took another chain with a hook 
and removable link for a DOUBLE safety, but that wouldn't reach all the 
way from the beam to the trailer.  Instead I put it around the beam and 
hooked it around the passenger-tire webbing, hopefully to keep it in 
place. (In retrospect, I probably could have put it around the front tow loop on 
the body and reached the trailer.  Oh well.)  I safeywired all my 
connections (thanks to Dad, who thought to send me off with safety wire!) 
and we got back on the road.

I felt much better after all of that.

The next time I stopped, the passenger-side webbing was still in place and 
everything else looked good.

Around 5 am we pulled into my street only to find that there was no room 
to park a moving truck + trailer anywhere.  To boot, there were enough 
cars parked on the street that there was no way I could navigate into my 
driveway - its a narrow path run at the beginning, given the hedges on 
either side of it.

Not seeing many other options, we pulled around the block looking for a 
spot (but not real keen on the idea of not parking in front of my house) 
and in coming up the REALLY STEEP HILL (by the way, for the uninitiated, 
Pittsburgh has heaps of REALLY STEEP hills, rivaling (and probably 
surpassing) San Francisco), I heard a noise.  It was kind of like the 
normal &quot;trailer bouncing around when going over bumps&quot; noise, but 
ever-so-slightly different.

We made it 20 yards down the road before I heard the noise again and 
stopped.

Wow.

When cresting the huge hill and turning onto my street (which is flat), 
the ball popped out of the trailer hitch.

Wow.

So the trailer tongue is resting on the ground, while the trailer is still 
connected to the truck by safety chains.  Oh boy.  I know that sucker was 
in the hitch as good as it could be owing to the fact that my father and I 
had spent about 15 minutes with various implements of destruction 
VERIFYING that it wouldn't go in any further, culminating in me using the 
crowbar with his 200lb frame standing on the trailer about a foot from the 
ball.  It still wasn't as snug as we would have liked (i.e. it didn't look 
foolproof), but it was as good as it was goign to get.

So we dutifully jacked up the trailer and reconnected it, noting that the 
webbing had ONCE AGAIN come off the passenger tire, and drove down the 
street, wondering what the heck our next move was.

To my relief, my neighbor came out and said she'd move her car in 5 
minutes, as she had to take her son to work (at 5:20 am on a Sunday 
morning, its the last thing I expected to happen).  We parked and went to 
bed.

Thankfully, my busses are all in one place again.

Whee!
