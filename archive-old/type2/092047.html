Subject: '73 European Westy FS


Hi Folks,

Just thought I'd let anyone interested know that a buddy of mine has a
Euro floor plan Westy FS.

This was purchased New in '73 my buddy is second owner...

Has full width bed in the pop-top and a full width bottom bunk (no
suicide cabinet on rear passenger side).

Closet is floor to ceiling behind the driver...

Body is currently in primer after most of the body work has been done
(replaced cut and flared rear wheel wells)

Asking price is $1000 but that apparently is very negotiable...

Located in Marblehead MA

He has asked me to facilitate the sale (as the Bus will hopefully be
residing here this weekend), so any inquires can be made to
