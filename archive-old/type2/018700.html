David S. just left my house about 10 min ago.  (Ripon, WI)
He's well on his way to Sister Bay WI with no problems whatsoever.... we
just went and ate at Taco Bell (50% discount...I work there.... thanks
for the treat David!)  and cruised around town for a while and stopped
at some fellow bussers house...
great guy!

He should be back home in 2 weeks or so...
His bus is really nice too!  A 73 blue hightop Safare camper...nice!
lot of custom work....nice guage setup!
