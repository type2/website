&gt;Just got Freebirds turnkey 2 L dual carb engine today (300lbs shipping 
&gt;weight!   I was intrigued with the Itty bitty starter.  The sticker on it 
&gt;says Bosch SR15N part number's 6 004 AA0 021 and it's just about the same 
&gt;size as a 14 oz can of beans (not including the solenoid).

I must strongly advise you put in an SR17X. 911 specs are insurance of long 
and flawless function with only battery and cable maintenance. It is the 
ideal upgrade and called for by Bosch as such for the early T-IV's as well. 
Fits like a glove with no issues.
