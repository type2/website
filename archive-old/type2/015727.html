Hi Scott,

The thread on warm air for the type IV carbs has triggered these
questions.

Why preheat the carb air?  Does it make a difference in a FI system?

I realize that colder air is denser than hot air (except for the hot air
from politicians) and I'm figuring that there is more energy potential
available in cold air.  I also have noticed that in a few racing
equipment catalogs, that there are devices to cool the air.

Would anybody care to explain the physics/mechanics behind all this?

Thanks!!

You´re right about the fact that cold air is denser and cold air therefore
can transport more air/fuel mixture to the cylinders. 
But there´s a limit to everything...... On the type1 engine, with the carb
in the middle and with long manifold tubes the mixture gets too cold and
the gasoline starts to separate from the air again. The vacuum itself also
helps to lower the temperature. This results in large gasoline drops
instead of the &quot;gas&quot; or fog form it had when it left the carberuttor. VW
hot rodders use to block of the heat risers to the manifold to gain
horsepower. On a standard  untouched 1600 engine this results in about two
horsepowers in the upper rev range. WOW! 

If you gain something you also loose something. In this case you get flat
spots in the lower rev range, making a bus a PITA to drive. When the
mixture´s speed is high in the manifold it can maintain the gas form it had
leaving the carb. But in the lower speeds the fuel &quot;drops&quot; and is for a
moment leaning out the mixture.

On dual carb and fuel injected engines the manifold tubes are much shorter
and this is not as much a problem. At least not in warm climates (which I
lived in one...) Type4 guys with problems are those who buy an after market
single carb manifold. Theese manifolds have one tube from each inlet
channel in the cylinder head all the way to the large plenum chamber under
the carb. In theese the mixture speed gets so low at any engine speed that
they would need heating at any outdoor temperature. Think about it, the
volume in these manifolds is almost as large as the cylinder volume in the
engine!!

Belive me, I´ve tried to live without heating for the carb in below
freezing temperatures . I could have got less exercise going to work on my
bicycle:-)

PS. Bought that Dolphin blue color but haven´t got it sprayed on yet.

If freezing in a VW bus makes a man out of me,
