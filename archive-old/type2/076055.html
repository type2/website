and your route to and from??

Bob

&gt; Hello list,
&gt; I'm going to be in Norfolk, VA for about two weeks from 22 Oct thru 2 Nov. If 
&gt; anyone could help with directions to any junk yards or VW shops (repair parts 
&gt; dealers) I will be looking for various parts for my many different VWs and a 
&gt; few for friends. I am also looking for flea markets or the best place (store, 
&gt; shop, connections) to get HotWheels, and Matchbox. And a good place to have 
&gt; my birthday dinner on the 28th of October (only 29 for the 15th time:). Any 
&gt; help would be greatly appreciated.
&gt;
