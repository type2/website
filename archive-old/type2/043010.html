Subject: blinkers

The mysterious VW gremlin has showed up again.

My blinkers have been fine and then a few days ago (after a ton of NE rain) I 
get nothing except a quick click and the blinker lights don't stay on, same 
with the hazards, no blinking. Fuses are fine. In the past if a bulb was out, 
or a connection at the light was little loose, one blinker would blink very 
fast, I'd remedy the problem and it was back to normal. 71 Westy.

        TIA,
                Andy
