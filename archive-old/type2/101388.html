Subject: Re: [T2] Question for Type1 experts on Valves

Thanks Jason,

That was another test I was going to do, but I got it up on the stand
(mounted bell housing) before I was able to test it.

This hit was more a hard glancing blow off of (through) the left rear
tire.  Knocked the car around 180 degrees before the suburban was able
to touch the engine, and destroyed that fender and wheel, body and pan
just behind the door.  It knocked the car up over a curb which caught
the exhaust system (one week old) and mangled it.  I think the
transmission took most of the blow (internal to the car) from the half
shaft being slammed into the side casing hard enough for the frame forks
to be warped and the nose piece of the trans to be broken off.  

I will check end play though.  Maybe a quick check on the pulley end
first.

Thanks!

Bob

&gt; I can't comment about your intake valve laping as being good enough or
&gt; not, but I can point something else out. If this car was rear-ended
&gt; then check the flywheel endplay!
