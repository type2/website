Subject: Re: The Original &quot;Grendel&quot;

&gt;  I keep meaning to ask about the name &quot;Grendel&quot;.
&gt; 
&gt;  It's from mythology as I recall. Anyone got a &quot;good&quot; encyclopedia?

Grendel is the mythical beast that is Beowulf's nemesis. Beowulf persues 
Grendel down into its (do I vaguely remember 'her'?) lair and does it in.

More recently, there is a book called 'Grendel' (don't remember the 
author) written from the beast's perspective.
