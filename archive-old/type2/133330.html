&gt; &gt;&gt; I'm not gonna beg for a weber single, but my FI install on the
&gt; &gt;&gt; westfakia does seem to be mocking me.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; FI installs can be tricky, but here is one case when Doc Tim is really
&gt; &gt; righht on the money, follow the trouble shooting guide, if you don't
&gt;
&gt; I went out this afternoon and swapped in the fuel pressure regulator
&gt; from the sunroof bus. The I verified that I am getting a decent spray
&gt; from injectors on 1,2 &amp; 3. Last night I assumed that #4 was
&gt; representative of all the others, but I now know that is not the case.
&gt; Injector #4 refuses to fire, even when I use the wire from #3.  So I
&gt; swapped in a different injector and it too refuses to fire.  I might
&gt; just have a dud spare, but there are more where that came from, I'll
&gt; update on that situation soon.

might want to swap injectors as well as wires, will verify that it is
indeed the injector (although I can't think of anything else but a clogged
fuel line to that injector)

&gt; It still won't idle though. It will light up  but will only run
&gt; briefly. If I play with the throttle I can keep it running, but only at
&gt; high revs. Adjusting the timing helps a little, but not much. The
&gt; inability to idle can't be helped by a dead number 4 injector, so I
&gt; will head back to the driveway now to try swapping in another spare. I
&gt; am also going to get a fuel pressure gauge on it ASAP.

yeah the injector will cause some probs but a 3cyl engine will still idle
and not die, just runs rough..   the idling is a mix of several
adjustments and parts,  although it sounds like it could be a vacuum leak

&gt; Feels better to know I am getting closer. It sure sounds a lot better
&gt; now that the exhaust manifold is bolted up properly.

neighbors appreciate that too

good luck
Bob

btw, is this engine in the auto or the westfakia???
