Subject: Refacing/reusing lifters

List,
Looked around in the archives for something like this and didn't find it.

Wilson says &quot;If you are using the old lifters they *must* go back in the
original bores.&quot;

Well, why?
Lets say you send your original lifters off and have them refaced - a new
radius put on the surface that interfaces with your reground VW cam. Is this
still the 'original lifter' as wilson says?  Is the cam/lifter relationship
the reason that he says to put them back where they came from or is there
something about the relationship between the lifter and the bore?

If there is some sort of lifter/case realtionship that needs to be maintained,
couldn't you just polish the lifter (like a crank gets polished for new
bearings or a cylinder gets honed for new rings) so the lifter will wear a
'new' surface into the lifter bore?

Any info appreciated except for &quot;buy new lifters and cam&quot;.

thanks,
clark in ky
