Subject: Re: [T2] Catalytic Converter

 
--You said it best about your 79 federal bus...


&gt;Looking at the specs, however, it looks like the stock crossover &gt;pipe/Cat/muffler setup is the way to go, but it's VERY expensive.


72-74 never had provisions for catalytic converters. Hit the junkyards, start mopping floors at Bustedbus.
