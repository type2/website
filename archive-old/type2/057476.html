 Friends,
Here is the info for this year's Transporterfest. Hope to see everyone
there, if not before. I'll be out on the Cape the last week of August
camping with the family. I'm planning to go to Woodstock, NY show Sept.
12-13 and Buses by the Buoy Sept. 18-20.

Tranporterfest, the annual LiMBO/NEATO event at the Museum of
Transportation (Larz Anderson park) in Brookline, MA is happening on
Sunday September 27, 1998. Last year we had over 70 buses on the beautiful
lawn at the M.o.T. Dont miss it this year as we shoot for 100 buses! Call
the museum at (617) 522-6547 or e-mail stanagon_at_world.std_dot_com for
directions.

In addition to all the fun on Sunday we will be having a campout at
Crystal Springs campground in Bolton, MA on Saturday night. Take exit 27
off I-495, go west on 117 for 2 miles, campground is on the right. Call
(978)779-2711 for a reservation, mention LiMBO for group location.
$21/night for water/elec. site.

Feel free to spread the word.
