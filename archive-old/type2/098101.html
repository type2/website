&gt; Hi Craig,
&gt;
&gt;     About a hundred years ago at the dealer, we had an old slow cooker in
&gt; the &quot;unit room&quot; with oil in it, set on high. We just left it on all the time
&gt; (which I would never do at our shop), when we took a crank apart we just
&gt; dropped the gears in the oil, and they were ready to go when we were.

An excellent substitute for this is an electric deep fryer, available at
garage sales everywhere.  They heat up relatively fast, are made to
contain oil (though you don't want to leave them unattended) and have nice
baskets to hold the parts.

One nice thing to have is a set of lab-style insultated gloves.  Much more
secure than trying to manipulate the item with tongs.

George
