Following is from my Mom. Looks like there IS justitce...

;-)
 
Thanks for all the suggestions and help folks. The bus *does* run, it's 
just not registered and needs a head. But, it will back down the driveway 
and back up, so we're clear...

Hi!
Well, I finally talked to the ossifer this morning.  He basically agrees 
with 
you.  I talked to his sgt first, who got Mr. Cop to call me personally at 
work within 3 minutes!

Anyway, as it turns out, my first suspicions were correct.  There was NOT 
a 
discrepancy in the paperwork.  Mr. Cop was called out by a neighbor.  Mr. 
Cop 
 doesn't like these nuisance things.  Mr. Cop was out there on the 14th, 
just 
like the notice said.

So why didn't I notice the notice until the 23rd?  Because it wasn't 
there.  
Nasty Neighbor, whoever it is (BY&amp;M, I think it's the yuppie psychologist 
who 
doesn't even live next door anymore -- his young ex-wife and teen son 
still 
do) filched the notice and put it back on when he thought it would be too 
late for me to do anything about it.  The notice was no way weatherbeaten 
enuff, or leaf &amp; seed strewn to have been there all that time.  To say 
nothing of the fact that I would have noticed it.

Cop won't come right out and admit that he agrees with me, but......he's 
given me WAY more time to comply than originally stated.  He also said, 
&quot;Charge up your battery and practice a bit.  Then call me out and back it 
out 
into the street and back into your driveway.  If it dies, I can't help 
you.  
So practice.&quot;

I still want to get it in the garage eventually, but this is kind of a 
neat 
way to tweak Nasty Neighbor back, with the cops' blessing.  If he files 
again, we can just do the move it in &amp; out of the driveway gig again, and 
he 
can keep hurting his eyes on my eyesore.

Thanx for all your help in the matter.

Love'n'stuff
Mom
