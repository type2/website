Subject: Dual Battery Charge System Question
Mime-Version: 1.0

Installed the POR 15 treated tank back into Casper yesterday, as well as a 
new starter, new voltage regulator, remote relay start system, and the 
relay style dual charge circuit.

OK, Question.........
So that the dual battery charge relay closes ONLY under normal engine 
operation, I am thinking to just obtain the relay (coil)  voltage from off 
of the engine ignition coil where it is fed it's 12 VDC under normal engine 
operation.

Does this make sense to others who have gone down this road, just as it 
makes sense to me, or am I missing something in my logic thought?

Anyone out there come up with what they might think is a better &quot;only when 
engine running&quot; 12 VDC source?
