Subject: RE: [T2] Engine Rebuild problems

&gt;From: Rus &lt;rusb01_at_yahoo_dot_com&gt;

&gt;HEY GUYS i need some help..........i did my first
&gt;engine rebuild and everything seemed to go together
&gt;great...it all went together good and fit good and
&gt;turned over on the stand great.............then but it
&gt;in the car and tried to turn it over........it was
&gt;pretty tight so  i pulled it around in third and got
&gt;it started........ran pretty good for just a few
&gt;minutes.....but kept dying....the timing is probably
&gt;not set right but while doing so it just all the
&gt;sudden wont turn over anymore.?
&gt;like it siezed  up.......it has plenty of
&gt;oil................what in the world could i
&gt;have done to it? would it have gotten hot and just
&gt;with all the new parts expanded and now just wont turn
&gt;  over til cooled?


What was your endplay like?
What type of rebuild was it top and bottom?
What year bus what type of engine?
Need more info, but if you had to pull it around to get it started, 
something doesn't sound right.
