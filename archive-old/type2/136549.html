Subject: [T2] propane fridge

&gt; Hi,
&gt; I heard somewhere that some of the vanagons had
&gt; fridges that run off of 12v 
&gt; or propane.  I was wondering if it is 12v or propane
&gt; OR 12v and propane.  
&gt; Basically, can I set one up by my lake without
&gt; having to have a battery that 
&gt; I will have to recharge or electricity?
&gt; Thanks,
&gt; Kyle
&gt; 
    
Make: Domenic.  Model RM2193.  Costs about $440 from
places like www_dot_campingworld_dot_com.  But you will also
want to purchase a woodgrained door panel, sold
separately.  Shipping for the Reefer is steep, at
about $50, but then the item is heavy and large.  No
ice maker, light, or door shelves, but still more than
adequate for food refridgeration.  Requires a special
shaped cabinet hole.  My Riviera Plan 1 has one.  Love
it.  Replaced the original Reefer with only a couple
of cabinet modifications.  Yes, 12v, 120v, and
propane.  But set at 12v, it pulls 9-10 amps, which
can quickly drain the main battery.  If to be used on
12v, be sure to use a big Aux battery to drive it.  In
my opinion.  Also, Propane usage when parked only.
   
12v, or 120v, or propane.
