Subject: Just put on a high quality Empi muffler (hahaha)

&gt; When it arrived it came with a semi-gloss black finish. Now look:

When I got mine, I was told it is supposed to change from black to white, 
and that since mine didn't change totally (like yours), it is because I was 
running too rich, and the exhaust didn't get hot enough to finish curing it 
from black to white.
