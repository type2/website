Subject: 6 weeks and counting to the True Canadian Winter Bus Campout

Hi Volks,

It's been  mild winter in the Northeast.... The tundra around Toronto  
still hasn't frozen over!  Regardless, the TCWBC will still be going  
on as usual on the weekend of February 18th.

TCWBC is a one-night campout near Hamilton, Ontario Canada; keeping  
you comfortable with serviced sites and flush toilets &amp; showers  
located conveniently nearby. There will be a group dinner, a campfire  
and Breakfast Burritos in the morning.

If you're within driving distance of Toronto and your camping habit  
needs a fix sooner rather than later, consider checking out the TCWBC.

Visit the website for more details:

Happy Trails,

P.S. You still don't need a passport to drive across the border if  
you're a Canadian or U.S. Citizen. State-issued Photo ID with a Birth  
Certificate will be accepted. Passport requirements are for air  
travel only at this time.
