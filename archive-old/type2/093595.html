Subject: Re: [T2] my $100 paint job

That looks great!

I managed to do mine for about $50:

http://scrounge.bradway_dot_net/gallery/album01

It was that powdery off-white. Now it's red, white and blue!

If I had to do it over again I would have taken more time and used three
light coats (I used Rustoleum Pro) and gave each coat about four hours
to dry. I ended up doing more to the interior than I expected. The
floorboard under the plywood was badly rusted under the cooler ('74
interior, cooler is behind the passenger seat) and under the sink.
There's still some rust along the driver's side wall. I would have had
to pull the interior panels to get to it. But it's much better than it
was!

I also replaced the carpet for about $30. I used the old carpet as
templates and even carpeted the front seat pedastels.
