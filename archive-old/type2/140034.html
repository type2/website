Subject: Re: [T2] Satellite Radio and iPod install ?

I just installed an Alpine unit bought from Crutchfields and an extra
Alpine device that lets you control the iPod from the head unit. I
installed it about one month ago. I just found a small space behind
the head unit and attached the extra device with some velcro and
pulled the included iPod cable forward.

I'm glad I bought it. I took a drive from the SF Bay to Los Angeles
with it and the drive along snoozeville I5 was a lot more fun. I had a
huge selection of music to choose from without flipping tapes or CDs.
It took me a while to figure out the searching interface, and you do
have to keep glancing at the head unit to see what you're playing, but
it works. There's even a randomizer to assure great variety.

Good luck.
