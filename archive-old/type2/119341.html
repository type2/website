&lt;&lt; Anyone know where you can get 195R14 tires?
I saw some on a guy's bus at EveryBus a few years ago, and I want some.  I 
think they were load range D.  And it just so happens that I will be needing 
tires before too long.

It's ten o'clock, do you know what the expiration date on your tire is... ?-(
