Subject: Re: [T2] Cantrell's tome on aux battery and relay

Wire gauge size as referred to has nothing to do with the charging level 
from the alternator (unless you have two dead batteries)  The charged 
battery will act as a buffer.  Wiring patterns for dual battery setups 
is determined by the use of the dual batteries.  In circuits where 
&quot;jumping&quot; is one of the features then 2 or 4 gauge wire is listed.  This 
type is common in off roading vehicles.   Anther use of the heavy wiring 
is if the batteries are dualed to provide high current for things like 
winches.   If jumping is not one of the features then 10 guage (which is 
30~40 amp rated in auto, add two and you get 60~80, the wiring usually 
found on bosch alternators)   If you use the technique of trickle 
charging from another battery (battery balancing) usually nothing more 
than 12 gauge is needed unless one battery is stone dead.  In normal 
vehicle &quot;non-jumping&quot; setups the load is divided.  i.e. normal run of 
vehicle from one battery, and coolers, tunes, etc drawing from the 
other.  This means that the actual current passing from battery to 
battery is usually no more than balancing current.  This means 10 gauge 
is adequate.  in this setup you could  use the 15 amp relay but i would 
use a 30 amp just to increase reliability (not current capability)  In 
VW documentation if find nothing showing that VW ever intended that the 
aux be used to jump the start batt.  Which can be done in the newer 
winnebago variations of the VW.

&gt; I guess I should chime in here a bit.
&gt; Please remember that even when the main batt is to
&gt; drained to start it, it still has lots of power
&gt; remaining.  The voltage is too low to make sufficent
&gt; RPMS to start, but I can tell you from experience that
&gt; if you mistakenly short out a car battery in this
&gt; state, you are taking your life in your hands.
&gt; Personnaly, Ive started by 78 westy by just connecting
&gt; the two lug terminals on the relay together.
&gt; The trick is (even with a stone dead main battery) to
&gt; let the charge flow for several minutes without the key
&gt; in the ignition.  The main battery will suck up the
&gt; charge of the AUX at what ever rate it can through the
&gt; small wire and piddly connections until the voltage is
&gt; equalized.  Leave the connection in place while
&gt; starting and recharging (that what it does anyway once
&gt; it starts)
