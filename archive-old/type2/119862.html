&gt; Sorry to repost.  Spent some time trouble shooting this morning.  It
&gt; appears as thought the fuel relay may be bad.  After following the
&gt; procedure in Bently, we could not get any parts of the relay to test
&gt; positive using the ground from terminal 85 but they tested just fine
&gt; when grounding to the body.  Anyone else experience a ground in the fuel
&gt; relay going bad?  Just throwing some feelers out there before I sing
&gt; $65-95 into a new relay.

Please read the previous post to Mr. Williams.  I believe you may have a
problem with the ground connections to the double relay or in the FI
harness located under the air distribution box.

                             OOK!
