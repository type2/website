&gt;  howdy tim,
&gt;  you said:
&gt;  'Brake lock up is caused most by unmaintained calipers, then by
&gt;unmaintained hoses, then by unmaintained master cylinders'....
&gt;  is there  maintenance other than the 'flushing and renewel of fluid
&gt;periodically' that you mention?? thanks.


sticky calipers should have the rust removed from the pistons, and replace
seals, same with the master or get a new one, hoses get replaced new...
and so when you do this work, get new steel lines.....
it's been thirty years, and you deserve some brakes today...
