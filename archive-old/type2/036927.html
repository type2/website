Subject: What I accomplished today :-)

Well, I think I had a pretty productive day. Someone suggested I share a
bit more about my ride, so it's a 1970 station wagon with a later, AS
block 1600 dp. Here's what I got done today:

1) Valve Adjustment
	Easier than I expected. Cool! :-)

2) Points
	My setup didn't jive with Muir's description, but it looks
	like its OK anyway.

3) Timing
	Tried this with the static method in Muir, doesn't seem to 
	run as well :-( Several list members wrote to suggest using 
	the Bentley book and a strobe. I'm already waiting on a copy
	of the book - can't speed up UPS :-) I'll hit Sears for the
	strobe. BTW, I posted earlier that it would not run at idle,
	but it seems to have gotten better on its own :-)

4) Oil Change
	A little messier than my other vehicles :-) Had to replace the
	screen, it was broken. Other than that, pretty smooth. The oil
	was pretty gross, so I'll do it again in much less than 3K miles.

5) Compression Check
	1: 85 pounds
	2: 105 pounds
	3: 97 pounds
	4: 100 pounds

	I didn't have an oil can, so I was unable to check #1 and see 
	if I was looking at rings or valves :-( I picked a can up this evening, 
	and will check again after Pomona tomorrow.

I still need to take care of brakes, but I'm leaning towards just
replacing everything - I'll see what that'll cost me tomorrow at Pomona.
Hope its dry :-)
