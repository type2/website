Subject: Re: [T2] bus accident

The top edge of the dash board looks fine, seems the windshield
and dash weren't damaged.

I'm going to try and line up a day and time this week to get
my bus into a local VW shop to see if they can estimate the
repair costs. I've started figuring the parts cost with some
online shopping as you suggested. This is good and will give
me an better idea of the parts cost before I bring it to a body
shop.

And nope the accident wasn't cause by snow or ice on the
road. The other vehicle pulled out in front of me, she was
trying to merge into traffic going the opposite direction of
me. This was a two lane road and the accident happened in a
curved segment of it. I don't think she had looked my
direction before pulling out to cross my lane of traffic...
She was driving a T*yota 4 runner, and I struck her on the
drivers side between front and rear door.

&gt; Take the Bus to a body shop of your choosing and get an estimate---on
&gt; your own.
