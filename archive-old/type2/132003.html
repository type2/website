Subject: Front shift rod bushing

Hi all,
A few years ago (about 10-15k miles) I replaced my front shift rod bushing.
When I was under the bus today I noticed that there was a *lot* of side to
side play in it, as in the whole bush moves but is tight on the rod.
Probably 1/8&quot; altogether.  Do they often wear out this quick, or could
something else be amiss?  The bush is just located in a hole in a bracket
that is welded together and it looks fine to me.
