Subject: [T2] Rebuilt DID start!!!!!YES!!!

I switched the spark plug wires around 180degrees and it worked, but
why? did the engine builder mess up? anyway I started it up and
preceeded to run the engine at 2200rpm
for the specified 20 min and it ran pretty well and loud for 15 min then
te accelerator cable popped out and it revved real high(4300rpm) and
then died.  Is 15 min enough? I had to quit running the car because the
car that was jumpstarting my car had to leave(I need a new battery)
should I start it up later and run it another 20 min? any responses will
be appreciated. thanks, Brian running 71 westy
