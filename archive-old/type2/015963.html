Well, I bought the westy. Recall that this was the '77 (I may
have initially described it as a '78) that didn't run but the
seller swore it only needed the carb (PO converted from FI) put on to run. 
Completely rebuilt with new pistons, heads, cylinders, cam, bearings, etc.
Interior complete and really nice, all electrics work (from what I can tell)
I got great advice from y'all and in the end offered him $1200 (from his
$1600, which was originally $3000).  He had it towed to his garage and
deal was done. Then I sweated until I heard from the garage.
Final verdict- need to put on the carb, seal the manifold, and adjust 
the timing=$80. PHEW!  I was fearing the worst.  Now she's running
beautifully.  

I also got great advice re. insurance. I went with Geico. Minimum
Missouri coverage would have been $330/year. I bumped it up a lot
for $400/year.

Next step is getting it inspected. PO put strait pipes on it with 
glasspack mufflers. Loud! We'll find out tomorrow.

Finally, can anybody comment on price of new cv boots?
One place wants hour labor/side or ~$125 total. Other
place wants ~$240 total!

Thanks again for all your info.

Patrick
