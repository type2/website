Subject: Pop Top Drama!

Hello all!

I was on the list about 2 years ago.  I went traveling around the country in 
my 71 westy Rainbow.  I have finally settled in Portland, OR and am back 
online and back to the list.

So now,  My pop top is flying up on windy days.  But that is pretty normal 
but it is actually making metal jarring sounds and broke the pop top handles 
(crappy black rubber ones) during one of my trips throught the windy 
Columbia River Gorge.  So I put the makeshift metal handles back onto the 
bus that the previous owner had on there.  Stock is nice but not always 
better.  I haven't driven him since  this was done.

What have you all done with your poptops?  Does this happen to everyone.  I 
am tired of hanging out in the back trying to use my body weight from the 
pop top handle to hold the damn thing down.

Thanks!

Nothin left to do but smile, smile, smile!!
