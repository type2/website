&gt; I also have a vacuum control that takes the very small vacuum line.  It 
&gt;is missing and I cannot see where it should come from and why it exists. 

I think I remember that fitting on the air distribution box. Doesn't it come
out around 
the area of the 3/4 intakes? If I remember correctly, it should go to a
plastic &quot;T&quot; fitting, the other two ends of the &quot;T&quot; fitting go to fuel pressure
regulator - the brass canister screwed through the left front tin. the last
end goes to the distributor biscuit. I'm not sure but someone will probably
know better.
