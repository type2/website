Subject: Re: [T2] Busses and Ham Radio

I used to work CW almost exclusively until I got involved in a couple of 80m nets and became just another rag-chewer!  But I still love it.  I've got to get the antenna back up.  Just don't like climbing trees anymore. Something about disability!  Actually, a friend of mine is paralyzed from the neck down because of it.  Broken limb changed his life.  I think I'm going to hire somebody to do it.  I've got a great Carolina Windom.  One of the best antenna's I've ever used.  But the one of the trees came down last fall.  Or maybe the year before.  How time flies.  I still use my old Kenwood TS-430S for my base rig.  The audio is much warmer than the 706.  And it's much easier to use. I can't tell that the receiver in the 706 is any better than the old Kenwood.  Better filtering but I've learned all of the tricks.  Good ears beat good filters.  Maybe we should set up the Breadbox Net.  Cheers...KR

CW only!  That's the true VW philosophy!
