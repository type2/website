Subject: Re: [T2] engine install question

well.  after many helpful responses and a couple of additional unsuccessful
attempts at installing the engine I have concluded that I likely bent the
lower bellhousing studs at some point in the process (Thanks Chris for
pointing that possibility out).  So...I searched the archives and couldn't
seem to find a previous post that mentioned the size of the studs and
perhaps where I might find replacements...  any ideas/suggestions?? by the
way its a '76 Westy.

thanks for the help...

Also make sure you didn't let the engine droop thereby bending the lower
bellhousing studs (on the engine). I did this with a Beetle 40 HP and spent

a whole afternoon trying to figure this problem out.
