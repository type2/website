Who has gone through the trials and tribulations of mounting an FM-AM-CD
Player combo into a 69-70 series bus that does not easily accommodate the
DIN dimension support cage device that secures the player unit?

Did you have to whittle on the radio mounting cavity or did you wind up
with a unit mounted &quot;above&quot; the recessed cavity and onto the dash, itself?

Looks like an AM-FM radio will go in fine, but if you want a CD player in
the bus, you have some dimensional fit problems with the factory stock
cutout dimension vs. that which is required by the current feature rich
stereo units out there in market land.

Comments from those that have been there??
