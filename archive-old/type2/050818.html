There's a dark blue '71 VW bus with a '60s model Mercedes-Benz sedan's
grille mounted on the front clip.  I've seen it in Newport.  It's some
clever person's way of personalizing their VW, and they did a fine job.
(No, they don't come from the factory that way.  :-)

The MB grille looks much better than the ubiquitous spare tire.
