Subject: Westy Interiors

Speaking of interiors...
Is there any resource that lays out by year &amp; model (say Westy VS Riveria)
the different layouts?
My current VDub is a 78' Westy... but like others mentioned, I had a '73
Riveria rust free bus that I mistakenly sold some years ago when moving and
short on cash... sniff sniff...

I really liked the layout of the riv.  The dresser was behind the driver
giving it more vertical storage and a much larger bed. It had dual Webbers
so the power was at least as good as the '78 FI.   The simpler non-FI motor
was much easier to tweek.   No silly emission testing in S. Dakota... ;`).
The &quot;turtle top&quot; was cool too...
