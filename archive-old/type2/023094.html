&gt;It occurred to me that an ideal product to cure the problem would be
&gt;a substance that would (a) reduce (in the oxidation removal sense)
&gt;corrosion, inhibit corrosion, and be conductive in itself.

Penetrox, by Burndy
Available at electrical supply houses.

Penetrox is not actually considered to be &quot;conductive&quot; by itself, to the 
best of my knowledge, but it is used for the sole purpose of preventing 
oxidation from destroying the electrical conductivity of tubing junctures 
and mechanical connections that must remain conductive.

I put it on all of my automotive battery posts, engine compartment spade 
lugs and connectors, and on all of my aluminum antenna elements used in my 
amateur radio installation.

Been using it for over 30 years and it works great !!
