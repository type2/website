Subject: Re: Vanagon List Meet/Campout Version 1.?

I could just see the KOA field at Devils Tower filled with Vanagons, 
and that's only 100 miles from Rapid City SD... I liked Devils Tower 
in WY, it's one of those places I'd be happy to make the trip to 
again and that's 1100+ miles.

&gt;Maybe I'm biased a bit based on my location, but I agree a centrally

&gt;be the ideal spot.  It is absolutely beautiful and there are plenty 
&gt;of sights to see.  If tens of thousands of Harleys can make it in 
&gt;August, a few busses should be able to make it in June.
