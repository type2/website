Ladies and Gentlemen,

Among the cleanup tasks that I have still not accomplished is that when
you sign up, you are supposed to get, along with the &quot;you are on&quot;
meassage, a copy of the charter of the list.  I am afraid that I dropped
that task in the triage of getting the digest up and certain other errors
corrected.  If you have been on for a while, then you did get it, but in
the two recent switches, many of you signed on and did not.

Whether you signed on a week ago or two years ago, please read or re-read
the attached copy of the charter.  It's important. Save it.  

                           Thanks you, all of you,
                           H Steven Dolan
                           Alexandria, VA

charter.txt
==========================================================================
This document is the charter of the type2 list. Please read it all the
way through--it's important.

If you don't have an aircooled bus built after 1968, you're on the wrong
list. Busses built between 1950 and 1967 (split windshield busses) are
handled by the vintage bus list, vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com. Watercooled buses,
built after 1982, are handled by the vanagon list. If this is you,
unsubscribe from this list and then point your web browser here:

        http://www.vanagon_dot_com/

Okay. Type2 is about being in buses on the road, keeping buses on the
road, and rescuing forlorn or neglected buses and putting them back on
the road. Mainly, it's a technical/mechanical resource, although we also
welcome trip reports, for sale advertisements, and &quot;here's what I fixed
today&quot; messages.
                                                               
This list IS NOT A CHAT SESSION, and if you treat it as one your
subscription will be cancelled. Before you post a message please make
sure that it has legitimate bus content. This is enforced.  

&quot;Legitimate&quot; means that there is a good reason that 800 other people
should spend their time reading your message. &quot;Bus&quot; means not-Beetle,
not-Ghia, not anything but aircooled Transporters. There are other lists
for other models. General mechanical/technical/shop stuff is fine if it
applies to somebody's Transporter problem.

If you have never been on a mailing list before, you should consult the
newbie material on the web site, particularly at:

        http://www.type2_dot_com/list.html

This really --no kidding-- applies to those of you who signed on by way
of America On Line and/or who think it would be a good idea to post a
message in ALL CAPS.
                                  
This is a high-volume list. You can expect 30 to 100 messages per day. If
you aren't prepared to deal with this kind of mail volume, a smart
alternative is to read the list from its archive on the web
when you have time:

       http://www.findmail_dot_com/list/type2/

Normally non-subscribers cannot post to the list, but if you want to
unsubscribe from the email list and read from the web page while still
being able to post messages to the list, it is trivial to add you to the
&quot;approved&quot; file; consult Steve Dolan &lt;dworkin_at_type2_dot_com&gt;.

This list only accepts submissions in plain vanilla 7-bit US-ASCII text.
The list server will intercept and return to its author any message
whose content type is &quot;multipart&quot;, which means that if you write mail
in a web browser or in most any Microsoft product you might have to
make some adjustments. It's no fun, but you might have to consult       
the documentation that came with your mail program. Avoiding MIME-
encapsulated messages is the only way to ensure that everybody on
the list can view your message.

If you don't know what 7-bits, eighty columns means, please send mail to
the admin &lt;dworkin_at_type2_dot_com&gt; so he can explain it to you.

The type2_dot_com home page is, predictably, here:

   http://www.type2_dot_com/

The home page is considered to be part of the list and there is a
tremendous amount of information there that can help you; you are
encouraged to explore it. In particular, though, familiarize yourself
with the Library and Archive pages.
                                              
The Library  page gives you easy access to all known bus archives,
along with search engines and a carefully thought-out search procedure
designed to get you the most possible useful information in return for
the least possible effort.

The Archive page gives you access to every post to the type2 mailing
list, with the ability to serch by any word in the subject line or the
body of the post.

You are expected to run a search thru the Archives and to have looked in
th Library before posting questions to the list. This is to your
advantage: you have hundreds of megs of hardcore answers to your questions
and the search tools to pull out the information you need.  You'll get
more answers faster from the search engines than you will if you ask the
list to spoon-feed you. Please use this resource early and often.

When replying to list messages, please quote only for context. Do not
quote entire messages. Do not quote other people's signature files. Cut
quotes to the bone. We already read it once. This ain't usenet.

FRIDAY. TGIF is an institution that started on v_at_l, our motherlist. It's
a release, it's a morale-builder, it's when the content restrictions get
loose. Understand that Friday ends at midnight on that day, it does not
endure indefinitely. And, even on Friday, messages must have bus content.

There are some subjects that are only appropriate on Friday. These
include toys, models, memorabilia, sightings, and surveys. Surveys are
those threads that seek everybody's subjective opinion. Sightings are
messages about buses spotted in movies and television shows and
commercials. Please do not post messages on these subjects on any other
day. Newbies are encouraged to get the feel of it first; there's a line,
and the veterans know where it is.

Here are the &quot;do not evers&quot;. If you do these things you will probably get
booted: 
                            
 --do not ever post &quot;test&quot; messages. (e-mail the administrator,
                                      dworkin_at_type2_dot_com or
                                      dworkin_at_ari_dot_net instead!)
 --do not ever post server commands to the list.
 --do not try to post binaries to the list.
 --do not continue a thread after the admin has asked that it be killed.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

LEGAL STUFF:

1. This is not a moderated list. The administrator doesn't see the
messages until you do, maybe later than you do, and because of the nature
of this medium the administrator has no way of retracting messages from
public view. Propogation is automatic; once you send a message, it's
gonna go, and there's no way of stopping it.   

2. Since that is true, the administrator cannot control what is posted to
this list, and therefore disclaims any responsibility for the messages
the list server propogates. If you post a message, you alone are
responsible for it. If you don't like that, don't post messages.

3. By United States copyright law, messages posted to this list are
copyrighted with all rights reserved by their respective authors. The
administrator of this list makes no claim to ownership of your messages and
will not republish or sell them, and neither should anybody else.

However, cross-posting is common on the Net whether it is authorized or
not, and if you post a message to this list it will automatically be
entered into at least two publicly accessible archives, where it will
remain permanently. If you don't like the possibility of your words being
cross-posted or archived, then don't post messages.
