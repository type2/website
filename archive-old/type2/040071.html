Subject: Just Picked up a 68 need parts ?

I'll be removing parts off of this complete bus, less engine, anybody need
any parts brought to Sacramento Bug-O-Rama? It has a good middle seat (Tan)
good transaxle, all doors and hatches good. It also has fairly new tires on
the darn thing, rear engine splash pan/access cover, front beam for those of
you who want to raise the front of your splitty 1.5 inches. I haven't gotten
to the front seats with all of junk in it but everything that can come off
will be taken to Sacramento next weekend. Anybody on the list gets first
pick, I'll be in the white 68 Double Cab for sale in the swap area on
Saturday night and Sunday.
Britt
