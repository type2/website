Subject: Re: [T2] paint jobs

&gt; &quot;Wet sanding&quot;...Paint the bus/car, then wet sand (a waterproof paper
&gt; with progresively finer grit is used). The paper is kept wet inder a fine
&gt; mist to wash away the sanded paint. Dry the vehicle and paint it again.
&gt; Keep repeating with finer and finer grits...It's the way cars were done
&gt; in the twenties and thirties...Coachbuilt cars, at least...

I had heard that you could also have two coats put on initially and then wet
sand. Also, I seem to recall that you couldn't use just any kind of paint. I
guess it had to be a type of paint that carried the pigments consistently
throughout the paint layer. What do you think?
