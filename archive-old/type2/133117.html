Subject: RE: [T2] Rear/side window installation

Chris,

When I did my 78 Champagne edition, all of my glass to body seals came 
from west coast.  All of them but one went back in beautifully...except 
for the window from hell.

Drivers side middle window with 50/50 sliders....I finally realized that 
the 

window opening was ****too small****  !!!!

Yes, the window came out of there.  I burned 3 seals trying to get it to 
fit until I actually measured it against the window with the seal on it.

At *least* 1/4&quot; to 3/8&quot; too small of an opening vertically!  I bit the 
bullet, got out my air nibler, wrapped it carefully in a soft cloth(bus 
was already painted) and nibbled away.

The next try was a winner!  The glass went in, but not very easily and I 
didn't tear the seal.

My only conclusion was that maybe the factory made the opening too small, 
and might have had some sort of special seal for it.  I couldn't measure 
the others as they were already in and done.

Obviously, YMMV, not so obviously, really look everything over again...

Cheers, dave

&gt; I was Paul's helper last night. Has anyone noticed that West Coast Metric's rubber is softer than the cheaper rubber from Bus Depot? Is this a good thing - beyond the fact the softer seal was easier to me to install. 
&gt; 
&gt; My wife and I installed all of our windows without hitch but Paul's were a bear. I think the stirng might have been too small diameter and it seemed that the grooves in his rubber that the body lip seated in was too shallow to hold the string (as compared to the seals from West Coast Metric). 
&gt; 
&gt; I got really frustrated and want to get this glass installed and right..
