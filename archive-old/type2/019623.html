ok.  First of all, someone suggested a piece of hose from a marine store.
This is only useable for the rubber hose that connects the filler neck to the
gas tank.  What you're looking for is the fuel filler neck elbow, that
connects the top of the filler neck to the body.  This is part # 211 201
119.  A while back, bus depot said they had ten of them.  They are in great
demand, and most likely they are sold out.  The other place (the only place)
to get these is a place in Australia called brookvale spares.  If you do a
yahoo search for that name, you get their address and email.

    Of course, brookvale is out of them, too.  I've gotten half my order, and
am waiting for the next shipment, which I've been told IS coming.

    In the meantime, only fill the tank half way.  This won't really
eliminate the smell, but it will eliminate the large amount of gas dumping on
the ground when you turn.

    Search for Fuel Filler Neck, and Fuel filler elbow in the archives for
way way more info, including a page with pictures of the part.
