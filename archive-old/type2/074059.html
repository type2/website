Subject: What part is =?iso-8859-1?q?it=3F?=

Could someone please tell me what the second round plate underneath
the type IV engine is?  I know the one is the oil strainer but what is
the second one?  It has two bolts that I believe is holding it on.  I
have oil leaking from this area and would like to replace the gasket
(I am assuming there is a gasket there).  Any and all help is
appreciated.  I looked in my manual but Haynes doesn't show a picture
of this or tell what it is.  
Thanks,
Kevin
