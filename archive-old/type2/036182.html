Subject: Re: Why not jar cylinders loose?

Once the cylinders are pulled away from the case, they will leak oil at the
case. The seal that the paper gasket and/or shelac had will be broken and
they will leak. At least that's the idea.

I have seen them leak mildly from this...and I've seen them leak profusely
from this.

Good luck! Joe
