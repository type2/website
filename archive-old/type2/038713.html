Some rubbing/polishing compound and some elbow grease. Get the point &amp;
chrome.

Murphy's Oil soap (Armor-All, etal..). Get all the stuff it's made for.

Lemon oil - for the wood in the bus...

Wash &amp; Wax the floor, if applicable.

Of course, a heart-shaped pillow tied to the bumper.

Don't do tooo good of a job. After all, he's *only* going out to sea for a
year - he might not notice *you* if the bus is too cherry lookin'!

Subject: presents?


&gt; I bought my husband a VW Bus for a very early Christmas present, and he
wants
&gt; to fix it up.  I am looking for suggestions on reasonably priced ways to
fix
&gt; it up.  We want to fully restore it.  It's a 1974, with an automatic
&gt; transmission.  My husband is in the military, and he's getting out in two
&gt; years.  In a year, he has to go out to sea for a year, and then he gets
out.
&gt; I want to surprise him with it when he comes home.  Suggestions?
&gt;
