Subject: water???  carb to manifold

greetings.
I have a 74 Westy with 2.0L motor.  Ignition is compu-fire, 009 Dizzy 
(blah) and carbs are dual 35mm Solex.  Bus runs decent, fuel economy 
seems low (14mpg highway).  Timing correct, valves adjusted correcly.  
Took VW to Eureka Springs last weekend.  Seems little low on power 
towards top end, especially 4th gear. Stopped to fill up and peek at 
motor.  I noticed water dripping down the oe cast intake manifolds from 
base of carburetors.  Entire top of Intake was wet.  Is this normal?  
Recently went from weber progressive to this carburetor and ignition 
set up.  Water on an air-cooled? :).
thanks in advance.

David Parisi
74 Westy, ready to camp!
