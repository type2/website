Subject: RE: [T2] Rear License Plate Bracket

The reason I ask is since I was hit in the engine lid is a parking lot, I
had to get a new lid.  My current engine lid has two holes near the center,
maybe 2 inches apart; the plate is attached with a bracket.

The replacement lid, from BustedBus, has holes far apart - license plate
size.

Eric asked:


Are there different rear license plate brackets for different years?

And Dan replied:
 
 i recall there being differences in california and non-california buses. 
 not sure about differences throughout the years though.

I do not find any VW part number for any license brake bracket. Even Bus
Depot does not show one for a bus.

I believe the dealer installed whatever they found as a 'local purchase'.
