Subject: Re: [T2] oil temp?

 &gt;Don't mess with the VDO guages. I've never gotten mine to work 
properly with either a dipstick sender or
 &gt;a sender in the taco plate. A good head temp guage is next on my list.

FWIW my VDO gauges work fine and I'm sure they do for many others.  they 
ARE sensitive to the wiring and grounding. . .some folks report common 
calibration issues and bad apples but I have a 3-gauge pod mounted below 
my dash to the left of the steering wheel with cyl. head temp, oil 
pressure, and oil temp (now on the CB adapter for oil pressure/temp both 
in pressure location fot T1).  and all the readings make sense.  YMMV.
