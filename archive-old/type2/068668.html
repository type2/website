Barndoor Parts........Funny, VERY Funny

Remember Tom, he who laughs last, laughs the best.  Be careful of what you
wish for, it may come true and come back to bite you.

BTW, I haven't forgotten about the steel post Safari Latches for the BBI
style (or the other guy's [UGH] style safaris.  We're gonna be gearing up to
do these late this fall AFTER the re-tooling to make the rest of the
assemblies in Stainless Steel (Polished or Powder-Coat White) during this
winter.

Saw your recent post concerning &quot;the other guys&quot;.  Sent a copy over to our
guys in the shop.  Got a real kick out of it.  We've got a set of their
safaris (sans glass) in our &quot;Masters&quot; cabinet with a note attached - &quot;How not
to do these&quot; :-) .  What you posted is what we hear several times a week from
those experiencing the same.  They've got a write-up on these and the
installation in the Sept Hot VWs.   Too bad they don't mention these and
other problem's we've heard about.

What's a &quot;Masters&quot; cabinet?  We have both a Final Prototype Master and a
Production Master of each item we make in our shop stowed away in various
cabinets.  When we do a production run of an item, we pull the Masters of
that item to compare and insure that the production MATCHES exactly those
Masters.
