Subject: SLOW OIL PRESSURE BUILD-UP

Hey gang,

I have a problem and would really like some of your sage wisdom:

After installing my shiny rebuilt 2.0 hydraulic lifter AVP engine in my 79
bus a couple months ago, I noticed that the oil pressure takes a really long
time to build up when I start it up.  On a cool day, it takes a good 30
seconds before the oil warning lite goes off and on a cold day, it takes
about 45 seconds.  During this 30 to 45 seconds, the engine makes a terrible
racket, but quiets down once the pressure comes up.  When the pressure
eventually comes up, it comes up really fast, like just a couple of seconds.

I have just changed oil (Castrol 20-50) and a new German oil filter and the
problem persists.  Also, I have an oil pressure gage, so I know that the oil
warning lite is working right.

I would really appreciate any advice you can throw my way,
