George, thanks for the scoop.  I spoke to the PO about the motor, and
he had a guy build it for him on the barter system, and he did use Mexican
heads, and also suggested I replace them with whatever came outta there.
 And upon further inspection, they are really not in need of replacement.
 I'll just take 'em back, and keep them for spares.

Thanks for the help,

Simon Ramirez Jr.

The gap spec that you use is the one specified for the vehicle, not

&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; OK, let's see what kind are in the motor now.  They are much longer
&gt; in
&gt; &gt; the threaded area, and gapped much bigger than what the book said.
&gt;  These
&gt; &gt; are Bosch as well, W8DC, and gapped to ~0.065.
&gt; 
&gt; Do you have a Mexican engine or replacement Mexican heads?  If so,
&gt; they
&gt; are designed to take the long-reach plugs.  Original heads were designed
&gt; to take the short reach plugs.  The length of the plug threads should
&gt; match the length of the threads in the hole.  
&gt; 
&gt; A short plug in a long hole
&gt; would shroud the flame front and possibly cause misfires.  A long plug
&gt; in
&gt; a short hole might cause pre-ignition because of the exposed threads
&gt; getting hot.  It might even get in the way of the piston!
