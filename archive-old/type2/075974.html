Subject: Access to Mike Howles' web site (was: ignition lock removal) 

Volks,

It looks like Mike's ISP has been taken over by another ISP.  As a result,
some IP address wierdness is going on.  I can reach some of the pages some
of the time, but not others and it keeps changing.  I figure it will
settle out in a day or two.

The advice and photos Mike is offering are excellent, tho, and well worth
the effort to get them.  I knew how to do this, but have never succeeded
in communicating the info using words (if you get to the page, you will
see why :-)
