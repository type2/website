Subject: Sink Pump Question..Cont't
To: type2_at_type2_dot_com


thanks for all the replys. I think I know where to check the fuse now.
However, when hooking it up. How do I know which wire is ground? I
don't have anything to check to see which one is hot and which one is
not. 
When it comes to electrical stuff..I'm a complete idiot.

On my sink pump it has two wires coming out. One wire says connect to
positive. coming from the bus there are two wires just hanging there.
How would I know what wire to connect to the other wire? I can't
believe I'm having so much trouble with this. I thought it would be
easy.

Thanks for all your help,

Greg
