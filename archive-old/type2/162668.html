&gt; Don,
&gt; 	I wonder how good of a trigger signal it is sending to the injector
&gt; control mod? Perhaps it's enough to trigger the spark, but it's messing
&gt; with the computers ability to properly time and fire the injectors in
&gt; the correct order, or at the correct time?


in a VW all 4 injectors fire at the same time into the intake manifold, so
it doeesn't matter &quot;when&quot; they fire as long as they all fire.  should not
affect idle would affect acceleration and top speed and power if they all
fire..  if one or more is not firing then thaat cyl will not have fuel and
no power
