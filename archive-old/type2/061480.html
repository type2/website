&gt; All this talk about engine fires really scares the hell out of me.

Me too.  I have replaced all fuel lines on my '76 2 litre twin carb camper,
but I still smell fuel after filling and going around a tight corner.  I
suspect a cracked filler tube.  How dangerous is this?  Can the filler tube
be replaced through the round hatch in the engine compartment?  Is there
only rubber at the top or at the bottom of the tube as well?
Also does anyone know if lead in the fuel is dangerous to inhale in these
circumstances (Its only a slight smell occasionally not continuous
eyewatering smog!)

Thanks, Gavin
