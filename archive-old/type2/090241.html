Subject: Re: [T2] rust behind drivers seat

&gt; From a safety perspective, do I need to be concerned about the rusting

Yes.  The stress on the seat belt mounts during an accident is *very*
high.  If they pull out, then you go flying.

&gt; I have examined the seatbelt mounting bracket under the wheelwell and
&gt; it appears to be secure. How does moisture get in behind the seats?

Daniel, VW welded a reinforcing plate behind the sheet metal with a nut
welded into it.  This provides a number of crevices for water and road
crap (especially salt) to hang around in and for rust to form.  Rust is
most likely to form at water/air interfaces and junctions of dissimilar
metals.  That junction of body, plate, nut and bolt provides lots of
both.

&gt; Is this a common problem?

Alas, it is very common.  The only real cure is to have that piece of
metal replaced, which is a fair job.
