What I really like about this list is the promptness and thoroughness of the
many response from multiple well-informed listees. Thanks for advising me on
those manuals. I do have the Weir book(came with the Westy) , though it is
in worse shape than the Dead Sea Scrolls, and some key sections have been
conspicuously liberated from their respected areas of the book. I'll need a
new copy, natch.
