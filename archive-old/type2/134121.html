Subject: brake booster hose

Hello all,

A while ago, an affordable source for brake booster hose came up as a
topic. After the thread had expired, someone was kind enough to p-mail
me about an even cheaper source than the one discussed on the list. I
saved this information in a safe place - and now I cannot find it ... 

Who can jog my memory? I now need to replace the brake booster vacuum
hose on two buses and would like to do it with the real stuff. Related
to this: are the plastic hose clamps and rubber sleeves for the
connections still available? Can someone with ETKA dig up the part
numbers for these?

Thanks a lot,
Marcus
