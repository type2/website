Subject: [T2] brakes

I have a 72 Bus that is in pretty good condition.  I have one problem:  The 
brakes pull to the left a lot.  I know my brake booster is not hooked up but 
should I have this problem because of that.  Or do I just need a brake job.  
If its not to hard I'd like to do it myself.  So if anyone can help me or 
tell me where I should start that would be much appreciated.

Thank You
Jon
