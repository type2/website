I have not seen the commercial with the Caddy, but I have seen the one 
where the girlfriend empties out the U-haul truck and another truck runs 
over the guy's motorcycle.

The commercial is so over-the-top it makes me cringe and laugh at the 
same time.

I don't think that these commercials are about man-hating at all. I 
think, on the contrary, that the ad agency has done some crafty 
psychology by suggesting that women in relationships should &quot;do the math&quot; 
and match their SO's spending on toys with spending on shoes.

Nevertheless, this is one in a whole strain of advertisements that I have 
noticed where it is considered &quot;cute&quot; or &quot;funny&quot; when people are very, 
very mean-spirited. I do not want to bore anyone to tears, but: this is a 
reflection of where pop culture seems to want us to be. It is also 
probably a byproduct of a booming economy. The middle to late 1920s were 
similar in some ways. And that's good news. It won't last forever.

So on to bus content, sort of. A VW bus is a symbol of the polar opposite 
of the attitude discussed above. It's about waving, and signing on to the 
AIRS page, and a reminder of a time not so long ago when it was not 
considered cute to be mean. 

Somewhere, sometime today, someone in a commercial or a TV show or on a 
radio talk show is going to make fun of giving people hugs. So hug 
somebody. Do a good deed. Go the second mile. Turn the other cheek.  

Be the bus.
