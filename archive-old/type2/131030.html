Subject: roof rack for 78

Hiya,

I happen to have something that would work for you.
I don't need them for the westie (they would work for it too) but
they were perfect on the 78 bus I parted out.

I was wanting $100 Canadian for them.
I also have some used retractable seatbelts Im going to sell. Pic's in the
directory.

&gt;   I've decided to finally get the canoe up off the roof of my van and put
&gt; it on a real rack.  now of the brands and models avaliable what gets you
&gt; high enough to fit over the hump in the roof without sitting waaaaay above
&gt; the roof, I would like it to just barely clear the roof if I can, don't
&gt; need tooo much wind turbulence up there.
