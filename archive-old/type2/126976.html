Subject: [T2]Camping question(Everybus){camp stove}

we recently was given a new coleman camp stove as a gift.....
curious though.....
how safe are these in the bus...(not cooking in the bus ){the cylinders in the bus}.... diffrent temps through the summer and such...while camping not for keeping in there while daily driving ....~!~
 
also how many should we need how efficent are they .... even lets say if i were to hook a new one up&gt;(cylinder) and cook on high if needed be...? how long we got..?
dont want to get caught in the middle of a meal and run out say .. that would suc.. lol...or before we had to leave.....
i was thinking maybe 2 full cylinders was good.. maybe three..?
 
crazy questions i guess we only have so much room in the little bus ; until we can build or buy a trailer either way until we can afford it lol..
 
so i suppose you can cook on these stoves just like a normal gas stove at home....?
the stove is a coleman two burner (5430B700G) a common stove at  say wal mart
 
i am thrilled that we finally got some essentials for camping ........ cant wait to go ...
four more nights for us three more nights for others,...... ....
hope to see yall by canadian breakfast....
Greg keep it stirred up we hope to be no later than 9am.....
peace you all have a safe trip.......anyone wants to fall in i will be comeing up 85 north from sc/////.....
leaving out around 4- 430 am.&lt;from our home in boiling springs/...friday  / cool that time of morning and not alot of traffic....
will more than likely stop half way in for a coffee break.. i think its about three or four hours from here..? let grace rest a bit...20 - 30 minutes maybe...? depends on the oil temp....
no big hills to climb i am hopeing..?
except for kings mountain..?
 
if you need to reach me you can get me on my cell _at_ 864-431-4980 ....... wont be able to talk much friday though.... prepaid phone..... but give me a minute to pull pver....LOL..
so i can write down where to look for you on the way or what exit to meet you at..?
 
 
Sing let the sun shine let it shine let it shine.....~!~
Peace
Cha
 
also is there a place to make a Fire...? a small one ?........
