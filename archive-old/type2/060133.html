Hey Y'all,
   I was out working on my 70 Bus and decided it would be a good idea to 
clean the gas tank out before I put the motor in. I took it out and 
discovered a filter in the outlet. Its a brass screen with the pick up 
tube inside, and it was a mess. I did not know that it was there and I'm 
sure I'm not the only one. There is one in the top of some fuel pumps 
also. If you have never checked it you might want too the next time your 
all dirty and smell like gas.
   I have the two tone beige/brown interior in my Bus and have looked 
for replacement seat covers but have only found the one color type. does 
anyone carry the two tone like originals? I like the look and want to 
keep it.
   Is the rear eng tin (RIR) the same on the 70 Bus as the Bug? I need 
to know because mine is missing and I want to get a new one.
   I also worked on the sliding door today. I removed it and cleaned all 
the rollers and there tracks. then I lubed them and reinstalled the 
door. WOW It works so smooth and nice, just like a new door. If you want 
to know how to do this drop me a line. It is very easy and worth the 
effort.
   Does anyone have an extra H-4 light that they would like to sell. I 
need one. I don't care if its Hella, Bosch, or Japanese. I only need 
one. (7&quot; round)
   Also I need a spare tire mount for the wide 5. I'd like one that I 
can install the hub cap on the wheel when its on the mount.
