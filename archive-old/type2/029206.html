&gt;Take it to a good alignment shop, and have them do a 4-wheel alignment for

&gt;&gt; My 1970 bus, on the left rear tire, has positive camber.
&gt;&gt; I think I understand how to correct / adjust this,

My 78 has a weird problem like this. The right side has almost positive
camber, that is the tire has no camber which seems strange because the left
tire has more then the normal amount of  negative camber. It looks to me
like the whole rear torsion tube carrier got pushed up on the left side but
I can't see any evidence of this other then the weird stance. I have never
measured the height of each side to see how level it is but the bus looks
level.

I have had Midas, my VW mechanic and my body guy look at it for body/rear
end damage (the left upper shock mount was broken and my body guy welded it
for me) and they have all said they don't see anything wrong. I realize
that Midas is not a &quot;good alignment shop&quot;, but I knew the guys over there
since I worked at a store nearby so they at least didn't do a bunch of
unrelated work to the bus. My VW mechanic said that if my rear tires
started wearing funny to worry about it then and the left one does on the
inside edge.

Eventually I will adjust the sag on the rear torsion bars and examine the
whole situation more closely. If I have the transmission out at the same
time I may even look at how the torsion bar housing is installed and drop
it. But I probably never will since I don't have a garage or asphalt to do
this on and my wife lives in fear of me taking the bus apart and not
putting it back together. This is a real fear since the bus was off the
road for 2 years while I procrastinated installing the dashboard which was
sitting on the front seat near a mass of unmarked wires...
