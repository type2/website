Subject: Re: [T2] A Friday Busaru Story (spotop)

&lt;Spotop_at_gmail_dot_com&gt; was wondering about
&gt;  two smaller motorcycle radiators mounted in the upper vents where 
&gt;air would normally come in, one on
&gt;  each side .. .

	I think this may be a rather bad idea.
	Those air scoops are, in a normal Bay, the source of not only 
the cooling air but also the combustion air.  If you slap in a 
liquid-cooled motor, e.g a 2.2-L Soobaroo, those air intakes are no 
longer a main source of cooling fluid for the motor, but they are 
still the intakes for the combustion air.  Once the engine is warmed 
up, pre-heating the combustion air looks bad, doesn't it?  You want 
to take in as much oxygen as possible per intake stroke, so  you want 
the densest air i.e coolest air for the motor.
	BTW it is also true that even liquid-coooled motors get some 
cooling from air rushing past them.  The sump is the main surface for 
this minor cooling, but other surfaces also get hot and will lose 
heat better if the air is not pre-warmed by dumping heat into it from 
radiators.
	BTfurtherW similar reasoning suggests that extra oil coolers 
in front of the main radiators in water-cooled engines is a less than 
optimal arrangement.
	In Busaulic's front radiator disguised as a spare wheel, he 
avoids all such conflicts, and the long pipes to &amp; from that radiator 
are themselves minor aids to cooling.  His remedy for excessive 
cooling would appear to be just a smaller radiator.  Save weight; do 
0 - 60 mpg in 14.9 s instead of 15 s ;-}
