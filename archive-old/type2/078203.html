Subject: Re: [T2] Relay power to coil?

I think that this would be a well worth while exercise. I have been thinking about this for a while, as my 74 bus has a hell of a lot of stuff hanging off the coil wire. IE: coil, fuel pump, carb choke heaters, idle cut off solenoid etc. The wire to the coil is only thin so the voltage drop must be quite considerable considering all the current being drawn. If I were to do it I would run a cable directly from the battery to the relay (possibly with some sort of fuse or fusible link in line), have the relay operated by the coil wire, then run this switched wire to a fuse block, giving each thing I run it's own appropriately rated fuse (i.e. one fuse for the carbs, one for the coil, one for the fuel pump and so on). I would like to hear others opinions on this, as I am definitely not a bus expert (just a pedantic electrician).

&gt; 
&gt; When I installed driving lights on my '73 bus recently, I ran power directly
&gt; from the battery to the light relay at the front of the bus.  In doing so, I
&gt; started thinking about some other accessories I run from existing wiring
&gt; that might do better running directly from the battery through a relay
&gt; energized when the coil is hot.  In my case, I also run the electric fuel
&gt; pump and an engine hour meter from the hot side of the coil.
&gt; 
&gt; So, my question is, would it make sense to run power directly from the
&gt; battery to a relay, which when energized by the ignition wire to the coil
&gt; would provide power to the coil, fuel pump and hour meter?  The power should
&gt; be full voltage for the coil, not having to go all the way to the front of
&gt; the bus and back.
&gt; 
&gt; Opinions welcome.
&gt; 
&gt; Also, has anyone done any other wiring cleanup in the engine compartment of
&gt; their bus?  I remember a picture of Bob Hoover's bus once and he had done
&gt; additional wiring cleanups into terminal blocks, etc.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks,
