Subject: re:Load rating 

&gt;What are the load ratings for older busses, and older single and crew 
&gt;cabs in particular?
&gt;Well, I also own a genuine hunk of Detroit steel, and was curious about 
&gt;it's load capacity versus VW's.
&gt;I have a 1964 Ford F-100 Crewcab (special order from Ford) that is a 
&gt;1/2 ton. &lt;they didn't make crewcabs until '66&gt;
&gt;My Vanagon is load rated at 1 ton.
&gt;Interesting that a standard Vanagon has twice the load rating.

That is interesting isn't it. Our Daycare Provider's son who should be 
leaving home any year now as he's 31 yrs old, is a real macho type with a
1/2 ton to match. You know the type. Huge tires, puddle of power steering fluid
under the steering box, roll bar with covered lights, Shakle extensoins on the 
springs, runnig boards with lights, ladders to get into it....
One of those trucks that adds at least an inch (in his mind anyways) to the 
owners Snap_On_Tool;-)
Well he thinks my van is the silliest thing in the world, and he has a hard
time believing that I could have fathered a child when I drive such a sissy
car.
So one day he is polishing away when I show up, and I ask him, playing dumb
(I can be real good at playin dumb;-)) &quot; This truck of yours is it a 3 ton, or
a 5 ton?&quot;
He says &quot;Huh???&quot;
I say &quot;how much will it carry 5 tons, or is it just a 3 ton?&quot;
He looks at me like I'm just totally clueless, and says &quot;No its only
a 1/2 ton.&quot;
I reply with an incredulous smile &quot; You mean that this big mean looking 
macho truck of yours will only carry one half as much as my cute little 
Volkswagon van????&quot;
He says &quot;What do you mean?&quot;
I reply &quot;Well my little van is actually a 1 ton truck underneath. I find
it hard to believe that this truck of yours is only a 1/2 ton. I don't think
I could live with being seen driving something that only carries 1000lbs!&quot;

Suddenly someting on the bottom of the other side of his truck desparately 
needed polishing;-)
