For Maizey, I bought a sticker that says
&quot;Too Slow, Too Bad&quot;

It really does keep tailgaters from snuggling up your ass when on the
road.

I bought the sticker at a VW get together several years ago.

I need one for Casper before I leave on our 6 week trip starting the 25th.
Does anybody know where I can get one???
