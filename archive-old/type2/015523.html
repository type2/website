&gt;Be sure that the clamps and terminals are clean and dry before proceeding.

Also, to keep your alternator happy, keep the battery case, particularly
the top, clean, to stop cross cell paracitic draw. Put your VOM posative
lead on the + term. Touch the top of the batt at various points across the
top. See more than 0.1 volt??? You are stressing the whole system and
cutting the life out of your battery and alternator. Stops rot of the tray
as well.
