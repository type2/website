&gt;Just wondering--is that thermal switch in the duct adjustable? I know it's
&gt;almost impossible to get to, but I wonder if there is an adjustment that is
&gt;supposed to me made when installing the heater. I just put mine in the way
&gt;it came, and the heater works fine. But you know, once these things are done
&gt;the mind starts to play tricks on you...
 
Yes, the temperature regulating switch is adjustable via the two screws on
the front and back of the switch (rearward screw sets cut-in, forward screw
sets cut-off of the fuel pump).  It's a good idea to get it set properly--I
too am guilty of not adjusting mine despite the fact that decent electronic
measuring equipment is available these days.  If you're lucky, an adjustment
of the high end could allow you to squeeze out a few more degrees of comfort
so the effort might bear some reward.  Since the manual states the procedure
succinctly, I'll just copy the text here for everyone's benefit.

****BTW---Is anyone out there willing to scan about 100 pages of manual for
me? I'd love to have the relevant BN4 service manuals accessible at my site.
The currently available online manual for the BN4 lacks too much information
to be very useful for the 12 volt people especially.  Please contact me via
Pmail if you can help.  Thanks!****

Temperature regulating switch specs from VW Workshop manual, 7th Supplement,
3/73:

&quot;Cut-in or cut-off temperature difference: 20 degrees Celsius (68 degrees
Fahrenheit).
Cut-in temperature: 60 degrees Celsius (140 degrees Fahrenheit)
Cut-off temperature: approx:
Type 1/ Model 181:  110-130 deg C (230-266 deg F)
Type 2 : 120-140 deg C (250-285 deg F)
These temperatures can be checked only with electronic instruments&quot;

Setting the Regulator Switch Procedure from Espar manual, 1974:

&quot;Block about 1/3 of the return air inlet.  Back off adjusting screws on the
regulating switch all the way.  Set regulating switch to the &quot;large&quot;
position; switch on heater.  Note outlet air temperature: At 130 deg C (266
deg F) screw in adjusting screw [forward screw pictured] until the fuel
metering pump stops.  Set regulating switch to the &quot;small&quot; position.  Note
outlet air temperature: At 60 deg C (140 deg F), screw in adjusting screw
[rearward screw pictured] until the fuel metering pump begins to tick again.
Test the regulating switch again in the same manner, checking the
temperatures at which it switches, which should be as follows:  In the
&quot;large&quot; position, the regulating switch should switch off at a temperature
between 120 deg C and 130 deg F (248 deg F and 266 deg F).  After the
regulating switch has switched off, it should switch on again in the &quot;small&quot;
position at a temperature of between 50 deg C and 70 deg C (122 deg F and
158 deg F).  If the adjusting range of the adjusting screws is not
sufficient, the basic setting of the lever can be altered relative to the
bimetal spiral (slot on the lever).  Seal adjusting screws with paint.&quot;

Bob or Oly (or anyone else who might try this adjustment)--I'd be curious to
know the readings you get before adjustment, just to see how far off that
bimetallic spring can get with age/use.
