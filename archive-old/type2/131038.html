Subject: Re: [T2] tires

I picked up some 195's for mine.. not a bad price, LT 8 ply Cooper Tires...
they look really
cool too :)

Thanks for the input guys!
On another note the tranny I got works, it's set up (030) with my 2 liter fi
motor and seems
to be working ok with the setup to bypass all the vacumn settings.  I just
treated the canvas for the
poptop tonight which is in amazing shape.

J

&gt; &gt;heck I have 205's on mine
&gt;
&gt;
 Me too!
