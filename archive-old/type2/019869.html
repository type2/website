Subject: Removing the sliding door handle on a 72 bay
Message-ID: &lt;39DD09E0.1360.29C8F6_at_localhost&gt;
Priority: normal
X-mailer: Pegasus Mail for Win32 (v3.12c)

We are trying to replace the lock barrel on the sliding door of our 72 bus 
but are having difficulties in removing the door handle itself. I was hoping it 
would been a simple case of removing the inner door handle and sliding the 
outer door out of the mechanism - obviously no such luck. Has anyone done 
this and got any tips and suggestions etc?
Thanks.
