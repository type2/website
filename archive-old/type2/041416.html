Subject: Pics of the 216K  Westy-3rd bed &amp; other Mod's

Shelby Bell was kind enough to create a Geocities site of my &quot;Pod&quot; 78
Westy, showing the 3rd bed I added and other changes such as putting in
a 3 adult bed/seat, turning the spare tire well into a storage cabinet,
adding a flip table to the sliding door, TV, VCR, Sega, rear radio, and
out side storage options (I just sent them to him) like the pod, bike
rack, and firewood storage box on bumper.
It's http://www.geocities_dot_com/mike_benthin
