Subject: RE: [T2] silly oil leak

I read Muirs before on this. And I know I didn't break anything.
Didn't overtighten it.
And yup, all the old gasket material was removed.
I think I will redo it &lt;again&gt;
and make sure that I got all the crud off the edge where the
gaskets seal to on the case.
Try Try again.

:)

Didja get the old gasket off?

The secret dance can be found on page 83 of the Muir book when you read it 
backwards with a German accent.
