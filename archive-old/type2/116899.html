Subject: &quot;Shifting Gears&quot; on the History Channel

Greetings All.

I had a strange experience at the Dead show last night in Irvine, CA. No - 
not that kind of experience....

I was in the parking lot before the show hanging out in the V-dub with my 
wife when I was approached by a camera crew from the history channel. They 
were doing a piece on VW bus culture for a new show called &quot;Shifting Gears&quot;. 
I had to sign some paperwork and they filmed me answering some questions 
(about the pop-top, the interior, the paint, etc. etc.), then took a ton of 
footage of the outside of my westy and said they would contact me if my bus 
was to be featured.

I was totally floored. Even if my bus doesn't get featured, it was cool to 
have a tv crew take notice of my pride and joy...what a better spot than the 
lot before a show to see some bus culture....hundreds of busses (from Splits 
to Euros).

I am curious, was anyone else from the list approached? I will keep an eye 
out on the web site and let everyone know when the spot airs. It is a new 
show that starts this saturday and it's 30 minutes.



Cheers,
