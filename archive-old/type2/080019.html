Subject: Re: [T2] t4 heat exchanger help needed

&gt;Can someone who has seen one of these in proper shape tell me what it is
&gt;supposed to look like and how it should truely fit?  Where the clamp is
&gt;spotwelded doe not appear to let the other pipe meet up with it very well.

One more thing that struck me for a real PITA assembly that doesn't want
to stay together no matter what after a few miles popping back apart etc.
Once you get it together and in place a single judiciusly placed 1/8&quot; pop
rivet through the overlap will keep it together pretty much permanent like.
Combined with plenty of good super copper RTV to improve a poor fit this
is a final way to get it together if you can't make the metal fit well.  I did
this on the '82 after twice losing the VERY hard to find bit on the input side
of the left Vanagon exchanger.  The riser outlet side you pretty much can't
lose as it is attached to the tin and to the flapper valve but a single $0.01
rivet can keep that joint together instead of &quot;flapping in the wind.&quot;  In fact
on some where the clamp is rusted off (common) and I got tired and peaved
at hose clamps I've just pop riveted in 2-3 places and it is good
indefinitely.
Yeah it takes a whole 60 seconds to drill em out next time you want to
change the heater boxes, etc.  But so what...
