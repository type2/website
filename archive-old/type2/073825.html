Subject: Re: [T2] setting timing on '78

--part1_2d.11d2e612.28e8b6d4_boundary

A picture is located in the Volkswagen service manual for type 2, 68 thru 79 
by Bentley in chapter 5 on engine and clutch page 23 figure 8-1 and page 24 
figure 8-2. it is mounted above and to the left of the pully, using the top 
and left bolt for the pully gaurd. The timing notch is cut into the pully lip 
(on the inside lip and hard to see) mark it well with white paint. And if you 
find another one beside the one you need let me know cause I also need one 
for my 78.
