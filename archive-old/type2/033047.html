Roland,

     Thanks.  I will be taking a look at it this weekend.  Sure would be
nice to not have to buy that new fule pump.  We will see.

&gt; When I had the same problem I discovered that one of the air hoses
&gt; connecting from the outlet hose of the AFM to the air distributor via
&gt; the auxiliary air valve had sufficient free play at its connection to
&gt; allow air to leak into the system (basically a vacuum leak that allowed
&gt; air to temporarily get to the cylinders without being measured by the
&gt; AFM, which results in too lean a mixture). After the engine warmed up,
&gt; the auxiliary valve shuts down so the problem goes away, only to return
&gt; when the engine needs to be started again when cold. I put a clamp on
&gt; the offending connection. So check the hose connections in that part of
&gt; the air distribution system.
