Subject: Re:grounding engine/trans

Quoth Steve Dolan:
...the one (ground)everyone neglects because it is
hidden is the trans to chassis strap.  The amazing thing is that this is
the only dedicated ground connection between the engine/trans assembly and
the body (and battery)! ........
    Then all you'd need for insurance is another ground wire piggied from
the battery negative to the engine?  BTW, didn't the &quot;brain&quot; (MPC) have its
own ground wire?
