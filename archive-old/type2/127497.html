Subject: Re: [T2] Solder Advice

&gt; I about to embark on some &quot;wiring surgery&quot; on some (many) cut wires in my
&gt; engine compartment and under my dash. There are far too many unattached
&gt; wires and ones with bad cheap connectors.
&gt;
&gt; My goal is to solder using original wire and cover the solder area with the
&gt; original plastic color, giving it a nice clean original look.
&gt;
&gt; I have not solder in years so my question is what is the best way to achieve
&gt; my goal and still get a good solder? Should the wires be placed side by
&gt; side, end to end, twisted together, etc...?

not end to end.
you can twist them and then solder the two or
tin the 2 ends and solder them side by side.
either is fine.
the twisting is going to leave a bigger lump.

I dont know why you would need to cover the solder joints with the same
color. just use some heat shrink tubing any color. the spots will be
small. It is a good idea to use the correct matching wire to do the
repairs.
