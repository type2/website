Subject: loss of power, bad sound and now

Well on the way home from work, the local volunteer fire dept siren went off
and as I pulled into the neighborhood I saw on of my neighbors cars on fire.
So jumped out of the bus and spent the fire extinguisher and waited for the
fire dept.  They came, stopped the fire, so I got back in the 71 Westy and
headed up the street and smoke was pouring out of my exhaust.  Last night the
#2 spark plug blew out and I put it back in and the bus has ran fine, no
engine lights, but now smoke from the exhaust.  The exhaust was quite white
and went away in about 100 yards.  I've started the engine again a couple of
times and no smoky exhaust has returned.  Any suggestions?
