well..while at the shop today I got a lot more work done...I'll get even
more work done tonight...by the end of the night the bus will be ready
to weld up.
I cut out the drivers side rocker (what was left of it) and the inner
rocker as it was rusted to bits...
after getting through the inch deep bondo and fiberglass sheet...I found
something I never want to see again...
PAPER BAGS wadded up inside the rocker to support the bondo!!!!  I must
have pulled out 2 bags or more.._dot_cardboard etc..!!! still damp too!!!
wow...I couldn't believe it.

so I will be ordering my metal soon and welding it up and putting the
bus back together....

tip of the day : don't shove paper bags inside of your rockers.
