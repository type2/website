Hey all,
So tonight we decided to ramble down HWY. 1 to have dinner at a little
pub we like in Big Sur proper.  As we are heading home (11 miles) on a
nice flat stretch I am doing about 50, I want to build up some speed
coming up on the hill, so I go to WOT(wide open throttle), foot to the
floor.  It goes, plunk, plunk, plunk and feels like it is not getting
enough gas.  I let up on the accelerator, and it runs fine.  I repeat
this several times with the same results.  It ran fine all day, never
had this happen prior to tonight.  Later when we are climbing up the
hill, I am at WOT and no problem.  Did not have a chance to get back
above 50 before we came to our turn off for home, which is windy little
canyon road.  Going up the very steep incline up the mountain to our
house the engine was really strong.  I am a little freaked out by this. 
The only other thing I noticed recently is it sounds a little rough when
I put it into gear (this is an automatic).  My first thought was that
the transmission is starting to go, and it is slipping when I go to WOT,
but I think it would slip even more under a heavy load going up a
mountain switch back, which it handles fine.
Any ideas?  Oh the other thought I have is that it is very dusty driving
the dirt portion of our driveway, it was dark and I have not had a
chance to check the air filter to see if it has gotten really clogged
with dust, but again it would seem that it would require allot of air
when going up hill...
Thanks,
Scoob
