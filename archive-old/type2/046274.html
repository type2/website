Subject: Re: [T2] Is this happening to you?

There does seem to be a sort of bus Renaissance going on.

We've always had plenty of buses in the neighborhood, partly because we are
next to a small college campus.  But this Fall we have [including our own
bus] a 1970 Campmobile, a 1976 Campmobile and a Vanagon home-built camper
conversion all living on a single block of our street.

Within a 3 or 4 block radius there's another 6 or 7 resident buses, plus a
half dozen or so parked near the campus by commuting students.

Our Wetwesties Pacific Northwest camping group has had 3 weekend
gatherings/campouts within the last month, and folks seem to come out of the
woodwork to admire the rigs and offer positive comments about them.

At one of our events, which occupied most of a small Oregon State Park
campground, folks from an enormous Class A motorhome spent time checking out
our buses and admiring the simplicity and clever design of the campers and
commenting wistfully on the ease with which we could pack up and get under
way.

I expect some of the renewed interest has to do with the perceived economy
of operation, especially fuel consumption as even cheap fuel creeps toward
$2.00/gallon.  And perhaps some is because of a developing backlash against
ridiculously complex and expensive vehicles like &quot;Luxury SUVs&quot; [hey, there's
always hope].

I don't know about other parts of the USA, but if new baywindow buses were
available up here they wouldn't be able to keep them in stock.

FWIW.....

&gt;&gt;  Well in just the last few months we've had a lot of people take notice
of
out present bus in a positive way.  We've had a stranger step off the curb
while we were stopped at a traffic light and ask to buy our bus.  We've also
had people pull up next to us on the highway, while doing 50-60 miles per
hour, and ask if we wanted to sell our bus.  The best of all is when  teens
and kids shout stuff at us as we go by.  Usually it's something like &quot;cool
car&quot; or &quot;hey I like your van&quot; and one time it was &quot;radical ride man&quot;.  The
funniest was when a comment came from a girl who was riding in the back of
her mom's luxury SUV.  &lt;&lt;
