    take care of it or get rid of it.

...And remember, one less vehicle being manufactured for 
every old VW/whatever on the road. Just because a new
vehicle is less of a polluter than an older one doesn't dis-
count the pollution involved in manufacture. Electric/hy-
brid cars are similar...the pollution is moved further up-
stream; more controllable perhaps, but there...
