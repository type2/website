CW cranks have enough metal added that the use of a light flywheel brings
the system back to it's &quot;before&quot; state regarding rotational mass. So, the
use of a CW crank and a light flywheel drives the same as a non-CW crank and
a stock flywheel, but has the benefit of keeping the case in good shape due
to the CWs.

I routinely run light flywheels on all my engines (CW or not) as long as
they are in type 1s, but not type 2s.

One more thing: if you have a 78 or bigger crank, you have enough grunt due
to the displacement increase and stroke leverage (you get advantages twice)
that you don't need a heavy flywheel, you are better off with a light one.
