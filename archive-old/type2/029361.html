Having a real seal is essential. i purchased a new lugage rack seal for my
78 this summer from a well known vendor. it was not a seal , aerodynamic
streses put on the fiberglass and the damage of rain etc make these seals
useless and no better than no seal at all. i had this replacement &quot;seal&quot;
for a day and fortunetly i wasted only $15 i ordered a proper one from
gowesty_dot_com.  the pretend seals are useless for a westy that is actually
driven, they are for show only, my advice is don't risk your fiberglass
top or your canvas to a part that does not perform the function of the
part it is replacing, it like replacing the windshield with saran wrap.
the fix that allowed me to get back from the show i was at was to use
masking tape to seal it off, i would never drive any distance with the gap
open, the potential for damage is just too great.
good luck
jamie
