Subject: RE: [T2] Power Windows (talk about LUXURY!)

&gt; we just got our OEM VW &quot;Station Wagon&quot; brochure
&gt; for 1969. Interestingly enough, the VW literature
&gt; consistently refers to the bus as a &quot;station wagon.&quot;


This was due to the &quot;chicken tariff&quot; on imported trucks imposed in 1963. The
tariff was a U.S. retaliation over a trade dispute between the U.S. and
Germany regarding U.S.chicken exports, and was later expanded to include all
imported trucks. The 25 percent (!!!) import tarriff on import trucks still
exists to this day. Volkswagen avoided the tariff by reclassifying the
passenger version of the Bus (and later the Vanagon and Eurovan) as a
&quot;station wagon.&quot;  However the stiff tarriff eventually forced them to
abandon the actual &quot;truck&quot; market in the U.S., which is why German VW pickup
trucks and delivery vans were never sold here after 1971. (The short-lived
Rabbit pickup was U.S. made.)  Meanwhile, Japanese companies skirted the
tariff by importing their pickup trucks separately from the cargo beds as
&quot;incomplete vehicles,&quot; and bolting them together here.
