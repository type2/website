Subject: Re: [T2] Noise in high milage engine (was synth. oil)

Rev it to 3K rpm and hold it for a few seconds and let it fall to idle.

I usually hear rods rattle as the rpms fall.

Could also be a wrist pin bushing.

I my experience it is hard to hear bottom end problems right next to the 
motor so in the van might make it easier to hear. Low frequency noises I 
guess.

&gt;      The list is tired of hearing me gloat- I've got 233,000 mi on my 78
&gt;Westy, runs fine but does blow a qt of oil per fillup (no sign of
&gt;burning); oil pressure this summer depended on temp- at a high of 250
&gt;deg it will only do 22 psi at 3000 rpm, so I run it cooler (slower) than
&gt;I used to.  In winter It's hard to get it to 212 (ideal to get the water
&gt;out) and it's over 33 psi.   Oil changes are about every 3-5K and I'vre
&gt;used TUFOIL (ptfe/moly additive) since I got the bus with 60K on it.
&gt;Before being fully warmed up (but long after oil pressure is up) it has
&gt;a new sound upon acceleration that's not quite a knock but depends on
&gt;rpms and is sort of a sound I've heard on bugs when the differential is
&gt;going (a shhhr-shhhr noise).  I CANNOT hear it when my head is in the
&gt;engine, only when I sit up front.  In the engine compartment I hear a
&gt;slight knocking on the left side- distr/cam? I had a rod bearing go on a
&gt;bug, and that was a decided knock on acceleration.  If it were a rod,
&gt;would this sound be diminished if the ignition to that cylinder were
&gt;removed temporarily as a test?
