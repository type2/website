&gt;It was $89, and included the tail pipe stuff, with bracket, gaskets,
&gt;silencer pipe, etc.  I thought this was a pretty good deal.  The other one
&gt;ran me ~$140 once I got all the pieces together...

Mr. Forhan has inspired me.

Bob Wallace posted awhile back about British-made stainless mufflers (which
he calls 'exhaust boxes' because he speaks a peculiar dialect of English
called English). Once road-salt season is over I'm gonna try to whip up a
muffler frenzy and import a raft of them. Might even let the vintagevw
crowd in on it if they promise not to act ugly. ;)
