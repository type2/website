&gt; So, if an altitude compensation was required for fuel injection I

&gt; compensator I would love to see it.  I am always so fascinated with
&gt; the various engineering feats that VW has come up with over the
&gt; years.

The altitude comp was for busses that ran at high altitudes, or even
worse at high &amp; low altitudes all the time. Without this the FI system
really didn't have a good way to adjust the mixture for the less dense
air at high altitudes. I have seen a pic somewhere, but couldn't find
it just now.
