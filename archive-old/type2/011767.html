I would rec cleaning VERY well, with TSP to remove mildew, then
much pressure washing.  Sand as you think needed, though it is
going to have plenty of tooth as it is.  Rough it all with at least 220
dry though recalling fiberglass dust is nasty YOU MUST use an N95
nuisance mask AT LEAST (one with two rubber straps not the crappy
cheap dust masks.)  Then I've had good luck using the wonder of
all products, sprayable polyester filler in this instance.  In fact that
is basically what they would do in a re gell-coat as all the gell coat
was was a layer of polyester (or vinylester not sure which VW used)
down in the mold first against the smooth surface.  The spray poly
will do nicely,  Feather Fill is the good commercial stuff, I've also
used a cheaper pro product called Z-Chrome Rust Defender (only
$50/gallon or so.)  You can't build like a commercial re gell-coat but
you'll get a similar adhesion, better than any other primer/surfacer.
In fact I've had a mind to just try spraying some thinned UV resistant
clear vinylester I have laying around from some composite layup but
would hate to &quot;experiment&quot; and have it come off 2 years later.  The
polyester primer surfacers are colored unfortunately so you can tell
where you have sprayed and unless you want the top bright yellow
(for the Z-chrome) you'll have to top coat.

Sand it as needed and finish with whatever white paint you would like,
and you might consider adding flex additive (about half reccomended)
to forestall cracking and crazing though it wouldn't be typical say on
a vette.  Should last well, I've done one small pre '67 top for a friend
in this manner, though it was small enough that I sandblasted it to
clean it up for convenience.  I've seen a lot of em painted, they come
out too white, but that is to be lived with.  Looks better than mildewy
crud.  I'd use urethane paints also, a cheap acryllic urethane should
be fine, and steer clear of laquer which will be too brittle.  And of course
I'll plug using PPG products, best in the business.
