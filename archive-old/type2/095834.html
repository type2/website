Subject: RE: [T2] 70 speedo adjustment?

Hi Chris,

NO NO NO a bias ply 7.00 14 is NOT the same as an R14; bias ply or  called
CROSS PLY tyres are not the same as RADIAL indicated by the R.
Mixing these up could easily make your bus into a death trap - read up in
Bentley etc on how to use both types safely on the same vehicle, then of
course you will have to carry 2 spares as you don't know which tyre you will
puncture.

Cross ply or Bias tyres are now rather old fashioned and much better road
holding and ride is achieved by using radial tyres (although cross ply
fitted to a trailer does, so I'm told, improve the way it follows the towing
vehicle)

7.00 14 tyres were fitted up to July 71 then 185 R 14.

7.00 is a the width of the tyre tread in inches i.e. equivalent to 175mm
14 is the diameter (always in inches) of the metal centre of the wheel

The default aspect ratio of a tyre (from memory) is 82% (i.e. a 185/82R14 is
the same size as a 185R14)

so the  correct equivalent size (in metric) to the size of bias tyres
originally specified for your bus would be 175 R 14.
A 175R14 would have a tyre height of 175*0.82=142mm. The 195/70R14 has a
height of 195*0.7=136mm.
Overall diameter of a 175R14 = 2*142 + 14*25.4 = 640mm
Overall diameter of a 195/70R14 = 2*136 + 14*25.4 = 628mm

circumference is directly proportional to diameter so your wrong size tyres
will cause a 2% higher reading in the speedo. If your speedo is reading
80mph then it should be reading 78mph. I'm not sure that I believe that from
a 1600SP engine

The likely cause of error in your speedo is simply that after 32 years the
spring against which the needle is pushed is getting weak. Also
manufacturers tend to err on the side of caution and most (mechanical)
speedos will read a bit low even when new.

A replacement speedo could cure it but you won't know the state of the
spring untill its in use.

As others have said the simplest way is to use a GPS to 'calibrate' your
speedo; or do it by long hand and get a passenger to time you between two
'mile posts' while you drive a steady speed between them and then do the
simple arithmetic to find your true mph and therefore the percentage error
in your speedo.

Good luck

&gt; i just looked at the sticker behind my driver seat and it reads:
&gt; bias ply 7.00 - 14
&gt; doesnt that mean the same as &quot;R14&quot;?
&gt;
&gt; waving and wishin i had the money to splerge on a GPS :^P
&gt; chris

&gt; &gt; ... The 195/70R14's are the cause of your speedo error
&gt; &gt; Or buy your own GPS and use it instead of the bus speedo. You will
&gt; &gt; never be lost again!
&gt; &gt; Happy trails,

&gt; &gt; &gt; 1970 westy
&gt; &gt; &gt; 195/70R14
&gt; &gt; &gt; speedometer seems to be off by 10-15MPH at highway speed and closer to
&gt; &gt; &gt; 5+MPH at low speed (neighborhood 25-30). considering it is off and
&gt; &gt; &gt; people
&gt; &gt; &gt; drive differently at different times of day, it is hard to say exactly
&gt; &gt; &gt; what speed i am actually going. i have gotten a feel for what i think
my
&gt; &gt; &gt; speed is.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; 35~30
&gt; &gt; &gt; 50~40
&gt; &gt; &gt; 75+~just under 65
&gt; &gt; &gt; 80~i wont get run over in normal highway traffic, so it is probably
&gt; &gt; &gt; between 65-70.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; i have even seen something i would never have seen if the speedo
wasn't
&gt; &gt; &gt; off... i have hit nearly 90 (probably 75ish) going down hill with a
&gt; &gt; &gt; strong tailwind... but it was neat to see, none the less.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; wavin and prayin for a tailwind,
&gt; &gt; &gt; chris
&gt; &gt; &gt; 70 westy, usually gettin passed
