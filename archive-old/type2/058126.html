Hi
Guess this is too late for your weekends work.... any way for what it is
worth...I put the same boots on my 75 bus and did not put the concave washer
on (as Bentley etc and none on anyway), but did put the boot clamps on. Pulled
them carefully with pincers. I used about 180 g of grease (double that
supplied) taking the general advise of &quot;the Sermons&quot; to add plenty. I have
done just over 4000 miles on them (all  4 replaced) and they are fine so far
!!!. I have been keeping an eye on the clamps and they still seem tight and as
fitted.
good luck :-)
