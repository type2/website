Clearer than that by a fair shot, Shawn! Exactly what I was talking about,
but in the problems you list are why I would prefer a professionally
designed/manufactured one.  

Pretty much any plate, drilled correctly will do the job, but it is a
whole lot easier to use if it is a standard thickness and faced to be flat
on both sides.  Makes the subtractions go easier if you are subtracting
2cm from 2.42cm than if you are subtracting 1.785cm from 1.827cm.  It also
helps if your center hole is not 1.785cm thick on one side and 1.792cm
thick on the other side.  Home-made plates may also be warped, as you
found so that you have to be careful which side faces whichc way. Having a
plate made that is drilled correctly and flat just makes the process
smoother.

I got a ~$150 estimate a couple years ago from a machine shop to make me a
plate that was flat and exactly 2cm thick.  I don't know if the RMMW plate
for the T1 meets this spec, but I sure hope it does or at least comes
within a thousandth or two.

One other thing on my estimate, I asked for a silicon bronze plate, which
probably increased the cost a bit. I would ideally want the plate to
be strong enough not to warp under load, but be softer than the cylinder
against which it will rest.  I figure there is no sense in buggering up a
new set of P&amp;C's :-)
