Subject: Re: [T2] 72 bus on the samba

Hello Ian,

This looks to be a factory partition. I have one of
these &quot;non-walk through&quot;  buses. You are right. It is
not as open as the buses with bucket seats but there
is a couple of things that I like about it. Having a
bench seat in the front allows you to hold your sweet
heart close to you while you are driving.  I would be
able do this in mine because mine is an automatic as
well. :) This is a good thing in the winter time to
conserve and share body heat and it can be good for
other reasons. ;) It also has a perfect place under
the seat made to hold the spare tire. There is still
plenty of room to haul tools or other small items
under there. Being that the wheel was made to go down
here, it allowes for a larger sleeping space over the
engine compartment if you choose to install a Z-bed.
The one bad thing about this is that it does make the
rear area appear smaller and you have to exit the
front of the vehicle just to get into the back. All in
all, I like the fact that my bus has a bench seat in
the front. Have a great day!

&gt; I think it would get in the way as I have 2 kids and
&gt; on a road trip it would
&gt; suck not being able to get back to the back with
&gt; that in the way.
