&gt; I need to pull the drums off of the '72 panel van I have. I can not

&gt; anything that big at the parts houses, so I might try the local
&gt; rentall

&gt; around 10 
&gt; 1/2&quot; and be able to grab the drum. Worse comes to worse, I suppose I
&gt; will 
&gt; have to see if I can have something made.

Unfortunately, a puller doesn't buy you much because the backing plate
extends around the back side of the drum.  There's no place where you
can get purchase on the drum, as I recall.

Drums are still available, backing plates aren't as easy to find.

My advice is to use lots of penetrating oil and tapping about with a
hammer.  Give the oil time to work (several hours or days).  Don't give
up on the adjusters, as they might loosen up with a penetrating oil
treatment.  If you have to, destroy the drum to preserve the
harder-to-get parts.

If the drums turn. The the drum is stuck around the hub.  Apply
penetrating oil in this region liberally.  You can remove the nut from
the axle and try pulling the splined hub off.  If you can get this off,
you can support the drum and whang away with a large hammer to free the
hub (Don't damage the machined surfaces though!)

Of course, you can always apply the &quot;blue wrench&quot;!
