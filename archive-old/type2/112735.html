Subject: Re: [T2] Propane tank question, Will this work?????????

&lt;http://www.nfpa_dot_org/Research/nfpafactsheets/propane/propane.asp&gt; Note 
the section at the end exempting horizontal cylinders. Many of the 
'service station' type refilling facilities do not know the real 
regulations.  It might pay to do some more research and have some 
documentation on-board.  I've had to fight a couple times, but I've 
always gotten the Westy and Riviera tanks filled.  As a last resort, one 
just goes to the local bulk plant.  They *know* the regulations.

&gt;We have two 20lb Horizontal tanks that we use for our oven/range. Both ARE
&gt;subject to 10 year inspection, and MUST have the new valves to be filled
&gt;here in BC. Same regs when we were in California last year.  Been there done
&gt;that, went through all of this, still had to get the new valves. Check with
&gt;Transport Canada if you are unclear.
