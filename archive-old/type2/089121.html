Subject: Re:Recomendation for Air-cooled mechanic in New York

Received a call from a bus owner +ACo- from my add - type2 buy/sell+ACo- in New York
city. He has a 79 westy that's been loosing power. He took the bus to a shop
and they told him he needed a new engine.

Can anyone recommend a competent mechanic that could give a second
opinion....
