Hi,

you wrote:
&gt; casey,
&gt; to find out thew differences between the campmobile
&gt; and the westy  check out the library section at
&gt; type2_dot_com and you can read all about em.   sounds like
&gt; your bus has had a case of camper parts swapping where
&gt; you might have a little bit of both.   check out the
&gt; site.

If this is the case then I'm in the same spot as Casey. I also have the
&quot;Campmobile&quot; label and also the Westfalia tag. Mine's a '68 as well. I
figured it meant the same thing? It doesn't seem likely in my case that
there was any parts swapping.

I will also look for the info you mentioned on the type2 site.
