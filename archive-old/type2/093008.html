I have to agree with George - 175mph in a vehicle with that much frontal 
area is very unlikely.  I haven't run the numbers but I bet it would 
require something like 800hp to achieve, and he isn't going to get that 
kind of power out of a 3.x liter Porsche engine, turbos or no turbos.  It 
certainly wouldn't have &quot;more left in it&quot; as he claims.  A 400hp Corvette 
Z06 can only manage 170mph.
