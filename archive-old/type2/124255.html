Subject: Re: [T2] UK VW Camper Magazine

This thread may be WAAAAY of topic, but I have to ask....
In the last twelve months, I have received two issues out of the promised 4,
and one of those was a back issue.
Does anyone have any contact info that would assist me in getting better
service?
They have sent me a renewal, and I have written a note about the situation,
but was hoping for an email or something.
Thank You for the bandwidth.
