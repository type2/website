Subject: 78 engine rebuild questions

Hi All,

I wrote about a month ago looking for recommendations on an engine 
rebuilder for  my 78 FI Westy.  The overwhelming suggestions were for 
Bob Donalds of Boston Engine, which is good since he is only an hour 
from where I am in New Hampshire.

I am looking for some feedback in a couple of areas.

1. Bob feels sodium filled valves are hype.  What do you all think? 
I know I have read opinions on the list in the past.

2 My case was junk, which was my fear.  The oil strainer stud was 
doing the wobble thing from being broken off from the inside of the 
case.  Bob had an available core from an 80 Vanagon or so, which he 
said just needed oil cooler mount modification.  As our conversation 
went on, he suggested we put Vanagon heads and pipes on it as well, 
and essentially make it a Vanagon engine.  My questions, will this 
work well?  What do I need to be aware of?  Why shouldn't we do this? 
Why should we? Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks in advance,

Ned
