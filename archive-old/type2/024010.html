&lt;&lt; It appears as though the wire running back
 from the ignition switch is not hot &gt;&gt;
hello  Kurt &amp;  List      Frist  check the wire at the coil with the key on . 
If it's not hot make sure you didn't leave the real hot wire hidden somewhere 
 on the left side of the motor.  If  everything is hooked correctly  then 
your problem is up front ,ingnition switch are known to go bad.  You should 
be able to hot wire the motor to run.  Just run a  wire from the battery to 
the postive side of coil , unplug to shut off .    Mark  Dearing     Salem
