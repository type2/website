&lt;&lt; Will this create too much drag for the basic-type electric fuel pump with 
presumed 5-10 psi? &gt;&gt;

You may want to confirm with the manufacturer or retailer what the the 
correct fuel pressure is for the &quot;2 bbl&quot; carb.  The Weber IDF carbs I have on 
my ghia are supposed to take_no_more_than 3 PSI or so of pressure.  5 - 10 
sounds really high and if the pressure range is truly that great, you will 
probably want to add a pressure regulator to get a more consistent (and 
correct!) value.
