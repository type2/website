Hi Phil,
The poptop seal on my Riviera looks similar to what you've
described, it's not air tight. The side seal pieces are
missing but a 6 foot section is in place on the rear most
end of the poptop roof. When I say rear most I'm referring
to the roof section above the rear hatch and air intakes
vents. That little section was in place for awhile and it
didn't make a bit of difference with the exhaust
infiltration.

The plan right now is to leave the beautiful blue tape
and goofy looking tail pipe extension on for a few days.
Then Sunday I'll either remove the tail pipe extension or
pull of the tape on the poptop roof section, the retest.
I'm not sure which would be a better approach yet.


 &gt; Perhaps your bus is haunted by an evil spirit.

So how do I use the Muir manual to bless my bus and
rid the evil spirit?
