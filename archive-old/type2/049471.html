Subject: RE: [T2] cruise control for bus?

I drove a 71 with a 1600 from the West Coast to Toronto Canada about 10
years ago.

Cruise control was easily achieved with a suitable brick.

All the discussion about split E-brake handles puts me in mind of how i
set my bus up for &quot;set speed'  or &quot;throttle hold&quot;

I think i will try and let everyone figure out how i did it.

No additional equipment needed.
