Subject: Re: [T2] please id vehicle in back ground

Add VW approved Martin Walter (Dormobile) UK conversions to my 
education.  compared that pic with others i just found of UK Dormobile 
Mods and I believe it is a definate match.  Unfortunately most of the 
sites i was finding dont have any english on them.
