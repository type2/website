Subject: Re: [T2] re: Odometer Repair in Toronto?

&gt; As someone suggested on the vanagon list..... you could always crack it
&gt; open yourself.  Apparently it's often an easy fix, so keep your fingers
&gt; crossed!  LOL

I think its more often than not a cracked gear or tooth broken off.
Easiest to just replace the speedo if you can find one cheaply.
