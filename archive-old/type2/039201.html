Subject: Retiring the van

Hello all,

I am getting closer to having my bug road worthy and retiring the daily
driving/pizza delivering/junk hauling vanagon to weekend duty.  Klunk has
been a very good sport about being used and abused for the last year and is
glad to have a cousin take over the daliy chores.  This means I will only be
using the van a couple times a month.  Is there anything special I need to
do to keep things from deriorating from lack of use?  Maybe I'm just
paranoid and driving the van once a week will be enough to keep it running
strong.  Anyway I appreciate your responses as always.
