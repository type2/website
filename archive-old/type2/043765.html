Subject: [T2] 009 timing

Hello,

I have a 1600DP in my 1969 Bus, and I use a Bosch 009. I timed the engine 
statically at 0 TDC, and I was not satisfied with it, so I timed it using my 
timing light with 30 degrees total advance, as I read in the type2 library. 
I noticed an improvement in the drivability. Is this the proper timing for 
my engine?

Now that I have retimed it, the engine does not run-on after I shut it off, 
and usually it starts more quickly as well. My only problems now are a low 
popping noise at around (im guessing) 2000-3000 rpm when the engine is 
warming up. I have been told that sound is a result of loose heads.

One last thing: My clutch pedal feels pretty soft, but I think its adjusted 
pretty well. Any suggestions?

Thank you,
Ethan
