&gt;no help has appeared....: 
&gt; 
&gt;Emmett Goldsbourough, president of the local NEATO chapter 
&gt;but not on line, is having problems finding someone to help him  
&gt;either check out a bus, or help him find someone to check it out. 
&gt;He is in Maryland, the bus is in Sacramento, CA. 

I just talked to him.  The bus is less than 5 min from my house.  I was
hesitant to jump on this one because of my ignorance of Vanagons.  Steve
Johnson and I are going to look at it this afternoon...
