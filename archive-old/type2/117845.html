Subject: Re: [T2] Engine Dies and Won't Restart (kind of long)

Beth,

I've seen coils do this before, backed out of my driveway one day
and my bug literally died in the street.  Freaked out...checked for spark
and found none....replaced with *real* Bosch and had no problems again.

Drive it till it dies and then check for the usuall culprits..

Got gas?
Got air?
Got spark?...easy to check when it dies!

Cheers, dave

&gt; I'm having a problem with my '78 Westy.  I have approximately 5000 miles on

&gt; Rotor, cap, wires replaced at rebuild.  Installed Pertronix approximately 
&gt; 1000 miles ago.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Any thoughts beside the coil out there?
&gt; 
&gt; This list has helped me so much in the past, and I'm grateful for all the 
&gt; past help.  I hope someone can help me with this puzzle....
