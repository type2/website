Subject: Re: [T2] no spark

Either your points aren't closing or they aren't opening or they are 
defective.  Turn engine 'til points are closed. Turn key on. Take a 
screwdriver and manually open the points. Spark? If yes, turn motor 'til 
points are open. Recheck gap. No spark? Check to ensure that the braided 
wire inside the distributor is intact.  If not, fix it.

&gt;I have 12v on both sides of the coil.  I installed a new set of points and
&gt;gapped them at 16 thousand. (old ones looked fine still no spark, when turned

&gt;disconnected the points inside the distributor and manually grounded the
&gt;terminal inside the distributor and SPARK!  Yea, that eliminates the coil,
&gt;correct?
