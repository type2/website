Subject: Re: [T2] Did a Bay Really Have to Die?

&gt;&gt;It's always sad to see one leave the road for good.  Having said that ...


&gt;just an addendum to that, I was watching the news the other night and they
&gt;were covering the Lake Tahoe fire and as they paned the camera along some
&gt;houses there sat a Bay still smouldering from the flames, based on where
&gt;it was located in the driveway etc. I suspect it was on the road and just
&gt;wasn't able to escape...  

dayum, I don't even know 'em, nor did I hear about a burning bus (although I haven't talked to Mike yet. . .it wasn't sahara beige was it?) .  I live 1/2 mile from ground zero, fortunately the wind blew the fire the other way, my buses were in the driveway while I was off in San Diego for the weekend, flew back early to a lot of smoke but I was lucky, unlike some friends. . .
