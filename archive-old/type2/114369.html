Subject: spare FI connector

Does anyone have a FI connector like this they could spare and send me?

I should have taken one from the junkyard on my last trip but I couldn't bring myself to ruin two in tact FI harnesses just for one connector so I left them for someone in need.

Has anyone bought the male connector from anywhere?
