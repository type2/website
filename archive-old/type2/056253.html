&gt;Hi
&gt;        Having just acquired my first bus(76 camper) in 17 years
&gt;(previously had a 71 and 67 bus), and wanting to do all my own maintenance
&gt;as I used to, I've struck a bit of a problem finding correct info for the
&gt;timing. After consulting Muir, Bently, VW shops, and various www sites I've
&gt;come up with somewhere between 7.5BTDC and 5ATDC for my 2 litre MANUAL
&gt;trans motor(CJ). From what I can work out most of the 76 2 litre engines in
&gt;the US were auto trans(7.5 BTDC) but here in Australia there were also
&gt;manuals , which some info suggests should be 5ATDC. I have never worked on
&gt;anything over 1600 previously so any help would be much appreciated.

My 76 2 litre with Manual tranny still has the factory sticker on the
fan housing it says 7.5 BTDC (at 850 RPM if I remember correctly)
I'm an Aussie too in Perth
Stephen Foster is another Aussie but he's got a P76 V8 in his bus

 and I'd be interested in any info
&gt;regarding good reliable places to buy pistons, barrels,etc either here in
&gt;Australia or the US ( or anywhere else for that matter). Prices in this
&gt;country tend to be to far over the top at times so I'm open to suggestions.
Agreed maybe we should try and group - buy or ship some stuff possibly
