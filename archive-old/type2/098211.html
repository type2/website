Subject: Re: [T2] 79 showroom westfalia with bad engine please help.

[...]Have the shop that you pulled into do a
compression test to find out if it is valves, or
rings, if the engine was just done it could have air
leaks between the head and cylendars, curse the bad
luck, that is what I have on mine(80 F.I.) and I'm
having to do it all over again. Fixing yours long
distance is going to be hard, good luck with it. Phil
