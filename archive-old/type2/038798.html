We hit the road and it still took us 9 hours to get
to Everybus! And we thought we were gonna *miss* &quot;rush
hour.&quot; (Good question, Dave -- why *do* they call it
that when all you do is sit there?)

Nikki,

There really is never a point when you *miss* rush
hour, just faster traffic. It seems like it's always
rush hour around the Baltimore/Washington area!

They call it that because your blood is what's
rushing!  That and your left leg gets really tired if
you drive a manual tranny...
