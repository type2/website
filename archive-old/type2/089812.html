Subject: air scoops

I was thinking of purchasing a pair of aftermarket air scoops  for my 71 
westy, i was just wondering if they are worth it, ie.. has anyone used these 
and seen significant results in cooling? my bus doesnt overheat now,  it was 
just a nice preventative maintnance idea for the summer.. any input and past 
experiences would be appreciated .. thanks.. peace.. scott 71 vesty
