Subject: '71 bus-smokey &amp; won't start

        I have been off the list for a few months but I am now back, for a 
while atleast.  I need some help.  Ok, first of all, I walked out to the 
garage last thursday, and the cab of my bus was filled with smoke, my dad 
and I rolled it out into the driveway and cleared the smoke.  I put the 
key in and tried to start it but the key would not turn.  That afternoon, 
when I got home, I tried it again, and the key turned, the engine ws 
turning over, but it would not start.  We noticed that the head lights 
would only work when the key was turned but the parking lights and 
blinkers were working as usual.  After further examination, we discovered 
a burned wire under the dash.  There are supposedly only 5 wires that go 
to the switch where the fuses are, but mine had 6 connected.  The sixth 
one which wasn't connected to anything on the other side was the one that 
was burnt(my dad knows more about the electrical stuff then I do, so I am 
relaying what he has told me, I am still in the stages of learning basic 
repair, so that is my excuse for sounding like I don't really know what I 
am talking about).  If anyone has any clue as to what we should check, or 
has had this problem and knows why it won't start, or any info that might 
help us, it would be greatly appreciated.  We have studied the &quot;Idiot's 
Guide&quot; and checked the engine, and everything seems to look like it is 
working fine, except it still won't start.  Oh yeah, I changed the spark 
plugs, wires, distributor cap, and roter about two weeks ago, and it had 
been working fine, the last thing that had been done to it before the 
smoke was that I had gotten gas that day, drove home, and parked. It was 
the next morning that I discovered the smoke.           Thanks,  Dallas
