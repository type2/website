Brother Dolan's analysis was fine except for the conclusion and the 
explanation for the underlying phenomenon. If his math is correct, it would 
appear that it would require three strands of 16 guage wire (1.37 
ohms/1000') to more than equal a 12 guage wire (1.67 ohms/1000') and 4 
strands of 16 guage wire (1.03 ohms/1000') to almost equal a 10 guage wire 
(1.02 ohms/1000'), instead of the 4 and 5 strands, respectively, that he 
concluded.
But conceptually I was troubled by his statement about the resistive losses 
in copper wires having to do with electrons getting lost and converted to 
heat:..&quot;Lots of them don't make it from the alternator/generator to the 
battery, they get lost as heat&quot;.
In fact, no electrons are lost due to resistance in a wire, nor are they 
converted to heat. Rather they all arrive at the other end but with less 
ability to do work (e.g., at a reduced voltage due to a voltage drop that is 
equal to current x wire resistance). That energy lost in the wire is 
expressed as heat, and the potential (to do work) at the far end has been 
thus reduced.
Otherwise the analysis is right on, and much appreciated.
