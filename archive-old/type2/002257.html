Nikki,

Comprehensive deductable is customarily waived when an animal is involved.
Double check with your insurance man, and then call a couple of others.
Threaten to go to another company immediately after they settle with you if
necessary.

&gt; Aaaah-haa-haa! Thanks, Michael Benthin! I never woulda thunk to ask.
&gt;
&gt; I just got off the phone with my insurance company, and the
&gt; comprehensive coverage WILL cover the repairs to Wendelin, minus my $250
&gt; deductible.
