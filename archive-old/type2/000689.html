A car took down a power line a block away from the shop early this morning,
and the resulting power outage and surge put us out largely of commission
for most of the day. (By uncanny coincidence, a completely unrelated power
outage left our house powerless simultaneously!)  So there may be minor
delays on orders placed/shipped this week.  Tomorrow (Fri.) we're back to
normal, thanks to a very supportive Compaq Computer Corp. who offered to
overnight us replacements for the damaged parts (under warranty, no less,
and at no freight charge to boot!). Our fax line may be intermittant until
Satuday.
Sorry for any inconvenience.  Meanwhile, I'm on my way home to eat 10 pounds
of meat that have been defrosting in my freezer for the last 8 hours. :-)
