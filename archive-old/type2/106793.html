Subject: Accelerator Cable Problems

Hi,
It's been a while since I've been on the list but I
have an annoying dilemma I felt you might be able to
help me with.
Today I was driving my 77 bus after its tune-up and it
was running well when the pedal suddenly got ALOT
looser and the revs dropped considerably.
I pulled over and inspected the linkage &amp; carbs and
the accelerator cable was quite loose.
There was decent pull through 1st &amp; 2nd gear but as
more fuel was needed to get a real rise in 3rd the bus
was a little sluggish and when I took it out on a
local highway to try &amp; get up to about 100kmh(65mph)
it really took its time.
I rang the mechanic who originally built the engine
and asked for a few tips and he suggested checking the
cable by loosening the allen screw that holds it in
and tightening it up by this means if possible.
I did just that &amp; now the bus won't even start.
I thought it was flooded as it would half fire the
first time I attempted to start it &amp; then not respond
at all when I tried again.
It's a 2.0litre twin carb model and I just can't make
out what's the problem.
I've had no problem at all running engines uninstalled
in a vehicle without the cable in the past.
Any hints?
I don't really want to have to drag it to the local
mechanic on a tow truck when the answer should be so
simple.
:o)
Cheers &amp; God Bless
