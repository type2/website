Subject: RE: [T2] Brazilian VW Bus

Yes, you would get a title, but it would not be legal either. No
problem for old vehicles (for which the title got lost) but a lot of
Californian Hot Rod and Custom shops got in trouble for using
companies like Broadway title because their cars were not as old in
reality as the titles pretended. Same problem would apply to get a
1970s title date for a new Brazilian bus.

VIN swapping is illegal and not easy on a bus. Dashboard and door jam
sticker are, but the VIN is also stamped into the body in the engine
compartment close to the ignition coil position (on a late bay). When
German inspectors see welds close to this number or evidence of
grinding in this area you can start thinking about which jail you
would like to do your time in. I suspect that you may face similiar
consequences in this country. Only difference is that you are less
likely to come across someone who has both the knowledge and the
authority to cause you problems in this country.

The Mexi beetles were legal because they never touched the chassis and
the VIN and simply used a new &quot;parts&quot; car for restoration.

Quoting type2-digest-help_at_type2_dot_com:

&gt; service in one of theses sates.
