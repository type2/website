I don't think this made it to the list earlier, but I apologize if it did:

&gt; Actually we would have described it as the &quot;Cow Poop Edition&quot;.
&gt; 

I too have a '78 Champagne Edition (didn't know it when 
I bought it) and my first reaction was &quot;Gee, it looks 
like a big t*rd&quot;.  It didn't help that when a PO had 
repainted it, they used bright white above the beltline 
instead of the proper Pastel White.  Actually it looks 
much better after I buffed the Agate Brown out to a good 
gloss.

I have a factory advertisement for the Champagne 
Edition.  If anyone is interested in seeing it, I can 
post it up on a website.
