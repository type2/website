'77 Westy with type 4 engine 2.0, new rebuild by AVP, 4k miles, original
fuel injection system, use mid grade 89 or 90 octane, change oil every
750 miles, check oil every morning before starting. Tune up every 1000
miles. 

Prior to the new engine I averaged about 55-60 mph on the highway. 
Since new engine I average about 65-70mph on the highway, if it is very
hot, above 85f, then I keep it around 55-60.  This engine is so powerful
that I have to really pay attention or else I find myself doing 75+ on
level highway. 

It runs relatively cool, when returning from my trip to Minnesota, we
started driving at about 9am, and didn't stop longer than to fill up a
couple times all day. It was relatively hot in the mid 80's, when we
reached the rest area at Monteagle TN, after the much steeper climb of
traveling north to south, I pulled in. The engine was a little warm,
meaning unlike the other stops that day I could not rest my hand atop
the fan housing for more than a few seconds without some discomfort.  So
I left the engine hatch up and decided it was a good time to play with
Puck (a 11 month old golden labrahoundador) 15 minutes of &quot;stick&quot; and
check the engine. Cool enough to rest hand and off we went.

Having completed a couple of long trips with the new engine now, I can
tell by the sound, the power, the feeling.. when it is running warm,
when it is a little low on oil, etc.  It is such a personal relationship
with my bus, I know it I think very well now, and I really don't let
anyone else drive it. Not out of not trusting them, but out of what I
just mentioned, I can perhaps sence a problem before it occurs. Sorry to
ramble...
