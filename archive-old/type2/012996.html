&gt;The question I have is this: 
&gt;Is there some type of material like Plasti-Gauge that can be used on the
&gt;top of the piston or outer raised portion to set up cylinder head spacing
&gt;and achieve balanced (or very close) compression?

modeling clay or play dough

Don't laugh folks, it's a good cheap trick, not all that accurate but it
will keep you safe.  Accuracy will depend on your measurment
technique, and I doubt you'll do better than 0.015-0.020 or so which is
about 3-4 cc a pretty hefty amount.

However a set of cheapo chinese depth mics, and a strap of  1&quot; x 1/4&quot;
bar stock with 2 holes drilled for caddy corner head studs, then a couple
of sockets and washers as spacers will set you back less than $30 and
provide results (by my rather extensive trials) nearly as good as my 1&quot;
thick deck plate provides with the dial gage.  The depth mic technique
setting it on the barrel beside the strap holding down the barrel will be
withing 0.005&quot; or so of what it is actually torqued home under a head.

As to hardness, that is interesting, a few years ago I did take a few heads
to the hardness tester and the AMCs at the time were as their rep quite
a bit softer than the VW heads, all square port heads I was testing.
