&gt; I've got a 2L sitting on a palette (sp?) 800 mi away from my location
&gt; and need some idea of it's weight before any shipping company will give
&gt; me a quote.  Has anyone had an engine shipped lately?  What did it
&gt; weigh?  (pounds will be fine)

I saved this info from STF a while back: complete T4 engine in shipping
crate weighs 411 lbs.

I'm pulling an engine tomorrow. Maybe if I can find a long enough strong
enough plank of wood I can figure it out myself using my known body weight.
