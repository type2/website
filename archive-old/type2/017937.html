I, too am pleased to see this thread as it makes us all more &quot;human&quot;, 
something needed in this ol world.

I am a special ed teacher of junior high school students (the ones that 
would really rather not be in a classroom) and have just put in a very 
difficult three weeks.  My kids are really &quot;freaked&quot; by the happenings in 
Colorado and Alberta.

Soooo working on the &quot;Magicbus&quot; (72, 1800 Weber progressive, 009) and 
getting her ready for summer has been a godsend!

See, busses are good for lots of stuff!
