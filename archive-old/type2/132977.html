Subject: Re: [T2] Roll Back Odometer , replacing engine....

Scott,

ummmmm quite a bit longer than an hour.  Let's say you have an odometer
at 77,000 miles and want to wind it 23,000 miles forward to zero.

Also, that your drill will make the speedo register 100mph...that would be
about 230 hours(9.5 days)  or so to get back to zero.

Don't ask me how I know this!&lt;grin&gt;

I really wanted my 78 to start at zero again, but really didn't have the
time either.  At &quot;44,000&quot; , it was almost as bad forward as backward and 
just wasn't worth it to me.

Cheers, dave

&gt; Trey,

&gt; Easier to just mark down the mileage.
&gt; 
&gt; But if you want to do it, attach an electric drill to the speedo drive, lock
&gt; it in the on position and let it spin for a good long while. Depending on
&gt; how many miles you need to add on to get back to zero, it might take an hour
&gt; or even longer, but it will work.
