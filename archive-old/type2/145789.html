Subject: Re: [T2] 15&quot; Wheels in front, 14&quot; in Rear

Hello Anton  Glad to hear you got the bus going now you need to come camping  
 The disc brake conversion ? was this using a disc set up from a later bus  
does the front rims have a different bolt pattern??   The later buses used a 
different rim  but I thought most of them were 14 in   Do you have disc brakes 
on the back also?   Pixs would do wonders .  I have some of the old bus rims 
that are 15 in if you need them .  later and have fun  Mark Dearing
