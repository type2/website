Subject: bus stops

Driving along yesterday I was thinking how well the bus was running
Then it missed and hesitated then resumed normally
It did the same this morning but stopped and then restarted and got me home
This afternoon it started, ran for ten seconds then stopped and would not
restart
(running on cold start valve?)
it is a 76 with Fuel injection
checking for power across the injector terminals  the test light flickered
when engine cranked
the fuel pump runs and appears to be supplying the cold start valve
fuel filter is new igniton wires, points plugs etc new
will start and run briefly again after 5-10 minutes of being left.

the road service guy thought it was the fuel pump and drenched himself in
petrol before suggesting a tow to the VW mechanic I dont think so ( it
wouldnt run on the cold start without fuel pressure would it)

Anyone with any idea please?

Jeff
