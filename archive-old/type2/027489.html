  It seems that when I advertised my 78 microbus yesterday, I forgot to 
include my location, so here's all the info again...

  78 standard bus, white over blue, needs new sunroof panel(all 
cables,etc.are good), has small rust through area under passenger 
windshield, needs a good valve job(no good local mechanics!).

  I purchased this bus 3 years ago from very caring 2nd owner,in San Diego, 
and brought her to the Oregon coast, she was my daily driver until about 2 
months ago.

asking price is $1500. time is a factor, I need to seel her fast, and would 
hate to have to salvage such a great old girl off... so price is slightly 
negotiable!

541-574-8764...ask for mike.
