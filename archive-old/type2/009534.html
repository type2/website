So,
If the neither the 009 nor the 050 provide the proper advance for the T4, what
would be the -most- perfect distributor for a T4 with a 2bbl Weber (provided
its got a vacuum nipple with enough draw-which i also had to plug).
TIA,

&gt;         The major difference in the 050 is that it doesn't retartd the
&gt; spark on #3, don't think there's all that much difference in the advance
&gt; curve -- at least it sure doesn't go nearly far enough, just like the
&gt; 009.  These are both dizzy's for the T1, upright engine, not for the T4.
&gt; 
&gt;           Why do you say the Weber progressive doesn't have a vacuum
&gt; port? Mine sure did, because I had to plug it. Somewhere here I've got a
&gt; Weber book, I'll look for it tonight. Do you know your carb model #??
