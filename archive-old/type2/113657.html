Subject: Re: [T2] Re; Powdercoating Rims

The local powdercoater told me to bring my parts bare naked clean and they 
would do the rest.

They showed me the process and it was simply coating the parts with powder 
and the baking at 400 degrees for about 10 minutes. Causes the powder to 
spread and flow like wet paint and then when it is cool it is there for 
good (unless you sandblast it again).

She (the owner) did not recommend powdercoating over old paint at all.

$40 for whatever the could get done in an hour. That works out to be about 
16 wheels or tin for 3 engines. Each color change constitutes another hour 
due to cleanup and restart. They are a small job shop.
