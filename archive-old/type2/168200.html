&gt; &gt; The biggest difference is that its illegal to burn kerosene in a

&gt; Probably true.  One state went after a fellow who was publicizing running
&gt; his vehicle on used french fry oil, saying that he had to document his
&gt; usage and pay road tax on the veggie oil he used in place of Diesel.

Kero and home heating oil are dyed, specifically, for the purpose of
catching those that might try to cheat the system.

And....multiple people in several states have been fine for the use of
veggie oil and biodiesel without paying OTR tax.  There was a recent,
very highly publicized of David Wetzel, a 79 year old man who was
running homemade biodiesel in his 86 VW.  Its a catch 22 because the
government will often not allow you to pay the tax on your use but,
will fine you once you have.
