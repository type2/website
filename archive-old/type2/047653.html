&gt; Do you know if they had to change major parts like the
&gt;  compressor in the R134A changeover?    Thanks.

It was done by an independent Volvo mechanic.  He said he installed a &quot;kit&quot; 
and it took him a little over an hour to do it.  He's done dozens of them 
with consistent, excellent results.  
I checked the stickers in the car and they have Volvo on them so I'd say he 
got the &quot;kit&quot; from the dealer.
I'm sure he didn't replace the compressor.
I hope this helps.
