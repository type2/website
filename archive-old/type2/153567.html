Subject: Re: [T2] Manure and buses are among promising areas for
  investment

Just a wild guess, but I think the bus's mentioned in the story are &quot;City
Bus's&quot;. Although the right amount of &quot;Manure&quot; put in the &quot;Right&quot; place might
just be the answer to a lot of problems!
