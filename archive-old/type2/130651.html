&gt;I am having new tires installed at Costco and they can't get the Lug Nuts off.  Said they had their torque wrench up to 330lbs and they would not budge.  What happened?  did the drums overheat causing them to freeze or something?

94 ft. lbs is standard. When was the last time the nuts were removed?

&gt;I busted 5 different lug wrenches with a 4 foot cheater bar trying to get them off.  Any suggestions?

Did you use a penetrating fluid?
