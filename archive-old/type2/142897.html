Subject: Re: [T2] So I call in sick to work on my bus..

&gt; The valves dwell in the closed position for several degrees of crank
rotation. Be sure they aren't really moving...

It was just my error...


&gt; Dashpot, chokes?

Dashpot's off again, chokes are fine.

Bizarre. I went out and fixed the leak (yep, I screwed up the valve
cover gasket somehow). Knocked the volume screws down 1/2 each. Idle
circuit back in play. I dunno why they would work fine for a while at
that setting then KAPUT!

But I still have no power. Even less if anything. Bucking like a
beast. I put the points back in to see if the new Pertronix was the
problem. Nope. I'm inside taking a break now. I'm going to go out and
completely readjust the carbs from the beginning. Sigh.
