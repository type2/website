&gt; Apparently these should be reconfigured with guides, seats, springs,

&gt; them
&gt; already assembled this way?

They are made in Spain and imported. Bus Depot and other sell them.

Some come with valves, springs etc from the factory and some are fit  
by one of the local importers using whatever parts they prefer at the  
time. The last time I asked, the valves were coming from Italy.

While the AMC castings are top notch, the valves and parts used are  
not the best quality.

I would tear down any complete AMC head and inspect the parts before  
installation.

One known issue is that the valve keepers do not fit right and can  
cause premature head failure.

&gt; (3) Buy NOS (never installed) heads from a german supplier that come
&gt; without valves and springs. I remember I've read about the AMC heads
&gt; being superior casted. Will this make any difference to NOS ones?

Riechert heads are usually the 1.8L variety:
