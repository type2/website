Subject: Re: [T2] RE: Tow Dolly

I towed a manual westy for 400 miles with the front wheels on a tow dolly
...no problem - I just kept the speed to 45MPH maximum - I traveled during
the night too so as to cause less hassle to other freeway users.  I think
raising the rear wheels onto the dolly would make the van track across the
road unless you can figure a way to lock the front wheels into position ~ I
can't see why you would want to tow that way in the first place though ...-
Think of it like this ...The bus is designed to travel with the rear wheels
last!

If its an auto. bus then its different ... &amp; I've no experience there.
