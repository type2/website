X-Virus-Scanned: Symantec AntiVirus Scan Engine
Subject: Re: [T2] Friday Odd Thoughts

Mark I see your point....I guess if you go to the junkyard you might say
&quot;hmmm that bus has a good engine, I could rebuild it as a spare for my bus&quot;.
I guess the next guy that comes along says...&quot;hmmm that bus could be brought
back, just needs an engine&quot;. haha

The engine I have &quot;in the box&quot; to be rebuilt fortunately came from a bus
that was going to the crusher the next week, so I gave the guy $200 for
everything I could pull off or out in 2 days. I got most everything!!! They
had to drag the poor bust up on the truck, but it's spirit will live on in
my bus, once I get the engine rebuilt.
