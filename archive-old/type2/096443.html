Subject: Re: [T2] Even More FI Rich/Lean Questions


3 words folks, Bentley, Bentley, Bentley.

Page 11 of the FI section of the green Bentley(buses).

The pressure regulator is just that, a device that is supposed to keep the 
pressure in the fuel rail at about 35psi with the vacuum hose 
disconnected(33-37 is considered acceptable).

If the fuel ring pressure is lower, then you *might* be running lean(less 
fuel through the injector for a given opening time).  If the pressure in the 
fuel ring is higher, then you *might* run a little rich...


Bentley says...the reason for the vacum adj on the pressure regulator is 
so that it drops the pressure on the fuel rail while idling(important for 
emmisions).....lower fuel ring pressure...less gas injected at the same 
injector time openings.

So....High vacuum(idle)=less pressure in the fuel rail.
      Low vacuum(wide open throttle)=more pressure in the fuel rail.

All of this completely ignores what the ECU might be doing to the 
injector timing because of hot or cold conditions and rpm.

If you have a fuel pressure gauge and a vacuum tool, try it out.

One more note....if the pressure is less than 35 at full throttle, then 
you may(as Bentley puts it....lack power).

There are people out there that sell adjustable pressure regulators that 
adjust the pressure to be even higher at lower vacuum.

Cheers, dave

&gt; Why does the L-Jetronic fuel pressure regulator in my bus sample the air 
&gt; input manifold pressure?
&gt; 
&gt; If the vacuum line to the regulator is removed and blocked would the engine 
&gt; run richer? Would the vacuum drop.
&gt; 
&gt; Is the differential pressure at the injector tip the signed sum of the air 
&gt; manifold pressure and the fuel manifold pressure?
&gt; 
&gt; Is the differential pressure at the injector tip held constant by the fuel 
&gt; pressure regulator control loop?
&gt; 
&gt; If the differential pressure is held constant would fuel delivery per 
&gt; injection pulse be affected by changes in manifold pressure?
&gt; 
&gt; Is the function of the fuel pressure control loop to control the 
&gt; differential pressure at the injector tip?
