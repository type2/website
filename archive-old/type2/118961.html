Subject: Re: [T2] CHEEP BUSES

Howdy,

That's frightening. What did you put in for $5000 while the beast is still
not running? I bought a 72 Westy for $400cdn with a rough  body and estimate
to spend not more than $1.500 to bring her on the road. Being a dreamer in
this case, I hope not. She is running well and have even a gas heater. Like
your input in this case.
