Subject: Re: Westfalia (and other) side tents.....

Fred...

I'm not exactly sure what these side tents look like, but I presume they
aren't to sleep in, but really just a vestibule that attaches to the side
of the bus.  Is this correct?

I guess I'd like to find/invent a vestibule that is just large enough to
cook in and still protect you from wind/precip.

Are there any pics on the net that illustrate the side tents that have
been the talk of the town recently?  Or perhaps pictures of what side
tents are currently available for a 71 campmobile?

I need some conceptual help here:)

Cheers,

Tom
