&lt;&lt; The part number I'm looking for (73-79) is:

411 845 235.  From what I can find out, it's NLA. If RTV is what everyone's

using, I'll follow suit.  The rope stuff, between the housing and the lens,

is no big deal...you can get something close at the hardware store. &gt;&gt;

You might try

They might have a 'generic' rubber gasket to cut to fit...
