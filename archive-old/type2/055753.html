Just moved to the Denver area from Phoenix; took four years to finally get the
carb jetting right for the heat etc.  Here I go again!  Anyone have any tips
on jetting a 1600 dp bus motor with 30PICT carb for high altitude?  Any
thoughts on timing as well?  We are experiencing withdrawal symptoms from
leaving our AZ Bus Club family/friends--anyone know of any Colorado based VW
Clubs?

Thanks in advance for any info,
Buck Wilde
