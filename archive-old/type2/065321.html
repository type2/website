Subject: Re: Timing Setting

&gt;I replaced the points with an electronic system (Ignitor).  It was
&gt;pretty easy, but now it seems to hesitate at low rpms, even after
&gt;it's warmed up.  I set the timing staticly, per Muir.
&gt;
&gt;I have a 65 panel van.  The engine block is a type III, but it has
&gt;most of the parts where they are supposed to go (upright fan, etc.).
&gt;I'm pretty sure about the type III business, as the block number is
&gt;U0322513, there is no tap for the oil pressure sender, and the
&gt;dipstick has the bolt-on neck on the side.  According to Muir,
&gt;this means 0 deg for the timing.  It's also got a Bosch 009, and
&gt;a Solex 34 PICT 3 for the carb.
&gt;
&gt;Any suggestions?  Does the block dictate the timing, or do the
&gt;various components override this?  Also, are there any benefits to
&gt;having this block in a bus?  Any disadvantages?

        I dunno much, but I know this: static timing, while functional, is
not going to get top performance. Full advance on a statically timed engine
seems to run about 25-27 degrees, in my experience, and you can go up to 32
on a 1600, or so they say. I'm sure that if there is a difference between
timing on a type III and a type I or II I'll be mailbombed by rabid VW
supporters. ;-) I run my engines at about 31 degrees-at full advance-and
the oil runs about 180 degrees fairenheit. In Texas. Where its hot. HOT.
*HOT*. But, you say, I don't have a bitchin' sano kewl $$$$ timing lite
with computer chip advancing. Hear the gospel brother-ye need it not. Check
out Hoovers sermons-linked from my home page, url in sig below(shameless
plug)-to see the &quot;light&quot;(shameless pun) on how to make a $30 inductive
timing light a bitchin' sano kewl $$$$ timing lite, with just a little of
the old algebra you tried so hard to forget in high school. Ok, maybe it's
not chrome plated with pictures of bimbos, but it'll time your engine and
leave enough dough for a beer Friday night at the bar...

Peace,
