I hear you Jason, but you are missing my point. Because of all the 
mickey-mousing, something could go wrong just because of the stand 
test, or between the stand test and the final R&amp;R.

Moreover, for a one-time builder, I suspect that it takes no more time 
to drop the engine again than it takes to assemble all the wiring and 
the fuel ring (take the double relay and pressure regulator off the 
firewall, take the fuel pump out, put those things back), set up a 
means for starting, and all that. What about the alternator? Does the 
circuit need to be complete in order to keep from destroying it? And so 
on.
