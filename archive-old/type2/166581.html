Subject: Re: [T2] 73 Bus - Paint Job Recommendations?

I just did this...if you really want to do it right
there are two steps:

Prep:  This takes way more work than painting if you
do it right. You can actually do this yourself if you
have the time and patience. You'll want to remove all
exterior parts and trim, including windows and window
seals to get at any rust. Prep minor rust using a rust
converter, and replace any seriously rusted panels.
Remove any body dings by hammering and/or bondo. Sand
it all smooth.

Prime (if bare metal) and paint with good-quality
auto-paint:  Probably best to get this done by a
larger auto-body shop.  I tried a fly-by-night VW
guy...he didn't do some of the things he was supposed
(what he did, he did well though).


This will cost $5K-8K if you farm it all out, and does
not include the interior of the bus. A full-vehicle
inside and out, teardown to bare metal paint job will
run $20K+ (you need to have a VW pro do this, there
are several in LA).

If you want to go really cheap, you can just get it
sanded and repainted for $500-1500. This will not
address any rust issues under the rubber or trim, but
if you have good metal it will protect it for a few
years. 

A DITY paint-brush job will look horrible and peel off
soon, If you need to DITY at least use rattle-cans
(will look somewhat less horrible
