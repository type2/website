Subject: Re: dropped valve seat

&gt; pulled the 1/2 head yesterday.  exhaust manifold was tough to remove.
&gt; even if i had never heard of a dropped valve seat i could have
&gt; guessed that is what happened by looking at the head after i removed
&gt; it.  the #1 intake valve was sitting cocked on the seat which was
&gt; jammed about half in half out of the port.

jeremiah,

As a lurker here, I may have missed part of this, but it always catches my
attention when I see the words &quot;dropped valve seat&quot;  I own an 81 AC vanagon,
and as I am around 200K miles, I have a concern about such a thing. Don't
have a cht gauge, nor $120 to buy one with :-) but I take care on long mt
passes, and generally pay close attention to lugging the motor, and keeping
from stressing it for too long, or too much.

Anyway, I am wondering why you pulled the head. Did you know about the seat
going in? If so, what do you suppose happened? Mostly, just always curious
to hear other's experiences that lead to such a problem.

If you have the time, or the inclination, would you expand a bit on how you
got to where you are now?

Thanks a lot,

John
