Since my father was a plumber I was taught the proper use of the &quot;pipe
wrench&quot; and have not damaged a nut in many years, the only damage on my
current axle nut was via PO and I have had it off several times.  I put my
cotter pin in with my fingers.   but I agree that like all tools must be
used correctly or one is not only likely to damage a part, but also
ones'self.
