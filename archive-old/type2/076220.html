Subject: Alternator??  And Bus is running!!

My bus is running now!! woohoo.

Bus: 1978 type 4 2.0 engine.  New injectors, cold
start valve, all vacuum lines, all fuel hose, fuel
pump, intake gasket.

Symptons:  Generator light stays lit all the time.  I
drove it to town thinking something else was causing
the light to be one and it dies 6 miles into the
trip!!  Battery dead.  Get friend to bring charged
battery and it runs again.

Question?  test the alternator? regulator? replace
alternator? regulator?  How?  Anybody have any secrets
to getting the alternator out if it turns out it is
bad?  Have bentley and haynes for testing and
diagrams, etc.

Reputable rebuilders?  anybody know of any that can
take the alternator through the mail, or does anybody
know of one local to me.  Roanoke, Blacksburg, VA.

Thanks for all the help.  Bus runs great now!  Thanks
to everybody's help here.
