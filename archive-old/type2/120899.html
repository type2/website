Subject: R: [T2] BAttery drain

Switch everything off, put a 12V light bulb  (like the dome light bulb)
between the ground strap battery clamp and the battery ground pole (don't
worry: you won't be electrocuted!).
If the light shines then you have a drain somewere! Be aware that it can
light up veeeery slightly if you have things like clocks or digital radios
on your dash, as they need some juice to keep the time and memory.

If you realize you have a drain, try taking off the fuses one at a time to
find out which circuit line is the culprit.
