Subject: Trouble along the way...  Part 3: Trial, relief, triumph

The Great Homeward Expedition and Solo Wetwesties (y?) Moveable Feast 
(Picnic?)

I can't begin to thank Jim Arnott and Pat Owen enough for dropping their 
Saturday plans, packing Jim's rig full of tools and parts, and driving 100 
miles over the Blue Mountains to come to my aid.  Although Jim and I have 
corresponded by e-mail for a long time, we'd never actually met.  Pat didn't 
know me from the man in the moon, but an air-cooled VW was in trouble and that 
was apparently all the motivation he needed.

It was a tough moment when Jim and Pat headed back to Union at 3:00PM  and I 
cranked up my sick old bus and started for home.

I headed North on US 395 to Hermiston and the Grand Auto store that Jim and 
Pat had mentioned.  I was really sweating this leg, because it was farther 
than I'd anticipated and I was getting low on my reserve of oil.  I quickly 
discovered (re-discovered is probably more accurate) that the VW would pull 
fairly well at relatively low revs in 4th gear, even with only 3 holes 
working.  I putted along between 35 and 40MPH in 4th, and this dramatically 
reduced the smokescreen volume.  The few times I had to get into 3rd or 2nd 
the smoke was really thick, and pretty scary too.

Based on the 2 qts. per 5 miles oil loss Friday afternoon, I bought 4 cases of 
their El Cheapo 30w oil, topped off the crankcase (it was down 1 qt. already 
since the Pilot parking lot) and headed N. on 395 toward the 395/730/I-82 
junction at the Columbia River.  By the time I reached the 395/730 junction 
I'd already chickened out on trying 
I-82 N. over the Horse Heaven Hills into the Yakima Valley.  The power just 
didn't seem to be there, and I'd already had some scary moments with local 
yahoos in pickups playing games with me.

I stopped every few miles to check the oil level, because I wanted to keep it 
topped up and not wait for the dreaded flickering oil light, etc.  It seemed 
to be holding up pretty well at the 35-40 pace as long as I used 4th and kept 
the revs low.  At the 395/730 junction there was NO Eastbound traffic, and 
it's a river-level route to the Tri-Cities and the Yakima Valley, so I turned 
right and headed toward Wallula WA and points North and West.  Things went 
surprisingly smoothly, but I kept an ear on the mill, an eye on the oil light 
and prayed a LOT.  At the Oregon/Washington line it was down 1/3 qt. and I 
topped up.  This was a big surprise, as it was over 20 miles since the Grand 
Auto in Hermiston.  So, as Lewis and Clark were wont to say in their journals, 
&quot;we proceeded on&quot;.

Traffic was light into the Tri-Cities and I just stuck with the highway which 
became US 12 and then I-182 through Pasco and Kennewick.  Even on 2-lane 730 
and 12 the shoulders were wide, smooth, and clean so when threatened by 
bullies or behemoths I simply held my pace and hit the shoulder.  The pace 
crept up as my confidence in managing the oil loss grew, and we seemed to hit 
a comfortable stride at about 45 MPH in 4th.  I stopped a few times for oil 
checks/additions so I wouldn't face the glaring red eye in the middle of a 
bridge or interchange.  The oil loss closely correlated with the engine revs 
and the grunt factor, but I seemed to be making around 25 to 30 miles/qt.  
through this relatively level going.

There were no opportunities to get away from the freeway to secondary roads 
til Prosser, so I stayed with I-82.  A couple of humps had me down to 3rd, and 
the oil loss rate went way up as shown by the enormous smoke cloud.  But at 
Prosser the freeway flattened out and I decided to stick with it to Yakima.  
It also seemed like a good bet that we'd actually get that far.  I added 2 
qts. at Prosser, but that still worked out to about 5 qts. in 93.4 miles since 
the Pilot truck stop, much better than anticipated.

I got to Yakima at 7:30PM, 4 1/2 hours to go 144 miles.  1 1/4 qts. oil from 
Prosser to Yakima.  I stopped for a sandwich and phoned my wife to discuss 
route options.  I eventually determined that the old highway through the 
Yakima River Canyon to Ellensburg and Snoqualmie Pass is still closed by 
reconstruction, so that eliminated Snoqualmie Pass.  The I-82 route to 
Ellensburg and I-90 has really wicked grades over the Saddle Mountains, and I 
didn't want to take the risk.  

That left US 12 over White Pass, a long and roundabout way back to Tacoma, or 
WA 410 over Chinook Pass, the route I'd come over Friday.  Chinook is nearly 
6,000 feet, most gained in the last 20 miles or so, but it's the shortest way 
home.  And as commercial traffic isn't allowed (it passes through Mt. Rainier 
Nat. Park) and it was late Sat. evening I'd have the route pretty much to 
myself so slow travel with frequent oil stops shouldn't be a problem.  My only 
serious concern was if the bus had enough steam left, in ANY gear, to keep it 
moving up that last steep stretch.

I gassed up in Yakima, and left at 8:55PM.  There're lots of Nat. Forest 
campgrounds on the Chinook Pass route, so I planned to stop and sleep if the 
bus or I ran out of steam.  When I reached the US 12/WA 410 junction at Naches 
WA there was a bunch of big rigs heading both W. and E. on White Pass, which 
is also a narrow and twisty 
2-lane road like Chinook Pass.  That clinched the decision.  The next 44 miles 
at 35-40MPH ate 2 qts. of oil.  The next 9 miles a pint, then 10 miles and 1 
qt., 6 miles and a qt., and I was on top at 11:36PM.  

Seventy miles from Yakima in 2 hours 41 minutes, but the last 7 miles took 
30 minutes!  I crawled up that stretch at 15MPH in 2nd, but power wasn't an 
issue after all.  I could have driven faster, though still in 2nd, but the oil 
loss rate would have been unmanageable.  

What a joy to be on top!  The sky was crystal clear, starlight so bright you 
could make out detail on nearby Mt. Rainier, and a soft COLD breeze smelling 
of heather.  I wish I could have stayed, but with traffic non-existent, and 
only 70 all downhill miles to home, I needed to &quot;proceed on&quot;.  

When Elvis started jogging back and forth across the road in front of the bus 
I knew I was on my last legs, so to speak, but frequent oil checks and the 
near-freezing temperature inside the bus kept me reasonably alert/awake.  No 
heat.  I tried it once, and in seconds the fumes were so thick I thought I had 
a fire.

After being passed on freeway shoulders, etc., in broad daylight, by hundreds 
of &quot;motorists&quot;, including several Type 2 drivers, as I peered into the 
smoke-filled engine room, and never a hint of concern for a fellow traveler 
(the strange sound is Joe McCarthy spinning in his tomb), at a 1:00AM (Sunday) 
oil check stop in Enumclaw WA a couple of local teen yahoos in a monster 4wd 
truck flipped a squirrely u-turn in the middle of the highway and roared up 
beside me.  I expected trouble, but instead got a friendly and genuinely 
concerned offer of assistance.  Only one of the whole trip.  

I finally limped to my house at 2:05AM Sunday morning.  289.8 miles.  13 
quarts of dead dinosaur juice.  11 hours and 5 minutes overall from the 
Stanfield OR &quot;Pilot Travel Center&quot; to Tacoma WA.  Desperate men in desperate 
times take desperate measures.  Or something like that, I'm too tired to 
remember.

There is absolutely no way I could have driven the bus home without the help 
of Jim Arnott and Pat Owen.  3 cylinders was iffy enough, 2 1/2 or 2 was out 
of the question and that's clearly what I had until they re-adjusted the 
valves. 

It ain't over yet, but the Campmobile is in the engine builder's carpark.  I 
have the keys, and the engine lid's locked.  He reiterated on the phone today 
his certainty that there's no hole in the piston, and I determinedly countered 
with a stack of evidence to the contrary.  Tomorrow AM I'll crank it up myself 
and oil down his driveway and smoke up his shop.  I told him the engine would 
be disassembled in my presence, PERIOD.  Could be an interesting week 
ahead.....
