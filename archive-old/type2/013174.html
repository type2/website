I'm &quot;into&quot; the square port heads only because I have only Vanagons
at the moment and because I have a set of NOS German round ports in
case I ever need round ports again.

Frankly the square port heads crack a lot worse than the round
for some reason.  This may be because they are mostly running
around in much heavier vanagons.  I have a set of '79 heads in
fact 029 p/n heads that are about 125k mile heads and look like
any other 2.0 bus head as far as cracks etc.

This is something people don't always realize BTW, there are '79
ONLY heads, they are a 029 p/n and have the regular 37.5 and 33mm
size bus FI 2.0 valve sizes.  All 071 p/n Vanagon square ports that
I have at least including AMC heads use the 39 and 33mm 1.7 valve
sizes.

Benefits of square port heads, well they use a regular exhaust gasket,
not the evil copper ring.  But they do seem to crack around the exhaust
ports faster, odd as there is more metal under the port down there,
perhaps because there is more metal, perhaps because they are
mostly shoving around 4500 pound Vanagons, who knows.

In your case, if you lived in a non-smogged area and could switch to
them, I'd look at these if they go for something in the $350ish area,
bearing in mind that you can get an AVP rebuild of ?? quality for
$190 each, but that a new AMC head may be no better.
