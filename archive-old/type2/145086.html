Subject: Re: Hurricane Wilma 

Hi! I too live in South Florida. Although, my bus was in the garage so it emerged unscathed.

I have a friend who is seriosuly considering looking for a camper. He plans to retire in a couple of years, and wants to have a VW Bus that he can drive around the country. What he really really wants is a Weekender. He really likes the interior of a Westfalia, but doesn't want the massive fiberglass top. 

I told him that some Busses came with Rag tops in the center, and that most Westfalias were simply ragtop busses that had been converted prior to shipping (am I right?). 

He also really wants to have the massive moon roof... so buying a neglected Westfalia, converting it into a Weekender with a rag top is really looking like a good option for him.

If someone WAS to actually have a Westfalia and wanted to install the large moonroof hardware on it, where would you get it from and how difficult is it to install? Does it require any modifications to the body? or does it simply all bolt in?



Thanks!!!

Todd

&gt;
&gt;Hello all:
&gt;
&gt;I live in Miami and Hurricane Wilma removed my camper
&gt;top and place it somewhere in Miami. I'm still looking
&gt;for it, haven't found it. 
&gt;
&gt;All I have left are twisted brackets on my roof, this
&gt;raises a question, where can I find a complete camper
&gt;top, brackets and all?
&gt;
&gt;Or shoud I go ragtop? -- an idea
