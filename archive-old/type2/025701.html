Hi Volks,

In order to finance the &quot;Westification&quot; of Das Über-Kamper, I have decided
to part with one of my most treasured pick-a-part finds: A pair of
good-condition defroster boost fans (AKA &quot;Ambulance Fans&quot;).

See them at: http://www.geocities_dot_com/vw_type2/defrosters/

These have been tested and proven functional by yours truly, and were pulled
from a 77 Westy only three weeks ago.

My main objective this winter is to complete the &quot;Westification Project&quot; and
drive Das Über-Kamper to meet some of you at EveryBus 2001 this April. But
I'm going to need some extra $$$ to make that happen; and I am certain that
someone out there may need these more than me. Someone with $$$, perhaps.

Make me an offer, I'll let you know by Monday. BTW, I'm willing to ship
these anywhere if the seller pays shipping.

Happy trails,

Greg Potts
