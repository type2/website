Subject: Re: [T2] Starter Dummy!

not a dummy at all just never changed the starter ...
its on the right hand side of the top of the engine behind the middle of where a carb would sit...
its like 15 mm or 17mm i think ,...
if you can find the accelerator cable comeing through the back of the engine skirt its down and to the right a bit...
big nub sticking out there!
happy fathewrs day back to you..

&gt;I am completely embarrassed to admit it, but I can't get the starter off my
&gt;72. I was told that there is a long bolt that goes thru to the engine
&gt;compartment, but where? I have looked everywhere for it with no luck? Can
&gt;someone please point me in the right direction? Thank you in advance.

&gt;Happy Fathers Day to all you Dad's out there, enjoy!
