&gt; A suggestion on how to improve the archives would be to include some of

With the current version of the archives there is no easy way to make this
happen.

A lot of time has been put into a new version, but Real Life(tm) tends to
get in the way of the development.

The latest edition would be similar to:

..but I've found a few flaws in my design since then that need to be
readdressed.  (gb-users has around 6000 messages in it...if memory serves
we've got closer to 500,000 in the combined archives for v_at_l, vb_at_t2, and

There has been thought put into this.  As memory serves, the decision was
made to /not/ use such services (including gmane, mail-archive, etc as

If you'd like to volunteer to handle some portion of the work, and you
have experiance with mhonarc or mnogosearch, feel free to email me
offlist).


In the meantime, a BIG THANKS goes out to Matt Roberds for all of the time
and effort he's put into the archives as they stand!  Without his work
we wouldn't have any searchable archives!
