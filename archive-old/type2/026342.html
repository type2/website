	In response to what Grant said:


I'm thinking that because the water is more efficient at soaking up heat,
you could have a smaller cooler near the engine where there is room for it,
and where the oil doesn't have to travel far, and then the  water
circulation could go through big 3/4 or 1 inch tubes pumped by an
inexpensive bilge pump, basically eliminating any flow restrictions.
You could control the temperature either by putting a mechanical thermostat
in the oil line, as is done with a normal oil cooler, and/or by  putting a
thermostatic switch on the water circulation pump.  Simple!

I too have been thinking about the previous thread for about a week now.  I
have been wondering about the added heat created by putting air conditioning
on an air-cooled motor.  It's almost as bad as towing behind your bus(the
added load).  I think the electric water pump theory is a good one.  Water
will flow on its own through the loop juat based upon the thermal
differential between the two temp extremes, so it will cool a little before
and after the pump is shut down anyway.  The question posed to the list is
how small should said cooler be?  Are Mesa coolers(non-tubular cooler)
useable with water, as opposed to oil?  Anyone with experience in this
dept., I think your two cents would be helpful to a few of us out here.
Thank you all for being here!
