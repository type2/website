Subject: Re: Brakes on 71 Westy

&gt; Ok I replaced the last brake hose and bled the brakes.  I can
&gt; 
&gt; find no obvious leaks but I continually have to pump the brakes
&gt; 
&gt; to build up a firm pedal which only lasts for a few seconds,
&gt; 
&gt; maybe 10 or so.  I checked to make sure all the bleed screws
&gt; 
&gt; were tight which they are and looked again for leaks, still
&gt; 
&gt; none.  Any idea why the pedal wont stay firm?  I have to admit
&gt; 
&gt; changing those lines helped at least a hundred percent, it
&gt; 
&gt; actually seems to stop well if I pump furiously. :)
&gt; 
Sounds like a master cylinder to me  (seals starting to leak usually). 
Also, if you recently rebuilt your brakes, there will likely be lots of 
air, so just keep bleeding the brakes - and do it in order of farthest 
line away from master cylinder to the closet line to the master cylinder, 
and then bleed the master cylinder itself.

ciao!
