Subject: POR-15 &amp; fiberglass

The folks at POR-15 claim that it is good for
fiberglass repair/resto. I understand that it needs
to be topcoated... is there anyone who has used it to
redo a poptop? If so would you use it again or go with
gelcoat?... oooorrr?( Yes I did read the poptop
article
on the type2 site.. just looking a little further).

TIA
