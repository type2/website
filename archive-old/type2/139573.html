Subject: distributor vacuum can fyi

Folks,

I thought I needed a new vacum can on my stock 78 bus distributor.

I went back thru the archives and found that someone had ordered
one from Autozone....so I tried it.

I had to wait 10days to get it, but it is a match.  The only difference 
was that it had 4 mounting holes rather than just two.

It cost a whole $15.36...could have gotten it faster, but didn't want to 
pay the &quot;special order&quot; shipping charges.

&quot;Wells&quot; part number RV1001...made by Bosch in Germany....the arm sticking 
out of it was stamped the same as the original except probably a manf 
date.

The important part was the 110? or 101 stamped close to the can which 
believe indicates the stroke.


Just a confirmation ofthe original post...whoever it was, Thanks!!!

Cheers, dave
