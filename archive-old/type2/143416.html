Hi Cliff,

I recently discovered that two of the road maps I store under the  
front seat of the westfakia are soaking wet.

Assuming we can safely rule out &quot;driver incontinence&quot;, I'd love to  
know where the water is getting in. Probably that %$# brazilian door  
seal. Grumble grrr grumble.


Happy trails,
