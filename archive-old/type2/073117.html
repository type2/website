Subject: Bob Hoover Sermons CD-ROM is SHIPPING!


Hi folks,

I just got word that the Sermons CDs made it to Bus Depot and they're ready
to ship, and for sale on the web site.

To order, go to Bus Depot &lt;http://www.busdepot_dot_com/ASP/Search.asp&gt; and then
simply choose &quot;Books &amp; Repair Manuals&quot; from the second pulldown menu. The
website can accept your personal check as payment if you're in the US or
most of Canada.

Overseas people: I'm told you'll be able to pay with a credit card before
long, or you may want to talk to Ron &lt;sales_at_busdepot_dot_com&gt; about a group
purchase to reduce transaction/shipping costs.

If you don't know, the Sermons of Bob Hoover was surely the most popular VW
resource on the net until it was pulled down earlier this year. Back when I
had the ability to log the Sermons web page, people were requesting about
38,000 sermons per week. It was an incredible resource--and still is.

For the CD, I went back through all available aircooled archives and read
everything Bob ever posted, harvesting anything that had technical merit.
About 30% of the material on the CD was never on the web site. The archive
now runs to 818 pages (yep!).

The CD is in hybrid Windows/Mac format and includes free Adobe Acrobat
software. Acrobat was chosen for the Sermons because it includes its own
search engine and it prints nice, too. Runs 19.95 + s&amp;h and for that we'll
throw in a free jewel case. =^ )
