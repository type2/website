John,

 
&gt; I just looked at the EGR filter that is lying next to my exhaust down
&gt; cellar.  I peeked though the numerous rust holes and saw *absolutely
&gt; nothing* - Yep, nothing , nada, zilch, nitchsnay,  was inside.  So
&gt; obviously, they contain only metal eating bacteria (ferrous-ravenous I
&gt; believe) - I suggest that you remove these things from your busses
&gt; immediately before the ferrous-ravenous escapes and starts eating the
&gt; body panels.  What? - your bus is already rusted - See I told you!

John, I'm glad to see that we have an expert with us tonight!  However,
after studying the microfilms, I believe that ferrous-ravenous was
replaced in 78 in California models, and in all 79 USA models with
ferrous-eatemupandspitemoutous, which had utility for mediating the
temporary rich condition seen following rapid deceleration and was also
cheaper and more reliable.  

On a serious note, I looked at my library of shop and other books last
night, and found that Haynes identifies the EGR filter in a figure as a
'carbon filter', but there was no other discussion of what was in them.  
Does that mean that it filters carbon, or that it uses carbon as the
filter medium?  I'm not sure.  All other books just call them EGR filters
and talk about replacing them every 15-30,000 miles, depending on the
model year.  So, in my mind at least, the mystery continues.

I plan to bring a hack saw to the junk yard, in order to do a dissection
-- sorry to whoever was appealing to others to refrain from the needless
disstruction of junkyard parts, but this is science!
