&gt; What is the low voltage problem?

just that.. charging voltage is too low

&gt; Are you experiencing start/running difficulty?

Nope... it's just that the charge voltage is too low and isn't 
triggering my battery isolator circuit.  If I'm correct, the running 
voltage should be somewhere around 13.5v to 14v

&gt; Are you reading voltage with accessories
&gt; (anything other than ignition) engaged?

Nope.  Just engine running.. no lights, no radio.

&gt; What is the voltage at the battery after overnight rest?

prolly around 12.3 or something like that.  The battery is good.. and 
new.  Second battery, so I doubt it's the battery.

&gt; Fully charged batteries will display your indicated charge rate.

they're definitely not showing 13.5-14, which is what I'm going for.

&gt; Try turning on headlights and other accessories.

The voltage drops to something like 12.5 or something..

&gt; Does it charge at 14v now?

Nope.. that's the problem.
