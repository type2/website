Subject: Re: [T2] Engine Seal

From: Frank E Biffath III
&gt; Just a quick question, Is it necessary to remove the engine in 2.0  (77-79) to install the engine
 seal?
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------

I am assuming you mean the foam seal that goes around the engine tin to the body?

No, you put in on with the engine in. No other way to do it. You have to remove the air filter assembly. Most
people put the ends at the rear but I find it easier to butt the ends at the front, by the throttle cable.
This makes it easier to clear the injectors on the right side.
