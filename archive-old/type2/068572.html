Subject: Re: 79 towing question

&gt; Can a '79 be towed by mountind a tow bar on the front bumper?
&gt;I plan to offer a guy $200 for a '79 tomorow and there is a chanch
&gt;that it may not run.  It's all there and it was running with low
&gt;compression on #3 when he parked it

Twice I have towed '74-79 buses with a U-Haul rented towbar. Costs about 
$20 to rent for a day, same price for one-way or local rental (at least in 
my area).  Have seen other (non-UHaul) towbars that did not look like they 
would work, though.
By the way, towing is probably a good idea.  If compression is very low in 
one cylinder, driving the bus any distance on 3 cylinders is a surefire way 
to overheat the motor and do even more damage.
