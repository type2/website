The Nikster... spreadin' the word...

The insurance appraiser came out this morning to do the official
estimate vs. valuation on Wendelin and he seems optimistic that I can
get her fixed without totalling her out.

The funny part was when he was doing the valuation inspection of the
camper options. He did that familiar wistful, &quot;I've always wanted one of
these....&quot; :-D So I ran down the different kinds of busses available,
told him about The List, our camping trips, and my adventures in Texas.
If (or when!) Cliff Miller shows up, be nice to him. :-) Besides, he's
got Wendelin's future in his hands. ;-)

After going to Joshua Tree with me last weekend, my friend Virginia says
that now she &quot;notices busses more and looks upon them with affection.&quot;
She's very excited about accompanying me to Busses By The Bridge. 

My friend Beth at work almost got in an accident with me in the car when
I shrieked with excitement after seeing a high-roof with that weird
notched top in The Valley (we didn't have time to leave a note). Last
night she asked me to find out if the owner of a beautiful sky-blue &amp;
white hard-top camper that she's &quot;in love with&quot; (the bus, sillies) she
saw heading south on I-5 is on The List.

Such is the allure of the VW bus.... I'm so glad I have mine, I get to
meet the coolest people. :-)
