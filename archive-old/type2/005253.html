Volks,

I just had my rear end raised last week on my 71.  Got sick of not being
able
to see anything other than pavement out the back window.  It had never been
done
before so the mechanic moved it 1 notch.  Now the bus looks perfectly level
and I can brace for rear impact with confidence. :)  He told me that if we
had done 2 notches it may have hit on the upper portion of the arm (total
cost out the door - $113.00).

I got to watch (I don't experiment with repairs on this bus) and learned
allot about the rear suspension.  The even better thing about this whole
experience was that a rear brake line broke during the process.  This lead
to an attempt to bleed the rear brakes.  This lead to the discovery that my
master cylinder is shot.  Prolly saved my life, oh, and the bus.

The master cylinder is ordered......
