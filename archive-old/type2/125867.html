Subject: [T2] Battery won't hold a charge

Hey Blake,
           There are a number of reasons a battery can go bad.  If your vehicle 
has an alternator with a bad diode, that will toast it.  If your generator 
regulator is 'way out of whack, that will toast it.  If you just purchased the 
bus, it is not inconceivable that the PO gave you a marginal battery, AMHIK.  
Obviously, your charger results indicate the battery does not want to hold a 
charge.  At this point, it would not be wise just to install a new battery 
without doing some testing.  It can be a PITA to pull the existing gen/alt and 
take it to your FLAPS for testing.  If your vehicle is at all driveable, you 
could get a &quot;comprehensive&quot; charging system test at some FLAPS.  Maybe others 
on this List would have further thoughts...... Glenn

I pulled the battery and went to sears and bought a battery charger it 
is a die hard 15/2 amp battery charger.
The battery is an UltraEnergy 85. It's made by Exide and sold through 
Strauss's (must be up east where I purchased the bus, I've never been 
to a Strauss's before) anyway...I hooked it up to the charger and it 
goes through its test and after about 5 minutes of charging the charger 
starts to blink, the manual for the charger tells me &quot;The battery could 
not be charged in a normal manner. This could be due to a battery with 
a partially shorted or open cell, sulfated battery plates or 
electrolyte out of ballance.&quot; Does this mean the batteries fried? If so 
what could have done it, the battery is less than a month old from the 
PO. I've already checked about the warranty and because its a used car 
the warranty isn't transferrable. I don't mind getting a new battery I 
just don't want to fry the next one if something else is wrong. Also 
what size / brands are recommended?
