Subject: Re: [T2] Engine Swap Info?

LoL!

I'm well aware of the work involved. Just looking for some
measurements and tips.

Honestly? The VW engine will take at least as much work to get it
running well (even with it being in decent condition to start with) as
swapping a much more forgiving engine.

The main reason is my wife. She wants the bus to be something she can
just hop into and drive. No warming up, no worrying about head temps,
etc.  (I know, I know.)

Total cost to my pocket will be around $800. Actually, probably less
if I can borrow an arc welder from somone. But I really want to buy
one anyway. Getting a built 1700 (or better yet a 2000) will be well
over $1000. And the VW engine still won't be as forgiving as the
Toyota engine.

I've done bizarre engine swaps in the past, and can do the
measurements and such myself, but if someone else has already done it,
why reinvent the wheel?

Most bizarre engine swap? Toyota v6 into a 67 Mustang. (Helped a
friend do it actually.) Amazingly, there was a kit out there for that
swap! I wonder how many Ford fans wanted to beat him up... LoL
