Subject: RE: Best place to buy sheet metal?

&gt; I'm getting ready to replace all the rusted metal on my 71 Westy.
&gt; Where's the best place to order it from? My main concerns are, first,
quality
&gt; and second, price. I'm going to be ordering quite a bit, so I will prefer
to order
&gt; everything from the same place. Thanks in advance for any help.


Most (but not all) 68-79 sheet metal sold in the U.S. comes from Veng of
Denmark, regardless of who you order it from. This is despite the fact that
some of it is actually still available in Genuine Volkswagen elsewhere in
the world (most of it originating from VW Brazil - but we're talking genuine
VW here, not aftermarket Brazilian).  Problem is, VW Brazil will not export
the products to North America, apparantly due to agreements between
VW/Brazil and VW/America that prevent them from competing with eachother
(even if VW/US does not offer the part anymore!).  So while others in the
world can get genuine stuff, we here in the U.S. can't.

I do, however, have some of the genuine stuff, despite the fact that it is
&quot;banned.&quot;  If you've ever heard of the term &quot;gray market,&quot; that is how the
genuine stuff finds its way into my hands.  Since I can't get it right from
VW, it gets exported overseas, then diverted back to the U.S.  It's a shame
that it has to take a world tour in order to reach U.S. bus owners, but it's
better than the alternative, which is not being available at all.
Presently, my 73-79 full-size corners, some of the rocker panels, full
jackpoint assemblies, and the left side 72-79 battery trays I have are
genuine VW, along with a few other pieces.  Also the majority of my 68-79
body rubber is Genuine VW, obtained the same way.  To my knowledge, nobody
else in the U.S. has these items.

Most of the rest is from Veng, and is generally of good quality.  But there
is a problem.  Veng went into bankruptcy liquidation about two months ago,
and stopped shipping.  Another company bought them out and will eventually
resume production, but supply on some parts will be limited for a while.  I
learned about the bankruptcy filing a bit before Veng's U.S. distributors
did, because of my European connections, and stockpiled inventory just
before they stopped shipping, so in most cases supply is okay for now -
hopefully enough to last until the new company resumes shipping.  The new
company is apparantly tightening distribution in Europe, which may lead to
higher prices.  However, this does not neccessarily mean that they will
employ the same strategy in the U.S.; time will tell.

While my website lists most of the sheet metal, it does not yet have a
diagram, which is unfortunately a nuisence.  However, my new print catalog
does have a full diagram with part numbers and prices. (In virtually every
case, the prices are lower than Motorworks et. al.)  Eventually, when time
allows (yeah, right :-) I will try to get the diagram onto the website as
well, but meanwhile it might pay to order a catalog.
