&gt;&gt;&gt; Only the FI busses have the paint can lid. That area is open on older busses

&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; My '74 (manual, so not FI) bus has the paint can lid.
&gt;
&gt;I guess that year is included because of the CA automatic model.

FYI, My '73 also has the paint can lid.  Maybe it started in '72 with the type IV?  My charcoal canister is fastened to the rear-center ceiling of the engine compartment.
