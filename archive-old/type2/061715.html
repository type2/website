&gt; Whoops, I mispoke! Just looked again at the Kennedy Engineering
&gt; site (http://www.kennedyeng_dot_com/sub_van.htm)  and they're saying 9.0:1
&gt; for the '86-'90 Vanagon and 9.5:1 for the '90-'94 Subaru run okay on
87
&gt; octane.
&gt; Thanks for posting that url, George -- I think my next Vanagon is
&gt; going to have to get Subaru-ized.

It does seem to be an ideal conversion, particularly if you can find a
late V-gon with a bad engine that someone will get rid of for a song. 
I have some experience with Subaru engines and they seem to be
well-designed (should be, they stole it from VW!).  I wouldn't use the
older wet-sleeve Subaru design as they tend to have coolant-oil leaks.
 Kennedy has been around for a long time servicing their niche market
and I've never heard a bad word about them.  The fact that they went
to the trouble to get CARB approval for the Subaru conversion shows
that they intend to sell a lot of these kits.

Be warned, though, that there is quite a lot of work to be done with
any conversion.  The devil is in the details and you'll be cussing at
the linkages, wiring, etc. before you're done.  Once done, you should
be prepared to maintain it yourself as few mechanics will want to
touch a car that is part VW, part Subaru,

I wonder if that SVX engine will fit into the V-gon?  I like the idea
of a 200 hp bus!
