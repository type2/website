&gt; &gt; 34 ICT's are pretty small carbs, aren't they?  What size engine do you have

&gt; 
&gt; --&gt; Sorry for not including more detail.  It's a 1970cc Type IV.  The
&gt; muffler is a rusted-out piece of crap Monza-style thing installed by the
&gt; PO...the exhaust system leaks like a seive, which is the next thing I plan
&gt; to fix, if I ever get this problem solved.

bite the bullet and get the parts needed to get the Fuel Injection
running.  find a junker with the parts you need.  it is far easier to get
the FI working than getting the engine to run worth beans on a carb.  

too many things are different.  besides that 1970 (2 liter) engine is
really sweet and powerful with a working Fuel Injection

as they say, that is only my opinion
