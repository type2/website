Subject: [T2] '71 water leak/heads up

I have had two '71 campers.  Something i noticed on both was that somehow
on those only water from rain or washing somehow made it's way into the
gas filler area.  After that the natural path into the gas tank was down
the breather hole.   Over time this can really cause havoc with the
engine as well as causing lots of rust in the tank.  My fix then was to
lay a rag in the gas filler area and that would soak up any sneaky water
and it would evaporate from there.  This seemed to work fine, i found the
rag wet quite often.  Far spilled gas though this may be a fire hazard. 
Well this is just a mid week heads up for those who care.

good driving,
scott
