Subject: Re: [T2] Back brake stuck onto wheel

This also happens to me on occasion.  Usually when its humid out or
rather hot also.  Like Andy states, the only way I have been able to get
them to break loose is by putting it in gear (1st seems to work better
than reverse) and throttle up until it pops.  I know this can't be good
and hopefully this will go away when I rebuild my brakes.  I also tried
tapping on the with the mallot but that didn't work out.

&gt; &gt; My rear right side brake (I presume the hand brake) seems to be stuck to
&gt; &gt; the wheel . I release the handbrake and the van won't budge. It was only
&gt; &gt; a few days since I was last driving it but had been raining a lot if
&gt; &gt; that has anything to do with it.

&gt; Its been raining in miami like 21 days straight and Ive been noticing my
&gt; rear brakes have grabbed on a couple times recently too.
&gt; Hopefully with a little back and forth throttle persuasion you can get
&gt; them to let loose.
&gt; good luck
