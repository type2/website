Subject: [T2] Pics are up for my 71 double cab

Hey guys, it's me again!
I have posted some undercarriage pics of my 71 truck on my photopoint page so 
those of you with ;ate model busses (prefer 71) can tell me what is or isn't 
wrong/missing.  I'd appreciate any comments via e-mail.
Thanks.  
Dave
