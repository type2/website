Subject: Who was that masked man?

Hiya All,

I got involved in recent thread concerning the turn signal switch for a 1970 
Bus (Craig's IIRC).  Anyway, somewhere along the line I (think I) got an 
e-mail which asked about soldering/repairing a switch.  Unfortunately that e-mail 
got inadvertently zapped.  So......did somebody out there in Type2land send me 
an e-mail asking about soldering a turn signal switch?
