I have a 71 Westy, and after I drive it the engine is red hot.  The dipstick will peel the skin off of you hands.  All the engine tin seems to be in place, and the seal is there.  I checked the alternator belt, and it was tight.  I don't have an oil temp. gauge, so I am not sure of the temp, but it is pretty hot.  Any suggestions of what else to try?  

I am also have trouble with the pop top.  This is my first bus with a pop top, so I am not too familiar with these.  The problem is that when the top is lowered, the front is uneven.  It doesn't seem to be latching down all the way.  Any tricks to get the front to seat properly?

Thanks,

Bryan
