The other circumstance that makes it difficult to have confidence in the
guidance the owners manual gives (about warmitup vs. driverightoff) is
that the manufacturer has to live with, for emissions testing purposes,
its owners manual recommendations.  If it says let the car sit in the
driveway for 5 minutes, those emissions will be added in while the
denominator, the miles travelled in the EPA standard loop, doesn't change.
