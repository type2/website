Subject: troubleshooting engine leak

Hi,

 

Excuse me for not being more direct about my fault.

 

I live in Canada on PEI and the Lavie brothers are a main source for
repairs.

 

However, this list exceeds any advice I can get from other sources, you
people are the greatest!

 

My Bus is a 1978 CDN Campmobile.

 

160000 on the original type 4 engine.

 

I had to replace the crank seal behind the fan. I am able to see it and it
looks good.

 

If someone is mentioning something about an oil sensor seal, I am wondering
if you could refer me to the green Bentley manual, page and section.

 

I cleaned everything up and ran the engine, before air flaps could open and
about 5 minutes in, the oil started to flow from above the oil filter and
fast! Some fast.

 

So, that confirms the leak.

 

Could it be on the oil cooler? It looks tricky to get out.

 

If it is the seal for the oil temp indicator, that makes a lot of sense to
me.

 

Since my bus has recently been painted, I am discovering stuff jammed up,
like the temp flaps which created an over heat condition earlier this
summer.

 

Thanks guys.

 

Alan
