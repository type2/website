Hi Tooers
I recently bought a super clean 83 Westy air cooled with a burned # 4
piston. The engine had low miles since a pro rebuild. Apparently the #4
injector got clogged, causing weak mixture and burned the piston on a
long high speed trip. I am replacing the # 4 piston and cylinder that is
well within specs ad also replacing te head with a good one that does
not have pieces of top ring stuck in it.
I removed the rod and the bearing is fine and I have new con rod nuts
but there does not appear to be any way to saftey the nuts. Are they
just torqued and wont loosen or is their a trick? My Bently and Haynes
book are silent on this. I am also replacing the oil cooler even tho the
strainer and filter were clean. Any one out there have this kind of
repair work out well? All advise appreciated.
Vanagonly, Jack Handy
