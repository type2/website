Subject: Rear/side window installation

Hello. Two years ago, I bought window gaskets from busdepot for, I think $20 apiece. I don't know if these were the German or the Brazilian or if there is a difference. Putting the gaskets to use for the first time, we tried installing the windows tonight. Using the string method, we started with the passenger side rear window. We wrestled with it for quite some time. It was lubricated, very lubricated with silicone spray. Once the window and gasket were in at the bottom, they didn't want to go in at the top... I don't know if these are bad gaskets or what, but they were being a little more stubborn than what could be considered &quot;normal.&quot; We could not get more than one side of the gasket flush with the lip at a time. When we did get the top in, the bottom would slip out. There are brackets along the bottom sill for the track cover which did not permit us to put the top in first. What's the secret? Should I soak these gaskets or something? This is incredibly frustrating. Thank you for
 any advice.                                  -Paul Deatherage
