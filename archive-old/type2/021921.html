What I have done is thread a rag through the hole and yanked the clip around
that way.  Always works and is less damaging than a metal tool
(esthetically).

I haven't seen it, but you might try using a brake-adjustment tool.  It
might just have the correct angle to pry the wire bail into position.

Hope this helps.
