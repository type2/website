Subject: Bizarre dwell?

The Guac has been feeling like it's misfiring at all RPMs and throttle
positions, even idle. It started as soon as I got to CA, but I haven't had a
chance to take a look. There's no loss of power, but especially when not at
full throttle it's just rough.

So the first thing I did was pull the plugs. All had a grey ash color. But
no signs of not firing.

Then I pulled the plug wires one at a time. The change in rpm (that's
bouncing between 500 and 650 when all are plugged in) changed about the same
for all four cylinders.

Checked the dwell. 90*. I thought, &quot;Ah ha!&quot; But it was not to be. I pulled
the distributor and reset the points. I set at 18* just do see what dwell
I'd get and adjust from there. Rubbing block was fine. But when I put it
back together and fired it up, I still got 90*. I revved the engine to see
if the dwell would change (testing the meter) and it made the normal slight
change.

It got dark so I haven't changed the points yet (will tomorrow). But does
that sound right? It just seems odd...
