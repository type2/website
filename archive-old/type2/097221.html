Subject: Fw: VW Bus Needed For Film in Orlando, Florida

----- Original Message -----
From: EdwardJordon_at_aol_dot_com
We are filming an independent film in the Orlando, Florida area. The title is
&quot;Bollywood and Vine.&quot; We seek a vintage VW bus to use in the film...hopefully
one that's colorful...and runs! LOL! (It can be beat up, though)

We need it A.S.A.P.

We are a low budget production, so we can only offer up to $150.00 for three
days use of the bus.

If you can pass this note along to your membership, it would be greatly
appreciated.

If anyone wants a reference, I will provide the mail and email address of the
owner of a 1964 Triumph that we have already used in the film. We returned it
in tip top shape.

Also...To check my integrity and legitimacy as a filmmaker, I invite you and
your membership to visit the website for one of my feature-length
documentaries at

http://members.aol_dot_com/_ht_a/telepictur/BlinkingEyes.html

I am proud to say that my work has been exhibited (by special invitation) at
the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C., the Academy of Motion Picture
Arts and Sciences, and the American Film Institute, among other important
venues.

Thanks so much!

Sincerely,
Edward Jordon
