Subject: Engine Seal Installation Procedure?

hey now,

i've got an engine seal for the '77 on order from RMMW. i've never installed
one but the '77 definitely needs one since the old one is crumbling apart.
is this something that can be done withouth dropping the engine?

if anyone can give me an idea on how this seal goes in and any hints i'd sure
appreciate it.

thanks,

jonathan
