Subject: VW-REPLACING HORN WIRE

My '71 Type II's steering wheel shaft horn wire is shot.  It seems to have
a break somewhere and I'd like to replace it.  However, I have heard
whispers of horrorific tales related to messing around with this sort of
thing, stories that make do-it-yourself ball joint repair using only a
pair of vice grips and some duct tape seem like a walk in the park

The old wire is still there though when I have gently tried to pull on
either end, it doesn't move (I was hoping to be able to tie a new wire on
one end and thread it through by pulling on the other). I'd just snap the
sucker out and start anew but I can't for the life of me figure out how a
wire that goes down a hollow, turning shaft could ever exit at the bottom
without getting messed up in the steering box.

Anyway, any advice would be appreciated.  At the moment I've got an
alternative wire to the horn that is triggered by pulling the knob on the
disabled rear-window defroster switch but that's so lame I hesitate to
repeat it here.

Thanks,


Nick
