A lot of talked surfaced over the last few days on this subject, and some
statements have been made that aren't strictly true.  I'm going to strive to
set all things straight on this subject but first I want to note for
everyone's sake.  WE HAVE DEALT WITH THIS BEFORE.  Many, many, many, many,
many times.  Ken maintains a www site dedicated to this list for a purpose,
use it.

Now first off I'm going to make the big sacrilegious statement that will
send a lot of people off howling in pain and disbelief, to them I say use
your brains for a second and get over it.

Despite what the ignorant ramblings of a stoner bus driver who wanted you to
keep something alive imply (hey I've read the original printing), and
everything your mama ever taught you about VW's, it IS NOT necessary to
adjust HYDRAULIC lifters stone cold, in fact as I will later present there
are times and means where you purposely strive for this not to be the case.
To anyone put off by this assertion, quit reading now, I don't care.  To
those who want to learn from someone who actually knows, who's owned plenty
of buses, vanagons, whatever, with hydraulics and adjusted them every which
way countless times, read on.

I'm going to back this statement up right at the top with cold hard fact.
When you adjust a hydraulic lifter, you are adjusting it to contact plus
somewhere between 1 and 2 turns of the rocker arm adjuster screw.  I'll give
everyone a hint, that screw is a special fine pitch 10mm but still is good
for 1mm per turn, that is .040&quot; per turn, so taking a happy average of the
information available you will be adjusting to .060&quot; past contact.  Now
think for a second about why on a solid lifter car you adjust the lifters
stone cold, the reason is so that you aren't adjusting them when valves are
warm and &quot;stretched.&quot;  I'm also a mecahnical engineer, and I'm not going to
bore you with numbers but think for a second about what YOU know, we adjust
those solids to .006&quot; gap, that means come hell or high whatever we take it
that an exhaust valve will NEVER stretch more than .006&quot; in use, else we
would be holding it open all the time even when on the backside of the cam
lobe and that is way conservative, they aren't going to probably stretch
more than a few thousandths of an inch.  So we know a valve isn't going to
stretch more than .006&quot;, we know that VW over the years has proffered an
adjustment range from .040&quot; to .080&quot; past contact on the hydraulic lifters,
frankly that valve can be as hot as it can get and you still have a 3 to 4
time slush factor either way of a &quot;perfect&quot; adjustment.  So get over it,
they don't have to be cold, now obviously you don't want to burn yourself or
anything, but get over the fact the engine can have just run.

Now why are we doing this.  Well you just bought that beautiful lime green
and rust '78 Westy and when you start her in the mornings you get something
between a tapping to pounding sound from the ole engine changing with engine
speed.  You remember what the ole bug, 60's or early 70's bus, whatever
sounded like with loose valves and this sounds the same but even louder,
even up to a hard pounding beat.  You think you got em hydrauleeec lifters.
First, how do you tell?  Couple ways.  Pull a valve cover, any valve cover.
Take the mini Mag Lite and look up a pushrod tube around the rocker arm.  If
that little pushrod is only about the size of a big round (3/8&quot;) pencil all
the way end to end and looks steel (probably brown and oily), chances are
there are still hydraulic lifters in there.  If instead right behind the tip
behind the rocker arm the pushrod steps out to a big ugly aluminum rod
(probably closer to 1/2&quot; diameter and probably more silver in color) chances
are you have solid lifters in the block, if they are all currently adjusted
to somewhere in the .004-.008&quot; range you can guess pretty much for sure.  By
the book only GD, GE, or CV blocks came from VW with hydraulics but only '78
and '79 GD blocks, all Vanagon CV blocks came.  But hydraulics could have
found their way into any T4 block over the years along hopefully with a
hydraulic cam and the steel pushrods.  Now obviously if you see steel
pushrods and if when you rotate each cylinder to TDC and try to get a feeler
between the valve tip and rocker screw and there isn't a gap, you got em,
hydraulics, a good thing actually, but why that infernal pounding.  Well the
hydraulic lifter lets the valve ride on a cushion of oil, always maintaining
perfect preload and contact on the cam but not so much (oil pressure
balances the spring pressure) that it holds the valve open.  Now as these
accumulate time (say your '78 shows an actual 120k or so on the original
engine, though they can get noisy much earlier if not driven, not
maintained, etc) the lifter parts lose their tolerances and overnight, or
after setting, the oil inside them leaks out, air leaks in and when you
start he up, the air has to find it's way out.  Imagine the lifter as a
syringe of water, but with the needle end closed and flat against the cam,
the plunger against the pushrod.  Now that water inside is instead being
pressurized constantly to 40 psi or so (oil pressure) from a little hole in
the side of the syringe.  If a big bubble of air leaks in so it is only half
water and half air inside, and if everything is closed off (by the external
oil pressure when you start the car) the air is trapped and when you push on
the plunger the air compresses and the plunger can collapse easily some
distance before a balance is achieved.  Oil can't be squeezed, air can be,
air is no good.  You can check for this if you have the noise.  Go along
with a big screwdriver and try to push on the bottom end of the rocker
shafts, right in line with the pushrod (when the cylinder is near or at TDC
and the valve train is not loaded, though many of the valves will be
unloaded at once so give em all a quick push.)  The rocker shaft is knurled
right where you press so the screwdriver won't slip.  When you press (and I
mean a good hard press) there should be NO MOVEMENT, at all.  Chances are
some of them will be &quot;soft&quot; when you press them, maybe will move in say less
than 1/16&quot; of an inch feeling spongy.  Those have air, but are probably OK.
Then there will be a couple real offenders, you will be able to shove them a
good bit, these have big time air in them, little oil, you are basically
just compressing the big spring in the lifter.  So we have hydraulic
lifters, they have air in them, what do we do.

First off, nothing.  Does this happen every day?  Does the rapping stop
after 10-15 minutes driving?  If you drive the bus everyday does it stop
even faster?  My first opinion, unless you know the engine has been fooled
with (by an idiot), amd the bus hasn't been driven in a few weeks, change
the oil to something light (10W30), put on a new filter, and sit there in
the drive and rev it up and down for 15-20 minutes, staying in the 2000-2500
rpm range.  Get it good and warm but don't rev it too high.  If the bus has
sat for a few months, or even a few weeks, and begins to quiet out, then
subsequently quiets out each morning after even up to as much as 10 minutes,
and isn't banging REALLY loud don't sweat it.  I parked my old '78 on a
sideways slope for 8 months then fired her up, it always had 2 dying
lifters, they pounded for 1/2 an hour, and I mean pounded.  Make sure all
the rocker shaft nuts are torqued correctly and go on be happy.  And NEVER,
EVER, use Quaker State oil.  I don't care what Arnold uses in a commercial
with his dad's tractor up in Latrobe, don't run QS in VW hydraulic lifters.
Generally though I do run the oil VW recs, for me in my climate that means
10W30 winters (but only if it stays cold else maybe some 15W40) and 20W50 in
the summer.  VW is very conservative about oil, they rec thicker stuff than
anyone out there.  Use good oil, change it every 3-5000 with a good filter,
and running the proper weight oils aren't going to cause you any noise or
trouble.  I use Castrol GTX or Shell Rotella exclusively.  In fact I can
often run the Rotella 15W40 diesel weight oil year round say in a camper
that doesn't get everyday use.

So it still pounds, and maybe I thought I'd adjust the valves before I knew
better, or maybe I don't trust the guy I just bought the Bus from (a lot of
bad people prey on want to be hippy types now days), or maybe I'm just
bored, what do we do next.  Well there are 3 solutions, god's way, the
liquid way, the compromise method (proffered by Mark Stevens and others.)

First, the way god, Muir, your mama, intended it.  On the 8th day of
creation, god said let the German people try to redeem themselves for WW2 by
creating and exporting the Volkswagen car, and let all who maintain them
know thou shalt adjust the valves ice cold.  Later as they lost faith
apparently he let the Japanese run clean over the Germans and everyone else,
anyway you believe despite what I said and you want a solution.  It is here,
but it is the hardest, most labor intensive way and won't likely buy you
anything.  You open up a copy of the Bentley bible and look at what god
wrote on the hastily added subject of hydraulic lifters.  You seek out the
BENCH BLEEDING.  God says in chapter 5, verse 17.2 on the subject to first
remove the lifters.  To do this you must, pull the valve covers, pull the
springs retaining the pushrod tubes, pull the rocker arms, pull the
pushrods, pull the pushrod tubes (beginning to understand why this is the
sadomasochist way?), then pull the lifters.  Some notes, this can be a good
thing to do if you say want to replace pushrod tube seals anyway, look in
those archives for a previous tirade about the subject, what works, and what
doesn't (short form no RTV, O-rings work on clean lubricated surfaces by
compression, think that a tube of blue, orange, red, or black wonder stuff
is going to save you and you'll be back again in a few months.) So we get
all that out of the way then we IMMACULATELY clean the areas surrounding
each lifter bore, in fact first thing you should have done was day before,
pulled the under pushrod tins if present, soaked bottom of the engine block
with degreaser, scrubbed up on the block around the tubes with a toothbrush,
then hosed it off with hot water, then let it set to cool and dry overnight.
Even if you did that you now clean out each bore carefully with as much say
kerosene and paper towels as it takes, the bigger part of the bore where the
pushrod tube O-ring has been riding and you make sure nothing is up in the
machined lifter bore itself.  Pushing a scrap of towel back in on top of the
lifter and using a toothbrush out on the bore where the o-ring sits is good,
towel keeps stuff from going back in the bore.  While you are at it, do the
same to the bores over on the heads, that along with the viton O-rings
reinstalled with silicone grease or at least oil and those tubes won't leak
no more assuming they are not dented where the o-ring sits and assuming
something like blowby isn't pressurizing the case to the point nothing will
stop the leaking.  So anyway the bore is spotless, we now pull the lifters.
Use a good 2lb magnetic parts picker upper pointer thing, or catch the lip
of the lifter with a pointy right angle pick (but watch that cause you don't
want to slip off and scratch the bore.)  But if everything is clean, the
magnet should get em out, might have to work em back and forth a bit.  You
pull all of them and keep them in order (egg carton with numbered holes,
#1I, #1E, #2I, #2E, you get the picture) or you do them one at a time, or
you just do the ones that felt soft anyway, but you keep them in order.  So
they are out, now is a good time to do something else, look at that cam, the
T4 cam wears badly, say power and compression are off, and maybe even the
heads are newish on an old bottom end.  Look down those holes at the toe
(top area) of one of the lobes on the cam, At least one is going to be
facing you down a hole.  Is it nice and smooth and even or is there a 1/16&quot;
dip in the center.  If you got a healthy dip, your compression has been low,
and power is down, your bottom end's days are numbered.  If there are over
100k on the thing anyway and you didn't buy it from a little old lady with
oil change receipts every 3000 miles, keep it in the back of your mind that
power will continue to wane and you have a $1500 bill coming sometime in the
next 25k miles or so.  The T4 bottom end is rock solid as far as crank and
rods but the cams wear.  But back to the task at hand.  You see the bible
and see what it says to do.  First off ONE AT A TIME, and return them to
their numbered bins.  Get a little can of kerosene, a pair of nice needle
nose pliers will do or maybe 2 tiny flat screwdrivers, a pick or a paper
clip, and ideally an old bug pushrod, or a rod of something about 5/16&quot;
diameter, even a bolt but file off the end a bit semicircular then smooth on
sandpaper then clean it off.  So take a lifter, first thing check it.  They
say push the socket with your thumb, I say use the pushrod, even one of
yours for now.  Lean on it with all your might.  If it doesn't move, or
barely moves, return it to the tray, if the socket sinks noticeably and
easily, while holding it down (not really necessary) remove the circlip with
your needle nose or the 2 screwdrivers.  A good word here, unless you got 10
or 20 used lifters sitting in a box like me, do this in a clean area on
clean newspaper (kitchen table is good) cause if that circlip flies off
yonder in the basement, garage, front lawn, wherever, and you want to drive
this bus tomorrow, you better have a metal detector (yeah ask me how I
know.)  Take out the socket, plunger (with check ball and it's spring and
retainer), big spring, etc.  The valve retainer will snap off the plunger
with finger pressure revealing the ball and little spring.  Let it all soak
in the can of kerosene for a few minutes, then scrub all the parts with a
toothbrush or Q-tips, then lay everything out to dry on a paper towel.
Everything should be clean and shiny, blow out the body with air if
available, else make sure all the kerosene is gone with a paper towel or
Q-tips and blow the lint off with your mouth.  If anything looks ungodly
worn scratched or scored, you should replace it.  But point of fact, most of
even the real soft ones look just brand new inside.  The wear and tolerances
we are dealing with here are minute.  Now we put it together.  First thing,
throw the Bus Bentley away at this point.  Unless newer copies have an
update they want you to have a press and do some stupid stuff involving
keeping the body immersed in a pan of oil while pressing and who knows what.
Funny thing is the instructions in the Vanagon book still show the stupid
stuff for the air cooled van then the smart way for wasserboxers, all with
the same lifters, if you can get a copy the page in the Vanagon book is
15.24.  We will take the smart way.  You need a vice.  Or just maybe a nice
big C clamp, never tried it though.  A little vice will do, just the length
of the lifter plus an inch or so.  You also need about an inch of that bug
pushrod, or the inch long 5/16&quot; bolt with the tip filed semicircle and
sanded nice and smooth.  What you do is this.  Take a little SAE40 oil and
lube all the parts, then put the little spring in the check valve retainer,
sit the little ball on the spring, and clip the assembly to the bottom of
the plunger, looking to make sure the ball stays centered, on the spring,
and all.  Then drop the big spring in the body of the lifter and take the
SAE40 oil and fill the body of the lifter overflowing.  Immediately drop in
the assembled plunger/check valve assembly with oil swashing out the hole in
the side of the body and over the top, but as you put it in, put a pick or
the tip of the paper clip in the hole pushing the little ball down, so as
the plunger slides in, oil and any air under the plunger come out the valve
and the plunger sinks nicely into the oil filled body.  Push it down with
you fingers as far as you can.  Now top off the body if it has flowed out
and drop in the pushrod socket.  You won't be able to get this in nearly all
the way that is what the vice is for.  Immediately take the lifter to the
vice, but put a pad between the lifter face and the vice (aluminum soft jaws
are great if you have them) and hold the lifter there with the little hole
in the side of the body FACING UP while you hold it all together.  Use your
bolt or 1&quot; section of pushrod or whatever in the socket and close the vice
compressing the socket in as shown in the Vanagon Bentley figure 15-493,
just far enough to expose the groove for the circlip, oil will ooze out the
body side hole.  Install the circlip.  Take it all out, store with the face
down, and test it again with thumb pressure or the pushrod.  It should be
rock solid.  Repeat this as many times as needed on the lifters that need
it.  Then reinstall the lifters, the pushrod tubes, the pushrods, the
rockers, the retainer springs, everything in order.  Go around and back all
the adjuster screws out maybe 3 or so turns.  Ok time to adjust valves, I'm
assuming you know the basics, if not on this one instance, read Muir or
actually the section in the Bus Bentley is OK, Haynes is probably good as
well.  Go to each cylinder one at a time and set it to TDC for adjustment.
If you've backed the screw out 3 turns or so, both rockers on that screw
should rattle freely (Bentley says back it all the way till it is flush with
the rocker, that is fine as well, but make sure the pushrod does not slip
out of the socket on either end at the lifter or in the rocker, with them
just loose this won't happen, double check looking down the pushrod with the
mini Mag Lite, the pushrod should spin if it is loose in between the two
sockets, if it does fall out on the inside end and rest against the lifter
somewhere else, you are going to notice cause the pushrod will be too far
out making the adjuster screw contact way before all the others do probably
before it is even hardly out past the rocker.)  Also check when you push
with the screwdriver on the pushrod end of the rocker it should now be dead
solid.  But you might have a time limit here.  Even with 40 weight oil, and
not having run or warmed up, your newly bled lifter could leak in air
overnight just sitting there on its side, so install them immediately before
adjusting and tend to install the lifters with the little holes initially
up.  So anyway the rockers are loose on that cylinder at TDC.  I always
check the torque on the rocker shaft nuts right here with tension off, a
good time.  You then watch and run each screw in till it just touches the
valve.  A good way is be rocking it with one hand (tap, tap, tap) while you
turn, when it just touches no tap.  Then you turn it 1, 1.5, or 2 complete
more turns.  VW initially said 2, some say 1, I compromise, 1.5 turns.  Do
both on that cylinder, tighten the adjusting lock nuts (no real need to be
fussy about holding the screw while tightening, just make sure the screw
doesn't turn a turn or anything while you cinch the nut, not like it is
going to.)  Then follow Muir, follow your brain, whatever, move on to the
next cylinder, set it at TDC, repeat.  Ad infinitum.  You have just
correctly adjusted your lifters by the book, now for the bad news.  They are
going to stay that way with that thick oil in them until you run it the
first time, and it sets a day, and then you are back to tap, tap, tap, tap.
If a lifter is that badly worn, you did nothing more than an exercise in
learning.  Perhaps you should replace the real soft ones, or if they quiet
down after 5-10 minutes, live happily knowing they are set correctly.  And
maybe the pushrod tubes don't leak anymore, and maybe you know the cam is
worn and should be passing the Bus along or thinking about a rebuild.

Secondly the liquid solution.  Even after the oil change the valves still
tap mercilessly, and don't stop after 20 minutes of revving in the 2000-2500
rpm range, you pull the covers and see they are soft.  You don't want to do
more.  What do you do.  First know particularly if the engine is in the 100k
range and there is lots of burnt oil in the rocker boxes it may not be long
for this life.  But maybe it has just sat a long time and the lifters sat
with gunky oil.  They need a roto-rooter.  Couple of way.  First, wonder
stuff in a can, by STP, CD-2?, Warner, whoever aromatic solvents claiming to
solve all your lifter problems.  It may all right, or it may knock so much
crap loose you will regret it the rest of your engines short life.  If this
is a new engine with lower miles I might just be inclined to toss a can of
wonder stuff in.  But I'd do it a couple of days before an oil change and if
it doesn't help, change the oil.  Next option roto-root with thin oil.
SAE10 if you can find it, Dexron ATF otherwise.  Somewhere between 50/50
10W30 to ATF or just straight ATF if you are feeling manly.  Be forewarned
here we are talking potentially engine fatal things if too much stuff breaks
loose or if things get too hot, a new oil filter should catch most stuff,
but...  I've gone the straight ATF route, for you maybe the 50/50.  IF AT
ANY TIME YOU SEE THE OIL LIGHT COME ON, STOP IMMEDIATELY, COOL DOWN, BACK TO
OIL.  Even with worn stuff on a 150k mile engine never should a 10 minute
run keeping the revs up cause an oil pressure problem, if it does, you got
other mechanical issues, worn pump, extreme bottom end wear, overheating,
something.  So start the van up and again same as before, 2000-2500 rpm,
this time for about 10 minutes, keep the rpm's moving around a bit, let the
neighbors wonder.  Then let it cool for 30 minutes, then again.  Repeat
maybe 4-5 times with good long cool downs, stop if the lifters stop tapping.
If by trial number 5 nothing is changed, stop change back to oil, consider
replacing suspect lifters as in step 1.  If the noise at idle did go away,
stop, new quality oil and filter, keep it changed, like every 3000, and
start the bus every day and let her run 15 minutes or so.  This can be a
great trick to clean things out, it can also be fatal if done badly or if
you are unlucky, and if your bottom end is loose already, nothing fixes
extreme wear and bad maintenance.  I've done this to clean out a few vans,
do it wisely and at your own risk, I also killed a GTI engine this way
sucking too much crap up the filter screen.  I have in fact had professional
mechanics rec the straight ATF route, again at YOUR own risk, you know what
the Bus means to you more than I do, I've got 3 cars I can hop in and drive,
most days at least 8-)

Third option, my lifters are noisy for 5-10 minutes and quiet out to no more
than a minor tapping at idle or when I let up on the throttle suddenly after
acceleration.  I'd like to do something scientific minded but don't want to
pull the lifters, I yearn for the old adjustment days, what can I do.  This
is the best thing to do when you just get a new to you bus.  First check for
the soft lifters as before.  Then do the following.  Adjust all the valves
to .006 just like a solid lifter car.  But this is a bit tricky, you got to
be sure when you look to adjust one that is soft that the feeler gage isn't
just compressing the lifter, so go to TDC, back the screws out till they
don't touch, and just gently rest a finger against the pushrod end of the
rocker holding it against the lifter, but not compressing the soft lifter,
then adjust the other end to the .006 gap.  Repeat for all valves at the
appropriate TDC for each cylinder.  Start the engine and let her run a
minute or 2 at 2000-2500 rpm, it will be loud, loud as mechanicals and
louder.  Maybe it will quiet out a bit.  Stop and run back and pop the valve
covers turn to a cylinder and see if the previously soft lifters are now
hard, if so immediately close the gap (which may already be gone if a soft
one pumped up, in that case open the gap then close to just contact) and
adjust to 1.5 turns past contact as detailed first off.  Yes the valves are
warm, we covered that already, basically don't burn yourself.  Thing is if
you check them all before you started adjusting and they were all 8 solid,
come time you adjust, turn the engine, then adjust, you may get to the last
4 and they might already be soft again, my old '78 was this way, the bad
ones would only hold pressure for maybe a minute or 2, had to work fast on
them.  But no real problem, do the one side first, then put the valve covers
on (unless you are more of a real man than I) start it for another 2
minutes, go do the other side.  This is a good practical way to get them
pumped up and assure they are in good adjustment.  If you adjust to 1.5 past
contact ON A SOLIDLY PUMPED LIFTER you endanger nothing in the valve train
and the lifters have plenty of slop.  Plus they seem to pump up better
running loose.  If they refused to pump solid you need to adjust to about a
turn or so past contact to roughly where it was before you started, but
contact being ascertained as before gently holding the rocker on the
pushrod, and probably need to consider replacing that lifter, bench bleeding
and then eventually replacing the lifter, or just hoping it goes away.  Now
some play is acceptable but if you can push the rocker down an 1/8&quot; you got
problems.  You do it all the way round and again retire with the sense all
is right.  Next morning nothing will have changed, so same stuff, keep the
oil clean, and don't worry if they tap for even as much as 15 minutes or
more if the bus sits for a month or so.  Basically don't worry it so much
unless things are really banging around back there.  You may want to
consider the roto-rooter, it can work miracles and stop the noise, or it
could be a $1500 solution, again you feel the importance, you make the
choice.  Strictly within 15 minutes most days you should have nothing more
than extremely minor tapping and valve noise from a hydraulic lifter VW van,
perhaps you can have noise from one or two lifters that sounds like a
properly adjusted mechanical lifter bus, no more.  And the length of time it
taps depends on the oil, angle it was parked on, how long it has been since
run, etc.  But a faint persistent tapping from one now and then that won't
purge is nothing to get in a tizzy about, chances are it will come and go.

A couple other things, someone mentioned that valves seats had been cut to
the point where the rocker shafts rested on the retainer and compressed the
valve.  That isn't right, personally I don't think a T4 seat installed at
the correct height could be cut so far (correctly without cutting out of the
seat) that the valve is that far back into the rocker box.  I'm not sure on
this only guessing.  The solution to shim the rockers is about all you could
do, but this is not right, spring tension would be way low in this case.  An
interesting thing I recently noticed and did not know, the 1.7 style rockers
with 8mm adjusting screws perhaps have a different ratio and are not
interchangeable with 2.0 rockers, or maybe the rocker shafts are set at a
slightly different height?  Case in point a set of 2.0 rockers we had did
just as mentioned when installed on 1.7 heads.  Perhaps the real problem
here is 1.7 heads rebuilt for the 2.0 engine, or perhaps the difference was
my imagination, some other things were going on at the time I tried the 2.0
rockers and I may have been imagining the whole thing.  Or perhaps the early
solid lifter 1.7 stuff and the 2.0 hydraulic valve train stuff isn't
strictly interchangeable.  Regardless something is incorrect in that
situation.  There should always be adequate clearance between the rocker arm
and the retainer, this is very important, the adjuster screws should
essentially be sticking out past the face of the rockers for the entire
distance where they are turned down and probably a couple of threads.  If
anything, with machined valve tips they should be sticking out more.
Generally for all the prior procedures it is a good bet that ALL 8 ADJUSTER
SCREWS best be turned in about the same amount if everything is correct.  If
one is drastically different from the others, something is wrong, the
pushrod is not seated correctly, the rocker shaft isn't tightened, you
adjusted at the wrong time, or another thing on the same issue.  The tips of
all the valves should be level with the rockers removed and a straightedge
across the tips.  Within reason that is depending on if the tips are
machined and small variance in the valve seats but if one of the valves is
sticking out over 1/16&quot; when all the rocker shafts are off, you have the
beginning of seat recession, if that cylinder is also say at 90 psi or so,
say hello to a new set of heads or an engine rebuild soon.  And they will
run with a seat pounded 1/8&quot; into the head, not well but they will run.  All
the adjustment in the world isn't going to help you.  A final note, if you
do have a couple real bad lifters and they disturb you, even the 10 minute
tapping, replace them.  About $10 from Bus Depot or whoever, more from RMMW.
This may or may not be a great idea though as the lifter isn't guaranteed to
be a great match for the hardness of the cam.  Also some of the replacement
lifters have a smaller hole in the side of the body than the OEM had and can
be inclined to be more prone to not purge air.  If you do install a new one,
make sure it was properly bench bled solid before installation.  Like I've
sort of implied, all these problems tend to show on old, high mileage vans,
by the time you have 125k on a T4 engine if it hasn't been well maintained,
chances are that the cam is beginning to wear with the hydraulic lifters,
the heads are probably soon for the next life, and on and on and on.
Replacing some things may buy you time but you must carefully consider
everything you do, for instance $500 in heads on an engine whose cam is
failing doesn't make a lot of sense, maybe you should have save for the
engine.  A lot of vans get sold this way, kid pays too much ($2500 for a
$1000 bus), then 6 months later has heads put on to the tune of $600 or more
installed, often badly with  non VW mechanic leaving big gaps in the tin,
then come another 6 months or a year the engine is kaput and you sell the
whole thing to me for $500 cursing your bus experience all the way.  Be
smart, trust your own judgement not what people tell you, pick up a copy of
Wilson's book and read it even if you never ever intend to rebuild your own
engine so you can speak intelligently to a shop, read Bob Hoover's words of
wisdom, and at least run the checks Muir describes before ever buying a bus
in the first place.  As our listmaster used to often say, if you can't
adjust your valves you shouldn't even own the bus in the first place.

A final note Bob Donaldson at www.bostonengine_dot_com has some sensible words
on this exact subject, you might want to look at his thoughts as well on
hydraulic lifters and cams in the T4 in his articles section.

Anyway sensible comments, opinions, feedback encouraged, I hope this has
been informative, sensible, and a bit light hearted on the way.  I don't
think I've made many glaring errors but I'm not as quick as I used to be.
