George, maybe I don't understand what you are saying but...

I just grabbed a brand new 65-70C t-stat and my Fluke digital thermometer
and in 120 F water it remains completely contracted.  Not until ~145 F does
it even start to open with ~160 F the point of full expansion. Outside air
temp is completely irrelevant anywhere on planet Earth, which further
indicates how mistaken those &quot;mechanics&quot; are who think t-stats are
unnecessary.

A properly adjusted t-stat keeps the flaps *closed* independently of outside
temperature when the motor has cooled down, in any climate.  They want the
motor to be at 180 oil temp ASAP and the t-stat gets it there.  If your
t-stat moves the flaps at all before the air blowing on it is 140 F or
greater, it is not set up correctly.

that's 60 degrees F outside air temperature!  At temps lower than that
they don't open fully unless the engine is producing a _lot_ of heat, as
in going uphill.
