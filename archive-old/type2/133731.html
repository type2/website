Subject: Re: [T2] TIN IS FUN

From: scott lyons

to anyone who is doing this sort of work for the first time, the book &quot;how
to rebuild your aircooled VW engine&quot; by tom wilson, is indispensable. it
covers most aspects and models....
____________________________________________________________________

Does this book cover the Air Conditioning System?

Anybody have any links to info about the Air Conditioning Systems? I am 
about to remove my compressor and posssibly the rest. I just would like to 
see some pics or shop drawings, something to give me a more visual image of 
the components related to the engine, before I start.

Thanks,

Michael Knight
