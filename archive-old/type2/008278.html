If you are putting the shifter in to fix the slop, then you will be
disapointed. Most shift slop is caused by worn shift bushings and/or
the shift coupler. The bushings are in the frame along the shift
tube(three I think) and the shift coupler is at the trans. If these
are worn, a new shifter will only look pretty. If you fix the other
sources of slop and then put in a new scat or whatever shifter, then
you will like the outcome. The custom shifters often reduce the throw
and have a better feel. I have used them in the past and loved them. I
would see if you could find someone in your area with one and see if
they will let you test drive it to see if you like it. If everthing
else is O.K. the stock shifter is just fine. Also look into the
Urithane shift couplers, they work good.
If the Type2 web page is up, there is some info on the bushings and
shifter on the site on a tech page.
