Subject: RE: [T2] Push rod tube seals...or lack there of....

&gt;the seals on the push rod tubes appears not to be working at all....they of
&gt;course leak down onto the exhaust manifold, and into the heater boxes.  I
&gt;had to disconnect my heater to keep from fixating on the fumes.   Any Ideas
&gt;on the 'best' way of installing these o-rings?  any trick to them I missed?
&gt;These are brand new...the inner o-rings (ones near the crankcase) work
&gt;fine...

I installed new push rod tube seals about 3 months ago, but the outside
seals started leaking again.  Like your experience the inner seals were
fine.  This past weekend I decided to fix them again.  Before starting the
job I climbed under the bus and wiggled the tubes back and forth to see if
this helped or hurt.  Well it definitely hurt.  I drove around the block
after wiggling the tubes back and forth and they leaked worse than ever.  I
commenced to replace them so I took them out and cleaned them up.  This time
I paid very close attention to the ones that were leaking.  I found the
flanges on the large ends of the leaking tubes were not quite as flat and
perfectly round as the non-leaking tubes.  I gently bent and smoothed these
flanges back into shape.  I then installed the o-rings and applied a film of
axle grease to make the tubes insert easier.   Don't use Vaseline, as a
friend suggested, because it damages the rubber seal. I guess he never read
the instructions found in a new box of condoms.  After inserting the push
rod tubes I tried to make certain they were inserted as fully as possible
and the wire bail under the rocker arms were seated firmly against them.
It's been a week now and the leaks are completely gone.  I have read where
other listees swear by certain brands of seals, but I just used whatever the
parts store gave me.  Good luck.
