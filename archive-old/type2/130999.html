Subject: 71 FS Cheap/AIRS Update TN...

Listees,

Today I took Danny 
(http://img7.photobucket_dot_com/albums/v18/SiouxsieQ1976/danielstuff/vws/IM001652.jpg) 
to pick up a 71 that was for sale cheap so he could get the engine out of 
it. We will be putting the engine in his Westy this weekend and getting him 
back on the road to Arizona.

So now he has this 71 that he needs to get rid of. Fast. I don't have room 
for it and although my exwife might let me store it at her house for a 
little while I really don't want to do that.

So I'm really hoping someone is interested and can possibly pick it up this 
weekend. See the ad for Dannys contact info and I don't know exactly what 
he'll take for it but I know it will be very little.

And thanks to Faster Laster for giving me the lead on that 71!
