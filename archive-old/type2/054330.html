Subject: Dead Battery... again and again and again....

Volks- SOMETHING keeps draining my battery. I pulled the positive clamp
off of the battery and put a voltmeter between the battery post and the
clamp and it read something like 12.47 volts. That's how I confirmed that
something was draining my battery. Next I put the clamp back on and went
up to the fuse box and tested each fuse connection. Two connections read
0.01 volts and one read 0.14 volts. The one that read 0.14 volts was #12,
the fuse for the horn and tail lights. Are any of these numbers something
to worry about? I took out fuse #12 and THEN took a test between the
battery post and clamp, and it STILL read 12.47 volts, so I figured that
that wasn't the problem. As of the time I took the test, the alternator
was about 2 hours old (I just put it in that night), and the starter was
about a year old. I have the hard start/ horn relay ala Hoover and Muir
for my starter, and that SEEMED to be drawing some juice, but I didn't
understand why. I can't remember what the actual numbers were or what
posts I was measuring from, but re-routed the wire from the ignition back
to the starter solenoid (from its place at the hard start solenoid,
thereby taking the hard start solenoid out of the current loop), and
STILL read a 12 volt draw from the battery. Then I realized that I had my
aftermarket tach hooked up to the positive terminal on the battery and
tested that to see what kind of juice that was drawing. It was drawing
*some* juice (like 2 or 3 volts), but after I unhooked that, I did a test
again on the battery and STILL read a 12 volt draw. AHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!
  What is going on?!?!? 
I don't know where to look next. Someone please help.
