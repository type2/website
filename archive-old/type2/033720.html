Subject: Re: wave to buses/DC area

Sure, there are more than 7, I've seen quite a few if you count the ones 
sitting in driveways/yards that are rusting away because the owner won't part 
with it, would rather wait until it's too far gone to salvage, then try to 
sell it for a ridiculous price. But, you don't see too many actually out on 
the roads. IMHO, the VW Bus/Camper is NOT the ideal commuter vehicle in the 
DC Metro area, that would be a HumVee with machine guns mounted front and 
rear.      Jeff S.
