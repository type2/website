Subject: paint job

Dude!
   Nice job!.... I voted but was torn between your bus
an the brick mailbox...but you won out in the end.
&lt;snip&gt;
I have entered my Bus in a contest through Rustoleum
(since I used
their product to paint my Bus) and have a chance to
win $100.00 if my
project gets the most votes.
