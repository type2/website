Congratulations! It's encouraging to hear this, because I've got something
similar coming up soon - I need to take the windscreen(shield) out to repair
rust below it (I saw the surround a couple of years ago when the screen was out,
and it didn't look good). I have insurance for windscreen damage, and was
considering &quot;reporting it broken&quot; if I couldn't get it back in. As a warm-up I
fitted a single piece glass to one of the side windows this weekend. (Cheap
repair to rusty quarter-light). I used &quot;Just Kampers&quot; window seal (billed as
genuine VW, although there wasn't a VW emblem, or part number on it). Does
anyone have any info on how good these are?? 

I used a panel door covered with blanket, and propped against the window to
catch the old glass as I removed it, and to stop the new glass popping out. I
found it exhausting and nerve-wracking to get the new glass in. It wasn't until
I got the last 6&quot; of cord out that the whole thing fell into place. Lots of
banging &amp; pushing. My fore-arms haven't ached so much since I last fitted my own
tyres. I used 6mm braided nylon, and swarfega.
