&gt; Tony's right about the possible dangers.  Your insurer might take a pretty
&gt; dim idea of it, too, especially if there were a fall accident.  The ones at
&gt; the oil change places have dedicated exhaust, stairwells (2), and drainage
&gt; (you can suffer a wet floor or worse, depending on your water table, if you
&gt; don't).
&gt; 
&gt; Sure would be nice for oil changes and valve adjustments, though, wouldn't
&gt; it?
