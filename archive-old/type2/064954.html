Subject: Re: The People Have Spoken: [was: Ignit. relay, condenser short]

&gt;       100% of the respondents agreed that it would.  Some advised 
&gt;       replacing the condenser, and Ron Van Ness suggested a razor 
&gt;       blade--for the little boot at the bottom of the distributor!
&gt;       --and a screwdriver, though I'm not sure if he meant the tool 
&gt;       or the drink.  Have to go back and re-read his note.

Bill,

In case my previous post was too vague, there is a special tool you can buy
to drive in the plastic plug on the condensor wire that fits in the
distributor housing.  I chose not to buy/replicate this tool.  I install a
new condensor by shaving the diameter of that plastic plug with a razor
blade so it will slide in the hole in the distributor (but still fit snugly)
and then I press it into the hole in the distributor (which I've removed
from the engine) by using a screwdriver along the plug edges.

I don't think you have to replace your condensor--just seat that plug well,
drive away happy, and wait for your next minor catastophy.
