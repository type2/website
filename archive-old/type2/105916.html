Billy:

Understand a couple of things:

1) The readings from the O2 sensor *won't* be .5V when you've got it right.
The output from the O2 sensor plotted against air/fuel ratio is a *very*
steep &quot;S&quot; shaped curve with the steepest part of the curve being right
around .5V.  What you should expect to see is a rapid fluctuation of the
voltage above and below .5V; you just kind of have to judge when it
more-or-less averages .5V and call that &quot;good enough.&quot;

2) You may find that you *can't* lean out the mixture enough to get the .5V
you seek.  As the internal spring which resists the movement of the air vane
in the AFM weakens over time you can come to a point where the adjustment
screw just can't compensate enough.  This calls for either a reman AFM or
for you to do surgery on the AFM to tighten up the spring.  Again, this
procedure is well described in the archives.

&gt; Richard, Larry, Tom, and others who replied, thanks for your posts
&gt; they've been very helpful.
&gt;
&gt; I guess I should:
&gt;
&gt; 1. Get a new bosch 02 sensor installed
&gt; 2. Meter the single 02 wire to ground looking for 0.5V
&gt; 3. Adjust the mixture screw, making note of its current setting, to
&gt;    achieve the 0.5V
&gt; 4. Check my VIN against the DMV records
&gt; 5. Go to the ref for the engine swap sticker, et al.
&gt; 6. Go to a VW shop and have the test done unofficially to make sure
&gt;    I pass.
&gt; 7. Go for retest.
