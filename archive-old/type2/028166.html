Dear fellow listees,

    Hi, it's Yucel Kuday (aka. the poor college Student), and I am in search 
of an engine I can put into my 73 camper.  I guess I would even put a 
1600(perfer 1700,1800, or the 2000 fi holy grail(at least for me)) into the 
damn bus.  Does anyone have an engine laying around, it does not have to be 
complete I can do minor work on it.  I live in NJ so I would have to be able 
to pick it up.  hey let me know.  Don't forget I am a poor college student 
so if you have a new or rebuilt engine I can't afford it.

Peace,

Yucel
