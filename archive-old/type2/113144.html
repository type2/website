Subject: 228mm Flywheel Resurface Question

Hi All:

I am thinking about having my 228mm original flywheel resurfaced before
I reinstall it. It seems to be in good shape (no burn marks), but the
old clutch disk was pretty worn (loose rivets) and it might be nice to
start off with everything in its best shape.

My question: Does anyone know the wear specifications on the flywheel?
How much can be taken off the surface and how much material should be
left before the flywheel is no longer any good?  What should the
distance be between the flywheel clutch surface and the pressure plate
mounting surface (max, min)?

I have looked in my Bentleys, but did not see anything that addressed
this.

Regards,
