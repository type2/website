 &gt; &gt; With the performance improvements you're planning I think you'd be
 &gt; &gt; putting yourself at risk from the suspension if you make the brakes
 &gt; &gt; any better.

It's a truck, fer crissakes...Yes, I'd like more power pulling a hill, but
that suspension was designed 50 years ago...It's never gonna be up
to modern speeds and handling. It's simple physics; you've got a top
and tail heavy box... Push the envelope and you're gonna be watchin'
the sky in your rear view mirror... ;-(
------------------------

Even though the factory changed to bigger front calipers/pads after '71, I've 
never felt that my '71 Kombi was lacking in the braking department, even in a 
panic stop at speed. I've replaced the rotors once and rebuilt the calipers many 
years ago.

Recently I bought a set of (ACEI) calipers from speedycarparts_dot_com for $130 
(plus $80 core).  To my surprise they appear to be brand new, not rebuilt, and 
the apparent quality of the casting, plated metal and rubber parts seem up to 
ATE standards.  http://tinyurl_dot_com/gggcu

As far as the suspension of the loafs goes:  I added larger sway bars (front and 
rear) from Addco years ago, and had a custom wheel shop combine my stock rear 
14&quot; rims with a pair of Mercedes rims from the junkyard to increase the wheel 
width about one and 1/2 inches.  Coupled with a full set of Bilstein shocks and 
larger tires, I can only say that the overall feel and handling at all speeds 
puts many modern trucks and suv's in the shade.  Changing crowded lanes on the 
Interstate, or pushing through a quartering headwind is substantially improved.
