Subject: Re: [T2] Importing German-spec Eurovan into the US -help
To: type2_at_type2_dot_com

There were no EuroVans sold here in the US in '94.  The EV was offered in '93 
and then not again until '99.  In '95, '97, '99 and '00 Winnebago offered the 
EV camper.  The '93 and '95 models had the 5 cylinder engines, and the VR6 
was added to the '97 and up.  There were no 4 cylinders offered for the EV in 
the US.

I suggest you get an expert opinion before you attempt to import such a 
vehicle.  My understanding is that you can't bring in a model that wasn't 
offered here in the US, the year the vehicle was sold.
