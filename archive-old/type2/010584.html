&gt; Jack-a-Roe,
&gt; 
&gt; The arms are not specific to which cylinder they are over, but they are
&gt; specific to which valve they are over - exhaust or intake. 
&gt; 
&gt; I believe the one with more 'meat' between the arm and the bearing part
goes
&gt; over the intake, but i could be wrong - no visual reference available now. 

&gt; If you install them wrong, the adjuster screw will not line up correctly
over
&gt; the valve stem.  It is fairly obvious when you have the wrong arm over the
&gt; wrong valve.  Compare the rocker amrs and notice the differences.
&gt; 
&gt; Does this make sense to you?  Look at your arms - check your bentley.
&gt; 
&gt; I'd say you have them wrong. - i almost did it wrong till my local VW guru
&gt; said &quot;No! They ARE different!&quot;  You probably haven't damaged anything but
&gt; maybe an adjuster screw or two...

&gt; &gt; Hi listers---
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I finally got my poor old 74 Westfalia to run (I rebuilt the engine, got
&gt; &gt; it in, it was backfiring a lot--got enough advise from the group to get
&gt; &gt; it sputtering). But it's not really running good enough to drive (or
&gt; &gt; even idle, or, well even speed up).
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; So I know I have some carb adjustment to do. But before going there, I'm
&gt; &gt; concerned about my rocker arms. It seems that on some cylinders, the
&gt; &gt; rocker arm itself easily clears the valve spring, but on others, it the
&gt; &gt; curved part of the arm is touching the spring. I'm afraid this is not
&gt; &gt; letting the valve close completely.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; It's a 1.8 L.  Are the rocker arm assembly specific to the cylinders? I
&gt; &gt; had seperated them out carefully, but my neighbors dog ran though the
&gt; &gt; shop and scattered them across the floor while I was putting it back
&gt; &gt; together.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Any help (and quick help if possible since I'm going out to work on it
&gt; &gt; in about an hour) would be very appreciated.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Thanks
