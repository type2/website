Subject: Re: [T2] re: Low oil pressure at idle

Also the source of many mysterious oil leaks that you cant seem to 
find.  This same pressure sender was used all the way up into the 90's 
waterboxers.  same problems when they age and you get oil where it 
shouldnt be.  On my type 4 even a dye test made it look like i was 
leaking from the oil cooler base. until i happened to get the light to 
the top of the engine while i was looking at something else.

&gt; Try switching to straight 40W or 50W Valvoline Racing Oil. It's too

&gt; the warmer months.
&gt; Also check the electrical connection on the oil pressure sender, which 
&gt; is located at about the 10 o'clock position from the distributor as you 
&gt; look at it from behind and above the engine. The oil pressure sender 
&gt; sometimes cracks and leaks oil and may eventually blow, sending a 
&gt; gusher of oil all over the engine. It's cheap to replace, about $9 or 
&gt; so.
