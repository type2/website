&gt; &gt; You would be amazed at how many of your so called German gaskets are
&gt; &gt; actually Brazil or Mexico (even India) repackaged or just called
German...
&gt;
&gt; In addition, German rubber isn't exactly the best available.  It is
adequate, but it seems that the stuff that comes on American and
&gt; Japanese cars is much more resistant to UV and ozone deterioration.  I
think the important thing is the molding and formulation, not
&gt; where the rubber was made.  We lean on guys like Ronnie to do our research
for us so we don't get stung with the junk.
