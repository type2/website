Community colleges often offer welding classes. I learned to weld as part of an Industrial engineering degree at http://www.tntech_dot_edu/mit/ (4 year school). 

There is a proper adhesive type repair material now. Is meant to glue on steel to steel patch panels. Apparently the good stuff and not a close approximation like the surf board stuff MAY be. Check with your local auto body supply store. Every town has 2-3 of them at least, even my small town in TN.
