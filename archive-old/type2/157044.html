Subject: Re: [T2] questions about sliding windows on a late bay

Thanks, Mike.  I definitely have this problem.  Is there an  easy fix or is it even worth messing with?  Would it be difficult  to just cut off the slack or even replace the cord or whatever is used  to tighten them?  I have never even had the panel off to see how  they work.  Cheers...KR

then go out and lift the slats up considerably- this is due to them 
being driven open- the wind vibrates them and the gear or window rivets 
or connecting rod rivets wear.  You notice this when you close them- if 
you must turn and turn AFTER they hit their seals to make them really 
tight, you are taking up the wear slack.
