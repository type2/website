Subject: RE: Question about VW Things

&gt;Type 181s (VW's model number for the &quot;Thing&quot;) used the old bus =
&gt;transmission with the swing axle/reduction boxes through 1972. From 1973 =
&gt;to the end of the production, the 181 used the CV joint transmission =
&gt;from the Bug.

OK-
This may be a stupid question, but what was the production run
for Things?  In the US, they were only sold as '73 and '74 
models, and I've never seen a thing with CVs.  WCM doesn't
even list any parts except for swing axles w/redux boxes.

Maybe I'm missing the point, maybe I don't have a clue.

Just curious,
