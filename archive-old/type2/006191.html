&gt;Folks,
&gt;I have a 78 camper interior for sale which includes Z-bed,
sink/stove/fridge
unit, under sliding door gas tank, voltage inverter w/dual battery hookup,
overhead cabinet and side cabinets. I will sell the package for $450.00. The
fabric on the rear seat/zbed is not ripped, but is quite old and needs
replacing.
I also have a single zbed unit alone, from a 1971 campmobile for $150.00.
Needs upholtery and cushions.
