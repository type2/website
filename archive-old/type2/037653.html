Content-Disposition: inline

Progress on 72 bus that was stored for 10 years in a garage that also doubled as
a marsh:

Well each bolt holding the shapeshifting transmission/motor is a small victory.
Last night I removed 6 and stripped 2. I got the rear upper mounts and the two
on the front mount, as well as 4 of 6 cv's on the outboard drive side axle. the
other two stripped. Tonight I go for the 6 on the right side, plus the two
stripped ones on the left, after which, the whole monstrosity will
be lowerable and removeable. Once I get it out I'll cut the good parts off like
a butcher and throw the rest in the dumpster.
