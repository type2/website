Subject: Re replacing old hyd lifters with new(the 231K bus)

Regarding the necessity (Jack Raby?) of matching new cams with new
lifters:
What, you mean that I shouldn't have gone 131,000 mi on the hyd lifters
replaced around 100K by a local mechanic who claimed I needed them after
I was noticing clatter and was ignorant about just letting them pump
up?  Obviously they were not matched any more to the old cam????

I speak partly in jest, since I agree a cam and lifter wear together-I
remember very long ago taking apart a (bug?) engine and noticing the
wear visible in the lifter which obviously was matching the wear in the
cam lobe.  I recall using very crude tools to machine the case to allow
later, thicker lifters to fit, as the older ones were in danger of
manufacturing &quot;washers&quot; (:  Obviously adding an old to a new would
increase wear as some surfaces will be under a greater load than
before!  So is there any advice regarding replacing hyd lifters (which
is very easy)- such as if the old has a flat surface it's OK??
