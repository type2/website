Subject: Re: [T2] Heater

You may drive barefoot in Hawaii if you care to.  Also you will not need 
heat except on top of the two volcanos you can drive to.  They are 
10,000  and 13,000 feet.

&gt;By the way, in most [maybe all] the US states it's illegal to drive barefoot for safety reasons.  Haven't any idea what the regulations might be in Australia, but I expect they are more lenient than ours...
