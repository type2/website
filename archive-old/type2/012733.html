&gt; Question #1 What is the name of the seal that is right behind the clutch 
&gt; lever arm that pushes the throw out bearing called? And can this seal be 
&gt; replaced without taking the tranny apart? 

Rear Transmission Seal (IIRC), and yes it can be replaced without disassembling
the tranny.

&gt; Question #2 Does anyone know of a good manual to walk me through opening the 
&gt; transaxle, if necessary? 

*shudder*

Bentley provides reasonable instructions for replacing the seal w/o having
to open the transaxle.  :)
