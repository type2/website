First the BAD:
Forget the fire extinguisher... if you catch the fire in time the fire
extinguisher MAY work... other wise get several... or one HUGE one.

THE REASON: Our busses are GRAVITY FEED systems... meaning it don't stop
burning (once lit) until all the fuel has been drained from the tank. As a
VETERAN of two fires... I know this well. 1 mine... the other a motorists.
BEST INSURANCE: Braided hoses, constant inspection, or an electric fuel pump
drawing from the top of the tank.

THE GOOD: Great vehicle for removing parts from (if their not melted)... no
grease to work through. Just some minor rust. I just stripped a Chrysler
LeBaron of the Turbo II motor and it was a joy to work on... could have done
the entire job in a white three piece suite with no fear... LOL (and all the
wiring was out of the way also)....ROFL
