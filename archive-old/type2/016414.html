Subject: Curtains For Sale

Hey All,

Just finishing up my resto '70 Camper and I decided to replace the
original yellow, brown and white curtains.
All the curtains are there but the PO left the bus sitting out in a
field for 7 years and a couple of them are sun damaged and quite
brittle.  The windsheild peice is mint and some of the others are in not
bad shape.  I used all the plastic thingys (that slide into the tracks
on the driver/passenger and sliding door windows) for my new curtains.
I will sell or trade or whatever...pmail me if you're interested...

Derek, if you are reading this..the fuse panel is on its way!

See Ya,
