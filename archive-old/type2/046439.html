Subject: [T2] Road trip to NM/AZ

hi all,

My girlfriend and i are heading out to arizona and new mexico for a couple
of weeks. We leave this friday after work.

We will be at a concert in Phoenix this sunday, and at busses and baloons
the next weekend, other than that we dont have any specific plans... we
are thinking that we will explore AZ next week and NM the week after...

Any suggestions of cool offbeat stuff to see will be appreciated...

take care,

Steve
