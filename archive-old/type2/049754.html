First, and update on the Vanagon Carat wheels.  These four wheels were 
pulled from a junker by Nick, a young Englishman who is returning to England 
next week.  He is anxious to get rid of them, since he ha shipped his 1986 
Vanagon Camper last week.  He go the '86 Camper from California because he 
intended to ship a camper back to England and tour the continent.  He will 
spend Xmas in Madrid with his wife's relatives.

Three of the four tires are trash, and probably the fourth, although it does 
have excellent thread.
These is no 'caps' nor lug nuts, so these would be an additional cost.

The bodies of the Vanagon Carat wheels seem excellent, and there is only 5 
or 6 small nicks (total on all 4 wheels) on the edge.  I saw only three 
small nicks last night.

I have just completed my wheel/tire phase with four Yoko 8 ply tires, and I 
don't want to do a swap now.

Supposidly, they will fit '71 to '83+ air cooled type 2, but I did not try 
them on.

New!!  Posted in the local nickle paper::

##  VW Parts:  1971 camper bus parts (703) 387 7999  (no prices listed)

## Volkswagen:  Pancake engine, manty parts.  $50 all  (540) 984 8878

AND BY THE WAY, I AM STILL LOOKING FOR SAGE GREEN CAMPER DOORS (2 FRONT AND 
SLIDER) FOR MY '78 CAMPER.  MUST BE OUTSTANDING CONDITION AND RUST FREE.  
And yes, I AM shouting!!
