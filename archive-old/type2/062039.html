        This in no necessarly true.  As long as you stay under apx. 100mW
you can transmitt almost anywhere that you want (this is why the wireless
microphone's are legal).  This has a lot to do with the proublem that any
clocked electronic device (car radio, computer, ect.) WILL transmitt a
recievable radio signal (these are what a scanner manufacturer will call
birdes).  These are caused by the (in a brodcast bandreciever) hetrodineing
circuit and the harmonics of the hetrodineing Fr.

        Back to the point.  Ramsey Electronics (I am not related to this co.
in any way) sells both radar detector 'testers' and full radar speed
detectors (in both kit and completed form).(you may need to check state and
local laws before useing these devices on a public roadway.  The previous
paragraph deals only with FCC reg's(who have the SOLE authority when dealing
with radio transmitting devices, but some states write laws anyways(ie.
Calif. attempting to repeal the basic laws ot thermodynamics)))

        What the law that you are refering to is related to the installing
of a high powered transmitter into a car that would cause a speed detctor to
always see some pre selected speed (that is illegal, and kind of useless in
a VW bus).
