Subject: FT: 91 Golf GL for T4 bus OEV (in WV)

Basically subject says it all I will trade a '91 Golf GL, 4 door, 
automatic, showing 149k but title states not actual mileage (I have no 
idea of reason) for a bus OEV.  The engine was just replaced with an 
84k mile '92 8V GTI engine (I saw the car it came out of with 88k miles 
on the clock, it was taken out of the '92 to install a crossflow 2.0 
not for any bad reason) which has 165-175 psi compression across the 
board, runs very very strong.  Includes spare Digifant ECU, Digifant 
AFM, spare fuel rail, spare dizzy, some other spare engine odds and 
ends.  Car had left front fender a bit crumpled, was replaced with one 
from my old '85 GTI, has no frame damage, I will probably repaint the 
entire car (white) before trade, will be an average backyard job, I'm 
fairly proficient but don't intend to blow much time prepping for 
perfection, will use catalyzed acrylic enamel (should equal around a 
$1000 commercial job.)  Anyway new brakes all round, including new ATE 
power disc front rotors, new rear wheel cylinders, all new premium 
linings, new master cylinder (sat with R front line off for a year, 
don't ask)  Interior is in good conditions, seats and carpet are nearly 
perfect, was smoked in, headliner is falling down all over (common 
Mexi-golf problem) I may glue it back up, I may not.  Has sunroof, 
operates well.  No options other than the sunroof, tilt steering, and 
the automatic, pretty basic car.  Normal amount of trim bits 
missing/broken here and there, normal outside fender dents and dings, I 
may fix some of them before the paint I may not.  I will also provide 
spare windshield, heater/AC cores and blower, rear hatch with wiper, 
and perhaps 4 very nice Yoko snows on early VW alloys.  Currently has 4 
different tires all with good tread on aftermarket alloys.  Generally a 
fair running, fair condition used Golf, ideal winter transport, ideal 
commuter/student car.

Sorry that was long winded, now for the point.  I figure it is worth 
somwhere between $2000 and $3000 depending how well I do the paint, I 
want a T4 powered Bus, prefer a '76-'79 7 or 9 passenger.  Body can be 
tarnished/sunburnt but must be RUST FREE, and I mean it, slight impact 
damage is acceptable.  I would like it to run with fair mechanicals, 
engine above 100 psi on all four.  I will of course take a Westy but 
actually prefer a Deluxe, and will consider '72-'75.  Must be within 
reasonable driving distance of WV so we can meet and exchange vehicles 
at a half way point.  I will consider a non running vehicle if engine 
or transmission failed but it was running within the last 6 months if 
it has an IMPECCABLE body, but in order for me to come and tow it back 
and give you the car, it will have to be perfect body or a Westy, etc.

Anyway if anyone is interested, has a nice bus but can't afford to 
maintain it or blew the engine and needs some wheels, here is the 
chance.  I'm looking to do this in about a month, after I paint the 
Golf, we can exchange pics at that time and work out details.

Thanks for bearing with me.
John
