Subject: re: correct carbs for 73 

Hi Don,

 If you are comparing a pair of webers to a pair of solex's - try counting
how many screws it takes to tune both - not to mention whether or not the
electo-magnetic cut-offs are working. I hope the throttle plate bushings are
in good shape, too - have you looked into what it costs to get them rebushed
if they're leaking? Sure mint condition carbs work well - but when was the
last time you saw a 30 year old pair mint condition solex carbs for a 73. If
you want to give it a try - go for it.
