Subject: Re:Serious suspension problem...rust
X-Diagnostic: MESSAGE MAY NOT BE TOPICAL

Dang!!! I found a day-ruiner on China Cat. This is my son's 75 Westy.

Removed all the wheels to start on brake reconditioning and discovered rot in 
the front suspension.

I'm looking into the underside of the front driver's side wheel well, and 
what grins at me but rust...rot...rust-through. It is on the large plate that 
holds the trailing arms, the shock, and the post that sticks out with the 
rubber snubbers on it.

The rust is in an S-shape, starting in front of that post, running down under 
it and then curving around and under the lower torsion tube &quot;mouth&quot;. Only 
about 15% of the lower tube has solid metal around it.

Is this something that can be repaired with weld while in place? What is the 
best fix?

I'd like to hear about the entire range of available fixes. I usually end up 
using the &quot;best&quot; fix, but I do like to hear about the groups experiences with 
different techniques.

As always, your fine answers are appreciated.

Cheers/Don Carron
