To the great list members who answered my starting problem of yesterday, 
thank you.

The answer to:

&gt;My '78 2.0L fuel injected Bus won't start.  It turns over, fires, runs for
&gt;two seconds then dies.  If I give it gas it will idle high for ~6 seconds
&gt;and then will die independent of my right foot.  It has gas in the tank.
&gt;I can repeat this indefinitely.
&gt;
&gt;I recently had a new right head installed and it had been running great
&gt;ever since (July, about 200 miles). It also has a new fuel filter/plugs.

was, in fact, two disconnected vacuum tubes coming from my crankcase breather 
and my aux. air valve.  How they both came off at the same time is wierd.

Thanks again,

Rich Muller
