&gt; I can't tighten down the exhaust headers at the heads on my 1976 2 liter

&gt; I get this problem solved without taking the heads off and moving them to a

&gt; Another idea the mechanic had was to drop the whole engine, drain the oil, 
&gt; and take the whole thing into the machine shop, where it could be flipped 
&gt; upside down and the helicoils installed without removing the heads.

There's no real trick to installing Helicoils.  You drill the stripped
hole out with the correct size drill, tap it with the supplied tap, and
screw in the helicoil.  A machinist could probably do it best, but I've
done a few with good results.
