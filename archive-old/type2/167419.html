&gt; knew this till recently at a shop here in fl there
&gt; was a post 72 bus with a &quot;bug&quot; engine in it.  It looked factory  
&gt; with the sheet metal and seals. That seems to be my
&gt; thought on the engine claim.
&gt; probably he just does not know his type 2 or may be much else
&gt; when is a splitie not a splittie?

It was the other way around in Europe: bug engine by default and the  
Type 4 was an extra cost. In USA/Canada there were no engine options  
and the Type 4 was the defacto engine.

Either that bus came from Europe or the parts have been collected and  
the engine conversion has been well done. Check the export code on  
the m-plate if you seen that bus again.
