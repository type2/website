&gt; Hello Tony, the tricks I learned for soldering batteries in my electric
&gt; model airplane days as recommended by the pros: First, use a really
&gt; large soldering iron. You don't want to wait for the heat to penetrate
&gt; the battery, so the pencil and gun types won't work. Second, prep the
&gt; joint by tinning the tabs you will be using and lightly sanding the
&gt; battery in the area to be soldered. Apply some rosin to the sanded spot,
&gt; you are using rosin core solder? Acid core is for plumbing and will
&gt; cause problems if used in an electronic application. Third, line
&gt; everything up, build a jig to hold the batteries, or get a third hand,
&gt; and do it quick!  The wee bit of extra solder on the pre-tinned tabs
&gt; will let you know when it melts by moving slightly. Hobby supply stores
&gt; or Radio Shack should sell tabs designed for this. Hope this helps, Timo
&gt;
&gt;
Thanks for all the replies...Got plenty of old batteries to practice
with...;-)

BTW, my buddy bought an 18V Craftsman from Sears a while ago and
when the &quot;same&quot; kit went on sale, he bought another...Wrong! Same
looking kit, but the factory in Taiwan musta been changed 'cause the
gun looks the same but the batteries aren't interchangeable...Grrr...;-(
