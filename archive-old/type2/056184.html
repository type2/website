Subject: Converting Bread Loaf Hardtop to Pop Top

In process of fulfilling 25+ year dream of having VW camper and have been
reading this list for the past few months.  I'm considering a  '78 or '79
Westy as my ideal candidate based on their engine and interior.  In
searching the want ads, these Westys are fetching a decent price, so the
question I'm  asking myself and the list is, would it be possible to take a
hardtop bus to a convertor and have them cut open the roof and install a
Westy (or other) poptop?  This might be cheaper (?) and allow me to complete
the interior to my specs, not Westfalias.  BUT, I would not want to
compromise the bus's structural strength or performance. Hope this isn't
blasphemy, but some of the Westy features are must-haves (e.g. pop-top for
standing room, upper/lower berths) and others aren't (e.g. indoor stove and
sink).  Comments supporting or diagreeing with this idea are welcome.  

TIA
