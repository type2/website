Subject: Bus-Related Acronyms

Hi Folks,

For those of you looking for the Bus-related acronyms in the Type2_dot_com 
Library, look here:

www.type2_dot_com
Library link
A section
Acronym Dictionary entry
Bus Terminology, Slang, Mailing List Acronyms and Jargon link
(5th link from top under General)

The Type2_dot_com Library is good, and I knew it had the dictionary in there 
somewhere, it was just a matter of finding it.  BTW, AC is not listed in 
there, but is usually an abbreviation for Air-Cooled when it's not an 
abbreviation for Air Conditioning.

Good Luck!
