&gt; 
&gt; Of course, the TuV is a bit, shall we say, draconian, with their edicts by
&gt; US standards.  There are quite a few modifications done routinely in the
&gt; US that would never make it onto a German roadway!

Having heard credible accounts of a Vanagon Synchro Crewcab fitted
with a V 10 TDI engine (five litres, 313 hp, out of a Phaeton or
Touareg), I dare doubt that.  The TUeV has loosened up quite a bit
in the last couple decades with regard to what is and what isn't
possible.  They seem to have a &quot;if you're gonna do it, do it right&quot;
policy now.

Airhowlingly yours,
