&gt; I am hoping someone here has experience getting extra insurance for their
&gt; &quot;historic&quot; VW's. I have asked several &quot;historic&quot; or &quot;classic&quot; insurance
&gt; companies, but they will not insure my westy. Either because it is a camper
&gt; or that I want to actually use it! So my question to the group is who are
&gt; you folks getting insurance from? Many of you have put a fair bit of money
&gt; into restoring VW's how are you insuring them? Any help would be
&gt; appreciated, oh by the way I live in MD in case someone knows that their
&gt; company has a license to sell insurance in MD.

I have a 78 in MD and it is my daily driver.   I have MetLife auto
insurance (yeah Snoopy insurance) have my bus on same policy with wife's
car.  I have an assigned value policy along with collision policy and it
added about $200 a year to the policy ($8,500) I have not had to use em
but have had no problems in the 3 years I have had the insurance

this policy was less than putting my van on wifes State Farm or her car on
my Maryland Casualty policy

YMMV
