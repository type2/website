&gt; I've come damn close, Dolan muttered something about having done
&gt; it.  But, rubber $30, windshield at LEAST $100, cut the seal volks,
&gt; all the way round, all the way back till you see the edge of the glass
&gt; all the way round.  Then pound real gently.

Dolan sez:  I have removed a windshield without cutting the seal.  Take a
handful of butter knives (.10/per at the thrift shop) run one around the
outside between the seal and the body to break the seal free, adding soapy
water as lube. Next, take that handful of knives inside and prop a knife
every 6&quot; on the lip to pry the lip away from the flange.  Then two people
in sneakers press gently against the inside of the glass to push it out.  
It can be done!

That said, it was not worth it.  I would cut the seal on a bay.  The risk
vs. reward is not high enough to justify the excercise.  A new seal is
$20, a new windshield is at least $70 (I am more used to $100).  On a
V'gon, where the seal is $60 vs. new glass at $100, a case might be made,
of course...  (sorry, that was just ribbing John :-)
