&gt; Why isn't temp a relative constant?  With increased RPM, the fan
&gt; would most certainly be turning faster, and the engine would be
&gt; enjoying a greater amount of cooling air, but would not the
&gt; engine also be creating equivalently MORE heat to be dissipated
&gt; (increased RPM = increased combustion).

It isn't certain that the air flow is linear with the fan speed.  In order
to have reasonable cooling at low engine speeds, the fan has to be sized
to move a lot of air even then.  At higher engine speeds the flow is
choked by the finning area, so the increase in air flow isn't as
large as you might think.

It may well be that spinning the engine faster makes it run hotter if it
is under load.  My rule of thumb is never to run the engine at WOT uphill
if the outside temps are over 80.  I run about 3/4 throttle and shift down
when appropriate
