&gt;Well, you made me go out an crawl under the truck. %^)

&gt;On mine, there's a wire from the horn which runs up through the floorboard
&gt;at the steering column and is attached to it (the outer &quot;sleeve&quot;) at the
&gt;bottom with a push-on connector. Since the outer part of the column does
&gt;not rotate, no problem. (This is the wire &quot;seeking ground.&quot; The other wire
&gt;from the horn is the hot wire which goes up to the fuse.)

&gt;Where the wire from the button is connected is a mystery to me, and I'm not
&gt;inclined to tear the thing apart just to find out how it works. (If it
&gt;works, don't fix it.) But it must lead to ground, if my memory of replacing
&gt;the horn button &quot;innards&quot; serves correctly.

Peter:

Thanks for crawling under, your observations were all correct.  Unfortunately,
I remain stumped.  The connection from the horn button after it passes through
the big rubber steering coupling is where the mystery lies.  This wire *should*
be visible from underneath with the big protective plate removed, but perhaps
the steering box blocks the view? : (

I'm beginning to think I may just use a little more wire than necessary (to
allow
for the turning of the steering wheel), and hope for the best. 8|

Again, thanks for crawling.
