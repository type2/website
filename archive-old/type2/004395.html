All manuals I've seen have said &quot;support the transmission&quot; though, as
pointed out, they *are* self-supporting to the extent that if you
don't support it it's not going to fall to the ground when you remove
the engine.

I've always supported the trans with a spare jackstand.  The trans
isn't all that heavy so most anything will do here.

&gt; Removing Type IV engine from 78 bus for first time.  It is unclear
to me if the transmission must be supported while removing the engine.
What is the best method of doing this while pulling the engine back
from the tranny with a floorjack?  Any suggestions on this matter
would be greatly appreciated.  Thanks, Chad
