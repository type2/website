Subject: anti-roll bar/stabaliser bar

Dear All,

the anti-rollbar/stabiliser bar on my 79 baywindow camper has sheered where
it connects to the lower torsion arm.

Is this uncommon and should I worry about any other components on the front
suspension and steering, or is it just one of those things that happens.

I would appreciate any help.

I assume it is safe to drive carefully.

Thankyou.
