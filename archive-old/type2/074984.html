Subject: Re: [T2] rear end hangs low! (no, not mine!)



&gt; You need to adjust or more likely replace you torsion bars. Over 
time they 
&gt; sag. If your bus is high mileage I would recommend replacing, the 
parts are 
&gt; only about $200.
&gt; 
&gt; After adjusting the originals they tend to break.

I'd love to see some of these broken torsion bars.  My bus has over 
100K miles, including a lot of dirt, since I readjusted my original, 
stock bars and they still haven't broken.  Neither have any other 
readjusted bars I've heard of on the list.  Has anyone here personally 
broken a readjusted torsion bar?
