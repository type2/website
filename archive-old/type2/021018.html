   Gee, George, as a physiscist I know you understand all too well the
principles of intertia and momentum- would you actually let someone ride
on the ice chest?  I'm not playing holier than thou, when my wife drove
I sometimes had to ride on the garbageseat between the front seats, but
that was my choice.  Before I put in the triple bedseat and had to
myself also carry 3 of my daughter's friends, I'd put my daughter back
behind the bedseat lying down with lots of bedding around her.  Not much
help in a rollover, but of some use in case of a sudden deacceleration! 
For sleeping while traveling, I designed and sewed a nylon fabric wall
that ran from its fastening under the front of the bedseat up to a chain
that went through a complete tube of the fabric to large eyebolts which
are permanently affixed to the sides of the roofbed structural span.  
The loop at the bottom is held by a rod that slips through the large
seatbrackets right under the seat.  One can also utilize the lapbelt for
the sleeping passenger.  Before that I folded up the front of the
bedseat and chained it upright to the same eyebolts.  I've even carried
my mother in a wheelchair when she was alive by strapping it to the back
of the front seat.  Pics can be emailed on request.
