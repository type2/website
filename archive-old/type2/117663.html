Subject: Re: [T2] Dual Temp Sender Data

Chris,

&quot;What we have here, is a failure of confidence&quot;  LOL!

Pull both out and stick them in boiling water at the same time.
Don't guess, go test.

If they both read 212 degrees or close depending on your altitude, then 
you have a difference in temp depending on location...other results
may indicate difference in accuracy.

So, where do other manufacturers put their oil temp sensors?????

Think it over, oil gets picked up from the bottom of the sump, so is that 
really the &quot;true real&quot; temperature?....I think probably so.  By the time
it goes thru the pump, it has already picked up some heat from the case 
and pump....or is the temp *after* the cooler, before it hits the 
bearings.

I've always been a little fuzzy on the oil path, but think it over.
On the other hand, sump temps may not be &quot;real&quot; after all...you are 
wanting to protect the bearings, so shouldn't you be looking at the temps
before it hits the bearings???....or does it really matter since it seems 
that everyone talks oil temps in relationship to sump temps.

So many options, so little time.  Might be **really** interesting to
instrument up a t1 and t4 engine and see how well the oil cooler really
works by comparing the before and after temps....

Cheers, dave

&gt; Hi,
&gt; 
&gt; Dipstick 210 225 F
&gt; Sump      185 200 F
&gt; O/P        34ish PSI
&gt; 
&gt; Is the disparity between the two sender locations consistent with 
&gt; others who have run dual senders?
&gt; 
&gt; Is the oil in the two locations at different temperature?
&gt; 
&gt; Does the sump sender get cooled by air passing under the bus?
&gt; 
&gt; Does the dipstick sender pick up heat from the engine? It is darn 
&gt; close to the heat riser and generator.
&gt; Thanks
