Sirs:

I have become aware of a situation with your company and feel compelled
to write.

It has come to my attention that your company has pursued legal action
against certain suppliers of classic VW restoration parts.  If your
company sold the parts themselves, I could at least partially understand
your position.
However, these retailers are selling parts for CLASSIC VW's that
Volkswagen of America either no longer carries or have priced themselves
out of the market with.  They do not try to fool consumers into thinking
that they are buying Volkswagen made or approved parts, rather they
appear as a source of products that we as classic VW owners need to
preserve the usability and enjoyability of our prized classic
automobiles.

As a third generation Volkswagen owner I must appeal to you to cease
this reckless pursuit of these suppliers.  Trying to dry up the parts
market for these classic VWs will not make us all go out and buy new
VWs, rather it will turn us away from the corporate monster that has
become Volkswagen of America.

Please re-consider your position in this matter and act in a way that
will make us proud to be associated with the name Volkswagen.

Thank you for your time.
