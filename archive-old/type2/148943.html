Subject: Fri- Hey Seattle Bus folks

I haven't posted for a while, I have been plugging away on the electrical
and such in my Westy. This weekend I plan to drop the engine, and pull the
gas tank to prep for torching off the rusty corner and such. There have been
a few times I could have used an extra set of hands, but I have found most
of the bus/VW clubs in the area are more of a social thing. I have talked to
a few other Bus owners and they have found the same thing. I'd like to get
some of the Seattle area Bus owners together so we can actually help each
other with our rides, not drink beer and talk about them. If you're in
Seattle and are interested in this please send me an email. In a couple
weeks we can all meet and figure out what everybody needs help with and what
sort of skill/knowledge base the group has. Then we combine resources and
make some happy VWs.
