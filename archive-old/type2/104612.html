Subject: Re: [T2] Air Cooled Classics Porsche in Knoxville, TN

&gt;&gt; Has anyone ever dealt with &quot;Air Cooled Classics Porsche&quot; in
&gt;&gt; Knoxville, TN?  The guy seemed very curteous and knowledgable on the

Are these the guys who do the Super-Charger rebuilds on 911s? If so, they are
top-notch. My best friend drives a BMW 740i and just started going to a
mechanic who primarily does Porsches (the guy had a yellow 944 that his wife
totalled - was out back someplace). I can find out details but I know this guy
was charging very fair prices for Bimmer service and appeared to be doing good
work...

BTW, my friend is using Synthetic oil in his 740 (less than 50K miles). I told
him to save his used oil when he gets it changed so I can put it in my bus ;)
The 740 evidently uses about 10 quarts and he's changing every 10K miles. The
stuff comes out of the engine looking like it just came out of the bottle...
