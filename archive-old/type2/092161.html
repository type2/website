Subject: Re: [T2] Fuel leaks!!

Richard,

I sure sounds to me like your float level is high.  I don't have much
experience with those carbs (yet) but looking at the exploded view, I
can't think of anything else.

It would follow that this is happening right after a rebuild.  Maybe you
got the wrong measurement when setting them.

Let us know what you find

Good luck!

&gt; needle and seats (the proper German ball type).
&gt; Is this normal?? I have checked the float level a few times as well, and to
&gt; the best of my measuring they are in spec. The bus runs fine otherwise
&gt; (though it is hard to start when hot, I assume from the leaking fuel).
&gt; Should I lower the float level, or is there something else I'm overlooking??
