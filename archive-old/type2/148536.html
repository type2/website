&gt;Well, I finally installed my new Dakota Digital CHT gauge and boy am I happy
&gt;that I now have some ideal how the engine is running  heat wise.   Well,
&gt;sort of at least the gauge works great, but Im not sure what readings I
&gt;should be expecting at different speeds and what temp reading would I wait
&gt;for to consider that the motor is warmed up.

I consider 300F to be warmed up. Simply idling the engine in the driveway it
may never get to that temperature and perhaps top off at 280F.

Once I'm driving around I find the temperature to be 300-310F at stop lights,
300-330F in the city and 340F-400F on the highway. As I attempt to go faster
than 65mph, the temps go over 400F and increase the faster I go. I chose to
set the annuciator on the DD gauge to 410-420F but that's only applicably for
my bus...

One thing I noticed recently is that the nominal idling CHT can vary from bus
to bus. For example the bus I tuned up for smog a week ago ran 30F hotter at
idle so naturally the other temperatures are 30F higher.
