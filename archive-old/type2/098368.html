&gt; Where did you see the racks?
&gt; According to his ad, he has no website.
&gt; If you click on 'New Bus Parts' up top, you get all the categories.
&gt; If you click on 'new bus parts', you find 4 things listed: no racks.

Karl,

Just in case you ever wondered why library science is a masters degree...
Searching is *not* easy! He does not have a site, he has an ad at
thesamba_dot_com. To save you the half hour I spend searching, the direct URL
for his ad is:

http://www.thesamba_dot_com/vw/classifieds/index.mv?photo+200206071833207977

I went to &quot;classifieds&quot; then to &quot;search&quot;, then specified &quot;rack&quot; in Find
Text and &quot;Type 2/Bus - 1968-up - Parts - For Sale&quot; in Sections and his ad
for &quot;vw BUS rOoF-RaCk,New!&quot; popped right up!  After only 20 minutes of
searching different options!  With his talent for use of the shift key, I
wonder if he does WaReZ as well?

The rack does look nice.  I'd want one if (a) I ever got another passenger
bus or (b) I did not already own one :-)

I would love to conduct my standard &quot;strength test&quot; on his racks, tho...
When I got mine, I did not have (and still don't have) a bus to put under
it (for some reason, I keep getting these Westies with the poptop), so I
leaned it against the fence with the legs sticking out and stacked ~500
lbs. of lumber, distributed, on the three sets of legs.  The VW rack held
it just fine.  Wonder how the repop would do? :-)
