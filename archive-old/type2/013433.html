Ok, I'm cleaning out, and have a bunch of stuff I'd
like to just make go away, but am loathe to actually
send to the recycler. If you want it, you can have it.
Here's the basics:

1. I won't ship it, you gotta come and get it. Don't
even ask. 
2. I have a bunch of sheet metal from a '72 bus that I
cut up for the parts. The only pieces not available
from that bus are the doors, the glass, the nose, the
cargo floor, the tranny, the motor, and some random
small pieces. The best available pieces are the roof
section and the front seat section. There are some
seats, too, just fronts. Also, an axle-beam, end to
end. 
3. I have a bunch of sheet metal and mechanicals from
a '67 Beetle, and almost all of this is available.
(again, no motor)
4. There are a few random pieces from a '69 Karmann
Ghia, including a decklid, hood, and other parts.
There are very few pieces from this car, that pretty
much covers it. 
5. There's a bunch of other oddballs, too, like a
Super Beetle decklid with fiberglass whale-tail, a
bunch of assorted stock wheels in varying condition,
and some NOS fenders for a Super Beetle. Don't know
that they're VW NOS, but they're NOS in primer. 
6. If you have some money, there's a '57 Karmann Ghia
in the driveway for $1,200. You can see pics of that
one at

Don't know that there is anything fantastic here, but
if you need it, you can't beat the price! If you want
any of it, e-mail me off-list at 

john_at_johncloonan_dot_com

If you don't pay attention, and post a reply to the
list, I may or may not get it.
