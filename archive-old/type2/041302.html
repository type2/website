&gt;OK new coil is in and condenser, plugs are fine, wires, points, cap, rotor
&gt;and she's still mis firing! AAAHHH. So I went through the wires puling them

&gt;change when three is pulled..... tried other wires just to make absolute
&gt;sure, but no luck in getting three to fire. So why wouldn't three be
&gt;firing??

First step is always a compression check.  If compression is low, check
valve lash.  If still low, it's time for major engine repairs.  If
compression is okay, it is spark or fuel related.  Spark - check everything
from the cap outward (cap, wire, plug).  Fuel - not much to check here -
possibly a vacuum leak where the manifold meets the head?
