Subject: Re: [T2] snow stories

shoot --- we did a four wheel drift on wet pavement at an intersection....

Man that Westy really leaned on that turn!!!! Entered the corner and gave 
it power. Bet we were close tot he limit - my friends thought we were PAST 
the limit.


&gt;back when I was younger and much more foolish I once bet someone I could
&gt;do a 4 wheel drift through a turn in my 60  23window deluxe....later I
&gt;learned some things about swing axles that turned my hair white...but I
&gt;did win a steak dinner and as a poor college student that was the best
&gt;meal I had in months.


Ciao!
