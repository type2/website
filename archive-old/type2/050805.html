Subject: [T2] Bus accident! vw bus hit by BIG yellow bus / want to buy 68-71 bus

Wanted 68-71 bus, to buy!

My friend was T-boned last week in his westy, by a BIG yellow school bus.
Luckily there were no children in the bus, and no one was hurt. The westy
was totaled however.

If anyone knows of a 68-71 bus *any type* for sale, please call or pmail me.
I am in the market to buy it this week.
