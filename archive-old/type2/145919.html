Subject: Autobraking (Brake pedal gets &quot;sucked&quot; down when I decellerate)

75' Long story.

Took it to a local shop(West Seattle) that was recommended to me by a
coworker because they offer a buyers inspection.  I wanted &quot;experienced&quot;
eyes to give the bus a once over and tell me what was wrong with it(incase
there was something I couldn't recognize or didn't already know about)

They claimed not to have done anything however my brakes were messed up. 
When I am under power things seem to be okay....when I hit the clutch and
decelerate....the brake pedal moves down....and I slow down.  When I hit
the brakes they work but the brake pedal stays down....they don't want to
come back up.

Garage claims that it was like that when I dropped it off....no sir. 
Couldn't have driven the 15 miles (hwy and street) like that if it was.  
Fine whatever...I am not going to argue...they just lost a customer thats
all.

So has anyone heard of this?   I thought I read something somewhere about
something similar but just searched my archives of the list and the list
archives on the site.
