Subject: Cylinder Head Cover Gasket Replacement

I am doing this for the first time tonight. I searched through the archives and
my Bentley manual and I am solid on the process. I just have one question. Will
using a small amount of grease between the cork gasket and the cover (enough to
just wet the cork) be sufficient to hold the gasket in place while putting the
cover on or should I look to another product to ensure proper fit. The grease I
have is the all-purpose Lithium based stuff.

Thanks,
