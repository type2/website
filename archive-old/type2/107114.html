Subject: Re: [T2] Fuel gauge calibration

On 4/19/03 9:43 PM, &quot;Jasan Carsley&quot; &lt;type2-78_at_attbi_dot_com&gt; wrote:

&gt; I just recently replaced my fuel gauge sender. Since then when I fill the tank
&gt; the needle on the gauge only goes to about three quarters full. With the old
&gt; sender the needle would go to full but then drop to empty at half full and no
&gt; longer register. Could this new sender be faulty or is there a way to
&gt; calibrate the fuel gauge? I know on the earlier bays there was a screw on the
&gt; back of the gauge to calibrate it. Can anyone confirm that this screw is on my
&gt; 78 before I have to take apart the instrument panel?

I think this screw you are talking about is on the fuel gauge vibrator and
should be the last thing you test.  Follow Jamie's procedure for testing the
system:

If the vibrator is at fault, I have a used one for you. New ones are $35.
