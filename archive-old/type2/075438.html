Subject: Re: [T2] setting valves on rebuild problem

On Fri, Bill Martin wrote (with very long lines):
&gt; so i went around to set the valves and in adjusting the number 3 
&gt; intake valve i noticed that no matter how much i backed off the
&gt; tappet it still didn't come free of the valve so i couldn't get
&gt; any lash 
&gt; i'm baffled... why would this be happening and does anyone have any suggestions for solving this problem?

how is the crank situated? i.e. could the cam be trying to actually push
the valve in question?. what effect does turning the crank have?
