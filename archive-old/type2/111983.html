&gt; &gt; Get behind a truck with both LEDs and conventional bulbs and you'll see
&gt; &gt; that the LED flash on instantly while the bulbs require a fraction of a
&gt; &gt; second to heat their filaments to incandesence.
&gt;
&gt; Wasn't it recently pointed out recently that the brake pedal has to travel
&gt; quite a bit before the switch on the master cylinder will activate? What you
&gt; are saying it that it's instant after this long delay...

Correct.  The bulb heating delay is not very long, but it is a significant
fraction of the reaction time and could be improved.

I've always thought that the brake light switch should be on the
throttle linkage.  Any time the throttle is up, the brake lights should be
on.  Another project...
