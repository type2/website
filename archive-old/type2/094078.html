Subject: I weighed my bus

FYI

I found an old registration document that said by Westy weighed 3,500lbs
with no driver or passengers.  I thought this was too high but then I
remembered how hard it was to push it across the parking lot last time the
battery was dead. 

I was curious what the front and rear axle weights were then I remembered
that the original bias ply tires were inflated to 30 front, 40 rear.  If
this was a sensible reflection of the weight distribution then the front
would weigh ~1500 lbs and the rear ~2000 lbs.

To confirm I looked under the Scales section of the yellow pages and went to
a metal recycling yard to weigh my bus.  I had to go last after all the
people with metal scraps but it was free.

The bus weighed in at 3500 lbs (w/two spare tires and me on board).

Front axle was 1640 lbs.
Rear axle was 1860 lbs.

Not to start another tire thread, but my rear tire is &quot;C&quot; load rated for
1433 lbs.  It's 6 ply but not reinforced in the sidewall.  Since it only has
to bear ~930 lbs it would seem a &quot;D&quot; rated is overkill but since the D tires
are usually 8 ply I understand why people choose them.

The age of my rear tires must factor greatly in their inability to handle
the bus in the crosswinds.

Seems the Continental CR21RF tires that Nemo found are the way to go.
