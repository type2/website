Subject: Re: [T2] Fuel control valve idea

Airod, an Austrailian company, makes solenoid valves and will ship you
one for ~$US30. For another $US30, they'll send you a controller that
monitors the engine pulse and the current to the ignition. When the
pulse stops, the valve closes. When the ignition is first turned to
run, a 3 second burst of fuel is allowed to pass through the valve (so
you can start you motor).
I haven't done the install yet. A little VR / ALT problem took up all
my available time since I received the goods. I'll be doing an install
in a few weeks, while replacing all of the fuel and vent lines. Seemed
like a good time to improve the fire safety. If I can get my hands on a
digital camera, I'll document it. The instructions that came with the
valve and controller look very simple.
Hope that helps. I know others have tried non-gasoline specific valves
and have had varying results. I looked into vacuum ones, but getting a
used one on &lt;auction site name here&gt; was close to $50, and didn't seem
as reliable and secure a solution. good luck--

&gt; As some folks might be aware I have been scratching my head about a
&gt; way to make the VW bus more resistant to gasoline fires. The obvious
&gt; method are keeping your fuel lines in good condition. 
&gt; 
&gt; My method was to add a normally closed electric solenoid valve to the
&gt; bottom of the tank to limit fuel flow to the engine and fuel pump in
&gt; case of fire or theft. In case of fire, simply turn the key off (or
&gt; flip a switch supplying power to the solenoid). Also the owner could
&gt; add a hidden switch which would keep the bus from starting (EFI
&gt; busses) or getting too far in case of theft (carb buses). 
&gt; 
&gt; These valves are really expensive from all the sources I found save
&gt; one (see the archives). A couple hundrd bucks but one source was $50.
&gt; I'm also somewhat wary of electric solenoid valves handling flammable
&gt; liquids even if they are rated for the job... &lt;grin&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; My new &quot;idea&quot;? A manual ball valve actuated by a vacuum solenoid as
&gt; used on the heating and cooling systems of late model (80's and 90's)
&gt; cars... Source: junkyard. 
&gt; 
&gt; Setup would keep the valve closed until there was a vacuum signal
&gt; (i.e. engine was running) and would close again once the engine
&gt; stopped (crash) or was shut off (fire).
&gt; 
&gt; Vaccum control valves: my '90 Hyundai (ugh) had the appropriate
&gt; valves. Junkyard trip!
