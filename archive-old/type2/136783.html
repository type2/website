Subject: Re: [T2] Re: Factory / Dealer Fog Lamps

The reason the fogs work with low beams only (as it is explained to me) is because of US lighting restrictions which dictate how much wattage a person can have burning at one time on a car. As the high beams are higher wattage, my source said the total output of the lighting was too high (high beams + driving lights). 

If my source is wrong please correct me!

My '97 VW Cabrio is the same way... I plan to bypass that feature and have the information to do it with simple jumper wires. No cut fix.
