Subject: Friday sightings
Mime-Version: 1.0

Two sightings - first, in the current issue of &quot;Budget Travel&quot; magazine, 
there is an article by a guy who walked out of his job one day and drove to 
Canada in his VW bus.  Interesting because the picture in the article is of 
a non-US model bus (late bay with small pop top and Austrailian (?) plates).

Second was the movie &quot;Gone in 60 seconds&quot;.  The original one, not the new 
Nicholas Cage one which was just stupid, I thought.  I bought the DVD of 
the original movie just for the car chase scene, which is rather famous in 
certain circles.  This movie was shot in the seventies not far from where I 
grew up in the Long Beach, CA area.  Because of the era and location, there 
were busses everywhere!  I lost count when I got to about ten.  Loafs, 
splitties, most very nice condition of course because they were nearly 
new.  The movie is decidedly low budget, but it's a neat snapshot of a time 
that I still remember vividly, and it was fun listening to the police 
dispatcher say the names of all the streets I used to ride my bike on when 
I was growing up.  :)
