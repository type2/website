        Generally speaking, a new engine needs a break-in period,
usually stated as 500-1000 miles, never driving over 50mph. And likewise
not revving the engine past whatever your engine speed is at 50 in top
gear.
Most engine rebuilders (and most new car warrantees) usually state this,
or at least they used to. Haven't had one of either in a long time, so
possibly with new materials, things have changed, but I rather doubt it.
