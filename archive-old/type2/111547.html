Subject: installing an O2 sensor and A/F meter

I have a A/F meter and Standard 1 wire Bosch O2 sensor that I am going to install.  First though I need to weld a bung in.  What Size threads or an O2 sensor?  It looks like typical spark plug threads.  those are 14 mm?   Do I have to use a special weld-on or can I weld a nut that is the right size?
 
Thanks Paul.
