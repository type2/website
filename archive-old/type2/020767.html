&gt; Hello,
&gt;
&gt;  I'm new to this list. We live in Seattle.
&gt;  I stopped by a local VW parts supplier today and asked what a rebuilt 78
&gt; van engine with new heads would cost me. He said  $2200.
&gt;   This left me wondering why the $1000 difference between that and the
&gt; prices I see for rebuilt 2 liters on the web and in the magazines .
&gt;    I asked him about this and he claimed that the cheaper shops use &quot;junk
&gt; parts that the Seattle rebuilders would not use.
&gt;    So I'm asking you: what kind of luck have you folks had with the &quot;mail
&gt; order&quot; rebuild shops?

Neil:
That's not quite the right answer. I'm not sure where I could even find JUNK
grade parts for a type 4 engine, unless they were used. Well, maybe Brazilian
bearings and rings, even then they are not that bad. The real reason is the
other 7/8 of the job. It should be time, as in labor in cleaning and
reconditiong the parts, replacing the cam/ lifters, finding better cores, if
an exchange, etc. (I'm saying that there might be $125 difference in parts
bills between the best parts and cheaper parts that might be available.)
There is a LOT of difference available in skill level between the best and the
worst, and I'm not sure I'd trust this guy.
I think you need to find someone with good credentials (which, of course, is
what you asked) or second best, get an AVP or Boston Bob motor. Of course,
that changes the dynamics of the transaction, and you might have to ask the
vendor for names of a local shop that would just install an engine.
