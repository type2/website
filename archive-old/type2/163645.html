Subject: Re: [T2] disc brake pads

I second the PBRs - so far they have been awesome.

Granted - when i installed them - i had put rebuilt calipers, new flex
hoses, and had resurfaced my rotors - but overall performance is good no nod
dust or squeaking.

&gt; &gt;anyone have any preferences on a brand of brake pad?  this is for a 77

&gt; &gt;body.
&gt;
&gt; The OE pads (Pagid, Jurid, etc) are fair priced and work well but they
&gt; produce a lot of brake dust. Not a big deal if you wash your wheels
&gt; regularly (which you should do because the front wheels like to corrode
more
&gt; than the rears).
&gt;
&gt; I believe the cause of the dust is because those pads are made in Europe
&gt; to TUV regs. requiring the manufactures to include a certain percentage of
&gt; graphite during manufacture. I'm not 100% sure but I believe this is too
&gt; limit the amount of heat transfer from the pad to the caliper where the
&gt; brake fluid could boil.
&gt;
&gt; PBR is a popular alternative I see sold everywhere.
