Subject: Re: Battery tray replacement

I replaced both mine with a custom cut piece (used a cardboard template)
dropped right in on top of the flange from the cut away old.  Rust-proofed
the dickens out of it all and epoxied the new it.  Lots of good paint inside
and out and a new battery &quot;seat&quot; to bolt the battery down (that's half the
battle, just don't let it rock around), and it's still working fine.  I'd
like to learn the welding gig someday, too, but in the meantime...

&gt;eaten through but the sides look ok so far.I was wondering how evrybody
else
&gt;took care of it.Who sells the cheapest but good quality battery tray tin?Do
I
&gt;need to pull motor or can I work around?How do I go about it?I have a buddy
&gt;with Mig welder-plasma cutter and all that stuff, will I warp the quarter
&gt;panel of my bus or will the paint bubble.Let me know, you can email me
direct
&gt;if you got some advice for me, I like to do the job right.
