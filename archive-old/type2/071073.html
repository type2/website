I know that VW hasn't had these available in several years, but I just came
across a special stash from South Africa!

Genuine VW &quot;GEOTHERMAL PLUNKITY VALVES&quot; for only $595.00

You've already read on the list that none of the FLAPS carry these, so this
may be the only source available!

Now every water boxer Vanagon has one, and they go bad all the time, so now's
the time to stock up on one or two, cuz you never know when you will need one.

Got an old air cooler Vanagon?  No problem, I also sell the conversion kit so
you can upgrade and install the &quot;GEOTHERMAL PLUNKITY VALVES&quot;, only $1,295.00
including the bell housing, rear hangers and starter.

Got an old &quot;GEOTHERMAL PLUNKITY VALVE&quot; and want more power?  I have the
special chip upgrade for a mere $7K more.

p-mail for details.
