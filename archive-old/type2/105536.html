&gt; What years are your buses....I picked up 4x8 plywood before I started 
&gt; working on my bus last year and it was *not* a tight fit at all...at least 
&gt; an inch or so on each side cause I measured it before i went.

with some of the kids they hire at these local big box lumber yards a foot
on either side is a tight fit.  I am always on one end, but still can't
handle a full sheet of 3/4 inch plywood alone
