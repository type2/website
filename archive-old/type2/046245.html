Subject: [T2] Building a 1776cc, any tips?

I'm going to rebuild my 1600dp as a 1776cc with a warm cam (Engle 110),
stock heads. I intend to fit twin Kadrons &amp; a 'Empi Monza' 4 tip exhaust
that I got _at_ vanfest last week. I would VERY much like to get an CIS FI
system set up from a Golf (rabbit) etc....

Any tips on building this type of engine would be great, I only want to do
this once! Advice on components etc is cool too!
