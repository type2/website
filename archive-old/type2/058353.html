Subject: Cylinder shims, gaskets; Whats the scoop?

I recently did a compression check on &quot;the green bean&quot; (77 2 litre)  and
found that the right bank had gone south since I checked it last month.
Checked the valve adjustments and found I couldn't set #1 exhaust valve
correctly.  Popped the rocker arms off and found that # 1 exhaust valve
stem had mushroomed.  This surprised me as I had had this head rebuilt last
year.

I pulled the engine and pulled just this right head and sent it off to the
machine shop for another go.  Got it back today and I have a query before I
reinstall it.  The rebuilder had to fly cut it .030&quot;.  I don't really want
to pull the other head and do a complete compression ratio balance.  I'm
only going to use &quot;the green bean&quot; two more months before I put it away for
a winters nap.  I am also planning to build a complete new replacement
engine from spares I have this winter.

Should I reinstall it with a set of .050&quot; head to cylinder gaskets that I
have instead of the normal .035&quot; gaskets.  In researching the archive,
Bentley and Haynes on this I find a lot of conflicting information.

Are cylinder to head gaskets still used?

Should I order a set of .030&quot; cylinder to case shims instead and just put
them on this bank?


What's the scoop?

Thanks,

Steve Blackham
