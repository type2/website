&gt; I've been running the specified Bosch Copper plugs and I'm content with

&gt; Any body try a few bumps up on hotter plugs and get better mileage,
&gt; performance etc.?

I bumped my 2l FI 78 up a notch to the next level hotter plugs for a year
or two, didn't notice any difference so I just run the regular spec plugs
