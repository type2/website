Subject: Save the VWs! &amp; &quot;Flame bait&quot; results =)

The effects of scene police that keep the scene pure have
always seemed worse to me than any evil they seek to prevent. I agree
there's a problem as you describe, but I don't like the obvious
'solutions'- what are you suggesting besides awareness?

VanBondo sez:
Over all I only suggest awareness. I don't mean to get &quot;totally serious and
such.&quot; Each to their own. Me to mine. All things get old and become fewer
and more fragile with age. If I paid more attention in Sunday school I would
have memorized verbatim the Biblical quote regarding &quot;This too shall turn to
rust.&quot; Earth to earth, dust to dust, blah blah, etc. The point is this is
all temporary and when it gets down to it, I perceive VWs as a means of
having fun and adding quality to my life. They are only an aspect of my
life, not the center of it.
Please realize that I like to &quot;shake the bag&quot; occasionally to create a
(hopefully) intersting and healthy discussion. I have received plenty of
support for both fundamental sides of the issue with a lot of variation in
between. I/we should not and will not be able to dictate who sells what to
whom and at what price. Thank goodness! I certainly would object to anyone
telling me what I can and can not do. I also have bought and sold many
vehicles (and parts) at the lower local and email level in order to support
my VW habit. Alot of us have. In doing so I have met a lot of nice folks.
The core of my posture is to enjoy and preserve the quirky little ****s as
long as I can locate, maintain and afford them. Hopefully I will be passing
the vehicle along to an appreciative new owner, (in a little improved
condition than when I bought it) who will keep and actually use the thing
for what it was intended instead of just a shiny doorstop. I hope to gain
enjoyment and service out of them while I own them. For me they beat the
heck out of paying through the &quot;ears&quot; for a newer ride. I hope to break even
or (GASP!, Is he really going to say it????) even turn a buck on them when I
am done with them. No one in their right mind would want to loose on them. 
I might completely disagree with what someone else has to say but I will
fight like mad to defend their right to express their point of view. I hope
that you all would do the same for me. Too many chores to do...
Now, I gotta go &quot;get a life&quot;...
The point is to have fun kids!
