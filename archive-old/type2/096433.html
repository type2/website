Subject: Re: [T2] clutch alignment

Tyler,

You might get lucky(by eye) and might not.

Find a socket in your set that &quot;just&quot; fits inside the splines on the 
clutch disk.  Test fit it up against the flywheel for &quot;close&quot; fit
as well where the pilot bearing is.

Put your long extension on it and align the disk that way.  Do a test
fit without the pressure plate so you know what it feels like and then 
look around the edges to see if they are even inside the inner ring 
in the flywheel.

When the distance is even around the edges, you know it is right.

It's difficult to explain, but will work.  My sears 13mm socket is a 
perfect outside match for the internal splined area on the clutch disk.

Used this method for years before I got a &quot;real&quot; trans shaft to use.

Cheers, dave
