Subject: Re: Trailer hitch?

george:
does your hitch have problems with the u-bolts
loosening and sliding on the axle beam ?

the bracket attaches to the bumper of the towed vehicle ?
do you drill holes for that ? is this part two brackets, ?
does the tow bar have a pivot mechanism ?

the 3/4 stock which makes up the structural part- is it solid or hollow ?

would you tow at highway speeds with this towbar ?
