Subject: Re: [T2] t4 duals on t1

Clark:
similar carbs were used on the 1500s type 3's in 1967 and also Brazilian type1
engined vehicles up till the late 80s.
Kadrons (Brazilian Solex 40's )might be the simplest to find parts and linkage
for and also simplest to fettle. ( and you WILL need to fettle.)
This is terra incognita for most of us.

&gt; List,
&gt; Provided i can get the manifolds/adapters, will a set of dual carbs off a 73
&gt; type4 1700 breathe well on a type1 engine? The T1 will be an 1835cc w/ stock
&gt; DP heads.
&gt; The 1700 carbs are stock, but i don't know which ones they are.
&gt;
&gt; What about the manifolds? Anyone done this?
