Subject: Re: Perfect Heater for Bus

I have the pefect heater for my bus. It's called MYWIFE. If we go camping, 
and it's at all cold, she's all over me like a cheap suit, scavanging heat. 
[Not that I mind, no fool I ]  She has an automatic heat sensor, which causes 
her to roll away if it gets too hot, come in closer when it gets cold. And an 
air freshener component...what is it about womens shampoo??? Drives us guys 
nuts...
