Subject: Where dit' go???

I hope this isn't too redundant but, what happened to the online archive? As a
list subscriber, I get all of the current digests but haven't got an application
on my Mac that can read them. I therefore read the list online and look at
titles that seem of interest to me without having to go through every posting to
get to one I need. I really feel lost not having access. Please p-mail me with
the answer. Thanks,
