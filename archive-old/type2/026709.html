Subject: Manual Trans Fluid - flush?
Date: Thu, 21 Jun 2001 08:58:07 -0400
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

I saw the recommendation for Amsoil synthetic gear oil for manual tranny
fluid and will probably go that way too.
Question: I just drained the oil out of my '73 (acquired last year, so have
no idea how often, if at all, this oil was ever changed) and it was very
dirty.  Before filling it up with Amsoil and putting it back in the vehicle
(it's out at this time), should I flush it with something to get the crud
out?  If so, what should I use to flush?
