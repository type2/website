Subject: Re: No pump-a fuel

&gt;I'll bet on the push rod, it's my understanding that the shorter push rod is 
&gt;for fuel pumps that fit under alternators.
&gt;
&gt;c. David Gibson

I went out and looked at the box the fuel pump came in.  On the sticker with 
the english description and UPC code it said &quot;pushrod 107.5mm.&quot;  

I measured the pushrod I took out -- 107.5mm.  The one I put in was 99mm.   

That was it.  I figured that with this new fuel pump with the slanted 
geometry (to accommodate the larger diameter alternator -- which I installed 
a few years back), I needed a different length pushrod.  Nope.

So Lurch is ready to load up with toys for all the good little girls and boys.
