We recently noticed that our 1978 Bus (pop top, chassis no. 2382074081, 2
litre engine CJ109108, Westfalia interior SO 73/7) has a novel feature - the
headlights come on as well as the brake lights when we apply the brakes.
I've been driving with the headlights on permanently so that people don't
think I am signalling to them all the time. Any ideas what I should look for
when I go to fix it?

Secondly, is there any way I can tell if I have hydraulic valves without
opening up the engine? I've read that they were introduced in the 1978
models but don't know if my bus has the original engine.

And finally, the electric heater fan in the engine compartment has blown a
fuse twice. Does anyone have any experience where wires commonly rub bare
and short?

Although I have a Haynes Manual and the John Muir books I'm new to this and
any advice would be much appreciated.

Thanks,
