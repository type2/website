Subject: Camping Stool Needed - pics

Hey there volks,

Karl had mentioned the yellow plastic trash can that came with the
storage box/camping stool. I had never seen one of these, so he sent
me some pictures of the trash can.

I thought it would be nice to post the pictures, (Karl gave me
permission to put them on my page), so that if anyone else wants to
see what the trash can looks like go to:

As they say, a picture is worth a thousand words.
