Cham...

While you are right on in your description of the smog pump, let me clarify.  I do not 
wish to trash smog pumps or hold a smog tech lecture.  Fact is, they work.  The engine 
power loss is low in a properly running engine.

My point is that my Bus and Mustang and your Bus and Z car would be taken off the road 
if the powers that currently be had their way.

My Mustang can be retired to track-only duty but I don't really want to lose my Bus.

I'll do my part.  That's all I ask of you.

Todd
