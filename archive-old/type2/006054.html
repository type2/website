Another way we do oil temp on engines with external oil systems, is to tap
the filter mount, directly in the flow of oil, our full flow type 4 engines
have the sensor there, and it works absolutely great, as heat from the case
is nil. I had 3 oil temp senders on the 2613 in the beetle, one in the sump,
one in the filter housing and one after the last of 3 oil coolers, before
entering the case. The variations were about 100 degrees on some occasions,
especially after crusing at near 90 for over an hour or so..

&gt; The sump sender is the best. I have done back to back DYNO testing with
both
&gt; types on the same engine, and had a 25 Degree fluctuation in readings. The
&gt; dipstick sender is heated by the case, as it slides into the dipstick
tube.
&gt; In our test I used 2 used, and one brand new sender in the sump location
and
&gt; 3 new dipstick styles. They aere all the same.
&gt;
&gt; I then placed the 2 in a pot of boiling water, to do the old fashioned
test.
&gt; Unbelieveably the dipstick sender was within 5 degrees of the sump style
&gt; sender, until the edge of the sender made contact with the pot, which
&gt; changed the temp 30 degrees.
&gt;
&gt; We make a sender for the sump area on our large engines that incorporates
an
&gt; actuation switch for the oil cooler fan, we use a rabbit coolant sensor to
&gt; do the job, and place the oil temp sender  adjacent to it, it works
great..

&gt; &gt; David:
&gt; &gt; Just the fact that (cost be damned!) Porsche would use this piece is
&gt; pretty good
&gt; &gt; evidence that it is up to par, performance wise. (Incidentally, it's
used
&gt; in
&gt; &gt; 912E's as well- a hp 2 liter VW engine used in 911 chassis in 1976 only)

&gt; &gt; &gt; The VDO sump plate sender used in the Porsche 914 measures the
&gt; temperature
&gt; &gt; &gt; from exactly the same spot as a dipstick sender.  I've provided proof
of
&gt; &gt; &gt; this in the past and yet some people still seem to think that this
sump
&gt; &gt; &gt; sender is somehow inferior to a dipstick sender.
