Hi volks,

&gt; While many of our Euopean listees are concerned about whether dual carbs
&gt; will bankrupt them, I would like to say that I saw fuel advertised at
&gt; $.869/ gallon on Wednesday. I think fuel is 4 to 5 times that in Europe,

 I filled up last night at 69.9 pence per litre, which is US$4.37 per US gallon: almost exactly five times the $.869 you quote. Unleaded is a bit cheaper, though.

&gt; While on this thread, does anyone have readily available the conversions
&gt; to price per gallon and miles per gallon for Britain and Germany

 I always thought that a US gallon was 16 fluid ounces and an imperial gallon 20 but the UNIX units program quotes an imperial gallon as 4.55 litres and a US gallon as 3.79 suggesting that your fluid ounces are a different size as well...which leaves me too confused to try and work out the factors...

Cheers,
              W.
