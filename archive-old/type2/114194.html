Subject: Re: [T2] engine cleaning??

Zach,
My personal preference is to spray down all the electrical stuff with
WD-40, or LPS first--then spray the engine down with diesel fuel--let it
soak for 20--30 minutes, and then pressure wash it down---
All the crud will fly off pretty easy.
This formula has worked well for me for many years.

Zep Formula 50 also works real good on oil and grease, but is a bit more
costly than fuel oil .

Have Fun---

Terry

 
E-mail message   
 
could someone tell me what if anything special I need to do if I want to
clean my engine. I just fixed an oil leak(s) and the bottom is sort of
gross and I would like to clean it up. Should I just spray her off at
the car wash? What about inside the engine compartment? Does anything
need to be covered? 
Thanks
