Subject: Re: [T2]age old question(OIL)

AS you guys know, I'm all about the tire and oil
FARTS.  However, I still don't have this worked
out in my head.  If 10W30, 5W30, or 0W30 act the
same as SAE30 at operating temp--which of course
is almost all the time you have your engine
running-- why is there a rush to lower viscosity
base oil in the name of fuel economy? If it is
the same viscosity at operating temp, how does it
provide better fuel economy?  

Happy bussin'
