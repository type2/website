Subject: I have Ambulance fans to trade

Hello list! I sent this email out yesterday but for got to add a few things.
I have a set of ambulance fans for trade. they have the gaskets and covers
and are in excellent condition. I got them out of a 69 westy and planned on
putting them in my 68 4 door crewcab (yes 4 doors). Though I would still
like to put them there. I would prefer to trade these for a middle seat for
my 63  23 window. Can anyone help me out???

I am in Tacoma WA
