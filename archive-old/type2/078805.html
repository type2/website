&gt; Unfortunately, I must offer DILLIGAD for sale...
&gt;
&gt; *snif*
&gt;
&gt; The specs: 1974 Westfalia camper (white)
&gt; 87k original miles.
&gt; This beauty was stored indoors for ten years...it's spent the last few
years
&gt; outside, but the cancer is just starting and still reversable - this is a
&gt; good candidate for restoration.
&gt; No pop-top, but a solid roof with roof rack.
&gt; Engine is dead, due to my ineptitude at re-builds...BUT this offer
includes
&gt; three (3) engines, which I'm sure in the hands of a capable mechanic could
be
&gt; combined into one working engine.
&gt; BRAND new tires - less than 200 miles on them.
&gt; BRAND new clutch - less than 1000 miles on it.
&gt; Four extra wheels.
&gt;
&gt; Also included: spare glass all around (from a parts bus I had) windshield,
&gt; back window, side windows etc.
&gt;
&gt; Pics will be posted soon - watch this space for details.
&gt;
&gt; No reasonable offer will be refused...reply to snave515_at_aol_dot_com
&gt;
&gt; *snif*
&gt;
&gt; I really REALLY wish I didn't have to sell her, but circumstances require
it.
&gt; Please help me find her a good home.
&gt;
