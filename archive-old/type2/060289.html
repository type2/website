Subject: RE: vw theft prevention

&gt; &gt; Would you rather flip a hidden switch under the dash or mess around in a
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; dirty engine compartment?
&gt; 
&gt; I agree that a kill switch is easier, but I'm told (and its easy to
&gt; believe) that auto-thieves know about kill switches and can find them
&gt; quickly.  
	[...]  
	A friend once had a set of real cheap headphones hanging on this
lighter, and
	a jack in the dash above his stereo. The headphones were fake, with
a short in 
	the plug, which was his kill switch. His car would not start unless
the headphones
	were plugged in;-)
