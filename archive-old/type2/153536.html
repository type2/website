Subject: RE: [T2] VW Type2 on XBox 360

I believe the new game for Disney Cars has Fillmore (The Splitty) in it.  I
have only the PS2 and don't own the game personally so I can't speak for it.

http://reviews.teamxbox_dot_com/xbox/1182/Cars/p1/

This is listed under xBox, not xBox 360 specifically.  Not sure if it's
backwards compatible or not.

Peace...

OK.  I am not a gamer but after my wife and kids for years have been
harassing me to get a game console, I finally broke down.  My wife is
getting an Xbox 360 for her birthday this week.

Now comes the real question...  Are there any good games out there with
VWs (especially VW Type2s and Type1s)?
