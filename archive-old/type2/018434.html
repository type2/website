&gt; Am I the only brain surgeon out there who has stripped the nut on the main

&gt; think there's enough room to get in there with a Dremel &amp; I'm not sure
&gt; there's enough slack on the wires to pull the starter with them attached.
&gt; Can I pull the starter out enough to maneuver with all the wires
&gt; connected???

You can disconnect the battery cable (you already did that right?)  and feed the
cable through the firewall and towards the starter.  Pull the wire from the
ignition switch that connects to the solonoid.  You may have some difficulties
with the wire that is also connected to the started providing the +12V elsewhere
if you cannot get enough slack.  If you have that problem, the wire (small) can
always be cut right at the terminal, remove the starter and then crimp on a new
terminal when you are done.

This should be easier than trying to dremel the nut off of it while up and
attached to the tranny.


There are two bolts holding the starter, one on top, one on the bottom.  The top
one is a long bolt that holds the engine to the bell housing.

&gt;
&gt;
&gt; While I'm down there, I have another question.  There's a red/yellow wire
&gt; (small gauge) that looks like it should connect to the solenoid, but it
&gt; doesn't show up on the wiring diagram.  Could this go to my Eberspacher
&gt;

It could, but it would connect in parallel with the battery cable, not on one of
the solonoid control terminals.
