Subject: knock when warm only

I am sorry to tell you, that it is pretty common for a rod knock to appear only after
warmup.
The thick oil hides the presence of the huge bearing gap. The oil gets hot, the oil gets
thin, the parts starts banging into each other, you hear the noise.

Before you do a teardown, have a good experienced mechanic listen to it. A rod knock is
very easy to diagnose to the experienced ear.

You should not run the engine. A knock can get worse and ruin expensive parts.
