&gt; Oh mighty list advisers,
&gt; 
&gt; I was just about ready to travel to Flagstaff Arizona to look/buy a 71
&gt; transporter w/converted westy interior. The owner sent me some fair looking
&gt; pics, said it was in perfect original condition, and wanted me to deposit
&gt; $4,500 into his bank account *first* and then go to Flagstaff and look/buy
&gt; it.

I hear Hell looks great during the snow season...

&gt; Okay, I said I would fly out from San Diego * at my own expense* take a look
&gt; at it and then make my decision to buy it or not.
&gt; 
&gt; He just called me back, said he wanted to be sure he made a full disclosure
&gt; * since he is a lawyer * of everything before I traveled the over 500 miles
&gt; to buy it.  This was very nice of him.....

I guess since lawyers sue at the drop of a hat, the expect the same of
everyone, particularly someone who has just blown lots of $$$ to see a
rustbucket.

&gt; Now he proceeds to tell me about a few things that are not right with this
&gt; perfect condition original  bus. Like as in BTW, 1.  The gas gauge doesn't
&gt; work  *dealer said it was  the sending unit in the tank*... On a 71 wouldn't
&gt; that entail pulling the engine and the tank in order to repair it? Hmm.

No, the factory fix is to cut a hole in the sheetmetal and to fabricate
the cut-out piece into a door afterward.

&gt; 2. The front seats *under the sheepskins* are shot. 3.  The rear cushion
over
&gt; the engine compartment has holes in it where the sun has hit it.  

Upholstery is relatively easy to deal with.

&gt; 4.  The
&gt; kick panels in the front cab are shot

Easily replaced.

&gt;  5.  The water pump for the sink
&gt; doesn't work. 

Available from RV stores.  Not too expensive.

6. Apparently a mechanic at the dealer, pulled the heat/fresh
&gt; air knobs out and didn't put them back in right *who knows what that looks
&gt; like*.. 

He probably forgot the spring shims that keep the levers from rattling.

7.  The front skin as well as the roof was repainted and doesn't
&gt; match the rest of the bus.

I wonder how much Bondo lurks under that new paint?

 8.  All or most of the plastic edges on the
&gt; cabinets are cracked or broken. 

To be expected on a 30-year-old vehicle.

9.  Had a fire in the engine compartment
&gt; near the battery, it was repaired but not repainted.

Rust city!

&gt; No truer statement has ever been said: Buyer Beware
&gt; 
&gt; I am looking again!!! If anyone has a very clean 71 transporter/or, camper
&gt; bus, they would like to sell, pmail me I have a buyer for it....

There was a nice '70 nineseater at BBBV.  Guy wanted $3800 for it.  Pretty
paint, great interior.  I might have espied a hint of bondo on the nose,
though.
