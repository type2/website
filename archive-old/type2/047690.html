Subject: [T2] Re: [VB] Coleman Catalytic heaters for in the bus

[...]

How about rigging a small 12V fan/blower in a window opening, with another
window or vent also open, to provide a low volume forced cross-flow
ventilation?

A while back I had a flier for some solar-powered ventilation fans that fit
into door windows and were retained by the rolled up glass.  The openings
were hooded to exclude precipitation.  Something like this, but battery
powered and adapted to the bus's windows, ought to provide an adequate
exchange of fresh air to preclude carbon monoxide and/or oxygen depletion
hazards/problems.

Low oxygen and carbon monoxide alarms/detectors would still be a very good
idea for backup protection.

FWIW.....

&lt;&lt; Here is a link to the heaters that were discussed earlier in the week. &gt;&gt;

&gt;  Just make sure to only use it with at least a window open or better yet
with at least two battery powered low oxygen alarms (Kind of like a smoke
alarm)!
