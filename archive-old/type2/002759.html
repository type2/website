Hey all-
My next project is to get the bumper on.
Missing the Drivers Side and I believe the 72 is different from all
the rest is it not?

So if you have one you would be willing to part with...
Drop me a line


Next I'll be rebuilding the stock carbs and looking for oil leaks.

(Last week I missed out on a rebuilt set of carbs and an oil bath air
cleaner for a '72 on ebay, looked good but a guy named Mr. Westy beat
me in the closing minutes) - still bummed about that.

Thanks again for the help on the dipstick measurements, and Big Thanks
to Nikki for the '73 Air Box


Thanks!
