Is the trans the same gear ratio?

Since no one else answered your questions I'll give them a shot.  The
transmission changed in 1972 with the new 1700 engine and again in 1974 with
the new 1800 engine. I have always understood the gears became progressively
taller with each new transmission. I know Rocky Mountain Motorworks lists a
different transmission and part number for each engine.
 
In the engine compartment there is a bracket that is attached to the right
fender well near the gas tank. Its 1in wide and about 3-4in long 
with two holes in it. What was mounted here?

You didn't specifiy whether you are asking about the '70 or '74 bus, but I
suspect it would be the voltage regulator mount in the '70 bus or an
emissions canister for the '74 model.  I understand the canister was vented
from the fuel filler neck and designed to trap and absorb fuel vapors that
would otherwise escape.  The canister is about 1 liter in size. I have seen
them attached in various areas around the right side of the engine
compartment.  If you have a outlet on the fuel filler neck that is plugged
or blocked off I would venture to guess the canister has been removed and
the vent tube plugged.

Sorry I couldn't help with the other questions and I may not even be correct
about these two. 
Take care.
