Subject: Attaching script/emblems

Hello all!

I've never had a bus with a front emblem on it before,
but I got a new chrome one for christmas, so I guess
that's all going to change.

I got the little mounting clips for it, but I have a
couple of guestions.  Do the clips slide into the nose
on the bus from the outside, followed by the studs on
the emblem snapping into them.  If so, is there any
way to ensure that some kid can't snag my beautiful
new emblem for the purpose of creating a stylish,
though slightly oversized, new necklace?

The volkswagen script on the back of the bus was
removed by some dealership at one point in order to
place their own tin badge in it's place.  The holes
for the original script are still there, and I also
have purchased a new script for it.  Can't find any
kind of mounting hardware for this part, any ideas?
