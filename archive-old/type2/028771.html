&gt; I am very displeased with the Bus Depot's slow service.  I placed an order
&gt; a week and a half ago for a bunch of parts (mostly sheet metal) for my '73
&gt; Westy. After not hearing anything for about a week, I called them and was
&gt; told that I might see my stuff by the end of next week.

To repeat what I state in EVERY part of my advertising - website, catalog,
etc. - please allow 7-10 working days for delivery. You cannot look up my
parts, prices, or order number anywhere that does not also specify that
timeframe.  If you get your order at the end of next week, it will have been
almost exactly that timeframe.

We do not always take the full 7-10. Usually we take less time. Sometimes
more. (Sometimes a lot more, if a part is backordered and there is only one
supplier.  Unfortunately this is all too commonplace with old VW parts, like
it or not.)

Expedited service (even overnight) is almost always available.  If you have
a deadline, you are best off taking advantage of that feature.  If you are
in an absolute rush and cannot afford to take any chances at all, go to the
local VW dealer or FLAPS where you can walk out with the part in-hand; that
way you won't even have to risk UPS delaying your part.

You ordered on the 1-800 order line. This line is manned by an operator who
is qualified to do absolutely nothing but take your order by part number.
She has no say as to when your order will ship. She indeed took your order
exactly as you placed it - via standard delivery. This means approximately
7-10 working days.  If you needed it sooner, all you had to do was order
expedited delivery.

&gt; I dialed their toll-free number, and then had to call back on their
customer service # on my dime.

That is correct.  The operators who answer my toll-free number can do
absolutely NOTHING but take orders by part number.  They cannot look up
existing orders, provide part numbers or info, or promise any delivery
timeframe other than what is in our catalog/website. This is a &quot;self
service&quot; order number was set up for the convenience of my customers who do
the legwork themselves and know EXACTLY what they need. If you need anything
beyond that whatsoever, you do indeed have to call the toll number.  This,
too, is explicitly stated in every single ad I run.  If you try to ask the
operator questions about your order, you will not get an experienced answer.
It's like asking the receptionist at a doctor's office to diagnose your
illness.

I've said this before on the list, and I'll say it again.  I am a price
oriented vendor. II give you the best possible prices on the best possible
quality. That is what I do well.  You don't get Bloomingdales service at
Sams Club.  Similarly, you will not get VW Dealer service from The Bus
Depot.  But you will get comparable quality for a much cheaper price.  In
fact, as a rule you will pay less than pretty much any vendor out there,
&quot;apples for apples.&quot;

I had a customer on the phone today who griped that he had to pay for the
toll call to find out where his order was.  (It arrived today, on the 9th
business day.)  I asked him how much he was paying for the call; he said a
few dollars.  I asked him how much he saved on the parts compared to the
next cheapest vendor he'd found.  He paused, admitted that he had saved
about thirty dollars, and stopped complaining about the couple of bucks he'd
paid for the call.  Incidentally, he could have gotten the part via
overnight air, and even after paying for overnight shipping still saved $15
compared to the next cheapest vendor.


During the last 2 weeks, all h*ll has broken loose at The Bus Depot. We
installed new, expensive software which, after 6 months in development and
testing, spent the first week crashing our computers about once an hour all
day long. It has been an absolute nightmare.  The result is that we are very
definately at the top end of the 7-10 working day delivery range right now.
I am doing my best to remedy this.  We are upgrading some orders to
3-day-air and Priority Mail at no additional charge. We are reducing
shipping charges on some orders by way of compensation, and offering some
people partial shipping credits toward their next order. I even brought in a
couple of temps to help out, at an hourly rate that makes me shudder.

The good news is, it looks like the bugs are finally worked out. This means
that once we catch up again (in about a week) we will have big improvements.
We will be able to process orders much faster, which should decrease both
delivery times and the amount of time you spend on hold when you call.  We
will finally be able to partially charge an order, meaning that backordered
items will not be charged until they ship (a change which is long overdue
but was not supported by our old software).  Website orders will directly
download to our shop rather than being processed offsite first, which will
increase response time and decrease error potential.  The website product
database will also update automatically, about once a week.  All in all, it
will make for much better customer service from now on. But it did hurt us
during this two week transition period.

If you have not received your order within the 7-10 working day timeframe,
please do email or call Customer Service and we'll do everything we can to
remedy the situation.
