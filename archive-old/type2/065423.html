To All:

I had a jackstand fail on me.  Metal fatigue.  Dropped a pickup truck sorta
on my arm.  I've since gotten into the habit of putting blocks under the
wheels and kicking a couple of spare tires (with wheels) under the edge of
the vehicle, figuring it will give me a little breathing room in case I'm
having a really bad day.  I get kidded about it now and then but I'm a
confirmed evolutionary and don't bother to explain.
