&gt; The green movement has done more harm to the environment than all of  the
&gt; nuclear reactors in history.  By orders of magnitude...

&gt;  ANWAR, Gulf of Mexico, my backyard, wherever.   Hey, I need to go set up
&gt; my drill.  I'm feelin' lucky!   Cheers...KR

It's not the reactor, per se, that's the problem...It's the nuclear waste...
Are you ( not personally &quot;you&quot;, the collective &quot;you&quot; ) willing to have the
waste in your backyard...?-)

Exxon also spends   &quot;a lot of money&quot; financing studies to refute &quot;global
warming&quot; (as well as lobbying to retain their &quot;oil depletion allowances&quot;)
Also, Exxon spends the least of the big oil co's on alternative sources...
And in terms of profits, I'd like to see what the &quot;actual&quot; cost of oil/gas
in this country is...? Including subsidies, and the cost of US military/
foreign aid/ etc. to protect the Mideast sources of oil.
Sadly, oil has become more (a quick overview of the history of the
Mideast since the beginning of the 20th C. will bear me out) of an
economic weapon than merely a commodity...;-(
