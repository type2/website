Hi Jason,

Much as I would LOVE to bring a keg to EB, I am loathe to push my  
luck importing 25 gallons of Quality Home-Brew into the US without  
paperwork. The border patrol already considers micro-buses as a  
subversive element. If they discovered that I was sharing *real*  
Canadian Beer at EveryBus I can't be certain that I wouldn't be sent  
to Syria for &quot;questioning&quot;.

The other reason not to bring a Keg to EB is the slosh factor. The  
way I brew, there's about an inch of sediment at the bottom of the  
keg. And the way my trailer rides, the beer would be VERY cloudy by  
the time I got to EveryBus, and it would take the sediment several  
days to settle. Which is time that isn't allowed for in this year's  
schedule.

The Keg was taken to BOTC last year, and the tap performed well;  
though we used too much ice trying to chill the keg . I built an  
inline chiller at BusQuinox in September, and the results were  
perfect; I don't think any further testing will be required.

But don't panic. I do plan to bring a batch of &quot;Red Star Ale&quot; to  
Everybus 2007 packaged in easy-to-conceal 2L bottles.

Happy Trails,

Greg Potts

&gt; Are you sure you don't have that backwards Greg? Sounds like a tap  
&gt; &amp; keg would need a good test period to confirm it works great. I'd  
&gt; be more than happy to help in that arena as well ;)
