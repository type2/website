&gt; With all this paint discussion, I picked up on a string where someone said
&gt; &quot;(paraphrased) you can go to an auto/paint supply store and get them to mix
&gt; your color and put it in shaker cans.&quot;
&gt; 
&gt; Is that just for the camper top, or are you saying that one of those places
&gt; will put them in handheld spray cans and you can then paint an entire bus
&gt; and make it look really good?

I have used the &quot;PreVal&quot; bottles and they are ok for touch up but the cost
of painting a bus with them would be astronomical they weren't cheap.  and
while the &quot;jars&quot; are reusable they require a can of propelant that is
rather pricy...figure about $10 a load.
