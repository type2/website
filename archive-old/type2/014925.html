The 1972 rear corners are 1 year only.  The difference between the 1972 
and the 1973-79 corners is the 1972 still has the dimple &amp; hole for 
mounting the splash pan between the corner and the bumper.  When they 
changed to the squared off bumper in 1973, there was no splash pan so 
they eliminated the dimple &amp; hole.
