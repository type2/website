Subject: Auxillary Battery: Circuit Breaker(s)??
Message-Id: &lt;3.0.5.32.19990616234440.0098f520_at_mail.bhm.bellsouth_dot_net&gt;

Hello All:

I was getting ready to wire up my Auxillary Battery when I 
noticed the instructions that came with the Battery Relay Switch said:
&quot;Standard wiring practices recommend that an appropriate circuit
breaker be installed in wires attached to the battery's positive terminal.
This will minimize the possibility of accidental damage due to circuit
overload.&quot;

When I read the archives on installing an Aux. battery I didn't see anything
about circuit breakers...

Do I need one? or more?
If so, do I install it between the batteries and the connections on the
relay???
or does it go between the aux. battery and the outlet I will plugging
my inverter into?

Also, I am planning to mount the Relay onto the frame where the spare
tire well is in the engine compartment. any reason not to mount it there?
any and all advice appreciated!
thanks-
Rob
