&gt; this is the best plan i have yet heard.  we should not stick richard
&gt; with the cost of the stickers, and this allows us to avoid that, and to
&gt; distribute the cost of having spare stickers around to everyone.  i
&gt; would be happy to buy a share or two of stickers.
&gt;

&gt; 
&gt; &gt; cost thereof I would like to suggest a solution.  Don't print them until
&gt; &gt; you get the money in hand.  Here's the plan.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; You offer sticker shares at $5, or something that makes numerical sense.
&gt; &gt; If you sell enough shares for a quantity price break then the purchaser of
&gt; &gt; each share gets 7 stickers.  Not enough orders then the share is worth 5
&gt; &gt; stickers.  You close the share selling at some fixed date, like maybe
&gt; &gt; Christmas.  After that point anyone who wants a sticker must buy it from
&gt; &gt; someone who ordered a share and therefore has stickers to sell.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; The problem with this plan is that it is a lot of bookkeeping for somebody.
&gt; &gt; Sticker share buyers could maybe fill out a little form to help with the
&gt; &gt; bookkeeping.  Like
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; name:    _________________________ | shares purchased:_____________
&gt; &gt; street:  _________________________ |        money collected:_________
&gt; &gt; City/state________________________ |        stamp enclosed? _________
&gt; &gt;                                    |  name again:____________________
&gt; &gt; Then maybe just tape the left half of the form to an envelope and mail the
&gt; &gt; stickers using the enclosed stamp.  Processing even a hundred of these
&gt; &gt; could be a pain, but we're all VW van owners.  What's a little discomfort
&gt; &gt; for all this community and history?
&gt; &gt;

I'm new here so forgive me.  The above plan is prolly workable but very cumbersome and open 
to market making and profiteering. (---&lt; Happy Republican and proud of it along with profit, 
but it is after all just stickers to ID each other.)  Why not just collect the money up 
front?  Is this a community?  It really sounds like one to me.  As I have been reading this 
thread now for about two weeks I find some things very interesting.  1)  You have respect 
for each other.  2)  I like that, and would like to count my self as a member of this happy 
little family.  3)  I would not have a problem sending $5, $10, or $20 to someone here.  

Reason is we all love our VW's and for some of us there is a substantial investment of our 
lives in not only the vehicles we drive but this community we are a part of.  Does $20 bucks 
 sound like a lot money?  Sure does, (especially when outta work :( ) but not lot in the 
larger scheme of things.  Just tell me how much for a pack of 5 and away we go!
