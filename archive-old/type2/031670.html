&gt; I'm going to clarify a few points.
and still more clarification
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;there are two basic models, the early ones 73-75 were vacuum shift models
&gt; &gt;the later ones 76-79 were govenor shift models. the final drive was the
&gt; 
&gt; Final housing casting is not the same, the governor is in the final.

correct, but the rest of the drive, shafts etc were the same
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;the early ones are much harder to find parts for and adjust. the later
&gt; &gt;ones were internally almost identical to the Golf/Rabbit auto tranny so
&gt; &gt;the parts are still relatively avaliable 
&gt; 
&gt; Identical in fact to some Audi tranies, and identical in toto to Vanagon
&gt; automatics through '91 with a few exceptions.  Any golf/rabbit tranny only

not quite the same as a Vanagon

&gt; era up to whenever it switched.  The Vanagon assemblies are bolt into
&gt; a bus up to when they have oil coolers on them for sure.  I think after
&gt; that the oil cooler could be a physical space issue (though you can leave
&gt; it disconected.)

the oil coolers get in the way, also the shift linkage is on the other
side of the box. can be a real hassle switching em

&gt; &gt;be fantastic for city driving...there are other advantages to. it is next
&gt; &gt;to impossible to over rev or lug the engine, the tranny shifts for you.
&gt; 
&gt; Ahh but on the '82 I've noticed a really bad problem, because when
&gt; you get off the gas the torque converter permits the engine to fall back
&gt; nearly to idle, the auto is death on engine cooling.  Scenario is this, you

haven't noticed that problem, also I just stay on the accelereator a
little to keep the rev's up

&gt; &gt;76 or later for sure.  BTW you can put an late tranny in an early auto
&gt; &gt;bus. vice versa is a little harder but doable
&gt; 
&gt; Or as I've mentioned about any tranny unit VW ever made from '78-'90
&gt; and any complete Vanagon unit tranny and final.

again not without some work.. the front mounts on a vanagon are slightly
different, the shifter is on the other side in a vanagon and the oil
cooler won't fit
