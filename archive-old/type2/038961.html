&gt;&gt; I had a conversation tonight with Topher Waring, of Riverside School,
&gt;&gt; Lyndonville, VT 05851 tonight.  He's a shop teacher who yearly
disassembles
&gt;&gt; and rebuilds an all electric 71 Westy with his middle school kids to run
in
&gt;&gt; the NorthEast Sustainable Energy Association American Tour de Sol
&gt;&gt;
(http://www.ipd.anl_dot_gov/ttrdc/research/student_competitions/tour_de_sol/amer

&gt;&gt; Great guy, from one talk to him.  Basically, he got the kids (the kids,
now)
&gt;&gt; to create a conversion plate from 1/2&quot; tempered aluminum, and bolts a 19
hp
&gt;&gt; electric motor onto the standard tranny (spline to spline fitting by a
local
&gt;&gt; machine shop).  16 12v deep cycle batteries give it a working range of 52
&gt;&gt; miles, 72 max on 144V at 500A.  Solar panels on the roof are good for
about
&gt;&gt; 15% of the energy he needs for the tour, the rest is recharged on a wire
at
&gt;&gt; the overnight stops.  The kids come along and do the explaining and
upkeep.
&gt;&gt; During the school year it's used as a gofer vehicle for the school and as
a
&gt;&gt; real school bus.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; I recommend you check it out and send the school your beer money for next
&gt;&gt; Saturday night, check made out to Helios Project.  They started with a
&gt;&gt; standard bus and gutted the engine and tank.  The kids did the rest and
it
&gt;&gt; looks great.  My hat's off to him.  His email is tymzdork_at_sover_dot_net .
Would
&gt;&gt; I make this up?
