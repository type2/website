Subject: survey says...0n 71 mis fires...also CV joints

Thank you so much for everyone's input,
    Most everyones said condenser so far, took it out today picking up the 
new one tommorow, I'll start there and then try the coil.

CV joints ..I have a used good drive axle with CV joints on it to replace the 
left side that's only acting up after a long drive or when it's cold out. 
Trouble is I replaced the right side a long time ago and kept it all together 
now I can't remember which is which, Is there a way to determine which one is 
good while it's all together and not installed. Yes, I know I should have 
marked the bad one. 

    Andy        71 Westy lot's o rust but when she runs look out!
