Subject: [T2] Tin Snip question


&gt; I want to go to my local Junk Yard to get some body pannels.  Can anyone
&gt; recomend some portable cutters to remove bits.  Thinks of wheel well parts
&gt; rear corners, pedistals.

Cutting torch not allowed ?
Plasma cutter not portable?
An inexpensive power inverter will provide the
current you need to use drill, grinder, sawzall,
soldering iron, lamps, and extension cords.
It makes all your regular power tools portable.
Can't take in your vehicle ? Bring a battery.
