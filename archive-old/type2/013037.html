&gt; Hi Folks,
&gt;
&gt; I replaced the clutch on my new 70 westy this past weekend. The shifting
&gt; fork was busted, so I had to take the one from my other 70 to fix it. 
&gt; All
&gt; went well and I am eager to drive the bus, but I have no brake lights.

I ran into problems with the tail and brake lights on my '71 after 
pulling my engine
and found that filing/sanding the corrosion off of the terminals (on 
each rear light
assembly) and replacing the connectors solved my problem.  Kind of a 
pain,
but it made me feel a lot safer after I found out one day that i had 
driven 30
miles without tail or brake lights.

YMMV,
