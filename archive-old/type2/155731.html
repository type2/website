Subject: Re: [T2] Koni Bus Shocks are Back - Get 'em while you can!

&gt; Don,
&gt;
&gt; What are your present impressions on the changes these shocks have made to
&gt; the driveability of your bus?
&gt;

I've had 'em on two busses now, with wildly different settings. The &quot;glide
ride&quot; of the Guac with Konis on full soft or the &quot;Camaro ride&quot; of the GWB
with 'em full hard. And I've mixed and matched. It's just amazing the
difference in ride from playing with settings. But regardless, I've seen
drastic improvements in wind resistance, handling, and braking. All measured
by the seat of my pants though.
