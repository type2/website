Hi Mike,

I'll gladly take some of that &quot;off of I-10&quot; info that you might have found
to be worthy of passing on to others.

I gotta do the I-10 thing the last week of June. Gonna go to S.F. where I
grab Mary Beth off of a plane, and we then go up Oregon and Washington. I
will jag on up and drive Route 66, of course, for the good stretch West of
Albuquerque, but what other sideys do you find of value off of I-10?

Mary Beth will fly back home from Seattle, and I then proceed back East
and will be in territory I have never ever seen before. I'm looking
forward to that leg, as well.

Mary Beth and I spent last weekend at Luckenbach and the hill country.
It was really nice, but not as fun as 2 weeks ago when the temp fell into
the 50's for an unseasonably low sleeping night.
Now, that was nice !

Bob in Houston
