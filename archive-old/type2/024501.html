&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; did not come over well. But am I right in cutting a 4&quot; square hole in
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; the middle &amp; 4&quot; back from the 45 degree of the wheel arch section?
&gt;&gt;&gt; All I can say, is don't cut your bus there!!!!!
&gt;&gt;I came in late.  Why do people make this cut?
&gt;It's an easy way to change the Fuel tank sender without pulling the
&gt;engine.
&gt;I've done it twice with no side effects, and would do it again.

This is a prime example of a &quot;slash and burn&quot; repair job. Someone's fuel
guage isn't working well and it annoys them.
Instead of buying a fuel sender and having it ready, meanwhile keeping
track of your mileage and fill-ups on a notepad
until you're ready to pull the motor for other reasons, then take that
opportunity to R&amp;R the fuel sender and  tank when
 the motor is out, someone got the idea to saw a hole in the floor of the
bus above the fuel tank area and replace the sender
that way. Who cares about the structural integrity of the van, that fact
that the road and motor sounds and fumes will begin
to inevitable pollute the bus through this hole.
