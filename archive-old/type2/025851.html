&gt; The above line is a dead giveaway but I checked it out anyway.  This cooler
&gt; is cooled by a peltier device.  I'm on another list which recently
&gt; discussed these in depth.  I'll summarize for you - they are much less
&gt; efficient than compressor driven refrigerators and will take hours to cool
&gt; down a couple of sodas.

Definitely don't get a Peltier device refrigerator. My brother bought one
and reports that not only didn't it keep the food all that cold, but it
drained the batteries in his vehicle overnight. And he was using it in a
1997 Freightliner truck. You ever see the batteries in those things?
