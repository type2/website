&gt; It had been about an hour since it had been overheated and run out of
&gt; oil, so it wasn't stone cold, but it also wasn't hot.  It wouldn't turn
&gt; by the ignition key, or by  with a wrench on the generator nut, or by
&gt; bringing in the clutch in 2nd gear with two people pushing the bus down a
&gt; slight hill.

I had intended to clarify that by saying &quot;make sure you use a wrench and
not just the starter&quot; ... which you obviously did.
