Subject: RE: [T2] tail lights anyone?

&gt; If anyone has a spare set of tail lights lenses only, I'm looking
&gt; to get a set for my 1976 Deluxe Westfalia.  Ten bucks apiece plus
shipping?


Sometimes it pays to check out new pricing before looking for used parts.
You may get a pleasant surprise.  Brand new lenses are about that price
($12.95 each) from me.  (Plus an extra 5% listmember discount if your total
order exceeds $50.)
