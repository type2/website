Subject: RE: [T2] Distributeur and progressive weber kit

&gt;From: Marck Savoie Voyer I bought a new weber progressive kit and a guy 
&gt;told me that I would need to buy a 009 distributor to installe my carb. Is 
&gt;this true?

Nope you can use a vacuum advance.

&gt;Any thoughts/infos to make the best installation of the progressive 
&gt;weber??!

Did directions or instruction manual come with the kit? I have never bought 
a kit before, new that is.
If not try here:

You should be able to find almost anything that you might need.
