&gt;  The type 4 engine does have fairly high
&gt; compression, you wouldn't run a 60's muscle car on low octane would you?
VW
&gt; called for leaded 91 octane when the engine was new and the gas was
better,
&gt; what are we burning now?

Well....I believe, in the USA, the early 70's was the start of low-lead and
unleaded. In a bus, 72 was the 1st year of the type 4 engine. My 77 owners
manual says to use regular unleaded fuel with a catalytic converter which I
have. It also says to use regular low-lead or unleaded fuel of 91 RON octane
rating without a cat.
91 RON is NOT the same as 91 octane as marked on the pumps today.

From page 26 of my owners manual:
''Regular fuels have an octane rating ranging from 91 to 95 RON [research
octane number] or 87 to 91 CLC [US Cost of Living Council Octane rating].
The 91 RON octane rating, which you will find on a plate, visable after
taking off the filler cap is based on the research method. The CLC octane
rating usually displayed on U S gas pumps is calculated as follows: research
octane number plus motor octane number , divided by 2.

That is  RON + MON
             ------------------
                       2
The CLC octane rating is usually 4 points less than the RON rating:
91 RON equals 87 CLC
95 RON equals 91 CLC''

The octane rating has not changed, only a more accurate way of rating it.
Sure, they took the lead out but the octane is the same.
