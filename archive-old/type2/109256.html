Subject: Re: [T2] BB in vacuum line?

Should I do this with the engine running? When I did it with engine off I
get no vacuum.

&gt; Get a vacuum hose and just attach it to the small nipple on the EEC valve.
Pull vacuum with your mouth [suck
&gt; on the hose] and then stick the tip of your tongue on the end of the hose.
Does it hold vacuum? Or does it
&gt; lose vacuum? Hold is good.....  Lose is bad.
