	I've always meant to replace the points with a Hall Effect Whatsit. The Whatsit is a solid-state module that sits in the distributor where the points used to but doesn't rely on a mechanical switch opening and closing to send spark to the plugs. It also eliminates the need for a seperate condenser. Whatsits cost around $60-$70 and ideally only take a few minutes to install. They are set in the factory for the correct dwell and never need to be adjusted. They (according to the manufacturer) greatly increase the spark and so improve power, mileage, karma and the desirability of the driver to the opposite sex (or the desired desiring sex whatever it may be).
	I was at one of the area Veedub shops picking up another part and they had a Compu-Fire (one brand name of whatsit) on hand that they swore would fit my dizzie. I took a chance and picked it up, in spite of the numerous posts I'd seen here concerning the feed-through grommets, etc. included with it. I should have known better, especially as my distributor (like just about everything else in the Beast) isn't original. Sure enough, it didn't fit. The grommet was unusable and the module itself didn't fit the advance plate. I returned it (now adding a second 45 minute trip to my time-saving decision to pick up the wrong part because it was convenient. Moral?), made some inquiries to Pertronix (another brand name of whatsit, the better one in my opinion), a reputable mail order house (Hi Ron!) and my normal local Veedub shop. Sure enough, all three told me I needed a different part. I decided to bite the bullet and spend the extra money to buy it locally on the assumption that I w!
ould likely need to exchange it once. I went to Bow Wow with the Bosch parts number for my distributor, points, rotor, etc in hand and sure enough even Pertronix had it wrong.

	An aside; it's been extrememly helpful to me to have these part numbers written down, as EVERY time I've bought distributor parts (especially points) I've made two trips! I finally wrote down the correct Bosch parts numbers for the cap, rotor, points, condenser, cap/rotor kit and points/condenser kit (as I discovered them) in the inside cover of my Idiot's Guide and whole-heartedly recommend that everyone do the same!

	Back to the Pertronix Ignitor. Cool toy! I removed the distributor, and removed the stock points, the condenser (replaced the condenser screw as it holds on one side of the vacuum advance) and placed the points, condenser and points screw in an envelope which now lives with my other &quot;road&quot; parts supply in case the Pertronix ever fails. Pertronix recommends this in the instructions and it makes perfect sense.As tired as I am of messing with points I'd much rather be fiddling with feeler gauges in the dark in the rain on the side of the road than just sitting there butting my head against the side of the van.
	Next I press the &quot;sender&quot; magnet ring onto the distributor shaft. It has &quot;nodes&quot; that will fit over the nodes of the cam for the old points. The Pertronix doesn't retard cylinder #3 so it doesn't matter which way it lines up. Slip it on, turn it on the shaft until you feel it line up and then press it on. Finish by putting the rotor back on the shaft and using it to press it down.
	The whatsit comes with a little mounting plate that sits on the advance plate right where the points did. make sure the peg sits in the hole and screw that little puppy down with the included flat head screw. Now set the module on the studs and see if the bottom of the module is at the same height (more or less) as the bottom of the sender ring. If not, a spacer is included to lift the module. Try that.
	One hole for the mounting studs is a slot; that is, it allows for adjustment of the airgap between the sender ring and the sensor module. The whatsit comes with a plastic feeler gauge to set the gap. Tighten it down once it's set. Put the rotor on the shaft and give everything a spin to make sure nothing binds/rubs/bursts into flame.
	Two grommets are included. Pick the one you like. For my weird-ass distributor, the wires came off the module on the wrong end to be able to go directly out the whole. Instead I threaded them under the advance plate and all the way around the shaft (had to cut off Pertronix's connectors to do so but I was going to have to do that to lengthen their wires anyway). Give the advance a push and the shaft a few twirls, again, to make sure that nothing is chafing/rubbing/binding/burning/etc.
	Bolt the distributor back in. Connect the black wire to the negative side of the coil (the side the old condenser wire went to) and the red wire to the positive side (the side the old condenser DIDN'T go to). Fire that bad boy up. Set the timing. Don't she just purr?

	It runs like a champ. One thing, however. Now my Tach needle jumps around like Amanda Plummer on a quad mocha. Presumably because the sensor wire for the tach is connected to the same leads as the Pertronix. Anyone have any feedback? Advice? Similar experiences?
