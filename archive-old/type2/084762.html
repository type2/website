&gt;I also have found thin nonmagnetic (aluminum?) flakes in the oilscreen

&gt;By loose on the journal, do you mean it was spinning against the
&gt;backside(rodside)?  Also, if it's the rodbearing, why would the thin
&gt;material in the oilscreen appear to be aluminum, not bronze?  Can anyone
&gt;comment on the chemistry of finding out what's in the screen?

If it's aluminum, my first guess would be shavings from the head, 
from unshimmed valve springs.
