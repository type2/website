Subject: Re: [T2] How embarrassing...

Please consider the purchase of a CO2 extinguisher...

1)  It will ALWAYS be good, unlike the powder extinguishers that pack
down over time and are useless.  Nothing worse than grabbing a dead
extinguisher when you really need one.  And that's the nature of the use
- it sits forever until you really need it.

2)  You can use it multiple times before refill, depending on your incident.

3)  No messy cleanup, so you don't have to seriously consider if that
little wisp of smoke justifies the mess.  Many folks have commented on
how it took 'em 5 minutes to fix the problem, but hours to clean up the
powder after an incident.

4)  Refillable.

YES, they are considerably more expensive than the kidde or whatever
cheapie, but call your local fire extinguisher company - you might be
able to get a used, refilled, certified one from them.

EVERY powder extinguisher I ever owned went bad, only to be discovered
later during bus cleanups (eek!) - but now I'm confident that if I need
it, it's there with the CO2.  I paid $80 for my used unit from a company
that came into my work for their required annual inspection- I consider
every penny well spent.  In the 3-4 years since I purchased it, I could
have gone thru that many cheapies for the peace of mind.

When it comes to the safety of your family or your bus - wanna throw the
dice?

If I were queen of the world, this would be standard required equipment
with every vehicle, and would be a checklist item on any inspection.
