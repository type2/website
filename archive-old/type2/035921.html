Subject: Re: Genuine VW parts from dealers?

Gentlepersons-
                       ...Same deal (or lack thereof), from a dealer- 
formerly Air-Cooled Auto-
motive in Maplewood, NJ. Not even a look at the books/microfiche...just a 
flat out no-
thing available for anything that old. BUT...they do display an old bug on 
the sales floor.
Completely restored... where did they get the parts? 
Tony in NJ (W.A.S.T.E.)
