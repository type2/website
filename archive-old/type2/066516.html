&gt; definite bad idea...or am I just being overly cautious?

Hi Roy

When I redid the brakes on my '60 bug (hadn't run in 6 years), there
was a film of rust inside the drums too.  There was enough good metal
on the drums, and they're round.

I used fine grit sandpaper to clean them off.  No problems for 2 years
of light driving since I did the brakes.  But do use the best mask you
can.  Thise brake drums have asbestos dust in them, and asbestos dust
*will* kill you at some point in the future if you breathe it today.
