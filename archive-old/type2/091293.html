Subject: 68 Westy Engine Swap - Success!

Long story short - I successfully swapped out the bad
engine in my 68 Westy with a good used engine from
Joe at Busted Bus.  Thanks Joe!  I'm pretty much a 
newbie to vw's, so the type2_dot_com website and archives 
were also invaluable!  

I'm totally psyched to be back on the road with my bus.  
Now I can get back to fixing all the lesser problems 
like no heat, crappy steering, etc.

The new (to me) engine is way quieter and smoother,
but I'm still lacking power in a serious way.  I live
at 7300 feet and need enough power to cruise at 
highway speeds but I am not looking for a speed demon.  
What would be worthwhile (and relatively cheap) ways to 
improve the power of my bus?  

The current engine is a 1500 or 1600 depending on 
whether it was ever rebuilt with the  1600 P&amp;C set.  
The distributor is an 009 and it has a Solex 30 Pict-1 
carb.  I'm replacing the points with the Compufire 
deal.  I'd also consider replacing the carb (with 
duals?) and/or going with a CDI setup.  Any 
suggestions?  Oh yeah, I also have a header exhaust
system with an unknown muffler.

Thanks,
Brad Baker
