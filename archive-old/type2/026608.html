Subject: What are these 17mm bolts on the head for?
Date: Thu, 19 Oct 2000 09:36:37 -0400

I am trying to get a spare engine running, to install in my '72 bus.  I went
to bolt on the intake manifolds (manifolds are for dual delloroto carbs) and
ran into a problem.  The right side (cylinder 1 and 2) is fine, but the left
side (cylinders 3 and 4) has two, 17mm bolts, one located very close to the
upper right intake manifold mounting stud, and the other located near the
upper left stud.  The bolts interfere with the manifold.  What are these
bolts for, and can I remove them without causing problems?
