Subject: Fuel injection problem
Date: Thu, 5 Apr 2001 21:41:01 -0700
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

Just got my 76 bus back from the shop after a complete tune-up.  He did a
valve job points etc.
I also had him check the emisions because it seemed to be running rich, he
leaned up the mixture right before I left and I drove home, barely, it has
no power like it did on the way there.  Do I need a new fuel injection thing
or just the needs to tune it bettter?  what happened?   I wish I knew how to
do this myself, any pointers?

Thanks,
Bob
