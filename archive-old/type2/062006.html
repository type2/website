Subject: Update: Sailing the Maritimes transporter style

A couple of weeks [maybe three?] ago I posted the suggestion [and
volunteered to organise] of a touring the Maritime provinces plus
Newfoundland and Labrador next summer.  The message was also a straw
poll to see how much, if any interest, there was for this idea on the
two lists.

I received over twenty responses from listees saying that they would
be willing to participate in this adventure [the Inuvik trekkers
were still on the road then...so I imagined that that most of them
missed that message].

This posting is an update of what has happened thus far.

There were two themes common to the bulk of replies I received to the
initial posting:

        - a significant number of people wished to schedule the trip
        for an August time frame.

        - Many wanted to keep the daily driving down [in comparison to
        the regime of the Inuvik trip] so that we can &quot;stop and smell
        more flowers&quot; along the way. 


I have contacted the Ministries of Tourism of the provinces we would
be visiting.  They are all sending I there '96 information kits and
calendars and will be sending the '97 version as soon as it is
available. 

I have contacted the National Parks Service and should be receiving
information and rates/booking kits for the National Parks in the
region. I am in the process of doing the same with the Provincial Park
authorities.

I am talking with Marine Atlantic with respect to obtaining a group
rate on the ferry between Cape Breton and Newfoundland.

There are a few &quot;Special&quot; events in the Maritimes and Newfoundland and
Labrador next year, that we may be able to fit into the agenda:

        [New Brunswick]:  The Funday Parkway should be open [at least
                        in part].  This parkway will follow the
                        coastline of the Bay of Funday [World's
                        Highest Tides].

        [New Brunswick
         &amp; P.E.I.]:     The fixed link [aka: Whopping Huge Bridge],
                        between the mainland [NB] and Prince Edward
                        Island opens next summer...we can be the first
                        caravan of VW trekkers accross ;)

        [Newfoundland]: The Hybernia drilling platform [a gizillion
                        tonnes of concrete] is scheduled to be towed
                        out to sea sometime next summer...it may be
                        possible to see this thing assembled and ready
                        to sail.

Tim Smith [the other list member from Fredericton] has &quot;agreed&quot; to
help out with the itinerary planning, so there will be a broader scope
to the &quot;items of note&quot;.

I am still looking for someone down NC or Virginia way who would be
willing to co-ordinnate a &quot;drive up the New England coast&quot; for those
of you who would be coming from the US.

Finally, there is always room for more...if you are interested in
coming along...drop and E-mail.

I hope to have a tentative itinerary set by October and have information
kits ready to mail out to those participating by Christmas :-).

Bugs &amp; Things &amp; Splits...Oh, my!

Roy
