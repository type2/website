Subject: New VW heat exchangers
Date: Sun, 22 Apr 2001 20:47:32 +0200

I took a deep breath and splashed on the original VW heater boxes - I now
have a brand new exhaust system. The difference is amazing, I can barely
hear the engine now compared to before. It was a difficult choice but in the
end finding original parts like these was too good an opportunity to pass
by.

I don't have any extra gauges on my van and rely on the dipstick test to
keep track of the engine temperature. When I first bought the van I could
hardly touch the dipstick, this improved a great deal once I ripped out the
PO's home made engine seal and replaced it with a new one. After driving for
a couple of hours the dipstick was sometimes hot but never too hot to grip
and pass the test. The new heat exchangers have made another huge
difference, I took the van out for a couple of hours hard driving and this
time the dipstick was cool, barely warm!! That's got to be good for the
engine, hasn't it?

The Goodyear Cargo tires I bought have improved the handling and stability
but added some extra noise in the cab, overall I'm pleased with them. Once I
get the fuel tank vents sorted out I think I'll be clear for a good summer's
camping, with only some superficial rust to treat.

Which brings me to another question - is it possible to take out windows
without destroying the seals? There are a few spots of rust coming through
which will require the windows out to be treated properly, before I get
started I need to know whether to order new window seals or not.

I really appreciate all the advice and assistance, once I'm more experienced
with my van I hope to be able to contribute as much as I ask!

Cheers
