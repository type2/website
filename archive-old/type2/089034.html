&gt; I dug around a little bit and I'm certain that the 914 motors (1.7, 1.8,
&gt; 2.0) use the exact same cam which is the exact same cam as the 72-77
&gt; non-hydrualic bus motors.  It is my belief that the difference in HP is due
&gt; in part to the bigger valves, but as you well know, bigger valves don't mean
&gt; didly unless the engine can breathe.

Same solid lifter cam. 914 1.7 was D-jet FI

&gt;Both engines have close to the same
&gt;compression ratio (ranging from 125 - 135).

This is not a compression ratio, it is a compression test.

&gt; So I had my heads
&gt; machined to fit.  What I ended up with was the much smaller valves for a 1.7
&gt; with the bigger cylinders of the 1.8.  I had KILLER low-end torque in that
&gt; thing (running dual Webers of course).
&gt;I attribute the low-end power to the smaller valves.

The smaller combustion chamber of the 1.7 heads
increased the compression ratio. This is the power secret.
Vacuum increased from the smaller valves,
it gives that low end  torque increase,
but wimps out at the top end.
