Subject: [T2] parts vendor

this may be another candidate for parts vendor lists.
i recently did some front wheel maintenance.
thru Smothers International, santa rosa, ca, http://www.smothers_dot_com/ , i 
paid $46.82 ea for LOADED [includes new pads, pins,etc] Bendix 
remanufactured calipers and $1.52 ea for Beck front wheel seals.
these prices were considerably better than anything else i could find online 
or locally, even tho it cost $15 to rtn the cores.
shipping cost is whatever UPS charges.
i was told that they have a lot more vw parts than are listed online.
easy to navigate site and 800#. good service.
i'm new to the type 2 site, are there any vendor lists other than jim 
fournier's in the library??
bus depot is the best for online general parts i've seen referenced on the 
site, anybody very pleased w someone else??
thanks
