Subject: Big problem....maybe
Message-ID: &lt;373349F4.2BBBC16_at_mail.ripon.k12.wi_dot_us&gt;

I have what I think could be a big problem....I went over today to look
at the bus I am going to buy next week.  I was in the drivers seat and I
pushed the clutch in and shifted through the gears to move it aside so I
could get into the back.  When I shifted it the shifter moved wayyyyy
over to the right and swiveled around so that what should be facing the
back of the bus....faces the front of the bus.....when I try to move it
back....it only goes half way.....but it feels and sounds like I'm
shifting in and out of the gears....1st and reverse anyways....when I
shift into what I think is first (as far as it will come over to the
left) it makes this god-awful expensive sounding metal on metal
sound....like its scraping rust off of something....HELP ME!!
Is this bad..should I abort buying the bus for 900 bucks when it was
appraised at 3000 dollars???
I did this all with the engine off.....do I just need to start it and
shift...will that fix it??? The guy who owns it wasn't there so I
couldn't do that...
BTW its a 71 hardtop westfalia....
really good condition too...never had any problems like this b4.

Thanks sooo much...any advice / price quotes / fixes are greatly
appreciated!
