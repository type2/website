Subject: Re: [T2] WHAT HAVE I DONE?

&gt;I thought i put enough oil in.i drove about 5 blocks to the gas station and it
&gt;wasn't running very good.

Did you put in about 4 quarts? I think technically it is 3.6 quarts.

&gt;very low power.at the gas station i looked at the engine and i went to check
&gt;the oil.it was nearly empty.oh no.
&gt;so i filled the engine with oil and it barely started.it seemed to run okay
&gt;after it started so i went on my way.
&gt;i was heading down the freeway and i could hear a chattering noise like the
&gt;valves were loose.and then i heard
&gt;what sounded like a metal can bouncing around in the engine.sound seemed to
&gt;come from right side.
&gt;the engine died and then it wouldn't even turn over_dot_can anyone help me
&gt;determine what i have done?

How much oil was in the engine after you shut it off? Was it excessively 
hot? Did it lose power?

Sounds alot like a toasted engine. Rebuild it and go again.

Good luck!
