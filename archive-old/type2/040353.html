Subject: Touch up painting

If you have the paint code number, which you do, you should be able to go down to an automotive paint store (and you must have one if we do here in small town Montana) and they should be able to look it up and mix it in small quantity--I had a quart mixed for my '69 ghia, but I could have had just a pint.
Don't paint over rust.  Either sand (or sandblast) it out or use a product like POR-15 before painting your color.
Kim and Jim
