Subject: Re: [T2] 71 molding clips

From: &quot;Karl&quot; &lt;aufever_at_prodigy_dot_net&gt;
&gt; They are metal, double ended, and held on by one screw...

Thanks, Karl.  I wasn't sure if the reference was to the interior clips
(which might, maybe, be reproducible in plastic), and the exterior trim
clips which I suspected were metal and probably not reproducible in plastic.

What are the dimensions of the clip?  The #33 in the fiche seemed to be out
of scale to make it more visible.

Meanwhile, a &quot;thank you&quot; to Richard for the pics of the interior clips.  I
hadn't realized that there was a plastic &quot;cup&quot; that the clip inserted into.
Time to pull a set out of our bus for research purposes...
