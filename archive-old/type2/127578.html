&gt; You guys aren't thinking far enough outside the, uh, breadbox.

&gt; If the screens are rotting but the canvas is good, how tough would it be 
&gt; to stitch new screens in in back of the old ones?  Just overlay it and sew 
&gt; or glue the new screens -- the whole window -- in place.  Good enough if 
&gt; you mainly want to keep bugs out, and will only look kludgy if you do a 
&gt; slack job of it.

the glue idea isn't that bad of an idea. Stitching would be better,
but I'll assume youv'e never taken a close look at how big the
sportsmobile windows are :)
