Subject: RE: [T2] RE: AC Delco Alternator

&gt;&gt;There is more to this than simple stock-original-naziness.  There is a
fundamental difference in the way the bus alternator works vs. almost every
other alternator out there.  The bus alternator is fed cool air through a
duct directly into the middle of the alternator.  Other alternators rely on
recirculating the (presumably cool) air that surrounds the alternator in a
water-cooled car who's engine is open to the atmosphere.  If the AC Delco
alternator was mounted in the stock bus location it would suck super-hot air
in from around the heads and exhaust and fry itself very quickly because it
is NOT DESIGNED to work in such a hot, confined space.


You know my alternator from my Fiat X1/9 is designed to have an air scoop
feed fresh air from the outside against its back through a flexible tin
hose. If someone was really intent on putting a GM or other alternator I bet
they could create some way to mount such a setup onto the new alternator,
cut a hole in the cooling tin (with a gasket of course) and then run the
hose up to the air vent with some sort of scoop to catch the force-fed air
(or some sort of fan to force cool air onto the alternator. But then again,
what a PIA!
