Subject: Re: [T2] Tranny dating

&gt; Hmmm, then there should be three general types, the early one with no rear
&gt; mount holes and no holes for the throwout bearing sleeve, the middle type
&gt; (perhaps '71 only?) with the sleeve but not the rear mount holes, and the
&gt; late type with all the holes.  Correct?

Uhm, my technical English is not that good that I know what a 'throwout
bearing sleeve' is. Is that what Bentley calls the &quot;clutch release
bearing&quot; (CRB) on page 17 of section 6? If you are then probably the
1971 tranny is pretty unique yes. I think the old CRB was only used
until 1970 (had to replace it once on my 1970 policevan, it was hard to
get). If I remember well the parts manual said &quot;until chassisnr 2102 300
000&quot; meaning 'until the end of modelyaer 1970&quot;.

Oh well, every modelyear of the T2 is quite unique, especially the first
6 years, you can tell them apart by only looking at the outside.
