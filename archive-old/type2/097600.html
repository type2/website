Subject: [T2] Stranded - Bad Starter? HELP!


&gt; Symptoms: Key in, turn to Start, no sound.  Voltage is at 12v, idiot
lights
&gt; go on, but nothing - not even a click - from the starter.  I bridged
across
&gt; the starter terminals, and the starter runs (whizzzz!), but it doesn't
&gt; engage the flywheel.  I heated the starter and solenoid with a torch to
&gt; un-freeze anything that might be frozen, but still had the same results -
no
&gt; luck.

You must bridge the solenoid spade terminal to activate it.
Bypassing the solenoid will verify only the starter winding.
This is why the starter spins but doesn't engage the flywheel.
Resistance in the ignition circuit is eliminated when you go
directly from the battery hot input to either the solenoid or the starter
winding. This long ignition circuit electrical path can be suplemented
with a relay which uses the circuit for signal only.  That $2 relay has
solved a lot of starter headaches for many people.

&gt; Questions: Is the solenoid bad?  Is the starter bad?  Is the wiring bad?
&gt; Should the starter engage and start the engine if I bridge across the
&gt; starter terminals?  Is there anybody in the greater Boston area that has a
&gt; good starter for cheap?  Can I replace the starter with the engine and
trans
&gt; in the car?

The starter and solenoid may be disassembled for a tune-up.
Cleaning the electrical components will often restore proper function
for many more years. It's not very complicated. Is it worth an hour ?
