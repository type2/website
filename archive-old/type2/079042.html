&gt; Dave has an excellent point! Check the injector seal on #2, wiggle the
&gt; injector a bit and see if it may not be leaking.

I drove from Baltimore to Harrisburg today up I-83 and back..stayed up
there about 4hours so had time for the engine to cool off.

had a total of 11 missed firings in 150 miles some pretty stiff rolling
countryside...never fell below 55 on the hills cruised at the limit of 65
most of the way.....no pattern that I can determine.  

last night replaced the #2 Sparkplug wire.

&gt; I am off to work on hte beam some more, be back this evening!

oh fun job, did mine about 2 months ago
