The hose should be attached with a nipple either on the air filter top or 
bottom, or intake manifold under the carb. I prefer the manifold as the oil 
mist through the carb will leave some deposits to build up over time on the 
throttle and venturi. Not a problem if you keep the oil clean at all times, 
but most don't, they tend to wait until it is dark with carbon enough for 
varnish to form from overload of detergents. Manifold entry for crankcase 
breathing reduces carb cleaning maintenance, but most engineered systems do 
enter upstream of the throttle baffle, typically into the air filter box, 
both on carb and FI systems.
