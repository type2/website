Subject: final post

Well, after about 3 years of mostly lurking and occasional posts, I am
signing off.  I sold &quot;Klunk&quot; my 80 Westy last Sunday to a gentleman in
Jacksonville.  I appreciate all the words of wisdom and I am glad I got to
participate in the &quot;Great Bus Tour&quot;  I'm sure I will find my way back,
because I don't see myself being capable of busslessness for more than a few
years.  So until then, may all your trips be memorable (hopefully not for
breaking down) and may your CVs hold out better than mine did.  I will keep
my listing on AIRS and will always lend a hand to bussers in need.  Thanks.
