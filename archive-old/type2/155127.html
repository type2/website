Subject: Re: [T2] Welders, white courtesy phone...

&gt; &gt; Yeah, I know about the ones at Harbor Freight...But even if everything &quot;will&quot;
&gt; &gt; be Chinese made, I'd like to give us locals a chance at keeping their jobs...

Beware of the import welders. Where are you going to get parts in 2
years? 

Made in China everywhere you look. In 10-15 years who here will have a
decent enough job to buy any of their stuff? &lt;ugh!&gt; 

See the UAW guys who are about be right out of a job (see GM and
Delphi). Doesn't matter - GM and Ford and many others are in the process
of moving their production lines to China so the UAW issue is only a
temporary problem. I think the big car makers are filing for bankruptcy
so they can just shed the UAW retirement benefits befor emoving much
more production out of the country. 

The next time you see a Harley with some in-your-face dude riding it,
remind him the plastic gas tank under his seat (the shiny one on top is
for looks) is made in Taiwan. We built the machine that assembles and
tests it (in America with Taiwanese H-D parts).
