Subject: Re: [T2] Stripped Allen Head bolts =(

&gt; So, despite my best efforts (Soaking the bolts in pb blaster on the
&gt; &gt; front and back side, hex bit on a socket) I still managed to strip the
&gt; &gt; 3 allen bolts that holds the fan onto the hub.

Next time (AFTER you've cleaned the holes for the Allen wrench...),
insert the wrench and tap it a few times with a screwdriver handle
or somesuch to vibrate the bolt...Then, tap the wrench clockwise
a few times before attempting to remove the bolt...A mechanic
I know swears he gets better results removing old nuts and bolts
by first going clockwise and then counterclockwise... YMMV, of
course... ;-(
