Probably won't make much difference unless you install a hotter 
ignition, i.e. CDI.  With CDI, you can gap the plug wider and get a 
better burn in the cylinder.

&gt; I've heard mixed reports on .009 distro's. What about Porche distro's
&gt; and/or OTHER Bosches?

If you already have a vacuum-advance distributor, keep it (as long as 
it is functioning properly).  If not, get one.  aircooled_dot_net's SVDA is 
good.
