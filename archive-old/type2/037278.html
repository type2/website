Subject: RE: Cheap buses

   I told the guy to do the same thing in a pmail....i bought a 72 westy
with a real tight body no engine for 100 bucks i also got a rebuilt 1600 dp
with 5000 miles on it for 100$...I think all the guy was saying is if you
pay 4 grand for a bus, it better be perfect....the bus this guy was talking
about was going to need major money in it to fix the body.  Theres good
deals out there, just need to be patient.  I would never pay over 1000 for a
bus, knowing what i know about them. I will find a better deal.

Subject: Cheap buses


I can't believe you are telling someone to spend $500 or less on a bus.
You must have alot of time on your hands to fix up these buses cause
anything that cheap is a project. I spent $2,000 on my '71 bus that was in
great shape but only had a stock engine 12yrs ago. I've put thousands into
the engine, body,seats, etc. I'm about to sell it and I'm going to be
asking $4,500. You get what you pay for.

&gt;&gt;The '72 Westy here that I  can't get for a
&gt;&gt;penny under 4k is going to cost another 2500 bucks to get the windshield
rust
&gt;&gt;problem and a couple of other spots and dings fixed and then painted. It
does
&gt;&gt;have a pancake w/12k on it, but I'll still have 6500 in the thing and
some of
&gt;&gt;you have already said that's too much.
&gt;
&gt;Forget about this bus. Anybody who isn't budging when you wave 3800 cash
under
&gt;his nose, is not the type of person you want to buy a bus from. He's too
worried
&gt; about
&gt;the bottom line, or he's too attached to it to let it go. Not only that,
but 12k
&gt; on a rebuilt pancake
&gt;isn't any great shakes. Just to believe that was true you'd want to check
the
&gt;odometer, all his
&gt;receipts and ask detailed questions about the rebuild. If he bought a
longblock
&gt;from GEX, well
&gt;he should pay YOU for the bus.
&gt;
&gt;In other words, you don't want to spend a huge amount on a bus. The most I
ever
&gt;spent was $1500
&gt;for my first bus, which was mint, but it was a mistake, because I didn't
know a
&gt;thing about keeping it alive and ended
&gt;up losing it anyway. After that I found a copy of the Idiot book and read
it a
&gt;few times, then paid $100 for a 77,
&gt;$100 for a 69, $125 for a 78, $100 for 66, $350 for an 80, $400 for
another 66,
&gt;$0 for a 73, $0 for a 71, and now I'm
&gt;planning on paying $500 for a 72, which is the most I'll throw down,
knowing
&gt;I'll have to sink several hundred in parts
&gt;to get it rolling.
&gt;
&gt;If you aren't willing to study the books, buy the parts and fix it
yourself, it
&gt;not economical to own a bus, and even when
&gt;you are willing to do all the repairs, the economics are questionable,
unless
&gt;you develop an eye for  a bus with potential.
&gt;I've had the best luck with the buses I've paid the least for...!  I'd
look on
&gt;the various bus classifieds on the internet, and
&gt;wait for something affordable but not mint, and in the meantime read the
book!
