&gt; I attempted to change the shoes on my bus for the first time this weekend, 
&gt; and could not get the drum off. Here's the situation:

for every car I have owned, the process of getting a drum off has
gone something along the lines of:

a) chock 3 wheels, put car in gear, jack car, remove tire, emergency brake OFF
	(not sure about the put car in gear for rear wheel drive vws, YMMV)

b) attempt to pull off drum

c) after failing, get out trusty rubber mallet and proceed to expend a great 
	deal of energy banging on drum.  2 good whacks on the front, either
	side of center, then work my way around each of the four compass
	points, one to three complete rotations.  

d) pull on and/or spin drum.  at this point the drum should spin but get 
	stuck at some point around -- or at least contact with something.
	this is good, it means the drum is (at least partially) unstuck.

e) if pulling on drum does not result in it coming off, return to 
	(c), interjecting comments and pleas to the gods as you see
	necessary.  Hitting the side that has come loose, first, i.e.
	trying to get the drum so it's completely pararallel to the 
	mount, sometimes works and after doing so you might be able
	to just pull the drum off.

f) thank the gods and repeat for other side.

you might need to use a solid hammer instead of a rubber mallet.  I have
found the need to do this at times but prefer to use the rubber mallet
where possible to not ding up my drum.  probably not a big deal either way.
remember though, you want to give it at least two FULL STRENGTH whacks
to try to break whatever seal the rust has made.

hmm...reading the above, c-&gt;e could probably be condensed to:
	hit drum twice on face with a good bit of strength, then 
	proceed to tap the drum on the side, then turn it and tap again, 
	turning the drum and tapping at the same point after turning 30 degrees
	and this seems to work well.  i.e. turn 30 degrees, bang, bang, turn 
	30 deg, bang, bang, pull, mutter, turn 30 deg, bang, bang, turn 30 deg, 
	bang, bang, pull, mutter louder, repeat...

Hope this helps, and, feel free to add this to the library as appropriate.
