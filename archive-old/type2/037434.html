Subject: Fwd:  interesting pop top

Hi,

&gt; i was surfing around and came upon this gentlemans vw
&gt; site.   he has an 80 vanagon with a huge pop top that
&gt; i have never seen the likes of before and figured id
&gt; pass it along.   it looks pretty cool to me at least.

 Looks like a Holdsworth to me, though I'm not an expert. There
are quite a few variations available in the UK (and therefore
Ireland, from whence this one was exported).
 There are poptops like this available on Baywindow busses in the
UK as well. Over here a camper with a small &quot;footprint&quot; is much
more practical than a huge RV, especially since many people
would use it as a second car and not just for holidays. One of
the attractions of the VW campers has always been that you can
parallel park them in a European sized parking space, and a big
pop-top means you can get this advantage with a lot of living
space when parked up. I think in the USA most people would just
buy a bigger RV. Here, that is an unattractive option.

Cheers,
	W.
