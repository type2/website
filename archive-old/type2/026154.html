Perry,

My '78 used to have some soft foam rubber on the back of the flaps, but this
had long since fallen to pieces when I got the bus.  You may like to stick
some rubber (or polyurethane) draft proofing strip on them (the sort you put
on doors and windows at home).  Make sure it's good and squishy or it won't
make much difference.
There is a 'nut' on the linkage (+ a locknut) that you can turn to adjust
the length.
