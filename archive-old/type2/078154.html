Don't beleive any thing you see until you have personally verified it. I have 
been working on cars for pert near 30 years and have seen both cables black, 
both cables red, one black and one red (correct), and one black and one red 
(reversed). don't trust the color, check on the battery, it is marked and it 
don't lie. From the sounds of things, you are now running off that new 
battery you just bought? You may want to test the volt.reg. and the generator 
for proper voltage and polartity.
