Subject: Brake Cable Replacement Tip

Mein Volks,

Just a helpful little tip I taught myself today while replacing the
brake cables on the ol' bus.  Pulling out the old cables was quite easy,
but putting the new ones in was pretty tough.  In my case, the tubes
that carry the cables had a little rust in them, and the new cables were
binding up on the rust as I tried to feed them up through the tube
(mostly it was that thing on the cable up near the front that keeps the
rubber sleeve in place that was binding up...it's barely smaller than
the diameter of the tube).

The trick that worked for me was to feed enough of the cable into the
tube as far as it needed to go before it would bind (about 2 feet). 
&gt;From that point, I'd grab the cable with my pliars about 1 inch from the
end of the tube, and then hammer (tap) on the head of the pliars to
force the cable into the tube.  After repeating this process a number of
times, it would free up enough so I could shove it through another
couple of feet or so.  On one side I had to go back to the &quot;hammer on
the pliars&quot; method more often.

It worked like a champ.  To protect the cable from the teeth on the
pliars, I wrapped the teeth with duct-tape.  The stiffness of the cable
makes this possible, and for me, it was the only way I could figure out
to get that cable threaded through there.

Anyway, that's my contribution for the day.

Enjoy,
