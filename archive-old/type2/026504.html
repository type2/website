&gt;Anyone want to give me a short course on how to wire a bus for 
&gt;trailer lights? The trailer has the standard 4 prong straight connection.

Assuming your trailer lights have a single bulb with dual filaments (one for
tail light, one for brake/turn signal) and assuming the 68-71 bus lights
have a seperate bulb for brake light/turn blinker like my 73 then you'll
need the infamous 'black box' trailer connector.  You can get one at any
store that sells trailer wiring kits (probably Walmart) for around $10 -
$15.
