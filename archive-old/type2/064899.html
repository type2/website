Subject: follow-up: mysterious stalls after putting in ignition relay

Greetings all:

I'd love to have you all share my pain in detail, but I'll cut to the
chase:  Last week, as some of you remember, I put a Bosch WR-1 ignition
relay kit on the 1971 engine in my 1970 bus.  It worked fine for a few
hours, then the engine abruptly stopped dead in traffic.  It turned over a
couple of times, then wouldn't even click.  When I got it home and
checked, the 15A fuse on the relay was blown.  Replaced it, all was fine
for several days.  But I didn't know what caused the original failure; 
now I have a guess that I want to test out on you folks.

Today the same thing happened again, though I didn't try to crank it this
time, just pulled off the road and checked the fuse, which was fine.  I
wiggled coil and distributor connections, including condenser and points,
to see if any were loose.  It started up.  Awhile later, it did it to me
again, only this time when I tried to start it, it blew fuses as fast as I
could change them. 

Finally [again--I'd love to tell this story properly, but you've all got
lives], I found what might be the culprit, but I want to check with the
folks in the know:  The little rubber boot on the wire from the condenser
through the base of the distributor had pulled loose [in fact, it looks
like it is the wrong size/shape to seat properly anyway]. 

&gt;From the look of it, it could easily have been shorting against the base
of the distributor.  I might easily have wiggled it up into place again
when I was checking connections earlier.  And some driving around town
might easily have wiggled it loose again.  [Its little butt is currently
duct taped into place until I can work on it in daylight.]

My question: Is this likely to have produced my bus's symptoms--sudden,
embarrassing engine failure, and blown ignition relay fuse *sometimes*
when I try to restart after a failure?  In other words, have I probably
found my short?  [If so, that would mean that it really *was* just a
coincidence that it happened right after I put the relay in, and just good
luck that the fuse was there to protect things when this short appeared.  
Go figure.]

It's sort of humbling to post rookie questions like this, given the level
of play for many on this list, though I'm sure I'm not the first beginner
to appreciate how decent all the veterans are about this sort of thing. 
It reminds me of an old, old Peanuts cartoon.  Charlie Brown, Linus, and
Schroeder are laying on a hill looking up at the sky, describing what they
see in the clouds.  Linus says he sees a map of the British Honduras. 
Schroeder says he sees the stoning of the apostle Stephen, with some of
the other apostles standing nearby.  There's a long pause, and they ask
Charlie Brown what he sees.  He tells them he was going to say he saw a
duckie and a horsie, but now he thinks he'll just keep it to himself. 

Thanks in advance.

best,
Bill
