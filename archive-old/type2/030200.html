&gt; The cooling boot for the 55amp alt. is part # 021 903 655. It is still in 
&gt; production and available through a variety of sources. The part # for the 
&gt; 70amp alt is 022 903 655. It is NLA. Kaput. Gonersville. The pully/fan assy. 
&gt; for the 70 amp alt is part # 022 903 109. It too has gone the way of the 
&gt; Dodo. I called Bosch of America today to ask about the chances of finding 
&gt; either of these two components. I was politely told to get stuffed. Moral of 
&gt; the story: If you've got the 70 amp alt, and the boot, treat it like it was 
&gt; made of gold, cause there ain't no more to be had. Pity really, as the 70 amp 
&gt; alt can easily be built to 90 amps by any competent rebuilder, and if you've 
&gt; upgraded any of the electrical components in your bus i.e.: CDI ign, 
&gt; inverter, H-4 lighting, stereo, etc., you already know that the 55 amp alt is 
&gt; marginal at best.

55 is marginal?!  55A is 660W at 12V, more than enough to run the engine,
the lights, and the stereo turned up to Full Pain.  Bug generators only
put out 30A and they're just fine.  I'm in the process of upgrading my '71
to a type1 alternator of 52 amps, not because the 38A generator is
inadequate, but because I want the better reliability and quieter
operation (in RF terms) of the alternator.  I run H4 headlights and a 100W
ham radio transmitter and the 38A unit worked fine until it wore out.  30
years of use will do that!
