Subject: Noah car cover for Westy
To: type2_at_type2_dot_com

I am going to have to leave my Westy outside this winter, unfortunantly (as 
the Mustang project gets into full swing, the garage space it takes up 
multiplies like a couple of (blank)-happy rabbits.)
Anyway, I just can't bear to leave it out unprotected.  I've looked over the 
archives, and seen the pros and cons of covers, but I still want to ask...
Does anyone have an Evolution 4 or Noah cover for their Westy?  They are 
supposed to be the best, but I'm still concerned.  Do they actually 'breath' 
like they are suppposed to?  Are they suitable for use in windy/rainy/snowy 
areas (like West Virginia)?
If anyone out there has a cover like this I'd appreciate hearing what you 
think of it.  And will a regular '78 Type 2 transporter cover fit my Westy, 
or will I need to buy a larger cover?  Lastly, anybody find a source for 
these cheap?
Much thanks,
Greg
