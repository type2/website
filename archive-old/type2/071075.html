Subject: Re: [T2] Rear shocks

Hey all, I emailed the original sender in Germany this message, but I thought 
I'd pass it along to the rest of the List. Air shocks that were designed for 
the '85-'92 Chevy Astro work. You do need a 15mm longer top tower bolt, 
however. The whole kit is available at NAPA for around 90.00 bucks. It works 
well, I've run them on my own busses for over 60k miles without a problem. 
And for all of you DM followers, keep this in mind. VW listed coil-over 
shocks, and air-shocks as original equipment on several of their delivery and 
fire fighting type 2 variants.
