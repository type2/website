&gt; &gt;&gt; vacuum and get everything clean, but the stuff just has no where else to

&gt; Sorry to offend anyone.  It really was mostly a joke.  The outside of my

&gt; the mess. 

Hey, if it works, don't appologize.

Tim and I bought a van (years ago), and he ended up driving it for the 
next 10 years w/o doing much to it that looked like much. He always had 
the idea of fixing it up, but it took that long to get the running gear 
and interior looking good. By this time, all the interior had been 
replaced, along with the running gear. One weekend, we decided to fix 
the exterior of the rig.

We rolled it into the shop and did a complete repaint. It looked so good 
that we pulled all the mats, and gave the inside a complete redo. When 
done, the van looked nearly new.

A couple weeks later, he was parked down on campus. He had taken to 
locking the van for some reason. He came out this afternoon, and found 
that someone had smashed out 2 windows, in the driver's door and side 
door. They stole the tail light lenses, headlamp rings, turn signal 
lenses, and the front passenger seat (in back)... all while it was 
parked on a street where hundreds of people pass by every day. These 
were the same parts he'd had for several years BEFORE the van looked 
good.

Ugly is not a bad defense... even when the scum-thieves are VW owners.
