&gt; &gt;Has anyone ever really understood the effectiveness of the &quot;intake
air
&gt; &gt;preheating hose &quot; which goes through the tin and sucks dusty,
cruddy air from
&gt; &gt;below the engine compartment, right where the back wheels kick up
all the
&gt; &gt;dirt.

It is quite effective on my '71!

First, you can rest your mind concerning the ingestion of dirty air,
provided that all the parts are present.  The hot air riser takes air
&gt;from a location very near the rear fins of the #2 cylinder.  This is
air that, until a moment previously, was in the upper engine bay, the
same as &quot;normal&quot; intake air.  If the duct is in place the air will be
clean!

I notice that my '71 has much better drivability when the temps get
down into the 40s and below if the hot intake air tube is hooked up. 
The thermostratic air valve on the aircleaner is kaput, so I
disconnected it and now just open the valve for winter and close it
for summer.  Seems to work fine that way and some other makes of cars
work that way from the factory.
