Subject: 71 bus clutch operating shaft

hello,
     I have been a lurker on the list for about two
years. I am having trouble finding a part. It is the
forked shaft that works as a release bar for the
clutch on my 71 bus. The part number is 002 141 701A.
does anybody know someone who has this part, or shops
that have it. Thanks in advance for any help

                 Chris
