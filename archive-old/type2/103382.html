Subject: re: [T2] Wood interior for the Westy - long, sorry

Hi, Jerry , ,

Two items: Acetone  and  Neoprene Gloves.

And a bunch of absorbent rags/paper towels, a wide scraper, and loving 
attention.

I have a '78 that had the 'laminate' covering on the interior (notice the 
terms 'have' and 'had').  This laminate is a vinyl covering with the color 
and grain printed on it..  Over time and with the heat the wood suffers, the 
vinyl covering puckers, and also shrinks ever so slightly.  The vinyl will 
even split.

The '77 Westys and earlier generally had the solid plywood,  sans vinyl.  
These panels were, like, stained and finished with a grain and then covered 
with a urethane-type finish.

I collected a full set of panels from various pre-'78 Westys and refinished 
the panels by stripping the heavy urethane cover with acetone and rags.  I 
did not use the scraper.  Reason: many parts of the panels were discolored 
or had the original finish cracked off and the bare wood exposed.  By just 
smearing the original finish with Acetone and rags, I got an even 
color/stain throughout the individual panels.  The original stain was evenly 
spread over the individual panels.  After the panels were dry, I brushed on 
some satin clear polyurethane.


I first tried one panel, the rear hatch panel.  The '77 donor panel was a 
mess, but I wanted to preserve my original, primo '78 vinyl rear hatch 
panel, and I also wanted to  &gt;&gt;&gt;  install a pull ring to open the '78 rear 
hatch from the inside. &lt;&lt;&lt;    So, my original intention was NOT to refinish 
my interior, but to save my original '78 vinyl rear hatch panel.

(You have to drill a hole in the rear hatch panel to fit a cotter pin thru 
the panel to the lock mechanism.  Then fit a 'key ring' to the exposed eye 
of the cotter pin that is now popping out of the hole at the surface of the 
rear hatch panel.    Pull the 'key ring' to open the rear hatch from the 
inside, even if the rear hatch is locked with a key.  But be careful you 
don't go out that way, close the hatch from the outside and wind up locking 
yourself out of the Westy/bus!!

Also, a good idea is to add one of those 'assist straps' to the center of 
the rear hatch panel just below the rear window, with two screws [and more 
holes]  into the wood panel + top screw goes thru the wood into the metal 
part of the rear hatch.  Then you can hold the rear hatch from flying up 
after it is opened from the inside.  And you can grab the  'assist strap' 
from the inside of the Westy to pull the hatch closed.  Just one more way to 
exit the Westy when camping at night.  Much quieter than the sliding door 
and QUICKER[if you know what I mean] than the front doors.  The 'key ring' 
is hidden by the rear cushion so most people/kids won't accidentally 
activate the rear door opener, and the 'key ring' can be removed in less 
than a minute if you are going to put curious tots back there as a play area 
when you are camped.)  &lt;&lt;-- This is called a FART, BTW !!

The job came out very, very excellent!!!  After a few months of looking at 
the refinished rear hatch panel, I thought I would have a go at doing the 
full Westy with refinished replacement panels.  I did, and everything came 
out fine.

Yes, the grain pattern from the pre-'78 panels is NOT there any more, but I 
have a natural wood look to the whole Westy, not (in my humble opinion) some 
cheap looking, photo grain on vinyl.  (I did use one panel ( sliding door ) 
from a '78 hardtop camper.  It was the wood type.  I looked for over a year 
for this last panel, and found it in the very FIRST Westy I ever came across 
in a junk yard.  It was dirty and cruddy and bleached and buckled from the 
weather.  And it was in a '78, so I dissed it entirely.   But it came out 
super!!.  Yes, some '78 Westy may have the non-vinyl wood panels.)


I now have a '72 that I am working with.  This has the white birch finish 
inside.  I will strip the whole '72 Westy, this time using the current 
panels, and re-stain it with Pickled Oak - 
http://www.minwax_dot_com/produse/stains/puwswf3.htm

It will not be original, and I am sure I will lose some of the 'grain', but 
this is a necessity.  My rear hatch panel on the '72 suffered some heavy 
water stain damage, and I stripped it down already using the acetone.  The 
overhead panels have dried and have flaked the heavy finish off already.  
Some of the side panels have cracking and chipping of the finish.  I can 
actually see the physical surface difference between the wood, and the 
original caked on finish.  And I want to do some panel additions, so I will 
need to get a single stain across the whole Westy.


One more hint:

As you use the acetone rags to smear the finish over the panel's bad spots, 
you will see that this works real well.  But if you have a panel that does 
not have enough recoverable stain to cover all the bad spots on the panel, 
you will get anxious real fast!!  &quot;What, not enough stain to cover the 
panel!!!&quot;   If you come up against that condition, you may want to have 
another panel with a lot of stain available to leach some of the stain off 
of it for the slighted panel.  The scraper comes in handy.

So I am suggesting that you do the stripping all in one afternoon, by 
placing ALL of the panels flat on your garage floor and having a go at it 
all at once.  It really does go fast.

You can buy a small can of acetone and try to stretch it, or, if you believe 
my experience, you could invest in the gallon size so you have enough, for 
sure.  You will find tons of uses for it.

(Acetone dries very fast.  And make sure you have those purple neoprene 
gloves, not the cheap latex gloves.  Spent the extra pennies to enjoy your 
project.)

Good luck
