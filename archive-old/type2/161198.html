Subject: bus rescue in South Carolina

 There is a fabulous looking green westy on alt rte. 17 between Summerville and Monck's Corner in southern South Carolina.  It's just sitting in the &quot;back lot&quot; of one of those shady used car dealerships we have so many of.   It looks like it's in really great condition, but I'm assuming the dealer got it in a truckload with a bunch of other cars and didn't know the value of a VW and threw it out back in case someone wanteds it for parts.  I only saw it yesterday going by at 45 mph, but I'm going back to get a better look and find out more.  I can't adopt another bus right now (my 78 bay is a handful and my ghia is quite spoiled and gets jealous easily)but I'd hate to see this one go to the rust gods, especially because it looks like it's in good condition.  Is there anyone down here who needs another?  I'll find out more for you if you do.
 
Emma
