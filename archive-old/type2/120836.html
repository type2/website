Subject: Re: [T2] Buying Clutch Overhaul Parts Ahead of Time?

Hello Guys   the pressure plates and TOB both changed in 1971.  The early 
ones don't have the slevve the TOB rides on and are more likely to come off the 
crosshaft. On the early style I use the super clips that have a circle on the 
ends and litely wire tye them to the crosshaft. This way they can't fall off 
and destroy your pressure plate and crosshaft. The only way to be sure of which 
type you have is to remove them. Later and have fun  Mark Dearing  Salem
