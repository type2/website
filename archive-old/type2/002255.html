I was in Albuquerque, NM last week (and missed the bus get-together,
damnit).  In one of the junk yards out there I saw a loaf bus with the upper
portion of bug (from about 2 inches below the windows) welded to the top of
it.  .....

I haven't seen this specifically, but while I was travelling with the Grateful Dead in the early '90s, I traveled wth a guy who had a school bus with 2 bay windows welded to the top end to end.  Each Baywindow slept 4 and was jsut very cool to see driving down the road.
Somebody else mentioned the cross-wind factor.... that could definitely keep you on your toes!
