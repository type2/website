&gt; Your problem sounds very electrical to me.  A loose connection, on the

&gt; problems are by far the *worst* kind, and it sounds like you have one :-(
&gt; I would (a) remove, replace and wiggle all the electrical connectors on
&gt; the ignition and FI wiring harnesses.  If any look like they have any
&gt; significant corrosion, I would brighten them with some 600 or 800 grit
&gt; wet/dry sandpaper.  (b) check the dwell at 800-2500 RPM.  If it is
&gt; &quot;bouncy&quot; the spring on your points may be going.  I will bet all your
&gt; components are fine, but that they may not be connected correctly all the

one other thing to check while the connectors are apart.  look inside the
female side of the plug, occasionally the metal part will get pushed back
inside the connector and while the connector is pushed together tight the
actual electrical connection is not pushed together

ask me how long it took to find that out!?!?
