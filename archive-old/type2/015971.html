&gt;I will have to back up this statement, I had some genuine VW originals and
&gt;could never get them to stop leaking, dang things drove me to drink.  got
&gt;some of the Vitron seals (not even from Ron) and haven't had any leaking

Same experience!  Even the VW dealership could not get their own rings to
stop leaking.  Even after installing new rings, I would still leak a quart
of oil every 1000 miles.  After I installed the Vitron seals, only very
minor leaking problems.
