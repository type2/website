Allen,

Subject: [T2] Experiences with Auto Trans?

I have an 79 westy automatic, possibly quite
similar to the 81.

I like it. Especially when returning from a
trip from WI and having to sit in stop and go
traffic
on the I90 or 41. But if you can hold out for a
4 speed, do it.

I paid 4500 for mine. It was in
excellent shape. I think put another 2000 into it.
Hey, anything's better than a $35,000 new one
that'll
sit in the driveway most of the time.

PS. Any recommendations from the audience on real
good ATF
fluid? I like to drive around 70-75 mph and I just
wanted
to make sure it runs the best.
