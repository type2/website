sure.  I presume you mean the 72-75?/79-83(non cat) one.

For a product of Denmark, i have not much complaint.  the tail pipe is
brazilian.


I would advise you to be wary of the studs on the flanges, though.

When removing the nuts (which are PAINTED ON!), 4 studs came out, so i had
to double-nut to get the painted nut off, then doublenut to put back in.
Made sure the others were tight also.

100 miles later &gt; I almost bought a Empi Exhaust system for the 72 engine I'm in the
&gt; process of building, then I read the archives, Looks like I saved

20-30 minutes of engine-time later, we had to pull the exhaust to fix a
nasty leak at the oil filler flange. (and find that we had a cracked
head...but that is a different story!:)

Note that when installed .none. of the bolts went on tight (ie, not
crossthreaded). But taking it off, two of the studs broke off flush at the
flange.

this required drilling and tapping for new studs...

just FYI.

later...david
