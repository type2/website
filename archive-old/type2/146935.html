Subject: Re: [T2] Engine removal

For a type 1 on the cheap, I did the following successfully many times 
back in 1974 when trying to located an oil leak (was crack in case 
behind flywheel)...... Find some blacktop (I used our local car wash 
place.  Get 2 scissors jacks, 3 pieces of broom handle about 2 ft long, 
and a plywood board 3/4&quot; thick wide enough to span UNDER the heater 
boxes AND a sledge hammer.  Also have on hand something to hold the 
tranny in place; I used a concrete block and board shims.   Drive the 
rear of the bus up onto a ramp made from nailing together 3-4 pieces of 
2x6 boards.  You could also jackstand  the rear axles by jacking up eack 
side in the rear under the shock mounts.
      After doing most of what you need by lying under the bus (lower 
tranny to engine nuts, disconnect cables, etc.)  place the board under 
the engine on top of the broom handles.  Stand the scissor jacks on this 
and crank up to contact on either side of sump screen plate.
    Now do the disconnect stuff in the engine compartment, including the 
engine cross bar.  Lower the engine enough to LEVEL it to the street and 
contact the trans onto its support- I adjusted its height with 2x4 hunks 
on it.  Yes you could do the VW thing with a chain under the tranny. 
The lowering trick I did with BOTH hands on the jack handles.
Now you can reach behind the engine to do the upper case nuts with your 
long box wrench.  A short handled sledge is good for persuading the wrench.
    As the engine is parallel to the ground, you can &quot;easily&quot; roll it 
backwards by yanking the sides of the intake manifolds and rocking. A 
friend can also tap on the board to help; when I did this I nailed 
pieces of slatting around the scissor jacks to keep their place on the 
board.  Remember it is critical to have the input shaft parallel to the 
clutch and not binding on it.
    Once free of the input shaft, lower the engine fully and roll it all 
backwards on the broomhandles.  Reinstall in an opposite manner, using 
the sledge to tap on the edges of the board for alignment, as you lie 
underneath to check input shaft centering.  It will roll in on the 
broomhandles if you always add one in the front as you go.
Considering how many times I did this, I could have the engine out in 15 
min.........
