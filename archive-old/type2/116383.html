Subject: [T2] T2 - 1982 Vanagon 1588cc Air Cooled - Air Filter System -
  a  final call  to arms

Hi There

Many thanks to Tim Doktor on his fairly thorough reply.  However I am still
unsure about the science of air flow, air / fuel mix and carburretors,
especially with the set up I have.  From the air housing via a temperature
regulator I have a direct link to the inlet manifold and a direct link to
the air housing's vacuum unit.  That is it with vacuum hose directly from
the air housing.  I therefore have no direct link from the air housing to
the carb', which I should have.  There is a connection from the air housing
(via a temperature switch) to a control valve on the fuel oulet side of the
solex carb'.  This control valve is not on my carb' for whatever reason!

There is also the small matter of the vacuum hose from the throttle damper
to the carb' not having a delay valve (if this is indeed, a small matter).
Can I do without this delay valve or can I devise my own invention.  As I
say the engine sounds fine but I am sure that my set up, which detracts
considerably from the set up shown in the Haynes manual, (pg 63) will result
in poor efficiency.  Can anyone shed more light?

Confused

Richard
