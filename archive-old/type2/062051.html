Subject: Re: Query re timing 78 distributor

Michael,

I have the same problem on my '75 and have been scratching my head for 
a while. My latest theory is that the two teeth at the bottom tip of 
the distributor shaft are worn and don't fit snuggly into the thingy 
inside the engine block. The small amount of play is probably on the 
order of 15 degrees. As I said, it's just a theory and I'm not sure 
why this wouldn't lead to erratic readings at idle as well.

I'd be curious to hear whether other listmembers have similar play on 
their 20 year old vehicles.

Sami
