Hello all!
I did something yesterday that I hope won't get me banned from the Bus li=
st...I bought a 2002 Beetle. New. Five Speed, with manual windows!
I know what a lot of folks think...But inside there are a lot of visual c=
lues to the old Beetle...
My very first car was a 1968 White Beatle...a Semi-Automatic...And I have=
 owned 11 various VW's...And it allowed me to trade in my Ford Out Of Foc=
us (two, yes two, fuel pumps in less then two months, and the car had onl=
y 43,000 miles on it!)

TJ, who loves his 1978 Bus and now has a 2002 Beetle. Get more from the W=
