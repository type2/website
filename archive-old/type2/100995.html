Subject: Re:Pushrod tube leak

HI Jay,
	One (another?) thing to be anal about is to get all the old
sealers/dirt/oil residue out of the case and head sealing areas.  I went
over my tube o-ring grooves with a wire brush then clean, clean, clean
with a rag, popsicle stick and carb cleaner.  On the case and heads I went
around with carb cleaner and cloth on a stick until they gleamed.  Get
your head up in there and use a good light (a mirror helps). Then and only
then did I put the tube in with engine oil coating the o-rings to ensure
they do not get pinched.  I had seen it recommended to chamfer the entry
on both the cases and heads.  Mine had had that done.  This reduces the
chance of cutting the o-rings.  If you get the sealing areas clean you
will not need to gum up the works by using a sealer, a generally bad idea
in this application. Viton seals, as recommended by other posters are the
way to go.  Should be dry as a bone after that.
