Subject: Re: [T2] Need help with possible engine purchase

Right. I found this page when I was trying to find the right head for the 
other Porsche motor that lunched out on me the other week. This one is code 
W, so as the chart shows, it's 80 horse with 66mm stroke. I also noticed the 
CR is 8.2:1, and I read somewhere, if not on your site, that these early 
high compression motors can't run on US gas, not even premium. Is that 
right? Also, what's horsepower on bus T4's?

&gt; I'm still looking for good torque numbers. The gearbox was different and 
&gt; the body was 1200 lbs. lighter so they could favor HP over torque. It's 
&gt; had to compare HP values when the 2L bus was measured at 4200rpm and the 
&gt; 914's much higher. Here are some of the specs:
