Eddie, You said bolt, I assume this is a double ended stud with one left
hand thread. In that case if the threads are intact, then you might be able
to get it back in this way.... Get 2 head nuds and put them on the top of
the stud together. then with 2 spanners hold the lower one and tighten the
topone. They bind together real tight. put the stud in and do it up using
the top nut to tension and use 2 spanners to separate the nuts, if there is
not enough exposed thread to use the 2 nuts you can cut one(or both) down
until its (they are) quite thin and it will all still work.

&gt; ..went to retourque the heads today and noticed that the lower right
&gt; stud on #2 was very loose....went to tighten but turning the bolt only
&gt; threaded the stud out of the case...along with little metal
&gt; filings....D'OH!!! The engine (1600DP Type 3) does not have case savers
&gt; installed. My question #1 is: what are my options? Should I install a case
&gt; saver on this stud, or get a bigger &quot;self-tapping&quot; stud? Question #2, do I
&gt; Have to tear the engine down to install the case saver?
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Thanks,
&gt; Eddie
