 The next things I would check would be the vacuum lines (especially if you
 have one running to the back of the intake manifold) and the exhaust
 gaskets. Does it backfire when you back off the throttle? If so then its the
 exhaust.
 
 It does not backfire, idles pretty well. Timing is right (about 7 deg BTDC).
 
 Since there are no vacuum lines at all, and since the rough running is
 mostly
 above 35 mph, I'll next swap out the distributor and plug wires. If that
 doesn't
 solve it, I'll check the intake manifold for leaks. Other ideas?

I just did some work on my 71 bus and in the process stopped some vacuum 
leaks, most notaby the boot on the right side of the intake maniforl that was 
cracked underneath and out of sight.  I had to reset the carb adjustment to 
get my rough runner back into battery.  Runs smooth now.
