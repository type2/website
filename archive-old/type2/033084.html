Subject: Re: Engine Number

&gt; 1. Could someone please decipher what year engine I have. The number is
&gt; CB056530.
Dunno on that one.

&gt; 2. On the back of the mounting stand their is a place for the brake
booster
&gt; line, mine is currently under the bus not hooked up. Should I hook this
&gt; brake booster line back up?

Yes. I have the same setup. Mine works fine.

&gt; 3. No auto choke power line has been left, I have found two cut lines that
&gt; run with the bundle cable to the coil. Since my engine should have
&gt; originally had two carbs would these more than likely be the auto choke
&gt; power? Following the wiring diagram it seams to be.

Yep. I have a wire going from the choke to the + side of the coil.

&gt; 4. I had a hard time finding a local FLAPS that had spark plug wires, I
did
&gt; find a set for $30.00 does that sound right, expensive. The lines didn't
&gt; match perfect to the ones I took off but didn't know if this would be a
&gt; problem. Will this cause any problems?

Probably won't. My cables are clearly not the same as OE but they work just
fine.

&gt; Thanks to any and all that can help.

That's what were here for.
