Subject: need engine number info

I've looked on various vw web pages but haven't found a list of engine numbers
and their relative paticulars.

I have a 1956 Single cab with chassis number 163319, the engine in it
presently has the following number on it D128023X Can anyone give me any info
as to what year and vehicle this motor belongs to if not original to this
truck? Many thanks - Tim in Minneapolis.
