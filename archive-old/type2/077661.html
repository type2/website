Subject: Re: [T2] another emissions question

question..........I stopped the other day to look at a bus
72-76?maybe...sitting on the back of a car lot. The guy wanted $350.
bucks for it...motor was locked up and it was a little ruff...but it had
a smog pump on it and duel stock carbs.......are the smog pumps sought
after and at what value?  I feel the pump and carbs are worth the price
of the van....?/
          scott in high point
