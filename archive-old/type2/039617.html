Subject: Spare cover/sink

List,
First of all, it feels good to not be asking engine parts related questions
anymore, as i am 100 miles or so into my break-in.
Feels good.

Q:

I've seen front spare covers with a big &quot;VW&quot; on them - are people just
painting this on or can i get one somewhere?

Second, there is pressure in my left rocker box (i can hear it seeping out
when i kill the engine- hsssssss...) is this a valve guide giving blow-by?
Should i just vent it like the dragsters do and not worry about it?

Tertiarily (oooh! big word), might someone have a sink - just the sink - out
of a std westy they'd wanna prt with?  Its the one that goes in the sink cab
that sits behind the driver and faces the sliding door in maybe 73-76 std (not
deluxe - no stove) campers. I just want it there for looks - don't need the
tank or anything.

Enjoying my bus, enjoying the weather,

clark in Ky.
