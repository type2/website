Subject: RE: exhaust wrap

I think the wrap is mainly intended to be used on the header/manifold, which
you will probably not be able to get in SS for the type 2 unless you are not
using heat exchangers.  Not saying that you wouldn't get any advantage in
using it on the muffler/silencer, just that this is not the intended
application so the advantage would be limited.

&gt; I'm thinking that this kind of thermal wrap might go very well with a
&gt; Stainless Steel exhaust.
