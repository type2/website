&gt; I did mine this week and I took the bus to a guy with a lift. I kept

&gt; All the bolts were mucked up and had to be cleaned to get them out.

Ric, Luis:
Yeah, a LIFT, what a concept! I worked at a shop when I was 16 that had 3!!
(That was 35 years ago and there WERE NO CV JOINTS on Vw's in 1966!) I've
changed a lot of them lying on the ground in the meantime.
Ric touched on something very important: Clean out the sockets of the socket
head screws. I use a baby straight blade screwdriver. dig it out till it comes
out clean. Next, use a 6mm allen (or corresponding correct size triple square)
Snap-on or mac or Matco Quality 3/8 adapter and an air impact wrench. This is
one place where an air impact (and the right allen adapter) is PRICELESS. You
don't ever want to find out how much trouble it is to get one of these bolts out
if you round out the  socket head screw. Cutting torch time!! Even worse on the
outers of a Vanagon because it's inside the trailing arm.
I will add, that if they start making noise, and you're no where near a place to
fix them, I've cut a small incision in the boot and lubed them with spray grease
and bought over 20,000 miles. I change the boots always when I re-lube them
anyway, so the incision is not a big deal to me. Might feel differently if I was
in the desert in the midst of a lot of sand.
