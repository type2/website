Subject: VR brand?

I had a Wells voltage regulator and it crapped out after 3 years.  It
appeared to be of the same mechanical design as the Bosch.  (Is there a
solid state one y'all are referring to?)  I also had a Bosch and it crapped
out after 2 years.  I have had other generator issues (such as an Autozone
reman that made fireworks) so I have been hard on the VR's in general.  But
I prefer to stay with the stock Bosch.  YMMV.

I was shocked by the hostility of the recent response--I actually like to
read Herr Doktor's pontifications even though I don't always follow the
Deutche Methode myself.  It is still good to know what is proper and spec
even if I choose to cut corners, maybe I can do it right next time.  And
acknowledging the other side, there are certainly ways to make upgrades from
stock, although the more I learn, the more I see that you can rarely beat
stock for cost per mile.  Who knows, maybe VR's are an example of that, if
so then I would like to see a link to the special one.  But I would rather
not see public personal flames like that--them's fightin' words so please
take it outside.

Looking forward to Everybus my first real bus gathering.  Doh, pinched the
accel cable in the bellhousing during my engine install.  That's a new one!
Try, try again.
