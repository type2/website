Subject: Re: [T2] Diesel bay?



  I would take a trip south of the border and pick up a Mexican exterior
radiator mount and cowl that go on the front of the bus.

Excellent idea, but remember the nose panel of the Mexican Bus is indented
several inches for the radiator to sit inside, thusly the radiator cowl is
almost flush with the front.
