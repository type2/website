Subject: RE: [T2] Any experience or thoughts with the CB filter?  

  I have had one on my wifes bug (65 with new Mexi engine) for 3 years now
and also had one on my 62 panel 1776. I think they work great. When changing
the oil in either of these VW's I am amazzed at how much crap they really do
catch compared to the stock screen. Goes to show how much crap really gets
through your engine. My 1776 had over 60,000 when sold and my wifes bug has
close to 10,000 miles on it. I never had a problem with either.
  Every VW type 1 based engine I own (and I have a lot) either has a sump
filter or a filter pump, as does every engine I build.

ronnie   you only learn from trying
