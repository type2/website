&lt;&lt;   First, the general school of thought here on
 the list says, for Type 4 engine, .006&quot; for intake valves, .008&quot; for
 exhaust valves.   &gt;&gt;

Wellll.... mebbe.

The eight-thou spec was for sodium-filled valves.  Ask the typical bus owner
if they've got sodium-filled valves you get a blank look.  So you shrug and
tell them to use eight thou.  Can't hurt.  Much.
