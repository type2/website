&gt;  Can anyone tell me where the reversing light switch is?  I have found 
&gt; loose
&gt;  wires in the engine bay, the third wire coming off the coil ( no fuse) but
&gt;  can't find switch on the transmission housing.

&gt;  everything but this one!

Hi Steve,

It's quite possible that you don't have one... 
The reversing light switches were optional extras in the UK (fitted to all USA
busses so they will tell you that you must have one)
The presence of some wiring may well indicate that the gearbox has been
changed at some time.

Any way the location of the switch on the '73 gearbox I have down stairs is at
the front of the gear box (infact its on the nose cone) on the left side (as
fitted in bus) and about 1/2 way up the height of the Box. If you go any
further forward then you are off the end of the gearbox.

If you don't have one then there will be a screw in blanking plate which you
need an alan key to remove. These switches are easily available I think the
one I fitted about 4 or 5 years back cost around £2.50 (UK pounds) from German
and Swedish.

&quot;Correct&quot; wiring should be from + side of coil through fuse to switch then
back to lights.

Good luck
