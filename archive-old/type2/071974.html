Subject: Re: CA Air-cooled Vanagon Deck Height
Cc: type2_at_type2_dot_com

&gt;Regarding the deck height on the 2.0 Vanagon, I recently put new pistons
&gt;and cylinders on what appears to be an previously unmachined case and
&gt;stock crank and had a deck height in the 0.035&quot; range. I had planned to
&gt;leave the gaskets out at the cylinder bases, but with a deck height of
&gt;only 0.025&quot; with this configuration, I thought better to include them and
&gt;bump it up to 0.034 to 0.035&quot;.   Wilson mentions 0.040&quot; being the
&gt;minimum, but then again there is several comments that do to apply to
&gt;Type IV's especially late Type IV's (oil baffles, bolting in oil pick-up
&gt;tube, etc).
&gt;
&gt;I searched the Bently and Haynes manuals, but no mention of deck height.
&gt;I called the VW shop that put my crank together (30 years with an
&gt;unlisted tel no. - they must be pretty good!) and when I told him I had
&gt;0.035&quot;, he said &quot;Your there now you can have a beer!&quot; So based on the
&gt;opinion of one, 0.035&quot; seems fine, but
&gt;
&gt; **Does Anyone Have a Factory Deck Height Specification For a Vanagon
&gt;2.0?***

I don't have the factory specs, but I can tell you that the Vanagon engine
I took apart had about the same deck height - I measured it at .030&quot;.  I
was also concerned that this was not enough after reading Wilson's book,
and ended up putting .060&quot; spacers under the jugs to bring my deck height
up to .090&quot;.  With my roughly 51cc heads, this gave me 6.8 to 1
compression.  After a while I removed the .060&quot; spacers and replaced them
with .030&quot; (deck height .060&quot;) for about 7.0 to 1 compression and felt a
slight increase in power.  I was going to remove the .030&quot; spacers and run
with just the .030&quot; deck height but I got some new heads with smaller
chambers so I think I will end up leaving the spacers there.  I guess what
I'm trying to say is that I think there is adequate clearance to run with
.030&quot; deck height as long as you are running the stock cam, rockers, and
valves.  There, now you have two opinions.
