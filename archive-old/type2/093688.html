Objet : [T2] AFC injection problem


Fuel pressure is in spec, valve lash correct, timing dead on, and is =
correct
throughout the range.

Tuned up my van the other day, found my timing to be a little too
advanced........the van WAS running fine, great mph, temps in spec, =
etc.,
but set it back to Bentley manual specs.  7.5 BTDC at idle, right =
around 40
total advance.

Auxiliary air reg is fine........tested in refrigerator and watched it =
warm
up and close..........

When I start the van, cold engine, the idle is around 400rpm.  The
adjustment screw on the throttle body is almost all the way out to =
achieve
this.........If i crank this screw inward, the van will die.  After =
about 5
minutes of driving, the idle is around 800 and all is well, except one =
thing

When I pull off from a stop light, or stop.I have no power at all.once =
the
rpms go over 2000 it starts pulling real good......I had a stop light =
at the
base of a steep hill....I had to roll back and get a run to get up it!  =


My head temp sensor is a year old, but plan on changing =
that........Does not
appear to be any vac leaks....went around the running engine and tested =
with
brake clean



Any ideas form those that have seen this would be appreciated.
