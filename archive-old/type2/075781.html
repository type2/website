Subject: Re: [T2] Bug motor into Bus

......I went with someone to tow a 69 bus once without a engine and had the
same problem. We ended up using some rope tied around the tranny to a  sign
pole wedged and tied up in the engine compartment.  This worked from Upstate
NewYork To the CT
/RI border shoreline. I just kept on thinking &quot;it's not my bus&quot;.

&gt; &gt; Well I picked up my bus. 22 hour round trip adventure to Delaware. (NOTE
&gt; &gt; - when towing 70 bus w/o motor; remember to plan on supporting tranny or
&gt; &gt; waste 3 hours in strange town looking for a way to rig it up) more about
&gt; &gt; that when I finish my web page.
&gt;
&gt; It takes twenty to thirty minutes (if the CV bolt gods are smiling on you
&gt; this day) to remove the transmission and stick it in the cargo area.
