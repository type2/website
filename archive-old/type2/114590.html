Well, the 243,000 never rebuilt Westy made it from NJ to Transporters by the
Tunnel and back- with an oil pressure of 12 when it got to 250
degr....normally I get 18 at 220, but it was a hot day......the 40 wt oil
went in.

Faster, Mike, faster...Irv Gordon's 1966 Volvo 1800S went 680,000 before it
was rebuilt...Total mileage so far is 1,800,000...
