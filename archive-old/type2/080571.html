Subject: Engine dolly plan is now available as a .pdf file

I'm not particularly for it or against it, but the engine dolly plan is now
available direct from me as a .pdf file.  If you haven't got the Acrobat
reader for that, I know it's freeware from the adobe site
(http://www.adobe_dot_com I think).  Print it off on your own printer and away
you go.

Anyone else who wants one but isn't interested in that degree of trouble can
send me their postal address and I'll mail you one (freebie, my little gift
back for all the help), or get it from the archives.

If the CAD guys want to distribute it from their site, I'll send it there,
too.  Their call.
