Subject: RE: [T2] Don't scrap your Buses!

 
--Well I for one think that Bustedbus is already doing this, and is sort of geographically central. Besides, they have taken the initiative and should be supported, as they are supporting us. 

I think we as a community should make attempts to get the goner buses, or as many parts there of to them.

Billy 

&gt;With all the talk of trying to save our buses, how hard would it be &gt;for local clubs to organize Co-op type salvage yards. How much red &gt;tape would be involved with such an operation?
