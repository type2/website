Subject: Re: [T2] starting fluid



From: &quot;Terry K.&quot;
&gt; Automatic ether injection set-ups are available as an option, on all
&gt; diesel engine's----as a cold start package, from all truck mfg's.
&gt; ( Mack. Freightliner, Pete, KW, Volvo/GMC, Ford, Sterling, Hendrickson,
&gt; FWD, Navistar,Western Star, Oshgosh )

We don't use starting fluid on any Mercedes car diesels. The engine won't
start if we do. The starting fluid washes the oil off the walls and rings and
compression goes by-by. You can hear the cranking speed double!. If we get one
towed-in that has had starting fluid sprayed in it, we have squirt a light oil
in it, i.e. ATF, to get the compression back up.
