OK, I'll bite.

It would appear that things aren't going your way.  Your best bet if you
want to keep this van, is to take the time and learn to work on it yourself
IMHO.  Its costing you a lot of time already.  If you do this, you will
have more confidence in your machine and you will have a lot better feel
for where it is mechanically.  Now I understand that this is not for
everyone, so I will try to answer each of your questions and you can form
your own opinion.

&gt;How many miles should I expect from a 2L Type IV?
I got 135,000 miles on my '79 before I rebuilt it

&gt;Could I retrofit a Vanagon engine in my Type 2?
Yes and maybe.  Vanagons up until '83 used the same aircooled Type IV.
After 83 they were watercooled, so significant modifications would likely
be necessary.  Would be a lot easier to just buy a watercooled westy.

&gt;Would the Vanagon engine be an improvement?
The watercooleds do seem to have more power, but they have their own set of
idiosyncracies.  The aircooleds are the same as what you've got.

&gt;How about installing an american V6 (or similar)?
If you aren't doing your own maintenance now, you almost certainly would if
you went this route.  No mechanic is going to want to mess with it.
Conversion would be a major undertaking.

&gt;Can I get an engine that can maintain the speed limit going uphill?
Sure.

&gt;How reliable is the Vanagon compared to a Type 2?
To paint with the broad brush here; newer cars are generally more reliable
than older cars, simply due to improvements in automotive technology and
the fact that they are newer.  My '79 FI westy with pointless ignition is
pretty damn reliable though.

&gt;What is going to be the most cost effective solution?
big ole beautiful 1965 F**d Galaxy 500 automatic.  Seriously, I think the
most cost effective solution would be to learn to do your own maintenance
and repairs.  You have access to this list which is your best resource.
Every problem you've experienced has likely been addressed before by a
listmember.

&gt;Does anyone want to buy an ASI camper van with a very clean (99%
rust free) body?
How much, where you at, what year, condition  etc. etc. etc.
