&lt;&lt; and those ceramic 12V heaters...there was one in the bus I picked up
 tonight.  absolute junk.  waste of space.  I could barely tell a
 difference between the outside air and the &quot;heat&quot; out of that thing. &gt;&gt;

Living in the colder section of the world I would expect gas heaters to be 
the rage.  My experience tells me that gas heaters work great!  I have seen 
them in an old Buick and a Corvair and they put out so much heat that within 
five minutes you had to turn the heat down.  Does anyone out there have 
experience with a gas heater in a Type II?

P.S. The gas heater experience was in colder climates.
