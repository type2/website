Subject: ba6 selling value

greetings-

I have a BA6 heater and fuel pump, and dash switch.
 
How much could I reasonably expect to fetch for these on
the open market? I'm short quite a few of the parts needed to
make a real working system, but the heater body itself, as well
as fuel pump and switch are in excellent condition. I need to reclaim
the space they are taking, as well as convert some possessions back
into currency.

thanks for your suggestions

matt
