&gt;Hi again, it's Mick,
&gt;I'm persevering with the Michelin Classics, 185 R14 C, - 8 ply (1875 lbs.)
&gt;vs. 6 ply (1540 lbs.).
&gt;Michelin need the individual  axle weights front and rear to give accurate
&gt;pressure recommendations.
&gt;It weighed 1.34 tonne total.
&gt;Does anyone have even a rough idea of the individual axle weights so I can
&gt;at least start running at more realistic tyre pressures ?

Roughly 60/40 rear to front. That would be 1.34 x .6 / 2 for the rear wheel
and 1.34 x .4 / 2 for the front tire. 0.4 tonne on each rear tire and .27
tonne on each front tire. Now we need to know how many pounds there are in
your tonne to convert to pounds, roughly.

Have each axle weighed indedpendantly at a truck scale. Actual ratio of
front to rear then can be used to calculate tire burdons. Or find a race
team. They will have 4 wheel weight scales for setting up cross balance
suspensions. 

Can we get these 8 ply Michelin Classics in the US???????? 

(All I could find in greater Seattle was Jupiter, and only on special
order. I want Continentals. Please don't sting out this as another tire
thread. The archive is enough already.)
