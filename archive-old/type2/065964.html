Not to worry Don.

I changed starters by the side of the road near Safford AZ two summers back.
Nice guy at the starter rebuild place in town told me that there is some 
variation in details like this on Bosch (and presumably other) starters.
It probably connects to some extra gizmo on some other model car. Just be
sure you label and correctly reconnect all the various wires to the correct
terminals on the new one and don't sweat the extra connection. Mine has an 
extra too (starter for my 78 auto).

Maybe some sparky with more precise detailed information can tell us just what 
that plug is for, but I don't think it matters for you.

Drive safely,
