Subject: Re: [T2] alternator tip &amp; question



&gt;Here come the additive flames(flame-suit being donned)...
&gt;
&gt;	Add some Marvel with the oil change.

Marvel in the oil? Heck while your at it, put Marvel in the GASTANK!

Make that engine a two stroke!

Okay kidding aside, I used Marvel mix in my gas on long trips for years. 
Improved gas mileage by 2. Does it (its parrafin people) ruin an engine? I 
dont know, its still running after 20 years.
