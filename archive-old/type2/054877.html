Subject: New Exhaust Installed .

       Yesterday i thought i'd replace my old stock exhaust with a brand new
muffler and tail pipe,
my Dad and i bought at a recent show.
Had a small white sticker Made in West Germany but no other markings.
Its a completely stock 72-74 exhaust with custom bent tail pipe, new gaskets
and hardware.
I installed it and also checked timing and adjusted idle per Bently.
The bus sounds throaty now with good pick up and no hesitation. Only thing
is
small backfire on deceleration. Is this an exhaust leak? Even used exhaust
sealant between the gaskets and flanges. I previously reinstalled my heater
boxes with new copper rings and have leak checked this area extensively.

     Camping with the family,  for 2 nights, this weekend at Rondeau Park on
Lake Erie .
Made myself a canopy this afternoon as the weather may turn grim:(

See ya
