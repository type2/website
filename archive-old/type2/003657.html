V W TECH made a mobile call to Indo yesterday, and delivered two brand new
heads to Nick for his 77.  He said he was having a local mechanic do the
install today.

&gt;
&gt; Hey Volks,
&gt;
&gt; My friend Nick Palmer just blew a spark plug out of his engine block --
I'm
&gt; assuming the plug was mis-threaded and it finally just popped out.
&gt;
&gt; So, he's looking for tips on a mechanic/machine shop in the area where he
&gt; can get a heli-coil put in his head, and, if possible, a driveway where he
&gt; can pull his engine/head to take it to said shop.  Barring a friendly
driveway,
&gt; a reputable VW mechanic to get towed to would suffice.
&gt;
&gt; So, if anyone can help him out with any of the above information, he'd
&gt; really appreciated it:  Nick Palmer, 916.837.5683  (cell phone)
&gt; Call him anytime as he's anxious for any info.
&gt;
&gt; alternately, if you can't get through, contact me via email.
&gt;
&gt; oh, as the subject line says, he's in Coachella, California and he's
&gt; driving a '77 Riviera:  2.0L, FI, Manual, Olive Green.
&gt;
&gt; cheers,
&gt;         t
&gt;         hoping the above content is acceptable
