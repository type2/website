Subject: Re: [T2] Using  2000 FI stuff in a 1975 1800cc engine

&gt;While I respect your experience with going with stock, Dr Tim, I want to

&gt;consuming or costly as she won't do her own work and may not be near me at
&gt;college.


So herein is a potential problem. Daughter needs service while at college. 
She takes it anywhere and tells them it's a 75. How many hours will they 
spend on it before they discover all the differences, and what they mean?? 
Will you document specifically the altered systems and will she be sure to 
give this documentation to the service provider?? Or will they find no gap 
at the valves and reset them by stock 75 solid lifter procedure?? What if 
you must adjust the AFM to full lean to get near but not quite spec 
mixture?? How long will someone continue futzing with it because this is an 
indication of something out of spec?? Down the road, the potential for lots 
of wasted time/money applying stock procedures to non-stock configuration 
will plague most if not all future owners and users and service providers.

The only weakness in a 75 FI system is 27 years age. Eventually, parts go 
out of spec. when their intended service life is exceeded.

If you want the most reliable and least costly setup, stock ist beste. It's 
just my opinion, and I respect the right of anyone to disagree. What I 
don't allow is someone trying continually to get me to validate their 
guesswork. I would if I could but I can't so I won't. I don't guess, I 
follow instructions given by those who know far more than this whole list 
put together. Herein is where certainty of results in both reliability and 
economy is most easily found by far. It guarantees the least possible waste 
of time/money.
