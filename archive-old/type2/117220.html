Subject: Japanese Site

Has anyone else noticed that the pictures of the 2005 microbus show the gas
filler on the drivers side? Is there one on both sides? What about the pop
top roof with full bucket seating in the back? And finally does anyone have
the dope on whether or not VW is really going to produce this thing? My
wife and I are very interested in getting one, its either that or a
Taurag....
