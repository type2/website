&gt;Hay! 
&gt;    I heard about a swap meet in Ogden, Utah, this saturday, the 29th.
&gt;At Bug Craft, is any other list members going? I'm planning on going,
&gt;but depends on the weather. If so I will be driving my 79' bus, White,
&gt;with a black bra, and a brown engine lid.
&gt;Thanks

    I'll be going.  Blue '80 Vanagon Westy -- trim stripes missing on side 
door, oil smoke gently wafting from the rear wheel wells... :-)
