I searched the archive with no luck so here goes.

I have an 83 air cooled westy.  I am using about a quart of oil every 200 -250
miles.  The engine has 136,000 miles on it.  The previous owner put a set of
reconditioned heads on at 132,000 miles.  I did a compression test and got the
following:
cyl 1 = 125 psig, cyl 2 = 140 psig, cyl 3 = 120 psig, cyl 4 = 150 psig.
I was expecting lower pressures given the oil usage.  Bentley specs the range
at 87-131 psig.  What’s causing the 140 and 150 psig, carbon build up perhaps?
Can those high values be contributing to my oil usage?  Any comments would be
appreciated.  Thanks.
