Thanks for all the messages about keeping her, buying her back from the
insurance company. I talked to them about that, and still have that option
at this point. I'm waiting to find out what the scrap value is. Under almost
any other circumstances, I would in a heart beat. But the horrible truth is
right now, after having my house flooded, I simply need the money.

It's a tough call we're having to make..

Jeff

doesn't mean they really want it, save her, buy her back from the
insurance company...

she has too many of your precious memories to let her go this easy.

BTW, some years back when my 78 was clipped the insurance company wanted
to total it and give me a check, I fought em showed em how much it was
worth, showed reciepts for new engine etc, etc, etc,, they finally paid me
more than the total offer to fix it, had to show it was fixed before they
would put collision coverage back on it but I still drive her today...so
for other out there, just remember the insurance company is only &quot;making
an offer to buy it at a set price&quot; when they total it, you don't have to
take the offer!
