O wise Type 2 people,

I own a couple Type 3s &amp; am currently strongly considering purchasing a 78
Westy.  Problem is I'm in Indiana &amp; the bus I really like is in California.
Being in the rust belt limits availability somewhat.  The reason I'm
considering traveling all the way across the country for this one is I can
get it for a cheap price, and it's in excellent shape.  The kicker is it
needs some engine work.  I'm fairly certain I can fly out, remove &amp; replace
&amp; drive it back.

Here's the situation on which I'd like your opinion:  Current owner bought
the bus in August for his brother in Wisconsin.  On the way back from Nevada
to where he lives in California he &quot;noticed it had low compression.&quot;  (This
guy admits he is not very mechanical at all.)  He took it into a shop where
the mechanic did a compression test &amp; said it needs &quot;a head to get by, and
while it's down you might as well replace the other one as well.&quot;  I asked a
Type IV guy about this.  He said the reason these motors usually have low
compression is because the rings aren't seating well on the cylinder walls
because of overheating.    OK, so now I'm wondering about overheating, so I
ask the current owner about idiot lights.  He says neither the heat light
nor the oil pressure light came on during his 600 mile drive.  (I wondered
about the oil pressure reasoning that if the engine overheated the oil may
break down &amp; symptoms of driving in this condition may show up in loss of
pressure in worn crank mains.)  Current owner also says he has no idea if
the idiot lights work, but everything else in the bus electrically is ok.

So, here's what I'm thinking.  I fly out to CA planning to drop the engine,
replace both heads, &amp; while everythings down  I might as well do the
cylinders, pistons &amp; rings as well to knock out all possibilities in the
compression diagnosis.

Is all that necessary?  I suspect the heads since the mechanic said only one
was necessary reportedly because both cylinders were low.  This would lead
me away from rings obviously.  But supposing all 4 are low due to
overheating &amp; ring seating trouble, can I just break the cylinder glaze &amp;
install new rings?  Or do you think I should just do the whole shmeal.
Anything I can look for that would indicate much further problems than just
low compression that would make me cut my losses &amp; take the bus home?

Thanks,
Mike
