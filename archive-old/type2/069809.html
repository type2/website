&gt; &gt; &gt;Folks:  My '82 Vanagon gets _at_ 11.5 mpg in stop-and-go, urban (&amp; hilly)
&gt; &gt; &gt;driving.  I was aghast in the beginning but, as indicated by Mike, this
&gt; &gt; &gt;seems to be in the ballpark for the circa 2L engine under these
&gt; &gt; &gt;conditions.  Cheers, Art McGinn

&gt; &gt; Can that be true?  I don't have any first-hand experience with that model,
&gt; &gt; but that kind of fuel consumption seems excessive for ANY two-liter four-cyl.

&gt; &gt; Ain

Most all well tuned 2L air cooled I have driven got 17-21 religiously in a
city weighted mix of city/highway in rather hilly Morgantown WV.  These were
in predominantly late 2L bus Westies, a fair match for the weight of a regular
Vanagon.  The '81 Westy I just drove back on a wing and a prayer of an afternoon
engine rebuild still got 20 mpg on the interstate back, but this was on intersate
with some pretty massive grades.  Personally I feel anything under 15 mpg out
of a 2L air cooled means trouble somewhere.  It has always in fact amazed me that
the late T4 powered van and the Wasserboxers seem nearly immune to driving
conditions affecting mileage in WV &quot;the Mountain State&quot;.  As a rule my mileage
never fluctuates in a van more than 2-3 mpg around 20 mpg, regardless of the city
highway mix if the engine is in good shape tuned and running correctly.  Just my 
opinions.  This said we'll see how the rebuild for the '81 does after I get it in
this week.
