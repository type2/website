Subject: Re: [T2] Re: [VB] VW Buses in Movies

In the movie &quot;1969&quot; Keifer Sutherland trades in his brothers Corvair for 
a bus. My first vehicle was a 66 bus and a couple of years later I 
bought a 65 Corvair.  I saw the movie with my brother and he said, 
&quot;Aren't those your cars?&quot;.  The ones in the movie may not be the right 
years, but damn, they looked the same.

GOD
