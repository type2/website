Subject: Re: [T2] childs cot question

Hi Keri,

Before we can tell you where the brackets go, we need to know the 
precise length of the poles. Different years came in different lengths, 
and the brackets mount in different places. Once we know what year your 
poles are, we can tell you where they get mounted.

Happy trails,

&gt; Hi, I received a child's cot this last summer &amp; want to install it.  I 
&gt; have some holes where I believe the brackets go (behind the front 
&gt; seats), but have no idea about the front brackets.  Just wondering if 
&gt; anyone has up close photos of all 4 brackets?  Before I start to 
&gt; drilling I want to make sure I have them in the right place.  I have a 
&gt; '69 bus.
&gt; thanks,
