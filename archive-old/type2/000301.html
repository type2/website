Hi all just trolling through the 120 digests (gulp) that I missed while
otherwise occupied (complications with our baby, due next month) amongst
other things. Mr Whipy is getting his panels put in now &amp; I need him for the
22nd of July, so times creeping up on me. I am still to get the last months
digests, so forgive me if I sin &amp; say that my trade is Electrician.

R.B.C

The Bus I sold for a friend a couple of months ago is going on a trip
through most of Europe down to Egypt &amp; back via Cyprus! Now I'm not a
pessimist, but what countries are better to breakdown in? :(

Based on spares cost/availability.

THIS IS FOR EUROPE ONLY, SORRY, NOT U.K OR U.S.A
