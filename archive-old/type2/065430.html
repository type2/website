Subject: the goodies

Hi all - gave my friend the first batch of responses to his garage
cleaning. He was duly impressed; not even owning a watch, I think the
concept of this newsgroup leaves him a little nonplussed. He is going to
dig thru the stuff to see if anything matches the want lists (40 hp tin,
6volt starters and 36 HP folks should smile. Apparently, no -20- cases,
tho) tonight. I'll prolly see him again Friday, will email the individuals
w/ the results of their queries, and hopefully the whole hog will be typed
up for everyone in the next week or two. Be warned - it will be LONG. Was 7
or 8 pages last time he made a list (lost it promptly).
- -Craig
