Subject: Re: [T2] I'm Confused! Bus vs. bug heater boxes

Originally, the relay lever style heater boxes that had the lower cable
connectors were used on Late 63-74 Bugs &amp; Ghias, Late 63-67 Type 2.  The
heater boxes without the relay levers with the cable connectors higher
up were for 68-71 Type 2 only.

&gt; Well, my excellent adventure in early bay window buses continues.
&gt; I had always thought that the heater boxes with the relay lever were for
&gt; buses and the boxes without the relay lever were for bugs.  This evening,
&gt; I
&gt; pulled the exhaust off my (J-tube equipped) 1969 european westfalia and
&gt; went
&gt; to put on (and did put on) the &quot;bus&quot; heater boxes I''ve been saving for
&gt; years.  Once they were on, I noticed that the stubs of the broken heater
&gt; control cables come out of their tubes to the outside and above the heater
&gt; boxea, not inside and below!
&gt; What gives???  have I been wrong all these years?  is the relay lever box
&gt; only for some years/models?m Is there a difference between bus and bug
&gt; heater boxes?
&gt; Marcus....  save those boxes!!!  I think I'm going to need them!
