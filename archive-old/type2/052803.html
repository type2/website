Subject: Bus sighting

On a trek deep (very deep) thru the muddy (very muddy) hallows of 
southwestern Pennsylvania today I found a beige 72-73 Westy that was very 
much the worse for wear.  It appeared to have been in a flood at some point 
and was extremely trashed.  
Interestingly it had 'T-I-B-E-T' scratched into the hatch in 10 inch letters. 
 
As something like this would be easy to remember, did anybody lose this bus 
somewhere down the line?
