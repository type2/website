Subject: Re: Auto Tranny Reverse Light Switch Location

&gt;From: Access Systems I've been looking for 12 years, haven't found mine.  
&gt;from what I recently
&gt;discovered is that on the 010 auto tranny the switch is in the shifter at
&gt;the front, the older tranny had it on the tranny itself,  but I still
&gt;haven't found the switch.


Then that makes sense of the last post I made. But I can't find the fuse. 
Did the older tranny used a vacuum switch to work the lights? The switch 
seems to be in the shifter or it is at least a mechanical/electrical switch, 
no vacuum of course the older auto tranny could be the same way and no 
vacuum. The only thing I know now is that my lights work and play with the 
shifter flickers the lights.

Will let you know where I find it if I do,
