Subject: rear corner repair &amp; door skins
Date: Tue, 20 Mar 2001 09:51:44 -0500
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

hello, I'm currently attempting to resurrect my '77 Kombi station wagen, and
one of the major repairs it needs is the right rear corner needs to
replaced. Due to being hit in a parking lot, (real hard), the corner is
caved in as high as the top of the tail light assembly. Now, I'm currently
looking to replace this corner with the panel from Bus Depot, that is the
panel for the whole right rear corner, vent fins included. My question
being...has anyone had any luck with this panel, and how did you install it,
and is it something one can do with a moderate knowledge of body damage
repair. My concern is reattaching the NEW panel and not so much removing the
old...
also, same circumstances with the door skins for the front doors...years of
living in colorado, gave a little amount of rust on the door edges. Cheaper
and safer to repair myself? or get done by a professional?

She will be a beautiful bus when I'm done,
378,000+ and still purring...
thanks
