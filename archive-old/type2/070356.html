Subject: Re: Tool question

&gt;The person behind the counter told me [air hammer sockets]
&gt;were not made for use with
&gt;socket wrenches, just air tools.  That I was likely to break
&gt;them if I used a 1/2 breaker bar.

Don't know what to tell you. I take that 1 13/16 and a six-foot water pipe
and *wail* on stuff. I always win. ;) The air socket looks far beefier than
its chrome brethren, much thicker walls. I can't imagine why a tool
designed for sharp bursts of torque would break from sustained pressure
(although I can imagine a problem the other way around, from being
brittle).

In some of these rusty axle nut scenarios, I bet people have enough
leverage to get up around 1000 ft/lbs. I want a socket with B U L K.
