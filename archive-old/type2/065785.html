Subject: Re: Why leaded gasoline is cheaper than unleaded gas.

I used to have quite a few old National Geographics from the '20's and '3=
0's which had many advertisements for &quot;Ethyl&quot; gas. It's slogan was &quot;Ask f=
or Ethyl&quot;. Ethyl I beleive was the first leaded additive for gasoline, an=
d for quite a few years you had to look for the &quot;Ethyl&quot; sign on the pump =
if you wanted leaded gas. I don't think that leaded gas became standard u=
ntill the end of WWII, when the major auto manufacturers started producin=
g high compression engines as the standard.
