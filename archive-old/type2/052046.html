Subject: [T2] Mystery Parts &amp; Part Number Identification

Hey Everyone,
    I found these parts on my stash the other day.  They were in a NOS box with the part number 211 035 657 A  and the word &quot;ENTSTORSATZ&quot;.  I figured there were type2 parts inside.  I look inside to find two black boxes, some kind of electrical items I've never seen before.  They are both unused.  The part numbers are 311 955 203  and 111 035 267 A  Here's a little description:

1st part
 about 1.5 in X 1.5in X .5 in box with a green wire and a red wire coming out of it also has the words &quot;zum Storer&quot; printed on the side.

2nd part
smaller box with just one single black wire. Has &quot;0,47uF/100V&quot; printed on it.

Anyone have an idea as to what these things are?  I figured they might be for a type 1 or 3 VW's from the part number?  I can send a picture to you (not the list) if you need it.

Thanks a lot,
