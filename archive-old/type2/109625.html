Poor picture, but these are Dodge Daytona seats bolted directly to the seat
pedestals. I love them, they are super comfortable and still look great after 8
years.

I removed the seat tracks permanently and bolted the seat to suit me. :)

Has anyone ever put a different kind of front seat in a bay? I was thinking
something from the Jetta or Gold would be nice. Any body know what would be
involved to make that work?
