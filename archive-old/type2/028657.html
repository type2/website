&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Howdy all!
&gt; 
&gt; 1. How far apart are the one quart low and full 
&gt; markings on a pancake engine's dipstick?  Less 
&gt; than half an inch?  There's another mark scratched 
&gt; in mine another half inch up and I'm trying to figure 
&gt; it out.
&gt; 
&gt; 2. My poptop doesn't stay all the way down on 
&gt; the driver's side.  I'm sure no fabric is caught up in 
&gt; there and am wondering if there is a way to adjust 
&gt; it or something?  It's been like that since I bought it, 
&gt; made for a nice draft during my winter road trip.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks in advance,
&gt; Christopher Darilek
