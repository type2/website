Subject: Best way to put rings on???

I have a T-4 2.0 FI engine.  I recently tore the top half down and was
wondering what is the best way to put the rings on??  Are there any tricks?
I'm not sure if putting them on with the pistons on the rod is the best
(easiest) way or if putting the rings on with the pistons off the rods are the
best way??  It looks like pistons on the rods will be a little easier, but I'm
not sure though.  My ring compressor will open up if I put the rings on with
the pistons on the rods.

Thanks,

Mike
