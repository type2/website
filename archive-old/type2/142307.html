&gt;I got my new issue of Griot's Garage today. Griot's is a car care company that
&gt;is run by a person named Richard Griot. The man is a fanatic and everything I
&gt;have ever bought from his company is above great quality. He lists several
&gt;tire pressure gauges including a racetrack one that is accurate to = pound.
&gt;The company's website is
&gt;
&gt;http://www.griotsgarage_dot_com/index.jsp .

Griot's has a reputation for selling products at inflated prices after removing the labelling from the product that identifies the original mfgr. It's company policy not to disclose the name of the mfgrs. Quiet often a web search will reveal the same product at much lower prices.

FYI.
