Subject: Re: [T2] engine swap ?

right on eric you and i have had this conversation before....
 
if anyone on the list has ever seen dicko and loris bus they have dropped a 1600 in there bus which is i think if right maybe eric will know? but i am thinking there bus is a 73 or 75? cant remember buddah might know also...
the tin that was used in there bus was a fabricated shell that goes around the engine as the old tin would have but this one closes off the other open areas that the regualr 1600 tin wouldnt when a type 4 would....
its a really neat looking shell i think its all made from fiberglass but lol cant remember that either... if i see them in the bus at high coutry i will snap a few clicks for the list,its really sweet....
 
i at one time even thought of this for my bus before i got a type 4 1.8 i bought for her ...
 
gotta change that flywheel though or use a smaller tranny one... the other tranny is geared to high for the 1600..... like mine uses a 228 flywheel much to big for a split or bug engine/tranny

&gt; Will a 1600 drop into a later (72 or 73) bus?

Yes, and I think it is a good swap. All international busses, non US, had the
good old 1600 DP all the way through '79. You can still buy a brand new bay
window bus in Brazil, and it will have a 1600 DP.

I took pictures of my '73 bus engine conversion and posted them here:

I hope this helps.
