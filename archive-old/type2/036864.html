Subject: shipping

Hello all,
  I am going to be shipping a VW Bus front axle
beam. I need to know if anyone has any Ideas how
to go about doing this. It will be going coast to
coast(almost). Any idea how much it weighs? Its a
74 with master,booster, rotors, but no calipers.
How would I box it up? Any help would be great.
