As for the exhaust leak, I'm going to see how some VERY HIGH TEMP silicone works on this. 

That is an experiment that is destined for failure. Take the time to do
the job right. Remove heat exchanger. Scrutinize the studs. Replace if
rusted or worn. Use a new gasket. Check the flange. Is it warped from over
torquing? Use the BIG velvet hammer to bend it as straight as possible.
Use a BIG file to flatten it further. Torque to spec. or mayby a LITTLE
more. That's flat, clean flanges, good studs, factory gasket and torque
and no goops or RTV. If that doesn't work there is something non-spec
at play.
