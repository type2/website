Subject: Re: [T2] Re:Strange thoughts when bored at work...

Jason,
Allow me to elaborate on the merits of the Wasserleaker.
( not that I am in love with them--i worked on my 89 this very day--it
was leaking from the bypass tube that circumvents the top of the engine
compartment--)

First, they fly in comparison to the air cooled units-and can be held at
a constant speed's without worrying about frying a valve.

They do ave Beacouix heat in the winter.

You can run the AC without over taxing the engine.
And they are good for--an easy 150--200k without getting nervious about
then blowing up.

The only problem is with big miles the coolant system needs, or requires
attention.

At say--150--160 kI would thin that most folks would think that the
hoses, and related coolant sundries have done thier job well, and should
be replaced.

It's a trade off--burnt valves and guides--or blowing hoses---

Take your pick--each vehicle or engine most certainly has their own
quirks--

I run 70--75 mph all day on a trip in my Vanagon Westy--or Carat-- with
the Ac blairing--where I have to control my right foot on my type 2, for
fear of smoking the valve train.

I like them both for what they are--but in the 74 Westy--I stay closer
to home with it--
