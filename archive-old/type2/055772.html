I recently purchased a 1978 VW Bus with a Sportsmobile conversion
package in
it. The interior suffered from severe dry rot, and had to be taken out.
I
contacted the Sportsmoblie people to see if they still offered
accesories for
it, and they do not. I wanted to know if you had any ideas where I could
get
an original or similar interior? Please help.
