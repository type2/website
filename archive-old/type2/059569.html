Subject: 72: Still eating brake fluid.

Yep.

The bastard is haunting me again.  Was going to bring it home this weekend
to finish it (yoink the windshield, rerust, repair holes, repaint,
reinstall windshield with new seal), but the old man said &quot;this weekend
isnt a good one&quot;  Fark.  It'll probably be spring before I can get the POS
out here.  *sigh*  soon as that done, he signs over the 66. 

Phooie.  

Anyhow.  He says he's driven it a few more times (he thinks it shifts to
hard...he's gotten used to shifting that automatic in his F*rd, is what I
say...), and it has once again eaten most of the brake fluid.

Note that this is after a brand shtinking new master cylinder.  NO
external leakage.

So.  What now?

Power brake booster still sucking it, I presume...Sheet.
