--I think I bought something from this guy once. Crotchety old-timer with memory problems (no offense to c.o.t.w.m.p. on this list!) in Pennsylvania if I recall correctly. I'd give him a little more time.

&gt;Hey folks, has anyone ever heard of the above referenced business?  I 
&gt;bought an antenna from them for my single cab on Eb*y last week and can't 
&gt;get in touch with them.  Their phone number is 1-866-VW-MOTOR.  I've 
&gt;already paid for the item, sent 2 emails and left 3 phone messages and get 
&gt;absolutely no response whatsoever.  I don't know what part of the country 
&gt;they're located in.  Have I been taken?  tx, greg
