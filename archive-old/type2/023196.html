My suggestion is tach, oil temp, oil pressure, and cylinder head temp.

The warning lights are fine too but I don't like the idea of using my oil 
pressure light to tell me anything else. Lack of info caused by that - low 
oil? high temps? out of gas? Wire in a separate bulb for any warning lights.

I like warning lights and will probably run one for head temps as an eye 
catcher (maybe a buzzer on a switch as well).

I run VDO gauges. They fit my budget. Buy the best you can afford. VDO has 
gotten a bad rap a few times on the list for accuracy complaints. Test the 
temp gauges with boiling water on the stove. At least you'll know where 212 
degrees is. I don't worry so much about the numbers - but I have a 
benchmark now and know if the needle is high or low then there might be a 
problem.

Also on the head temps - consider running one for each side with a switch 
so you can switch back and forth when haven't got enough to worry about... 
&lt;grin&gt;

On the oil pressure gauge - I suggest a dual sender so you retain the idiot 
light but also have the gauge.

You can check http://aircraft-spruce_dot_com/main.html

for some great dual gauges - gauges with dual indicator needles - oil temp 
+ oil pressure or whatever combo you might dream about. Twice the info in 
the same amount of space.

Good luck.
