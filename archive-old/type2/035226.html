Subject: Re: Westy parts wanted

Stefan Bauhaus &lt;webmaster_at_stefanbauhaus_dot_de&gt; (by way of Ken Hooper) asked:

 &gt;.....i´m restoring a 1976 westalia helsinki camper
 &gt;(can see it on my hp) and need some special parts. i´m almost finished
 &gt;and realised that two little parts are american parts. the power plug on
 &gt;the outside of the bus and the vent cover from the plumbing (both left
 &gt;side).  can you tell me where i can find it. best would be a online shop.

They are both (or at least used to be) available from:

Euro-American RV Products

They *almost* have a website at:
