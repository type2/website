Subject: bleeding brakes by oneself

I need to replace my right front brake hose. I live in the country, alone, 
and am hoping to do this today.
Re bleeding: If I run a small hose from the bleeder to a container w clean 
fluid in it, keeping the open end of the hose below the fluid level in the 
container, should I be able to pump air out w/o sucking it back in?
I know to keep the res topped off.
Thanks
Best wishes
