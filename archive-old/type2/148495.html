Subject: Re: [T2] POR-15 binstead of underseal

Rust Bullet works great for me. I've used it for the heater control
boxes and have tested it on some underside portions of my 78 Westy. I
thought the instructions and procedures for POR 15 were harder to
follow than Rust Bullet. So far, I'm impressed with Rust Bullet. It
covers and sticks as described by the mfgr. Once it's dry it isn't
affected by any comonly available solvents. I've used POR and think
that Rust Bullet is much easier to use.
