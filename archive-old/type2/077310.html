Subject: Re: [T2] Balancing act

&gt;   Would appreciate any workable suggestions.
&gt;

Find a place that does medium size trucks. They might have an 
adjustable adaptor or even the correct one. You can also call around 
tire shops in your area and find inquire if they or anyone they know 
has the old type of machine the balances the tires on the car. This 
has the added advantage of balancing the drums along with the tires.
