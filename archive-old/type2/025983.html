Jeff, if your engine has been around a bit, I would suggest running a 20W-50
weight oil.  With the hotter outside temps, the engine runs hotter to.  The
heavier weight will stick in your bearings that much longer after heating
up.  Also, from being around racing, I have learned that racing and VW
engines run much hotter than the standard water cooled cars, so the oil
breaks down quicker under the higher temps.  To avoid oil breaking down
before your next oil change and to keep the oil &quot;sticky&quot; at higher temps
which allow it to stay in the bearings longer, I use an additive that I can
only find at NAPA.  It is an oil additive manufactured by Lucas.  Great
stuff, I use one quart at each oil change.  You won't beleive how much
healthier your oil looks when you drain it out at oil change.

All this talk about oils and additives.  Put the rumors to rest, take some
old pans (get some cheap at a garage sale) and add 1/8 cup of oil to each.
Use some 30W, standard grade, some 30W synthetic, then some 20W-50 straight,
then 20W-50W with a bit of Lucas in it.  You might want to do this out doors
on your camp stove as you will have some smoke.  At school when I show the
kids this test, we do it under the welding smoke exhaust fan.  Turn up the
stove to high (remember your engine oil temp can get as high as 260-280 for
short periods) and watch the pans.  Go ahead and let the oil burn down some.
Make sure you &quot;cook&quot; each oil the same amount of time.  You won't beleive
the results!!!    

Don't listen to those who haven't done any testing, they are just repeating
what they have heard, do the testing yourself and you will have first hand
information.  Your engine will last much longer if you use the proper oil
and additives.  Of course always drive your air cooled engine as it should
be driven, if you drive it like it was water cooled, nothing will help you.

&gt; i have a 1971 bus 1600 and had a question about oil chages.....what oil
&gt; grade is rec. for  the summer( iam in the midwest)
&gt; and has anyone ever used additive in the oil...
&gt; thank
&gt; jeff
