Subject: Re: [T2] Question about Sodium Exhaust Valves on 1600's

Folks,

The company I work for actually has them made to our specifications. 

What would really be required is what is called an &quot;articulated&quot; borescope 
and it actually bends slightly back and forth on the &quot;business&quot; end....but 
not enough to actually use on a set of T1 heads....I'd have to think about 
whether it might work on t4 heads.

And Richard is right, even with the latest high density fiber optics from 
Germany, the view is marginal at best....you could see something laying on 
top of the piston, and see it well, but probably could not make it turn 
enough to actually look at a valve....much less a carbon  covered valve.

The rigid borescopes however are excellent, even the ones that have right 
angle prism views in them.  I have a system that will actually measure 
cracks on turbine blades to less than 5 thousand'ths error with one of 
these.  The price on the rigid scopes, depending on length and such is 
probably close to $6,000 each!  Generally used to inspect an expensive 
turbing engine before deciding whether to spend $150,000(shipping alone)
to send it back to the manufacturer for a rebuild.

Cheers, dave

&gt; &gt;So a person needs a $200+ scope to be useful? Wow... Too rich for me...
&gt; 
&gt; The image quality is so poor you can't really see anything 
worth seeing which defeats the purpose of them. 
There seems to be a large jump in price between 
these low cost units and ones that work as you'd expect. 


Good optics don't' come cheap?
