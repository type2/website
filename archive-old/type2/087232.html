Subject: Re: [T2] type 2 on CD

Did you guys see this one!!!

entley Publishers is proud to announce the publication of original 
Volkswagen Official Factory Microfiche Archived on CD-ROM


The set is $600, but you can buy individual ones..type 1,2,3,4 for $99.95

Bob, they say windoze, but do they really mean it....I don't run windoze 
either....and hope i never do again(linux).

Wups, went and read all of their stuff...and they even dropped mac support
in February....well, they won't be getting my cdrom biz....


Cheers, dave

&gt; &gt; Did my message about the Bentley CD get out to the list?
&gt; &gt; I got a response to it but not yet the original message.
&gt; 
&gt; yeah it got out, visited the Bentley site, and they will not support any
&gt; browser other than windoz....probably wouldn't like it on the computer
&gt; anyway so will stick to dead tree version, however if they do a Linux
&gt; version I might buy a copy just to support em.
