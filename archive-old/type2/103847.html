&gt; &gt; You can get an adaptor for about $20 that will screw
&gt; &gt; into those big 20 Lb
&gt; &gt; refillable propane tanks. the little 1 Lb throwaway
&gt; &gt; bottle will screw in to
&gt; &gt; the other end and you can refill them and reuse
&gt; &gt; them. So, hang on to your
&gt; &gt; throwaway propane cannisters



The instructions that came with the adaptor say to put your empty disposable
tanks into the freezer to get them chilled so you get a good
refilling..basically, you hook the two cylinders together, flip the big tank
upside down then open the hand valve, wait for a minute, then shut the valve
off and unscrew the now-refilled small cylinder... they also say you can use
the adaptor to add propane from disposable cylinders into a big 20 LB
tank...just leave the big tank in the upright position.

For my Westie tank, I made up a non-sparking plastic hammer to tap the valve
in case it gets stuck (frozen) in the open position during filling.... I had
that happen once and the guy pulled off the hose and an entire tank of
propane vented out of the fill nozzle into the atmosphere... it was pretty
scary!! But the propane guy didn't think it was any big deal..... they took
my vehicle back into their shop and pulled out the valve and, after trying
to sell me a new valve, they settled for just cleaning and lubricating it
and putting it back in. After that, the tank filled up without sticking
open...later, it happened again, but the GIRL who filled it, just picked up
a small brass hammer and gave the valve a couple of light taps and that
fixed it. She said &quot;yeah, that happens every so often, especially in damp
humid weather...no big deal&quot; SO, now I keep the plastic hammer in my
bus....just in case.
