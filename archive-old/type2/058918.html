Subject: Administrivia - List status

Volks,

We had a short glitch Sunday and yesterday, which Thom fixed (thank
you, Thom! :-), but I got a couple of requests for list status.  Now
first, let me say that this was *wonderful*!  It is exactly what I would
love to happen! :-)  If you ever have a question with the list, write me.
At the same time, there is a definite need for better information, so....

As you may (or may not) know, I started putting copies of the digests at
my ftp site after the last list debacle, so people could catch up.  I have
been maintaining this archive and I have now added a file called
status.txt to it.  If I know there is something wrong with the list, I
will put everything I know about the problem in that file.  Because it is
not at azaccess, even if the whole of azaccess is dead, you should still
be able to get to it.  If you can't get to the file and you can't get to
azaccess either, suspect a problem at your end or very close to you.

The address of the ftp site is:

ftp://ftp.ari_dot_net/users/dworkin

The URL for the status file would be:

ftp://ftp.ari_dot_net/users/dworkin/status.txt

This is not to say if you notice a problem and the file says the list is
up that you shouldn't write, because I might not have twigged to it yet
and your question may alert me to its existence.

In theory, there is no difference between theory and practice. 
But, in practice, there is.
