Hello Listers:

I noticed that The Bus Depot lists a cover for 68-79 campers.  Does anyone 
have experience with this or similar covers?

I want to protect my '76 Campmobile from the elements and have no room in 
the garage due to the daily drivers.

Thanks for your input.

Walt Fogle
'76 Campmobile
Woodinville, WA
