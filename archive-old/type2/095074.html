Subject: Re: [T2] Point bounce:


&gt;What I'm saying is that sometimes the spark seems to fire a little later 
&gt;and the timing mark moves a few of degrees. The idle isn't rough, it just 
&gt;isn't 100% rock steady at idle 7.5 BTDC.  Before I replaced the points and 
&gt;rotor it wasn't consistent at all: the points, has a huge pit and a 
&gt;matching tit where they had melted, and the rotor (rev limiting 04016) had 
&gt;big holes in the metal contact at the edge.

How old is your condenser?  Sounds like an electrical phenomenon, not a 
mechanical one.
