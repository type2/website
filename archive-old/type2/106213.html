Subject: Re: [T2] More Questions...

&gt; 1) What type of motor oil do I use for my 1.8 motor? IE: 5W-30? 5W-40? or is
&gt; it even 50 weight?

i wouldnt recommend 5w but anything from 20w50 to 30 to 40 any is really
fine. your pref.


&gt; 2) Is the Bosch distributor original equipment?

a bosch would be original youll have to get the numbers off of and have a
look at type2_dot_com , library . distributers to id it.


&gt; 3) The car came with a standard 2-bbl carburetor (I believe), but we also
&gt; got with the car, a dual carburetor set-up.. they're Webber carbs. It also
&gt; came with a stack of books, etc. Obviously, I'm not planning on entering
&gt; this bus in the 24 huers de Le Mans any time soon... but I was curious how
&gt; much horsepower if any that would provide over the standard 2bbl carb it has
&gt; now?

none of that sounds stock.

&gt; 4) Do you guys know of anywhere that actually SELLS used glass? After
&gt; looking at the price of refurbished side vents.. I'm wondering if I wouldn't
&gt; just be better off purchasing whole windows for the rear and buying new
&gt; gaskets. Of the places I looked.. they don't sell actual glass.
&gt;

right. did you check with bustedbus_dot_com?

&gt; Last question... why do some of my windows have the Audi OOOO symbol on them
&gt; and others do not?

that is the autounion logo. vw and audi are interconnected companies.
look up the history.
