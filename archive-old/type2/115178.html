&gt;Does anyone have any experience or suggestions regarding converting a 71 
&gt;Westy
&gt;into a non-poptop vehicle?  Basically I just need to fill in the hole in 
&gt;the
&gt;roof.
&gt;
&gt;Or if there is someone in the Seattle area who has a standard bus that 
&gt;they'd
&gt;like to trade for a westy, I'd be open to discussion.  This is not the 
&gt;world's
&gt;most perfect westy, but it starts right up, and runs and drives well.

Hal,

Good question. I can not get a poptop bus into my garage (too tall). I have 
had to turn down some good poptops for this reason. I walk by a bus near me, 
that has a clear plastic cover where the sunroof once was. The poptop canvas 
hold down screw holes would have to be filled.
