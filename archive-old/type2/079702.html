Subject: Re: [T2] H4 Conversion kits

My 78 westy has had H4 lights for about 10 years or so. I have never been
asked/questioned/hassled/otherwise. They throw more light and don't bother
anyone, if aimed properly.

&gt; Generally, they are not DOT legal because back then they required the
&gt; reflector to be sealed.  There were a few H4 lights that were DOT legal
&gt; because they built a glass bulb around the H4 bulb inside the light.  I
&gt; think that they were marketed under the &quot;Bobi&quot; name.

&gt; I've never been hassled for my H4 lights.  Unless you have nasty
&gt; inspectors you have little to worry about if they are aimed properly.
