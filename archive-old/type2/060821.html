	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

They will make noise upon sitting, particularly as they accumulate miles, a
mild ticking to a heavy pounding on startup.  After sitting a year or so
unmoved (my old '78) one or two pounded for the better part of an hour
before quieting.  When worn they will also tick on throttle letoff after
load.  If you really are dying to mess with them the best procedure is as
follows.  Pull the covers and feel if any are &quot;spongy&quot; if you can take a big
screwdriver on the ridged peened lower end of the rocker opposite the
pushrod and it moves grudgingly as if you are pressing a spring, there is
air in that lifter and it isn't pumped a good pumped lifter will be rock
solid (or nearly so in varying degrees) like a solid lifter.  If they are
airy, you've got 2 choices if you are dying to adjust them for some reason,
well 3 actually.

Assuming you know how to adjust valves, and how to find TDC for each
sensibly as you will probably have to do one side at a time and can't be
turning the engine all they way round a few times to come back to 4 after 3
or whatever.

     1. Dissasemble everything, bench bleed them in cold, thick (40wt
straight) oil, reassemble, and adjust, this is a real pill as you'd have to
pull rockers, pushrods, pushrod tubes, lifter (in order, don't mess em up),
etc.  I've done this when I was replacing pushrod tube seals anyway.  For
this I'd go ahead and do 2 turns past contact like the book says.
     2. Stephens reccomends a procedure that makes sense, start the engine
and run at a good rpm (2500) or so for 30 seconds, run back there pop a
cover, and start at them, assuming the short run has made everything solid
on that one side, adjust the side to .006 clearance just like solid lifter,
run to the other side and do the same.  Problem here is that when they get
about 100k on them they might only hold up for about a minute or 2 so you
got to be damn fast turning that engine and working the adjusters.  Else you
do the first side, put the cover back on, run another 30 seconds, do the
other side.  When you get them all to .006, run the engine at 2500 for about
a minute, will sound like the noisiest most maladjusted solid lifter engine
you ever heard, but you should be garanteeing that the lifters are pumping
up fully in case some idiot not understanding hydraulics had previously run
the adjusters too far in.  You won't hurt anything, it will sound terrible
but be no worse than the ole '77 engine or any to proceed it.  Now run back
again and adjust all to contact plus 1.5 turns.  Yeah the engine ain't stone
cold, yeah everyone told you your whole life that was a cardinal sin, but
they grew up before hydraulics, there is so much intinsic play and
adjustment in those suckers, moving even .010&quot; (ridiculously impossible
anyway) wouldn't even matter.  Going for contact plus 1.5 puts you a bit on
the short side of the origional VW 2 turn spec so if things have heated
you'll be OK.  Same problem with this procedure, if the lifters are real
bad, even after the loose run pump up, they won't hold very long and you may
have to run it again, this is a real pain cause you are slapping valve
covers on and off, going side to side, turning the crank pulley (a pain on
the T4) etc, etc.
     3.  So my favorite method, but this takes a little technique.  If you
do it stone cold sitting there, even if a lifter is full of air and totally
dead, if you loosen the adjuster screw a couple turns (so it is open a bit
past contact) you can rock it back and forth and tell by feel and sound when
it has just contacted the pushrod and when you are instead compressing the
lifter.  This is sort of a matter of time thing, I can largely tell audibly
when a solid lifter engine is adjusted right, I rock the rocker back and
forth and if the valve stem is in good shape as are the screws you can here
the difference between say about .005 and .010, I can probably by feel and
sound get a set within .004 to .008 which is fine for hydraulics as you are
about to randomly and grossly turn the screw another 1.5 to 2 turns.  So if
you loosen one with a soft lifter then rock it back and forth while nudgind
the screw just to the point where it contacts but before it compresses the
soft lifter (THIS IS A REAL FINE PERCEPTION HERE, compared to the 2 turns on
a pumped lifter which is relative hard to do, the 2 turns on an airy lifter
are little more effort than turning the screw before contact) but if you can
percieve when this is the case, you can go around doing about 1.5 past
contact on all screws cold in the normal manner and be close enough for
government work and for your worn lifters.

Or just don't mess with them, they are probably fine anyway.  If the engine
is not grossly dirty inside but has sat and the lifters are noisy, another
trick, drain the oil and fill with 10W straight if you can still find it or
Dexron ATF.  Run it for maybe 4-5 15 minute idle runs sitting while cooling
a half hour in between.  Drain and fill with new oil (NEVER Quaker State on
a VW hydraulic lifter and I will always stand by that) and see if they are
not quiet.  This is a sort of scary thing though, if in fact the engine was
pretty gunky inside with a lot of buildup (much burnt oil in the rocker
boxes a good indicator) such an extreme rotorooter may cause a lot of harm
freeing up crap to get stuck in small oil passages, in the bearings, etc.
Should be done ideally only with an oil pressure and temperature gage to
monitor in case the high mileage pump can't pump the thin stuff to any
pressure.  That procedure is entirely at your discretion, and the realistic
consequence of immediate engine replacement should weigh in your mind.
