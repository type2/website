Eric says&quot;

&gt; rust is slowly attacking my rocker panels ,wheel arches and various other
&gt; places. what is a good preventative maintenence job i could do to stop the
&gt; process until i can go ahead and get the job done right.. How do
&gt; I slow down
&gt; the process of surface rust.

A real quick cheap one is to paint oil on the surface.. it soaks nicely in
and provides a barrier to air and water. reapply as necessary. Wash it off
later with petrol.
