If you look at the picture on the left at this link, in the lower right
corner of that picture you can see the left-hand top back corner of the
passenger seat pedestal.

In my bus, in this corner of the pedestal, and in the same place on the
driver's side pedestal, there are two small plastic &quot;things&quot;.  The best that
I can do to describe them is that they look like the wings off of a Buck
Rogers' spaceship.

There's a flat bit that has a &quot;jet engine&quot; shape attached to it.  The
&quot;engine&quot; is sliced in half so that the flat bit and the &quot;engine&quot; can sit
flat on the pedestal top, with a hole where the exhaust of the &quot;engine&quot;
would be.

With both &quot;things&quot; positioned so that they face each other across the space
between the front seats, one could possibly run a dowel from the hole in one
&quot;engine&quot;, to the hole in the other.

All I can figure is that maybe the two &quot;things&quot; might be part of something
to hold the seatbelt when not in use?  Ideas?
