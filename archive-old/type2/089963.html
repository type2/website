Subject: vanagon seats &amp; more


I'm hittin' the road this weekend to visit a friend
and an 82 Vanagon he has on his farm.  I'll probably
take the front seats home with me for my 79.  What
tools do I need to remove the front seats?  Should
I take the seat tracks and all?

Also, will the sliding door interior panel from the 82
fit my 79?

Eventually I plan to drag this van home with me. I have=20
a 78 engine in my van, could I just take the shortblock
from the 82 and put my 78 heads on it?

Thanks,

Rob
