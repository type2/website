&gt;&gt;Ric and I could rendezvous at the site of Chuckie's Redneck Campout in
&gt;&gt;Cosby, TN.  Chuckie or no Chuckie, we could all congregate there and pay
&gt;&gt;homage to the baton.  Pass this along to any folks over on your side of
&gt;&gt;the continental divide and let's see how many people we can muster for
&gt;&gt;this once-in-a-lifetime event!  Let me know.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;Just got off the phone with Triple Creek Campground (phone 423-623-2020).
&gt; I searched the archives for &quot;Cosby&quot; and found the phone number.  I was
&gt;informed that Chuckie's Redneck Campout IS this weekend (why wasn't it
&gt;posted to this list sooner?)!   
&gt;
&gt;WOOHOO!! Or rather,  YEEHAW!!
&gt;
&gt;Anyhow, take exit #440 (US 321 to Gatlinburg) off of interstate 40 and
&gt;follow the signs.
