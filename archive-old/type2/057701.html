&gt;Hi all....
&gt;[...]
&gt;With the [new imported] beetles, we have cut through the red tape by
rebuilding
&gt;the cars onto a 1972 or older pan, and using the original title to register
&gt;with.   By using cars that are 1972 or older, there is no smog required in
&gt;California, and a new registration is not neccessary...   [...]

Can they be imported WITH a smog test and new registry?

&gt;We looked into importing the Brazillian made buses... but.. there are many
&gt;problems... Firstly, the buses are not air cooled.  [...]

It seems that the Brazilian ones are and the Mexican ones are waterbuses.
Does it matter for being able to import them or not import them whether
they're aircooled or watercooled?

&gt;[...] This would
&gt;make it impossible for us to import them by swapping out the chassis with
&gt;VIN and older registration from a U.S. registered older bus.


Is is true, then, that the only way a car can be imported from Mexico or
Brazil is to cut it off and weld it to the pan of an older car?

What is the law that prevents it?  Just out of curiosity, since I know none
of this stuff and I want one!

Shade and sweet water,
Brian
