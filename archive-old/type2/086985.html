Subject: Re: [T2] towing question

&gt; I need to tow a 74 bus from Ohio to NC. Assuming I have no
&gt; special equipment, which I don't, what is the best way to do
&gt; it? I called a rental place, and they said a tow dolly couldn't
&gt; be used because the &quot;driveline is too hard to disconnect&quot;. They

leave it in neutral.   or remove the half shafts, not that hard.

&gt; suggested a trailer (all 4 wheels off the ground). Yea, nay, bogus,
&gt; or right on?

that being said, I will ONLY tow mine with all four wheels off the ground,
a rollback or trailer
