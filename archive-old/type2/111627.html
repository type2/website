Subject: urgent AIRS assistance needed in Alabama

forwarded message from Rob Henley (72camper_dot_com)---

----------------------------------
Well Spiffy broke down in Alabama. He has a big problem. I am not a mechanic, 
but I told James to take off the valve covers and as feared its not good. 
He said the spring retainer on the #2 valve was laying in the valve cover 
and the spring is twisted. The rod is &quot;loose&quot;. I am not sure what this means
except it sucks. 
Possibly a dropped valve? The #1 is fine as are #3 and 4.   
He is in Uniontown, AL just west of Selma, AL which is about 40? 
miles west of Montgomery on highway 80. If anyone can help please
 call me at 704 502-8927 or James at 281 935-7330. If nothing else 
he needs to find a mechanic in Selma or thereabouts.   
 
I am going to start 
calling the AIRS listees now.    Thanks!   Rob
