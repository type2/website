Subject: cold start and/or dumbness

Obviously, I have not been thinking correctly
so let me just act dumb:

If I have to floor my accelerator to get my
1978 FI (stock) bus to start and the amount
of cranking that is needed can vary from 0.25
seconds to 25 seconds without regard to whether
the bus is warm or cold, level or on an incline,
full of gas or on empty, in wet weather or dry,
with the electrical draw from the headlamps on
or off, before and after replacing all the fuel
lines &amp; filter, then my problem is __________. 

Note: cranking is strong, the battery is newish,
and, once running, it is a sweet engine that
has no known problems, knock on wood.

As I say, I have somehow wandered down some
garden path so I am beginning again at the
beginning, including assuming that I know
nothing and therefore spouting no theories.

Yr humble svnt,
