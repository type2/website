I am spending the day trying to get my horn rewired until this winter =
when I can redo my wiring.  I'm not getting any power from the existing =
wire (no spark) so I thought I'd just run a separate wire and did so, =
and still no spark.  Do I have a short or what.  The fuse box is just =
hanging and is not in a bracket, would this make a difference?  Should I =
do the Muir short test with the battery ground cable?  Any suggestions =
would be appreciated.
