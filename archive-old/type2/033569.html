Subject: RE: off-topic: best bus

Folks,

Best bus discussions can go on and on.  Years ago I had a 62, now I have a
72.  They are light years apart in technical development, comfort and power.
And while the splitty maybe the quintessential VW design, our bay windows
are pretty in their own right, every bit a part of VW history and culture.
Besides that - they are a lot more comfortable!

Granted, I don't have a 2.0 engine, so I don't know the power I don't have -
but I have to tell you that my engine runs smoother than any upright around.
This is not only my opinion, but the opinion of several dyed-in-the-wool
splitty owners.  And, while my motor might cost more to rebuild, most
splitty owners are rebuilding twice and amost 3 times to my once.

I think the best year comes down to what you have in your garage.  You know
your bus.  You know its idiosyncracies...and you know how great it feels to
drive.  I was in at Wolfsburg West a couple of months ago, talking with one
of the guys and discussing how much money I had in the bus - and you know
what his response was: &quot;Not much when you consider what a cool ride you
have.&quot;  You know what?  He was right.

Take a look in the garage...that's the best year, because it's your's.

Take care,
Phil
