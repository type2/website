Subject: Re: Northern engine stand

&gt;The difficulty I'm having is getting the engine on and off of the stand.  My
&gt;floor jack doesn't lift high enough to reach the stand, and extra bodies for
&gt;lifting are hard to come by at the hours I keep.  I do have a chain hoist,
&gt;but I haven't figured out a good way of rigging a cable onto the engine that
&gt;doesn't involve a lot of gymnastics I would like to avoid.

Years ago, I built a &quot;sling&quot; that would lift either a type 1 or type 4
engine using the hole at the front of the engine behind the flywheel
housing and the bolt that is above the belt pulley at the back of the
engine (front as in front of the bus, back would be the engine lid end)

The &quot;sling&quot; is mearly a 2&quot; square piece of tubing about 20&quot; long with a
short piece of chain welded to the center that we hook our chain hoist to.
Welded to each end of the square tubing is another length of chain about
16&quot; long, then a short piece of flat steel welded to the chain with a hole
drilled in it.

To use the &quot;sling&quot; just put a bolt through the hole in the engine, then
through the hole on the flat steel.  On the back end of the engine, just
remove the nut, place the flat steel over the bolt, replace the nut.
Tighten the nuts, hook to the chain hoist and lift.

The chains give you the flexability you need to get the engines on the
stands.  You can lift the type 1 engines with or without the upright tin
and the type 4 engines complete, or stripped.
