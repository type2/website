Subject: Re: Hardwood floors in a westy

I put some fiber board under the plywood in mine and it raised the
other interior components enough that many of the alignment holes
didn't line up anymore.  It's quiter, but I did have to drill new
holes..

Of course a few days after installing the new floor (and cleaning
up any rusty areas) I had a 2 liter bottle of coke burst and
disappear into the floor.  I can only imagine what it looks like
down there now..

&gt; O.k. this is coming from left field, but I've read about a few others who
&gt; have seen it done.  I would like to put oak hardwood floors in my 71 westy.
&gt; I have the entire rear interior stripped out right now, and have a bunch of
&gt; oak and plywood left over from doing the floors in  my house.  It seems very
&gt; possible to attempt it but I have a few Q's.  Will the height of the
&gt; subloors, and oak combined cause a disturbance with the bed and tall cabinets
&gt;  Also,  I would seal all the wood including subfloor before puttting them in,
&gt; but will moisture still be an issue?
