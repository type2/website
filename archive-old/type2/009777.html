If your Bus was lowered with one of our adjustable beams, you simply need
to reset the adjusters located in the center of it and then re-align the
suspension. Make sure it is off the ground when you do this.  If it was
lowered by removing some of the torsion leaves (the wrong way), then you
will have to replace the missing parts.

Thank you!

&gt; I recently bought a '71 camper and the person who previously owned it
lowered it (God knows why....).  I want to raise it back up to stock
height.  Any advice about doing this would be appreciated.  What parts will
I need?  Are any special tools necessary?  Does anyone who has raised a bus
have any advice?  
&gt; 
&gt; Thank you all in advance
