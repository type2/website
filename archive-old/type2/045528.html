Subject: re: [T2] Hydraulic lifters for '75 1.8...question

It was written: &quot;I hope not to have to split the case, and hadn't
planned a cam changeout unless absolutely required. Here is the question
(at last): Is this an
absolute rule?&quot;

Check the archives.  If you can't find it, write me off list.

The short answer is that you can just pop the new lifters in with the
regular cam, push rods, and rocker arm springs, and it'll work just
fine.  Many have had success with this.  But why spring for new lifters
if you are not going to use a new cam?  Setting valves is not that big a
deal.  Save that $$ for the real problems you *will* have, I'd say.
