Subject: Corvair style air seals

Howdy all. Anyone know where I can get my greasy little paws on a set of 
Corvair style spark plug wire air seals for my ' 78 2.0L Westy? I know I'll 
have to modify them a bit, from reading Hoover's story in the archives, but I 
have no idea where to start looking for them. Tried my local FLAPS, and they 
laughed in my face. Of course, I first had to explain to the pimply faced 
child behind the parts counter that Once Apon a Time the General Motors 
Corporation actually made a car called a Corvair,(&quot;...with a six cylinder Air 
Cooled engine in the back!!???...No Way Dude!&quot;) but what can you do? Any help 
would be great. And I won't even go in to telling you what happend when I 
tried to tell this kid who Ralph Nader was...
Thanks,
Parker
