X-Diagnostic: MESSAGE REQUIRES APPROVAL - A

&gt; 2) I am in the process of removing my starter, does anyone know where the 
&gt; 2nd screw is that I need to take off to remove the starter? I got the 
&gt; electrical part off as well as the screw under the bus. But I cant find the 
&gt; 2nd screw.

You didnt mention a year but.. the upper starter bolt has a nut behind the
engine it has a half moon shape thats held captive against the starter.
Its also the Upper Passenger side tranny to engine bolt 

&gt; 3) There is a part that looks like a black can that has a few latches on it. 
&gt; It has two vents that face towards the back of the bus. It also has a tube 
&gt; that runs to the top of my carburetor. Can anyone tell me what this is? I 
&gt; would think it was the air filter but it has quite a bit of oil inside.

oil bath air cleaner. yes

4) Last question for now. Newt to the oil cathere is a pipe that runs down 
&gt; under the bus to nowhere the other part of the tube attaches to a hose that 
&gt; goes to the part described in question number 3.

Sounds like crankcase breather venting. Is it right for your bus the way
its set up? dunno?
