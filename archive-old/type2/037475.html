Subject: Re: electrical connectors for FI engine

Since the dealer says no parts older than 1980, tell them to get off their
lazy b*tts, check a cross reference manual, and order you the connectors for
the 80-83.5 Vanagon fuel injection.  I'll bet they are exactly the same, but
perhaps others can confirm this.
