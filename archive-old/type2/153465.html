Subject: Home done frontend alignment

I was just told that Canadian Tire couldn't do the alignment on my 70 bug
because they didn't have the specs. I can't imagine an easier vehicle to do
one on, so thought, what the heck, I'll do it myself. I seem to recall you
could do one yourself with a tape measure. Has anyone done one lately and
remembers the procedure? I posted it to the type 2 list as well, because the
front ends are the same design.
Thanks,
Courtney
