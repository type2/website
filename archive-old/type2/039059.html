Volkswagen has built the upright, horizontally opposed engine for 62 years,
in
that time, they have done a lot of research and development.  Volkswagen
did not put a traditional filter on their motors until the days of the Type
4 motor.
If you are doing proper and regular maintenance on your Volkswagen, you
should not need an additional oil filter.  Instead, look for what Volkswagen
used
from the start--a fine mesh oil strainer, and supplement that with a
magnetic
oil drain plug or ring magnet on your drain plate.

The newer, aftermarket oilstrainers are very coarse (too large openings) and
do not serve much purpose except for blocking large chunks of broken motor
from getting sucked back to the system.  The correct strainer is really
fine, and
would have a firm, yet silky feel when you touch the screen.

As for the magnets, you can either find drain plugs which have a magnetic
tip,
or find a ring shaped magnet which will circle around the drain opening in
the
round steel plate on the bottom of the motor.  This will attract and retain
any
filings which happen to make it to the oil stream.

As for synthetic, the only thing I find it to be useful for is cold weather
starting
at temperatures below 0 degrees Fahrenheit.  Aside from that, the oil still
holds the dirt/contamination that it would if it were not synthetic.  Yes,
it does
not break down as quickly as normal oil, but it still carries the byproducts
of
internal combustion.  For simplicity sake, I change my oil every 2,000 miles
with my Beetle and my Bus, and have not had any problems with either due to
the oil in the engine.  The best advice on oil is to use good quality, but
not to
waste your money either.

Another arguement against the use of synthetic oil is the molecular
structure
of synthetic oil.  The molecules of synthetic oil are smaller than molecules
of
&quot;natural?&quot; oil.  Because of this, synthetic oil will have a tendency to leak
more
than normal oil.  Anyone who has had a VW for any period of time will tell
you
they happily mark their spots, why encourage it?

That's my .02, FWIW,

Subject: Oil filer or no? Opinions?


&gt;Hi,
&gt;
&gt;We got our '68 Westy this past January which was suffering from some
&gt;maintenance neglect. We pulled the engine which has 53K original miles on
it
&gt;(sat a lot). We had the heads rebuilt and we're replacing seals and
gaskets,
&gt;etc. We aren't doing a full rebuild.
&gt;
&gt;My question is whether we should put an oil filter on the engine or just
&gt;wait until the rebuild and have the case bored for the full flow filter?
&gt;Without the full flow I would have to use the oil pump cap with the two
&gt;fittings with a line to the oil filter. I was told that this set up
wouldn't
&gt;have much flow so it's not worth doing.
&gt;
&gt;So, should I just go with NO filter at all? Is there a significant (worth
$$
&gt;and energy) benefit to using the non-full flow oil filter as opposed to
&gt;nothing at all w/ doing the oil changes? We planned on using synthetic oil.
&gt;
&gt;Thanks,
&gt;Jen
