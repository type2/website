Subject: Re: [T2] Those hard to find digital oven thermometers

Try Edmund Scientific at http://www.edmundscientific_dot_com

&gt;As the subject states I have yet to find a digital oven thermometer anywhere
&gt;I have tried Radioshack, Walmart, Canadian Tire, Zellers, and some specialty
&gt;kitchen shops.
&gt;
&gt;Any ideas ????
&gt;
&gt;or does anyone know exactly where to get one in there home town I could
&gt;make it worth your while to pick one up and ship it to me
