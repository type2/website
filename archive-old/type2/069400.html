&gt;starting action.  Both &quot;red&quot; and &quot;green&quot; lights came on - turn the key -
&gt;click - nothing.  Of course I didn't have Muir with me, left him in the
&gt;apt cuz I was reading up some stuff recently, but I did remember the
&gt;thing about the starter being &quot;stuck&quot;.  Tried pushing it back and still

     Uhh. I don't see it mentioned, maybe you overlooked it, but how 
about bump-starting? Just get it rolling a little (easier if going 
forward but can be done in reverse), put it in 2nd (or reverse if going 
backwards), and drop the clutch and hit the gas. Should start great, if 
there are no engine problems. If it's the venerable &quot;old wiring&quot; problem, 
a jump start might cure it as well. See the archives for numerous 
postings on how to fix the old wiring.

&gt;So, I'm looking at Muir and guess that tomorrow I will examine the
&gt;starter/solenoid. Any tips?  Should I buy any new parts (starter?) to

     If you do need a new starter, shop around at the big boys. 
Occasionally you get lucky with them. I got a rebuilt from PepBoys (in 
California) about 3-4 years ago, with a lifetime warranty, cheaper than 
anyplace else-around $40 if I recall correctly. Thing conked out on me 
last september, I pulled it out, went to PepBoys (in Texas), got another 
rebuilt. At this rate, I can keep replacing it every time it breaks, no 
problem. I don't think the folks at PepBoys were counting on me keeping 
this car for longer than the life of the starter...  ;-)
