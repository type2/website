Subject: Re: of benches and buckets

&gt; but if a bench seat bus is built to stop the
&gt; bus from twisting, what is done differently for our bucket busses to stop the
&gt; twisting?  

I thought of that, and I bet there's some sort of extra reinforcement
bar that runs along or under the floor in the walk-thrus. Plus, the
floor is flat since the spare tire well is in the back; maybe that has
something to do with it. I noticed that a couple of horizontal bars had
been added in one of the splitty mods (from bench to bucket) mentioned
in the archives. I'm curious what the official response will be.

No substitute for the original, though. Now I've decided the upside to
having the bench is that not only is it conducive to displays of
affection, it will serve as the couch to sleep on if I get mad.
AcCENTuate the positive.... :-)
