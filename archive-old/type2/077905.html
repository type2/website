Subject: Re: [T2] Driving with sliding door open, is it legal?

&gt; Hello list,
&gt;
&gt; I just had a quick little question. Is is illegal to
&gt; drive your bus with the back hatch up and /or the
&gt; sliding door open? I know that this is probably a
&gt; topic that is handled differently from state to stae
&gt; but I wanted to see what you  would say. Would driving
&gt; around with the bgack hatch up mess up its hinge
&gt; springs? Thanks!

Not sure about illegal, but I was always told not to drive with the sliding
door open because it puts stress on the wrong areas of the bus and can
damage the body structure.

True or not?

I'm not sure, but the guy who told me usually knows his stuff, so I always
close it now just in case.

Tammy
