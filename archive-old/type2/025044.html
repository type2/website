&lt;&lt; It's a fact. Gas for my type-2 bus now costs just over $4 per gallon. Over
 the last 2 months gas prices have been raised on 12 occasions. Strangely
 enough diesel has not increased. The oil companies here blame it on a very
 high demand for gas in the US. Thanks guys .... ;-) &gt;&gt;

 Actually the price in Europe is much higher in Local Money , the US Dollar 
is very high now, I have paid $5 US for regular gas there in years past,  the 
dollar is at 2.5 guilders now, a few years ago it was 1.60.....

so in Holland it is almost $1 a liter.....3.85 liters to US gallon

Most of this is tax, one day years ago (1993)  Germany added  one  D-mark a 
gallon tax OVERNIGHT !   , thats was 60 US cents a gallon added tax in one 
day !!!!
I filled up at 11:20 PM at the old price........

At least you can drive across Holland in a few hours.......
