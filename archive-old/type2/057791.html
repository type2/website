&gt; I have a 71 Westy, and after I drive it the engine is red hot.  The
dipstick will peel the skin off of you hands.  All the engine tin
seems to be in place, and the seal is there.  I checked the alternator
belt, and it was tight.  I don't have an oil temp. gauge, so I am not
sure of the temp, but it is pretty hot.  Any suggestions of what else
to try?  

Is the cooling fan blocked?  Insulation fallen against the intake on
the front of the shroud can play havoc.  You might also have a piece
of paper or somesuch sucked into the fan itself.  Put on some dirty
clothes and get intimate with the engine so you can feel around in
there.

Other things to check is the cooling flap position (pushrod in front
of shroud should have a spring on it that pulls it to the left).

Make sure that the belt is properly tensioned and that the fan is
secure on its shaft.

Check your ignition timing, too.

Let us know how it goes!
