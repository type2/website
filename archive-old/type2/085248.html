Subject: Clutch-self-destruct-mode...

Hey everyone... so...
    (1970 panel bus)  The other day, Friday, I was at work, and I went to 
leave to run some errands..  I was going to back out of the parking space, so 
I was all ready to go, pushed the clutch in, put it into reverse and then all 
of a sudden it jerked backwards...  I was stomping on the clutch petal, and 
it went to the floor with no effect.. then, the car stalled...  It felt like 
the cable broke, but when I checked it out, the cable was fine, the linkage 
was fine...  I was able to limp it back home without using the clutch..  When 
i press the petal, it goes to the floor, and makes a whirring, almost 
grinding sound..  
    I figured it has to do with either the throw-out bearing, the pressure 
plate or the little pivot arm.  My mechanic said the same thing..  I didnt 
want to do the work myself, so im taking it to the mechanic.. does  $250-300 
sound about right? too much?  i added the parts up, using RMMW, and for the 
clutch, pressureplate, bearing, clips and arm, it came out to about $130, so 
i guess 150-ish in labor sounds good?
    It was a hassle driving the 20 miles home on surface streets.. Thinking 
about it now, it probably would have been easier on the freeway, cause the 
only tricky part of driving with no clutch is when you have to stop...  It 
was kinda fun though...
