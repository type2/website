John:

There's a process about which I have been curious for some time, but
have never taken the trouble to investigate.  Their web page is for
selling franchises for this process, but perhaps if you contacted them
they could put you in touch with someone who actually does this
procedure:

I'd love to see it in action, just to see how it works, whether it is
truly effective, or whether it's a ho-hum idea.
