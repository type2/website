&gt;Are there gaskets used on the spacer blocks for the intake runners? There
&gt;was not any on the original engine or in the gasket kit, but Wilson calls
&gt;for them.

Gaskets are integral on the phenolic blocks, either red or green paper,
or the better ones black graffoil.  I typically use a bit of nanhardening
sealer
on the ones with paper, the graffoil is great as is.  Don't goop em up with
silicone.

&gt;The engine has two left heads, i.e. both have the socket for the heat
&gt;sensor. What is the proper thing to use to fill the hole on the right side
&gt;and to secure the tin?

Something M10x1.0, its a hard thread to find.  A real good solution, use
an old head temp sensor (you should replace the real one just for safety
anyway) and if you can track down a diesel or early waterboxer coolant
cluster clock, that and a $0.20 LED makes a swift head temp gage and
the LED in the gage will even go off around 400F.  This is a REAL good
thing to have for a Vanagon driver.  Another solution you might have
around, 2.0 valve adjuster screw and nut, also M10x1.0
