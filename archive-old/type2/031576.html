&gt; &gt; Hello list and all auto tranny lovers.  Can the transmission be pulled by
&gt; &gt; itself without motor?  Or is it easier to pull as a complete unit with
&gt; &gt; motor?  Thanks, Mark
&gt; 
&gt; You have to pull the transmission with the engine.  Won't come out
&gt; otherwise.

Auto tranny engines can and do come out alone, do it all the time, the
auto tranny doesn't have the long power shaft so it doesn't have to be
pulled back any more than needed to clear the studs on the bottom of the
engine.

there are three bolts that are accessed through a small hole in the engine
that remove the connection to the torque converter, at this point the
engine only needs to be pulled back about an inch to clear the tranny.

only thing is be sure the small oil pump shaft for the tranny does not
come out with the engine, sometimes it will. it is free floating so just
reach up in there and push it back into the transmission.  this shaft is
only about as big around as a pencil so don't put too much presure on it.
