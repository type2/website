Subject: Valve Noise Redux

Hi all. Thanks for all the responses. Sorry, but I am not able to
personally respond to all of you, but it's the end of school. They actually
expect us to study!!!

Anyway, many of you mentioned that adjusting your valves but turning the
engine backwards was they way to go. So I did just that. The noises I heard
before were some _really_ loose valves. I'm talking about 1/2 cm! So I
obviously messed it up setting them valves while turning the engine
foreward. I guess all the other ties I did it, I was just lucky (it happens
sometimes ;-). Adjusting them all again made everything groovy. I turned it
over two more times, just to make sure it wasn't going to pull and
auto-magic adjust on me again. One gets tired of adjusting valves three
times in a row!

Sean Bartnick mentioned:

&gt;You did properly set the engine to TDC on the compression stroke each
&gt;time, right?

OK. I'll admit, I don't know when the compression stroke occurs in my
engine. While turing over my engine, I did hear one compressions stroke,
coming either from cyl. 3 or 4. But never from 1 or 2. Is they an easy way
to find this out, or is it a listen careful and don't loose count kinda
thing. If it is, I'm OK with that. On that note Marv Krupp wrote:

&gt;Chris, you absolutely sure you have correct TDC for each cylinder as you set
&gt;them? Remember, crank goes around twice for every cam revolution.

Isn't the dizzy running off the cam? So if the rotor is aligned with its
correspodning mark for cyl. 1-4, would compression be at that point?

&gt;If it ain't the valves, it is the plugs.  You pulled them.  Did you
&gt;retighten them?  Loose plugs make the SAME noise as loose valves and also
&gt;the same noise as an exhaust leak.

I checked the plugs again to see if I screwed up. They were all tight.
Obviously  it didn't make any difference in this case, but I still have a
little noise from my valves/exhaust. I suppose an easy way to check would
be to hold a mirror up to a cold, possibly exhaust leak and see if any
water condenses on startup. Or a piece of paper.

Closer inspection of the noises seems to put the noises in the area of the
valves. So it's possible they are always going to be noisy. Does anyone
else in the Type 4 engine arena share this opinion?

Thanks again for all the help. Your a warm bubbly buncha folks!
