Subject: [T2] RE: Thanks for the Advice &amp; I spoke too soon ( a little rant about UFLARS)

After having problems with my bus dying on me with no warnings and then 
starting the next day and running fine for a day or so I finally had to have 
it towed to a FLARS, or maybe UFLARS.  I mentioned that a few people had 
said that my coil was incorrect as Bentley states that for electronic 
ignitions such as my '79 2000 FI bus has that I should only have a special 
coil, part # 211 905 115 C.  The shop put in Bosch coil part # 221 122 023.  
They said it crosses over to the VW part #. The bus ran great for 100 miles 
the next day and fine the day following that.  Then yesterday, it died as I 
rolled slowly to a red light at a busy intersection.
Needless to say, it was nightmarish.  I couldn't leave it where it died as 
it was a no parking zone and thankfully a nice lady stopped and offered her 
cell phone.  I was able to call my road side assisstance folks(who are 
getting to know me on a first name basis now).  Thankfully my 4-yr-old was 
there to play me some blues harp while we waited for the tow.  Same problem 
as before. No sputtering, engine tries to turn over but won't catch.  I have 
gas, I have a new coil, I see no loose wires or connections.
My battery was dead when I got home because the tow guy left it turned on 
after getting in and driving me forty-five miles.  So, I have been charging 
it all day and as soon as it is charged, I will try to test my double relay 
switch which was the other thing people suggested.  I only wish the shop 
guys would have looked a little further into my problem while I had it 
there. I should have never told them what I thought the problem was. Not to 
mention I stupidly did not ask for my old part back which is probably fine. 
I know it wasn't leaking anything.  Thanks for letting me rant.  I feel 
teased terribly after spending money on a shop repair and then driving so 
well for two days just to have the same problem come back.
So, double relay.  If the double relay is bad, would I still be able to 
start at all?  I ask because after a day of sitting, the bus starts fine and 
if I only go short distances it runs fine.  It starts every time, first try, 
aside from the cold morning starts, then it takes a few tries.  I guess the 
relay could just short out when it gets hot or something like that, but then 
it seems it would happen even more frequently.  Any FI Bus wizards in 
Northern Utah want to come over for coffee/tea and a little electrical 
troubleshooting training?  I think I am about ready to give up trying to 
figure it out myself.  Okay, I am going out now to try and follow the 
Bentley guide for dual relay testing procedures.  I will let you know what I 
find.  Thanks for being here.
