Subject: [T2] Wheels Offsets - Thank You!

I wanted to write and thank all of you for the huge response I got from my 
question. I sent my question to several lists that I subscribe to that 
relate to a variety of cars I have an interest in. I tried to keep the 
subject general although I would not have been upset if someone had written 
and told me the part number of the wheel I want! &lt;grin&gt;

I tried to keep the question general so the information would not be too 
far off topic for each list.

The short version of what I am trying to do is take my '78 VW Westy camper 
van and run 15&quot; plain Jane wheels on it. The factory saw fit to equip it 
with 14&quot; wheels and I don't like the small wheel look and I would prefer to 
have less side wall than the 14&quot; wheel offers. I don't seek to change the 
final gear ratio.

Several folks advised me that AUDI and VW PASSATS would share wheels with a 
same bolt pattern but two problems arose with that - the vehicle weight and 
the wheel offset they use. Too little and too much - in that order.

I refuse to use spacers and wheel adaptors because they are very expensive 
($150 per axle for one quote - direct from the manufacturer. (He told me to 
be careful, these were for light duty use only - I have to wonder what 
light duty means to a daily driver vehicle like mine...) and I don't trust 
them for my family's safety. I also can't restud these hubs without placing 
the new studs between the old holes and thus between the strengthening 
webs. The hubs are pretty small so anything larger than 5x120 or so 
wouldn't fit anyhow (on the front hubs). I don't want to weld on the cast 
iron hubs since the only safe way that I was taught in welding class 
involved pre-heating and post heating the hubs. Cracks here are BAD!

This leaves me with custom wheel shops who can build me wheels to specs, or 
taking a wheel like a basic white spoke wheel and having it drilled to the 
right pattern from the start. Since one requirement of my project is to 
allow my wife to buy food for us once in a while, this isn't an option 
right now.

Tire Rack and their cousins were of little use. Some of the sales folks 
told me that they had no offset and center bore charts to check against. I 
could hang up and call right back and get another salesperson and they had 
a chart. I could get no one to just glance down the list and tell me which 
model had a wheel that was the closest to my needs. This was after they 
confirmed they could sell me dealer take offs/replacement steel wheels that 
the snow belt folks like to buy to run their snow tires on. I could buy the 
wheels I need for about $25 each - I just have to find out which model 
Mercedes - and be pretty sure about it.

The local tire stores didn't have any lists to check so I guess I'll have 
to either make a trip to Chattanooga to the local Merc dealer with a VW hub 
or spend alot of time on the phone with them. Hope if I say VW they don't 
turn into snobs...

Some VW listers said Mercedes wheels should work fine. Yes but as I found 
out - Mercedes made 30 different models (or more) of their cars and most 
had different wheel specs. They did make some lighter cars whose wheels 
might be pretty flimsy for a van though.

Fortunately, the heavier models use the right wheel so (I think) it will 
all work out. Unfortunately I live in Cookeville, TN -- a little west of 
BFE -- and if you look closely at the city limits signs -- they proclaim 
our fair city to be a registered &quot;Rusty Maverick Hell&quot; reserve and that all 
import drivers/owner beware! Needless to say if it wasn't built in SE Asia 
or North America there won't be many of them in the junkyards here. 
Consequently the junkyard owners think that these parts are worth a little 
more...

(Once I actually had a local fellow tell me that VW Bus parts are very rare 
so engine cooling tin is VERY expensive... Told him, thanks but I guess I'd 
just buy the parts new mail order.)

By the way, Cookeville is a haven for old Corvairs. If you know the right 
people - you can get anything!!! (I even know where an OEM '0' mile Corvair 
engine is - still strapped to the pallet.)

I've rambled enough - I just wanted to write and thank you all. I finally 
know the difference between offset and backspacing. I just have figure out 
which model of Mercedes applies to my situation. I can't just run to one of 
the local junkyards and start trial fitting wheels.
