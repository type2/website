Help!

My saga with the VIN No continues, I just came back from Highway Patrol in 
Dublin, CA. The officer I was assigned could not find the VIN No and refered 
me to another officer for whom I have to schedule another appointment and 
she was not in her office today.  DMV said I could go to any HIghway Patrol 
Unit so I called four more offices.  All of these offices are backlogged til 
July for VIN No verifications and I was told by Highway Patrol that they 
will not see people outside their area. When I said I only had a temp permit 
for May an officer said I could get an extension without additional charge 
but since DMV said I could go any Highway Patrol and I cannot, I doubt 
thevalidity of his statement. DO YOU BELIEVE THIS STORY!

I cannot get on the chat page at vanagon_dot_com, it says I need java browser 
downloaded and nothing happens, my laptop is very old so I don't know if it 
has java.  Plus, George, my 1980 vanagon is aircooled not water cooled and 
your type2 webpage says this is the page I should write to for help.

When I first bought the vehicle I contacted some type of VW registry so Im 
going to track it down.

I haven't started scraping off the undercoating yet to look for the VIN on 
the rail. So if anyone out there has an answer, I would greatly appreciate 
your help.

Cheers,
Janyce Bartlett
