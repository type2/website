Subject: Multimeter

Volks,
Haveing noted some comments on the list by some about
not knowing how to use a voltmeter I thought I might try something.
  I am putting a page up at my place to give some
basic multimeter usage info to those that have not
used one. here  is the URL.
&lt;&lt;&lt; http://www.geocities_dot_com/MotorCity/Speedway/1974/volts.htm &gt;&gt;&gt;
  I would like someone out there who doesnt know how to use
a voltmeter to check it out and let me know if it makes sense. If
not let me know why.
Also, any of you multimeter experts can critique it for me too.
If you have some cool tips send me the text direct and I will stick
your techniques up with acknowledgements.
                    Daniel Axel Simmons
