Subject: Rear Hatch Door Inside Handle?

One of my fondest childhood memories is laying stretched out on the back
luggage shelf of my parents brand new '64 Deluxe on the way home from some
camping trip.  The warmth and soothing sound of the little engine just
beneath me was very comforting-I couldn't hear my parents arguing.  No
surprise I like sleeping in my 71 Westy.  But, one of the things that has
frustrated me every since then is not being able to get in and out of the
back hatch door.  I was always the last one to get out when we stopped at
McDonalds to get our 15 cent hamburgers!  

I thought of putting a handle on the inside so that I could pull the door
closed once I'm in, but I still wouldn't be able to get out.  Sooooo, I took
the latch mechanism off and noticed there is a bar in it with a hole that
looks like it was made for an inside door latch/handle.  I can't think of
any other reason for it.  Was this ever offered as an option, or on non-US
models?  I understand the child proof aspect of having a door latch there
but, a kid should be buckled in anyway (thank goodness my dad didn't feel
that way back then).

So, obviously not having enough to keep me busy this weekend, I made an
inside latch/handle for the rear hatch.  The handle part acts like a safety
cover so that it could never be opened accidentally.  It's about 3.5 inches
wide, 1.5 inches tall, and only sticks out 1 inch so it doesn't interfere
with the mattress pad.  Didn't have to ruin any original parts either.
Works great.  If only I had it back then..........

Just a funky idea.
