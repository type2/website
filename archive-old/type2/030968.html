I've tried it, didn't particularly like it, but it did work

&gt; Anybody else remember a post from someone who said that gasoline goes
&gt; straight through your skin into the bloodstream?  If that's true it's a
&gt; wonder I don't explode walking past smokers.  Do petroleum and similar
&gt; solvents make it through the latex at all?  What about the old oil and
&gt; rubber problem?

no petro chemicals do not go &quot;right into the bloodstream&quot; but they are bad
for you, and breathing the fumes aren't too good for you either.

the petro chemicals do shorten the life of  latex gloves especially gas,
usually I will change em after getting gas on em, the other greases etc, I
usually get em too dirty to use or want a soda (beer) long before they go
bad.
