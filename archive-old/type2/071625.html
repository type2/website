Having been to vanfest i purchased a blower fan from a trader there , this
fitting onto the heat exchanger and into the y piece cutting out the heat
tube. When i first switched the blower fan on i had loads of gust up front
from the warm air and this was at stand still idling engine speed, great i
thought until i travelled about 10 miles and the heat got quite hot and the
fan suddenly stopped. On stripping it out i found the fan had totally melted
inside, rang the trader who gladly sent another saying it was the first time
he had had one melting. Anyway fitted second one which dually melted ,trader
refunded money gladly saying it was first time he`d had a problem with the
blowers. Great idea works fine until the heat melts the plastic fan.
Just wondered if anyone out there had sucessfully fitted any type of fan to up
the gust of the warm air up front, as i would be very grateful to find out
where i could buy a heat resistant blower from and talk to anyone else having
this problem.
yours ever hoping
