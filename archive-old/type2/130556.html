Subject: Timing out and other stuff like that

I cannot tell you how many times someone has posted a problem and I 
have thought: I remember when I had that problem, but it was so long 
ago that I can't remember how I solved it.

There are two bits of good news in this, and one bad.

First bit of good news: Eventually you'll solve whatever problems are 
bugging your bus, time will pass, fewer and fewer things will go wrong, 
and eventually you'll forget the trials and tribulations.

Second bit of good news: Every problem I have ever had with my bus I 
have solved (a) with help from this list or (b) by fiddling with 
something until it worked. Of course, (b) sometimes required that I go 
to the boneyards for a part to replace the one I damaged by fiddling 
with it.

The bad news (not bus-related): Could be that I have forgotten how I 
solved a problem because I am getting senile.

But I'll bet that for every reply to the list about how to fix a 
problem, there are ten people who don't post because they've long since 
forgotten how they fixed the same darned problem.
