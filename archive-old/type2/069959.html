Subject: Re: Platinum plugs?

T2s need to use BOSCH W6AC plugs because the engine works harder and hotter 
pushing the load of the bus.

Maybe I missed something in this thread, but the heat of the plugs refers to the 
operating temp of the plugs tip; its ability to shed combustion heat and maintain 
a temp below the point of spontanious combustion of the fuel.

&gt; &lt;&lt;I have heard, though, that platinum plugs will stick in cylinder heads and
&gt; will become nigh on impossible to remove.  (They last tens of thousands of
&gt; miles (in a healthy engine)&gt;&gt;
&gt; 
&gt; That's one of the reasons that VW suggested to remove them at the intervals
&gt; they specified, not doing so leads to frozen plugs and stripped threads...
&gt; Unfortunately... The only experience i have with the Platinums is in a
&gt; Japanese 4x4, result: hotter, flat spots, when we put the NGK (or
&gt; Nippon Denso, i don't recall) back all went back to normal. I would
&gt; never use anything other than stock Bosch W8AC, or W175T, or was it W275T,
&gt; don't remember, I've had *bad* experiences with Champion L88, L87 and L86, NGK
&gt; and Nippon Denso in aircooled VWs, for me: Bosch for German cars, NGK or
&gt; Nippon Denso for Japanese cars and maybe Chapion for Detroit Iron, i thought
&gt; that the American engine use plugs with huge gaps... I also don't like
&gt; Champion's packaging, if you drop one you can be sure that the electrode
&gt; bends, Bosch and the Japanese use carton tubes to protect the adjustments,
&gt; I never had a bad out-of-the-box Bosch, i did have quite a few Champions
&gt; and one Nippon Denso that just shorted or whatever they did to prevent
&gt; the cylinder in which they were mounted from doing its job.
&gt; A modified engine may require a colder plug, use Bosch W6AC and see if
&gt; it still burns clean properly.
