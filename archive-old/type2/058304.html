Subject: Cam battery connectors

Re connectors for rotted old battery ones:
Hi thyself to WalMart and look in the Auto (battery stuff) section.  You
will find replacement clamps of a cam style which are simpler to unhook and
have a wire connection similar to house service wiring connectors- you
insert the cut, cleaned stub of your old wire (I run a electric wire brush
over it and also tin the ends with solder, using a torch and solder) into
the hole of the connector and tighten down a very big screw.  This readily
lets you and an extra wire for accessories or adding the secondary battery.
I  consider the terminals that look like your old one to be inferior to the
cam action ones, which let you easily dissconnect without all the fuss and
body contortions usually required.
