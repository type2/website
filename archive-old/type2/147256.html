Subject: hot air tube under the bus

I thought I would take off the long hot air tube that runs 3 or 4 feet 
long under the bus and insulate it.  The tube is pretty much shot and 
needs replacing.  Does I need to use some special tubing designed for 
such applications, or can i get something like a dryer vent or similar 
plastic tubing of the right diameter?
