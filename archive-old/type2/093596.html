&gt;I've been told by one vendor and a dealer that this

&gt;plugs are the same as the 1600's. 

I believe the original plug had a plastic washer that it reusable? I bought some washers along with a strainer and other items then found I didn't have a copper washer there. I believe what I have is original. Maybe someone can confirm this for both of us. 

Go to the junkyard yourself. They are lazy.
