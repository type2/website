Subject: RE: [T2] Cylinder Head Paint

I didn't think about that. I have painted only watercooled engines. Thanks for that valuable insight. I am always glad to be corrected, makes me want to keep learning :)

&quot;For general info, paint is a pretty darn good insulator. The cylinders are
an integral part of the cooling system and are designed to have air flowing
over them to remove heat from the pistons.

Gonna be hard for the air to do its job when the heat is trapped under
&quot;multiple coats&quot; of insulating paint.&quot;
