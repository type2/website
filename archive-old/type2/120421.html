Subject: Metal brake line length

I am a cheap S.O.B.! Therefore I hate paying shipping
costs on parts. Anyway, my FLAPS has metal brake lines
that are 20 inches long in stock.  I see from online
parts sources that rear metal lines on a 67 bus are
21.85&quot; long.  So, my question is:  can I get a 20&quot;
metal line to work or will that extra 1.85&quot; be
problematic?
To order the right lines from internet source, it will
cost me more for shipping than it will for the parts,
and I just hate that ;^)
