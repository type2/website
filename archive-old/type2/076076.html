Subject: Putting on Michelin LTX LT 195/75R-14/C tires...

Hey ya all-
Stopped by America's Tire Store this morning looking into getting Mich MXT's
as most have recommended.
Big problem, they don't have them anymore.
not in a 195 or a 205.
They did a little research and came up with the LTX as being the new best
choice.
Wanted to ring me up for all 4 right there but I said, &quot;Hey, let's hold on
just a minute here.  I have to ask the List first&quot;!
It must be a major ego blow to a tire salesman for a customer to put off
just to ask people he's never met and to take their collective knowledge
over his.  But I politely asked him how many miles he's put on these tires
in a type 2 in various conditions.  Of course the answer was zero, and
that's why I said I would defer to the &quot;collective&quot;.

Price is 89.00 per plus all the incidentals.  I can do that.  But I want to
make sure they are good tires for our application.
BTW: It's a 72 Westy, completely stock.

I'm on digest, but I know most of you reply in direct as well.
Thanks in advance-
