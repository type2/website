&gt;Every state (and presumably country) has procedures in place to clear

&gt;vehicle is questionable.

The only reason I can think of is if the vehicle you posess is not legal to
drive in the US, like say a Mexican beetle or a Brazilian type II.

&gt;With the theft problem that we have, should we condone a practice that
&gt;is likely to result in more buses being stolen?

I'm not saying I think it's ethical to sell VIN plates, but I think the
chances of a bus being stolen and having different VIN plates swapped in is
pretty remote.  Think about it - if the bus is nice enough to steal, it is
probably well known in the VW community already.  I don't see it happening
very often.
