Forget that--it's missing on #1 and #3. For some reason I keep confusing #1
and #2, even going so far as to replacing the wires in the wrong distributor
towers and wondering why the engine was trying to run backwards...

Evidently I am the target audience for Muir's &quot;Idiot Book&quot;

So it's #1 and #3 missing at low idle. The apparent culprit is an exhaust
leak at each cylinder, where the manifold bolts onto the cylinder. I
tightened the nuts to #3--it was pretty close to the prescribed 16 ft./lbs.
already. Can't get a wrench on the nuts to #1 (have to get a 3/8'' deep
wall, 1/2'' is too wide).

Is there any way to evaluate the heat exchangers for leaks, given that I may
have to remove them in order to replace gaskets? I'm thinking of filling the
exhaust pipes with water...

Also, I've read in the archives that certain aftermarket heat exchangers may
not fit properly. Is there any way to measure these things against a bona
fide spec once I have them off?
