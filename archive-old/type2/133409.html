&gt; I'd heard that all knobs were now essentially un-bannable due to the
&gt; Americans with Disabilities Act -- since some people actually need
&gt; them to be able to drive, making them illegal is an ADA violation.

well yes and no, if your drivers license has a &quot;restriction&quot; on it
requiring a spinner knob then they have to let you have one, or you get
one that will meet the requirements (like mine) the problem is that mine
will work on a VW bus because they don't have air bags, but in those
&quot;other&quot; cars that are newer the airbags and the knobs get in the way of
each other
