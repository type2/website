&gt; karl,
&gt;
&gt; what is your problem?
&gt;
&gt;

I don't have a problem.
People spreading false information and bullcrap have a problem.
Like I said in my last reply to Jake. End of discussion.
All of you guys can sort thru the piles of BS and spend big $$ for gold plated
crap. I don't need this. Have you noticed there in no reference to VW in my
email address? It means gold fever. I am going back up in the hills. It is nice
and quiet and peaceful there.
