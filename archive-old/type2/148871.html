&gt; also left the bleeder screws loose
&gt; in the cylinders so that the cylinders would fill.  After I was done, I
&gt; closed the bleeders and found that the pedal was nice and firm, no
&gt; bleeding required!  Some days I just live right!

Hello George  I have been bleeding brakes like that for years . You should 
still go around and bleed them just once anyway.    Later and have fun  Mark
