Subject: Re: Removing/reinstalling pilot shaft trans seal

Hi Jeff,

I've used this type of puller numerous times with the shaft still in place.
You do mangle the rubber when inserting the tool, but once it is in, you can
maneuver the point to the outside edge of the seal and it should pry out
very easily. (Unless it has been glued in with some really tough adhesive.)

God luck,
BIll

| Hi Bill:
|
| Have you used this type of seal puller when the input shaft is still in
| the seal? It would seem that the puller is too big to fit.  I practiced
| last night with an idea from Scott Lyons on a seal in an old bellhousing,
| and had no luck at all. After tearing the seal up pretty good without any
| luck, I then  tried to pound out the seal just to get an idea of how hard
| it is pressed in. I now have just a torn up seal still in the old
| bellhousing.
|
| So I really need to either make a good seal removal tool or to find the
| correct version before I try it on the good transmission. Anyone have any
| other good ideas?
|
| TIA
