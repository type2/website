Subject: Re: [T2] chains (Don!)

Don - It wasn't for YOU! You already know about
chains.
I used to have both fronts chained on my WW2 jeep in 1
minute flat (I was 17 years old at the time !) It
takes me about a half hour now with the bus - with
time out for warming up and resting. Didn't need
either back then!

Here's one for you: What do you do when you've been
driving in rain and puddles, go up into freezing
weather and park for 4-5 hours and start your bus...
only to find that the brakes have frozen to the drums!
Keep in mind that there is about six inches of fresh
powder snow atop a sheet of glare ice. Oh - one more
thing - peeing on them is not going to be allowable as
it's a &quot;family&quot; parking lot. Oh - and no, the parking
brake was not set - nobody's that stoopid! -Busahaulic
P.S. Chains required on I-90 and US2 east of here as I
write this.


&gt; &gt; Really long description of installing chains
&gt; procedure
&gt; 
&gt; Wow. It took longer to read that than put them on.
&gt; =)
&gt; 
&gt; I got really good at chains when I lived in Big
&gt; Bear, CA. Regardless
&gt; of the vehicle or tires, unless it's 4x4 you have to
&gt; have chains as
&gt; soon as one flake hits the ground. Stupid laws.
&gt; 
&gt; BaH is right, though. And I still keep a set of
&gt; cable chains in the
&gt; Guac for when the cops make me use 'em. Though
&gt; they'd disintegrate in
&gt; minutes on the Nokians since the tread lugs would
&gt; rip them apart.
