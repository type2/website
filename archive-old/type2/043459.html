Subject: Brake servo question

My first attempt at carburetor adjustment was less than stellar. My bus
stalls at lights now (she's with the pro getting the carbs adjusted and
synchronized, after getting the exhaust leak fixed -- the window gets
installed in there somewhere). My question is: I noticed when she stalls
that the brakes get really hard to push, like power brakes when the
engine's off. Is this a normal result of the vacuum connection to the servo
not being active with the engine off, or is it a sign of a problem? It only
happens when the engine stalls.

P.S. The German window seals I picked up at WCM today *do* look a tad bit
leaner, so I'm optimistic.
