Subject: [T2] Type 1 Oil Cooler on Type 4

&gt;Will the smaller, rectangular-shaped, Type 1 1600 oil cooler fit
&gt;a Type 4 engine (same rubber gaskets and bolt locations?

I'm sure you have some good reason for this modification, and having
made the opposite one ( type 4 cooler on a type 1 engine ) i will say
Yes, it has the same dimensions, except it is 3/4&quot; thinner , having two
less rows of fins, and requires only the two corresponding thru bolts to mount.
The third bottom bolt is the same for both coolers.
