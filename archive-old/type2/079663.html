Subject: Road trip tomorrow...

Just a heads-up to any AIRS members on the east coast between Virginia and
the Gulf of Mexico...

I'm planning on driving from Springfield, VA to Orlando, FL tomorrow in my
78 Westy if I can finish the brake repairs I started on Tuesday.  I'm not
expecting to have any mechanical difficulties but as you know, sh*t
happens.  The bus is in great shape but the brake job is the determining
factor in whether I take it or not.  If not it'll be the Town &amp; Country
which is a better ride but just not the same.

So if anyone sees a dirty Champagne edition Westy on I-95 or I-4 in FLA
tomorrow, honk...it's me!  On that same note if anyone sees a dirty
Champagne edition Westy BESIDE I-95 or I-4 in FLA please pull over to help.
:)

Later,

Bob J.
