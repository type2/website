Dear List Members,

I too think its perfectly healthy to drool over your bus. If you've
noticed it's always me typing the messages and not my husband. Of course
we both drool over all our VW's, but GUNTHOR is special. He is our first
and our baby.
I have to admit I wasn't sure about this whole VW thing when we first
got into it but now I'm the one who reads ALL the messages from the
list.
I love getting dirty and working on the bus and knowing that I fixed
something.
And here's the best part of all, for all you guys out there. On MY
BIRTHDAY I asked my husband if we could go to the junk yard in another
town because a friend of ours told us they had 2 buses on the lot. I
told my husband he was very lucky. How many wives want to go the junk
yard on their birthday.
Keep up the list and remember it's 36hp so just go ahead and pass.

Sharon
The mama of
Gunthor
Gert the Vert
Toby
and Willie the adopted water cooled rabbit
