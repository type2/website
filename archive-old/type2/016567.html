 &gt; I have a 1973 bus im putting a new engine into.  I want to use the

 &gt; better off with a 2.0 with FI.  I prefer carburetion, and since i've

upright,
 &gt; not a flat?  Any advice would be appreciated.

 Matthew:
 Personally I think it's a lame idea to put a type 1 engine where a type
 4 used to be. Witness the many engine swap sites (Scott Fraser's and
 others) that are doing just the opposite! Many parts have to be changed
 to do it satisfactorily. It is possible to find all these parts because
 the majority of European loafs had 1600 engines 73-79. These parts
 include: engine hanger bar and rear isolators, all engine sheet metal,
 air cleaner and bracket and connecting hose and I believe the trans
 input shaft is different (shorter pilot bearing length, someone correct
 me if I'm wrong). Also your gear ratios are going to be a
 little steep, but you'll have the trans apart anyway, right? I didn't
 think so.
 There are a lot of reasons not to change to the type 1 engine. In my
 opinion a type 1 engine in a loaf used in the US under normal
 circumstances is only good for 100,000 km (61k miles). A good stock
 17-18-2000cc type 4 engine should last close to twice that. In addition
 to the fact that some come with hydraulic lifters (78-79) and the rest
 are bolt in adaptable to hydraulics, type 4's all have alternators, all
 have bigger heater boxes, auxilliary heater fans, and full flow oil
 filter systems. I think you already have a much better engine. In
 addition in some areas you may have state inspection problems with an
 engine swap!
 I think your best course of action would be to rebuild your 1700 as an
 1800. Get new 1800 p&amp;c's get the heads cut for the larger size by
 someone who knows what they are doing. They should do a valve job with
 guides and new exhaust valves too. If you can find 74 or 75 heads, they
 have bigger valves than any stock heads (except 914 2 liters which are
 great if you're looking for more than 90 horsepower, but otherwise too
 much money). The carbs are a problem because the auxilliary idle
circuits are complex but when set up correctly, they have better
linkage, better air cleaners, and provide for thermostatically
controlled preheat better  than any California-bolt-on stuff made. If
you're going to drive your  bus you need this stuff, and unless you're
an engineer or practical genius with lots of time on your hands, it just
doesn't make sense to start from scratch! Your carbs probably have worn
shafts and bushings but there must be some specialty shops that do this
repair (list- know of any?). Also the pdsit carbs used from 72-74 have
removeable venturis that are a cinch to have cut larger with a lathe!
I've done this before and feel that there is probably 3-5 hp there with
a little work. So, there you have a 75 hp engine that fits in and will
last a long time!
 What more could you ask for? A Lexus V-8 maybe, but we'll talk about
 that later!
