Subject: [T2] fuel pump dying?

&gt;I have a '79 Westy with stock FI.
&gt;
&gt;Lately (recently) the fuel pump has started making a constant
&gt;whining/buzzing noise.  I can hear it quite prominently in the cabin, can't
&gt;really hear it too much outside because the noise of the engine masks the
&gt;noise from the pump.

Remove the fuel pump and drain the contents.
Examine for metal filings. These will contaminate
the injectors very quickly.
