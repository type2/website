Subject: canvas install-er-ing- help? bay area? bus depot

Hello,

Well I to ordered a replacement canvas from Bus Depot, except I ordered a
Yellow one and got GOLD instead. I didn't even see that as an option. I
don't care, I just want to replace it. The place that I was going to have do
it scares me a little too much to put faith in now, they are cheap, and say
they have done them before, but I have this gut feeling I better try and
stick with a bus expert on this one.

And with that note, this is my cry for help. I am going to try and attack
this project this saturday, I live
in San Francisco, and could use a little help. I'll be the first to admit,
when I need a tool, I have to go buy
it. I am slowly learning my bus, but am not the handyman I would like to be,
and could use the guidance and assistance of a professional. I can pay for
the help, time, beer, etc, if anyone in my area or driving distance has the
tools (I can always go get them) time, or knowledge to help out. Its a 76
westy that im trying to get ready to take to the grand canyon (to, if all
plans go accordingly, become engaged!)- so you can see the importance of my
getting it up and running. The current canvas works, as long as you don't
touch it, or move it in any way. My significant other tried to unzip the
screen on our last trip, and it just tore along the seam instead. (thank
goodness for duct tape!)

Or if you know of a place in my area that does do this kind of work for a
reasonable price, let me know also.

Thanks for taking the time to read this....

&gt; jeff,
&gt;
&gt; i did this very thing on wed and thurs...no help of
&gt; course.  i too received a gray tent...orange and gray
&gt; sound better to me.  feel lucky, i put my tent all of
&gt; the way to the top, it appeared to reach, and then i
&gt; went inside (since it was 11pm) to go to bed.  the
&gt; next morning when i opened up the top, the damn thing
&gt; didn't reach.  i got the back sliver to reach, but the
&gt; sides and front, however, were not going to reach.
&gt;
&gt; so, i spent all day on thurs. removing a plastic
&gt; strip, removing the staples, pulling the canvas down
&gt; (almost an inch,) retacking and then reapplying the
&gt; strip to 3 sides one by one.  it took me well into the
&gt; night to finish getting the bottom metal strip in.
&gt;
&gt; i agree with the lower the top a bit, fasten, lift.
&gt; that is what i had to do.  it looks great, but my
&gt; staple gun days were numbered towards the end, and i
&gt; have one spot to refasten...2 minute job.  i never
&gt; want to see a staple gun again.  my hands will hurt
&gt; for days.
&gt;
&gt; it only took 2 of us 3 hours to disconnect, drop, and
&gt; load our first engine...2 to put it back.  this canvas
&gt; better last...i sure don't want to do it again,
&gt; either!
