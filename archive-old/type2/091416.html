&gt; I've been dealing with various vacuum related issues and am trying to find

&gt; Is there a spec for this?

In my book, 15&quot; is a minimum at idle and I like to see 17-18&quot;.  I keep
finding different charts that show the different symptoms.  her's one from
GM, but they are all the same:

&gt; What is normal?

15-18&quot; of vacuum.

&gt; Should it vary over time (from startup to warmed up)?

Not noticibly.

&gt; I went out and got a vac gauge and got a wide range of readings, from as
&gt; high as 15&quot;Hg to as low as 10&quot;Hg.  Often, the reading would oscillate 2&quot;
&gt; (and the engine would speed up and slow down as I watched the vac reading
&gt; swing).

You have a vacuum leak.

&gt; Also, I can hear what sounds like &quot;sucking wind&quot; from the engine
&gt; compartment (maybe near the throttle body but hard to tell).

If this is FI, that &quot;sucking wind&quot; sound is probably normal, especially at
the throttle body. The way idle speed is set on FI is that a bit of air is
allowed to bypas the throttle butterfly and it does make a hiss as it
does.

&gt; I went ape and replaced ALL the small vac lines, some of the larger
&gt; ones, clamped all the larger vacuum tubes, removed and cleaned the
&gt; throttle body and reattached it with Blue RTV around the gasket (some
&gt; archive post mentioned possible leaks here).  Gonna start 'er up
&gt; tonight after the gasket maker dries... hoping for good readings!

All these sound good.  In addition, head out to a scientific supply store
or old-fashioned hobby shop (do these even exist any more???) and buy a
supply of rubber stoppers.  Stopper everthing coming off the &quot;big hose&quot;
and the air dist box (decel valve, brake booster, crancase vent, etc. etc.
and see if that helps.  If it does not, then it's the manifold to block
gaskets or the big hoses from the runner to the air dist box.  If it does,
start adding accesories one at a time until you find the one that is
leaking.
