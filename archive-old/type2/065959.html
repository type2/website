Subject: Painting small rust spots

        Bren,
        Your proposed recipe for dealing with small paint chips
is basicly what I follow, with pretty good success.

        1 Wire wheel, etc, to remove all actual rust. 
        2 Feather paint and primer around affected area. Use a sanding block.
        3 I use paint-thinner on a rag to clean-up last of dust, etc. 
Anyone have a better product to recomend?
        4 Mask outside of the feather edges

        5 I, personally, use Rustoleum spray and brush primers, and have
been quite happy with them. They make three kinds: 

Rusty metal primer- brown- for when pitting, etc, prevent bright metal base.
        Brown color is from iron oxide loading? Can someone explain the
chemistry of this?

Clean metal primer- greenish- for bright, clean, metal (zinc chromate loaded?)

Sandable Automotive primer- grey, may be wet-sanded.

        ALL of these may be sprayed from rattle-cans, BUT you must 
THOROUGHLY shake the can (3-5 minutes after the marble starts rattling)
after pre-warming it to 100 degrees F or more using a warm-tap-water-bath.
Bob Hoover and a couple of other people suggested this to me when I
was doing serious rattle-can painting on my '70 single cab.

        I, personally, use a Survivair breathing mask/filter system when 
I paint these days. I also wear disposable latex gloves. 

        I have pretty lousy luck cleaning out the spray can valves
and nozzles- about half my spray-cans clog-up OR run out of propellant
before they're empty.

        WARNING
        NO rattle-can primer is actually waterproof over the long term. 
The job of a primer is to give the waterproof paint something to adhere to.
Unpainted primer WILL NOT STOP RUST, unless its a catalyzed urathane
product or something else very fancy. There's thousands of old beetles
driving around with a fender, trunk or engine cover in primer where the
ENTIRE panel is turning red under the primer- you've seen this yourself.

        A professional body shop will use a slightly different product,
a 'primer/sealer' which both provides a surface for the new paint to
adhere to AND is a basicly inert barrier between old paint, primer,
fillers, etc, and the new paint.
        The latest generations of primer/sealers are catalyzed and
often a beige/buff color. They are as waterproof as the top-coat paint.
They require postive pressure breathing masks for you and a nifty fume
control system. They are not available in spray cans. A 'guide coat' of 
a darker brown or black is frequently splattered over the professional 
shop primer as a visual guide for block-sanding.

        6) With Rustoleum, you can top-coat withing 15 minutes OR you
have to wait 24 or 48 hours. Obviously you can't sand if you topcoat
within 15 minutes :) For minor rust repair I don't sand the primer,
I just shoot the top-coat. But don't try to do it all at once-
two thin coats with a day or two between them makes a much better paint 
job than one thick coat.

        7) You CAN sand between top coats but you have to wait for
the paint to dry and harden THOROUGHLY. Whatever the can says should
be regarded as a MINIMUM, and experiment in an out-of-the-way place.

        A friend has been building car models and getting amazing shines from
PlastiKote brank automotive paint. Shinier than my Rustoleum. It dries
hard enough to rub-out, which I've never tried on Rustoleum.

        Sorry this went on so long.

        Bill
