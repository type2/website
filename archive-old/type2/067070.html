Thanks to everybody who answered my question re. compression test fire hazard.

I'm off to the APS to pick up my Master Cylinder $68.00 with trade.
I will talk them out of needing the trade.  I managed to rebuild my 
1959 Chevy Impala without ever trading anything except batteries.  
It's anal, but, since I have storage space, why would I give up an original 
piece of a vintage auto, under any circumstances?

Oh well, I'll bug ya later!
