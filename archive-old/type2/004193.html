Almighty List,

OK..here goes..

I purchased a '70 Camper a year and a half ago and this list has been
essential to its restoration (Thank You).  Its coming down to the wire now
and my final task before certification is getting the brakes to operate
properly.

Here is what I have done..so far.

The bus had been sitting for about seven years, I filled the MC, bled the
lines and found that the rear cylinder seals were shot so I replaced them
altogether.  The front cylinders (4 of them - drums on the front) all seem
to be in good shape..no leaks, but after bleeding the lines again, the pedal
still went to the floor and I was still losing fluid.  So I checked out the
MC, no leaks? this can't be!...Then I removed the tin rusty tin covering the
pedal cluster and voila, brake fluid everywhere.  So, I removed the MC and
found that the front cup (seal...whatever) had shrunk significantly.  I then
found out that the '70 dual circuit MC is unique and very costly.  So I
search for a rebuild kit...checked local FLAPS..no luck, then by chance I
was standing at the parts counter at Canadian Tire (Crappy Tire..for the
other Canadians)..asked the 'guy' if by chance they had one..they didn't,
but after a few calls he found one in Winnipeg..only $44.00!  So, I rebuilt
the MC, reinstalled it, bled the lines again, and the pedal was still going
to the floor, I was not losing fluid anymore...but rather, I had bubbles of
air  rising up to the brake fluid filler reservoir as I depressed the pedal.
So, I figured that I had incorrectly rebuilt the MC, since I had only done
one other before, and pulled it from the bus again.  After checking with
Bentley and Haynes I determined that I added an optional spacer that came
with the rebuild kit that I did not require.  So, after checking that I had
not damaged the shaft of the MC...I didn't, I put it back together, checked
the ports and returned it to the bus.  I bled the brakes again (that's 4),
and now no leaks! no bubbles! but the pedal still goes to the floor, with
little braking power.  If I pump the pedal it will rest at about the mid way
point.  But If I release it the hit it again it almost reaches the floor.
The bus will stop, but I would not want to make an emergency stop..you know
what I mean.  After scratching my head and mumbling to myself for a couple
hours I wondered if I had adjusted the pads correctly.  I checked all four
corners and they were all correct.

So now what?

 I then jacked up the drivers side, both wheels, had a helper spin the back
tire and I hit the brakes slowly.  The tire stopped completely about an inch
into the pedal movement and could no be spun by hand about half way down.
Sound good?
I repeated the process with the front, but front kept spinning when the
pedal was half way or even further.

I think I have localized the problem to front brake circuit but I don't know
anymore.

Have I missed anything?  If anyone can think of any suggestions, tests I
could do, ANYTHING!!
I have sworn to myself (and to others) that I would that I would have
Caroline on the road before June.

Thanks for hearing/helping me out.
