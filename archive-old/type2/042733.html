rob: the steering box has an adjustment bolt- check the bentley.
if you have a lot of slop at the steering wheel , this can help-

jack both front wheels off the ground (use jack stands ),
grab the left front wheel and turn it sharply, you should be
able to see the slop in the drag link ( slight movement off-axis ).
have a helper do it while you look, after you get good you can do it
alone. grab the drag link and wiggle it hard to see, also. or put a vise-
grip on it and jerk it.  eventually you will find the play... it doesn't have to
be much to be bad, but you should be able to see it, failing that, have
your mechanic save it to show you, and try the feel on the new one
before he installs it...

wiggling the wheel up and down is a test for wheel bearings, and side to
side is a test for tie rods and other steering components ( drag link, etc.... )
