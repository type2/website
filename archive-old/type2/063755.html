Subject: 65 Deluxe FS but...

I went to visit a 65 Deluxe this weekend, with the idea that it would be
handy sometime in the future to have a VW van that was in the &quot;don't care&quot;
range regarding emissions.  This particular van is not the one for me, tho.
Very respectable van, never hit, 21 windows and the ragtop, from the top
down to about kneecap height.  After that, it is surprising that there is
anything for the suspension to hang onto.  They are looking for an offer
over $500.  Maybe someone could weld the top half onto a van that had been
rolled.  The sellers live in North Jersey, but they're from California?  So
every sentence ends like a question?  They also have a rough but complete
barndoor deluxe, which is a combination I hadn't seen before?  But that one's
not for sale? 

The 65 would probably be a donor for window glass and the jail bars and not
much else (oh- the dash had the original three-hole radio cutout, so maybe
that's worth something too) in California, but here on the east coast I 
thought maybe someone would see past the rust.  Phone number is 201-313-0572.
Tell them the guy with the yellow Vanagon sent you.  I guess we all have our
little blinders: they were surprised there was such a thing as a stickshift
Vanagon.
