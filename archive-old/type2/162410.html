Subject: Re: [T2] Fuel filter woes

There are two ways to fix the filler neck, none really easy or nice:

1) Pull out aircleaner/AFM assembly. Remove ECU. Remove round block-off
plate. Hope the hose clamps are oriented so you can get them off. Find
someone with monkey-arms to get in there to pull off filler. Have same
person put new one back in.

2) Cut the sheet metal to access the filler neck. Ouch, I hate to even
think of cutting, but I have seen several people do it. Have also seen
folks cut under the bed to access to top of the fuel tank. Ouch again.
But, once you have the cut, put on moulding and a hinge, and you are set
forever.

&gt; already know needs replaced. I suppose that's it. Sigh.
