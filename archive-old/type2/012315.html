Subject: MSHP Stage 2 (the autopsy results, LONG)
Mime-Version: 1.0
X-Diagnostic: MESSAGE MAY NOT BE TOPICAL

Well with the new 2.0 in the '82 running well it was time to break the
MSHP Stage 2 down and have a look around.  This is the super duper
$3000 engine Steve Dolan bought before his big trip 2? years back.  I
traded him a stock 2.0 I had rebuilt (also for this '82 oddly) last summer
when the MSHP was down to about 85 psi all round with 4 somewhat
lower.  The results I figure I'll post even though Stephens is out of
business, something I called would happen about 2 years before it did.
To be quite honest up front, this thing did a lot better than one might
have expected, it had about 30k or so, and still ran.  And sad as it was
it had more power still by far than the new 2.0 I put back in.  It had also
been overheated at least 2-3 times, and run lean its entire life till I got
the Digifant up and on it.

Crank.  Not badly done, welded 78mm counterweighted.  The welding is
satisfactory and the crank actually is still in useable shape (whoopee as
it is the major component I was hoping for.)  Some of it sort of shoddy
though, clearly never had that fine a polish, just whatever was left after the
fine stone.  Some pits in the rod journals from incomplete weld, but just
a few and tiny.  Also a whack on one like it was hit with file or something.
The real ugly part is the chamfers on the rod oil holes, sharp edges that
gouged 3 of the rod bearings probably on day one.  It took me about an
hour to polish it up, file the holes, smooth everything out and pack it away
for future use.  Makes you wonder why they didn't.

Rods.  The nicest piece of the engine.  A lot ground off em to clearance
the things, but a nice job.  Probably even new rod nuts (something some
of the other big T4 re builders still in business could blow the $5 for.)  I'm
probably going to put the Raceware stud set in so I'll need to get em
resized but they are still fine as is.  I know Craig had a rod bearing go in
his, I'd guess from looking more likely the crank and the oil holes trashing
the bearing than failure of the rod itself.

Cam.  Nice enough, showing nearly none of the regular T4 wear pattern.  It is
sort of pitted all over though.  Maybe a cast cam cast in final shape and not
ground would be my guess.  I've never seen one like that run but I'd guess
this
is what it would look like if I did.  About .290 lift intake a bit less
exhaust,
didn't bother figuring anything else.

Valve train.  OEM lifters.  Bug style custom length cromoly pushrods, new
or damn near new rocker shafts.  Pretty well done all round.  The neat thing,
1.7 rockers running elephant adjusters in the 8mm arms.  Something I had
been considering trying.  Required some shimming to work though and this
engine is nearly 0.4&quot; wider than stock due to the use of two 0.090 shims
under each barrel to use the cheesball stock pistons so it's hard to say
how all the geometry works and whether or not you could use em on a stock
2.0.

Case.  Could have been better.  Not bored and it probably needed it, I'd have
to clean it up to measure but by the fretting around the center main, I'd
say it
has been built 3 times at least now.  Still I'll give credit for it having
been well
cleaned, and tapped on most of the important galleys.

Oil pump.  This one peeves me.  A friggin over the hill, well worn, and I mean
WORN original pump.  The 30k on this engine didn't do this, it was gone
before it started, and the engine had oil pressure issues on day 1.  A number
of the &quot;quality&quot; T4 re builders do this.  It amazes me.  The T4 pump new seems
to have loads of backlash.  Although the bearing plate can be lapped with
effort
the body cant be.  A short style 3 bolt bug pump fits right in.  The T4
pump is
24mm gears, a quality OEM bug pump with 26 or 30mm gears will set you
back around $30 and $40 respectively.  $3000 engine, you figure it.  For the
2.0 in a pinch I got caught needing to use a used one.  You can tell how used
looking at the gears.  I had 5 and used my best and was worried about it, and
all 5 of mine were nicer than this pump.

Heads.  Well 42 x 36 as advertised, but not exactly 914 exhausts.  Bug valves
in 8mm guides all round.  Porting was actually nicely done.  They took a
lot of
metal out of these, all by hand, but the contours maintained were very nice.
But they knew who Dolan was too, as the heads are labeled with his name,
maybe a bit more attention.  The 1,2 side still in good shape.  The 3,4 side
well 4 exhaust has a big crack, and sunk seat, and severely pounded mating
surface but frankly it wasn't the heads fault.  The intakes nicely ported, not
much done on exhaust side.  The heads basically a lot better than I figure
they
would be.  59cc volume, a lot.  Mostly contoured into a kidney beam shape
around the plug sort of like, but more so than a real 914 2.0 head.  I know a
lot of people in the business mocked his head quality but this set at least
seems nicely enough done.  Again I wonder if all the hand work really was
worth it as you could have done it with a ball mill on a Bridgeport a hell of
a lot quicker, but whatever works and all.

P&amp;Cs.  Ahh, this is the failing.  Well they all look like 125k mile parts
coming
out of a 30k engine.  They are what I interpret to be Stephens infamous Asian
made parts.  Stock 94's.  The pistons are a treat.  To cheap to go through the
monstrous effort (or unwilling to pay the whopping $40 each) a nice KB piston
would have cost.  Somebody by hand whittled down each piston to clearance
the crank.  Making a home made &quot;slipper skirt&quot; style piston.  They look like
the guy removed 1/3 of the piston with a dull pocket knife.  I can't even
imagine
this was cost effective, and I don't care if he was paying somebody $3 an
hour.
They are all different and oddly shaped with various amounts of each skirt
gone.
But the real failing is the barrels.  I'm looking at that #4 head trying to
imagine
how the mating surface could have pounded the way it had, and I glance at the
barrel.  Now a regular 94 mating surface is about 1/4&quot; thick at the top.  Well
#4 was chamfered about 1/16&quot; inside and out, leaving a piddly 1/8&quot; ring
hitting
the head cutting into it like a chisel.  Utter junk, should never have been
made,
and CERTAINLY no competent mechanic would have installed that junk.  This
was obvious folks and gives a good look at the quality that came out of the
place.  ANYONE RUNNING A STOCK MS 2.0 WOULD BE AT RISK FOR THIS.
Worth considering.  If you got one and the compression is going down in one
cylinder, pull the head for a look before it is trashed too.  This is what was
putting the lid on the coffin.  The wear on all of them can go to the
overheating
and lean running, but #4 never had a chance at more than 50k worth of life.

Well my analysis is as such.  I bet these P&amp;C's weren't costing him $150 the
set frankly.  The crank was probably worth $250 or so, if I had paid him
the $500
or whatever he wanted I'd have shit when I saw it and sent it back.  The rods
maybe $100.  Cam to him $75 or less, same for the lifters.  The heads, well
that
is hard to say, I'm sure he had some labor in the things, lets say his cost
$250
each or so.  Anyway round I'd bet he had well under $1500 in each of these.
 Steve
paid about $2500 for the engine and $500 for &quot;assembly.&quot;  Frankly it amazes me
Mark went out of business at that kind of profit margin, he must have been WAY
in debt on all those Asian P&amp;C's and machine tools if he couldn't make
money on
these things.

It goes to the old thought, build it yourself, you care WAY more about your
engine than anyone else does.  If anyone wants a look at the parts to glean an
idea of how to build something themselves, I'll take pictures.  My solution is
going to be a bit more eloquent as the 95.6mm KB's I bought allow this stroke
to be built without shimming the barrels.  I was $40 each into the pistons,
$100
into Rimco for boring the barrels, and $100 into rings.  A bit more than a
stock
set but also 95.6mm   And actually these were an uncommon pricey set of
pistons and rings.  They make a very nice piston for less that could be had in
95 or 95.6 mm with a 12cc pocket that would go perfectly in a stock stroke
2.0 with very minor shimming, probably .060 or so all round.  If anyone has a
square port Stephens Stage 2 head out there used in useable shape, I'm
in the market BTW.  I have a set of new German round ports for FAT to work
over but if I could find a square I might just keep throw it back together and
keep the '82.

Anyway as always.
