Subject: RE: [T2] Paint Removal

Little late on that one, from what I've done so far I
let it dry on the floor and sweep it up in a pile to
throw away.  I figure once the bus is done the garage
will be ready for a good cleaning.  On the flip side
the cats figured out real quick that stuff wasn't a
good substitute for kitty litter!

&gt; throw down some plastic in that garage if you can. 
&gt; Concrete is
&gt; basically a big sponge, and acids and other caustics
&gt; leave nice
&gt; little stains in the concrete that you won't be able
&gt; to get out with
&gt; any amount of ease.
