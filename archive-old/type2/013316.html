Subject: [T2]Front Brake lights on 72 Westy???

Hi all,

Rudy, my 72 Westy is acting rather strangely in the electrical department since I had the engine swaped for a 2ltr FI set up.  A few days ago I began to notice that at stop lights, when I have the brakes aplied that the front yellow 'parking' lights come on. The back brake lights are just fine. This is in broad daylight without the headlights on.  Is this normal behavior that has taken me this long to notice? I've only had the bus for 9 months and it's my first air cooled ever.  I'm just checking to make sure this is normal or not before I try to to fix it. One thing to note is that the current battery is in dire need of relacement. I have a back-up ready and waiting. But that wouldn't seem to have any conection to this 'problem.' This just seems strange to me to have the these front lights come on when I hit the brakes. It doesn't make any sence to have designed it this way but I don't knoe that the VW folks didn't.

If anyone knows the anwser to this question could you please let me know. Thanks.

Rae Borough
Rudy the 1972 Westy (2 ltr w/FI)
