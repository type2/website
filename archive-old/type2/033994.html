Subject: Moisture problem now frozen

Hello All,

Thanks everyone for the info on the moisture problem that I have been having 
with my 81' Vanagon.  I took it out for a nice long run two nights ago and 
the problem seemed to ease up.  With the cold snap that we are having up 
here in Wisconsin, my van is all froze up.  This morning I couldn't get it 
started and wore the battery out.  I'm going to put it away for the winter 
and get it off the salty streets up here, at least until I get a chance to 
get away for awhile.  Thanks again for your help,

Eggman
