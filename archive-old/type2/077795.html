&gt; if you put the wrong dist on an engine you would still set the static

&gt; &gt; lucky, your severely oveheated engine would die on you around Salem, VA,
&gt; &gt; so that you could have it towed to Mark Deering's shop to have the engine
&gt; &gt; rebuilt.

and the moral of the story, make dern sure you have a temp guage and a
timing light!!
