  &gt; hehehe.. my friends were making fun of me because I recently decided 
not
&gt; to move to the colder mid-west because I didn't want to have my bus be 
&gt; in an environment where they used salt and it would damage my body.
&gt; 
&gt; My boss made a joke as if I were married:
&gt; 
&gt; imaginary wife: &quot;Mike, why don't we move to ......&quot;
&gt; me: &quot;I'm sorry honey, I just don't think that would be ok for the bus.&quot;

I might add... My friends think my priorities are nutty.. I think otherwise!

I've grown up my ENTIRE life w/ either a 76 or 78 bus; it's part of me. 
  Heck, my parents even had a couple before I was born.  Superbus 
(that's my bus' name) must live on!
