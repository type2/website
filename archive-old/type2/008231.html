    Anyone have any recommendations for a good body shop near Cambridge/Boston
    MA?  I have a '73 Bus that needs his nose banged out, rockers replaced, and
    a decent paint job.  I would take him to Maaco for the paint and nose, but
    would like to have someone familiar with VWs do the rockers.  I'd do it
    myself but I have neither the space nor the tools.  One day I will, but in
    the meantime?
    
I've used two, they both can do rockers but they did not inspire
overwhelming confidence.  Tech Auto Body in Union Square, Somerville,
has a old bus sitting on the curb as its show piece.  I had a ton of
rust knocked out there five years ago plus a paint job and have been
relatively diligent since, except I couldn't seem to protect the
rockers.  Cambridge Auto Metal on Franklin Street in Central Square
does rust work and rehabs of various sorts.  New rockers at the latter
joint plus fabricating almost all of the bottom edge of the slider cost
$850 to a primer finish.  They use Duro Extend on all the inside stuff
that won't get painted, but I don't know how permanent that is.   One
of their guys is a champion welder, that much I'll say for 'em.

Also, take a look at http://web.mit_dot_edu/johnbowe/www/bbn-auto/
which is the legendary BBN Boston Area Auto list, wholly venerable
and dating back to FTP and VT100s at least.  My pal John Bowe takes
care of it as a fifth generation lighthouse keeper, God bless him.
I'm copying the whole list to recommend that other locales copy
what I'm talking about.
