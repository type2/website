BN4 Heater For Sale

Still in bus which was restored by previous owner. Fully connected so I 
assume it has all the parts. I havn't tried to start it because I have a 
fear of gasoline and know it hasn't been started in at least 5 years.

It is in a 1969 Westy.

Make an offer! (I know what they usually sell for.)

Eric
