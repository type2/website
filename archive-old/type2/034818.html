Said George Lyle:

&gt; Actually, the best antenna is a quarter-wave on 11m, which is a
&gt; straight whip 108 inches long.  This is 9 feet long, and unfortunately
&gt; when you put this on top of a bus you end up with an overall height of
&gt; 15 feet, a bit more than the 13-1/2 feet allowed.  This is why I
&gt; recommend the 6 foot helical Firestik.

I've seen the 9-foot whips mounted on rear bumpers or even low on the
side of a bus (e.g., near the rear side marker lights), which keeps the
height down.

&gt; 
&gt; Now _that's_ an old call!

Yeah, I remember when the CB craze hit ant FCC got swamped with license
requests, so they just told everyone to use their initials.  I still
have my license somewhere but it's probably expired - I think they had a
5-year term or something like that.

And David Scharze added:

&gt; If I had a Westy, I would use a good mag-mount antenna on the roof inside
&gt; the luggage rack.

My old 68 Westy had an antenna (permanent mount) in the same spot --
stupid place for a permanent mount (had to load the rack around it), but
I like David's idea.
