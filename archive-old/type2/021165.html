I'm posting this to the list also for comment after suggesting to Dean
Aukes that a fellow I know swears by filling the engine cavities
completely with oil, it can be kept  years.....
Dean responded:
&quot;Interesting suggestion.  A few years ago I read about a
Beechcraft Bonanzaairplane that was being restored.  It had set for many
years in a hanger after the owner had passed away.  When the new owners
checked out the engine, expecting the worst, they found that it had been
overfilled with oil in a major way and was very useable after an oil
change.&quot;
     It occurred to me that the Type4 engine has the breatherbox on top
that's easy to remove- and then you can fill the large hole.  Yes, to
keep it from leaking out the valve covers or exhaust ports, the valves
can be kept closed by pulling the rockers. But then it would be
difficult to turn it over by hand to ensure free movement?
Not sure if oil can reach the valve guides to prevent galvanic reactions
between dissimilar metals; George Lyle, any comment?   The point of
filling with oil is to also remove any possible moisture condensate
(air) also and prevent corrosion. MB 78 Westy
