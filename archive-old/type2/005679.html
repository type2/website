ive had the same prob on all my VWs here in AZ. After a long hot trip: click
click. The way I do it is to have a helper rock your bus forward and back IN
GEAR, while you keep bumping the starter with the key at the point the
tranny engages and the wheels lock. Bus doesnt go anywhere, just rocking
basically. Takes a couple tries usually. The flywheel sort of &quot;frees the
starter&quot; if you will, so I know its heat related. Then when the starter
becomes operational and your bus stutters forward in gear due to the starter
magically working, stop rocking, disengage the clutch and start it normally.
Tried many different starters including self supporting in case there was a
binding issue on the starter shaft..... No difference. I'm BANNED from
taking back my lifetime warranty starters at the local FLAPS. Tried 5 before
they told me to get lost. Im using new wiring, new starter, new battery, new
tranny to ground-ground strap, new battery to ground-ground strap  -Still
locks.
This method sure as heck beats push starting for a mile in 120 degree
weather or getting underneath on the scorching pavement. Ive tried the hot
start relays, still doesnt do much except eventually blow the fuse on the
relay. I can &quot;bump free the starter&quot; by myself in a bug fortunately (foot
sticking out on the ground, rocking it back and forth). Will click all day
unless i bump it free. Maybe ill try the heat shield...never thought about
it.
