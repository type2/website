Subject: solvent

hi all

what is a good solvent for cleaning oil/grease off of and out of a case
and/or engine parts?  i have my engine almost completely disassembled, but
lord is it dirty!  i tried some sort of solvent that had a chemical reaction
with my rods (formed some crystalline substance on them) and killed at least
one layer of skin on my hands b/f i used gloves.  i didn't like it.  can you
recommend?

thanx
paul
