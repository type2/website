Subject: odd sqeaking sound?
Message-Id: &lt;199907111725.NAA18947_at_lenti.type2_dot_com&gt;

I have a general question, I hope it isn't inappropriate for this venue.
My bus, a `74 transporter with a safare camper aftermarket  package, had begun 
to intermintently sqeak while driving. The sound is with almost no doubt 
coming from my front end, and happens only when straight on with the wheel, it 
seems to have been sparked by some bumpy asphalt. My brakes are solid, the 
steering has had no apparent change in feel. I've looked at my grease fitting 
thinking I'd give them a going over, it has been at least two years since I 
greased them. The bus sat for a year, I didn't think it was neglect to not 
grease the sitting vehicle. Tell me if I'm wrong.  Does anyone have an answer 
for me? Please email me directly.
