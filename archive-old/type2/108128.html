Subject: Re: [T2] Fuel In oil

How far do you drive each day? If you only drive short distances the engine
does not have time to fully warm up and burn off the excess fuel in the oil
from the rich start up. It could also be leaky injectors or worn rings
although, if it were worn rings you would most likely also see some smoke
from the engine. I have this problem from only driving short distances and
just change the oil at more frequent intervals. 1500 miles or so instead of
3000.
