I've done a fair amount of desert driving now and
it necessarily involves quite a few flat tires. 
I can say that the worst thing in the world is
having to jack up the vehicle to get the flat off
the ground, plus jack up the vehicle in the
location of one of those darn under body mounts,
and then crawl under the #&amp;%$!#^* truck to get
the darn spare.  Never would I purposefully add
this feature to any vehicle.  It's fine for
soccer moms who call AAA for their flats and
nothing more.  

That being said, I don't think I've changed a
flat on a bus in a decade or so.  But even the
thought of the spare under the vehicle make me
grit my teeth.  :)


Happy bussin'
