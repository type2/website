Subject: Re: Oil/additives?

With 60K on the engine, I began using TUFOIL additive back in 1985.
This is a PTFE additive that touts lower friction, lower temperatures, and
better milage.  At first use I did get higher rpms and better milage (about
2 mpg).......Now at 196k (same unrestored engine; only changed muffler and
heater boxes, lifters, and one clutch disk) I average 139 lbs compression
and got 20 mpg on the trek to the Woodstock show.  I swear that that by the
vibrations I feel/hear in the shifter handle that the engine will outlast
the trans!!!!!   Hope to make it to  Busses by the Bay, Md.
