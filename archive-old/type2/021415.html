Kevin:
This is not rocket science. The original problem is what is referred to as hot
start syndrome. Look it up in the archives. Bad connections, grounds, weak
starter, and switch may all contribute.
If your battery is not holding a charge, it can be tested with a load tester.
The charging system can be verified by a simple voltage test (needs to be about
13.5-14.0).
The alternator lite needs to be functional for the alternator to work. If the
bulb is not there or hooked up correctly, the system likely will not charge.
I'd be a little concerned about service at a shop that  just keeps changing out
parts.
They should be able to hook it to a few testers and show you what's wrong in
about 1/2 hour.
