Subject: Re: [T2] removal of heads

If you have a pancake engine you can do it without removing the engine 
quite easily.

For the seals call Bus Depot.


&gt;i need to replace my valve seals and push rod tube seals.  i am wondering if
&gt;i need to lower or remove the engine to remove the heads and also what
&gt;gasket(s) will i need to purchase before i start?  another thing--i was
&gt;reading the article   &quot;Hydraulic Lifters and Type IV Pushrod Tube Seals&quot; by
&gt;John Anderson from the type2 library and i was wondering where i can find the
&gt;Viton seals that he mentioned.  This is what he suggested doing:  &quot;Do the
&gt;same to the bores over on the heads. Install Viton o-rings with silicone
&gt;grease (or at least oil) and those tubes won't leak again.&quot;
&gt;one more thing, does anyone know of one supplier that could get us all of the
&gt;above-- the Viton seals, the gaskets needed for the head and valve seals?
&gt;any help would be appreciated.  thanks, michelle
