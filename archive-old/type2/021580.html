Yeah, I just wanted to make sure that correct engine was in the bus. 
From the fan shroud, it is, but the owner could not find the other
number.  I found it on mine, and told him where to look.. he's gonna try
again..

But yes, he does have the triangle flanges..

later,
Mike

&gt; &gt; WHY not just look through the windshield in the drivers front corner and
&gt; &gt; check the official serial number stamping...
&gt; 
&gt; Because as I understand it, the question was about the year of the engine,
&gt; not the year of the bus.
