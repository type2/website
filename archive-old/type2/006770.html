Hey folks,
My parents garage is filled with vanagon parts and they want them out!  All 
parts came from my 3 owner, 104k mile '80 vanagon daily driver that got 
broadsided by a careless driver.  Here's what I have:
* 2 liter F.I. engine, hydraulic lifters, newish heater boxes and muffler, 
runs great and smooth and cool with no major oil leaks, would like to sell 
complete including all fuel injection components, alternator, exhaust, tin, 
etc. for $600
* complete westfalia interior, beige cabinets, fridge/sink/stove, 
reupholstered sofabed, fits any year vanagon.  doesn't include swivel seats 
or poptop.  $500
* complete 7-seater interior, brown vinyl, excellent condition.  Best Offer
*boxes and boxes of miscellaneous trim and interior parts, e-mail me with 
needs.  Please respond to ag264098_at_oak_dot_cats.ohiou_dot_edu
Open to trades esp. parts for early bay window buses, upright engines.
Thanks,

Andy
