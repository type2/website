I had a 69 hard top westy a while back that was original that i snagged 
the interior out of.  Jack Maynard actually found it for me.  You still 
out there Jack??  Anyways, it was complete and original and had the net 
in the back.  I took the net and popped it into my 71 bus.  I really 
like that thing, better to get tangled in it when you wake up than bonk 
your head on a cabinet!!
The 69 i took it out of had a little wood panel on the roof though just 
in front of the hatch to attatch the rear part of the net to though,,,
