Subject: Re: [T2] Horn decided to start honking at the police today. :-)

Courtney of the Commonwealth quoth:

&gt;all of a sudden my horn starts intermittently honking all by itself. 
&gt;It had previously not been honking half the time when I pushed on 
&gt;the horn button

	This reminds me of a cartoon c.1951 of that notable American 
D Duck esq: drives into a garage and tells the boss &quot;jack up the horn 
and run a new car in under it  -  it's the only thing that doesn't 
make a noise.&quot;
