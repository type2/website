Subject: looking for specific bus model

At the last two VW shows in our area I saw a boxed model of a circa '71 bus, 
metal I believe, white on green, probably 6 inches long, box had a clear 
front, was a hard top, and the price was around $35.00... It matches my 
white on green hard top '71 Westy. Would anyone be able to send me a 
description of this model? Ended up spending my $$.$$ alotment for used parts 
at both shows...

Thanks

Greg
