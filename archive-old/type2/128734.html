Subject: AIRS UPDATES: (Was Re: [T2] Hi all - long)

Hi Volks,

This topic reminds me of a campfire conversation at the Dixie Bus 
Gathering.... Someone there had need of the AIRS list only to discover 
that about 80% of the phone numbers or email addresses in the state 
they were in were no longer active.

Too few people are making the effort to remove themselves from the list 
and over the years this has compounded to reduce the accuracy of the 
list. With over 2000 members added over the past 5 years it's not 
unreasonable that it would be time to do an audit.

Is there a way that the list can be verified? I don't want to cause any 
massive headaches, but if the list is full of dead entries it's not 
going to be very helpful. I'd suggest that an email go out to each airs 
list member asking them to verify their info. If no response is heard 
within a month, then that entry should be dropped from the database.

I'd rather see a small and useful AIRS list than a long list with 
useless information.

Happy trails,

Greg Potts
