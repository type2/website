&gt; The &quot;engine-in-a-box&quot; that came with the '72 had a decent pair of
&gt; heat exchangers. I understand that these will bolt right up to
&gt; the '77, but that I'd need to use the earlier exhaust with these.
&gt;
&gt; Does anyone out there know why this might be a bad idea? Has
&gt; anyone done this (fitted early heat exchangers and exhaust to late bay)?


Actually, it's a very good idea.  Original style '72-74 exhaust systems are
relatively inexpensive and of very high quality.  Original style '76-78
systems, on the other hand, are no longer available, forcing you to buy an
aftermarket system of inferior quality.  Anyone replacing heat exhangers and
exhaust on a '75-78 bus would be well advised to replace them with the
earlier style, just because of the exhaust system options it opens up.
