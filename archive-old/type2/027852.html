I'd like to know more about a heat shield too.  Apparently the heat is what 
killed my starter this weekend.  The weather here in Western Washington has 
been pretty toasty of late.  Putting in a new starter today; just about 
split a gut pushing the bus uphill so I could roll it back down for a bump 
start.

Thanks to all who responded to my 1st request.
