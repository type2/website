ive always had good luck with radios in my 69 westy.  the best advice i
can give is buy something thats high powered.  youre filling a large
vehicle with sound.  get something with at least 15 watts per channel RMS.

ive been seeing pioneer cd players going for about 175 dollars new around
here.  try walmart, farm and fleet, even rex.  you might have to grind
away a little of the metal on the edges of the mounting hole, but it
shouldnt need much. i dont have a cd player personally, but my friend has
one in his f*rd and that damn thing doesnt skip ever.  and he ditch rides
a lot.

right now, ive got a kenwood high power tape deck, 2 3 1/2 inch speakers
in the dash where the 6x9 was, and a pair of mtx 8 inch road thunders
between the front seats.  i mounted my amplifier behind the passenger
seat, and it has a 10 gauge power wire coming directly from the battery.

total cost for this system new was about 400 bucks.  and it sounds good.
you dont really need the speakers in the dash, but i had them in there
from a previous radio.  plus the mtx's came in their own boxes and make a
good console between the front seats.
