Subject: Re: [T2] Engine stall

&gt;I have been experienced some problems with my engine. Up hills, in the high
&gt;revolution zone and starts is very difficulty. I decided to check the electric
&gt;system and when I plugged the dwell meter to the coil terminal that comes from
&gt;the dizzy, the engine hesitate badly and almost die, then back to idle
&gt;normally when I unplugged the meter from the coil.

Sure it isn't a carb full of debris and dirt so that you &quot;run out of gas&quot; 
when you have the gas pedal on the floor?

Consider testing the condenser and points for failure...
