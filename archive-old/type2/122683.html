Subject: Re: [T2] Parts list for a '74??

On Sat, 22 Nov 2003 07:47:18 -0800 
Karl was heard babbling something about Re: [T2] Parts list for a '74??:

&gt; &gt; Does anyone know of a COMPLETE part number list for a '74 -- 7
&gt; &gt; passenger? Something in electronic form would be nice so I could
&gt; &gt; flatfile it in Excel for sorting and searching. I want EVERY part
&gt; &gt; number (with as much description as possible) used on my bus.
&gt; &gt; Gerald

&gt; My best suggestion would be to get the EKTA parts CD and study it. The
&gt; pics in it are like these:
&gt; http://www.bug-bits.freeserve.co_dot_uk/ramva/fiche/t205300.gif  but you 
&gt; also get text to tell you what the part number is for #20 etc. BUT the
&gt; bad part of it is: if the part is no longer available, then it says NLA
&gt; and you are screwed.....
&gt; Karl

Hmm -- I think I screwed up that request with too much info. Ask any of the
Buskatiers, I don't write often, but when I do it's usually too much
&lt;grin&gt;.

I'm not really looking for an assembly manual. And I don't need the latest
supercession part numbers. Hopefully if I start loking for a part that has
been superceeded the vendors will have the latest part number.

I am NOT restoring this bus to factory original. Having been a marine
electrician for 10 years I don't much like the way the wiring harness is
set up so that's all going away and will be beefed up, fuses replaced with
breakers, etc. H4 headlights, replacing external marker/turn/brake lights
with sealed LED units. Paint nowhere near original. Custom, hopefully
removeable/changeable, passenger/work/camper interior.

I'm looking for just a list of part numbers/descriptions. Is the text
section of the EKTA REGULAR text, or &quot;pictures&quot; of text pages? If it's
plain text I should be able to rip out the parts I need to at least get a
good start on my own database.

When I'm done with the bus I intend to have a &quot;parts manual&quot; unique to my
bus so that when I need to replace something I can look up the part number
and email it to Ronnie or go punch it into the Bus-Boys web page.

For now I need a list of part numbers for doing things like R&amp;R of the
front beam and other driveline items under the bus. Need part numbers for
ALL rubber items on the bus because EVERY seal is being replaced.

A list of secrew/bolt/nut sizes used would be nice, but that's pushing it.

Any items that were '74 unique I probably won't need. I don't need anything
directly engine related at this time -- There's a Raby engine sitting in a
crate waiting for me to finish the rest of the work. Engine before body is
a multi-page story that would get me moderated for &quot;chatty&quot;.

Like I said, I'm trying to get a parts list together so I can  prioritize.
My work schedule is REALLY odd and I'm working with no garage to work in. I
tow the bus to work with me and do a little on it if work is slow. Then I
tow it back to a 10x20 storage unit when I'm off. No room to work in the
storage unit and really no place to work on it at home (yet).

I set a &quot;list&quot; of what to do next. I haven't done anything in months
because I decided that I need to get the engine/tranny out before I do any
more on the body. When I have had time to pull the engine I haven't had
anyone available to help me lift it into my truck for transfer to storage
-- when someone's available, I don't have time...

OK -- I'll stop, I'm doing it again.
