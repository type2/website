Subject: Re: [T2] Which years had O2 sensors?

&gt; I'm trying to identify what year an instrument cluster I picked up at a

&gt; gauges).  It has an O2 sensor warning light instead, and I can't
&gt; remember which years had that.  Anybody know?

1979 California buses had an O2 sensor.  Many of the later buses had the
lamp in the cluster but no O2 sensor.

                             OOK!
