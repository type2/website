Subject: Re: [T2] Side view mirrors

I had my mirror glass fall out when I closed my door one day.  It
appeared to be held in only by the gray plastic, which had fairly
sizable pieces missing out of it.  The mirror cracked, but didn't
break.  I ended up goop'ing it back in.

My mirrors have been oriented long-side horizontal as long as I've known my
bus.
