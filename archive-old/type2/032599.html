Actually, this sounds more like it, as I am getting precious little airflow
at the windshield. If the cable is gone, and the flaps are set incorrectly,
would that keep the air from getting to the front?

I have no vents, but that's likely because someone fitted some type of cup
holder console in between the front seats at one time, and there is nothing
(no rubber, no vents, etc) at the side of the seat pedestals. I'll take a
closer look and report back.

And yes, the rod is exactly where you've described.

Leo... if your '69 is like my '71 ( and for this question, I think so) that
push/pull knob (down low, right side?) is for controlling a heat flap under
the bus to divert heated air towards the rear cargo/passenger area.  In a
walk-thru, ya can see the vents between the two front seats, facing the rear
of the bus, at the back of the walk thru.

The control flaps are under the bus, at a &quot;Y&quot; type junction....with a curvey
section of paper heater hose to divert the warmish air thru those vents,
when
ya pull/push the knob.

Hope this helps
