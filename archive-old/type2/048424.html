Subject: Re: [T2] Acessory Question on a 70

&gt; &gt;&gt;  Does anybody know if rubber clamp downs were acessories in the front of
&gt; the 68-73 poptops.  I have seen some with two rubber clamps in the front and
&gt; this may help when the top blows up in high wind.
&gt; 

Before resorting to drilling holes, is your poptop seal in good shape. 
I got one from Ron _at_ Busdepot (~$20 IIRC) and have had NO problems
since.  It's a nice tight seal between the poptop and window frame. 
Also check the condition of the wooden mounting blocks on the front
hinges.  One of mine was rotten (from rain leaking around the bolt),
allowing the bolt/poptop to lift up ~1/2 inch.

Good Luck
