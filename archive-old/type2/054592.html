Thanks a lot for that feedback.
It's real easy to roughly calibrate your VDO oil temp gauge.  Next time you 
drain the oil put the sender into some boiling water.  It has to be boiling 
with a heat source making it boil as you read the gauge and the sender can't 
be touching the sides of the container.  That will give you one point to 
judge accuracy from.  And that point is kind of close to the temps you are 
interested in.  It's not perfect but the price is right.
If you do decide to get a cylinder head temp gauge send it (gauge and 
transducer) to me and I'll check its accuracy.  All you have to do is pay 
postage both ways.
I used to grow crystals for a living and had to be able to control temp 
within a couple of tenths of a degree for days at a time.  I know how to 
measure temperature.
I tried using optical pyrometers.  That's what your friends &quot;thingy&quot; is.  
They measure changes in temperature very accurately but they don't measure 
the temperature of something very accurately.  They are too susceptible to 
variations in surface texture, color, reflectivity and contours.
I had a pressure relief valve oil temperature sender in my '71 many years ago 
and had a spare CHT sender that I put under one of the head nuts.  Both 
gauges were calibrated.  The readings on both gauges were identical.  They 
reached the same temperature at the same time going up and down.
I've since switched to a dip stick sender and other than it always reading 50 
degrees cooler that the temp actually is I'm pretty happy with it.  The 
corrected temps I get off my dipstick sender are typically 20 to 30 degrees 
higher that what I got on the pressure relief valve sender and the reaction 
time is much faster.  I wouldn't be surprised if you saw similar differences 
if you switched to a dip stick sender.  
I think the best way to monitor oil temp however is with a fine gauge 
thermocouple in the oil flow as it leaves the cooler.  But the same old 
dilemma keeps nagging me.  I never have time and money at the same time.
