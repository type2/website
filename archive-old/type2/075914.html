Subject: Van Fires.

Someone's post earlier today sounded like a very good idea.  ie- an electric
fuel shutoff valve, wired from the coil + terminal, on the fuel feed hose
under the gas tank. As long as you remembered to shut off the key, you could
hopefully starve the fire from that lovely gravity fed tank of gas.  Might
save a loaf or two. I am interested enough to do it. I want my van to last
for a long, long time. Anyone have any experience in this, or know of a
reasonably priced and reliable electric fuel shutoff valve?
