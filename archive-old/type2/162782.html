Subject: want a stainless steel bus?

Sorry folks, I'm just full of it today.

Also reading the saturday newspaper and see a cool article on how to paint 
your refrigerator so that it looks like stainless steel.

What caught my eye was that they touted the paint as.....

&quot;The brush-on &quot;paint&quot; is 100% stainless and automotive-grade.&quot;

Automotive grade!!!!!  &quot;brush on&quot;!!!

Of course there is a catch...the price.

ANd after reading the sarcastic comments here:
http://lifehacker_dot_com/software/decor/give-your-appliances-that-stainlesssteel-look-228304.php

I also noticed that someone about half-way down the page said this...

&quot;

Never mind the fridge--I wonder if two of these kits would be enough to 
paint my old VW bus?
&quot;

I still gotta wonder how good it looks...and what it might look like on a 
bus or bug....IF you wanted it to look like stainless steel.

LOL!   hmmm early Friday I guess.

Cheers, dave
