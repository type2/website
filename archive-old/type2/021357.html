Sorry to be the bearer of bad news Melissa, but the symptoms that you
have described are consistant with a failure of the large plastic gear
inside the motor/gearbox.  Some have claimed success with disassembly
and epoxying the gear back to the shaft.  (Didn't work for me.) The
easiest repair is replacement.  Try to get the entire wiper mechanism
assembly as it's a real PITA to get the arm indexed properly so that the
wipers park at the bottom of their stroke.

Jim
