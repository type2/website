Subject: Re: So I bought this hat...

&gt; ...Plastic things, rubber things, and such.

In my experience, only a VW-centric junk yard will have those parts.

&gt; ...got some answers from his mechanic for questions that have been on my
mind so I bought a VW hat from him...
&gt; ...Volkswagen is misspelled on the side!!! Volkswagon it says...

I guess you should take those &quot;answers&quot; with a grain of salt then. The dude
can't even *spell* &quot;Volkswagen!&quot;  ;-)

Drive safely,
Surfer Bob
