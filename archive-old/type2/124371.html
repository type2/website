Subject: Physics of towing

&gt; Let me simplify the problem by talking specifics. Which would use more
gasoline: a bus towing a bug? Or a bus and a bug traveling the same
distance, under the same conditions, but separately? And why?

It's been a long time since my physics classes, but intuitively I'd say the 
towing arrangement would benefit from inertia during cruising periods and it 
should thus be more economical to operate one engine rather than two.
