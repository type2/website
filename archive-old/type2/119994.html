&gt; Hi!  I just acquired a side step for under the sliding door.  I have a 78
&gt; westy.  Yesterday we tried it and it slid into the jack tubes just fine.
&gt; However,  I don't see any fasteners or holes for any or???     Anyone out
&gt; there have one?  If so how do they stay on the bus?

on my 79 I was given a side step from a fellow listee. It slides in
the jack points and there is a piece of flat stock on the bottom of
the tubes that enter the jackpoint. These pieces have a metal dowel
that should go into the hole on the under side of the jackpoint. HTH.
