Subject: battery draining the problem resolved i hope

after bringing my battery to a local firestone they
charged to charge it they told me to call in 2 hours
which i do and they told me it wasn't holding the
charge. So my mechanic said he would bring me a new
battery since this one was still under warranty. So i
hope this solves the issue. Is there anything i can do
to make sure this never happens again if my bus sits
for a few days so i now when i go back outside it will
start thanks to everybody with all the great imput you
will not be forgotten
