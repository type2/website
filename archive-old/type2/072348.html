Subject:  72 bus measurements

hi there,

we're trying to make ferry reservations for the alaska ferry system. 
our new, old (though not really old), bus is in anchorage.  we live 
in western ak.  reservations need to go in tomorrow to make the 
deadline for our trip, and so i can't take a tape measure out and get 
the info the ferry place needs.

we found a brochure online that looks about right for our bus (72 
hard top - adventure) or something like that that lists 8 ft high 
with that big high hard top.

if we come close we can just add an inch or two to reserve space. if 
you're longer that what you list on the reservation, you're bumped...

so, can anyone tell me, kinda soon, how long a standard 72 bus is, 
bumper to bumper, and how wide at widest point with standard mirrors 
folded to their skinniest?

THANK YOU!

this is pancake engine bus with round taillights.
