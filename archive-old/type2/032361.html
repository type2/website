Subject: RE: [T2] would you drive this?


I had a similar experience with the oil from the transaxle/engine junction. Is the oil the tell tale gear oil, does it sm=
ell bad? With mine the rear transaxle seal went out, the seal directly behind the throw out bearing on the clutch arm. I =
drove mine from Macon Georgia to Clearwater Florida, but I had to remove the plug from the side of the transaxle and pump=
 new gear oil in everytime I stopped for gas. The oil would only pour out when it was hot and the engine stopped. I guess=
 the &quot;splash&quot; lubrication style of the gearbox kept the level low enough only to spill when it came to a stop. Just thoug=
ht it might be of some help.
by the way if anyone knows the actual VW name of that seal, or maybe a part number, it would be greatly appreciated. Once=
 again, its the seal around what I believe is the main input shaft of the transaxle, directly behind the throw out bearin=
g looking at the clutch assembly with the motor pulled. Thanks!!
