I'm trying again to contact David F Martin ,Spartanburg area i think, if
anyone has an e-mail or any contact info please P mail me. He used to
subscribe to VB last fall. I need to touch base with him about his beetle
he left here last year after  he blew his bus engine Everybus. It has got to
go i need the room, and also storage for about 14 months,(which was supposed
to be a month or so). I haven't heard from him since about Sept of last
year.
Sorry for the lack of bus content,
Webpages will be updated last of this week. I'm running a bit behind.Later
