Subject: '66, kingpins

Hi all,

Last week I ordered rebuilt spindles from Wolfgang International and they
were waiting for me when I returned from my weekend trip to New Mexico.
These have the kingpins rebuilt, new grease fittings, etc. painted black,
new seals, look good.  The guy at Wolfgang said that *usually* the link pins
don't need replacing.  (I paid $199 for the *pair* of rebuilt spindles
and a refundable $100 core charge.)

The detailed instructions that come with the spindles say that if I am
*using my old link pin bushings* that I need to remove the old spindles
and take both the old and new sets of spindles to a machine shop and
have them press the bushings out of the old spindles and press them into
the new spindles.

On the other hand, they say, if I'm using new link pins and bushings, I can
tap the new bushings into the new spindles with a hammer.  (they give a
procedure for this involving having the link pin in the bushing while tapping
it in.)

So, I think, well, if my old link pins and bushings turn out to be in good
shape when I get them disassembled, can I possibly figure out a way to
remove the old bushings from the old spindles without having to go to
a machine shop.  I was thinking of using a setup with a large bolt, some
washers the proper size, and a socket large enough to receive the bushing
when it gets pushed out.  Anyone ever tried this?  It might be easier for
me to just pay the extra $50 and buy the link pin kit, I dunno.

I want to avoid the machine shop if possible because the place where I usually
take my work gets really snowed with work and might take a week to move the
bushings for me....

Thanks for any advice on this,

 -Dyer
