Subject: [T2] once upon a pre-owned tuna can

Has everyone thought of how much that Mitubashie is going to be worth in 2 
yrs? And how much the Bus is going to be worth in 2 yrs? The way the prices 
are going up on the cost of a VW Bus I would say invest in Buses instead of 
the stock market. I have traded as a hobby for 5 yrs and know a little bit 
about the market. The market and the economy are going to have a big shock 
coming very soon and well into the next decade. Believe me, the equity gain 
in Bus investing is going to have the best return compaired to the market. 
People are going to be shocked how much their mutual fund goes down and how 
much their Bus gain is going to go up. Buses ( most of all the splities ) 
are a wonderfull investment for the future. That is if you have some land to 
store them on in a dry climate. Cree,  Three Bays so far and looking for the 
next one or two or three..........
