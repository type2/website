Subject: Re: Cup Holders in Bus (was Re: Pertronics adjustment)

&gt;&gt;Neandereers don't think you should drink while driving. They put the cup
&gt;&gt;holders in there under pressure from marketing who were under pressure from
&gt;US Yuppies buyers in too big a hurry to pull over and park so they can eat

&gt;I have two cup holders in the front of my bus, and am considering adding
&gt;two more.  Reason being sometimes my SO and I order two drinks AND two ice
&gt;cream sundaes at the drive through.  You can never have enough cup holders.

Man I'm with you David!!  We need to line the whole dash with cup holders!!
Let's see, what all could we put in a spare cup or two?

1.   Change for the meters
2.   Snacks for the baby
3.   Pencils and Pens (teachers always have a pocket full)
4.   Tippy cup for the baby
5.   Small toys for the baby
6.   Tooth picks
7.   Rubber bands
8.   Tire gauge
9.   Extra packets of relish and mustard for those foot long chili cheese dogs!
10. Napkins (see above)

Hey David, you should bring your SO to the Turner Falls campout.
