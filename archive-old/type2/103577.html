Subject: Re: [T2] Mirror measurements request

&gt; Posted early yesterday about this, and the mold for creating the master for
&gt; the stem will be ready tomorrow.  I can take an educated guess at the
&gt; measurements (didn't find anything on-line), but should someone have them on
&gt; hand, I'll leave the diagram up at http://www.cfnson_dot_com/other/mirror01.jpg
Mike
A - 6 3/8&quot; as you have it drawn. The striaght part of the shaft is 6&quot; add
the other 3/8 to the tip of the bent portion

B - 4 5/8&quot; , as A. 4 1/4 to the end of the straight part of the shaft. add
the 3/8 to the tip etc...

C - 1 3/8 center to center.

D - 1 1/8 on the short side (top) like 3/32 longer on the lower side due
to the angle.

E sort of... The older mirror has an oval mounting head 2 1/8 wide by 1
1/8 high. the screws are centered vertically.

hope that helps.
