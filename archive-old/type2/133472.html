&gt;  &gt;&gt;But
&gt; why not just tie or bracket the license plate so that it sits very low

&gt; even tape or tie it to the outside of the cover?&lt;&lt;
&gt;
&gt; maybe i'm being pessimistic here, but isn't that absolutely begging
&gt; someone to steal your license plate?

and how, my wifes tags were stolen and they used em on a stolen car in a
crime...they were caught but now my wife has had to go to court 3 times so
far just to say that she didn't lend them the tags even though there is a
police report.  getting em stolen and replaced is the easy part.

In my case my bus has vanity tags and if they get stolen you've lost the
name you have to get something else it can't just be replaced.

so I have my front tag in my windshield and I have riveted the rear tag
on..   I know a lot of folks on this list have vanity tags so be aware of
that if their stolen, their gone...
