Has anyone had experience in replacing the U section centre chasis =
members that run between the front and rear chassis=20

My 71 bus needs the whole run on both sides replacing along with the =
sills wheel arches out riggers etc etc=20
how much bracing/supporting do I need to do before attacking it with the =
angle grinder
Or am I a pioneer in this field ?
admision.....
I couldnt wait=20
the front wheels are up on ramps and I have already cut out one complete =
side along with the outriggers and inner and outer sill
It didnt fall appart or appear to move=20
What do you think
How can I tell if it has moved ????

Jack the ripper.
