Subject: Re: Reliability of Busses (sic)

So you mean if you cut out the dying batteries ( they weren' original to the
bus, and i'm sure they weren't 20+ years old) and the water in the fuel ( either
of theses problems could have happend to ANY vehicle you were driving regardless
of age) both vehicles had a total of 2 vehicle specific failures......    seems
to me the bus itself is still just as reliable as the subaru.......

&gt; As most of us were taught in 8th grade English (but some have evidently
&gt; forgotten), the plural of &quot;bus&quot; is &quot;buses.&quot; It's one of those spelling
&gt; exceptions.
&gt;
&gt; Just for the record, in the 9 years I owned it, my 1986 Subaru GL wagon
&gt; stranded me for a ride to work 4 times. Two were a dying battery, one was
&gt; a broken clutch cable, one was a broken timing belt. And it overheated
&gt; and stalled me out once, and once had an expensive brake system component
&gt; fail slowly (did not strand me but did require repair).
&gt;
&gt; My 1978 Westfalia has stranded me 5 times in the 6 years I have owned
&gt; it. Once with a water in the gas tank problem, twice with dying
&gt; batteries, once with a dying double relay, once with a broken crankshaft
&gt; that also destroyed the torque converter (that was an ugly one).
&gt; So my 20 year old car with 200K+ miles has stranded me more than my 9 year
&gt; old one with 100K+ miles did. On the whole, the old bus has been less
&gt; reliable than the relatively new Subaru.
&gt; Your actual mileage may vary,
