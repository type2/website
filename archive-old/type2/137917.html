Subject: Re: [T2] More balancing

Shop manuals often instruct you to mark the position of the clutch on
the flywheel so you put them back together the same way, but do you
really think the engines are balanced at the factory? I don't have
direct knowledge, but I don't see the assembly line stopping for this.
I think the clutches and flywheels are individually balanced when
manufactured, but not balanced as a rotating mass.

&gt; If they are matched up as they were before then the engine will be in the greatest state of balance. That equates to longest life. How much less when you re-orient the pressure plate, I really don't know. If you don't know the original position (i.e. you didn't take photos) you might as well leave it as is.
 
&gt; Each part should have been balanced individually to some degree unless there was a greivous manufacturing mistake so IMHO the engine should be ok especially at the lower rpms.
