Subject: Re: [T2] why a stumble?

Volks,
Thanks for all the input.

A summary of  what has been suggested;
1) vacuum advance not working because total advance should be more like 42
degrees rather than 28
2) advance shouldn't jump around given a steady rpm (which it does)
3) check for worn bearings in distributor
4) check coil connections (I did and they are all clean and tight)
5) replace coil if stutter only happens when hot (which it doesn't, oddly, it
seems to be better when fully hot)

More symptoms;
Idle moves around about 80RPM (+- 40RPM) and stutter in motor correlates with
advance jumping around at idle (and at higher RPMs).

Questions;
Is my stock distributor serviceable (bearings, vacuum unit, etc)?
Is it better to replace with new? If so, what should I buy? Busdepot has
050s  for my year (78, FI, all stock). Is that the best choice? Is that a
stock replacement?

Again, thanks for the help. It is appreciated very, very much!

Regards
Chris
