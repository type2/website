Subject: Suggestions anyone?

Hi Folks,
I've been busy getting the bus ready to head to New Bus Resolution.  My bus 
is a '71 Deluxe that has a full width pull out bed.  I have just installed 
a Propex heater underneath the new jump seat.  I would like to be able to 
hook up to electricity and have all parts needed.  I do not want to cut a 
hole in the bus.  Can anyone suggest a good location for the electrical 
box? Thanks

Joy Thru Air,
