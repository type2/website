&gt; &lt;&lt; my first thought when i saw the engine was  that it as a compressed air
&gt; engine!!!!  In europe some small car work on compressed air!!  All you need is
&gt; a tank for the compressed air and piston!
&gt;  &gt;&gt;
&gt;  ...and a source of power (electric, wind, solar, bicycle pump...) to com-
&gt; press the air to fill the tank to run the motor. There's a huge volume of
&gt; air required to fill a motor repeatedly. The designs I've seen are mostly
&gt; for &quot;local&quot; use; limited range and top speed. Another problem with a com-
&gt; pressed air motor...No heat or AC, and no electricity for lights, etc. with-
&gt; out power robbing ancilliaries on the motor. I'm not saying it can't work,
&gt; just that the trade-offs are enormous...

the railroads years ago and some still today had special engines for
hazardous locations that they called &quot;fireless cookers&quot; or a lot of other
things, they looked like steam engines but rather than a boiler it was a
huge &quot;tank&quot; most often they used steam from a stationary source like a
powerplant that was remote from the hazardous location, sometimes they
used compressed air but that tended to be less efficient.

they could run around the plant for an hour or so before they had to
recharge and couldn't go very fast.  most often they had a battery for
lights.

now to relate it to VWs' I found one of these not too long ago when I was
exploring East Tennesse in my Bus.
