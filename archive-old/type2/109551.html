Subject: Re: [T2] What model years was the top-loading  fridge available
  in the  Westfalia?

The top loading fridge was available from 76-79. Im not sure where you would
put one in a Vanagon. The cabinet that would most likely be able to contain
all the heat coils and what not holds the water tank in the Vanagon
cabinets. This fridge was also not able to run on LP gas as where the
Dometic 3-way in the Vanagon ran on LP, AC and DC.
