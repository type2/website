Rob,
 The voltage regulator controls the field current applied
to the alternator. When there is no current applied to the
field, there is no voltage produced from the alternator.
Sooo, when voltage drops below 13.5 the regulator will
apply current to the field and the alternator will start
charging. When the voltage exceeds 14.5 the regulator will
stop supplying voltage to the field and the alternator will
stop charging. In other words I dont think it would be a
problem with your plan... 

As to RF shielding? Got me there.

Hi folks, a quick question: What is the difference between 
the voltage 
regulator used with the 55amp. alt. as opposed to the 70amp

alt? Will using 
the 55amp reg. with a 70amp alt. cause trouble, or is it 
just a matter of 
better RF shielding in the 70amp reg.?
