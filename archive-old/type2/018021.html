&gt; you can do all of these without pulling the tank, and with the engine in.

So what would I do first? (Besides grab a Haynes or Bentley...I'll keep my
eyes peeled for those.) I'm assuming you have to pull all the carburetion
off the pancake as a first step, remove the firewall and all becomes clear?

I'm planning on draining the tank first. If I've got rusty crap, I really
have to pull it out...um, don't I?
