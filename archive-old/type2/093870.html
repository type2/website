Subject: Re: [T2] vredenstien tyres

notes on the tire are

185/75R14 C
Transport Steel P75
102/100P
made in Holland
LT Load Range D
1875 lbs at 65 psi single
1765 lbs at 65 psi dual
Wasnt really happy about what i was finding available and decided there 
had to be more out there.  Tires Plus store manager up the street from 
me called their denver warehouse and found out about these tires.  He 
didnt remember who, but evidently they are OEM on some RV  sold  in the 
US.

&gt; Sounds like a 185R14C LRD tire then.  Wow, that's an impulse buy.  Glad 
&gt; they
&gt; worked out.
&gt;
&gt; What is the load range and max psi marked on the sidewall?
&gt;
&gt; Also, what chain carried them?
