Subject: RE: [T2] Custom Wheels

I was doing some research a while back on this didn't get to far , but some
Audi wheels will fit also the new passat wheels are the same 5X112 I don't
know what mods you will have to do to them but I thought they would be neat
as they are still VW rims. and the vanagon alloys will fit out of the box.
good luck and let us know what you find out.
later

Subject: [T2] Custom Wheels


Has anybody had any success recently in finding custom alloy wheels to
fit their bus? My bus is a '79 Riviera with a 5-112 bolt pattern and I
can't find any wheels other than the stock ones. I'm looking for a 15,
16, or 17 inch wheel with a mid offset.  I've tried the American Racing
Aero, but the dust cover on the axle hub protrudes too far. Who makes a
wheel that fits out of the box?
 
Thanks
