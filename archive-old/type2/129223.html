Subject: MB rims on a bay...

Hi Gang...

I have a nice set of these off a 450 vert that I'd like to mount new 
tires on for my Westie before I leave on holidays...I have the tires, so 
this is not a tire question...

I'm looking for someone who has done this on their bay and knows first 
hand what is involved...I know the stud holes require upsizing, but to 
what size....what nuts have you used, and is there any other clearancing 
I need to do for the hubs or anything else...

Thanks, Den
