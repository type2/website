&gt; Hi folks,
&gt; 
&gt; I came across a 1600 DP bus engine sporting a Lucas ignition coil.

Speculation:

Perhaps the Bosch coil works was working to capacity and they needed
more then they could make.  They could have contracted Lucas to
produce coils to Bosch (hence the Bosch part number) for the VW factory.

I don't know what I think of having the &quot;Prince of Darkness&quot;
responsible for firing my spark plugs, though...
