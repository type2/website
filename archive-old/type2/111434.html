Subject: my new bus

Greetings from Okla. City,
 I've just purchased a '75 bus. The body has no rust, inside or out. It has
a single carbeurator and std. transmission. It wouldn't start when I looked
at it and the PO said it had a bad alternator and that it had been sitting
about 9 months, but I could turn the engine (slowly) with a jump. Well, I
towed it off for $300. It's got alot of oil on the bottom of the engine and
there was oil in the grass under it. I filled it up with oil ( a quart)and
changed the starter and battery cable and it started right up. I checked the
compression (cold) and got 115 lbs. on 1&amp;2 and 120 lbs. on 3&amp;4. I drove it
around the block (slowy) and it shifted good. I then parked it and am
wondering what are some recommendations on things to check/adjust before i
really take it for a spin? Does it have hyd. lifters? Can I test the
alternator in the bus? Sorry for the long post. I'll try to stick to the
library and archives when possible. I heard there's a picnic this weekend
and some busses are coming in from Tulsa and I'd like to take mine if
possible. 

Thanks,

Dan, the new guy,
'75 bus
