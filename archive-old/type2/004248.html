This pedal stop just snaps into the mounting holes in the floor of the cab.
On any baywindow I've messed with the original rubber floor mat is cut to
accommodate this part.  It stops the accelerator pedal travel at an angle
that doesn't give you a cramp in your foot or ankle.

If your accelerator cable is adjusted to give full throttle with the pedal
[literally] on the floor in the absence of this stop,  you'd be wise to
check for correct clearance between the carburetor throttle arm and the stop
cast on the carburetor body.  There is a specific gap that's supposed to be
there at full throttle to avoid stretching the cable and placing a strain on
the carburetor.  Lack of a gap here is a common cause of broken throttle
cables and worn/damaged throttle shafts.

I strongly recommend installing the pedal stop and re-adjusting your
throttle cable, taking care to set the correct gap at the carburetor.  I
find a brick on the pedal holds it in the wide open position while I do the
adjustment in back.  If the prongs on the pedal stop are broken so it won't
stay put [a common problem] you can rig a metal strap that is screwed to the
floor to retain it.

FWIW.....

&gt;&gt;  i found out what this wacky plastic gizmo is (part # below):
in the 68-70 manual it notes this as an accelerator pedal stop. never
seen/heard such a thing! have you? do other folks have them - are they
useful? i don't see holes in the floor for them in my 75, but plain as day
two exist in the 68. loopy.      - steve  &lt;&lt;
