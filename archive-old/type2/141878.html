Subject: Re: [T2] Saturday parts delivery?

I absolutely love USPS! I you don't then you haven't lived in a certain country with inadequate service, no Sat delivery that likes to go on strike every now and again. Country, you know who you are!

As for UPS they have a long way to go before they make me happy:

Monday: order package from Importec via UPS.

Tuesday: I get call from admin on 1st floor telling me that I have a package. I walk down stars wondering what it could be because I'm at work and the package is supposed to shipped to home so what could this package be. To my surprise it's my Importec package!

As it turns out, my package accidentally got lumped in with a corporate delivery and by sheer luck I happen to work at the same company. The guys at the receiving dock, signed for all 50 packages at once, looked me up in the company directory and sent it internal mail to my building.

How's that for UPS efficiency? :-)
