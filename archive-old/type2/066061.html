Subject: HTML Help for my bus page

Hi all. I wouldn't ask if this weren't going on my bus page.
Anyway, I'm making a new page about my cross-country trek last summer, and
putting in all the reports I posted. My problem is that I can't indent the
first line of the paragraphs of all the text. I have put in &lt;br&gt;'s at the end
of the paragraphs, which starts a new line, but I can't figure out how to
indent the first word of the paragraph the proper 5 spaces. I have tried
hspace, but that won't work either. If any of you HTML guru's who can help me
out, I will be most appreciative. Anyway, as soon as I get all the bugs out,
I'll post the address. For those who can't wait. it's off my main page, the
address of which is at the bottom of my .sig below.
Thanks,
