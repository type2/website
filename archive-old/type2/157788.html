Subject: Re: [T2] 1974 VW 412 Type-4 for sale in FL

Yeah, it really kills me. I don't know why people do these kinds of things. I spent some time researching the car the past week. For the longest time I just thought it was a newer version of the &quot;squareback&quot;, only to find out that it's a completely different car, really quite rare actually... that they only made for 2 years. I don't know what would posess someone to feel the need to do this. I mean... wouldn't it have been easier to modify the intake tubes... or just get a set of dual carbs?

I hate to mess with it though (at least at this point), because it runs so damn well. I've never seen a Webber 2-bbl Progressive run this well... I mean, the idle doesn't fluctuate AT ALL... not even the slightest bit.

If the car doesn't sell, then I'll probably put $300 or so bucks into it and try to really make it a bit nicer... new turn signals, put on the dual carbs I have, etc. I really need another project like a hole in the head though...
