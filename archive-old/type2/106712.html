&lt;&lt; Oh yeah, it helps to have a good place to work on it with a fairly level 
hard 

floor so when you drop stuff it doesn;t play hide and go seek.  Also a secure 

place that you can leave the bus for a parts run if you find a surprize 

inside the brake drums.  It's not a good idea to drive it with metal to metal 

brakes because they don;t stop well and buses aren't known for their stopping 

ability anyhow.

 &gt;&gt;

A really good idea for first timers (and second and third, too) is a spot
where you can lift the entire rear of the bus and look at both set-ups.
It's easy to get confused (you will not 'remember' how it came apart,
once it's apart) and a quick glance at the other side is often better 
than any diagrams or photos from the manuals... ;-)
