Subject: Re: [T2] exhaust / high temp painting

Paul,

Mixed results with the por product applied 3 years ago on a stock bug 
muffler...but I didn't follow the instructions as well as I probably 
should have.

I have had(so far) excellent results from the hi temperature powder coat
paints that I have used.  Not too many miles on them(1500), but they still 
look like they day I painted them....even on the exhaust pipes next to the 
heads....and this is a after two 4 hour runs in 85+ weather on the 
interstate at 75+mph.

I have about come to the conclusion that my next test will be with jet hot 
coating as I have read that it also seriously reduces  the temperatures on 
the *outside* of the pipe and actually becomes part of the metal.


Cheers, dave

&gt; In looking through the archives, it seems that (a) no one has had a

&gt; Thanks for your patience everyone. I've got another un-related post
