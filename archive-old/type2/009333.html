 Well, i work as part of a Consultant firm in Paraguay. I used to be a Mercedes 
Benz mecanic but it-s not worth it to work for almost nothing (220$ per month) 
and sweat like a pig underneath a tin roof at 45-50 °C!! I do have also other 
jobs but i just work part-time as a mecanic, for myself and for my friends...
