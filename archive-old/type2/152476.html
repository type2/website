Nick,
The 1971 with push/pull vacuum dizzy is timed at 5ATDC. Not TDC. 5 degrees
advance could trigger some overheating.

Ask me how i know...

&gt;
&gt; About 200 miles later, I put a new Bocar 34-PICT-3 carb on it because I
&gt; just
&gt; didn't like the performance for some reason and since the carb was the
&gt; only
&gt; unknown quantity, it was replaced. Timing was about 0 at idle (it's the
&gt; stock
&gt; dizzy with vacc advance and retard except for the Pertronix stuff) and 31
&gt; at
&gt; max RPMs. Pretty standard though with my Pertronix, the &quot;dwell&quot; reads a
&gt; constant 63 degrees.
