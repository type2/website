&gt;  The quick rub is we're now in desperate need of a hole to hole up
&gt;in while she's there.  She's solo'ing this trip as I'm too caught up in
&gt;bizness to bail out with her.  Cheap accomadations are available as
&gt;I've made a few calls, but a unescorted lady (who doesn't drive) leaves
&gt;our downtown hotel options looking rather seady.
&gt;
&gt;  Any friendly volkfolks on the list who might consider a trade off for a
&gt;weeks lodging (just a place to toss a suitcase, meals not required).
&gt;Would be happy to offer same iff'n-when anyone would like to take a
&gt;vacation to sunny (yeah, right) Florida...

        Ok, we'll bite. Here's the catch: we've got a small 2 bedroom place
with 3 people in it, so it's full-on couch space that's available. A dog
and 3 cats if allergies are a problem. Also, for someone without a car the
bus ride downtown from here is kind of a bitch, we're on the outskirts of
Austin, so it's a solid 45 minute bus ride downtown. For contrast, it's a
10 minute drive... However, if the timing works out, I go to UT every
morning about 9am, &amp; would be happy to stop off downtown on the way in.
What I'm really saying here is: don't sweat it, you're covered. OTOH, if
you get a better offer, go for it, we won't be offended...   ;-)

Peace,
