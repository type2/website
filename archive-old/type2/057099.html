Hi Bryan,

The oil dran plug is easy to get at a VW shop.  YOu just get a new bottom
plate.  some also advise getting a magnetic plug...

As for your rear brake lights.  Do your turn signal lights work?  Do  your
parking lights work?

&gt; 
&gt; One problem that I have is breaking these studs of in the oil sump.  Does
&gt; anyone have a magic cure for this?  I know some sump plates have a center
&gt; drain plug, but mune does'nt.  I have to completely remove the plate to
&gt; change my oil.
&gt; 
&gt; Finally, I just bought this bus and the brake lights don't work.  I
&gt; checked the bulbs, and looked at the fuses (was'nt sure which one it is).
&gt; Does anyone have any recommendations?
