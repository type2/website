Subject: Dipstick Thermometer at Wamart

I just purchased one of these at Walmart and it was very helpful. I first
tested it against a proven thermometer using a pot of boiling water and in
fact it was pretty close at approx 210F.  I have a 68 Westy with a 1600DP with
a full flow filter system, an external cooler and an added sump to bring the
oil capacity to 6 quarts, ( just changed the oil). I then took it for a 1/2 hr
ride averaging about 50mph in sunny 60F weather. I have a  VDO gauge with an
electric sump sending unit never budged off of 120F. When I returned I pulled
the dip stick, marked the Walmart thermometer for the proper length, and
dropped it in the sump and sure enough the temp came up to 185F. The bottom
line is all the cost and labor to install the VDO gauge and sending unit was a
waste and the cost of the Walmart Dipstick Thermometer PRICELESS. I plan on
changing from the sump sending unit to the dipstick unit to get a better idea
of the correct temperature.
