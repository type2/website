Yes, the distr. rotor moves 1/4 of a revolution while the crank turns 180
deg- I use the crank as reference, it's more accurate, and make sure to
make a mark exactly 180 deg. from TDC (hope you have a TDC mark!)  One way
of determining TDC is to take out spark plug, then stand a dowel thru the
hole onto the piston and wiggle crank back and forth until you see its
highest point.  Start with rotor pointing to #1, then turn crank
counterclockwise 180 deg. to do #2, etc.  Great fun.  Usually I can wiggle
rockers and &quot;feel if clearance is enough!  MB
