Subject: High Oil Temps 1978 Westy

OK.  So I've spent the past three years trying to lower the oil temperatures
of the 2.0 liter engine in my Westy.  I have certainly made progress -- and
fixed many tangential problems along the way! -- but I have not succeeded in
substantially lowering the oil temperature.

Natural History:

Running temperatures in excess of 250* (sometimes 350*) as measured by a VDO
gauge with oil-galley located sensor.  Temperature confirmed via multimeter
w/temp sensor and by corresponding fall off of pressure with increasing
temperatures.  The temps will shoot sky high just sitting, idling in the
driveway or while going up slight highway grades.  Temps won't go down unless
I am driving a long, down hill stretch on a cool evening.  Ambient air
temperature seems to have only negligible affect -- i.e., if it goes up 20*,
the oil is maybe 5* hotter.

At present, oil pressure is good when oil is below 200* -- well within specs
actually.

I have

- had vintage Porsche mechanic set-up the CO and timing (in case I had
something terribly wrong; I didn't)
- replaced all FI seals and gaskets
- confirmed injectors working properly
- confirmed the exhaust is sealed
- replaced or repaired all engine-to-body gaskets
- confirmed at least some oil flow to cooler by spinning oil pump with drill
- replaced oil cooler with new unit
- replaced oil pump with new unit
- double-checked pressure relief valve and spring against two others pulled
from known-good engines
- cleaned all sorts of gunk from the cooling fins, fan, and air ducts
- replaced engine compartment door seals
- played with engine oil viscosities
- kept the windows closed
- maintained a 60MPH speed or less, despite engine's willingness to go 80MPH+

For my efforts, I now have:

- a smooth running engine  :-)
- a VERY LOW cylinder head temp that sometimes won't come off the peg...
- a quite engine
- improved gas mileage
- somewhat lower oil temps that now peak at 280* or so, so far this season.

I am at my wit's end.  The only thing left I can think of, by process of
elimination, it that the oil passages to the cooler are restricted somewhere.

Help!

Joe
