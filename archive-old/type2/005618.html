&gt;Zinc Chromate Paint/Coating will stop formation of new rust.

The Dupont VariPrime previously mentioned is a zinc chromate primer.
It will not prevent rust without some sort of sealer or topcoat. It's function
is to acid etch and adhere to bare metal, but it is porous and will not prevent
moisture from reaching the metal surface.
This product is highly recommended for restoration of body panels where
a complete paint program is being applied.

Zinc chromate paint ( enamel tractor paint ) designed for outside application
will seal better for a single material application. Suitable for frame or where
finish paint quality is not a concern. Same for Rustoleum  ( fish oil ) , etc.
Not recommended for layering with other quality automotive product.

POR-15 is the correct material for severe rust protection over inferior bare
metal preparation, and comes with it's own brand of metal prep ( degreaser )
and acid etch solution. It is for bare metal  with exposed rust. It may be
topcoated with POR paint or other quality automotive products.

Tar ( roofing compound ) prevents rust. cheap. good. gooey. black.
