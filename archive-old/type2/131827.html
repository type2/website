Subject: putting a dual carb 1700 into a 1977 bus

Hi, I have a beater 72 bus with a rebuilt 1700cc that has dual carbs.  I just
got a free 1977 bus that is cherry!  But the engine is shot and the tranny's
condition is unknown.  The '72 will be my donor for the tranny and engine.  I
will eventually put the proper, FI 2000cc engine into the '77, but will use it
as a daily driver until then with the 1700 engine.  It is my understanding
that I will need to remove the electric fuel pump from the '77 since the 1700
has a manual fuel pump.  Does that mean I have to change the fuel tanks too?
When I hook up the electrical to the engine, will there be any more than the
wires to the starter and coil?  Besides that, it should be straight
forward...right?  I will keep the other parts to convert it back in the
future.  Oh, did I mention the 77 has A/C, no rust, reupholstered seats,
cherry headliner and only one small dent?  I won't hook the A/C up of course
until the project is completed with the proper engine.  Thanks in advance!
John
