Subject: '71 with intermittant starting problems...
Message-ID: &lt;3700E648.64D5_at_worldnet.att_dot_net&gt;

We have a standard '71 that only starts when it feels like it.  Turn the
key, you get gas gauge, other dash activation, but no turn over, no
click even.  When it does start, it turns and immediately starts like a
champ (just installed a new starter).  I am guessing bad battery cables,
something wrong with the connection between the starter-ignition
key-battery wiring or something in the actual ignition-switch-key
itself, as this is a &quot;universal&quot; key installed in the steering column by
a previous owner.  

Anybody have any other guesses.  My sister claims that when her bug was
doing this same thing, her solution was really simple--but of course
she  can't remember what it was she had to fix...

Thanks.
