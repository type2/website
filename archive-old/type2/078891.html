Subject: Re: [T2] IRC

Hey Steve and all,
There's a pretty cool chat room program that's free and customizable
that you may be interested in using if you want to have a chat room on
type2.. 

check it out:
http://nakenchat.naken.cc/

yes, it is real, and no it's not porn :)

later,
Mike

&gt; Volks,
&gt; 
&gt; Just to re-propose this...  Since security concerns have shut down the IRC
&gt; server on type2_dot_com, and since some of us really miss it, and since Chris
&gt; (ncbus) Cybulski has come up with a new site....
&gt; 
&gt; The general gathering place is now:
&gt; 
&gt; irc.mit_dot_edu
&gt; channel #buslist
&gt; 
&gt; I am there now and we hope to keep the channel active every evening.  I
&gt; don't know to what extent I will be able to show, but it would be great if
&gt; there were a place to discuss all the non-bus stuff we all want to post,
&gt; but that is not really appropriate, not to mention bounce our ideas
&gt; around before we go working on our buses.
