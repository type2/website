Subject: Re: [T2] I Smell Gas...  (old story, new thread)

David,
Here is everything you need to know:

http://www.ratwell_dot_com/technical/FuelHoses.html

I have a 78 and I found every hose on the diagram towards the bottom of
Richard's page.  I used FI and clamps at every single junction.

Change every single hose or your bus will BURN!... really ;)

enjoy,
Mike
