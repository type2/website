Subject: 82 Westy Diesel FOR SALE

Hello,
	My name is Scott, and I have a 1982 Westfaila Diesel Van FOR SALE. The
van (Scooby) is in good shape, inside is clean and in excelent shape.
Exteriour is also in very good shape, although, there is a couple of
small dents in the side door, but nothing that someone couldn't take
care of themselves. (The only reason that I haven't taking care of it
myself, is that I haven't had the time lately.) The canves camper-top is
in fantastic shape, in fact last yaer I took the time to water treat it.
Scooby runs prety well, although in the future he is going to need some
head work. I'm hoping to sell Scooby for $5000.00 dollors. I am lokated
in the Atlanta aera.

Thank You,
	Scott
