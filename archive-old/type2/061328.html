Daniel:
Anyone who takes the engine out of an 80 Vandragon to fix the fuel tank
sender is probably going to be the butt of some pretty bad jokes. Last
time I looked under my 80 westy its fuel tank (or more properly the
rusty remains) was under the FRONT seats. I think they are all that way
(except Syncros).
Actually, I do like the idea of a removeable bulkhead fitting so that
one could do preventive maintenance, i.e., washing off the salty mud
that begins the demise of this finely crafted $600 piece of German tin.
Vanagons have been a real disappointment to me.
