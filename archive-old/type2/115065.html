Subject: Re: [T2] STUPID QUESTION... PLEASE HELP

on 5/15/03 07:58, you related:

&gt; 
&gt; QUESTION.... ARE THOSE BOLTS REQUIRED.  SHOULDN'T THE
&gt; TRANNY SWING FREE WITH THE ENGINE WITH NO MOUNTS IN
&gt; THE MIDDLE OF THE TRANS AND ENGINE (I.E. ABOVE THE
&gt; BELL HOUSING)?????????????????

the bolts are required.

those two bolts, and the mounting bar to which they are attached, are
designed to carry most of the weight of the engine and transmission. the
front mount (on the nose cone) is to stop the assembly from moving forward
and aft, and the rear hanger bar and flexible mounts prevent torsion, but
neither of these mounting points carry much weight.

 so, to remove the engine by the &quot;tilting&quot; method (which is my preferred
method, since it allows engine removal with all the tin intact), one should
always have to remove these two bolts, and they should always be
re-installed when the motor goes back in.
