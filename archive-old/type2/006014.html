Sorry to revive this old thread but,
winter's coming and I'm confused by the
archives.

What is the most popular anti-rust measure:
Oil Coating
Asphaltic (Patch or Roofing Coatings)
Rubberized Sprays

??

Winter water and salt is expected to return
to the northeast and I'm riding the fence on
which strategy to pursue.

I want to block out these nasties and preserve my
bus but I fear the hidden dangers of trapped water and
insideous rusting. Stuck in indecisiveness with winter 
coming.
Your latest summary thoughts are appreciated.

Thanks,
