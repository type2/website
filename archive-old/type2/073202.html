Subject: Free nose bra

Hello list-

I'm no longer subscribed (I have to be content with the archives) but I
have a like-new leather nose bra that is free to whomever wants it.  You
just need to pay the shipping (it weighs about 5-8 lbs.)  Bra fits '73-'79
(maybe '72, I forget when the blinkers moved.)

It came with my '73 and now that her nose is straight and beautiful she
doesn't need it.  I owe the good folks in this community one license light
lens, one spare tire, and a whole lotta advice so here is my chance to give
a little something back.  Please reply to above address.

Maaco, in Cambridge, MA did an amazing job with the body and paint, btw.
200 something for paint, 300 for fixing the nose (PO hit a deer) and she
looks brand newish.  I think the color is called sunshine yellow.
