Subject: Re: [T2] Wind powered Batt charging

&gt; &gt; What kind of rpm's do I need in order to generate a useable current?
&gt;
&gt; You will need about 4000RPM at the generator to make a reasonable amount
&gt; of current.  You're talking about a big windmill and a goodly amount of
&gt; gearing to make this work.
&gt;
&gt; For battery charging, you would probably be better off with a smaller
&gt; alternator that makes more like 5 amps of current.  If you camp places
&gt; where it is windy (Wyoming leaps to mind) it will keep things topped off.

My initial thought was that you will get enough to trickle charge at least
at idle 800-1000 rpm maybe. Now after I read your mail it occured to me I
forgot about the pulley ratio. so simply maybe 2:1 right. so I think it
should be able to charge the battery ay maybe 1800+ RPM. It wont have its
max output current but all you need is a couple amps to charge the batt.
