&gt; Hi all,
&gt; I recently replaced the exhaust elbow.  There is some sort of release valve
&gt; (for lack of a better description) that has a cap that screws on.  Well mine
&gt; blew off.  My question, what is it for, and does it need replaced
&gt; immediately?

It is a port for an exhaust gas analyzer probe. To insert the probe for
testing, you remove the cap. I believe it is m10 x 1.0, which is fine
thread, not standard. I very much doubt this exact part will be easy to
find, but you could make one with a nut of the correct size which is welded
or brazed closed. You might also be able to tap threads into the ID of the
stub on the elbow and use a short screw and copper ring to seal the hole,
but I would only do that as a last resort, try to replace the cap first.

If this part is missing you will probably have a poor running engine, some
backfires and possible lean running. Replace it.
