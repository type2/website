Subject: 81 misses when hot

So, when the thing is cold and the outside temp is cool, it runs great.  Plenty of power in all gears at all speeds.  As it warms up, it starts to miss sporadically.  You give it the gas and it just gives back a kind of a low gargling sound and low power.  If under heavy load, no power.  It's downshift and lots of gas to go at all.  Then, it'll just kind of kick in and run great. When it starts to miss, if I back off on the pedal and then ease on it again, it's like it catches it's breath and will kick in again...unless the motor is really warm / hot and then forget it.  It also doesn't want to go over 60 on the flat ever.  Sometimes the &quot;pedal trick&quot; results in bad missing and the van really jerks.  There's no consistent pattern to any of this except that when it's cold it runs fine.  My thoughts are sticky valve, bad injector/s, trouble in the fuel supply (the brand new pump makes far more noise than the engine).  The van idles fine, it sounds fine and drives great.  I'm tot!
ally perplexed...you gussed it, I'm an aircooled newby.  Any thoughts, speculation, advise would be appreciated.
