Subject: FS: Lot of Vanagon parts,2 engines in Southern Wisconsin

I am hoping to clean out my mini-storage in one big sweep.  If you have a
van and can pick everything up, you'll get a bargain:  I'm thinking around
$700 for everything.  Or talk me into something.  If nobody wants the whole
pile, I'll start pricing by the piece:


2.1 WBX from '90 Carat, 167k on odometer, engine unknown.  Said to be
running in need of rebuild.  I could not start it, and did not try very hard
(bought it to do a conversion).

All engine related components.  alternator, p/s pump, a/c compressor, engine
wiring, ECU, coolant distributor pipe, coolant distributor block, engine
mount beam, air filter box, AFM, injectors, idle stabilizer... whatever else
was on a complete 2.1

4-speed tranny, known good from 83 air-cooled Westy.  Shfted smooth in all
gears, no popping out.

Good pair of CV axles from '83 air-cooled with manual transmission.

2.0 air-cooled engine from '83 Westy, ran well, drove from FL to WI fine.
Some oil blow-by.  Includes alternator, good exhaust headers, good clutch
and flywheel, good starter.

Weber carburetor with manifolds, air filter for 2.0 air-cooled.  Works
great.

Four steel rims (black, not rusty) mounted with matching &quot;Euro&quot; tires in
almost new condition (estimate 5k miles on tires) from 83 Westy - will fit
any Vanagon or Late Bus.

3 good chrome VW hubcaps from steel rims.

folding side table and wall panel (gray, nice) from '90 Carat.

Jump seat brackets and seatbelts from '90 Carat (pair)

rear full-width folding bench from 90 Carat with 3 headrests (gray, good
shape)

chrome front bumper from 83 Westy, with both end caps and both front trim
strips, very nice condition.


Thanks!
Sean
