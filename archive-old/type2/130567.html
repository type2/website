&gt; I know fi is supposed to be more fuel 
&gt;efficient and better on emmissions, but it only seems to be that way when it 
&gt;is tuned perfectly and this seems to be pretty difficult to achieve w/o a

&gt;work on

Yeah, but you don't have to own the equipment and when it's in tune it stays in tune longer. Even Bentley suggests using a CO meter to be used to set the dual carbs properly.

I prefer to drive FI buses. Every carb bus has been a bus experience but lacking by comparison.

Tell that to all the 72 owners with no engine hatch. :-)

&gt;Is the conversion difficult?

No.

&gt;Will there be a lot of parts I would need to get?

Manifolds, throttle linkage etc.

&gt;Would there be a noticable difference in performance?

Yep. On a stock engine nothing beats FI (stock or aftermarket).

&gt;What carbs are compatable with my engine?  what are the 
&gt;benifits/drawbacks to duel carbs vs single carb.
