Subject: Re: Save the heat

&gt;I have an idea to save the heat in my '71 Westy. I propose making a cover
&gt;for the opening in the roof to the poptop. I would use snaps to hold the
&gt;cover on when not camping. Before I go to all the trouble, has anyone ever
&gt;tried this and do you think it would be worthwhile?

I was thinking of insulting the inside of the fiberglass roof. I 
think it might help with the summer heat as well.
