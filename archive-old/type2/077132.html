&gt;any tips on getting these things off or the correct sized hexnut tool would
&gt;be more than appreciatted.

May not be an Allen head. The original bolt is a &quot;cheese head&quot; or Triple Square
Look closely at the fastener. The proper tool will be less likely to strip the bolt.
And for your next question ( after the bolt head is stripped )  get the vise grips.
