&gt;i just found a '75 westy for sale...second owner, older retired couple. they
&gt;said they've camped in it for years....and that it is in excellent shape
&gt;except that it needs a new starter. of course i haven't seen it yet. they
&gt;are selling their house and buying an rv. could someone give me a run down
&gt;on what should be standard with it. and isn't this the first year of fuel
&gt;injection? what should i expect with that? they are asking $1600 for it.
&gt;also said it has new tires. i'll be checking it out tommorrow.
&gt;
&gt;thanks,

I had a friend with a 75 once and I was hard pressed to find anything different from my 76. The 
usual Westfalia package but without the stove (an option on Canadian models I think, maybe it 
was standard down there?).  The motor should be an FI'd 1800cc and the rest I imagine would 
be the same as your 74. Good luck selling the damn Ford, I can sympathize as I once had 2 Ford 
Tempos and they both sucked.  I must say that I envy you folks down south finding nice old 
vans owned by nice old people that only drove them on weekends and for a whopping $1500 
bucks and such.  All the vans up here (what few there are) are all beat up and rusted and people 
are always asking like 4 or 5000 bucks for them.  Jeez!, I thought things depreciated in value as 
they got older!  Good luck :)
