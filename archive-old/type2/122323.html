Subject: Re: [T2] Fuel line hose &amp; Breather Hose

&gt; I have my engine and gas tank out and tomorrow I hope to replace all the
&gt; fuel lines and all the short sections of breather hose. A vendor sent me 3m
&gt; of fuel hose that has the braided cloth stuff on the outside not the smooth
&gt; rubber fuel hose that I am used to. I am slightly wondering about the
&gt; braidedness of the fuel hose.
&gt; 
&gt; Is this right? Is this the best type of fuel line?

I don't think so although I have to say the original hose did last 25 years.
Bus Boys said it best I think:

&quot;Genuine Continental 7mm High Pressure Fuel Hose with smooth covering, no
outside braided cloth. Our opinion is that this a much better hose than the
original braided hoses you find on the some of the FI Buses&quot;

&quot;Note: We do carry the cloth braided variety for the fanatics&quot;

I'm not sure what genuine means because my bus came with braided hose. I
went with their advice and used the Continental hose: it's good looking
stuff.

&gt; Is 5/16 hose a close enough match to use on the breahter lines?  At least
&gt; the ones behind the firewall.  To be a geek  5/16&quot; = .3125&quot;  and 9mm =
&gt; .3543'.  Seems like it would strech the .0418&quot;.

That still 1mm...I found that hose at the local vwflaps.
