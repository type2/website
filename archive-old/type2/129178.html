Hi Gang...

I have only one, NIB...first $135 preferably to Paypal takes it...plus 
shipping to wherever you are at actual cost.

I recalled someone needing one recently so I started digging through my 
stuff and found all kinds of forgotten items...like two sets of 1.8  
rings by Kolbenring, and over sized type I main bearings(more than one 
set and style) to name a couple...items I'm sure I will never use...more 
to follow as I start my spring cleaning to get the town off my a$$...

I'm looking for a couple of upstairs bedroom blue plaid panels to help 
complete my 80 Vanagon project if anyone has spares...will trade or 
buy...not original, but will look spiffy...LOL

Please contact me off list...

Den.
