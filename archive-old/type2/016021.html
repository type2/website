Any light experts out there?  I can't get the right side back lights to
work.  When I put on the right turn signal, the right back middle (running
light) blinks (all other lights perform correctly).  When I press the brake
pedal, the right side back light all but goes out (Gets extremely dim) and
the left side gets very bright.  With the running lights on, both sides
work but the right side is a little dimmer than the left.  I had to repair
the flasher switch - it had fallen apart.  Before the turn signals and
emergency flashers were out all together.  I don't see any obvious
problems.  I took the gauge panel out to see better.  

Continuing search...
