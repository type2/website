Subject: My VANdalized Van, help if you can...

Twenty minutes ago they (thiefs) tried to steal my stereo. In the process
they screwed up the dash and broke my passenger side wing window. A neighbor
saw the guy when his friends came back to pick him up. He botched the job
and threw a fit. In the mean time he hit the half removed stereo and the
door several times with his fist. He left blood on the stereo and the door.
The buses karma kicked in and got the guy. YES... To bad the cops haven't
gotten him yet though.

Anyway, does anyone have a passenger side wing window for a 79? I'm not sure
what other years will work. The junk yards around here don't have any more
Buses. They all went to the cr&amp;$#er.

Any help would be appreciated.

TIA - Mark
