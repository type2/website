Folks--

Happiness for you. Our 1976 CA bus is for sale. We will have it at Bugout in
Manassas ,VA this Sunday for your viewing. We have not set a price: I figure
the right person will make the right offer, and take her home. 

I will post pictures of all impovements/interior/ etc. to our (AOL) website in
the coming days.

This was to be Suzanne's bus for the next 10 years, but over the weekend, some
things changed for us. We bought the Westy we always wanted, and must let her
van go to a loving home. 

In the past 11 months, we have spared no expense in making this bus
mechanically better than the day she was made. We have only put 19k on this
van, and some of these things were added VERY recently. If you are looking for
a rock-solid, clean, quiet, comfortable van to transport you reliably for
years, this is it.

Short list of improvements (we have receipts):

Rebuilt motor, including everything remotely needing refurbishment:
alternator, clutch, mounts, high-capacity Melling oil pump, new heater boxes,
All FI hoses/vacuum hoses, new exhaust/muffler; you name it.

EXCELLENT HEAT: exhaust is wrapped in RaceTec? fiberglass insulating tape
(more heat is released in exchangers), all heater ductwork insulated to R-4.3,
active recirculation ducting  (picks up warm air from inside van), three 300+
cfm blowers, all walls insulated with R-13 insulation and overwrapped with
3-mil moisture barrier. (During last years blizzard in Colorado we were in
shirt sleves in our van.)

Rebuilt suspension: Four new KYB Nitrogen GasAdjust shocks, all new ball
joints, tie-rod ends, steering damper, swing-arm pivot bearings, all 4 wheel
bearings pulled/cleaned/replaced or repacked, New CV boots, new Yoka Y-356
Load range D (8-ply) tires, etc.

Rebuilt brakes: new rear pistons, master cylinder, semi-metalic pads, shoes,
hardware, rotors and drums turned.

Soundproofed/undercoated body: including 65 square feet of Evercoat Q-pad
asphalt/rubber sound deadening tile, two rolls of 3-M Silencer strips, 4
gallons of Kool-Patch asphalt rubber sealant, 192 square feet of 1/2&quot; thick
non-woven foil-faced sound deadening padding, two cans of Polyueurethane
expansion foam sealant.

Re-upholstered interior: Luxurious cloth upholstery throughout, durable
matching loop carpeting, curtains for all windows, original (re-stuffed) front
seats, pristine original rear seat, very-comfortable fold out rear bed (sleeps
two), multiple luggage anchors discretely placed throughout. 

Extras: unique mounting system for 94-quart self-draining cooler (included),
propane tank, second battery (included), vastly improved interior lighting,
undervan/engine compartment lighting, 100,000cp spotlight, two flouresent
lights, LOUD dual air horns, halogen headlamps, and ORIGINAL windshield washer
that WORKS!

This van is fantastic. Paint is gleaming original, no rust (some little
surface scrapes, etc. no serious rust.) All that is left to do is a paint job,
new window seals, and this bus is new. Passes Strict NC (Wake County) Smog
test with flying colors. You have never been in a bus this quiet, warm, and
comfortable. Make a reasonable offer or cross post to where ever you think
helpful.
