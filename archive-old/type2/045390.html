Subject: Re: [T2] Oil leak at sending unit 71 type 1 engine

As has been discussed here in the past, the oil pressure sending units
frequently leak _through_ the sender.  The threads seal and ground OK in the
crankcase, but the oil leaks out between the non-metallic innards of the
unit and the unit's case.

This problem is becoming universal, it seems, and isn't confined to senders
from any particular country of manufacture.
