Subject: Re: [T2] HELP ME !!!

  I suspect you are going to have difficulties with the mechanic after 
3000 miles on what sounds  like a no warentee job.  What kind of epoxy 
was used.  there is one product that  has been getting pretty high 
reviews from our customer and i have  now  used it twice myself.  once 
was to glue a  hole shut on my egr box.  a definate high temp spot.  
the product is  J B Weld.  the catch  is  where is  this hole and how  
big is it?  did the old patch just fall out?  has the hole become a 
crack? or is the oil simply bypassing the patch?
