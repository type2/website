Subject: RPM Limiter

 Volks,
    I have a '79 2.0L FI with Calif emissions. I just installed a tachometer
and I was wondering in this tach is working properly. It seems to be maxing
out about 3200 RPM. I looked in bently's book and found nothing. I would
appreciate info about the RPM if there is one and if I modifiy it or what? I
need some info.

Thanks
Brad
