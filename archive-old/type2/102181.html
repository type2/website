&gt;Another weird one:  002 300 043D is shown fitting all
&gt;from the beginning of 68 thru vin 212 2088 996 (Dec
&gt;71).
&gt;
&gt;But the replacement case is different: 

I can confirm that there is something different about the '68 transaxle.  I once bought one from a wrecker, but when I tried to install it there was a major difference that prevented me from using it.  I had to return it to the yard (fortunately, they took it back).  It's been a long time but I think it was something to do with the nosecone/shifter area.
