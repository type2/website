Subject: Fuel Rail Replacement

Hi Folks,

I was curious if anybody knows of a good source for FI fuel rail.  The rail 
on the 3/4 side of my engine appears to have been rubbing against the tin 
where it goes thru the hole in the front.  There is a small cut in the 
pipel, and while it is not cut all the way through, it is definitely 
compromised from the way it was when it was installed.  I clearanced the tin 
and wrapped the pipe with tape, but I would really like to replace the whole 
thing before it wears away and sets my Bus on fire.

I couldn't find the part after a cursory search of Bus Depot and Bus Boys, 
but that doesn't mean they don't have them.  Again, the part I'm looking for 
is the metal line that goes from the tin past the 3/4 injectors, with 
attacment points for the injector fuel lines.

Thanks in advance for any help or suggestions.
