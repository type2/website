Subject: RE: [T2] Is this to hard for a beginner?

Johan,
	Congratulations. Good decision. Now you need to gather some resources. Get
a copy of &quot;how to keep your volkswagen alive&quot; by John Muir. Famous guru and
spoken well of on the list. Read it. Then a genuine manual for your model.
(library) Get a friend to help, set aside a weekend and you should be
driving by Sunday lunch.
	 As to the wiring, this is a pig of a job imho - wait and see what works.
Good luck.
	Barry Wright

&gt;
&gt; I have just become a lucky owner of my first car, a volkswagen
&gt; transporter
&gt; 73.
&gt; The car is in very good condition, well etleast the body of the car.
&gt; I have searched the car all over and I can´t find any signs of
&gt; rust and all
&gt; of the doors works good.
&gt; Now over to the not so good things about my bus:
&gt;
&gt; First of all is the cables, they are old(very old) and the are
&gt; just a mess.
&gt; And some of them are not working as well, so I guess I have to
&gt; replace all
&gt; the cables to new ones and maybe some other electrical stuff. The
&gt; old owner
&gt; has started the job but got stuck so he just left it in a complete mess.
&gt; And now I wonder how hard it is to replace all the cables for a beginner,
&gt; how much it costs and if you need a lot of speciall tools for the job?
&gt;
&gt; The second thing is the engine, the problem there is that it´s out of the
&gt; car and I have to get the engine home to my place and then
&gt; install it in the
&gt; car. Now remember that I am a beginner in vw-busses and I have no ideá of
&gt; how I should do to get the engine back into the car.
&gt; There must be some homepages on the internett on this issue but a haven´t
&gt; fund any.
&gt;
&gt; So what do you think? Am I just a complete fool that takes a car
&gt; home that
&gt; doesn´t even work or are these problems easy to fix even for a beginner?
&gt; Maybe I also should tell that I bought the bus from a old friend
&gt; so I know
&gt; that the engine works and that the buss is ok (or atleast was?)
&gt;
&gt; So now I am in a situation where I need all(and I mean all) the
&gt; information
&gt; I can get.
&gt; I hope you all understand my questions and I am sorry for my poor englich.
&gt;
&gt; Thanks!!
&gt;
