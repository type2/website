Subject: RE: Need Help...

Playpen is dead, I was driving home and she just started stuttering and died.
Shes turning over but not firing. Any suggestions or advice in which direction
to take to fix her  would be greatly apperciated. Shes been sitting a couple
of weeks now and I could not get on the computer as we were having problems
with the computer as well.

Thank you to all in advance,
