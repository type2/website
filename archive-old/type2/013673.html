I've had Pertronix and Computron and they both failed and I re-installed
my stock points.
I'm just not going to be crippled by cheap *super ignition* that isn't
super at all.
Getting another replacement of a poor product isn't a fix when you're on
the side of the road installing your stock point set to get home. If they
paid tow charges as part of their warranty they would be owned by AAA.

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;Pertronix units are great when they're working.  But they create a
&gt; whole new
&gt; category of headaches when they're not.&lt;&lt;&lt;
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; I just dont get this thinking and Ive seen it a number of times.
&gt; Carry a spare dizzy complete or a set of points/cond and 
&gt; troubleshoot by
&gt; swapping the same as you would if there was a faulty set of points 
&gt; or
&gt; condenser in there.
&gt; In reality its easier because it is either working or not. There is 
&gt; no
&gt; adjustment problem to fiddle over.
&gt; Personally my preferance would be to carry a spare dizzy with 
&gt; another
&gt; pertronix in it. 
&gt; The unit is warranteed for 18 months. If it fails within this period 
&gt; you
&gt; get it replaced. I just see it as a high failure part. Surely It 
&gt; doesnt
&gt; have a high a mtbf  rate as points.
&gt; 
&gt; As far as economics go. I calculated that a daily driven 
&gt; (15000mi+/yr)
&gt; bus will require approx the same outlay for points/cond as the cost 
&gt; of a
&gt; points repl unit over 18 months. Of course thepertonix has gone up a 
&gt; bit
&gt; since I last checked.
