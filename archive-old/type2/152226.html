&gt; I brought it home on an 009 because it wouldn't start with the
&gt; original distributor. Had light pinging with the 009, so I installed
&gt; an early Mallory. That's the one I've been working with the most. The
&gt; 16 to 40 thing didn't work out. It was better at 14 to 38, but still
&gt; not good enough to put back in service. I have another dizzy from a
&gt; Porsche 914 I will try next.


you need to put the original vacuum dist in it for it to advance properly
