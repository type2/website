Subject: Re: [T2] Intro and Heat...Oil Temp Gauge

&gt; In regards to the Heater string, I apologize for the delay in returning the
&gt; mess. I was out of town in my Westy.

The temp was quite cold last weekend here in Vancouver, (4deg Celcius) and I was
able to test my new combination original heater box configuration (recently
rebuilt) and the PO's install of a Propex Compact 1600 Propane heater.  The
results were great!
I also hung a wool blanket behind the front seats with pony clips while I was
driving and the front got toasty warm.

This propex heater is wonderful.  It's mounted under the rear fold-down seat in
it's own plywood box.  The heater is exhausted to the outside via a 1&quot; dia
alluminum flex pipe thru the flooring underneath it. (yes there's a new hole in
the bus, but worth it.) The hot air tube is a 2 1/2&quot; flex pipe coming out of the
heater on the pass (right) side and integrated to the heater vent outlet on that
side.  It's all done very professionally.  The thermostat is mounted on the
closet wall inside and has a 3 position switch. Heat-Off-Fan  and a small dial
for temp control.

The stock heater isn't completely functional but adequate for now.  The rear
control cable isn't installed so the hot air coes immediately to the front of
the bus where it's needed most.  I alternate between defrost and foot warmth as
I drive.  All the other recommendations that the listees mentioned about warm
clothes is helpfull also.

Another thing I noticed that no one has mentioned that I feel is important is
that since the engine is air-cooled, it's important to have the engine
compartment sealed off from the underside of the bus for maximum cooling.  The
foam seal around the shroud is of utmost importance for coolong as well as
HEATING.  With a well-sealed engine compartment, the forced air from the air
intakes on either side of the bus creates a higher air pressure in the engine
compartment.  Therefore, the little fan that has to work so hard to get hot air
up to the front of the bus has quite a bit of help from the higher air pressure
in the compartment.  Thus the air blows quite a bit stronger when moving
foreward.

There's my 2 cents worth.
