I received the Master Cylinder from RMMW on Thursday and started the
replacement on Saturday.  All went amazingly well.

Opened the top bleeder on the drivers side and drained the upper and lower
reservoirs (I do not have a syringe).  Both brake lines to front and rear
came off without breaking (way lucky on that one!).  The front most switch
was removed easily but was trashed and full of gunk.  I mean IT was nasty!
Crud up to the end of the terminals.  The rubber boot that is supposed to
protect it is history.  The other switch and its boot are OK and came off
easily also.  The junction from the down tube to the lower reservoir was
easy since I re-worked that in the spring.  All the parts were so well
preserved by undercoating that taking the MC off was a breeze.  The only
major PITA was getting the lower reservoir detached from the old MC.  Used a
vice and brute force.

Putting it back together I had to replace the front brake switch harness.  I
found a headlight replacement plug at my FLAPS that has the same terminal
pattern as the original part and it fit perfectly on the switch.  Soldered
the wires and wrapped the whole thing in lots-o-tape and heat shrink tubing.
Getting the brake lines started in the MC was a little stressful but
eventually they went in.  The junction for the down tube to the lower
reservoir was sealed with a piece of inner tube.  The original seal failed
this spring an I was forced to improvise.  The bleeding of the lines was the
real test of the lack of pressure in the rear system.  They flowed rather
nicely during the process and I am happy to announce that the brakes are
working great!

Whew thats over with and now on to the leaking tranny into the CV........

Peace....
