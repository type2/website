Subject: [T2] Vinyl Repair

Greetings Esteemed Listerinos,

I've just spent a while searching back through the Library and the Archives 
for some information on vinyl and plastic repair.  Specifically, I'm 
referring to plastic/vinyl interior parts.  In my particular case I'm 
wondering how to repair the two cracks behind my dash grab handle (Geez, they 
seem to be there on every Bus I've ever looked at).  The other sore spots are 
my door panel fresh air ducts which are cracked in a number of places.  So, 
what do we use to make plastic repairs?
The dash I have to repair (the rest of it is almost pristine).  I guess I 
could replace the ducts..........I've just never (NEVER) seen them for sale 
anywhere so I'm supposing they are kinda hard to come by.  Of course, any 
help is appreciated.

TYIA
