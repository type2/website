Subject: Carb question

I just got the new 31 PICT for the bus, and everything is going well,
the only question I have is there is another port on the side of this
carb that is not on the current 34 PICT carb, it is inbetween the float
bowl and the throttle arm, can someone tell me the point of this port?

Thanks,
Jonathan
