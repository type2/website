Hello, Chuck -

My thoughts on A/C in a bus.

1. It will increase your frontal and side area, so wind resistance
will increase and it will be more squirrelly in crosswinds.

2. Will make your rig somewhat top-heavy leading to more sway in
corners.

3. Most A/C requires engine power to be effective. A &quot;battery
powered&quot; A/C, IMHO, cannot possibly be powerful enough to do any
good in a large area like the inside of a VW bus.

4. Your top clearance will probably exceed 8 feet, so going
through car washes will be difficult. (Also getting into garages)

5. Cutting holes into your steel roof will weaken the whole body
structure, allowing more flex of the entire structure. This also
*will* cause problems with roof leaks after enough time has passed
for the caulking to stiffen. Almost guaranteed to cause water
entry.

6. A/C on the roof of a VW van would (IMO) look ugly and break up
the lines of the body style. It even looks bad on an RV!

7. The compartment size inside the VW bus is so large the A/C air
cooling will be diluted by all the hot air in the vehicle. It will
probably only be effective if you are sitting directly in the air
stream coming out of it.

8. Air will be hot when you first enter the vehicle on a hot day.
It could take *hours* for that puny battery powered unit to cool
enough to notice.

I had an aftermarket A/C unit on my bus, powered by the engine,
and well integrated with the vehicle. It was an expensive
installation done by a good certified A/C tech.  But I took it out
and used the under-chassis A/C radiator for an oil cooler.  It
even had two fans to help at low speeds.
