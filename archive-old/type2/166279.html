Subject: camping this past weekend with the Calivw78 family

The kids and I met Troy and family up in Estes Park for a weekend of 
camping.  Unfortunately late planning meant we didn't have spots next to 
each other.  I didn't end up with any pics of their setup.  This was 
camping trip #2 for Green Pea.  Here's some pics.
