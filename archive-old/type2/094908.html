Subject: Re: [T2] petrol line paranoia?


I figure I'd go ahead and use another name for the petrochem. in the subject 
line :^)

About two years ago, maybe three, I went ahead and bought a roll of Good 
Year fuel line and used it on all of the fuel lines on my bus AND 
beetle(which I no longer own).  These lines still look and feel as good as 
the day I installed them.  They were a MUCH higher quality than what is 
available at the local FLAPS.  Ask your speedshop retailer to get you some, 
and try it out!

	Eron
