Subject: Re: [T2] Zamboni parts

The muffler I have on my 65 Kombi is a muffler that was kept as a spare for
a zamboni.................

It was a genuine VW muffler...   the only differences between it and a bus
muffler are......   the zamboni muffler didn't have the small heater
chambers on the upper pipes going into the muffler, and the small bracket
that is welded to the body of the muffler for supporting the tailpipe is on
the oposite side ( on the zamboni application the tail pipe shoots over to
the right side, where on a bus the tail pipe shoots off to the left.....)

&gt; Does anyone have good ideas on finding parts for air cooled Zambonis? For
the
&gt; most part the part numbers are the same (points, rotor, etc) however I am
&gt; having a difficult time finding a muffler.
&gt;
&gt; At first glance it looks like the traditional TypeI stock muffler with a
&gt; single exhaust pipe however the part number listed in the Zam manual is
&gt; 126251053E, which I cannot find anywhere.
&gt;
&gt; The rear plate that covers the muffler is wide like an older Porsche
plate.
&gt; There are simple pipes running from the heads to the muffler (ie. no
heater
&gt; boxes).
&gt;
&gt; Any ideas would be appreciated.
