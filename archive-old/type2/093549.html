I need more info than that so I bought a small LCD display with built-in voltmeter circuitry.  There is some light wiring involved but the nice thing is that it will display 0-20V in 0.01v increments.  Most digital voltmeters (not multimeters but plain voltmeters) only display in 0.1v increments.  You need the extra granularity because the full-empty range of a battery is only 0.7v (well, I need it anyway).  I haven't hooked up this display yet but I have high expectations for it.  I got it from http://www.bgmicro_dot_com - a great place to shop IMO.
