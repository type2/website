I believe Steve Dolan is going to add it to the type2_dot_com library, but when
I called it up from there the URL didn't kick in.  Either way, if you want a
copy from me, just send an address and it's yours.

&gt;John, I'd like to get a copy, but wouldn't it be cheaper/more efficient for
&gt;you to email out a scanned version?
&gt;
&gt;Thanks,

&gt;&gt; I drew up the design I used for my engine dolly last year, then offered
it
&gt;&gt; on the list to anyone interested.  I have a 1600 DP, but the plans could
be
&gt;&gt; easily modified for most any of the aircooled engines.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Looks like I'm accumulating another list of mail-ees.  If anyone is
&gt;&gt; interested, I'll mail them a paper copy of the plan (it's on a single
piece
&gt;&gt; of 11 x 17 paper, done on cadd and easily read).  Also makes a good stool
&gt;&gt; once the engine is back in.
