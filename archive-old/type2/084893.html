Subject: RE: [T2] Gathering group to help engine drop  (Troy's bus)

Indian Head gasket goop. It is a thin dark colored &quot;glue&quot; that an old 
mechanic I knew swore by. You can still get it - different brands and names.

It acts like a sealant and a light glue and I have taken to applying it to 
everything including the seating surface of crank and shaft seals.

Can't hurt and I think (THINK) it keeps my motors a little bit drier. You 
can also apply it to studs and such...


&gt;Chris,
&gt;         I have the seals already (From Busted Bus, thanks Joe!).  Here
&gt;is the list of parts that I already have.  I am going to do the both the
&gt;seals for the engine and tranny while  at the same time.  Any
&gt;suggestions to other items that I should have are welcome.  Thanks
&gt;
&gt;Flywheel Washer
&gt;Clutch Disk
&gt;Rear Main Seal-Tranny
&gt;Flywheel O-Ring Seal
&gt;Rear Main Seal

&gt;
&gt;
&gt;The engine and tranny have to be separated but the engine does not have
&gt;to
&gt;come apart if it is the rear main seal (which it sounds like).
&gt;
&gt;It will simply require engine removal, flywheel and clutch removal.
&gt;
&gt;New seal - grease it where the seal touches the crankshaft.
&gt;
&gt;Back together.
&gt;
&gt;You can get this seal from any FLAPS.

&gt; &gt;I was told by someone that it has to be split to replace either the
&gt; &gt;main or rear main seal.  Can't remember which one.  I personally do not
&gt;
&gt; &gt;know what needs to be done.  (I have been reading the engine drop
&gt; &gt;procedure in Bentley and stuff in the archives and have not run by this
&gt;
&gt; &gt;either.) If that person is wrong, that would be fine by me.  :)

&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Hey Troy - what seal requires the case to be split?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;A can't think of a single seal that requires case splitting.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;By the way the case is the engine block.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Hope you and your wife are doing well.

&gt; &gt; &gt;Ill hold off on the trade for now...:)  One problem is the wife is
&gt; &gt; &gt;pregnant at near 30 weeks and with possible pre-eclampsia.  So I am
&gt; &gt; &gt;not
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;sure that I would be able to get too much out of her right now.  And
&gt; &gt; &gt;would not expect much.  I guess the reason that I am so worried is
&gt; &gt; &gt;that
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;one, I don't know how the whole engine works.  I know the concept,
&gt; &gt; &gt;and what a lot the thing do, but the whole picture is far from there.
&gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;Cracking that case to replace the seal is also something that I have
&gt; &gt; &gt;really no idea about.  What part is the case?  (Its that bad.)  I
&gt; &gt; &gt;have new fuel lines and injector seals in route to me right now from
&gt; &gt; &gt;Busted Bus, so that should help out a lot.  They need to be replaced.
&gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;The other thing is that looking through the Bentley, I don't quite
&gt; &gt; &gt;have all
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;the parts, nor the money to purchase them.  Sucks being the only one
&gt; &gt; &gt;bringing in the income.  Like I said though, if I have to I will try
&gt; &gt; &gt;and do it myself.  (Would just be much more comfortable with extra
&gt; &gt; &gt;experience hanging around.)  Thanks...I'll let ya know how it goes.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; or at someone elses.  The situation that I am in leaves me to try
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and do this on a weekend because it is my only mode of
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; transportation. However, the bus will not make it much longer the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; way that it is and this needs to be done soon.  I am determined to
&gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; get this done and if worse comes to worse, I will drop it at my
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; house by myself.  (Knowing
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;Have a little faith in yourself.  Turns out that a wife makes a great
&gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;helper.  Dropping the engine is the easy part, just follow the
&gt; &gt; &gt;Bentley intructions.  Make sure you have whatever tools (and parts)
&gt; &gt; &gt;that are required to do your repair before you get started though.
&gt; &gt; &gt;For me, it seemed that installation was a little more time consuming,
&gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;but I was being careful to the point of my wife calling me anal.  If
&gt; &gt; &gt;it's been awhile since your engine has been removed, it's a great
&gt; &gt; &gt;time to clean/replace the engine bearer bracket bolts.  Oh, check
&gt; &gt; &gt;that fuel line too.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;I'd suggest pulling the engine Friday evening, that way you have time
&gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;to scrounge parts on Saturday if you come up short or break something
&gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;during the removal/repair.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;I'd love to help but it looks like I'll be replacing the timing belt
&gt; &gt; &gt;on
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;my wife's Rav4 this weekend.  Trade ya...
