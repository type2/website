Subject: brakes, what did I miss??? - DONE!

After dicking with them all weekend, I got all the air out of the lines and
finally got the brakes adjusted properly.

I kept finding that I was rushing the adjustment on the star-wheels thinking
that I could &quot;max-out&quot; each one independently and then back off from
there... BOY was I wrong. Let's just call it a glorious absence of rational.

I ended up moving each star-wheel the same number all the way until it
started to get tight, then I would go stomp on the brakes, find that they
were loose again, and get down to tighten them again... I think this is more
or less what George was telling me was similar to his method.

Either way, I got both of the brakes adjusted very nicely. After I was done,
I adjusted the parking brake from 6 clicks as Bentley suggests, and now it
holds better than it has in YEARS!

Thanks to everyone for their input. You all are PRICELESS!!!!

The greatest single cause of atheism in the world today is Christians, who
acknowledge Jesus with their lips and walk out the door, and deny Him by
their lifestyle. That is what an unbelieving world simply finds
unbelievable.
