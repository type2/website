This might sound like an overly worrisome approach...BUT, recommend you 
measure the tap tool and inset itself as soon as you open the timesert 
package. (last fall in NC, had a Timesert set screw up my repair on a KG 
1600..and THEN found out the tap was one cm too large for the correct insert 
though it was in an enclosed blister-pack!! I've not been able to find an 
off-sized replacement yet either:(. The company offered my money 
back..thanks a lot..

Anyway..maybe one in ten thousand chance..but you might want to take a 
minute to check it..

Regards, Marv Krupp..always sadder..seldom wiser..
