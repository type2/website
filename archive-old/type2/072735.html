&gt;I would be interested in reading about adding an o 2 sensor to your exhaust
&gt;manifold.  I have a 77 2.0 in a California 79 Loaf.............
&gt;..............................  On the initial smog check,
&gt;the Loaf failed because of high CO readings at idle.  I quickly ran over to
&gt;Portland, Oregon and had it adjusted.  It went through with flying colors,
&gt;BUT the  engine runs like crap.

They probably adjusted the by pass on the AFM but not readjusted the idle
screw.  It takes a trial and error approach of both to get it right (and
some way to read richness).


 &gt;I decided I would install a 02 sensor in the exhaust system in the
&gt;Y section of the exhaust pipe. Now learning that I have a Fed system (????),
&gt;and it does not use a 02 sensor I guess, I would still like to use it for
&gt;idling purposes.

  You can't install a lambda circuit with out a lambda ECU but you can use
a O2 sensor to gauge richness and set tune up.  My 77's stock exhaust is
long gone so I had to weld a socket in the elbow coming out of the exhaust
port to do this.  Bentley (fig. 5-3, pg 25) shows an elbow next to the
cross over pipe that has a anylyzer probe port.  Do you have this.  What is
its size and what threads does it have.  I'm wondering if you could screw
in a Bosch O 2 sensor here.  They use a 18 mm spark plug thread.

 &gt; When this engine is hot, it doesn't idle very well.  Does
&gt;stall allot.  Currently the CO adjustment in the Air Sensor has been
&gt;readjusted by ear and the engine is running like it did.  So you have all
&gt;the background and I am interested in what you have to say&gt;

Could be a lot of things.  Have you done the standard EFI ohm test (tell me
if you need the readings chart)

Is your temp sensor #2 new.  Are it's threads corroded?  The above test
should tell you if you have any problems in the AFM or sensors.

The O 2 sensor should be installed as close to the exhaust ports as
possible as the one wire variety do not have heaters and rely on the
exhaust heat to get to 600 degrees (300 min. degrees) operating range.

Hook up a good (Millivolt) volt meter,  Bring the engine to operating temp.
The meter should range between 0 and 950 mv.  You will note that it
bounces around alot.  Take the approximate average for your reading.
Stoich or perfect air fuel ratio of 14.7:1 for emmissions is 450 mv.  My
experience is that the 1% CO exhaust gas meter reading at the smog shop
will actually give your O2 sensor a  richer reading of approx. 550-600 mv.
Any higher is to rich.  Any lower is to lean and will cause engine damage.
( I'm looking for others experience to varify this).

Parts needed can be purchased from Autozone for about $20.:
   Help! Spark Plug Non Fouler 18 mm socket # 42002
   Bosch  O 2 sensor 0-258-001-028

Note: red lead on multi meter to O 2 sensor and black to a good engine
ground. Don't ohm test the O 2 sensor or you'll ruin it.

Let me know what you find out.  I'm compiling a list of Common FI problems
, symptoms and remedies so I would appreciate you letting me know what
transpires.
