Subject: Fuel line from Lowe's(was Gas leak)

I know this is only somewhat related, but I just had to throw it in. I was
at my local Lowe's Hardware store and was looking around for a knob for my
SO-69 Stove, and saw that they have fuel line in bulk. I looked closer at it
and it is real good stuff, it is rated at 200PSI, and is FUEL rated. It is
less than a buck a foot and had a nice shiny look to it(black). The only
down side is that it is only available in 1/4in, 5/16, and 3/8in, no MM
sizes. I do not know if 1/4in is close enough to 5mm to work correctly or
not, but the price was right. This does seem like it would work great for FI
and Non FI systems.

Subject: [T2] Gas Leak


Hi again,

I recently noticed a gas leak in my Type2.  It was leaking from a small
piece of fuel line right on to the muffler.. I guess I am lucky I didn't
burn up my bus because I had noticed a gas smell for some time and never saw
the leak before.

Anyways, I fixed the faulty fuel line (and checked all other lines) and all
seems well.  The question I have is this.  I replaced my fuel line with a
new piece of regular fuel line... and after some research in the Type2_dot_com
library, I see that I should have used special fuel injection fuel line.  Is
this a must?  Do I need to replace my new fuel line with fuel injection
line?.. The piece I replaced is only 2 inches long... is this something I
need to be worried about?


Thanks
