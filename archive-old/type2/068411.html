Subject: RE: Bus Heater Controls

&gt;&gt;The function of the heater levers is a mystery. Can anyone tell 
&gt;&gt;me. what the 2 red and one blue levers do?
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;The blue one controls the two 'fresh-air flaps' in the front.  Up is
&gt;closed, down is open.  For the red levers, the right one
&gt;controls how much heat gets into the car.  Down is heat on and
&gt;when the lever is all the way down, the blower fan in the engine
&gt;compartment is supposed to come on.  The left lever controls which vents
&gt;the heat comes out of.
&gt;
&gt;PS -- If you think those are confusing, don't buy a Vanagon :)
&gt;

I thought it was just me!  I've driven my '85 Vanagon daily for almost a 
year now and when I need heat, I still resort to randomly moving the levers 
back and forth in various combinations until I feel something come out. The 
hieroglyphic labeling is useless, and the operation counterintuitive. 
But at least, unlike my old bus, I am in fact rewarded with heat when I  
get the combination right!  :)
