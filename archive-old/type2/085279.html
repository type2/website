Subject: [VB] tranny drain plug trick


For $1.16 I made a little tool today to get the drain and fill plugs out of
my '65

1 - 3&quot; Automotive bolt with a 17mm head
2  17mm nuts


The two nuts lock each other, so vise grips on the bottom one loosens, on
the top
one, tightens
Not one flaps, or even VW dealer even knew what I was talking about
when I asked about a 3/8 17mm hex socket.  The Foriegn Flaps guy said
&quot;you'll never find anything like that out here&quot; (CT).  So I made this little
thing and it's worked good so far. Will still order the socket from someone
for safe re-tightening

Just thought I'd share my small triumph
