How do you know it's running hot? Oil temps? Head temps? Or seat of the
pants? Anyway, the best way to access under the tins is to remove the HEs
and fan shroud. Easier than dropping the engine.

The voltage drop at the coil is due to the long run of wiring from the
battery to the ignition switch and back to the coil. Between the 30 year old
wiring and the 30 year old switch you've got some resistance being
introduced into the current. I believe the reason it's even lower when
running is because the coil is drawing its own power beyond what your switch
and wire are able to provide. I know I say this all the time, but run a wire
directly from the battery positive terminal to the coil positive terminal as
a test. See if things improve.

Do you have a functional thermostat? Make sure the flaps are opening and
closing all the way. If no thermostat, make sure the spring is holding the
flaps fully open. If no flaps, GET THEM. You oil cooler depends on the flaps
to direct some of the cooling air to it.

You said your points were changing. (22 what?) If your condensor is going
bad you'll see that. Swap in new points AND condensor.

And finally, you have a center mounted carb with no manifold heat. You may
be running into fuel condensation causing the bus to run lean. Lean = Hot.
After a run in the bus, while it's still idling, run back and touch the
intake manifold runners. I'll bet they're pretty darn cold.

Let us know how it goes!
