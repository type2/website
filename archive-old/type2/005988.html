Subject: Could someone help me out...
Message-ID: &lt;01BE8DE3.601787C0_at_QNCYB302-06.splitrock_dot_net&gt;

Hello, sorry for the non-type2 content, but i thought some of you vw  buffs out there could help me out.
My girlfriend just bought a 1987 VW Cabriolet Convertible.
She needs a new shifter knob and a boot to hold the top down
I have been looking all over the web for a distributor with these parts,  but have not been able to find anything!
If anyone knows of somewhere that offers these products at a reasonable  price, could you let me know please...
thanks alot
