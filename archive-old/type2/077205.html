Subject: Re: [T2] Engine-neering - combustion chamber question

I thought that was the reason car makers at that time were adding air 
injection pumps to motors - to keep oxygen levels in the exhaust high 
enough that the exhaust by-products would continue to combust and thus 
clean up the exhaust emissions. As I recall the air injectors were in the 
exhaust manifolds someplace.

Was it wasteful? Dunno - however I do know that my 120 HP 1966 Mustang with 
a 200 c.i. 6 cylinder was much more powerful than my 90 HP 1981 Mustang 
with the same 200 c.i. 6 cylinder. In other words they choked the engine 
down with emissions equipment to make it cleaner. It had the air pump too. 
I doubt that they would have reduced the HP if they didn't have to make it 
that way. Gas mileage was a bit worse than the 1966 which was very worn out 
and geared lower.

I'm learning...

&gt;Isn't it combustion that forces the piston to move. If this combustion
&gt;continued in the exhaust imagine what the emisions levels would
&gt;be.

&gt; &gt; &gt;I was told once that the elbows were &quot;afterburner&quot; pipes for the late
&gt; &gt; &gt;baywindows and that they go very, very hot b/c combustion was continuing
&gt; &gt; &gt;inside the pipes.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;What'cha think?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I think that if true, it's rather inefficient.  Anyone else have info on
&gt; &gt; this?  Is it any different than with other engines?
