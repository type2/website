dear tom,

try it, drive it, what have you got to lose. take it easy, leave a little
earlier and put up with not having the comfort of the honda. 30 miles a day is
nothing. youll be proud of yourself. put your money into a vehicle that will
hold its value, last forever, and has sentimental meaning rather than some car
that means nothing and will end up in a junk yard one day. youve had this bus
a long time, keep it forever, 
 youll be glad you did.............
