Subject: '72 starter/switch problem
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

Hi all,
When I went out to start the bus on this morning the bus started and then
died.  Not terribly unusual since it's about 10 degrees out and I haven't
hooked the chokes up yet for the winter.  So I tried starting it again and
this time the starter would not disengage.  In fact the starter kept turning
over the engine with the key off.  So I ran around and frantically got the
ground strap off.

This is a 2 day old reman starter.  When I got it it had paint overspray on
the pinion shaft.  I took this off with some solvent.  I then put a thin
coat of grease on the pinion shaft, both where the gear runs and where it
fits in the bushing.  Could this grease, once cold, be the cause of my
problems?  Would this cause it to keep turning over the engine even with the
key out?  Or would that suggest switch problems?

How do I test the switch with my handy multimeter?

More background:  Good battery, starter/engine bolts tight.

Thanks in advance,
-C
