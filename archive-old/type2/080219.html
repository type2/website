&gt; moisture catalyzing the acceleration of the materials decay?  If so then

? not sure, Baltimore is hardly a dry climate

&gt; i have a theory though that it may be the result of driving with greasy or
&gt; oily hands and the oil irepairably damages the foam, it makes sense, i
&gt; know i have driven after making roadside reapirs with filthy hands.
&gt; anyone have any support for that idea?

I just thought it was the dirt I left there days earlier rubbing back off
