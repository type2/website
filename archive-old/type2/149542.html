Subject: Re: [T2] Dwell Creep

I'll be dingered.... the spring's missing. Can anyone tell me the specific 
name so I know what to ask for? Or maybe the specific specs  of the spring 
in case they might have a generic at the FLAPS?

I'm assuming that the spring compresses the dist. shaft to keep it from 
jumping around?

&gt;
&gt; &gt; If you look in the base of the dist drive dog and the top of the drive
&gt; &gt; gear in the engine you will see a hole in each about 4-5 mm in diameter.
&gt; &gt; the spring sits in these holes.  It looks a lot like a spring from a
&gt; &gt; ball point pen on serious steroids (~4mm diameter coil and ~2cm long).
&gt;
&gt;OOK!
