Subject: my first issue of camper and commercial

It just arrived in a plain brown envelop that had me confused until i 
opened it.  FANTASTIC mag.  Vantastic article (spelling as meant) on the 
start (creation) of the bus.  Very wide ranging topics from mt shasta 
climb (CAL) to Aussie busses.  When i first put my subscription in I was 
wondering about the cost.  Not any more!  Worth it!
Now why cant American publishers put out anything even close?  Logged in 
and submitted for a subs (in dollars  even) after seeing it discussed 
here.
