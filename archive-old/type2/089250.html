Subject: Trippin'!!! check out this online road trip about to happen!

Nick sent me a link to his website detailing his trip him and his friend are
about to embark in their restored 72 camper. Might prove to be interesting
since it will be updated on the road with pics, money spent, etc etc.
Thought all the people that asked about how people afford roadtrips the last
time this thread came up, might enjoy this.
