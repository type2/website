Folks,

The prodigal son returns to place his problems at your feet.....

My 78 fuel injected bus starts just fine when it is cold (30-60 degrees F).
It runs well for about 15 or 20 minutes. After 15 or 20 minutes, the engine
cuts out and the headlights turn off. If I sit and wait for a while, the
lights turn on and it runs well until it gets warm again.

During the period when it is cooling off, sometimes the starter will crank
and sometimes it won't.

I looked for a vacuum leak but couldn't find any. Should I keep looking for
a vacuum leak or start looking at the electrical system?
