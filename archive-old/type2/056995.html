Subject: Re: The 77 westy gas prob and grief for a lost friend

&gt;Today though I must start to do something and I figured I would try and
&gt;work on my bus.  I am completely mystified by the concept of vapor 
lock,
&gt;if anyone can explain what this means I would (and I am sure others as
&gt;well) appreaciate it. 
&gt;
Vapor lock is a simple concept.  It is when the fuel lines get so hot 
(by proximity to exhaust parts or just on a really hot day) that the 
fuel inside vaporizes.  Well clearly fuel vapor doesn't pump like liquid 
fuel does, so the engine stalls because it's not getting enough/any 
fuel.  This is vapor lock.

That said, vapor lock is pretty much unheard of in fuel injected engines 
(what your '77 should have).  This is because the fuel injection system 
keeps the fuel in the lines under about 30 psi at all times.  And we 
know from our high school physics classes that liquids under pressure 
boil at higher temperatures (same principle as a water-cooled car's 
pressurized cooling system) and so it takes a lot more heat to get the 
fuel in the lines to vaporize.

It is more common with carbureted engines as only a short section of the 
total fuel line is pressurized (between the mechanical pump and the 
carburetor) and the pressure is minimal, like 3-5 psi.
