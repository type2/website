&gt; That's what mine looks like now because it snapped on the road. I had a

I've done mine the same way.  Used a long bolt with a plain shank so that
the threads weren't bearing the load and  nylock nut to keep it in place.

I've also had to weld and redrill the hole that the pin goes through.
It just wasn't designed to last for hundreds of kilomiles.  I'd like to
devise a &quot;forever&quot; solution for this.  A bronze bushing seems like a good
idea.  At least it would be replacable.
