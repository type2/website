Subject: Re: [T2] heater box removal

Corbett asked:


Who sells pipes that I can replace my heater boxes with? I want to do away
with the stock heater system since I have a gas heater and would like to sell
the heater boxes that I have and just replace them with some kind of pipe
setup. They used to make a J pipe for bugs, do they make a similar setup for
buses?

I have read a few replies to this question but none addressed the cooling system problem you will be facing
when you remove the heater box shielding or the lost bottom support for your alternator bracket.

Got a thermostat?  It needs the front lower tin and the pushrod tin to function properly. Otherwise, with all
the cold air going by it, the engine will never run with the flaps in the warm position. The flaps will always
believe the engine is cold.

Do you have a never ending supply of alternator support brackets? Without the bottom end firmly supported, the
top end constantly breaks.
