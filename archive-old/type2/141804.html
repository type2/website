Subject: '71 seats

Hello listees,

	My wife has been after me to replace the seats in our 71 camper with
seats that have head rests, for safety reasons.  Does anyone know of any
seats, with head rests, that will fit the '71 seat rails?  Another thought
was that maybe there is a seat back from another year bus, with head rests,
that would be a direct replacement for the 71 seat backs.  And my last idea
involves building some sort of padded head rest that would attach to the
partions behind the seats.  Well, any info you can send my way will be
greatly appreciated.
