Subject: Last call for JBB t-shirts

Hey everyone,

I just went up to check out the campground for John Brown's Buses and it's
very nice. Right on the Potomac river, not far from the town of Brunswick,
basketball court, horseshoe pits, and a decent bathhouse.

Anyway just a reminder that JBB is Oct 6,7,8 to coincide with Railroad Days in
Brunswick.

This is the last call for those of you that want to preorder t-shirts. I will
have some to sell at the campground. If you want to preorder send me an email
with your size and if you want long or short sleeve. The prices are the same
as last year $15 for short and $20 for long.

Hope to see you there.

Sharon
