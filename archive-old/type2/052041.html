Hi all...

I know its not Friday, but am very proud of my project and wanted to share
too.

I have a 1973 Westfalia that my brother gave me.  It is a daily driver and I
think its about a C to a B overall.  The entire drive train have been gone
through.  I am currently gathering up the stuff for a Gary Miller injection
system.  I hope to have that and my pop top overhaul done by the spring meet
Pyuallup (funds permitting).

I'm looking forward to meeting as many of you as I can, thanks for such a
great source of inspiration and general VW support!
