Since nobody else responded:

Aircraft engines also employ precision machining on the vertically split
crankcase surfaces.  Since the addition of a gasket would create all
kinds of tolerance stackup issues, they are assembled without.  Before
the age of 'Better living through Chemistry' sealants the trick to
making a crankcase oil tight was to lay a silk thread around the
periphery of the crankcase just before bolting it up.  The thread is
easily crushed, and doesn't affect the assembly dimensionally, but it
does help seal up any tiny flaws or mismatches in the mating edges.
