Subject: Cheap buses

I can't believe you are telling someone to spend $500 or less on a bus.
You must have alot of time on your hands to fix up these buses cause
anything that cheap is a project. I spent $2,000 on my '71 bus that was in
great shape but only had a stock engine 12yrs ago. I've put thousands into
the engine, body,seats, etc. I'm about to sell it and I'm going to be
asking $4,500. You get what you pay for.

&gt;&gt;The '72 Westy here that I  can't get for a
&gt;&gt;penny under 4k is going to cost another 2500 bucks to get the windshield
rust
&gt;&gt;problem and a couple of other spots and dings fixed and then painted. It
does
&gt;&gt;have a pancake w/12k on it, but I'll still have 6500 in the thing and
some of
&gt;&gt;you have already said that's too much.
&gt;
&gt;Forget about this bus. Anybody who isn't budging when you wave 3800 cash
under
&gt;his nose, is not the type of person you want to buy a bus from. He's too
worried
&gt; about
&gt;the bottom line, or he's too attached to it to let it go. Not only that,
but 12k
&gt; on a rebuilt pancake
&gt;isn't any great shakes. Just to believe that was true you'd want to check the
&gt;odometer, all his
&gt;receipts and ask detailed questions about the rebuild. If he bought a
longblock
&gt;from GEX, well
&gt;he should pay YOU for the bus.
&gt;
&gt;In other words, you don't want to spend a huge amount on a bus. The most I
ever
&gt;spent was $1500
&gt;for my first bus, which was mint, but it was a mistake, because I didn't
know a
&gt;thing about keeping it alive and ended
&gt;up losing it anyway. After that I found a copy of the Idiot book and read
it a
&gt;few times, then paid $100 for a 77,
&gt;$100 for a 69, $125 for a 78, $100 for 66, $350 for an 80, $400 for
another 66,
&gt;$0 for a 73, $0 for a 71, and now I'm
&gt;planning on paying $500 for a 72, which is the most I'll throw down, knowing
&gt;I'll have to sink several hundred in parts
&gt;to get it rolling.
&gt;
&gt;If you aren't willing to study the books, buy the parts and fix it
yourself, it
&gt;not economical to own a bus, and even when
&gt;you are willing to do all the repairs, the economics are questionable, unless
&gt;you develop an eye for  a bus with potential.
&gt;I've had the best luck with the buses I've paid the least for...!  I'd
look on
&gt;the various bus classifieds on the internet, and
&gt;wait for something affordable but not mint, and in the meantime read the
book!
