&gt;The temp issue is not an issue except at or near

I just want to point out that EGR only operates at part throttle.  At idle and full throttle, your engine will run the same (not hotter, or cleaner) with or without EGR.

I ran EGR briefly on my bus back when I first got it, in order to pass California emissions.  I took it off when I found that my bus was a Federal-spec bus (not originally sold in Cali) and therefore did not require the EGR (or so said the smog station).  I ran without it for the next 15 years so I feel safe in saying that it will not cause a problem to remove it.

And I also do not like using full throttle for extended periods.  It may be silly, but that's just the way I am.
