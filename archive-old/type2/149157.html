&gt;I noticed from your ad that you installed AVP heads back in 2002.  I'm 
&gt;guessing that your problem is with the AVP heads.

Probably. By the sound of it there are quite a few unsatisified customers out there, myself included.

&gt;I'm now running new AMC heads with stainless valves from Boston Engine. 
&gt;So far, so good, but I'm still crossing my fingers.. and toes.. and 
&gt;anything else that I can think of. 

It seems the AMC heads are problmeatic according to Raby and GoWesty but if you redo the valve job and replace the valves a la Boston Bob you get a good head.
