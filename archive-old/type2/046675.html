Subject: [T2] Vibrations and noises from rear?

For the past 8000 miles or so I've been noticing an increasing vibration from 
the rear of my 73 Westy.  I've had the tires balanced and even rotated them and 
that had no effect on the vibration whatsoever.  The vibration is MUCH more 
noticable under accelleration and even more so while going around a curve (left 
seems to be worse than right, but both directions do it).  More recently, I've 
also begun noticing a distinct, loud clicking sound from the back end while 
going around corners.

So, are these symptoms associated with rear bearings going bad or just CV's?  
I've never replace the rear bearings and they're bound to have about 240k miles 
on them.  CV's have about 20k on them and were regreased about 10k miles ago.

Any comments or ramblings on noises/vibrations associated with rear bearings 
greatly appreciated.
