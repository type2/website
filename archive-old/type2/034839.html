Subject: sliding door rust

Hey,
I had the same problem on my 70 bus. Got a donor bus and my husband took
a sawsall and cut out the entire area for the bottom channel for the
sliding door. We took it to a body shop near us (Northern Virginia) and
they cut out our old rust one and welded in the donor one. Painted
everything (the channel, the sliding door and both front and rear rocker
panels) all the the low low price of $500.
