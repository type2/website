&gt;       Skip the frying pan...Wrap in aluminum foil and wire to the
&gt; heat exchanger...Cooks in ten minutes or ten miles, whichever
&gt; comes first... ;-)

I tried this a couple times... in the aircooled Volks bus....it is hard to 
put food under the engine...
I put it in a tin fry basket..placed it approx where the thermostat is 
located..  general area and found out it really doesn't get hot in the 
&quot;breadbox&quot;..

Then I put the food above the engine tin ,, in the intake area... it really 
stays cooool there,,, that is where the cooling air is circulating.

And,, to booot.. I thought I had it perfect,, a 1 hr drive,, at 350 deg head 
temps...
about 100kms ..... at about 120 kms hr.. the engine runs 350 deg which 
sounded just like the oven temps.
The drive took a little longer as there was traffic which slowed me down, 
which lowered the engine bay temperature , as the head temps didn't get over 
300 deg.

I assumed there would be heat transfer from the head to the tin to the 
cooking tray.    Not enough to make the chicken even warm to touch.

I have tried it successfully in a 68 Econoline Van,, it has the oven 
[engine] lid between the passenger and the driver seat... you can place the 
food on top of the heating element [exhaust manifold]... wait 10 minutes,, 
open the lid,,, flip it over.. wait 10 minutes and it is ready to eat!   All 
without stopping.

I shouldn't tell the truth about this ,, as I know I have a reputation as 
the guy who cooked the chicken on the way to the picnic....lol  but in 
reality,, it was cooked before I left home... I was just hoping to keep it 
warm on the engine.... and wasn't even sucessful at that.   I had to warm it 
on the bar-bee
