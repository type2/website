There is no right answer, but it just ties in with my feelings that VWOA is

about making money and not about making a people's car anymore.


I don't mean to upset anyone though. Just offering my opinion. I apreciate

your's too.  :0) &gt;&gt;

I doubt that any major car maker is interested in making a &quot;people's car&quot;
any more. The days of the Beetle, the 2CV, etc. are pretty much over,
at least in America. Malcolm Bricklin claims to be coming back, but that
remains to be seen. Fiat is on the ropes and may soon be just another GM
division, too. It has a great deal to do with cost, unless the manufacturer
can sell millions, the profit margin just isn't there anymore. It also has to
do with image...Nobody wants to be associated with a cheap (low-cost) 
car, for fear that the cheap (low-quality) image will carry over to its
higher priced and more profitable lines and models.
