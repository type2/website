Subject: Can you turn on the heat already?

Well, its not quite an issue yet but, it will be soon enough.  While
working on sealing up my heating system, I've stumbled onto a few
snags.  The flaps on the fan shroud are gone.  I'm not sure that I
ever had them but, I can't find them in my box of junk.  Anyone know
where to get them?  I really can't see why they matter but, I've seen
a few references mentioning their importance.  Also, I made some new
gaskets for the plates that cover this area on both sides.  This has
helped eliminate some of the air passing around the shroud/heat
exchanger connection but, I still have some air escaping.  Was there
ever any other type of gasket in this area?  Maybe around the bottom
of the heat exchanger?  My heat exchangers are leaking at both ends
but, I don't have the money to replace them for this winter.  I will
replace them before next year though.  I have some flexible RTV
silicone that I'm going to try to use to seal up both ends of the heat
exchangers.  I hope it will last until spring.  If anyone has tried
another solution that worked well, I'd like to hear it.  Both of my
flapper boxes are hurtin'.  One has large holes so I wired it wide
open and cut the vent off.  I seal it up with a piece of sheet metal.
 It seems pretty good now - it doesn't have much of a choice though.
Where can one find the flappers that are OEM quality and still
affordable?  Also, are the seals between the flappers and the heat
mufflers available?  I can't seem to find them unless I'm calling them
the wrong thing.  I've seen a couple of mentions about using the
silicone seals from vanagons - are those available new?  After sealing
up several of the connections, I have much better air flow to the dash
but, I know it can be better as I still feel lots of air pushing
around some of the joints.

Thanks in advance,
Ken
