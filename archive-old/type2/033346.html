    Greetings everybody!  I do not recall finding a spring between the dizzy

and dizzy drive while stripping my engine.  Could the engine have run
without 
one?  Does anyone know where I can get one? I am thinking of using a spare 
oil control valve spring.  I recall some book saying that it would work. 
Finally, does anyone know exactly what purpose this spring serves?  Any help

would be greatly appreciated.  Thanks, Pete
