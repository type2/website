Subject: oil screen fixed/case #'s

Thanks for the input on the oil screen!  The problem was that someone 
had indeed installed an insert on the oil pipe.  I got to see how the 
pipe was suppossed to look when I went back to the parts shop today.  The 
insert around the pipe came off pretty easily by prying with a 
screwdriver.  Once the insert was removed the filter went on with a few 
gentle taps of a hammer.

I checked the engine number to determine if I had the correct screen (I 
did) and discovered that my engine number (AE441333) is not listed in the 
idiot guide.  The guys at the shop said it must be a universal case.  Is 
there any way to learn more about my motor (year, size, etc) without a 
factory number?
