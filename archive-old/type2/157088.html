&gt; &gt;Why spend
&gt; &gt; $500 for a Heathkit TV when you can get the same thing assembled for $400?
&gt; &gt; Good for consumers, but bad for gearheads.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; What do geek kids do these days?  Video games 24/7?
&gt;
&gt; Not sure if this was a rhetorical question or not but..as a &quot;geek kid&quot;
&gt; (Is 24 still a &quot;kid&quot;?) here's a few things my fellow geeks and I do:
&gt; 1) Linux - A spiffy customizable operating system
&gt; 2) Overclocking/Watercooling your computer
&gt; 3) Build robots/battlebots
&gt; 4) Programming (I don't do this personally but many of my fellow geek
&gt; crowd does)

It was somewhat rhetorical, but you answer is pretty much right on the
money.  I came across a magazine called &quot;Make&quot; http://makezine_dot_com/ that
is kind of like the olde skool Popular Mechanics when folks were
actually expected to build things.  Problem is, this magazine is mondo
expensive (like $10 an issue) so I doubt that it will be very widely read.
