&gt; FWIW, I'm inclined to agree with your supposition - that the concern
is
&gt; not only with exhaust gases under pressure, but also what's coming out
&gt; the tailpipe and has the potential for getting sucked into
&gt; negative-pressure in the heat exchangers if a &quot;pull&quot; rather than a
&gt; &quot;push&quot; blower is used.

I'm inclined to favor placing the blower in the engine bay for the
following reasons:

1. Cleanliness.  The entire heating system will be under positive
pressure, keeping dust and exhaust fumes out of the heat (as long as
the engine bay is properly sealed).  The air in the engine bay is
bound to be cleaner than the air under the bus that would be sucked
into the system.

2. Noise.  I want to keep the blower as far away from the passenger
end of the duct as possible.

3. Recirculation.  If you want to go to a recirculating system, blower
placement at the rear provides the opportunity to install an intake
duct at the rear of the bus.

Possible disadvantages of rear blower placement is the need to keep
the blower on &quot;low&quot; while the heater is off, to keep air flowing
through the heat exchangers.  Otherwise, the ductwork would provide a
&quot;chimney effect&quot; that would allow really hot air to get up into the
fan, possible to its detriment.  Type 4's got around this with a set
of flapper valves that allowed engine fan air to pass through the
exchangers when the fan was off.
