The parts arrived late last night. I'm on day 43 of a 10-day temp inspection
sticker. I changed the date 3 times and and the
month once with no trouble, but there's no easy way to change APR to MAY so
again I'm up against it. Change 3 of the four
rubber brake lines and the right rear metal brake line, which had stripped and
snapped. My shoes don't fit. Have to send
them back to the Depot. I think they have trouble with the 72 shoes. New
cylinders, stars, screws and star anchor plates
went in okay, except knocking the old star anchors off with a pickle fork and 5
lb sledge was causing some consternation with my 95 year old neighbor, even
though it was only 9pm - I agreed to call the operation off until this
afternoon.
