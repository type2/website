&gt;How in the world do you put Fuel Injection in a dual carbed beast??

It would have to be engineered, or fabricated and trial and errored to
death. The 1.7L never was delivered with FI. Then, of course, it wouldn't
be stock, where the highest value to the most is found. Why?? Cause it's
easy to make stock work right.
