Subject: Re: [T2] fan hub spacer removal

Point taken, guys.

But believe me, nobody has taken good care of this engine until now.  I am
doing my best to get it right.  I have had to replace 90% of the tin, there
was no functional engine seal, etc, etc.  The old engine is going back to 
the rebuilder, but I doubt I will get my core deposit back.

&gt; I've got to go along with what David says, just be more careful.
&gt; Someone had given that 22 year engine good care to get it this far along.
&gt; Many people on the list have been doing the VW thing for over 30 years
&gt; and I've been at it for over eight years. 
&gt; If someone gives you questionable information or you get questionable
&gt; information from the archives just repost your request asking for a
&gt; better way.
