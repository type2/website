Just thought I'd jump into this one.

You mentioned your trans jumps out of 4th gear.  You made no mention that you
have difficulty shifting between gears, correct?

Once the gears are engaged, the syncros are out of play.  If you do not get
full engagement, the trans can jump out of gear.  Does it jump out of gear
under accelleration? At cruise? Or when you let off of the gas?  Does it
shift into gear just fine?

Replace the shift rod bushings, and the connector between the rod and
transmission. Adjust the shift plate.  Check for play in the motor mounts.

Remember, when you shift into R, 2nd, and 4th, the shift rod is pulled the
furthest forward.

If these adjustments do not fix your problem, and the gears do not grind
going into gear, you may be able to fix it by replacing the trans shift rod
(Hockey stick?) in the trans nosecone.  Prior to buying a rebuild, if you can
hold it in gear with a light touch, a bungi cord may serve you well for many
miles.  In the meantime, save a few bucks a month until you have to replace
the trans.  I would not have visions of a catastropic failure from what you
describe as the symptoms as of this time.
