Subject: Re: [T2] noise in rear of engine? 78 westy

Did you take your fan apart?

I did to bead blast it all
then painted the fan silver and the pulley part black.

and even though I thought I had put it back in balance, I was 1/4 off.
It was out of balance.

Just a thought-

Thanks!

&gt;Start up is loud and a knocking / rattling noise comes from the rear of the
engine.  Doesn't sound like a rod or a lifter but more erratic and louder.
like something banging around and rattling.  I put the stethoscope on and
couldn't find the noise.  put a pipe to my ear to listen and still can't tell
exactly but near the fan/ alternator area.

I did notice the fan belt bouncing quite a bit.  About 1&quot; flop ...  I had
just
tighten the belt.

What do you think about removing the belt and trying it?  that would
eliminate
the alternator and the belt right?
