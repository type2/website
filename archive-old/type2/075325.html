Subject: 76 teardown

listos:

thanks to all who responded to my 76 teardown thread, especially al brase who took my questions one by one.

as you may know, my #3 exhaust valve broke at the stem (is this &quot;sucking&quot; a valve?) and destroyed my head/piston.

conditions: I have time/money to do this right. (miracle of miracles!)

plan: 

1. replace all cylinders/pistons with new. how do I size these when I order them from someone? are they all 93mm?

2. should I:

get one new head to match my other with the 75-78 exhaust manifold, or would it be wiser to get a set of 72-74 with the more replaceable exhaust. Mind you, my other bus is a 79 with the same 72-74 type of exhaust, which would be nice for interchangeability.

or should I match the 75-78? I have to pass smog in califonia till at least 2006. do these exhausts change my chances of doing that, one versus the other? I know I need a cat on both.

3. I've decided to have the case split and inspected, but I don't know who to trust. I don't think I trust my regular &quot;keep it running&quot; guy for this one, and I didn't get a lot of feedback on CB. Can anyone recommend someone in the Fresno-Bakersfield california area?

Isn't there a &quot;karl&quot; on the list from fresno? And chuck meanly, I know you've been in the area to pick up your sundial, any thoughts?

List, you guys are great, and lets follow Dave R.'s advice and not use the list to get out our frustrations caused by others. Aren't we a team here?

thanks,

Bill
