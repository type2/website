Subject: Re: [T2] Leaking Valve Cover

Theodore,

I had this problem on my 78 as well.

The EPO(evil previous owner) had dipped the gaskets in rtv and then put
them on the bus...we all know this is the worst thing you can do.

Got them all scrapped off and started to look at the heads...*Lots* of
gunk from previous valve gaskets on the heads.  I spent probably 20
minutes per head with 600 grit wet dry sandpaper getting them down to real
metal.

No leaks since then.

Lay a straight edge on your valve covers and make sure they are flat
first.  

Gunk on sealing surface = leaks.

I personally install my gaskets with 3m weatherstrip adhesive on the valve
cover side.  They generally last 20,000 miles +

Cheers, dave

&gt; My right valve cover leaks.(78' type IV 2.0) New gaskets, still leaks.
&gt; Cover looks straight. I tried putting the bail in a vise and bending the
&gt; ends to a tighter curve. Now the bail fits a lot tighter but the sucker
&gt; still leaks. Not a lot just enough to piss me off and stink up my heat a
&gt; little. Im thinking its time for bolt on valve covers, but before I spend
&gt; the dough on that I thought I would ask you folks.
