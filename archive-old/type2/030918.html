I bought my first type 2 a 1960 in 1969, so I have been getting parts for
these things for many many years, I have used just about every company
that has hung out a shingle, none are perfect, the Bus Depot is IMO well
above average.

mostly right now I stick with the Depot and RMMW and FLAPS, and &quot;Crazy
Rays&quot; (pick and pull)

now GEX, huh, don't get me started.
