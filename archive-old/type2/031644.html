&gt; If you are really interested in knowing your 'exact' oil pressure, buy an

&gt; put out a 'guaranteed' indication(+-.2%!) alla time!  Now Thats accuracy!

but the real reason for the guages is to either spot immediate trouble, or
long term trends...both a guage that is consistent will do
adequately.  personally I don't really care if my oil is 213 or
217degrees. just as long as it always says the same thing at the same
indication...

. thus I see the sudden spike in temp, shut down the engine
or
. the gradual increase in temp that may indicate I need a tune up or some
other problem.

so if I know the guage is &quot;close&quot; and it is consistent I can learn my
engine and what the guage says when it is happy.   My engine seems to like
to run best at just a little over 200.  so when the guage says 210 I'm
happy the engine is happy and if the real temp is 203 I don't really worry
about it as long as every time the real temp in 203 it reads a consistent
210 or whatever.

or you can be the type person who misses the scenery because they are
watching the guages all the time
