Subject: Re: [T2] Carpet glue removal

One of the great (and cheap) cleaning solvents  (which works well on
removing 3m adhesive) is Coleman camp stove gasoline. It is completely
odorless and leaves no residue. I buy it a Dick's for around $3.25 a gallon.
It's great for cleaning anything greasy as well. At the price you can't beat
it.

Cheers,

David,
Try 3-M adhesive remover.
It won't attack the paint----

Later,

The PO glued carpet around the bases of both my drivers and passenger
seats, I removed the carpet, but am having a hell of a time getting the
glue off... Is there any easier/better way to remove it than sanding it
off? I'd like to paint them to have them match the rest of the interior
(as they are still the gold/yellow color) or should I just recarpet them
to match the new carpet?
Thanks!
