Subject: Rejetting a 30/31 PICT Solex....

Hey All,

I've grown tired of the lack of power my aging 1600 sp is delivering
and would like to re-jet my 30/31 Solex. I live at relatively high
altitude (5,500 ft) that, combined with the less restricted flow of my
S&amp;S exhaust lead me to believe jumping up a notch or two might help.
The problem is that I can't seem to locate any jets! Seems they aren't
available.

Someone on the list mentioned using Mikuni jets? What size would I
need and are there different styles of Mikuni jets, or are they all
the same?

My other option is to install my Kadrons (new, in box), but I've got
sp heads and dp manifolds. At one time I tried installing them using a
set of used sp manifolds, but the drivers side carb mechanism bound up
on the cooling tin and I returned the manifolds, as I didn't want to
alter the tin. I now have no access to those manifolds, as I've since
moved to another state. Anyone got a set to sell?
