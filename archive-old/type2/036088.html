Subject: valve adjusting [FRI]

Dave,    I was introduced to Peasantswagening around 1963, by a great old
guy who gave me a gift subscription to MOTOR SPORT.  During a trip to
England, he had met William Boddy, then editor, whose writing style was
delightful.  I learned a whole new language, including windscreen, gudgeon
pin, big end, boot, bonnet, and hood....  At that time there were few
English-language manuals on VW; he had found one from Australia.  I remember
feeling the light click on when he explained his valve setting technique,
beginning with my translation of 'Zundfolge 1-4-3-2' as he wrote out
1-4-3-2-1-4-3-2 and drew a box around 4-3-2-1.........  Of course you know
the rest.  I've always set VW valves this way; just can't understand why
anyone would want the mental baggage of doing it any other way.....  DeWayne
&quot;Dewey&quot; Alter, thanks for your kind tutelage.  I hope you've found smooth
roads and free petrol in your part of Heaven.

Dave and List -- Thanks for listening to nostalgic ramblings.
