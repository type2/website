Subject: Why is my oil cooler still leaking?

Hey Guys,

I just started the bus up (I promised my girlfriend I wouldn't work on the bus
today, but she just made a trip to Walmart so I cheated).

The oil cooler is still leaking!

I just removed all those pieces to get to the oil cooler and replace the
seals.  My local VW shop said they would check the cooler if I brought it in,
which they supposively did?  The old seals were obviously shot, so I'm
wondering if they actually hooked the cooler up to their tester?
I can see the seal locations and they don't seem to be leaking.  The oil
sending unit seems to be dry as well... There is just a steady slow drip
coming from the left front corner of the oil cooler.  Do these develope
leaks?
I don't remember seeing an oil leak when I first bought the bus, but I only
drove it for about ten minutes before I dismantled everything for the resto.
Anyways, as you guys know it's a real pain to remove the oil cooler...so how
would you go about fixing this leak?  Could the leak be coming from somewhere
else or do you think it's most likely the cooler?

Thanks,

Tom
