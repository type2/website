Subject: what tires for upgraded 15&quot; rims?
Content-type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII
Content-transfer-encoding: 7bit

I've just bought a set of 15x6.5&quot; rims for my 77 bus.  Has anyone else
upgraded their bus to larger rims?  I'm wondering what tires to run on these
rims.  Finding reinforced tires for 15&quot; rims is even harder then finding the
reinforced 185r14 tires that were stock.  Has anyone tried un-reinforced
205/65/15 passenger car tires on these rims?  Does the bus handle
better/worse?  I called TireRack and they reccomended the reinforced Goodyear
tires that come on the Eurovan.  The problem is that they are $102 each!!
I've also heard that they are not very good tires.  Suggestions?
Thanks,
Neal
