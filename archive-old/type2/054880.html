 I have a '72 bus and I am wondering what to do
&gt;about the swaying that happens at high speeds, such as over 55 MPH?

&gt;just seems that when I am on the freeway, the bus feels like it is moving all
&gt;over the road.  Is this normal?

yes, it's a bus !  especially in the wind, or when being passed by a semi.
didja' ever try to carry a sheet of plywood on a windy day ?!

 I went to a mechanic whom has a good
&gt;reputation and he did a bunch of work and said that I still needed the new
&gt;tires and four ball joint boots for the front end four ball joint boots, drag
&gt;link and steering box.

bus boys has those boots. do you need a drag link and steering box ?!!
or just the boots...
