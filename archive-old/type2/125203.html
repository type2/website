Subject: Re: [T2] Which throwout bearing to use?

Michael wrote:


 We decided to use a late tranny with its bell housing on the 75
requiring use of a later starter.  The earlier setup had an early bell
housing, a 215 clutch setup, and a new throwout bearing with a smaller
&quot;set in&quot; face that rotates.  The later tranny has a throwout with a
wider rotating face- can I use this on the earlier pressure plate? (I
assume one cannot use the early throwout bearing with the larger 228
clutch!)  Of the throwouts laying around, I noticed some allow the
bearing part to be pushed around with the fingers within its housing- is
that normal or undesireable?

One bearing fits all diaphragm bus clutches from 71 to 92. Some have wide faces, some have narrow faces. I am
a little confused by Bus Depot listing the 113 151 165A as the bus bearing. This bearing is for a type 1 from
71 up. Bus Boys shows this same bearing for the bus also.
VW says it should be a 088 141 165 A from 71 to 79 buses.
OE VDub says 088 141 165 B for buses 71 to 92..... not sure where they got the B from.
Vanagon part number is 091 141 165 D.

I have 2 different Sachs 228 pressure plates with 2 different size openings where the fingers end.
One T.O. bearing fits either one.

Not sure what you mean by your last sentence. But if the bearing has any side movement, consider it a
paperweight :)
