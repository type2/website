Subject: still no start (FI '77): ideas?
Message-ID: &lt;KOHFMONPGLAFAAAA_at_theglobe_dot_com&gt;

Well, I still don't have a running bus. Symptoms: tries to start then immediately dies--that is, she'll fire up, but only run for a second or two. Have to wait about 5 minutes between starts.

Something interesting I discovered, when I checked the brain plug today...I forgot to plug it back in and the thing fired up the same as always...so I'm seeing no difference with the brain plugged in or removed. I have tested with a spare brain (ECU) and I didn't see any difference. I tested the ECU wiring harness and couldn't find anything wrong with it. I'm wondering if it's a wiring thing that I've done wrong somewhere. I found an interesting post/reply in the archives that I thought might be promising (http://vw.i405_dot_com/sm.asp?path=\type2_at_type2\9705\115)--it spoke of a bad ground to the ECU--but that didn't pan out either. I ran a ground wire straight from on of the screws on the back of the ECU to ground with no luck whatsoever.

I have done most every test I can think of and they've all passed. I have checked and quadruple-checked every vacuum line, including the brake booster line. I've racked my brain on electrical connections and although I wonder if something's hooked up wrong, I can't find a problem.

I have NOT checked fuel pressure because I don't have a gauge...though I'm thinking about testing volume to determine if that's okay. I have, however, checked to see if the pump runs when I press the flap in the air flow meter and it does. I know I'm getting pressure because I saw it on my cold start valve when I checked the spray on that. I haven't gotten around to checking for fuel at my injectors, which John Anderson suggested, but I guess I'll go do that right now. That would be pretty stupid to omit that test in light of all I've already tested. And I guess that *could* be it, considering they get a signal via the resistor block (forgot what it's really called)--btw, I *DID* test that resistor block and it passed too.

Please let me know if you have ideas. I'll check the injectors right now.

Thanks! Joe
