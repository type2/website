Subject: VW Being Auctioned

Listees
  There is a '74 VW bus (not a camper) being sold at auction (along with
other abandoned vehicles) tomorrow Sat. Nov. 14th, (auction starts at 10:30
am) at RDU Airport in Raleigh, North Carolina.  Went out and looked at it
this morning.  It has what appears to be a '71 front nose assemble and front
bumper, but '74 body the rest of the way.  Has a type 4 engine with dual
carbs, straight shift, good glass, fair body, mostly trashed inside (missing
speedometer, ripped seats, etc).  Apparently it was driven to the airport
parking lot and abandoned so I would guess that the engine ran at that time.
The auctioneer said some of the abandoned vehicles had been sitting as long
as 3 years.  This vehicle has extra emergency flasher and rear window
defroster switches in the glove compartment.  Cannot attempt to start it
because note on window says 'broken ignition switch'.  Unless a VW
enthusiest happened to see it in the 'auctions' section of the newspaper
classifieds I would bet that it will sell for less than $100.   If anyone is
interested it will be sold tomorrow.  If you want to ask me any questions
about it e-mail me, or call at 919-362-9686.  Just hate to see all those
parts get crushed when someone may be able to use them, or even get the
whole thing running and back on the highways.
                                                       Bill (SO of Janyce)
