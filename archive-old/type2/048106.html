or not but I've done the same thing many times!
Seem I can tell if the engine is burning or leaking by smelling at the
intake.
Anyone notice that depending on how you are parked , the smell is stronger
on one side than the other?
Any wind pushes the smell through to the other side. I think a properly
sealed engine compartment helps with this flow.
The engine intake grills are about the correct height as you walk past.(nose
level) but I don't think this was planned:)
