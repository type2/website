Subject: Re: [T2] Locked up #1 main bearing  

----- Original Message ----- 
From: &quot;Airic&quot; &lt;airic_at_midsouth.rr_dot_com&gt;

&gt; What should I be looking for or should I just scrap the case and crank, or
&gt; just one of them?


Eric... basically you have had the same problem twice ,,,, can you tell if 
that bearing is getting oil?

I would be inclined to think the oil passage sending oil to that bearing may 
be plugged?

my guess,,
