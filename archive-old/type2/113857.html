&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Hi Gang,
&gt;    I know it short notice, but if anyone within a few hundred
&gt;miles of Stockbridge Mass isn't doing anything this coming Sunday (18th)
&gt;Arlo Guthrie is looking for a few buses (and of course drivers) to
&gt;help out with his Walk-a-thon for Huntington's Disease.   Basically we
&gt;need about 8 buses to be parked along the 6 mile route to offer assistance
&gt;if a walker needs it.  Then at the end they will be needed to
&gt;shuttle all the walkers back to the Guthrie Center in Hoosatonic.  The walking
&gt;route is basically Arlo's journey made famous in his song &quot;Alice's
&gt;Restaurant' Starting at the old church, now the Guthrie Center and ending
&gt;at the site of Alice's Restaurant in Stockbridge.  If anyone can help,
&gt;please Call me at work 800-457-1101 ask for Jim in parts.  I'll give
&gt;you Lisa Guthrie's (she's making the arrangements)  phone number to call
&gt;and let her know you'll be coming.  Thanks.
&gt;
&gt; PS:  If someone is on the Type 2 list, can you forward this message.
&gt; Thanks.
