Subject: CV inconsistency

My CV joint question is about the orientation of the
face of the body nearest the groove and the 'stepped'
(as opposed to flat)face of the hub.
Any relevant illustrations in Muir or Bentley show the
raised hub face and the &quot;groove' face of the body on
the same side of the assembly. This is consistent w
how I found all my 'VW Lobro' joints installed.

The new GKN/Lobro joint I just received from one of
our helpful participating suppliers is opposite, the
stepped face of the hub is opposite the 'groove' face
of the body. Customer service did check 2 other
joints, they were the same. They've had no problems
reported.

Probably not a problem, but the cv's being the greasy
PITA that they are, want to get it right the first
time. Any feedback appreciated.
Thanks
