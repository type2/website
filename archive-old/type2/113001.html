The right thing to do is to install a second battery, and hook up either 
a relay or an isolator. Bus Depot sells the hella dual battery relay, 
and sure power makes a nice isolator. You do not want to  hook the 
fridge to your primary battery unless the car is running, as that 
battery is not designed to be deep discharged, and the fridge will 
definitely do that pretty quickly.

That being said, running the fridge without the engine will not last 
that long. I can run mine about 12 hours before the deep cycle battery 
doesn't have enough in it anymore, assuming I am not also running the 
fridge. The manual that came with my bus indicates that the fridge is 
designed to be used at the end of a weekend when the ice inside has 
melted. When I use mine I only do it for a long weekend. I always make 
sure that everything inside is cold and/or frozen when I pack it, and I 
put a bunch of blue ice packs in the bottom of the fridge. On Sunday 
morning all the ice has melted, but things are still cool. I will turn 
on the fridge in the morning, and then run it while we are driving home.

I believe mine draws about 5 amps, but I may be remembering wrong.
