Subject: Need HOUSTON area help!

A forward from Ian who is trying to get help through the Type2 &quot;AIRS&quot; deal. 
He's not broke down on the side of the road, but any help generates the 
kharma, you know! I can't help him as I've downloaded to move (never had 
2-liter stuff, anyway) and am moving over the next 3 days. Any help out 
there? Message follows:

Pardon me for bugging you; I mooched your name off the AIRS
list
on type2_dot_com, and I'm in Houston. I'm in the middle of
rebuilding my first
engine, a 2-liter, and I discovered the pistons I have are from
two
different motors, and are two different weights (~460 g and ~480
g).
Shaving 20 g off a piston is way too much, in my opinion. Do you
have a
spare pair of set you'd be willing to swap or trade? I need to
get this
motor built by the end of this weekend, or else I'm in trouble.

        If not, any info you could set me up with would be great.

        Thanks,

        Ian Quigley
