Hey Kevin  Always tell us what year and size motor ,etc.  There  is also a
flywheel o ring that should be replaced at this time . You can do  without the
installing tool if you are good and careful. be sure to seat the  crank seal
all the way into place in the case.  torque the bolts and use  some locktite
on
them.  later  Mark Dearing
