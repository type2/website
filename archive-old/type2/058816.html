Subject: Preparing for New Web Site
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

http://www.busdepot_dot_com may be intermittantly down, or have strange or
incomplete contents, during this weekend, as we are preparing a changeover
to the new website.

The first version of the new site should be up sometime on Monday.  This
will have about 4000 of the most popular bus/vanagon items categorized by
part type and vehicle application (and fully searchable), with another 6000
or so (including the entire Bosch catalog) accessable only via a part number
search (you would have to know the part number).  A shopping cart and secure
order form will be added later next week.  In November, another 5000 or so
items will be added, and the site will be &quot;dressed up&quot; with pretty graphics,
jpgs of some of the parts, etc.  In the meantime, the graphics will be very
rudimentary but functional for the purposes of finding and ordering what you
want (the emphasis being on informational, not pretty).  In time I'll
&quot;glossy it up&quot; but right off the bat it will have far more useful info than
any other parts site on the net.

I'll let you know as soon as you can point your brower to the new site!
There will be a number of specials that I've been stockpiling to celebrate
the introduction of the new site, which will be on the Bargains page, and/or
on the List Members page if that page is up again right away.  In the event
that the Vanagon list is down for maintenance when I announce the new site,
try it Monday evening if you're curious.
