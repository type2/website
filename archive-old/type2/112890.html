Subject: the saga continues

My 79 auto westy that I paid $500 for is now at the body shop.  Engine
that I rebuilt is running great.  I thought I was going to get a
glorified paint job but went out there to see it and all the doors and
windows are removed and it was heading to get sandblasted this week.  I
think this thing is going to turn out nice.  The interior of Puff is
near pristine, just the exterior was fugly and the engine was in ruins. 
Another bus is getting resurrected and I'm excited about it.  Just
wanted to share...Greg
