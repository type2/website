Subject: Re: [T2] Syn oil to regular oil- Dangerous?

&gt; 	I'm looking at a vanagon that all it's life has had a diet of Mobil 1 
&gt; Synthetic oil. Being on the  verge of owning this van, and seeing how 
&gt; EXPENSIVE synthetic motor oils are, I'm wondering if it really is necessary 
&gt; to continue using the synthetic stuff. The van already has 130K on it and 
&gt; I'm looking for another 75K or so from it (without a rebuild (yes, it is 

then you will give yourself mucho insurance with the small premium of
Synthetic 

I got 214k on mine (if I recall) and the guy doing the rebuild said the
synthetic I put in it was what kept it moving the last few k.  

&gt; totally possible)). Does anyone out there have any experience with switching?

never even thought of switching

&gt; I guess I've just never been convinced of the advantages of the synthetic 
&gt; stuff; at least not convinced enough to go from about a buck a quart to 
&gt; almost 4 bucks a quart.

when it was rebuilt I was warned to use regular oil the first 3,000
miles...told me that the synthetic was too slick to hone in the new parts.  

&gt; My &quot;head smarts&quot; are telling me to just bite the bullet and keep going with 
&gt; the synthetic, but my wife (and our one income and two children) are making 
&gt; me look into the possibility of doing it cheaper.

penny wise, pound foolish

&gt; I always get ADVICE when I post to the lists, but what I really want is 
&gt; actual, real world, experiences. Of course, all responses, experience or 
&gt; otherwise, will be greatly appreciated.

and you will get advice up the ying yang I'm sure.  unfortunately (or
rather fortuneatly) I can't give you the advice you want to hear, I
wouldn't even consider using dinosaur remains in my engine.....

I haven't used anything but synthetic in any vehicle I have owned since
Mobil ONE was introduced.  1975 I think

303k on my 78 and still going, and a lot more k I hope

Bob


&gt; Thanks,
