On occasion I've had to turn my steering wheel a tad while turning the key
to get the engine to kick over.  This weekend - 200 miles from home, of
course, it decides that it doesn't want to play any of those Reindeer games
and won't start at all - full power to everything electric - just no go.  I
ended up wiggling the key in some pretty odd patterns until it would engage.

I have proper voltage at both ends of the bus - am I looking at a short of
some kind in the key-switch it self?

Bob Wallace has a good article in the archives on how to tear it down - just
wanting to know if this registers with any bussers in audience today that
have already gone through this and done the procedure - any words of wisdom
to diag this.

Thanks
