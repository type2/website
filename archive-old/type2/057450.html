    Well, there you are -- see, that's the problem. Extractors and
Webers aren't bad in the slightest -- VW themselves would use them if
they could, but for one, they're just too expensive, and for another,
they've got to deal with emissions. My attitude toward emissions is we
need to outlaw any engine over 2 liters for personal transportation. And
outlaw cars period inside city limits. But then I'm a radical
EarthFirster. Anyway, extractors are great, but manufacturers go the
cheap route. 
 
 
&gt; REALLY hot.  I know I killed that poor engine driving it around without
&gt; that seal.  You say yours never got hot.  I disagree.  You just didn't
&gt; notice how hot it got.

   Kinda' hard to not notice the cylinder head temp gauge. Always stayed
around 350-400, with an occasional foray around 450. I also noticed when
it started running around 550 a few months ago, but I guess I just had
too much crap on my mind at that point to figure out what was going on.
And there you are again -- duality, perhaps the most grievous problem we
all have, the constant internal dialogue we carry on with ourselves,
dragging the dead body of our past, or needlessly anticipating the
future, and thus not paying attention to the moment at hand. Until we
trip on the obvious and fall on our asses -- or faces (and there's
probably not much difference). Sigh!
