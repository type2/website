Subject: Wisconsin to Florida

Howdy all:
I'm a long-time list member who seldom posts 'cause I ain't got much to say,
'cause my bus resides in storage in Madison, Wisconsin, 1,200 miles north of
my home in sunny Florida. Not for much longer though.

This Friday I'm flying up north, spending some time with friends and
relatives, then cruising (slowly) back in the '70 Westy. It's been a long
wait -- about 16 months until I finally had some vacation accrued to go
rescue my baby. At $60 a month storage, it's been an expensive wait too.

But all that's over and I'm excited as hell. I'll post a trip report.
Attention AIRS members in Wisconsin, Iowa, Illinois, Tennessee, Kentucky,
Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia and Florida: Be on the lookout for a
cream-colored Westy that looks nice from a distance but upon close
inspection seems to have some wavy sheetmetal. I've printed out the names
hoping the good karma contained in that thick stack will carry me right on
through, but just in case...

See you on the road
Bob W.
