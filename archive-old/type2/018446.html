&gt;My engine leaks with equal enthusiasm whether I run synthetic or dino oil.
&gt;Therefore, I run synthetic because it is superior oil.  If you are going to
&gt;invest money in your bus, synthetic oil should be at the top of your list.

My engine doesn't leak oil. I consider oil under my engine to be my own blood
and its my first priority to correct leaks. I use straight castrol HD30 in 
the summer and Castrol 10w40 
in the winter, and I think that synthetic oil a waste of money that could be 
better spent on 
gauges.... my .02 cents.
