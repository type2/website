Subject: Re: [T2] interior paint

i didn't know the interior paint was different from the exterior? how
odd.
although, as an artist, i understand what you mean about the millions of
variations of WHITE, lol.

chris

&gt; &lt;&lt; It's white, but white is just like every other color and can be 
&gt; had in very many variations.
