Subject: Installed a starter relay, 77 Westy!

Hey now

I'm hoping that this is some useful information to some folks out
there.  Last weekend, I installed a starter relay in Samiam (77 Westy)
to remedy the won't-start-when-hot problem I encountered on my
trip to Canada the previous weekend.

 To paraphrase Muir and Hoover:

Essentially, your bus' starter depends on the solenoid to operate.
In addition to engaging the starter so that it turns the engine,
the solenoid also makes a contact so that the starter gets full
juice from the battery from a big thick wire.  The solenoid, however,
takes some juice itself to do its thing, and runs from a thin wire
that runs from the battery to the ignition and back to the solenoid.
After years, the resistance in that wire gets kind of high and the
solenoid can't get enough juice to do the job.

Muir recommends using a Ford bypass solenoid, which may take nearly
as much juice as the VW solenoid.  So...

 Here's what I did, many thanks to Sean Bartnik for the inspiration
 and instructions!

I bought a starter relay at the FLAPS, a KEM, replacement part for
an early/mid-eighties Chrysler.  These things are great, relative
to, say, an accessory relay, since they're rated high enough to handle
your VW starter without a problem, and (most importantly to me), the
places where the wires connect are labelled!  (Battery, Ignition,
Solenoid, and Ground).

So using 10-gauge wire all around, I connected:

 - the hot lead on the solenoid (direct from the battery) to the
   Battery connection on the relay

 - the ignition lead to the Ignition connection on the relay (used
   to be on the solenoid)

 - the Solenoid connection on the relay to the Ignition connection
   on the solenoid

 - the Ground connection on the relay to the starter mounting bolt

Samiam started right up (his solenoid had stuck last week, and he
wouldn't start with the stock setup...)!

Went to Woodstock yesterday for the Woodstock VW Reunion 3, and when
I got there after a 2-hour trip, Samiam started right up!  No more
sticking solenoid!

        TTFN
