Hi Volks,
   My wife Kathy and I have been driving buses for over 20 years now, and 
lately we've noticed something happening.  It used to be that people thought 
our choice of car was a little odd,  especially once the bus was no longer 
available new, here in the USA.  To most people they were just old, outdated 
vehicles.
   Well in just the last few months we've had a lot of people take notice of 
out present bus in a positive way.  We've had a stranger step off the curb 
while we were stopped at a traffic light and ask to buy our bus.  We've also 
had people pull up next to us on the highway, while doing 50-60 miles per 
hour, and ask if we wanted to sell our bus.  The best of all is when  teens 
and kids shout stuff at us as we go by.  Usually it's something like &quot;cool 
car&quot; or &quot;hey I like your van&quot; and one time it was &quot;radical ride man&quot;.  The 
funniest was when a comment came from a girl who was riding in the back of 
her mom's luxury SUV.
   What's going on here?  Our bus isn't that nice that it should draw all 
this attention.  It's a 71 westy that still needs a good bit of work  It 
looks OK, but not great.  Is this happening to anyone else, or have we just 
been lucky?   Maybe the next time someone asks to buy it I should ask how 
much they are willing to pay!
   Have a great weekend everybody, and enjoy the good weather while we still 
have it.  Pretty soon we'll be scraping the insides of our windshields 
again.
