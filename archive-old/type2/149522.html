Subject: Steering Wheel Year?

Howdy,

I have a pretty nice steering wheel that I bought that I thought would fit 
my 71 Westy (at least that is what the seller told me - different guy than 
the one that sold me the bumper who also said it would fit).

Anyways it looks pretty close to my 71 but the hole in the middle for the 
splines is too small on this wheel.

Also its a little flater on the tops of the wheel (the 2 spokes I'll call 
them).
And its grooved underneath those spokes).

I want to put it up for sale but want to be sure the new buyer isn't as 
dissapointed as me and find out it is the wrong wheel.

The part number is 211 415 655 and it looks like there might be a B after 
it.

If somebody could tell me what year(s) van this might fit I would appreciate 
it.

Thanks
Kevin
