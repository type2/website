Subject: Re: [T2] Converting Poptop into Non-Poptop

Hi Hal,

I have converted a non-poptop bus into a pop-top. You're going the 
other way.

The 71 body used by westfalia is a sunroof bus. But to convert this to 
an operational sunroof would require a sunroof, cabling, drains, and 
the sunroof drive mechanism. These parts will probably be difficult to 
acquire and install..

A sunroof will easily fill the hole. The main problem is that the VW 
sunroof is not water-tight, it has drain tubes through the body to 
remove rainwater/snow-melt, etc from the ledge the roof rides in. Your 
westy probably does not have these tubes installed, which means your 
sunroof will leak.

You could take a section of the roof from a donor bus and weld it over 
the hole, but it would be expensive to do it properly. And you'd need a 
new headliner too.

What's wrong with the pop-top?

Happy trails,

Greg Potts

&gt;
&gt; Or if there is someone in the Seattle area who has a standard bus that 
&gt; they'd
&gt; like to trade for a westy, I'd be open to discussion.  This is not the
