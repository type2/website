&lt;&lt; They're Daewoo's and all the printing on the tires is in Chinese. They
were $35 each (!) and the last 2 they had. The guy wasn't sure if he
was going to get any more.



When I can afford it I'll get all 4 matching name brand tires. But
that worked for now, and they'll remain my spares. &gt;&gt;

Maybe, maybe not...Daewoo (the car) is gonna go under the
Chevy brand name in Europe...The Saab SUV is really a Suba-
ru...The new Pontiac GTO is an Australian Holden...Pep Boys
sells Cooper tires under their Futura brand...Who knows 
what your Daewoos might be named tomorrow... ?-(

Tony in NJ (Who firmly believes all sneakers are made in the
                 same Chinese factory and only the names have 
                 been changed to protect the retailers' bottom
                 line... ;-(
