Subject: Re: [T2] Riviera fridge questions

I had a 100 Ah in my '78 westy and it would last about
12 hours, before the aluminum would no cool anymore. 
The battery died (due to my ingorance) and I need a new
one.  FYI, I went to a battery shop and we went through
all the deep cycles until we found the largest that
fit, and yes it was a 100 Ah.

I much prefer my 72 with the ice box.  A standard block
of ice would last two days and you can recharge by
buying more ice!  What a concept!
