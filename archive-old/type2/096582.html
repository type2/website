&gt; &gt; Has anyone seen the new November issue of VW Trends Magazine?
&gt; &gt; On page 48 they have a spread on a 71 Westy from Tennessee.
&gt; &gt; WOW!  Nice to see a bay window bus in there once in a while.
&gt; 
&gt; The seat article was useful to me.  It appears TMI vends the sisel that goes
&gt; under the fabric and over the horsehair padding that I've been looking a
&gt; long time for. 28&quot;x6' roll. It softens the seat a bit and keeps the
&gt; horsehairs from poking through as the seat ages.
&gt; 
&gt; When I redid my seats I was unable to find this stuff anywhere in town so I
&gt; reused what I had even though it wasn't in the best of shape.
