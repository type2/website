Subject: Is this a Champagne Edition?
Message-ID: &lt;37902D2C.BE2D5BE0_at_home_dot_com&gt;

My best friend bought this bus at an auction about a year ago, it has
never ran since acquired. It is chocolate brown with a brown dash and
corduroy seats, it has the clock in it and the door panels are differnet
than normal too. Is this the Champagne Edition? What are these worth? Do
they have any rarity to them? I think it's a '78. I can get this bus for
free and am debating is it worth it....See a picture at:
