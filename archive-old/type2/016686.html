&gt; I'm trying to pull the engine on my '78 2.0 FI and the engine just won't
&gt; separate from the tranny.  The right-front engine bolt has to be the
&gt; culprit.  I removed a 15mm bolt from just above the starter mounts - I
&gt; thought from the Bentley pictures that this is the one, but Muir says
&gt; that if it's not 17mm, it's the wrong one.  I've seen some messages in
&gt; the archives that imply that I actually want to remove the upper mounting
&gt; bolt for the starter, but this bolt isn't hex, it's round with one flat
&gt; side.  I pulled the engine three years ago without any complications, I
&gt; just don't remember what I did differently :(.  Anyone have an idea what
&gt; my problem is - I'm about ready to put the bolts back in and drop the
&gt; tranny with it so I can see what I'm doing, but I'm somewhat limited by
&gt; help and jack resources.

Chris:
Two things, reverse order:
1. Your last statement that you're about to put the bolts back in and
pull the trans with the engine has me a little concerned.
It's been a few years, but it seems like I would always get the rear
trans mount bolts out,lower the engine and trans as a  unit and after
it's down a few inches you have a bit more room to remove both upper
nuts, the left one ahead of the engine tin, the right one ahead and
lurking lower than the throttle body.
2. Yes the upper starter bolt and the right upper trans-engine bolt are
one and the same! Use a ratcheting 17mm box wrench to remove the NUT
from said bolt.(see above for location)
