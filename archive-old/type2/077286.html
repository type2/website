&gt; Well I sorted the battery issue... but my Bus never ceases to 
&gt; amaze be. I decided to fill the container with fresh cleaning fluid  
&gt; (actually it's the first time I did that) - ok, fine 'till then. After that 
&gt; I 
&gt; went for a drive and pulled on a service station to pressurize the 
&gt; container. I read somewhere that it should be pressurized to a 
&gt; maximum of 42 PSI - so I choose to fill it at 35 PSI. A friend 
&gt; reached for the air pump hose and I plugged it in. For some 
&gt; seconds nothing seemed to happen, then I heard a &quot;swiissh&quot; like 
&gt; sound and I saw that I was loosing air through the bus hose, a little 
&gt; while after I felt my pants wet - I looked and saw that cleaning fluid 
&gt; was pouring from under the steering wheel.  I screw the cap and  
&gt; tested the washer and it had very little pressure on.
&gt; What exactly went wrong? Thanks in advance!

&gt; The mist valve is bad. You can no longer get just the valve so you will 
&gt; have to replace the entire wiper switch. I did mine a few weeks ago. It is
