VW bus?? How did it do on the mountains?? Did you have to shift to 2nd?? 

The late Rabbit based box is tough and reliable.  You will need 2nd on
grades.  It isn't as bad as it sounds as the autobox 2nd and final combine
somewhere between a stick 2 and 3 but closer to 3rd, and the autobox
drive and final come right out to a bit lower than the 4th and 4.57 late
final.  1 is a bit high, but you don't know it because of the torque
multiplication, it will &quot;launch&quot; (if I dare use the term) about as well
as a stick.  It ends up that I would hold an auto to about 45-47 mph
pulling a good grade whereas I'd hold a stick to 50-52 on the same grade.
I'm one to let a bus rev though.  They do a little worse on mileage, but
pretty trivial if the thing is in good shape.  You should or should not
do normal service before the trip depending on your view of old automatics.
Some feel changing ATF that has been there 50000+ unknown miles
will dislodge so much crap bad things will happen.  Other feel, change
it.  If you go with that, I'd change it and the screen, then change it again
in about 250 miles or so before you go.  But I'm not saying personally
that I would do it, as the last time I changed an unknown vanagon's
ATF after putting about 15000 miles on it, it croaked within 3000 miles.
But it had 120k on it and might well have been going anyway (still the
old was not really burnt or brown.)

Oh the early T3/T4 based box is probably just as reliable in theory but is
much older in practice, and harder to find parts for.  Plus you can't swap
in a rabbit box which I'm pretty sure can be done in a Bus same as in
a Vanagon for the later box, though I've never personally done a bus, just
carefully inspected one.

A few thoughts.
