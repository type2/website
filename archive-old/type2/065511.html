&gt;&gt;To further perpetuate this trivial thread, I would suggest:  Does anyone
&gt;&gt;have the statistics on hand for early vanagons ('80, '81, etc.)?  If they
&gt;&gt;are the same as for the '79, that would further the theory that the '79
&gt;&gt;figures are for the vanagon and not the baywindow.

&gt;Know what we need? Interior volume, in cubic meters or cubic zirconia or
&gt;however you measure volume in German. That would settle the
&gt;bumper/mirror/fender/arbitrary federal measuring whim controversy.

Maybe Bob could get some more of those cans of expanding foam insulation
and report back how many it takes to fill up a split, baywindow and vanagon?
The units would then just be &quot;cans&quot; and eliminate the need for conversion
factors.  :-) :-)
