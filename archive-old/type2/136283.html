&gt; Months back someone posted some shots of their torsion bar installation.  I
&gt; have poured through the archive and the library but must have put in the
&gt; incorrect search criteria because I could not find a single link reference
&gt; so that I could have a pictoral example.  I know its around somewhere
&gt; because I followed the link from this list and looked at it when it was
&gt; originally posted.
