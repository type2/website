&gt; when I noticed
&gt; the inlet valve - it had receded, and was sitting with
&gt; its face flush with the surface of the head.  I looked
&gt; in the back of the inlet port, and could see a &quot;roll&quot;
&gt; of metal that had been hammered out in a ring behind
&gt; the valve seat. I took the valve out, and the seat was
&gt; loose in the head. 
&gt; 
&gt; 

hey guys   This is a sign of the head overheating and the cooler air coming 
in the intake causing the seat to shrink and the head to expand.  My guess is 
he doesnt have a CHT sensor.   Running high grade gas will also help with this 
problem but the main thing is to keep the clylinder temps down  .   Of all the 
heads I have seen it is usually the intake seat that comes loose close to 90% 
.  later and have fun  Mark Dearing
