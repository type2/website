Subject: RE: [T2] Correct tire size for westy

I just got a pair of Cooper Wildcat 185/75/14's for my '78 Bus. A friend,
who owns a '78 Westy, recommended them as a comparable performer (not
strictly comparable) as the Bridgestone 603V's I had mentioned to him. I
haven't had them long enough to comment on performance, especially since
they were replacing the studded snows that came with the vehicle. Any
comments on the Cooper tire, and secondly, what is the aspect ration a
measure of: Height/Tire Width?

Thanks
Mat
