Subject: RE:  Free Jalousie Windows

I want to thank those who think I should keep them installed.  I very rarely
ever opened them.  My Bus stays &quot;relatively&quot; cool while driving with the
drivers window open and the fresh air flaps open.  I do have a new A/C to
install when all the window work and headliner is done.  I also have a set
of Vent Shades installed on my front doors, so I can leave the windows
cracked to keep the temperature down.

The Jalousie windows flex in their space, causing the seal to allow moisture
to get under it.  I know, I probably should have sealed the seal with
something.  It did last quite a number of years before I decided to do
something about it.  Also, the window screens rattle a little.  I don't like
my Bus making strange noises.

My replacement windows will be the full, solid middle window without the
Vent Wing.  I have only found one original German Window and I am having a
glass company cut me another.
