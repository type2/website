John,

It depends on what you mean...

If you mean buying a set of trailing arms from bus boys and flopping them
on... you can do this!  Heck, even *I* can do this :-)  It'll take you a
day.  No sweat. Jump on it!  Look in the library for the front axle beam
replacement page, this is part of that procedure.

If you mean buying the ball joints, pulling the arms, pressing the old
ball joints out and the new joints in... nope, I would not.  For two
reasons.  First, the bus boys price is very little higher than the price
of ball joints alone.  Second, not only do you need a fairly mongo sized
press, you need some pretty specialized plates.  There is just not a lot
of extra room around the ball joints on those trailing arms!
