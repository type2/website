David,

the interesting thing is that without the spring (I believe is the one
between the distributor shaft and case, if my english is right) the
upward movement is still there.

Regards.

When

&gt;the distributor mounting screws as best as possible. There were a
slight

driving

&gt;Is this normal? What are your experiences with this?

There is a spring that pushes up on the distributor - it's normal.  I
put
an extra spacer under my distributor drive gear (two total, to bring it
in
line with Wilson's rebuild specs) which made it spring up even more
(maybe
3mm) but it hasn't hurt anything after 50,000+ miles.
