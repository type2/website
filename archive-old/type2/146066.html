Subject: Re: [T2] Crane XR700 ignition

Hey guys    I have used them on all kinds of dizzys  and am sold on them   I 
have one on my 67 bug that has been on there for 15 years  with out any 
problems   I have seen these being sold at Advance Auto stores now for about $110.   
mfg# 700-0226    I have only seen one go bad in the last 15 years and that 
was caused by a shorting tach . I have seen some that the rotor button needed to 
be shortened  to fit correctly   later  Mark Dearing
