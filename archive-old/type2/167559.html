Subject: Re: [T2] Re: I AM GOING TO wimper.!!!!!!! or cry

had a chance to sit and think, and I am beginning to seriously suspect
that I had two seperate issues, the dropped seat did not have anything to
do with the way it was running and the way it was running got me looking
and finding the dropped seat. was running on 3 maybe 2 cyl for a time, ??
how long.

so I have fixed to valve issue but not the initial problem.


so let me go back to the drive back from everybus.

morning I leave, engine is very hard to start, but once running was
running fine. and did not shut it off.

.  first hundred miles or so I notice a slight loss of power, sort of like
going up a  shallow grade not a big deal, didn't even really notice it at
first.

.  second hundred miles slowly lose top speed and  later some power, it
just wouldn't go that fast and took forever to get up to speed, but once
going it could keep up decent speed, at first near the end it was maybe
topped out at 50mph

.  North of Richmond it was getting really bad. got off the interstate in
Doswell about 40 miles North of Richmond, was getting worse and worse
here.  75 miles from Richmond I was lucky to get her up to 40mph (now this
whole time it is raining so I have lights and wipers on, nothing else)

.  By the Maryland state line I got a running start at the steep Harry
Nice bridge over the Potomac river and just barely got over the
top..._dot_coming off the bridge the engine stalls and I drift into the
welcome center.  will not restart at first, finally get it started and
into the parking area.

call AAA.   when I get it home I can sort of get it to run, about like
now. no power but running real rough.

???? so whats up.

. had crane ignition so took that out and put in points


?? are there any circuits in the front of the bus that has an effect on
the bus running??

?? have twin batteries so lots of juice.

?? had problems with the wiring at first when I put it back together, (the
first time)

?? when it idles it is smooth, but no power

?? if there is a component that can be changed, I've done it

?? went thru the VW FI trouble shooting book step by step and the bottom
line was it said the brain was bad??  replaced but didn't seem to help

I am totally stumped

thanks
Bob
