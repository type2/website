Subject: Re: [T2] saggy back end



&gt; When I asked my local shop to adjust the torsion bars to level my 71 
Westy,
&gt; he was reluctant to do so, afraid of breaking the torsion bars.  

I'd suspect more that he didn't want to do the job.

&gt;Instead, he
&gt; installed KYB coil spring over shocks.  I remember some flaming and 
general
&gt; disdain for this treatment of the problem, but I've had them for 
about 15
&gt; years now and no problems ever.  The handling of the bus was markedly
&gt; improved, due to the higher overall spring rate in the rear, which 
lessened
&gt; the body roll during cornering.

Well, the shock points aren't made to carry spring loads, but your 
obviously have survived well.
