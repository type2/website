&gt;Whats a 1700cc longblock go for?

Can't address cost. Value, however, I would evaluate thus:

Compression test shows 130+ and all cylinders within 5 psi, leakdown not 
more than 5% all cylinders, crankshaft endplay in spec. Valve guide wear 
checks in spec. Documented history from last rebuild is thorough and 
complete. That longblock is worth $1000.

Non-spec compression or 7%+ leakdown or excess crankshaft endplay or other 
problems and no documentation = core value at best = $200 max.

This is my subjective opinion based upon objective testing. Without 
testing/documents I wouldn't pay more than $50 no matter what the owner 
said about it unless I was willing to risk a good deal of time/money.
