Subject: RE: [T2] HOSED by a transport company!

I bought a bus in san diego.Flew out and drove it back to missouri.Maybe not
the smartest thing to do,but it was a great time.My brother made me call him
everyday to let him know how far away I was so he knew how far he would have
to drive to rescue me if something broke.It was a camper so I didnt have to
worry about hotel bills.I drove about 12 hours a day,found a nice place to
camp and then started driving again when I woke up.Stopped in phoenix and
met Richard Kimbrough and bought one of his bus tow bars.Stopped in
Albaqurque and met J. P. Henriksen.Got to know my bus real good and started
learning its quirks.I knew nothing about fuel injection but had driven
carbed bugs for years so I was hoping I would only have minor problems.Only
had one.Died and wouldnt fire back up in a torrential rain in kansas.Started
back up seconds after I decided to call AAA roadside assistance.Got water in
the dizzy cap  I guess.Anyway It might not have been the smartest thing to
do,but I had a hell of a good time...
