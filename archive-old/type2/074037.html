Subject: Slid state?


Excuse me... did you say solid state fuel pump?  How does that 
work?  Doesn't solid state imply no moving parts?

-David



Got that out of the JCWhitney Catalogue.
&quot;Master solid state pumps for installation with fuel return lines&quot; $49.98
This has been near the end of their catalogues for years.
They make the same claim for their smaller model also
