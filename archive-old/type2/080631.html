Subject: Re: [T2] Clutch slowly going- WHY?

your clutch cable may have broken a few strands and/or is just
stretching, but i don't know how you can check w/o taking it out.

&gt; like it's only the cable that needs replacing. It DOES NOT slip when 
&gt; in gear, it's just hard to get it into gear and it feels like I need 
&gt; to push the pedal farther than it can go to get the clutch to 
&gt; disengage. Any thoughts?
