Subject: Painting in Cold Weather

Greetings Volks,

I've been getting a fair amount of bus work done since Christmas, but 
I've come to an interesting intersection.

I'm at the point where I'm ready to hit the underbelly of my bus with a 
wire wheel, a metal etcher, some primer, and a coat of rattle-can.  
It's a lot of work, but I think I'm ready for it.  Which brings me to 
an interesting point:

most of these paints say they should not be used when it's under 50 
degrees F.

Well, I'm not sure about you folks out west, but out here in Washington 
DC we've got highs in the teens and I'm lucky to see 31 F in the garage 
(go go gadget insulated Dickies' Overalls!).

Therefore, my question is this:

Can I paint in 30 deg weather and just leave it longer to &quot;dry&quot;?
What if I apply it when it's 30 degrees, but immediately place a 
radiant heater under it for an hour or two?

Any thoughts would be appreciated.

Similarly, thoughts on other ways to get all the rust off all the nooks 
and crannies under my bus without going through the considerable effort 
of grinding it down would be appreciated.  I might be willing to have 
someone sandblast it or steam-clean it (I can check locally) but I'm 
concerned about how well this will work without me removing stuff like 
the tranny and various brake lines, etc.

Thanks,
     Tom
