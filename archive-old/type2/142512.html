What were the compression results after you installed and ran it?

&gt;1. I found my EGR filter was missing and the feed from the CC had been
&gt;blocked off some time ago, judging from the rust on the welded-on cap.
&gt;Decided to eliminate the whole system, so we blocked off the opening on
&gt;the throttle body and removed the pipe and EGR valve.  Is it fine to
&gt;just eliminate that line from the vacuum system? (DVDA dizzy)

Yes.

&gt;2. Found three wires near the battery that have female blade-type
&gt;connectors: solid brown; brown/white; and solid yellow, all together in
&gt;a harness running next to the battery tray.  Neither of us remembered
&gt;disconnecting these from anything.  As far as I can tell from the
&gt;archives, those serve some test/diagnostic purpose and do not need to be
&gt;hooked up to anything.  Is this correct?  If not, where do they go and
&gt;what purpose(s) do they serve?

The wiring diagram shows them going to the battery and other test points. Look at all the number orange circles:

&gt;3. What is the best location for the CHT sensor (temp sensor II)?  For
&gt;some reason, my new engine did not have anywhere to mount this.  Don't
&gt;ask how I rigged it to run in order to drive home.  AVP is going to
&gt;reimburse me for having a hole drilled and tapped for the sensor.

What engine number of theirs did you order? I would have figured all 2L FI engines would have a head with the hole tapped there.

Which begs the question: what is the part number on that head?

&gt;My
&gt;old engine had the sensor in front (front is Front) of the #3 intake -
&gt;the engine tin had actually been cut and peeled back to allow for this.
&gt;It looks like there is  a hole in the tin where the sensor should be -
&gt;between #3 and #4.  Is that where it should go?

Yes.
