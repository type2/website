&gt; When you say &quot;....not had one hit 70 lbs, ever&quot; what weight oil are you
&gt; using?? I will regularly see 80 PSI (max for my gauge) when I first start up
&gt; my motor this ALWAS goes down after about 5 minutes to me this makes sense
&gt; for a COLD motor with COLD THICK oil....
&gt;
&gt; Am I wrong??? Should my oil pressure be less than 70 PSI even when I'm using
&gt; 20W50 on a 65 degree F. morning?????

mine routinely hits 70psi (but never above) many times while at speed if
it is cool out side.   and I use 15-50synthetic oil  I'm not worried so
much what the presure is but rather trends, or 0 presure

(of course the guage could be flaky too, standard off the shelf VDO)
