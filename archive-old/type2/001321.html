Subject: Rear door screen?
Date: Tue, 24 Apr 2001 15:21:17 -0500

I just received a back screen-net for the rear door on my 1977 Riviera, I
now need to install snaps but looking at it I realize it's not as obvious as
I thought where they go? Do they go on the outside of the bus or the inside?
Can you close the door when on or not? Does anyone have a picture or
diagram, I hate to start drilling holes to install snaps till I'm sure where
to put them. Are they really mosquito proof, do people use them?

Ray
