Hello.
I had an electrical fire once in my '71 under the key/turn signal area. Good
fun. Ran back and pulled the battery ground cable where it hooked to the
body. Took the car apart and fixed the short, had to put new wire in. 

It could have been worse, we were moving and besides the whole family we had
our stuff in the bus. (Stuff is always importaint when you are moving). 

When you get smoke from electrical things, that means something went wrong. 
The smoke is escaping from the wires.
Smoke is supposed to stay in the wires. 

Electrical fire = No bus.

I wish you real good luck.
Rob.
