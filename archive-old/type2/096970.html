Subject: Heat in the bus.

Well I managed to clear up the oil leak problem on Kermit.  Turns on
that he PO was not using the gaskets on the oil strainer so it was
leaking like a sieve.  New gaskets, no oil leak, imagine that.

 

However, while the bus was up on jack stands I did discover the cause of
the lack of heat.  The heater control boxes and tubes are not there.
Does anyone know of a good inexpensive replacements for these.  I picked
up a pair of good tubes at Oktobugfest this weekend but still need the
control boxes to hook them up to.  I really don't want to shell out for
new boxes until I'm ready to rebuild the engine, which based on the way
it runs, could be a good long while.  I've found the heat exchangers for
$180 each through J.C. Whitney (the previous exchangers are on their
last legs, and with the CV boots torn, who knows what has landed inside)
and the lowest I've seen new controllers is around $52 each. 

 

Thanks in advance,

 

Duke
