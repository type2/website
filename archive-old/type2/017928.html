Dear list,
            This one's got me stumped. Maybe you can help.
I'm driving my '78 2.0L  FI camper along the freeway for about five
minutes, it wasn't even up to operating temp. Suddenly it starts bucking
and losing power. I manage to get it to an off ramp and pull into an
AM/PM where I can't restart it. I go around the back to check things out
and the catalytic converter is glowing red! Not a minute later a
fire-truck pulls in saying someone had reported a car with flames coming
out the tail-pipe. Since nothing seemed to be currently burning I told
them it was OK and got the beast towed home.
    So I took apart the muffler assembly. The mesh part in the converter
towards the muffler was a twisted mass of melted metal, most of which
fell out when I shook it. There were further pieces in the muffler.
    So does anyone know why this would happen? The converter was only
about a month old. Is the muffler supposed to have a blockage in the
tube going through it? Mine has one that seems to belong there. Can I
hook up the converter again and have the bus still run albeit less
smogified? Do I need a new muffler? I really don't want a recurrence of
the experience and am wondering where the problem came from.

Thanks,
        Gordon
        '78 Westy
