Subject: sliding door hardware
Message-Id: &lt;4.1.19990630092302.009a8820_at_deepwell_dot_com&gt;

any suggestions, tricky procedures, or other to help me replace the door
hardware on my '68 campmobile?  there seems to be a broken plastic piece in
the slider track... it's still attached to the rear end of the wide &quot;U&quot;
shaped swingarm [part of it looks cracked off.

i don't know that it's the problem, but my sliding door does not slide
nearly as smoothly as the '69 at the wreck yard. should i pull that whole
door and bring it home? just get the hardware out of it?  can i buy the
plastic piece for $0.49 at the local vw shop?

i usually just go pull more than i need at the yard [to see what's there,
and how to take it off] then bring it home and do it again with some
experience... 

thanks for any help -

btw: things are going along fine on my bus rebuild.  got the longblock - a
bit more expensive than i figured, but mine now none the less.  painting
things as i touch them... engine tin, gas filler hole/pipe, gas tank,
engine compartment... eye sockets, nose, bumper, and vent intake 
CV joints are some *greasy* mothers, boy.
going to pull the transmission for good measure - as well as all the rest
of the rear suspension and clean it all - every painted part has been checked.
