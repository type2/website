I am a communications hardware design engineer for a contract
enginnering firm in Boulder, CO.  My other mode of transportation has
two wheels and is powered by yours truly.  Have a great weekend!

I replaced the front shift rod grommet on my '78 bus this yesterday.  No
more rattles and tight shifting.  Ain't life grand!  Happy bussin'
