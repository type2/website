Subject: Re: [T2] Stud removal

I wish you luck....

The exhaust studs are for numerous reasons, a real pain to get when broken
in the area you stated..

The head studs are sometimes locked into place so good that they must be
milled out, inserted, and replaced.

Subject: [T2] Stud removal


&gt; OK, just got a &quot;new&quot; head for the Monkbus, but the
&gt; exhaust studs are broken. I need to get them out. The
&gt; studs are broken 3/4 of the way up and I can only get
&gt; one nut on there, so the double nut method won't work.
&gt; (It worked so well on the ones that I removed from the
&gt; old head.) I have them soaking in penetrating oil right
&gt; now. I have tried vise grips to no avail.
&gt;
&gt; Any suggestions as to removing them? Heat? I checked the
&gt; archives, but didn't find anything, believe it or not.
&gt; (Maybe I still need to perfect my search technique.)
&gt;
&gt; TIA
