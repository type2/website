Subject: Do I drop both Tranny and Engine together?

Hi,

I am going to drop my engine for the first time and I have been told to take
out the transmission and engine together.  The reason was that it is too
difficult to put them back in separately.

So, what if I drop them separately, then reconnect them when they are out and
then put them back in as a unit?

thanks,
