Subject: Hall Ignition Cutting Out '80

Hi all -
If you remember a recent thread I started concerning how to test 
coils, a new wrinkle has thrust itself upon me.  After spending $70 
for a new coil, 4 weeks later I am having the same symptoms.  The 
ignition systen sometimes works and sometimes doesn't.  
When it doesn't, I get no spark from the coil.  
When it does work, everything seems OK.

I went back to the Benltey and ran the diagnostics and test on the 
coil resistance (OK), checked the Hall Control Unit (OK) and the Hall 
Generator (OK).  Still the problem exists.

Buried in there in Bentley is a little statement (love this kind) 
that says, &quot;If everything checks out OK, replace the Hall Control 
Unit&quot;.  Great, even the experts can't tell if it's working by testing 
it, just replace it. I did just that, and it works.  

But did I really SOLVE the problem and PREVENT the cutting out 
from happening again?  Anyone have experience or knowledge on 
the Hall stuff and can answer this?

Separate post coming on BUYING a Hall Control Unit, whole 'nother 
subject.
