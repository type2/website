Subject: [T2] Re:  [VB] VW based military vehicle

The owners of this vehicle would like to have the tranny repaired, I guess
it leaks.  Who could I send them to that could repair this tranny?  I
thought it might be a barn door tranny, but Thom things it may be a Kubel
or an early Porsche.  Either could be correct, Fletcher was friends with
Dr. Porsche and had a couple of Kubels when he was developing this car.
= = = = = = = =  =

believe barndoor tranny is the same as kubel.   well through bus VIN  20- 46 
xxx or so.   when they made buses they just tossed a kubel tranny in it ( so 
bd axle tubes/rgboxes are the same as kubel,  Not the same as post barndoor)  
in early 53 they came out with the partially synchronised trans,  the kubel 
is crash box  (no synchros) like the early barndoor.    Dunno about Porsche 
trannys
