Subject: Re: tires

George,

&gt;A winner if you want to drive around on undersized, undercapacity tires.

Under-capacity - yes.
Under-size? 195/75R14 is roughly the same diameter as 185R14 (An 80%
profile is implied in these tire sizes, although it is not explicitly
stated- like 185/80R14):

Tire radius profile = size * profile.

195 * 75% = 146.25
185 * 80% = 148
(This gives distance in mm from rim to tread. To get full diameter,
double this and add 14 inches. Then for circumfrance mult by pi -
3.14159)
(1% difference).
