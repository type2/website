Banks junk yard, on route 1, 1 mile north of Conowingo Maryland -

has a '78 bus with a sliding sun roof.  I was able to crank it a foot both 
ways before I got bored.  Perhaps the cables might be good, if it works that 
much.

Be sure to talk with 'Lee', the fuzzy looking, older_than_middle_aged owner. 
  Offer him a reasonale price for what ever you take off, and he has been 
kind in the past.

DON'T work with the slim hick West Virginia trucker guy.

BTW, the '78 has a full engine, but I did not look too closely at it.  Lee 
would take $300 for it, I am sure.  Stick, but had an airconditioner setup 
(compresser ripped off already).
