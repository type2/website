&gt;if your gonna do that much work, chase down a 2liter block and build

I agree with Bob and not with your local VW wonk.  But really, if your
compression is good, replacing your long block isn't going to fix the
problem!  You're gonna hate life after spending $1500 and the problem is
still there.

Remember that you need three basic things for your engine to run - spark,
compression, and fuel.  You already know that you have compression.  Test
for fuel by dripping some fuel in the right carb with a turkey baster or
straw while the engine is idling.  Do the cylinders suddenly start firing?
Then fuel is your problem.  Otherwise, it's spark.  See how easy that was?
:-)

I'm assuming you're talking about not pulling weight at idle.  If the right
head were not pulling it's weight under heavy throttle, you wouldn't be
able to get up to 60mph on level ground.  Since I don't hear you
complaining of no power on the freeway, I'll assume you are hitting on all
four when you're on the freeway and the problem is only at idle.  That
*really* points to a fuel problem since you have a separate idle circuit in
your carbs.  If you don't understand your central idling system, break out
the books and start reading.
