&gt; For $350 you can tune like the pros (although at this price point, HC and

I saw the ad for this product and was seriously thinking about getting
it in the spring when funds become available from thinning our camper
fleet. I was particularly attracted to its data capture and computer
download capability for continuous monitoring under driving
conditions. Also it's portability from vehicle to vehicle.

&gt; I was lucky enough to get the bung welded in for free. This section is
&gt; stainless steel, so we used a stainless bung and rod. I have no idea how
&gt; much a muffler shop would charge for this service.

I think charges for small jobs like this are minimal based on my
experience with muffler shops.
