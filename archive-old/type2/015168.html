&gt;Someone earlier in the thread suggested that maybe this could be handled
&gt;like insurance. I think that's a great idea, but I'm not sure you could
&gt;afford the policy and Lloyds may be the only company who would pick it up.

AAA of Colorado had &quot;trip interruption insurance&quot; a about 10 years ago that
was a policy paid in addition to you usual membership (for tows and maps).  It
lasted less than a year due to nearly instant insolvency--people got &quot;braver&quot;
taking trips in their old cars (I think you had to travel more than 250
miles to qualify) and the claims came flying in. AAA capped the pay out
at $500 per claim but the vast majority maxed this $$ out.  After a very
brief intial offering, no co-insurer wanted to play.  I suspect we might
run into the same sort of problems. . . Just MHO
