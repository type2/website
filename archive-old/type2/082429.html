Subject: engine stands

All this talk of jack stands brought to mind something
I've been pondering on and off for awhile.  Where's
the best deal on engine stands?=20

I've seen the bench mounted variety on the various
VW vendor sites, but I don't feel real comfortable
placing my 2.0 liter engine on one of those, even
if the stand holds up, I'm no carpenter and I don't
want to be reminded of that by finding my engine=20
smashed all over the floor in my shop.  Also, how
many people does it take to help get the engine
on-and-off the stand?  I'm lucky to scrounge 1 person
these days, my friends back out of the driveway and leave
if they see the bus backed into the shop.

It just seems to me that the roll-away stand would make things
a bit easier.
