Subject: Re: [T2] battery to choose?

Right now I'm running both a deep cycle and a cranking battery, wired in

parallel. I did have a relay to shut off the cranking battery when the
ignition was off, but the relay crapped out on me, so I've just got 'em
wired together.

I noticed at Advance the other day a battery that is both a cranking
battery and deep cycle marine battery all at the same time. Anyone tried

one of these yet?
I'd like to free up that space that the extra battery takes up (maybe
for a gas heater?), that's the reason I'm asking...
