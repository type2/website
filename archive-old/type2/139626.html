Don,

I might suggest that your starter has picked this particular time to go 
south....waaaaay south.

OR!  one of your battery cables/connections to the starter has decided
that it's time to give up the ghost.

If your battery will turn over the Volvo, then put the battery back in the 
bus and start tracing and checking the main primary wires....(with battery 
disconnected of course).

Hi speed clicking always means that either the battery is pretty dead, or 
the starter is not getting all the juice it needs, or the starter is 
toast....you pick one.


Pull all of them off of the starter and get serious with fine sandpaper.

Same with grounds.  You been around awhile, you know the drill....

Double check the big wires for broken strands, corroded terminals and 
connectors...etc.


Once that is done, then *make sure* bus is in neutral, crawl underneath
and short the starter to see if it turns the engine...leave everything 
else just like it was before and work from there.

The object is to make the starter work consistently and reliably whether 
anything else is hooked up or not.

Cheers, dave

&gt; Took the battery back to wallyworld this morning. They put it on the

&gt; 
&gt; Got back, decided to try something new. I popped every fuse out of the
&gt; holder. Put the battery in, disconnected the coil, cranked the
&gt; starter. It turned!!! WooHoo!!!
&gt; 
&gt; Ran a jumper from the battery to the + side of the coil, tried again.
&gt; Highspeed clicking then nothing. Went back and disconnected
&gt; everything, still nothing. Not even clicking. Battery is still fine.
&gt; It started the Volvo no prob.
&gt; 
&gt; Started checking everything connected to the coil... The wire to the
&gt; carbs for the chokes and plungers is showing ground. I disconnected
&gt; each item from the wire and still got ground. (I disconnected each
&gt; item one at a time... I may try pulling them all at once and see, or
&gt; testing them individually with no wire.)
&gt; 
&gt; Re-injured my shoulder so I'm done for now. :(
