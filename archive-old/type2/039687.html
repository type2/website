Subject: door handle

Nikki and list-
Sorry, I should have been more specific.  I was talking about the inside 
sliding door handle.  but not the one in the front of the door. the rear one 
on the inside sliding door.  the early busses don't have that like the newer 
ones do.  its the &quot;silent closing handle&quot; you refer too.
picures?

I just went through this on The List! Since you have a 71 and the spice
cabinet is in the way of the inside sliding door handle when you close
the door from the inside (68-74), you're looking for a double-ended
handle for that. Some kind person -- I forget who but hopefully they'll
come forward -- has pictures of that handle. They're *really* hard to
find and I'm trying to talk somebody into fabricating replacements.
Anybody? Anybody?

Also, I'm not sure if the 71s have the &quot;silent closing&quot; handle towards
the rear of the inside of the sliding door, but I think that's just a
standard inside door handle. Anybody? Anybody?

Nikki
