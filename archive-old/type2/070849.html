&lt;&lt; I have been told that an 1800 cc engine with duel carbs can be stronger 
than my current 2000cc &gt;&gt;

Bob,

hmmmm, 
Bentley says the 1800cc AW with dual carbs had 65hp, 92.4 ft. lbs torque 
(SAE).  
The 2000cc GD fuel injected engine had 67hp, 101 ft. lbs torque (SAE).

Having run a fuel injected bus for a year now after replacing the weber IDF's 
that were on it, I personally couldn't imagine returning to carbs!  FI 
usually delivers fuel more efficiently than carbs.
