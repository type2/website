&gt;Well, I ain't an expert, but I think it's pretty cheap.
&gt;You need different springs on the valves.

I'm using the same springs.  They work just fine.

&gt;You need different lifters (duh...).
&gt;I think the case needs to be remachined because the hydraulic lifters are
&gt;slightly larger bore?

No, they are the same bore.

&gt;I think the cam is the same. Ditto the pushrods and rocker arms.

The cam is different and if you want to do it by the book, you will have to
change it.  I'm not saying your old one won't work, but nobody seems to
know for sure so you'd be taking a risk.

If you replace your cam, you're obviously looking at an entire engine
teardown which won't be cheap.  Not really do-able unless you are
rebuilding.   If you leave the old cam in there, it's as simple as
replacing the lifters and pushrods, but like I said there are no
guarantees.
