John,

These are not that hard to get out, I guess that could be said for ones that
are not broken. We sell quality used regulators for $25.00. We clean,
regrease, and inspect for any damage. We guarantee all our products for 30
days.

Subject: RE: [T2] Side window stuck


I just did this exact same thing in my '72.  The window was stuck in the
almost up position (about 3 inches from the top.)  The handle just spun
when turned, window wouldn't go up or down.
The Bentley is right on about how to remove the rather large mechanism
(regulator), but it can still be a pain in the A, especially when the
window won't go down.
So the gears of the mechanism are stripped and must be replaced.  It is
all one piece and must be replace as such.  I removed all the bolts
(seven in all) and slid the whole unit down until I could remove the
bolts holding the window to the lifter (the left &quot;arm&quot; of the mechanism
had to be pulled out of the door to do this.)  And then removed the
mechanism per Bentley.
note - after doing this, I realized that the window was only resting on
the 2 bolts that hold it to the lifter.  You may be able to simply lift
the window off those bolts to lower it.
Hope this helps.

----
&gt;Left side window lifting mechanism is stuck.
Nothing happens when I turn the handle.
According to Bentley I must lower the window to remove
the lifter. But I can't move the window down,
it is stuck in the mechanism.
So, what to do, use(more) violence to push the
window down or what ??
