You can buy nice looking cab dividers from PLF vw http://www.plfvw_dot_com/  very
expensive  though. has a vinyl window and snaps with velcro or buttons to the
sides and roof of your bus
jamie


&gt;  I used to hang a thick blanket behind the front
&gt; seats to divide the van when I was alone. This makes the H/E's job easier as
&gt; they only need to heat the cab, as for the rear view mirror, well the rear
&gt; window steams up &amp; unless you have rear de-mist it no use after a couple of
&gt; mins. If you need to see out the back, just drag the blanket across, sounds
&gt; basic but no more blue knuckles ;)
