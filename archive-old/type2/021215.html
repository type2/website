Subject: My 68 Westy won't start.

What's up everybody? Hey my Westy won't start, I checked the battery and
she is 12.5 volts.All of the guages and stereo work when I turn the key
but that's it, no click sound or nothing.I laid on the key for about 20
seconds and the second fuse from the right burned up.Where should i look
first?It  sounded like the starter was binding so i put it in 3rd and
rolled it backwards and it didn't help at all.
Thanks for any and all info.
Casey
1968 Westy
