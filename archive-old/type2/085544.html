Subject: Re: [T2] Door locks

Hi Dan,

One key is supposed to work on the ignition AND all the doors. Every bus
left the factory in that configuration.

Lots of buses (including my own) have had various doorhandles or locks
replaced over the years and may require more than one key to operate them.
This wasn't VW's design, it's just entropy acting in its own special way
upon our vehicles. After 30 years it's amazing the stories they can tell.

My Westfakia still has its original ignition lock, but it came with no door
handles whatsoever when I got it so they ALL came off my 73 parts westy. All
except for the sliding door lock; because the 73 sliding door lock is
different from the 79. The 79 slider lock I have on there now came off a
donor door that belonged to a friend of mine. So my westfakia winds up with
three keys in total. The cost to rekey the ignition and slider is not too
bad; but at the moment there are a long list of other improvements to better
spend my $$$ on. YMMV.


Happy trails,

&gt; So I just bought my first VW (1971 westy in stunning condition) last week
&gt; and I've been running around all this week getting it in shape to move out
&gt; to Yosemite for a couple of months.  Currently, one of the only things
&gt; holding me back are the locks on the doors.  The key that I have manages to
&gt; open the drivers side door, but doesn't turn in any of the other locks...
&gt; It also starts the ignition.  This leads me to believe that it actually is
&gt; meant _only_ to start the ignition and that there is supposed to be another
&gt; key (which has been lost along the years) that opens the doors.  The
&gt; driver's side door lock is probably just so worn down that it works with the
&gt; wrong key anyway.
&gt; 
&gt; But before I go off and pay a lock smith to make me some new keys, I decided
&gt; it would be a good idea to check and make sure that this actually is the
&gt; case... in other words, do the old VWs use two different keys for unlocking
&gt; the doors and starting the ignition?  Also, I'm considering just taking it
&gt; to a VW shop and asking them to completely replace _all_ of the locks for me
&gt; so that I can feel just a little bit more safe about leaving my valuables in
&gt; the bus during the days in Yosemite when I'm out climbing.  Any ideas on how
&gt; much that would cost?  Are the parts to do that available such that I might
&gt; be able to do the work myself?
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks in advance for any help,
&gt; Dan
&gt; 
&gt; PS  Once I finish getting it ready to go, I'm going to take some pictures of
&gt; it and post them on the web.  This bus is in the most incredible
&gt; condition... its hard to believe that its more than 10 years old.  I'll let
&gt; you guys know once I've got them up.
