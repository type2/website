my 78 is randomly and occasionally making a knocking sound, right side,
still not sure if front or rear.  no pattern, can't get it to do it or
stop it once it starts.

can feel it through the steering column, but pretty sure it is not in
steering linkage.
  took both wheels off, thought it might be something loose in the brake
assembly, but all brakes are within spec and no loose parts....?????

drives normally, and stops and steers normally, except for the knocking
(speed linked, sounds like something hitting something as the wheel goes
round)
  CV joints are fairly new, and all bearings and links are tight,,, this
has really got me hanging, and I have to take a 200 mile road trip week
after next


Thanks for any suggestions of where to look
Bob
