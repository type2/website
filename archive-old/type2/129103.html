Subject: bad gas

did I mention that bad gas makes my car run like crap?  I've been trying 
to tune it on Vons gas and recently switched over to mobil and it runs 
so much better (actually starts and idles) and runs about 50 degrees cooler.

I can't remember if I had already posted this, but I thought I'd mention 
it again for the hell of it.  maybe the heat's getting to me...
