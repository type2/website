&gt; &lt;&lt; Craig,
&gt;  I don't think so.  On my old '78 it would run anytime the key was on and
&gt;  the right-side red lever was down.
&gt;  
&gt;  Besides, if that was the case, we wouldn't be talking about it running
&gt;  for a little while and then blowing fuses.
&gt;   &gt;&gt;
&gt; 
&gt; If the above is correct then the blower has been re-wired.  It receives its
&gt; power through a relay which is 'conditioned' by the state of the alternator
&gt; charge-indicator lamp circuit -- the alternator must be delivering a charge
&gt; before the heater blower will operate.

Well, ya learn something new every day.  All the wiring looked
normal/stock but I guess not.  Sorry I ever doubted you Craig :)

So, how many people's blower fans actually only work when the alternator
is charging?
