Subject: hooking up second battery

So what is the deal on how to set up a reserve battery in a 71 bus with the 
1600. Does the generator have enough power to charge both. How should it be 
wired up, and when camping should you switch to use only one or that doesn't 
matter, I also want to put it in a 72 with a 2.0l, that is ours and the other 
is our sisters. thanks for the help
