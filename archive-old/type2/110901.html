Subject: Aux Battery

I've been wondering how the original aux battery was set 
up???  The PO had a cig socket installed beneath the 
closet on my '79, which is only functional with the 
igmition on.  I think that's a pain, but is it corrrect? 
 When parked, interior lights pull juice from the main 
battery.

I haven't begun to check it out, but I figure the aux is 
dead.  Panel registers nada for battery check (I have 
the full frig/panel diags and will do that...)

Seems to me optimal would be:

Both batteries charging when running.
When parked, key off, juice pulled from aux for interior 
lights, sockets, frig, etc.  (Not that I'm gonna use the 
frig on battery, waste o' juice.)
When running,  juice pulled from main???

Any hints on this would be most appreciated!

Teri
