Subject: Re: Opinions Wanted: Governor on Distributor? PLUS Question Porsche six

Jonathan asked:

&lt;&lt;just wondering if anyone has some opinions on installing a distributor that
has a governor that prevents the engine from going over a certian rpm. they
are about $30-$40 and i've heard they are good to have. seems like a good idea
to me. small price to pay to protect your engine.&gt;&gt;

For an even smaller price you can buy one of the Bosch RPM limiting rotors
Steven Dolan described, here are some numbers:

1 234 332 144  &gt;5400 RPM normally used in T4 engines
1 234 332 192  &gt;4500 RPM normally used in 1600 Baywindows
1 234 332 314  &gt;4800 RPM normally used in 1600 'Export' Baywindows
1 234 332 207  &gt;5800 RPM normally used in 4-cyl 914s

You can select one of the above to fit your stock (either T1 or T4) or 009 
distributor. if you have a T4 in your '74 i'd recommend the &gt;5400, this one
is also good for the performance oriented Bus owner who has a better than stock
rebuilt engine with CW crank, for a stock 1600 i'd use the &gt;4800 or a &gt;5000 from
another car, Saab maybe. If someone needs a more specific RPM limiting rotor 
contact me privately and i can sort thing out for you. 

If you have one of these -in good condition- the limit is printed or stamped on
the rotor. These rotors limit as follows, on top of the rotor is a springloaded
switch. This switch is operated by centrifugal force, when the force on the switch 
is high enough overcome the springpressure it will close the contact and the
rotor is shorted to ground untill the spring takes over again and ignition
is restored. Actually, i think that the spark will jump to ground before the
switches physically closes, so it's hard to say how accurate the rotors are
without testing them on a distributor test bench. But i don't think a revolution
more or less will really hurt :)

Now the question: could someone tell me (and the rest of the lists) if 
a Porsche six rotor will fit directly into a VW distributor? This would allow
a wider choice of RPM limits upto 7300 RPM ( ;) ), sometimes even in as little 
as 50 RPM increments.

(trying to have an answer for all Bosch non-electronic ignition questions,
info on *early* VWs is coming, i got access to a 1952 Bosch catalog...)
