Subject: Re: [T2] Oil Temps/A Long Rant

I agree- we did not install the temp gauge and later, oil pressure gauge
until around 200K of driving everywhere, sometimes at a constant 65
mph.  My concern is not so much the temp as the oil pressure- which of
course is a function of the thinner hot oil.  Thus to keep the tired
240,000mi engine oil pressure when hot at 25psi, we'd have to driv at
50-55 on hot days which is around 240 max temp.  Fully floored pulls are
a no no, I gear down! Hill climbs even then can get it to 260.

 Well I have been of the opinion that over 250 is way to hot.
 BUT&gt; My friend who had driven his bus everywhere possible always said
to me:
 &quot;The WORST thing you have ever done to your bus is intall that damn oil
temp
 guage.
 You watch it like a hawk and then you worry. I never put one in mine
and I
 never
 will&quot;.
 
&gt; Maybe he was right.
