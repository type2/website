Subject: Re: [T2] Vacuum Idle Retard connection - 71 DP

&gt; warming up it will not hold idle.  Since it is a 71 it has both vacuum


Check your valve adjustment.

&gt; retard and advance.  I can't find any diagrams in Muir or Bently to show 
&gt; where to connect these 2 items.

front side facing away from dist vacuum hose goes to venturi (narrow neck of 
carb) (correct carb?)
back side facing dist vacuum hose goes to intake manifold (left side riser I 
think, at the top by the split)

&gt; Also, the engine has an aftermarket exhaust.  Hence, the pre-warming 
&gt; tubes, or whatever the connection from the muffler to the intake manifold 
&gt; is called), doesn't line up very well.  Could this connection be causing a 
&gt; vacuum leak that could manifest itself by stalling?

The preheat riser that goes through the tin from the exhuast &quot;area&quot; to the 
intake air cleaner is simply grabing warm air during warm up. The '71 wax 
thermostat regulates itself on engine compartment amient temp and opens and 
closes a flap to divert the air intake from inside the compartment when warm 
and around the exhuast area when not. This only need be pulled from around 
the exhuast.

I hope this helps.
