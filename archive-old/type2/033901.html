Subject: Dawn &amp; PLFVW &amp; &quot;Doing Business&quot;

There is sufficient credible anecdotal evidence to state that:

1. Dawn is in some kind of a personal crisis
2. Dawn is not a first rate business person when in crisis
3. She makes a high quality product

Now something tells me that if Dawn were stuck in I 70 in Utah with a 
dead engine the list would be bending over backwards to get her back on 
the road. But she is not. She's stuck in the middle of a life crisis and 
she has cashed some checks for product she hasn't delivered.

Some thoughts: sounds like she is a craftsperson, not a businesswoman. 
The word is that she makes, not just a good product, but a very good 
product. She makes it. Not her elves, or her employees in some third 
world country.

Except right now she's screwed. Maybe she gets up every morning and her 
first thought is &quot;I've got to make eighteen poptop canvases.&quot; Maybe step 
one is ordering the sunbrella fabric, but she can't because her crisis 
has left her in a deficit. So she sits down, as she has every day for 
the past couple of months, and tries to figure out what to do.

Meanwhile people are sending her cranky e-mails and calling to scream at 
her. So she gets &quot;Richard&quot; to answer the phone for her.

None of the work she will do for the next two months will bring in a cent 
of cash.

Meanwhile, the vaunted type2 list is sounding like a posse of 
vigilantees. &quot;String her up!&quot; &quot;She's a witch!&quot; &quot;Send her mean-spirited 
e-mails&quot; &quot;Bad business practices.&quot;

Because, heck, we want our stuff on time. Time is the essence! Time is money!

We must hold Dawn to the same standard as Microsoft! Because PLFVW is a 
business! Oops, Microsoft can't get it's product out on time (remember 
Windows 95?)

Well, what will end up happening is that Dawn, who is no businesswoman in 
a crisis, will stop doing business. And we will get poptop canvases of 
lesser quality, but on time!

Horse hooey. Can't we help her out? I don't know how (I am not 
businessman!). But here must be something, uh, _positive_ we can do.

Any ideas?
