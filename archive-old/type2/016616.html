Subject: 23 Window

Hello all,

    I need toi get an idea of the value of a 23 window deluxe bus.  I
have looked around on the internet and been to several sites, but very
little info. was available on priceing.  I turn now to you guys.  The
bus is complete, a little rust, some dings, and a cracked window.  I
don't know much else.  83,000 miles, and original paint that looks nice.

Any info would be greatly appreciated!!

thank you for your time,
Chris russow
