Subject: Oil Bath Filter

Hello All,
Me again.  Someone suggested that my blow by culprit may be caused by a
plugged air filter.  So , investigating, I have learned a few things, and a
couple of questions arise.
Bentley talks about the thermostat and shows a cable.  1971, do not need
fuel emission where I live.  Where is the cable supposed to come from?  Mine
is not there.  What about the oil?  does it circulate through the engine, or
just stay there?  What does the oil do?  Will my engine run cooler if this
is in better operating condition, assuming that it is not now?  This engine
is brand new, less than 500 miles and I would like to give it the best.
TIA
