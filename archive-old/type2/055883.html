Subject: Holy moses the hoses!

The Folly is running well even thought the majority of all those hoses
on her Type IV motor are not connected.

Folly has dual carbs... stock... and her measurements are... err...
ahhh  1700cc.  She has an oil bath air cleaner.

Can some one tell me where all those hoses should go Please.  Would
anyone have a diagram?  The bently is not good for this, nor is haynes
or St. Muir.

Thanks

Barry!
