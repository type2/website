Subject: starter solenoid

 I got a new starter solenoid for my 77. My old solenoid had 3 male 
plugs and the new one only has 2. I put all the wires back except the 
one with no place to go now. the bus started and runs fine. just 
wondering why they are different and what that wire might do.... thanks

Doug
77 bus
66 bus

ps. Thanks to those who responded about my cv joint vibration question. 
The cv was fine, one of the rear tires failed and had some lumps in it 
that were casuing the vibration.
