Volks ,

  I have two tubes coming off my carb that were plugged with a sleeve type 
plug that slids over the tube to cap it one of the tubes is the same as a 
fuel line tube exiting the carb. My question is both of these plugs are 
rotted to heck and I cant find replacements anywhere.  Any tips on how to 
manufacture something to cap these two openings that were capoped when I got 
the bus and it was running(I know there supposed to be  capped).

  Thanks,
  David
