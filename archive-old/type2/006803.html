Ian,

The same thing happened to a friend of mine a while back in his '79 2.0l
He'd been fiddling around in the engine bay (as we all do) and when he
re-started it and put it in reverse,it died.
Turns out he had put the wire with the in-line fuse from the reversing
lights back on the negative side of the coil instead of the positive side.
Swapped it over and all was fine.Your problem may be that easy to rectify
otherwise as already suggested,there may be a short somewhere in that wire.
