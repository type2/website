Subject: Re: [T2] Welding Equipment

Have had it, used it, dad picked some of this stuff up before we had the MIG liner and gas for aluminum.  A guy was actually selling it at the Alaska state fair this year for repair of your snowmachine, float plane floats, whatever you are daring enough to repair.  Whatever it is (and I'm not sure exactly on that) doesn't hold up long term in my experience.  You get quite reasonable looking results initially, lasts a while, eventually become porous gray and corrodes faster than the adjacent metal.  Doesn't look/work that much better than MIG welding aluminum does.  A for instance I wouldn't use it for, and my last, wish I had the TIG instance.  Needed to cut off, crimp, and weld some aluminum A/C lines for a Eurovan to remove the rear A/C when recycling lines for an EVC that didn't have it.  The lines from VW were about $800, I had several sets of good used in the other format.  I only ended up paying a guy $10 to TIG em shut, but I wouldn't have trusted the Lumiweld or my
 MIG for the application at 300+ psi and needing a long term gas leak proof repair.  I want a TIG because I want a TIG, that is basically all there is to it, and more for the ability to do repairs on non high strength steel old car bodies and then be able to do hammer and dolly work with heat, which you can't do effectively on MIG repairs.  Plus if the Chinese 3 in 1 machine is of any quality you can't even imagine the fun of having a plasma cutter until you don't have one anymore.

&gt;So, welder John, please bone up on Lumiweld before you buy any new gear!
