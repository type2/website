Subject: Re: [T2] extra hole in shroud

Robert,

Thanks, I'm sure the one that Richard is working on looks as well!
Practically Everything on there that could be, is powder coated!

Yes, all the way to the drivers side.  Mine really is supposed to be like 
a tube, but is was little mangled.

Make sure the tape seals well!  You can lose a whole heck-of-alot
of cooling air out that hole!

Cheers, dave

 Are you and Richard referring to that little item shown in your photo 
 that's all the way on the left of the shroud? Its a small, silver and 
 rectangular, with a cylinder shaped bit coming off the end. I've got 
&gt; one too, and there's tape all over mine. Always wondered about it.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks.
