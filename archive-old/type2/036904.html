&gt;Huh??  How can it be on the 'wrong side'?
&gt;What is the distributor # of this 'wrong side' unit?

Karl, 

The notch on this distributor is 180 degrees out from the notch on my old
distributor. That is, when I point both distributors to #1, the key that
lines the distributor up with the drive gear on the old dizzy is 180 out
from the key on the new dizzy.

So, in order to orient this distributor just as I did the old one, I'd have
to cut away tinware for the canister. This is on a '75 Type 4 engine.

&gt;I believe what he wanted you to do is start with #1 in the cap 180 from
&gt;where it was. But this will cause a 100% misfire. 

That's what I thought, but he insists that's not so. I'm going to talk to
him in person as I need to bring him a core anyway. But if I simply can't
use this distributor, I guess I'd be better off returning it.

&gt;Unless you had a type1 distributor with the 3 degree offset for #3 cylinder,
&gt;it wouldn't matter where you stabbed the distrbutor and had the rotor
&gt;pointing to #1 to fire.

But wouldn't you have to change the position of the distributor drive gear
so that the cam and the distributor were correct in relationship to each
other?

Thanks! Joe
