&gt; &gt;Can you put a late model beetle 1600DP case in a 1970 SC? 
&gt; 
&gt; Sure, buy the adaptor bracket which will allow you to use your Type
1 motor 
&gt; in your Type II bus.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;The mounting holes appear to be on the case of the 1776 motor but
they are 
&gt; filled or plugged off.
&gt; 
&gt; The adaptor bracket bolts to the Stock oil pump cover plate and one
case 
&gt; mating fastener underneath it. Sometimes you 
&gt; have to lengthen the oil pump cover studs.

Since he has the mounting bosses on the case, all he has to do is to
drill and tap them for the rear mount bar.  No sense doing a
Mickey-Mouse installation when a few bucks worth of tools will do it
the right way.  The tools would probably cost less than the &quot;adapter&quot;.
 Also, if the bosses are present, they will probably interfere with
the adapter.

&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Additionally, the 1776 has a full flow oil filter, incompatible
with that 
&gt; rear engine mounting cross member!! 
&gt; &gt;Is there anyway I can make this configuration work?
&gt; 
&gt; I don't know. That sounds custom. Maybe someone else has done it, or
worse 
&gt; comes to worse, switch back to stock oil flow.

It can be made to work with custom fittings, but be sure not to
restrict the flow of oil, as _all_ your engine's oil has to flow
through the fittings.
