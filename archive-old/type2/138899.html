Subject: Re: [T2] Exhaust odor in Bus

Hi Vincent

Have you checked your rear hatch seals lately? If the rear hatch of my bus
isn't closed firmly and sitting flush to the body, my eyes will be watering
in about 5 minutes. The fumes find their way to the front of the bus VERY
quickly.

Happy trails,

coming from the vents, but I think it is.
