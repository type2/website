Subject: Re: [T2] Stranded - Bad Starter? HELP!

On checking the charge of the battery, is the reading on voltage across 
the terminals or cranking amps?  Heat and cold rob a battery of it's 
life.  You may get 12 volts and be able to play the radio and use lights 
but not have enough amps to crank the engine.  Had this happen a few 
times.  Try the jumper cable suggestion or swap out the battery with one 
that you know is good.

If the battery is not the issue then that few whacks on the starter / 
solenoid may do the trick.  If this works it indicated the started / 
solenoid is at the end of it's life and time for rebuild or replace. 
 Don't get cheap in this area of repair!
