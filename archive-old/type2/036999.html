You might also want to check with a trucking outfit.  You could strap the
beam to a pallet and ship it as (I think) &quot;used automobile parts&quot;.  

Let me add a great big Oh Yeah to that.  Last year I had a used Type 4 engine 
(300 lbs) on a pallet shipped from Ohio to Texas by Yellow Freight.  Because 
it was misclassified, they tried to charge me nearly $500.  After numerous 
calls to Yellow Freight customer service, I finally found a customer service 
rep who helped me find the right classification (used auto parts, I believe). 
 That plus finding out they could have offered the shipper a 10% &quot;courtesy 
discount&quot; if he had only asked got the total down to $165.  Be sure you get a 
written estimate first and make sure it sounds reasonable.   At least I got 
another shot at it since it was shipped COD.
