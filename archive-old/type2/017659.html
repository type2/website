Subject: re-keying locks, or, so many locks and so few keys
Message-ID: &lt;3712AA7E.4137CE42_at_escape_dot_ca&gt;

Unfortunately, my quick as lightening delete finger deleted a posting
regarding re-keying locks, ie., how to do it.

I'd really like any info I can get as to how to go about makeing my door
locks work with my ignition key.

Thanks
jdd
