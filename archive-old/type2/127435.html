Subject: RE: Solar Panel

I haven't done it on my Westy(yet) but I would
probably look at using a flexible panel. ICP make
some, I believe. The weight would be less and it would
conform to your roof so it would be totally
aerodynamic, or as much as the bus has ever been. A
few people at my marina have mounted them on there
sailboats in odd places, where a ridged panel would
have gotten in the way. Just a thought.
