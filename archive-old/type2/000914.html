Hi Al

The van was only doing about 4 mph at the time. If it had stopped on the
bumper I doubt it would have done much damage at all. If it had gone faster
then I'd have had to deal with a smashed in front panel and a new crumple
zone under the bumper.

Just as an aside I've seen a couple of front tyre mounts where the tyre sits
low over the bumper with a horseshoe shaped plastic cover on it. The bumper
is then remounted about 6 inches out from its original position, so its
ahead of the tyre, though I imagine the crumple zone is unchanged  Crap
looker though.
