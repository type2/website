   The problem is that even if you get a tool in there, it most likely
is going to strip out the aluminum threads in the head when you take it
out. So be very sure you have to take it out. Replacing them often means
pulling the engine. Maybe even replacing the head, or at least being
able to get a helicoil in it.
