Subject: Re: [T2] torque wrench

I agree that some of the sears tools aren't always the best available, even
for the price as it continues to climb. But what I love about them is that
there are Sears stores just about everywhere making them easy to access. And
they don't even blink if you throw a bent, rusty, mangled tool down on the
counter, they replace it and off you go. I've bought many of mine rusty or
otherwise damaged cheap at yard sales and flea markets and traded them in
for new. I have found that some other chain stores plead ignorance to a
lifetime warrenty, request reciepts, or just plain give you a hard time. I
have also returned a breaker bar only to find out that the 12in breaker bar
I had originally bought had been downsized by a few inches, but same part
number so thats what I got for a replacement. This was the TrueValue
Hardware  master mechanic brand. I bought a socket set and breaker bar from
them in a pinch and have been repeatedly disapointed ever since.
