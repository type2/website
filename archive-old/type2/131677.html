Subject: RE: [T2] Friday Odd Thoughts

To hide difficiencies or PO was to lasy to finish the project or PO got fed 
up with the project all together and threw in the towel. If you can't drive 
it you cant notice a lot of operating problems. These are some of the 
tactics listed in the used car salesman training manual. Available at some 
of your local sketchy car lots.

&gt;From: Don Tuleja Why is it that so many bus's are sold with the engine out? 
&gt;I was just
&gt;browsing through the Samba listings (like I have any $$) and noticed a
&gt;trend... Then I thought about it and realized my first bus, a 69, came
&gt;without its engine installed too.

&gt;Is it just me or is there a reason for this?
