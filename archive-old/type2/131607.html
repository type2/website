Subject: &quot;el Verde&quot; Udate, Ne Problem

Well officially the problem I have been getting with the fuel pump has been 
confirmed. The Double Relay was crapped out. I broke it open and can see the 
broken circuit on the board. I picked another one from Wes Brown in 
Asheville today and BINGO. Key on, Operate the flap and fuel pump engages.


Next problem:

Excelerator cable difference betweeen Autos and Manuals. The cable is longer 
on the manuals. The auto connects to a lever type of device that pulls the 
throtlebody open. I can't remember  what the PO had on there because there 
was a basic cable extender to the Weber. Now one of the core 2.0Ls I got 
earlier this year I found one of these #33 below, with nut #34 attached. No 
I have to try and find the Spring #35, part #36, and clip #37. I can 
probably work out the clip and the part the ressembles a barrel nut. I can 
not find that spring or any specs on demention and/or tension. Beyound that 
i have not read through the Bently to try and find how to adjust this after 
I find it. Any clues leads linkns welcome, if you have the pieces I will buy 
them. Let me know. But if anyone knows whether there is an adjustment that 
needs to be done here I would like to know how and what for. I would believe 
there would be something going on here that might have something to do with 
the idling or running throttle.
