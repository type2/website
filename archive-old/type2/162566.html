Subject: Re: [T2] Re: How about posts of best &quot;workarounds&quot;?

vice grips  don't leave home without em.

broke accel cable on a 78 AUTOMATIC remember the auto trany accel cable
goes to the transmission not the engine...

vice griped onto the linkage and ran a wire tied to the vice grip adjust
bolt thrru hatch into cabin and along the hand grips to the drivers door
grip and pulled that to drive almost 400 miles home

another very tricky manuver with vice grips. broke shift cable to auto
tranny in parents' in law driveway.   had wife stand on brake as hard as
possible while grabbing the shift lever with vice grips and knocked it
into gear.  drove it home the 5miles or so.   make sure you have not had a
recent argument with spouse before trying this.  and no I did not get
under the van.  I crawed under BEFORE starting engine and clamped on the
vice grips THEN started the engine and used a stick to hit the vice grips
to shift into gear, left vice grips on linkage and drove carefully not
expecting them to be there when I got home but they were still clamped on

so always take your vice grips  in both cases I used a little 5inch needle
nosed vice grip. most usefull one I have
