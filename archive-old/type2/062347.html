Subject: '72 clattering noise--more data

well, i putzed around in the engine compartment a bit more and have the
following data to report:

the noise decreases when the timing is way advanced (like 24 deg)

the noise disappears when i remove the #4 spark plug wire (obviously 
pointing to #4 as the culprit

after i removed and replaced the spark plug/wire on #4 several times,
the engine seems to have stopped using that cylinder altogether!  when i
disconnect the wire, the engine's note does not change at all, and the
cylinder seems to be dead at any rpm.  the spark plug is indeed
sparking, and both valves appear to be working.

so, gurus, what is wrong with my bus.  i sure dont have any idea.
