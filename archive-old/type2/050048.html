Thanks to those who replied! Got the new pads with emergency brake levers in
and am up and running again :-)

All it took was Stevo's suggestion -- went to my local VW specialist and got
the pins and horseshoe clips and was on my way. Also figured out why the old
shoes were bad (PO had said they were new) they had been improperly adjusted
- one side worn down the other not.

One question. The hardware that keeps the front door open - On the bottom
connected to the frame on the inside and also on the inside of the door what
is this called? My passenger side door is broken where does one get one of
these? Junkyard?? Also broke a couple of the pins on the door pannel - also
junkyard?
