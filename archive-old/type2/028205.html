&gt;I would think that 60 psi is fine, but the 20 psi makes me think
&gt;something  may be kaput.

Hi Terry,

I wish I had your oil pressure!  I get 60psi when I start my engine, and run 
35-40psi at about 210-230deg on the highway (3800-4200rpm, 70-75mph).  If 
the engine's really hot (250+), oil pressure will drop to 8-10psi at idle, 
and the light goes on at 5psi.  Your pressures sound pretty similar, just 
better.  I'd keep the 20W-50 Castrol in it, and not worry about it.

Happy motoring,

Jason Upper
