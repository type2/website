&gt; My comments regarding gel cell batteries are based on
&gt; the requirement that they not be allowed to reach
&gt; &quot;gassing&quot; voltage, which a simple regulator (like a VW
&gt; bus has) would not control. They seem to be very
&gt; sensitive to overcharging.
&gt; I'm just going on what I learned from talking to
&gt; battery people and reading Johnson Controls (if I
&gt; remember correctly) battery information brochures.

&gt; If people like George are using them with no problems,
&gt; that sounds like a good recommendation to me.

don't take that as a blanket recommendation!  I do parallel small
gel-cells with the battery in my bus to charge them, but this is my
experience only and does not guarantee success.

Most gel-cells have specific charging specifications printed on the side
of the battery.  Get out a multimeter and make sure that the charging
voltage and current do not exceed the stated values.  If they don't, you
should be fine!
