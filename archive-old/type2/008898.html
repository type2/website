Hi, 

I have received some feedback because of a mulitple posting of a message.
When I tried to send it on Saturday morning it would not go but it did not
bounce either. I checked with David Raistrick last night and he informed me
that there was a DNS problem and posts sent to the _at_type2_dot_com addresses may
not be received. In fact it was thought that those messages were lost in
limbo and that this problem may affect half of all subscribers. David gave
me a different address to send them to at _at_digital-galaxy_dot_net and the post
went out immediately. I was quite suprised and embaraseed when all the
originals went out some 24 hours later. Sorry to waste the bandwidth.
