Subject: [T2] long block source in CA

Hi there.  Can someone recommend to me a source for a stockish 1600 DP long
block in Northern Ca, preferably East Bay or Sac/Stockton?  I'm getting
really frustrated with the PO's engine-building antics and am ready to just
replace the whole thing.  Not sure what is salvageable at this point.
Thanks,

j a clary
