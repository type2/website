Don't get too hung up on the tire ratings. They are just the result of
following some standard tire rating equations, they are not the result of
tests that show a tire is fine at 1437 lbs, but not 1438! And weigh your
bus sometime, they are not massive heavy monsters. We run 27x8.5-14 LT
tires, they aiar down for driving in sand and off road, and are tall enough
to slow the engine down a little at highway speeds. We use them on both our
'77 and '65 Westies.   Just a thought. Jim
