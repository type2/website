&gt; 
&gt; Let me guess, there is oil all over the back of the van.
&gt; 
&gt; My guess is a broken ring on one or more pistons causing
&gt; blow by.
&gt; 
&gt; It may go another 10,000 or more miles with out a problem
&gt; (other than adding oil ;-})

	Hm. How much oil loss is &quot;acceptable&quot;? I probably put in half a 
pint every 500 miles, maybe more. 'Course, that ain't a quart, but it's 
enough to make me suspicious.

Ian
