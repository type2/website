Subject: RE: [T2] More Tire FART Goodness! (Vredestein vs Nokian)

&gt; I found these at Discount Tire when I replaced the ones on my 
&gt; 63' Double Cab.  Just a thought.  Proper load range and specs 
&gt; and the ride is nice as well.  Or atleast, as well as it 
&gt; could be for a DC.

We carry this in 205-65R15, which is the same height as the 14&quot; tires found
on later Busses.  It is an excellent tire. We also sell the 14&quot; Vredestein
snows when we can get them. However Vredestein does not sell a 14&quot; summer
tire here in the U.S.  Even if they did, it would cost considerably more
than the 185R14 Hankook RA08, our 14&quot; all-season offering, which IMO is
definitely the best 14&quot; year-round Bus tire available for anywhere near its
price...
