Subject: NEED 96mm Total-Seal rings
Mime-Version: 1.0

For a 2000cc there is the catch.  I really just want a second
(the total-seal ring) for an NPR set of 96's for the 2000.  Problem
is that the total-seal set is for the 1800 ring sizes and I don't
feel like scrapping most of an expensive set.  So if anyone knows
where I could get hooked up with just the second ring in 96mm
bore I'd appreciate it.

Thanks
John
