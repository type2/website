Hi All,

At the vintage meet in Seattle this weekend, I saw a splitty with a 
manfactured fiberglass boat on top. This boat was made to fit the 
roof line and it also had clamp-on wheels that glided on the drip 
rails for loading/unloading ease.

I overheard the owner say it was mfg. in California, but thats 
about all he knew. It looked like it might be 20 years old or so.

Does anyone know anything about these? I want one.

Thanks,

Warren
