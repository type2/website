Subject: 34 PICT-3 accelerator pump squirt

I have two 34 PICT-3 carbs apart on the bench. In both, the stream of 
fuel from the accelerator pump injector hits the top of the throttle 
plate. If I rotate the injector in its socket to re-aim the squirt, 
the squirt hits the side of the venturi before I can move it away 
from the throttle plate. This means that the injector is angled and 
is not squirting vertically downward.

I tried a second injector. Same result.

Is this how it's suppose to be?  Or should the stream travel 
vertically downward just off the side of the venturi and into the 
manifold without hitting the throttle plate?

Thanks, jack
