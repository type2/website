&gt; &gt; Faced with the problem of locating the correct mark on an unknown T4

&gt; &gt; On the scale, as far as I know, the T4 used only one from 72-83, and VW
&gt; &gt; still sells them!  Which is nice because my engines tend to eat them :-(

&gt; The 72-74 type 4 motors (and maybe slightly later) had really nice METAL
&gt; timing scales with white backgrounds and numbers painted on, so if you
&gt; see a 72-74 bus being parted out that's a nice part to rescue!

unfortunately after cleaning one up, I found they do not fit on a later
model T4,  probably Fuel injection was when they changed to the black
plastic.
