Subject: Re: [T2] Fuel line dimensions

[...]


&gt; Hi all,
&gt; I hate to ask such a simple question, but I am a bit
&gt; short on time and today is going to be kinda crazy.
&gt; This morning I was leaving to work when I smelled gas.
&gt; Looked under the bus and noticed a leak in the larger
&gt; hose that goes from the fuel filter to the fuel pump.
&gt; I clamped the hose off and got to work by another
&gt; means. Does anyone know the ID of that hose as I need
&gt; to pick some up on my way home.

I did not see any replies to this.
The ID is 10mm. Good luck finding it at any flaps. You will have better luck
finding it at your local Mercedes dealership.
