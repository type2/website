How does this differ from Japanese/US models with similar sticker  
prices that have several engine options available to the buyer?  
You're suggesting that VW made undesirable models to begin with but  
wouldn't a choice of engines help sell an underpowered vehicle?  
That's why I think it's a mentality. VWoA may have said, &quot;we need a  
bigger engine&quot; and I bet VAG would have replied, &quot;why would you need  
that?&quot;.

As it turned out, wasn't the low price tag and sipping gas VWoA's  
main marketing msg in the 70s ?

VW stuck with the Type 1 engine for 40 years (60 if you consider the  
Mexico/Brazil) production. Bore and stoke went from 75x64 to 88.5x69  
and HP went from 25 to 46! This wasn't a company with large engine  
ambitions and considering the design came directly from Porsche I  
wouldn't be surprised to learn that the non-compete that Nordoff  
signed with Porsche was bilateral and gave Porsche more control over  
its  &gt; 4 cylinder designs.

Maybe the Type 4 engine would have grown to 2.3L before aircooled  
engines choked on their own emissions...

Besides the small block Chevy what other engine has such a vintage  
yet the Chevy is far more powerful today than its progenitor where as  
the 1600cc Type 1...put put put put put.
