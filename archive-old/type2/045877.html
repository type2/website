Subject: [T2] Unruly shift lever

Hello Listers:

While stopped at a light today and preparing to shift to 1st gear the shift 
lever in my '76 Campmobile suddenly felt &quot;loose&quot;.  My right arm and the 
shift lever headed off in the direction of two o-clock and just kind of 
flopped around.  I was soon able to engage first gear and continue driving 
more or less uneventfully.  There are no strange noises from the tranny and 
shifing is, otherwise, smooth.

On returning home later today I experienced the same phenomenon.  Does this 
sound familiar?  Are there bushings to be replaced?  Loose linkage?  What 
should I look for to fix this before it becomes worse?

Thanks for any help and suggestions.

Best regards,
Walt Fogle
