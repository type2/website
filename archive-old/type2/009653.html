The westie has a trannie problem. I started with 2nd being hard to engage.
Now 2nd won't stay in and when reverse is selected it's fine backing up but
as soon as the clutch is depressed every stops. No grinding noises and it
reverses fine, just don't disengage the clutch fully before selecting
neutral.
I know the trannie has to come out, but any suggestions what to look for
once it's on the floor?
