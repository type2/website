Subject: RE: Mike's Poptop Page

After reading the instructions I would suggest that the reassembly
should be done the reverse of how Mike did it.  The way I did it was to
drape the new canvas inside out on the pop top with the top in the up
position.  Then staple it to the pop top with the strips.  The last step
is to drop the top down a bit and prop it up with a shorter 2X4 so that
the metal strips can be screwed in without tension on the canvas.  Using
this procedure I was able to do the whole thing without a helper.
