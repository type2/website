&gt;I'm looking for a 6mm tri-square socket end so I can remove CV joints.
&gt;All I've found online so far is a set of four sizes for prices varying
&gt;from $50 to $90.
&gt;
&gt;Nobody local seems to know what I'm talking about.
&gt;
&gt;Anyone have a line on where to get just a 6mm?

Almost every vwflaps I've been to has had one for about $8 (from EMPI). Barring that, the regular flaps should have a 4 piece set sold by Lisle for about $10-15 that will include the cv joint size. Ask for 60750.
