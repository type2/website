Subject: Re: [T2] Parcel Trays

Depends on the height of the hit- the post 72 busses have a giant &quot;tube&quot; 
welded across the body frame that holds the bumper.  This and the nature 
of the front beam and the longitudinal beams it hits means your floor 
doesn't give that much in a crash with  another car or a pole as with 
earlier busses.  I've seen this tube absorb the hit and crumple inwards, 
leaving the floor unbuckled.  .  However, if you hit a cow, the higher 
body mass may mostly push above the floor and really cave in the weaker 
nose- but the pics I've seen of the cow hit (was around 40 mph) did not 
really go in far enough to damage the driver (if no trays were there)- 
but then a cow weighs less than another vehicle?   If you have 
noncrushable trays, consider the pounds per inch on a plywood edge only 
an inch or less thick slamming into your legs.  As for the steering 
column, don't these have a crush &quot;shelf&quot; attachment to the body?  (post 
67 busses?)

  Yes I agree - non parcel trays are safer, yet just marginally. I think
  in any good front end hit my legs are probably gone.
