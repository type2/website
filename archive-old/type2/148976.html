&gt;While we're on the subject of locking chrome gas caps, I just received a
&gt;long-awaited shipment of 74-79 ones directly from Germany. These have been
&gt;NLA for several years, at least at a sane price.  (Technically they were not
&gt;'discontinued' via the VW dealer network, but there was little or no actual
&gt;inventory and the price was absurd.)

$50 is what I remember.

Thanks for finding these again Ron. Everyone wants one...
