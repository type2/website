Don't know what's causing one brake not to work but you don't need a 36mm 
wrench.  Just remove the 2 smaller bolts on the outer side of the drum.  The 
drum will come right off the hub.  You may have to loosen the brakes with 
the adjusting stars as a &quot;lip&quot; sometimes builds up on the inside edge of the 
drum from the shoe wear.  You only need the 36mm nut removed to work on the 
bearings (I know because I made the same assumption once)
Just thought I'd save you the trouble.

&gt;I'm still looking for a 36mm socket to get a look at the brakes on the side 
&gt;where they are failing, but wondered if anyone else has run into this same 
&gt;problem. Parts needed? Workaround? Thanks in advance.
