Don:

Installing a 1974 or newer Luggage rack seal onto a 1973 or earlier
Westfalia Camper is not recommended. Water can collect under the luggage
rack and cause rust problems.

Thank You!

&gt; I'd like to install a luggage rack seal of the 74 + variety on my '71 to
&gt; finish off my poptop resto.  What mods are involved?  I've read it could
&gt; cause drainage issues, since it didn't come with one stock.  I've ben
&gt; kickin'around in the archives for over a year now, and have gotten tons of
&gt; info on my resto here - thanks.  Finally able to join list.
&gt; Thanks
