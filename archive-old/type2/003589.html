hello I have a 72 bus FS . It was a hard top camper but the PO removed the
interior. It is in great shape , Has solid rockers , the only rot is in some
of the bottom of the doglegs. It has a 2litre with a webber progressive. It
has been sitting for 3 yrs but ran well when parked. It does need rear
brakes. It is located in Aiken SC , $600
Thanks----Bryan
