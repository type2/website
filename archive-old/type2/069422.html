&gt; Given the timing thread I thought I'd on a 'bush mechanics' rule of thumb for
&gt; timing.  It's particularly useful if you're caught without a light after an
&gt; emergency point adjustment,  to get 'new' engines running 'somewhere in the
&gt; ballpark', or with a *worn* engine that runs like a dog when set to the
&gt; standard mark .........
&gt; 
&gt; With the engine AT IDLE, turn the distributor (advancing timing) until the
&gt; engine runs at its fastest...this point will be clearly heard...(the revs will
&gt; pick up to a 'peak' and then die as you over-advance).  Once you've found this
&gt; 'peak'  turn the distributor back at bit (about 1/4 &quot; retarding timing about 3
&gt; degrees).......
&gt; 
&gt; If the engine won't idle, hold the throttle open so the engine is running at
&gt; the lowest revs possible and start from that point........last stop should be
&gt; with engine idling.....

Your advice is sound; I have used this same method for years. I am
pleased to see you agree that the timing must be pulled back from the
*peak* performance spot! Its like dino-tuning. If you dino-tune your
engine and use it on the street, you'll fry it! It might work on the
strip for your *X.XX* second run, but for continued use you'll waste
your engine.

Another little trick. 

You can static time without a light using this method:

1. pull the HT lead from the dist. and hold it about 1/4 inch (5 mm)
from the case (be carefull, it bites).

2. Slowly bring your crank around to the timing mark.

3. When you hear the spark jump (and you can hear it), stop!

4. Check to see where it is. Its just like using a light only you
listen.
