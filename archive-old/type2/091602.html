Subject: Re: [T2] Head temperature sensor headache

List, 
Please forgive me. Some days my blond shows through
more than others. I thought about it and I realized
that I was looking for the wrong thing. I was trying
to look up the temp sensor by the type of engine that
I have rather than the type of f.i. that I will be
installing on it. I am installing a Late year bus f.i.
system on it. I looked it up under those terms and
found the correct sensor for around $14.00 at the Bus
Depot. 

Oh, when I said that my sensor was loose, I ment that
the sensor it self was seperating. The wire freely
turned inside it.

Thanks again for all the help. You really got me
thinking. Next time I will consult my brain before I
ask such questions.

Thanks again!

&gt; &gt; &gt; I havent worked with a 914 2L, but if it is fuel
&gt; &gt; &gt; injected that sensor is
&gt; &gt; &gt; important for the injection. It controlls the
&gt; warmup
&gt; &gt; &gt; encrichment and so
&gt; &gt; &gt; on. Personally I would get the correct part and
&gt; not
&gt; &gt; &gt; one that Just looks
&gt; &gt; &gt; correct
