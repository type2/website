There's been some discussion about roof-mounted a/c systems, and an
assumption that these are mains powered for parked motorhomes.

There is another kind of roof-mounted a/c system, here in Australia.  It is
12v powered, and I have seen it on top of various buses.  I'm told that
it's evaporative, not refridgerated, and thus for some reason is more
useful in our tropical areas.  I seem to recall that when I once enquired
about the cost, it was well over AUD$2,000 (about USD$1,100?).
