&gt; &gt; 	Just out of curiosity George, why do you believe that a powerful auto
&gt; &gt; stereo would have to be 'annoying'?
&gt;
&gt; &gt;Because if played at the intended volume in an urban setting it subjects
&gt; &gt;everyone within 50 yards of the vehicle to the musical tastes of the
&gt; &gt;stereo owner.
&gt;
&gt; And a ton of other things are equally annoying including typical Harley
&gt; exhaust systems and the overly popular diesel powered trucks.  The fact that
&gt; some people find these types of stereos annoying has little to do with
&gt; alternator requirements.

You were not asking about power requirements, you were asking why I found
high power stereos annoying.  The fact that other things cause annoyance
does not lessen the annoyance caused by high power stereos whose owners
don't know the proper place and time to crank 'em up.

&gt; Talk about terms being used incorrectly...  audio level can't be measured by
&gt; wattage.  It is that simple. Wattage results in an audio level in this
&gt; discussion, but how much is greatly dependant on the efficiency of the
&gt; speaker, the enclosure it is in, the ambient level of the &quot;small enclosed
&gt; space&quot; to name only a few.

OK, if you want to get technical, we have to talk about decibels, and we
have to have a reference level to work from.  I was
referring to the power being delivered to speakers of ordinary efficiency
in a fairly typical vehicle interior.  30W into four channels is capable
of delivering about 90dB sound levels (quite loud) without excessive
distortion in a
typical bus interior.  I've measured these levels (both sound and power
input) with the appropriate instrumentation.

&gt; I agree that the statement could have been re-worded to make you happier
&gt; George,

No, the statement should have been reworded to make it clear that you were
only talking about very high power stereo systems, say of 200W or more.

 but I have to agree with Eron on this one for this fact:  If someone
&gt; took the advice to just get the smaller alternator without anyone knowing
&gt; just how big the system is, it would be bad for everyone when it ended in
&gt; more trouble.

Both routes have consequences.  Why swap out the alternator before you
know what the true need is?  Simply adding up the maximum current draw
of all the parts is not a good way to size the alternator.  The modified
alternator is likely to be less reliable than the stock alternator.  Have
you considered this possible consequence?

&gt; Your 100W amateur radio does not pull the kind of instant or even continuous
&gt; current that a true high end system would.

No. but the 800W (output) amplifier might give it a run for its
money!

If you're pulling more than a couple of hundred watts
continuously with an audio system while you are inside the car, then you
are either deaf or you have spectacularly inefficient amplifiers and
speakers.

&gt; Having installed &quot;several
&gt; stereos&quot; by no means makes anyone an expert on the power requirements of a
&gt; true high end system.

No, but the fact that my installations have been from scratch, from raw
components, and including custom speaker enclosures and door panels might
mean that I know something about this equipment.  Having an engineering
degree, 15 years in industry working with avionics and sonar equipment, as
well as being a full time physics teacher might mean that I know
something about how to deal with units and size power systems.

  So I'll word this easier.  Having worked in both
&gt; sales and installation of the premier Audio Chain in Dallas, TX (Earmark Car
&gt; Audio) I can tell you that there are plenty of systems that would benefit
&gt; greatly from the alternator upgrade.

Yes, if you have a full-blown system.  99% of bus  people are happy with
less.  If I were selling such systems, I'd probably push the &quot;ups&quot; too.

&gt; You mentioned all of those cars
&gt; running around with the 55A alternators and I can tell you this:  I can kill
&gt; any of those charging systems in less than 12 months with 100watts of rated
&gt; power.

Funny, lots of folks install a couple of hundred watts of off-road lights
on such vehicles without ill effect.  What is special about a 100W stereo?
Why would it take 12 months?  Your statement sounds more like sales talk
than verifiable facts.

&gt; Just install two Orion 225HCCA's and run them mixed mono, pull the mono
&gt; channel down to 1 ohm on say 4 DVC 10&quot; subs...  I'd be surprised if the 55A
&gt; alternator made it long at all.  And lets don't even get into the short
&gt; lived battery in this scenario.

You don't understand the function of an alternator regulator.  Its
first job is to regulate voltage.  Its second job is to limit current so
that the alternator won't overheat.  No load will induce the
alternator to produce more than its regulated current output.  If you try
to draw more, the alternator voltage will drop until the load is taken up
by the battery.  If the battery voltage drops, the alternator voltage will
follow it down to maintain the maximum current output.
