Kristin, traveling on a deadline toward CA just called me about 70 miles
outside Memphis. 
Please read through this note and see what you think. She's had a string of
bad luck and now is fighting a &quot;bucking&quot; bus on the way in. Here's what she
described to me:

Her '71 DP bus is basically bucking between gears. She says when she
shifts, she feels like the bus is pulling back on her. She said the bus has
basically no power, but she also told me that she's able to make speeds of
50-60...so there's *some* power there.

I'm actually thinking fuel delivery as in fuel pump, but I could be wrong
here. Hope I'm right, as I'm pretty sure I have a spare fuel pump for a '71.

Here is some of the other info I got from her:

She had a bad mechanic experience where dude didn't tighten the flywheel
right and it flew off into the bellhousing, chewing tranny. She managed to
get it to another mechanic who pulled the motor and made things right. 2nd
mechanic had to turn the idle screw on her 34pict3 all the way in to get
the bus to run, but I guess he thought some of the problem would just work
itself out and let her go on her way, emploring her to take it easy. Funny,
he pulled a 30pict off because he thought that was why she had no power.
Maybe mechanic #2 missed something too, but at least he did her right as
far as flywheel fix at a reasonable (what she could afford) rate.

Obviously, the details I'm getting just before midnight here are a little
sketchy, but I told her to come by early and I'll try to help her before
work. Any ideas would be appreciated. Remember, the main symptom is bucking
on the highway, especially between shifts. She also mentioned that she's
having to lift the gas pedal up with her foot to reduce RPMs in traffic,
which I'm wondering about.

Could this have something to do with the brake booster and possibly a
messed up diaphram in that?

Thanks! Joe

PS. If you're between TN and CA (I-40ish, I presume) and you want to leave
contact info (city and phone number) for her, I'll pass it on just in case.
Thanks! Joe
