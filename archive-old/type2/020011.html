As I recall, back in the 60s, I was buying US graded fuel rated by the MON
(Motor Octane Number / US).  Chevron premium was 103, Union 76 premium was 104,
and Sunoco 260 was 106.  Regular was 93 to 96 octane.  As the change to the
calculated average method came about, the ratings reflected the result of adding
the MON to the RON (Research Octane Number / European) and dividing their total
by 2.  This always resulted in a lower than MON rating at the pump.  This caused
a lot of concern and discussion among high compression engine owners.  The
reality was, It was the same gas with a different number attached.

In the 60s, premium gas had up 3 - 5 grams of lead mixed in per gallon.  In the
70s, US laws required the lead to be removed over time.  Most, but not all, cars
for sale in California went to catalytic converters and unleaded fuel in 1975.
This was followed by the US (49 state) standards in 1976.   At the same time,
Germany, and most of Europe did not go to catalytic converters and unleaded
fuel.  I think it was the late 80s or early 90s that Germany went to the
unleaded and catalytic converted cars.  Many parts of the wrold still us leaded
fuels.

What does this mean?  (Beats the heck out of me)

As late as 1982, I was still able to buy Union 76 leaded premiun for my stock
10.1:1 compression Chrysler 440 CI engine I had in my 74 International Pick up.

So, using specs out of a 1978 owner's manual may not reflect the current
requirements needed in regards to todays formulated and re-formulated fuels.
One way to tell your particular engines fuel requirements is the use a head temp
guage and monitor temps with different grades of fuel.  If regular and premium
fuels give identical readings, use the regular.  If, however, the heads are
cooler running mid-range or premium, use the fuel giving the coolest reading.

I use regular in my 1960 single cab, But I built it with a 5.8:1 compression
ratio.

&gt; AHHHHHH!!  So that is why in Europe the gas ratings are 90/95/100.  And all
&gt; the time I just thought they had better fuel refineries!
