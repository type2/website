Subject: Re: gas mileage

roland sez:
The 1.8L FI in my '75 Westy has consistently produced 20-21 mpg at an
average of about 55-60 mph. With a 2.0L FI and unstated mph it is hard to
know if your 15-16 is reasonable or not. What average mph were you logging?
Aside from examining the plugs, you might want to check the timing and dwell
angle, tire pressures, and any signs of dragging brakes to see if you can
increase it a bit.

in my 1.8L newly rebuilt my family and i took a drive after local break in
process. before the trip i had the seemingly absolute best fuel injected
mechanic in the county (relocated to walla walla, ummph) go over everything
with me in my driveway. he pulled out his snap-on suitcase and measured,
tested, poked everything. our family, travelling lightly, went up from
eugene along the coast via astoria, around the olyimpic peninsula via 101,
across to port townsend, bellingham, seattle and south on 5. until seattle,
we averaged 50mph. seems crazy but you can get away with that on a trip
like this because nobody was out there, and heck, the speed limit is low.
by time we got to forks, wa., i realized something wasn't right as my mpg
was under 16. so confusing...the rig has never gotten very good gas
mileage. brakes a a-ok.  thanks for the thoughts, i'll letcha know how
things go as i take notes on fuel consuption. i'll be taking 5 south so
i'll be able to collect some consistent data, especially in the flats. but
this is it, if i get less than 17mpg i'm getting a horse. is there a horse
list around? okay, man leaving for todos santos, c-ya there high noon at
the hotel california.   - steve
