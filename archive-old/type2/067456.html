Mice can get anywhere they want.  They either dematerialize to get through
the metal, or they shrink real small (perhaps they time-shift, I don't
know).

I do know they can get into almost anything.  Where I live, we do not
have the domestic mice at all, only the so-called Deer Mice, aka Whitefooted
mice, aka Hanta Virus carriers.  They like to store acorns in my heater pipes.
Can't figure out how they get them up into there, but they do.  Perhaps the
woodpeckers team up to do this.  Our woodpeckers drill holes in almost anything
and stuff acorns into the holes (they are Acorn Woodpeckers, mostly, but
we have at least six different species).

We have lots of fun critters around here, the other day I had a tarantula
wandering about in the van (his entrance was aided by my 13-year-old son).

We have marmots, too.  These clever critters seem to think that radiator
hoses are edible.  They have hit many cars (but the cars have to be parked
for a while -- backpackers get a fun surprise when they return to their
cars).  It has been speculated that they like the taste of anitfreeze.

VW content:
Among our local critters, we have bears.  Not grizzlys (thankfully), but
the smaller, somewhat gentler black bears (but ours aren't black).  The
bears like to eat garbage that the tourists provide.  It has been claimed
that they can read, with the words &quot;Coleman&quot; and &quot;Igloo&quot; particular favorites.
It seems, years back, when Beetles were ubitquitous, that a particularly
clever bear learned of the air-tight quality construction that was such
a hallmark of the VW (did you ever see the rather tasteless fake-VW ad
that showed a floating VW with the caption &quot;If Teddy drove a VW, he'd be
President today?&quot;).

I digress -- back to the story, man!  This bear figured out that if you
are 250 kilos of ursine physique, using the top of the VW Beetle as
a trampoline rewards you by convieniently popping open its doors, providing
access to all those goodies the friendly backpackers were too lazy to
carry with them.  No Beetle was safe all along the Tioga Road, not with the
Beetle-bashing bear bouncing them around!

So, yes, mice get in, whenever they like, wherever the want.

So can bears.
