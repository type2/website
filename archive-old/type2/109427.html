Subject: [T2] Timing Help?'s


&gt; I am ATTEMPTING to set my timing right and was reading up on the procedure
in
&gt; the Bentley Manual, then went outside to see what the part # on my dizzy
was
&gt; and it turned out to be 231 178 009 (050  Z42?)which was not in the
Bentley
&gt; under the section on timing, at least not in my version.

009 dizzy , go to www.oldvolkshome_dot_com

&gt; but I'm not certain and if some body out there could tell me
&gt; where this motor came from based on the engine (AS) #111 101 102D it also
had a
&gt; #37 right next to the VW symbol on the case before the engine

This is just a casting number.
The engine number is located below the generator stand.
