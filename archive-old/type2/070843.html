Subject: AFM disconnected: Was...Still No Start (77FI): Ideas?
Message-ID: &lt;a86c1758.247b270f_at_aol_dot_com&gt;

I have been having trouble with my 77 westy (2.0L FI),  I have not been able 
to get it to idle smoothly.  It keeps skipping and stalling unless I keep 
reving it.  
Here is what has been done.  new points, cap, rotor (timing set, valve 
adjusted), fairly new fuel pump and filter (4k miles), NEW coil, Checked the 
fuel injectors (all spraying nicely).  Sooooooo...
after reading all the posts about the disconecting the AFM and the bus still 
running I thought I would give it a shot.  WOHOOOOO!!!  it idles like a champ 
but won't run much above that (makes sense since that's what would tell the 
injectors to open longer (more fuel))...so I then checked the resistances 
between the terminal (7 terminals)..just barely out: 308 between 6 &amp; 9 
(should be 100-300) and 207 between 7 &amp; 8 (should be 80-200).  Is this the 
problem??  I wouldn't have thought that being out by only 7 or 8 ohms (out of 
200 or 300) would cause such caos???  Any thoughts??

BTW I am going to borrow a  known working AFM from a great mechanic in 
Natick, MA.  He has been extremly helpful (evidence by the fact that he's 
going to lend me a working AFM).  If you are in the area and need a VW 
mechanic (air cooled or water cooled) you should give him a call; Greg's 
Repair (508)647-9749

Please let me know if you think the AFM is the culprit.

Thanks,
Mike
