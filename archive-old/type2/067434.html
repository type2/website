Subject: New Guy 1967 Deluxe

Hi. I am new to the list having just gotten my first bus this week. It is a
67 deluxe? (the mechanic told me that). Unfortunately someone converted it
from a passenger van to a camper. I wish I knew a source for the original
type seats and windows they threw away.

It runs good, but needs front end work (link pins, tie rod ends) and a
brake job. It runs well and shifts fine. The body has some rust around the
doors but not a lot. I also will need to find a rear bumper.

I am 46 years old and live in Smyrna, Georgia. Glad this group exists.
