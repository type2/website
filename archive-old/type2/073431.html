&gt;Hi,
&gt;In my humble opinion, most rebuilt heads arrive ready to bolt to either side.
&gt;On the right, you don't need the sensor hole.  On the carburated engines with
&gt;Air Injection Reactor systems (Smog pump) Original heads were drilled with one
&gt;A.I.R. passage on the left head and two on the right.

Only in model year 1974.  73 busses had two holes on both heads (total 4).
72 of course did not have the air pump at all.  74 and 73 heads are
different in other ways as well (valve size).  All 73 heads can be used on
either side of the engine with no modifications.  74 heads were sold as
&quot;left&quot; and &quot;right&quot; by the late Mark Stephens High Performance.  Same with
GEX.  Don't know about other rebuilders.
