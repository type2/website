Subject: Re: Advice needed for a 78' bus (fwd)

 &quot;S. Hajasz&quot; &lt;hajasz_at_visi_dot_net&gt; asked about heater pipes under a 78 bus....
If you are referring to the large 4' wide pipe that runs the length of the
bus, try a LAMPOST.  It's good round sheet steel and you can find a way to
splice it in if hand with metalwork..   You could also try the flexible
metal piping that is made for ClothesDryer ducting; the latter is easy to
cut into and splice in whatever you want with duct tape. I b;ocked up the
pipe going to middle channel in Westie to let more defrosting reach the front...
