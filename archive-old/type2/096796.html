Subject: accelerator stop bracket

Hello again; 

I've also misplaced the small bracket of metal that serves as an throttle
stop - the piece that sits in the floor of the cab and prevents the
throttle from being pushed all the way to the floor (in combination with
the extended tab of metal already on the pedal). 

I don't remember this stop bracket on my other bus - why is it there? Is
it essential? 

Cheers
dan curran
