&gt; ...I agree with Jim. 3M Super Weatherstrip Adhesive on the covers only is
&gt; advised by Harry Pellow, the 356/912 Guru, and I have been using it
&gt; exclusively for many years with no problems whatever. The problems I see
&gt; with VC gaskets is they will shift about upon install, or swell and push
&gt; themselves out of place. The adhesive is needed to keep them firmly in
&gt; place. Hylomar will not do this, nor will Permatex. And there is no place
&gt; on the whole frikin' machine for RTV.

Well, I dunno.  Most gasket shifts occur during initial install and unless
you have several hours to wait for the weatherstrip adhesive to set (with
the gasket properly held in place) it will be just as slippery as anything
else.  I've never had a shift with Hylomar (it's really tacky when under
pressure) and I can't say the same for
weatherstrip cement.  I think that the scraping (and inevitible scratches)
involved in cleaning weatherstrip cement off the cover result in more
annoying drips.  My Mexican engine valve covers have been off a dozen
times and still have the original unscratched paint as the sealing
surface.

Since I do valves every 2000 miles, the easier cleanup with hylomar is
significant in time savings.
