Subject: bus cad

 
--This info should definitely be collected somewhere. I run Autocad too, and have been translating one of the bentley wiring diagrams into cad format so I can make changes to my &quot;working drawing&quot; as things happen to the bus. 

Does anyone have bus &quot;plans&quot; they'd be willing to share. It'd be awesome to create some blueprints of these things. A few of us could probably make it a project and skim a few bucks off the others for our trouble.

&gt;Save it in 2000, it can be opened and re-saved in any format.

Or I can manipulate it into a few different formats if you send me the .dwg files.

&gt;P.S. I might be able to get good measurements from my headliner, sliding 
&gt;door, and door panels this weekend and post the .dwg files Monday. This is 
&gt;will be for a '78 Westy. Would that be the same as ane arly baywindow?
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;

&gt;&gt;How about this:
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;I'll generate a basic AutoCad .dwg for the sliding door panel, as I think
&gt;&gt;that would be the easiest/best way to get all of the necessary dimensions to
&gt;&gt;you.   I'm no AutoCad expert, but I do use it in my work and know enough to
&gt;&gt;be dangerous.  What version - 2000, 14, 13....?
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;I can plot it full size and check against my bus to be sure it fits.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;If you don't get any offers on the other panels I could check mine as best I
&gt;&gt;can without taking stuff apart to seriously.

&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Actually I would be glad to make a full size (24&quot; X 36&quot;) set of blueprints
&gt;&gt;for all the 68-72 Westy interior birch panels for the VW community and even
&gt;&gt;the door panels and the kick panels too. I have most of the original pieces
&gt;&gt;and could make the prints on AutoCad, but I need 2 things:
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;1) dimensions for the headliner, which I believe should be fabricated in 3
&gt;&gt;pieces. I also would need the dimensions for the driver's side panels. Russ
&gt;&gt;it would save me time if you could take some dimensions for the sliding
&gt;&gt;door. I have the rear deck lid panel and the trim pieces in the rear around
&gt;&gt;the spare tire.

&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;2) somebody to check the dimensions by actually using the blueprints before
&gt;&gt;making them available to the public.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Anybody have those dimensions? A good way to check the dimensions is for
&gt;&gt;somebody to measure theirs against mine too.
