Subject: Fuel filler opening

On 75 and up buses, there were 2 different 'birds beaks'; the rubber elbow at the filler neck opening. One for
regular sized gas nozzles (211201119) and one for unleaded [smaller] nozzles.
The restricted one has not been available for quite a while and people that need it for smog checks have been
in trouble.
I have found a couple of buses that had a VW factory plate held on with 4 screws that has a restricter hole
made in it. [like the Vanagon one, but Vanagon uses 3 screws]

And yes, the VW factory locking gas cap will work with it.

Barry had mentioned something about this on 11/25/03:

&quot;So, nobody's got the 'birds beak' filler neck for you poor people with
California FI buses that need a catalytic converter and the restrictor to
get past the California inspection angels!?!?!?
Well, I thought Steve Dolan gave me the answer for your situation.  Until -
- -  I came across this item in Bus-Boys site:
B.  211-201-551R  Gas Cap, Locking, Black, 1974 to 1979  $15.60
NOTE:  The 211-201-551R gas cap will only fit models with the stock filler.
It will not fit if an aftermarket metal restrictor has been added.
Wow, is Bus Boys saying that there is an 'aftermarket metal restrictor' that
can be added?!?!?
If so, why hasn't any of our special VW providers mentioned them??&quot;

This is not an aftermarket restricter, it is a factory one. No part number on it.... just like the
unrestricted one has no number on it. If anyone wants one....let me know. :)
I only have one available. I can send pics of it.
One nice thing about it: it will keep gas pump jockies from tearing up your good beak!
