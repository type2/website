Subject: RE: [T2] Plastic/Fiberglass Glovebox Source?

&gt; I called around on this when looking for one last year.  Bus Depot
service guys, 
&gt; at 215/234-8989, called theirs a &quot;insert&quot; but the guy at Rocky
Mountain Motorworks
&gt;  told me it was plastic replacement box.  So I went with the RMM one.
I'm happy
&gt; with what I got.  Heavy gauge and fit like a charm.  Definitely worth
the money spent.
The two plastic boxes are probably the same product.  Ron Salmon at BD
Inc. can
&gt;  probable tell us the origin of each and solve the mystery.


Yes, they're identical. Both come from EMPI.
