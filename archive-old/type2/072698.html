Steve(n):

Normally I'd agree with you about surveys, but this thread has been very
interesting to me.  It has given me a better feeling and understanding for
who is on the otherside of the ether on our fabulous list.  It hasn't put
faces on the names but it has given me a better understanding of our follow
Bus brethren ( and sisters).


By the way,  I'm a semi retired home builder.  I got tired of working for
uncle sam and decided he could suck someone else dry so I've cut down to
just enough work to make the ends meet and do what I want with my time
(tear buses apart). My &quot;77 (Green Bean) bus has been with me from the
beginning.  I have built several camper interiors for it over the last 22
years depending on needs, kids etc.  It has been our &quot;see the world&quot;
vehicle for the last 22 years.

There's a sign in its rear window which says:&quot;LAUGH!..Its paid for!..22
years ago&quot;

Have fun
