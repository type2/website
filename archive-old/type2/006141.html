Quick Question:  I'm assuming that the little black &quot;dipstick boot&quot; fits
between the case and the fan housing on my 1978 2.0 rebuilt engine, right?
Do you need to seal it or put clamps on it to keep oil from blowing out, or
do you just slip it on?

My previous engine was a 914 engine an had a completely diferent dipstick
set-up.

Thanks a lot,
