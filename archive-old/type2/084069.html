Subject: Re: [T2] '78 Westy Suspension

Collie, Bob and all,

I'm particularly interested in the question about lowering as I've been
thinking about doing it on my '73 panel.  

Has anybody used or seen the lowered spindle approach.  From what little
I've seen on it, you don't have the ride problems like the adjustable
beam. True... or fiction?

Comparing my van with others, I'd swear someone turned up my torsion
bars front and back.  It's got 15 inch wheels and P205/75 tires.  Even
with these bigger tires, there's at least five inches clear of fender,
probably seven inches from the top of the wheel well.  By they way,
those tires give it about a 2% under speed on the speedo, compared with
a GPS.

It's nice not having to jack the van up to roll under, but looks wise,
I'd like to lower it.  My wife say's it's harder to get into than my old
Landcruiser which was up there a ways.

&gt; &gt; don't bother, buses have a reason for being the height they are

&gt; Very true, but I chose to lower my '77 for the look, and it looks great! I
&gt; noticed a significant increase in bounce, rough riding and overall
&gt; discomfort.
