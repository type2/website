Subject: Re: [T2] numbers

Ace codesleuths Phil Cain and The Rat well picked my mis-reading:

&gt;Are you sure that the dizzie is not 211 905 205S  ?

	I apologise for sending a wrong reading.  Sure does matter to 
read these things aright!
	The help in tracing this ('71 beetle dizzie, on a '73 motor; 
not the feared, loathed 009 and quite OK so far) from these gents is 
impressive &amp; appreciated.  (BTW that table in the Tech Arts has 
several obvious errors, and the '1 or 2' column is undefined.)


thanx volks
