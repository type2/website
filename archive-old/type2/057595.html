Subject: If not GEX, the where?

I have received several responses to my mention that I was buying an engine
from GEX.  They suggested I read the archive, which I should have done
anyway.
So, OK, if I can cancel my order on Monday from whom should I buy my engine?
My mechanic knows a one guy in the Dallas area who rebuilds them one at a
time
in a one-man shop.  That was who he was going to get one from, but the guy
was
3-4 weeks behind.  A couple of people suggested I do it myself.  Nice
thought,
and I'd love to learn how someday, but it is impossible this time of year
for
me.  So, where can I buy from that I won't hear horror stories about?
