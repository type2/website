Subject: Asking for suggestions and advice about &quot;Lucky Two&quot;'s Interior
  . . .

BlankI'm finally getting around to asking some questions.  These questions 
pertain ONLY to the interior . . . .NOTHING mechanical!  And I also know 
Lucky is not REALLY a type 2 Westy . . . but the insides are so similar, I'm 
hoping someone might have some good ideas.
I understand that MOST &quot;first&quot; questions are about TIRES . . . but thanks to 
the Archives, private emails, and all of the stuff I've already downloaded 
for Granddad John, I'm not going there.
FEI . . . (For Everyone's Information) I am the computer guru in this family 
 . . John might control the TV Flicker, but I control the computer 
keyboard!  So when HE asks the questions, I'll be doing the typing.
HONESTLY, I did try to search the Archives for stuff about the interior, but 
either I missed something or didn't type in the right &quot;search&quot; words.  I DID 
see the gorgeous work done to an '83 Westy,
back in 2002, but I think it was a bit more than I can handle.

I'll try to be brief and precise.

If you can log on to our site at: 
http://www.geocities_dot_com/nannarose70/pagethree  you can see what I'm talking 
about.

1. I'm thinking the best thing to do is to sand down the panels and PAINT???
2. Has anyone purchased and installed  the headliner available from &quot;Go 
Westy&quot;?
3. Has anyone found an EASY way to remove/rehang the curtains?
4. Is there any way to install arms on the front seats?
5. What can be done about the many cracks in the Formica . . . I GUESS it's 
Formica . . . this is the worst of all of our previous vans.

That 's probably enough for the moment.
Hoping to get started as soon as Lucky gets home from the German Motors 
Shop.
