If it's starting to grow, it is probably beyond help.  time for a new seal
and windshield.  The expense of a professional repair (assuming that they
can do it) is close to that of new glass.

OTOH, I've picked up a couple of rock chips in Montana (in Montana,
the &quot;gravel&quot; is about the size of your fist) and have found that quick
action can prevent the little 1-inch stars from growing into long cracks.

The first thing to do is _not_ to allow water to touch the new &quot;star&quot;.  If
it's raining you're already sunk.
Stop at the first FLAPS you happen upon and buy a &quot;windshield repair kit&quot;
which consists of a syringe of either silicone or 2-part epoxy.  I've used
both and they are about equal in performance.

Forget about any idea of a &quot;perfect&quot; undetectable fix.  It won't happen.
The goal here is to minimize the damage and prevent further damage.

Follow the instructions and apply the kit.  Don't skip or add steps. 
You'll find that the star is a lot less noticable, but it won't go away
completely.

The important thing that you have done is to seal the crack from water.
If water gets into the crack and freezes (yes, it does freeze here in
SoCal now and then) the crack will grow.  My bus has two stars that are
several years old that seem to be perfectly stable.  I do tend to be very
gentle with the glass and I never put water of markedly different
temperature from the glass on it.
