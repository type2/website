Subject: Tranny Measurements??

I need to find a BIG box to ship a 73 bus tranny in.  I was supposed to measure 
the tranny this morning before I left for work so I'd know what size box I 
need, but of course I forgot.  Does anyone have one laying around they could 
take a rough measure on real quick?  Just need to know the length from the 
output shaft to the end of the nosecone and the approx width/height.  I'm on 
digest mode so if you wouldn't mind, please e-mail me direct.

Thanks!!
