Subject: Fishing boat Fluff &amp; Trailers

I recently have been curious regarding *if* and how much of a trailer that a
type II splittie can tow. I am speaking of the fully loaded RFH camper and
classic 1948 tear drop trailer. There are past threads in the archives on
this general subject that I need to research.
Shoot, I have been interested in simply keeping the engine cool without a
trailer! Regardless it looks like I will be going with the temp and pressure
gauges as well as the 72 pass cooler and fan set up via the full flow case
and filter. &lt;Using the Hoover recommended A/N 8&gt; My initial (uninformed)
feeling is that &quot;common sense&quot; would be not to tow anything other than a
teeny motorcycle sized tag-along if that. It would be cool to see a splittie
towing a vintage trailer but on the other hand blowing the motor on an
uphill grade with a mile long back up of traffic sitting behind you would
not be cool or inexpensive to remedy. Being a smart aleck on the e-list is
one thing, being truly unwise and not taking caution while on the road is
another. I attempt to recognize the difference.
