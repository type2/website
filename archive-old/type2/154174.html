Subject: Re: [T2] spark plugs

From James Jackson:


 Hello, quick question (hopefully)
I just did a tuneup a bit ago and
part of the process was changing the plugs.
The motor is a 1700 fuel injected beast.
Old plug Bosch W8CC
New plug is WR8CP (Bosch)
It was on Bosch's website

This info was in the finder there:
 WR8CP   PLATINUM PLUG CJ, GE; Gap=.028
 W8CC   O.E. SPARK PLUG CJ, GE; Gap=.028

 Does this mean I have the right plug? Just oem vs whatever?

 ----------------------------------------------------------------------

WHAT Bosch website??

It frosts me when I see spark plug listings that say platinum or resistor plugs are &quot;recommended by the
manufacturer&quot;.

Total BS..... they are recommended by the PLUG manufacturer, NOT the VEHICLE manufacturer. The plug maker is
reaping the $$ off you. I see it all the time on Mercedes-Benz. People go to Kragens, Pep Boys, or Smucks and
get sold crap and then they bring it to the dealership because it won't run right or accelerate. &quot;I just put
new plugs in it and pimply-faced said they were the correct ones.....&quot;

I searched the web just now for any Bosch factory website that tells me what plugs I should use and none of
them did. They all sent me to retailers.

Then I searched for websites that sold Bosch plugs and the 1st 20 of them said to Plus4 and this and that
resistor/platinum crap without even asking what vehicle I had!

Then the 21st one at least wanted to know make year and model, and lo and behold, ONLY the correct plug came
back:
