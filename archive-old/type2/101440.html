Subject: Re: [T2] Plumbing &amp; Fuel Pump for a late BN4 Gas Heater

What type of switch should I use besides the timer switch. Is 
there a cheaper alternative? Those can be a little pricey
sometimes. I would like to get a timer, but that will have
to wait 'til summer when I am working more.

&gt;take a short piece of straight pipe slightly smaller and &gt;slide it into the
&gt;flex pipe and clamp it at the right length

Slick idea Bob! I like that, it may not be the 
prettiest solution, but it will fit my wallet nicely! :)
