&gt; Anyway, is there anything I can do short of running down to the local VW

well I have lengthened a cable at the front end, at the point it goes in
teh barrel nut grab the front end of the old cable, cut off about 6-8
inches or so, put cable through barrel nut and use the other end as
normal.

hope that makes sense, hope the vanagon is like the late bay too.
