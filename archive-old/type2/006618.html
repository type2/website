Volks -

I'm just had to come out of &quot;digest hiding&quot; mode to share a great discovery
with y'all!!

I found a 1969 Westfalia owner's manual in the farthest recesses of Itch's
spare tire well. In the back portion of the manual, I found driving safety
instructions on a page labeled &quot;appendix F&quot;. To wit:

&quot;Refrain from popping wheelies, as this inhibits the ability to steer the
vehicle&quot;.

&quot;Keep your speed under 160kph (100mph). This will aid in fuel economy and
keep insurance costs down&quot;.

&quot;Do not attempt to take corners past the rated .92G's. Though the vehicle
will remain upright, the tires may peel away from the rims, causing a
potential hazard&quot;.

&quot;The maximum recommended speed with the top up is 100kph (62mph), with the
wind&quot;. (my note here - remember that the '69's hinge from the front, so I
think they're saying you can use it as a sail, but only to a safe speed of
100kph)

&quot;Check local ordinances before walking to the cabin icebox for a beer while
the vehicle is in motion. It is not legal to drink and drive in some areas&quot;.

&quot;Do not fill the fresh water tank with more than 3 gallons of Mai Tai. This
will allow for expansion as it warms&quot;.

&quot;Do not admire yourself in the closet mirror while the vehicle in is
motion&quot;.

&quot;When using the cable TV receptacle, ensure you have enough cable to reach
your destination&quot;. (my note here - has anyone every found said receptacle? I
didn't know they had cable in '69).

&quot;Do not use the rear window defogger voltage terminals to run a large string
of holiday lights. This will surely cause your fuse to blow&quot;. (wish I'd read
that sooner!)

and finally...

&quot;Do not pass Corvettes when going uphill. This will totally blow the
impression everyone has about busses being slow&quot;.

Wow!!

So, you can understand my elation when I stumbled upon this page. From now
on, I'm going to abide by these recommendations, and I should suggest that
y'all do the same.

I'll go back into slink mode now. Happy holidays!!
