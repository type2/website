Subject: Re: [T2] Administivia: Vendor/buyer relationships.

I *am* on duty this week, and I purposely didn't stop it.  I agree with
Steve completely about the list being an open forum for discussion of type2
vendors, as long as it stays objective and civil.  I think Ron answered the
complaint gracefully.

As an aside, posts along the lines of &quot;I don't think we should discuss
vendors on the list&quot; have no legitimate bus content and should never be
sent to the list - they should be sent to the administrators directly at
type2-admin_at_type2_dot_com where we can all discuss it offline till we are blue
in the face.

&gt;Well, first, I have not stopped it because I am not &quot;on duty&quot; this week.
&gt;But! Even if I were I would not have.  The list policy has always been
&gt;that we welcome vendors, we support vendors, but we do not shield vendors.
&gt;Neither do we shield purchasers.  The list has always been open to reports
&gt;of &quot;bad apples&quot;, vendor or buyer.
