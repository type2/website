X-Diagnostic: MESSAGE REQUIRES APPROVAL

[...]

I'm a bit more antsy about propane fume accumulation than Jim is, but we
usually tote our small bulk propane tank under the rear seat/bed in our '70
Campmobile.

We've used the same bulk tank for 22 years, with regular inspections and
re-certifications, and in all that time and travel we have had one [1]
propane leak inside the bus.

We'd had the tank topped off before heading to Yellowstone NP, and somewhere
E of Moses Lake all 3 bus occupants simultaneously smelled the telltale
stink.  I immediately pulled over and we all bailed out of the bus.  I
yanked the tank outside and found that the main valve and the overfill valve
hadn't been properly closed by the attendant.  As the tank warmed up and the
bus gained altitude [we live near sea level] the expanding gas forced its
way past both valves.  I bled off a couple of blasts of propane, retightened
the valves, and we resumed our journey.

Many times, before and after this incident, we've crossed high passes in the
mountain West in 90+ temperatures and never had the slightest seepage due to
expansion of the propane in the bulk tank.  I don't know the popoff pressure
for the overpressure valves on bulk tanks, but it must be pretty high.

The disposable tanks/bottles are made of pretty stout steel.  We've
&quot;experimentally&quot; holed empty bottles with a .22 rifle at ~50' range, and if
the slug doesn't hit squarely the result is usually just a big dent and no
drama.  A few times we've fired at bottles that were perhaps a third full.
When they did finally blow the bang was impressive but the damage to bottle
and vicinity was nothing spectacular.  The bottles always stayed in one
piece  -  no shrapnel or craters.

The critical thing to remember is that propane is heavier than air, flows
like water, and will pool in any low spaces or pockets.  The Portland-area
guy who blew up his boat, his breakfast, and [a little] himself yesterday
learned that lesson the hard way.  Profit from his mistake and use common
sense and you shouldn't have any problems.

FWIW.....

&gt;&gt;  Well, mine's bolted to the frame rail under the sliding door ;o)  The
smaller bottles just float around the interior. (A place for everything and
everything in its place!) I 've never had any problems with leaking bottles.
120F or no.  Waaaay too many interior air leaks for it EVER to be a problem.
