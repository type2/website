Subject: Re: [T2] Not Getting Enough Fuel at Highway Speeds-Solved

Thanks for all suggestions about not getting enough fuel at highway
speeds.
Turned out to be a bad fuel pump.  I checked the lines and the tank
filter
and all were clear.  I then did a flow rate test on the pump.  It pumped
at
about 40 ml per minute, about one-tenth of the spec. If I were to do
this all
over, I would have unplugged the inlet to the pump first as a quick
check on
the lines and the tank filter instead of draining the tank and removing
the
fuel filter.  Any way I now know that everything is clean.

I decided to replace the electric pump with a mechanical one I got with
a 73
beetle engine that dropped a valve about 25 years ago and was sitting in
a
basement ever since.  Pump works great.  Nice to be able to use the
highways
once again.
