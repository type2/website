Volks,

I think &quot;learning by my mistakes&quot; should be my middle name...and no...I'm 
not referring to the actual ownership of my bus.

The master cylinder:  the brake lines hadn't be tightened enough.
Wheel cylinder:  the brakes weren't adjusted evenly, creating one side to 
pass by the valve and leak.
Defroster:  no problem, hooked up the fan, and freed up the levers (now it 
is hot, but good for re-inspection.
Exhaust:  I don't know what the guy was smokin'?!  I cannot see any holes 
or feel any holes from the tailpipe/muffler, to the heat exchangers, to the 
engine.  Now, part of the engine shield is slightly chewed up, but I don't 
think they were that stupid.  Since, the defrost wasn't working, the hot 
air was blowing out the back of the flapper boxes...the guy probably felt 
the heat blowing and said, &quot;exhaust leak.&quot;  (Unfortunately, my better half 
listened to the whole list of issues and when the guy said exhaust...he 
just figured not to ask since we had so many other problems.)
Steering:  I have to order the bushing and replace it.
Marker lights: one bulb...woohoo.

So, that being said, does anyone have a good list of steps for replacing 
the steering bushing?  It is well worn and cracked...very brittle.  It 
looks like a PITA to get to.  Also, is there anything else that I should 
replace while I've taken the time to remove these parts?

Thanks again for the continuos support!
