Subject: Gas milage....again
Date: Sat, 30 Sep 2000 18:19:34 -0500

Hello everyone,

 Well, I still have my gas mileage woes to contend with. I went to Bill
Keating's house last weekend to see if I had any fuel injectors leaking,
which I didn't, and found one with the improper spray pattern. Swapped it
out, but I still get bad mileage, 14.3 mpg.

 I went to the type_dot_com and ran the fuel injection problem list in the
library section where it suggested that the culprit could be either the
pressure regulator or head temp sensor. I have no way of testing the
pressure regulator but did test the temp sensor. The sensor read 2.3K ohms
at 64 degrees which seemed about right since Bentley has it at 2.1k to 7 k
at 68 degrees.

 What else do I look at? Would a lot of blowby cause crappy gas mileage?? Am
I missing anything???

Thanks!!
