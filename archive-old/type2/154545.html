I would be interested in at least two units. I already researched these and
their &quot;base&quot; model (which puts out almost as many BTUs as a BN6) runs $1200
bones last time I checked.

Lemmie know,

Holy cow, guys. I have a tennant who is an authorized eberspacher
dealer. Who on the list would be interested in a group purchase if I
can get him to import some of the &quot;petrol&quot; models?
