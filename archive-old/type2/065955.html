Dave Eccles rote:

&gt;The Split  - Bay hybrid you refer to is truly a fuuny animal! We have one in
&gt;England...just fully restored and converted to RHD.

They assembled these from Brazilian CKD kits in South Africa from 1976 to
1978. They were all RHD.

And if you think they're funny animals, then did you ever hear of a
Volkswagen Fleetline? No? Well, listen up: In 1975 (one year only) VWSA
assembled 849 CKD kits of RHD Brazilian Split-Screen buses, vans and
pick-ups. I own a van (battered daily driver) and a bus (awaiting
eng/trans) and they're a real hodge-podge: VW emblem in front panel is
pressed in the panel, not a separate badge; side loading doors are to
barndoor-type (flimsy) construction; pre-64 pull-out door handles; pre64
small rear hatch and so on etc.

They ran on 14in rims and were powered by 1600 twin port engines turning
12V alternators. There were three variants: Bus (with windows all round
incl corners like pre64 deluxes but no sunroof or skylights); panelvans
(with big [deluxe] rear window in small rear hatch); and wide-bodied
pick-ups, the rarest of them. Why they were sold under the model name
Fleetline I don't know, but it was boldly emblazoned across the rear hatch.
I think Fleetline is a Chevy (truck) model name from the 50s. They sell
Isuzu (GM) pick-ups here now called Fleetline as well.

The Fleetlines and the later Bay/split hybrids were sold alongside regular
Bay Window Type 2s, assembled here with something like 50% by mass local
content manufacture, but the Brazilians were a cheaper alternative. All the
Brazilians, including the deluxe lookalike bus, had rudimentary masonite
interior paneling.

And you thought the last splitties were built in aug 67?
