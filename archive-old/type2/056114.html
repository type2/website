&quot; ... Secondly, the bell housing, and/or tranny input shaft lengths are
different in the 2 families. I have hear of this problem from 2 sources.
One is chapter 25 of the 'Idiot book'. (You'll need one of the newer
copies of the idiot book, mine does not have a chapter 25). Oddly
enough, a buddy of mine has a 2k engine bolted to a 73 tranny and has
been running like that for 2 years! ...&quot;

When I put a two liter in my '74, I was all ready to have to swap input
shafts and bellhousing etc., which my searching of the archive had
convinced me was necessary, but it went in without a hitch as it was.
Perhaps some listee has an extra of each style transmission that could
be set side-by-side on the garage floor and measured, hmm?

Perhaps some apparent length of transmission problems could be the
consequence of year-to-year differences in the block of metal that bolts
to the frame, holding the two prongs on the nose cone to the frame.  On
some of them, at least, the holes are closer to one side than another
(also, some have indentations for the prongs, but this shouldn't show up
as a length problem).  So it could be just a matter of turning this
piece around 180 degrees.

I was happy that I hit no snags in my transmission swap; but am curious
about what problems others had.
