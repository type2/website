Subject: Pushrod Tubes, again...

Check out where the seal goes on the small end of these two tubes. One is 7mm
one is 4mm. Other than that the two appear identical. I noticed the same thing
with the ones that came off my bus, but the ones with the larger space had a
strange looking slot down the tube. Consensus was the ones with slots are not
stock, but this represents yet a third version.

One with a slot down the tube and 7mm width on the small seal end

One with no slot down the tube and 7mm width on the small seal end

One with no slot and 4mm width on the small seal end.

Strange....

So which is stock on a 76 2.0 the 7mm or the 4mm? Incidentally, the seals I
got from Bus Depot fit best in the 4mm so I'll try that size and see what
happens. Just curious about the various versions.
