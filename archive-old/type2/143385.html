&gt; Will anything besides monitoring heat prevent
&gt; this?  Loctite them in?  Epoxy?  My engine was
&gt; running cool when the seat dropped, and I'd like
&gt; to prevent it from happening in the future.

hello Jen   monitoring the heat is the best way  , locktite and epoxy will 
not work  when you say your engine was running cool how did you know  oil temps? 
head temps?  what were they??   Later  Mark Dearing
