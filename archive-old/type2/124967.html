Subject: Stupid things in instructions....

I just picked up my dual Kads (EMPI kit). The following is stated in big
bold letters on the first page of my instructions.

&quot;NOTE: ON CARS WITH ORIGINAL FUEL INJECTION, A LOW PRESSUREFULE PUMP
(41-2000-8) AND CENTRIFUGAL ADVANCE DISTRIBUTOR (00-9443-B MUSTBE USED.
ALLPPLICATIONSWILL BENEFIT FROM USING A CENTRIFUGAL ADVANCE DISTRIBUTOR&quot;

I almost fell out of my chair when I read this...
