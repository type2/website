Subject: Re: [T2] Engine conversion 

&gt;&gt;It's one of those interesting experiments that
works well as long as it's just a handful of
folks across the country doing it. 

\Without a doubt, used fryer oil may not meet the
needs of every aspiring veggie owner as demand
increases.  However, we currently pay almost
every farmer in the US not to grow things.  Some
get paid not to grow anything at all, and almost
all get paid not to grow on certain portions of
their farms.  (It's a good deal if you can get
it.) If we needed more corn or soy oil, we could
probably meet the demand fairly easily. 
Personally, I would rather pay a farmer than pay
future Arab terrorists... or a Marxist dictator
in Venezuela.  Even if the veggie oil is in short
supply, you could run regular diesel and still
get excellent mpg.
