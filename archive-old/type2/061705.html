Subject: Busted '73 bus (2 of 2) -long-

OK, it was Monday (yesterday) 3 PM, and I got a few hours off early for
comp time.  I was tooling around the Washington Beltway (I-495/95) inner
loop from exit 2 (Alexandria VA) going out towards Springfield to visit
my NEW favorite junk yard for a nickel and dime part that you CAN NOT
buy at your FLAPS.

I must be a reincarnated WW I biwing pilot.  I drive my '78 Westy like
the hay wagon it really is, but I constantly looking to the
left/right/behind/up (for helos that are out to get me speeding!!). 
Yesterday, out of the corner of my right eye, I flash a pile of 'junk'
cars (actually a tow lot) and a fraction of a second later, a blue
body/white top vehicle on a road just inside the beltway.

It has gotta be a VW baywindow bus!!  The colors and impression are
burned into my head somewhere.

So I immediately pull off the beltway at the Van Dorn exit (Of course I
am in the right lane!!  I wouldn't be comfortable with vehicles speeding
past on BOTH sides of me.)  I go left at the light, down the hill at
South Van Dorn, and just under I-495/95, I take the first right on Vine,
inside the beltway.  (Locals, take note of these directions.  They won't
be repeated!!)

Well, there it is.  A blue/white bus that looks abandoned.  I drive by
and swing back around, and stop across the road (a dead end road) from
the bus.  

Yep, it is sitting on orange jack stands, so I guess someone got to the
engine.  Walk to the bus and check the VIN.  It's a '73.  The windshield
is OK, but it has plastic bags full of stuff inside that makes it
impossible to see inside the vehicle.  But through the windshield I see
some mighty nice engine cooling tin inside, and another nice piece which
looks like a fan housing.  I go to the back, and it says 'automatic'.  I
pull the engine hatch and sure enough, there is nothing but a really
clean transmission housing. Auto.

I walk to the right side, and there is a SIDE STEP on the bus.  Of
course, I bounce on the side step to see how it works, and the sliding
door opens, and what to  my wondering eyes should appear, but . . . 

No, not Santa, but a much bearded David Karis (the present
owner/occupant).  A young 50 years old.

Of course we get to talking.

(I have to shorten the story now.  I am sure I am losing audience)

David has been running this same '73 bus for the past 16 years.  He is
from California, but left there when he could not pass the smog police. 
I think the bus is licensed in Arizona, expiring next month.  He kind of
lives in it. Kind of.

He has a kerosene heater and a portable radio.  Also in the passenger's
compartment is the long block 1.7   David pulled the engine and tore it
apart along the side of the road, all by himself.  He has TWO broken
pistons, and he was looking for someone that could weld aluminum so he
could get the pistons welded.  Also, there are a few valve guides that
he would like to get replaced in the heads.

Well, David found the Buggy Barn, and Paul's, and Ted Dinkelacker's
place in Falls Church (he is broke down within walking distance of the
Van Dorn subway stop).  He was looking for some 1.7 pistons to replace
the broken ones, and he figures he can get back on the road if he gets
them.

David has no where in particular to go, but he prefers being mobile
(don't we all!!).

Buggy Barn quoted some outlandish prices for head work, and David
quickly sized them up.  He only asked Paul's about replacement pistons,
and forgot about asking for a full engine.  Ted Dinkelacker offered him
a 1.8 of unknown condition for $500, but David forgot to ask if it could
be delivered.

David is living off Social Security disability, and is quite content
with his lot in life.  He has been sitting in this same spot for over a
month and I am only the second person he talked with since he was there.
This side road is so desolate that even being there for over a month,
David was not hassled by the police.  No one really cares about his
situation, and David understands and accepts that.

I tried to explain to David about all the resources that are available,
all the parts and engines and junk yards and rebuilders and . . .  But
none of this is available to David, who is broke down along side the
road.

I offered to take David to Penny's yard in Dale City, where I know there
is a full engine (size unknown), with a carb sitting on top.  But David
has an acknowledged problem with decision making. Really.`

David really seems like a nice guy, but I am a bit worried about him
when the weather changes.  I don't know how he lives in his bus, but
it's must be rather Spartan.  With the engine in the back, and all his
accumulated spare parts, and his daily living essentials, he is
cramped.  He is living in a space that is smaller than my cubicle at
work, smaller than my closet at home, and probably smaller than my bed
at home.

I really got to thinking about him last night, and I decided to make
this posting.

David needs help.  I will ask around for the mechanical pieces (Like,
RIGHT NOW!! --&gt;  will a 1.8 fit his needs?  Any problem hooking it up
with the automatic?  

     Does anyone local have an extra 1.7 or 1.8 set of P/C?  His heads
are opened a bit, probably for 1.8, and the 1.7 has a bit of slop in
there, though work just fine.  Of course, I will pay UPS if there are
any extra P/C out there.  I am sitting with 2.0 resources but I
understand that will take a different crank shaft and rods.  And the
header ports would be mismatched, I believe.)

Mostly, I feel David could use some honest type 2 comrade.  

Any lurkers out there in Northern Virginia (and I know you are there in
Alexandria, Arlington, off Ox Road, and around Springfield), please go
out and visit with David during the daylight hours.  If you get off work
early some of these days before Xmas, it would be a nice touch.  He
doesn't need charity or Xmas gifts, but just someone to know that he
exists and that someone is concerned about him.  But then, don't we
all!!  

Andrew S, if David ever needs a tow to a more friendly spot, I know you
can help him.  Stop by and let him know.  

If David does need new 'living' spot, there must be some places nearby
where he can crash.  Where are they!!  Vine street, on the other side of
Van Dorn would be my first choice, right next to the mary-ju-wanna
fields.  The lot on the corner of Vine and Van Dorn has potential.  

Looking at David's setup, I am wondering how long he has been on the
road.  Where has he been. Without wheels, he cannot get to a library to
try this internet stuff he heard so much about.  I told him how to
enter   TYPE2  in the URL, so he should have that much in his
repertoire. 

Well, enough.  Advice is solicited on the 1.8 going into a 1.7
automatic, and if anyone have a spare set of P/C for David, please
P-mail me.  I will try to get his (bus's) head problem worked on, and I
will stop by one more time today on my way home.  Perhaps even for
lunch. 

Local NOVA people, let's handle this!!   (Bret and Patrick and Les, in
this case, Annapolis MD IS local NOVA!!)
