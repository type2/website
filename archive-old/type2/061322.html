Jon:
You're right!
The push type outer door handles got abandoned in 69 as one of a whole
list of DOT mandated safety changes. I guess their thinking was that in
a side swipe the trigger could be actuated, thus opening the door.
Most all cars had different door handles between 68 and 69. Doors in USA
imports starting in 70 had some additional strengthening for side impact
intrusion protection. I've heard of grey- market cars having to have
these installed. Actually I much prefer the 69 up inside locks, although
the outside triggers seem to freeze in the stuck open position in sleet,
in my locale (midwest). So, unless you're a stickler for historical
perfection, I'd recommend you find a right door of 70-73(?) or so
vintage to get the additional safety features. 
As an aside, has anyone else noticed how tinny 68-69 doors sound
compared to 70 up doors when closing? The ones I've compared had a much
more solid, quality, sound.
