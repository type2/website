Subject: Dells vs. Webers


&gt;
&gt;
&gt;&gt;One thing I have had 2 people tell me is that I should look for some Delorto
&gt;&gt;dual carbs. Does anyone have these?
&gt;
&gt;Yes.  They are nice carbs and if parts were readily available, I would 
&gt;recommend them.  BUT, parts are extremely scarce and there are just not 
&gt;many of them out there so all else being equal I would go with the Webers 
&gt;so you will have a larger support base (parts, tuning advice) to draw 
&gt;from.  You WILL have to tune them!   John _at_aircooled_dot_net has some very 
&gt;informative tech articles describing carbs and tuning issues on his web site.


You just have to operate in the right circles - the Italian cars - like 
Alfa Romeo and Fiat have their own clubs and catalogs. There are parts 
available you just have to look in the right places. Certainly not he 
quantity of parts out there for Dells vs. Webers I'm sure but I doubt any 
of us will be without repair kits for the immediate future.

I've got a set of 36mm DRLA down draft carbs and a set of 45mm side draft 
Dells..
