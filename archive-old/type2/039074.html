I have a non-walkthrough 1968 bay window parts bus. The front seat seems to
be of the 1/3-2/3 type. I don't know how it is installed as I never looked.
You are more than welcome to it if you want to come get it. TBear

I'm interested in finding, fitting or fabricating a centre front seat for my
1970 Devon.
(To convert it to a non-walkthrough)   - But I'm (still) not really sure
whether this can
be done with stock parts or not.

Was there ever a true non-walkthrough bay-window bus ?
    (I'm sure there must be, but I've never seen one.)

Or alternatively, can anyone give me details of how such a seat might be
rigged up.
(Obviously safety will be an issue)

Thanks in advance.
