I have a set of regular and deep well Mac sockets a friend gave me 20+ years
ago, and if you wipe them off, they look almost brand new.  He was a
professional and those were all he used.  They've served me well (and yep,
deep sockets are real nice, sometimes just plain necessary).

30 years ago I read in a M*otocycling magazine the old saying that Craftsman
tools were &quot;... 3/4 the best tools you could buy for 1/2 the money.&quot;  It's
probably about still true, and mine work just fine, and yes, I've taken them
in, plunked a broken one on the counter and walked out with a brand new one,
no questions asked.  Electric tools might not work that way, but &quot;hand&quot;
tools do.
