Subject: Timing trouble shooting....

Ok got a question...I attempted to set the timing on my Bus..it's got a '74
1800 dual carb engine.  According to the VW book (Bentley's) it should be
set to 12 after TDC.

Currently it's running at about 12 before TDC.  When I attempt to adjust it
towards the 12 after it start running badly and when revved the 3/4 cyl
backfire through the carb...  any ideas?

I have not checked the points yet, I wanted to get type2's opinion before I
started on it again and I haven't seen anything in the books relating to
this...could've missed it...it was getting late...

PS!!!  WHEN YOU GET A NEW BUS REPLACE ALL THE FUEL LINES...NOT JUST MOST OF
THE FUEL LINES!.....AND GET A NEW FIRE EXTINGUISHER!!!!   (I know it might
be redundant to say on type2_dot_com listsvr but hey.  And yes I was an idiot
and didn't replace ALL the lines...luckily when I was checking the above
problem I found that one of the carb's fuel lines was just starting to leak
at the 'T'  which is of course right above the center line of the crank
case.  needless to say I wasn't very pleased with myself....and relieved I
found it before I drove 50 miles home...
