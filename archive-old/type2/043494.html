Well, mine's bolted to the frame rail under the sliding door ;o)  The smaller
bottles just float around the interior. (A place for everything and everything
in its place!) I've never had any problems with leaking bottles.  120F or no. 
Waaaay too many interior air leaks for it EVER to be a problem.
