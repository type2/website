Subject: RE: Porsche 924 gauges in 73 bus - long

I finally got some pics of my new gauges posted (924 gauges is my 73
Westy).  Anyone that is curious can see the jpegs at
http:\\lonestar.texas_dot_net\~gensler\bus

Let me know what you all think:  Cool, Stupid, OK, Ugly, whatever - I'm
curious.  Personally, every time I get in the bus and drive off I love
them.  It makes the bus look much more modern.

The tach and gas gauge seem to be right on.  The speedo reads 1-3 mph
high.  The temp is the one that bugs me.  I still haven't got back to
the pick-n-pull to see if I can get the temp sensor from the donor 924
so my temp gauge currently reads way too low (as in it never gets above
1/4, even in 100 degree weather at sustained 70mph).
