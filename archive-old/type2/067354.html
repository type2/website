Subject: Pushrod tube tips

Ok, I just managed to get the heads off my '74 and I learned something
new: the pushrod tubes come out *through* the heads.  I thought that the
heads needed to be romoved to get the tubes out.  My lame manual say
nothing about this feature that I discovered by accident.

This good luck saved me a lot of time and frustration tonight, so I
figured I'd pass it along in case anyone else is silly enought to actualy
try and pull one of these monsters out of their post-72 bus.

Further updates on the head swap coming, along with photos on my web page.
BTW, when I looked at the number 2 exhaust valve, I noticed why there
wasn't any compression: the valve moves at least a quarter inch sideways
in any direction.  Yikes!
