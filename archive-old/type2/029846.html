&gt; One thing to keep in mind if you do want to put Bus wheels on your trailer,
&gt; you need to use trailer tires. Bias ply tires are used on all trailers for a
&gt; very good reason. They track straight. If you put radials on your trailer,
&gt; they tend to wander and handle very poorly. Ask anyone that thought they
&gt; could save some money and tried this. They will tell you how poorly that
&gt; trailer followed the Vehicle.

I've used radials on trailers in both single-axle and tandem
configurations.  Never had a problem.  As long as the CG is ahead of the
axle the trailer will be stable.  Allow the CG to get aft of the axle and
the trailer will be unstable regardless of the tires used.
