&lt;&lt; I should have mentioned that I only burn about 3 gallons a YEAR. Much less 
than many, many folks use to heat with in a week.

Yes, but do you have a heat exchanger connected to recycle the wasted
heat into the hot water system in your house...?-) As with most things,
there's more than enough &quot;energy&quot; to go around; it's the storage that's
the problem. The heat wasted in the summer would probably go a long 
way in the winter...If one could only figure out a way to store it until
needed...
