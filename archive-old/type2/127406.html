Subject: RE: [T2] Hidden Danger in Low Mileage Tires

The max pressure was 65 PSI, so I'm pretty sure these were load range D. They were rated for 1650 lbs. Brand
name: Merit, YP-821.


&gt; The tires were Dunlop/Hercules YP-821s (as
&gt; recommended in the tire faq in 1997) - passenger car tires that
&gt; shouldn't have been used in the first place
