Be careful to look at the metal ring that buts up againsted the CV joint and 
see whether it is flat or has several raised nubs around it. I had this problem 
with the spacers where I had some that fit one kind of boot and one that fit 
another and I needed 11 of the others. Some have notches cut out and some don't.
