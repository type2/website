&gt; Old busses are swell, but the mufflers only last a few years. Then, they
rust.

Have you been using German mufflers, or the cheaper
Mexican/Brazilian/Taiwanese ones?  The German Ernst mufflers seem to last
quite a while (although not as long as Stainless, I'm sure).  I sell the
complete kit for $95 with listmember discount. This includes an actual
single-tailpipe Bus (not Bug) muffler, damper pipe, tail pipe, bracket,
gaskets, and hardware; in other words, everything.  Far superior to any of
the South American or even Danish mufflers, not to mention the Taiwanese
extractor systems, and for nearly the same price. Fits thru '71.

&gt; It appears that VW Heritage in the UK now has stainless mufflers for
&gt; upright engines (about US$103.00). Yes, you have to pay shipping

I believe this is a Bug (two-tailpipe) muffler, which, while it will bolt up
to a bus, is not correctly designed for it. If so, it is about 3x the price
of a comparable German made non-stainless bug muffler, so that is the
premium you are paying for Stainless. To my knowledge there is no stainless
bus-specific one. However, if I am wrong, and there is sufficient interest,
I could certainly import it, as I have a container leaving Europe next
month.  Feedback?
