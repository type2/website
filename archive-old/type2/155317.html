&gt;I looked again at the new heads from BusDepot and dont know why i was
&gt;thinking they were german heads....they dont mention that these are AMC
&gt;heads...

If you look at the details you'll see the brand listed as AMC:

&gt;Is timing the only thing that can effect the richness/leanness of an engine
&gt;with the L-jet?

While timing will affect the engine temperature, the air fuel mixture is what has to be adjusted.

&gt;I am familiar with the parts and functioanlities of the FI,
&gt;but i did not know of a specific way to adjust the FI to get leaner or
&gt;richer - I do know that there are many things that can effect that (vacuum
&gt;leaks, incorrect fuel pressure etc etc) Maybe this FI stuff should move to
&gt;another thread, but what is the difference between the CA and the standard
&gt;FI?

The air flow meter (AFM) is tunable. You can adjust the idle mixture and the driving mixture. An exhaust sniffer is the best way to set it.
