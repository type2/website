Subject: Part prices

I'm selling a bunch of random parts from my bus: front
grill, headlights, seats, sidemarker/taillights, stuff
like that.  I have absolutely no clue how to price
these.  I'm probably gonna post em on the samba_dot_com so
keep an eye out if you need any of them.  But any help
anyone can offer, thanks alot.
