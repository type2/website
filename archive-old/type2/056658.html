Subject: fuel sender
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

ok, a year ago my fuel gauge stopped working. 77 westy tank and
gauge.
since I have the engine out and I am making major repairs I was
about to pull the sender in the tank. But after the dust settled,
I saw two wires. One grounded and the other not connected to
anything!
this mysterious wire has a double male connector on the end, and
I can not find the wire that it attaches to.
I cant figure out where it went.

SO... my question is:
should there be more than two wires?
if not, is the dangling wire supposed to be + coming from the
gauge?
And, how does this thing work any how? is the sending unit a
resistor or something?

Thanks for your input,
Thom
77/73 westy in baggies
(will it be painted and put back together in two weeks? I'll keep
you posted)
why does it only take 16 hours to strip everything off and out of
a westy body, but forever to put it back together? I love to
attach that pop top canvas : /
