Subject: Re: [T2] lifters?

If you end up going hydro, which I have just done. Mine was hydro before though. I would go with a dealer like web cam. (www.webcaminc_dot_com)  They have some really nice stuff that a lot of performance vw builders such as Jake Raby use. I got the 107i cam and match hardened lifters. I don't know what difference it is going to make but I will know soon. My engine that was being rebuilt by AVP will reach me today. So hopefully by next week it will be up and driving again!! :) I like hydro lifters personally and unless you are trying to build a high reving performance engine I don't think you'll be disappointed with them. I'm not saying anything bad about solids except I don't want to have to adjust them all the time. Also a company like web cam has overcome some of the design flaws VW had in there original hydro cam/lifters.  The 107i is for a TIV motor but if you have a TI, then I think they should have something for you too. Not sure which engine you are running. Hope this helps. Maybe just a little! :)
