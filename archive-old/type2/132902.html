Subject: Oil Cooler help

I'm sure it's been discussed a thousand times but what's the latest on
external oil coolers. I've got my engine out and figured that if I can I may
just as well install an external while I'm doing the rather half assed
(budget constraints) overhaul.

If anyone knows a decent procedure please fill me in.

I was also wondering if it would work to somehow directly force air over the
existing oil cooler or to, using larger intakes increase overall air
pressure and flow around the entire engine.

Thanks,

Giles
