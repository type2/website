Subject: Brazil AS41 case, no thermostat provision, Beetlemex

I just found / realized that the Beetlemex engine case, which is stamped as
a VW / Audi logo Brazil AS41 case... has no stud for the thermostat bracket.
Nor does it even have a hole to put a stud in...

Do Universal cases not come with these?

I presume you can have one added, is ther specifications as to where / how
to have it tapped?  Remember, I'm a complete novice -- so all details and
instructions appreciated.

P.S. I found one more good photo of the Hoover Bit that is a smaller size
graphic file.  http://www.i405_dot_com/vw/stand/Tin_HooverBit03.jpg
