&gt; &gt; I call it an engine compartment seal, part number 411 813 225, $19.95 on my

&gt; It MUST be put in after the engine is in, therefore, no you don't have
&gt; to take the engine out to put it in. It's a friction fit, and like Ron
&gt; says, it's kind of a bear to get in in some spots.
&gt; They come with one side porous and one side smooth. I've never figured
&gt; out which goes where, but just put the smooth side up to keep it from
&gt; absorbing oil that might blow out. Does anyone on the list really know
&gt; which is correct?

well I put one in with the Smooth side up and the porous side melted from
the exhaust heat in a few spots,
so the next one I put in Smooth side down, so far no melting

YMMV
