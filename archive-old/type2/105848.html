Subject: Re: [T2] mudflaps

Hi Volks,

Here's another mudflap idea:

Left: 2Slo
Right 2Bad

Q. Would you have to reverse the lettering to install these in the UK 
and Austrailia?

Happy trails,

&gt;&gt; BUT, and that's a BIG &quot;but&quot;, I won't be able to use the VW logo (for

&gt;&gt; obvious to all).
&gt;
&gt; Who'd want that anyway?  The logo of the huge corporation that sues
&gt; a woman for making hand painted mugs with a splittie (with a nose 
&gt; emblem)
&gt; on it.
&gt;
&gt;&gt; Several ideas for replacing the logo:
&gt;&gt;   1. A &quot;V&quot; in a circle on the left flap, and a &quot;W&quot; in a circle on the 
&gt;&gt; left
&gt;&gt; (My favorite, and I think that it's legal to use).
&gt;&gt;   2. Left: &quot;Bus&quot;, right: &quot;Freak&quot;
&gt;
&gt; How about something a bit more topical?
&gt; like Left: &quot;Back&quot;, right: &quot;Off&quot;
