Interesting .. I remember last year (when I was working in the parts biz), 
FadeFree started to slip new shoes in the supply chain for some part numbers .. 
maybe the supply of rebuildable cores started drying up?  I don't remember if 421 
(late Bus) and 503 (Vanagon) were showing up new at that point, but I did get a 
set of new-new 268s for my Fastback, and a set of rotors while I was at it.. 

Ah, the good old days .. when I could buy things from work at cost. =)
