&gt; im pretty sure this is a '66 Type 3 1500cc engine....

So its flat, not an upright?

&gt; either way, its obvious this is not a type 2 engine, despite how much the
&gt; PO insists on it.

71 and prior Buses used a lower compression version of the Type 1 engine.  72
and later air cooled buses used an engine based upon the Type 4 sedan series.
Technically, there has never been a &quot;Type 2&quot; engine until the waterboxer.

&gt; Im debating wether or not to put this is my '74 westy. There seems to be a
&gt; sudden shortage of pankakes in the area :)

Cooling will be a big problem.  Type 3's have a rubber boot sealing the fan
inlet to the cooling air inlet ducts.  Look inside of a type 3 engine bay some
time.  Get the owners permission first, I'd say.  Besides, a 1500 in a 74 bus
is sort of going backwards, isn't it.  The westy is pleanty heavy empty, you
know.

&gt; does anyone have experience with these

I restored a Squareback several years ago.  You could convert the Type 3
engine to an upright (type 1) configuration.  At a minimum, you would need to
change the oil cooler to the upright style, Generator stand, block off the oil
fill hole and add a dipstick tube, and you need all of the other type 1
pieces.  New universal cases can be built to either type 1 or type 3.

&gt; ..are most of the parts
&gt; interchageable with the '71 bus engine

This is going into a 74, right?  Even sealing a type 1 into a  72+ bus is
tough.  Cast your net a little further for an 1800 or 2.0L.

If type 1 is your only choice, maybe you could swap the type 3 for a complete
type 1, at least you'd have all the parts.

Where are you located, I'm in Northern California.

&gt; PLEASE PLEASE correct me if you know im wrong...

I won't say you're wrong.  It just seems the more difficult path.
