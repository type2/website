My 67 westy was a dead head bus, but other than the paint and stickers they
didn't screw it up to bad. mechanically restored it, cut new wood panels for
the rear and collected all the window rubber etc getting it ready for paint
but sold it to move out west. Any body in the Raleigh Durham NC area seen it
around? light blue and white 67 pop top with a huge Einstein head painted on
the drivers side. and the quote imagination is more important than
knowledge.  I lost touch with the owner and have been wondering where it
went.
