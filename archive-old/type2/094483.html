Subject: Re: [T2] Top Ten Things I LOVE about drivng my VW

When i was still in the TAC side of the air force we had a gen set 
called a dash eight.  We would take insulated safety gloves and  set 
metal coffee pots and canned foods on the exhaust port for very short 
periods of time.  BTW we had a butterbar find out why we put a couple 
holes in the lid of cans.

&gt; You don't need a stove, just put the pot on the engine for a while, and
&gt; you have some nice hot water.
&gt; Hrmmm, Might have to try to cook a cake back there on a long trip
&gt; sometime.
