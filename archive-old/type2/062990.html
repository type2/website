I always just pour 1/2 quart into the filter, install the filter, and pour
the other 3.5 quarts into the engine.  Never had a problem.  4.5 quarts
sounds like a problem, but maybe not enough to cause serious damage.  Are
you sure your dipstick is all the way in?  There could also be an alignment
problem with your fan housing which is causing your dipstick to not go in
all the way.  In any case, don't pour in more than 4 quarts when you change
the oil.
