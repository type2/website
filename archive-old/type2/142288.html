Subject: RE: [T2] One more question

I thought that was the stock tool, but I was not for sure. I don't think I
have one. I was thinking about putting the adapter through it and using it to
tighten with. Maybe pliers on the end might do the trick. I will have to look
through some of my boxes to make sure I don't have one.

I am hoping that my gauge is still good. It is a mac tool, so I am hoping that
it did not go bad. If not, then I will have to get a cheap one. Can't afford
mac stuff now.
