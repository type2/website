&gt; My oil temp sending unit is attached to a &quot;T&quot; fitting (as is the oil
&gt; pressure sender) and located where the aforementioned oil pressure
&gt; sender was located.

        That's not a good place to put a temp sender, it doesn't really get
any oil flowing past it. They are supposed to go down in the sump.
