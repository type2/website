&lt;&lt; ut if it is improperly adjusted/jetted, it may
 lead you to believe that it is overcarbed. BTDT... ask me how i know.
 	I believe that the dual-port Kadron sets that come from Gene Berg are
 all jetted for stock 1600cc motors. (that is, 130 main jets, 55 idle
 jets, 28mm venturis)... to start.  &gt;&gt;

i have been reading a few of the posts on the 400mm card problem....and some
of the responses.  if i were to sum it up in a sentence or two.....i would
recommend that whenever anything is changed beyond stock that other components
be adjusted or changed accordingly.  example:  you dont put bigger valves in
your heads unless you run a larger exhaust,  you dont add ratio rockers
without checking pushrod length or the ramp the cam operates on.  so when
using bigger carbs different dizzy,  yes it all can work as the stock
components did and many times better.......but it will take some adjustments
and definitely knowledge on how the whole motor works together.
