Subject: Re: [T2] Definitely a Friday topic

 I probably missed out on a lot of bus
&gt; related anthems. Can anyone recommend some songs that should be on the
&gt; mix?
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks,
&gt; Scott

There is the obvious 'Magic Bus'
'Land Down Under' by Men At Work mentions a 'fried out Kombi'.
Not a bus song, but Speech had a song called 'Super Beetle'
Ice Cube mentioned his Bug in a couple songs.

Thats all the VW related songs I can think of at the moment. But its your mix CD, put whatever feels good on the cd!

Eric
