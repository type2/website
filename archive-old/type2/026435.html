Dear All

I had noticed that the brake fluid level was going down for a couple of
weeks in my '71 camper. However, it only went down when the van was standing
unused (over a weekend for example) not when I was using it during the week.
The brakes felt fine so I topped up the reservoir every  few days and
carried on. The leak was very slight, perhaps in two to three weeks it would
have emptied the reservoir.

Anyway, I climbed under to find out what was wrong and discovered the union
between steel pipe and flexi hose behind the drivers side wheel was weeping.
A VERY slight touch with the spanners seems to have cured this.:-)

The question is, why did it only leak when the van was standing, surely the
pressure of brake use should have forced the liquid out ?

Before you ask, here is no brake booster on this van, I understand they were
either never fitted or only an option in the UK.

Any ideas on this ?

TIA

P.S. While I was under there noticed my Stainless Steel exhaust fitted 3+
month ago is still shinny !!! :-)
