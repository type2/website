Subject: Re: [T2] My Battery Fell Out...Help!!!!

Hi Charles,

If you find a bus with an intact battery tray around here you're better 
off driving it than making it a donor. But it doesn't happen often.

YMMV.

Happy trails,

&gt; If you have the money, time and love, the best thing to do is cut out 
&gt; the
&gt; cancer, find a donor bus and have a good body shop weld the piece in.  
&gt; Of
&gt; course, this all depends on the work you are willing to put in, the 
&gt; amount
&gt; of rust in the tray area and the condition of the rest of the bus.
