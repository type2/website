What is it lately with widnow regulators breaking?  I just replaced the one in my
drivers door, same problem as the original poster.  Had the old one out in 
about 10 minutes, got the new one in in about 15.  R&amp;R isn't that much of a 
PITA though, or at least wasn't in my opinion.

Remove door panel.  Remove regulator bolts -- two at the bottom, two at the top,
two at the knob for the handle.  Remove bolts connecting window to regulator, if
applicable (if it broke this won't be), and let window sit in the bottom of the door.  
Remove bolt at bottom of vent window frame.  Pull felt channel from top of 
window opening, remove upper vent window frame screw that hides underneath.  
Tilt back top of vent window, slide bottom of vent window frame forward a bit.
Remove regulator from door with some wiggling, wrangling and cursing.  
Installation is reverse of removal.

BusDepot has new regulators listed for about $20 each, but the one I installed
came from a '78 Weekender that a buddy has been parting out.
