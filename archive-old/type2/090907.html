not bad for just making it legal (in vw's eyes) to have enthusiasts
allowed to use TM's of VW

&gt; The part that really bothers me though is this part...

&gt; &quot;Licensee is also permitted to display images of Volkswagen Vehicles, 
&gt; provided those images were not taken from the official Volkswagen website, 
&gt; www.vw_dot_com, or other Volkswagen copyrighted documentation.&quot;
&gt; 
&gt; So, does this mean that I m not permitted to show pics of any of my
&gt; vw vehicles unless I sign this agreement?....I don't think so...I &quot;own&quot;
&gt; those cars, I don't license them from vw like software.  And should be 
&gt; able to display pics of them anywhere I want ....and give others 
&gt; permission to do the same.

Naturally IANAL, but I'm guessing this phrase is in there simply to
allow people to use images of VW's specifically while not allowing
taking the images from VW itself.[0] But one other problem w/ this is
what about old sales literature? Isn't this copyrighted? Would rob
have to take down his usefull &amp; (usually) humorous flyers from old VW?
This should be something they address. But like most legalese that
phrase could be turned around w/ a good forked tounge lawyer. :)


[0] I can understand that, it costs a lot for comercial artists &amp; web
designers.
