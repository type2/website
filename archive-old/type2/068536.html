&gt;totally stock rebuild, though I *am* putting in cam bearings
&gt;and having Gene Berg's shop balance it (please don't tell).

How much is Berg charging for a balance on the rotating parts?  Are you
doing the static balancing yourself?

&gt;As I start to think about the details, there is alot I do not know.
&gt;For example, what decals belong on the engine? Where are they placed?
&gt;Are the wire bails that hold on the valve covers painted or plain? 
&gt;You get the idea...
&gt;
&gt;What is a good source for this information? I see various books in the

Maybe a listmember who owns or has perused these can comment:  In the books
section of the RMMW catalog there's a two volume set of books that are
spiral bound and have a cheesy homemade cover (though they sell for $50
each) that are called &quot;History of VW&quot; or something like that.  I've heard
they are very detailed reference books for an OEM restoration.  Can anyone
comment (for Tom's sake--I'm not yet at that level of compulsion, but who
knows, someday...;) on their usefulness and if they give detailed
originality info for buses?
