&gt; here are links to pictures of the  parts I cannot find  
&gt; connections/descriptions for.
&gt;
&gt; picture one is a hose connection (where a hose SHOULD go) on the left  
&gt; side of the engine, on the plastic shroud, next to the coil.  where  
&gt; should this go?  no hose connected

That would connect to the charcoal canister that is used to collect  
fumes from the fuel tank.  You can see some additional details about  
these hook-ups here:

http://www.shagadelic_dot_org/photos/pod/liveframe.cgi/charcoal-canister- 
hose

These pictures are from a '76 2.0L with fuel injection, but you get the  
general idea.  If you don't have a charcoal canister, then I suggest  
you plug that hole by clamping a rubber cap over the nipple.

BTW, I would also suggest that you install an engine compartment seal;  
from this photo, it looks like yours is missing, and the seal is  
important for engine cooling.

&gt; picture two is the box on top of the engine.  Appears to be ?crankcase  
&gt; breather?  this should go to carb, correct?  blow by gas fume  
&gt; recollection?  there is a hose connection on it, but no hose.

Yah, that's the breather box.  Again, I have some pictures of this  
setup on a '76 2.0L with FI, taken when I fixed a vacuum leak resulting  
from a loose fitting on this hose:

http://www.shagadelic_dot_org/photos/pod/liveframe.cgi/throttle-boot-leak

I'm not sure exactly where the breather hose connects on a carbureted  
engine.  I see from the linkage in that photo that you have dual  
carburetors, in which case I couldn't even guess :-)

You'll need a molded hose for this.  For the fuel injected models, this  
hose is apparently NLA.  You'll see from my photos that I used a  
radiator hose of the approximate size that has a similar molded bend.   
It's not an oil-resistant hose, but the hose is cheap, and it'll work  
until I can find a correct replacement.

&gt; picture three is vacuum switch looking device, mounted to roof of  
&gt; engine compartment.  has electrical connection, and hose connection on  
&gt; rear (pictured), and hose connection on front.  very small hose, like  
&gt; 1/8&quot; inner diameter.

That one I can't help you with.

&gt; The charcoal canister has two large hoses coming from it, and one  
&gt; small hose.  The large hoses match the connection on picture 1 and  
&gt; picture two (left of engine fan shroud connection and crankcase  
&gt; breather connect), and also match a connection to the top of the  
&gt; aircleaner.  The small hose matches the size of the connection on the  
&gt; vacuum switch in picture 3.
&gt;
&gt; so, I have 3 places where large hoses should go (left of engine fan  
&gt; shroud pic 1, crank case breather pic 2, right side of charcoal  
&gt; canister) but only two hoses (one from left of charcoal canister, one  
&gt; from the carb on the right).  where does the last hose connection go?   
&gt; maybe a T connector?  I think pic 1 connector is pressure from fan.   
&gt; no vapor.  pic 2 would be crankcase pressure, with vapor.  should all  
&gt; go through canister, into carb?
&gt;
&gt; the small hose connector on the canister....maybe connect to the  
&gt; vacuum switch, but what would the point of this be?

The small hose on the canister usually connects to the fuel tank  
breather lines, to collect fumes.  Then, when the engine is running,  
the fan pushes air through the charcoal canister, which pushes the  
collected fumes into the air cleaner (the two large hoses).  On the FI  
models, a vacuum-actuated valve opens up in the air cleaner to let the  
fumes enter the air stream.

On dual carburetor setups, I don't know which air cleaner these  
connections hook up to, or if they hook up to both.  And if you don't  
have the stock air cleaners, I don't know if they'll hook up at all.
