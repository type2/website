Subject: Re: [T2]Blowby From Dipstick *(saga continues)

 From what you say, your breather is a strong candidate for the fault. 
Did you also check the fat hose for obstructions? The connection to 
into your carbs (don't know anything about carbs)?

Blowby is a normal condition in engines. That's why they all have 
breathers, to let that pressure out. Excessive blowby is a problem, but 
even norman engines provide enough blowby to blow oil out the dipstick 
tube if the breather is obstructed. It's got to get out somehow.
