Your biggest worry is not a plugged cooler, but a partially obstructed
cooler.  This will make the oil run hot.  

Unfortunately, the only way to test for a partial obstruction is to
set up a test bench with an oil pump and pressure sensors to measure
the flow at a set pressure and temperature.  Then you can compare new
and old coolers to see if the old is obstructed.

This isn't terribly practical, though I can think of a few bus volk
who would do this just for the technical challenge :)

If you can afford it, I'd go for a new cooler.  It'd be a shame if the
old cooler trashed your new engine.  There's a reason why the &quot;0 mile&quot;
engines come with a new oil cooler!
