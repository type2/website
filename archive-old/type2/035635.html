Subject: valve feeler gauge

Adjusting valves with my 1776 on the engine stand in the garage, as it is
at the moment, is a piece of cake. Doing so with the engine in the bus is
another thing entirely.  For  me, as with most people I guess, the most
time consuming part is switching back and forth among a set of feeler
gauges to hone in on the 0.004 one.

In a recent post, someone alluded to the use of a stepped feeler gauge.  If
one of these were available which spanned, say, the 0.002 -  0.006 range,
it sure would be a boon in my corner of the world.

Do these things exist? Available in a catalog?

Thanks, Jack
