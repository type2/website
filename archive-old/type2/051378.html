Subject: [T2] Mystery part - Week 2 - At 1800 EST (2300 UCT)

Volks,

Last week a number of different people suggested different times that
would allow them to be home and at a computer when I put up the &quot;mystery
part&quot; page.  Alas, thinking it over, I can think of no single time that
will be convenient to Austalia, North America, and Europe.  This week I am
going to try this 6:00 PM time which is convenient on the east coast of
North America, a bit early for lunch in Australia, and not-impossibly-late
in Europe. Next week, I'll try something different to give the
Californians a better chance :-)

And boy, do I have a wierdie for y'all :-) (nyahaha!)
