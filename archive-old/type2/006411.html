Has anybody tried to use any of the presses sold in Harbor Freight Tools 
for pressing ball joints?  A 20 ton is about $200 and I have friends who 
could also use if it works.  Tom  80 Westy

Tom,

yes I have.  These presses are more than strong enough to
do the job (I actually blew apart a stuck joint from a bug).
The biggest problem is that the VW torsion arms offer very
little bearing surface on the arms to rest securely on the press
plates.  It can be quite dangerous if the arm decides to pop
sideways while applying 12 tons of pressure!  The longest time
will be spent in making some type of jig arrangement (out of
various sized large pipe fittings, etc.) that will hold the torsion
arm secure in the press.  Oh to have all the special tools that
VW dealers got!  

Of course once you get to the Vanagon years, the ball joints
become far easier to replace. ;-)

Good luck!
