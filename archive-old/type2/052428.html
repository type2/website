the first thing is question wheather you actually got new heads, as all
the heads now ALL come with the threaded location for the sensor. it is
just blocked by the tin on the other side

&gt; etc.  The next step according to the manual was installing the cylinder
&gt; head temperature sending unit in the left cylinder head.  Upon
&gt; observation, the threaded hole for the CHT unit was located on the right
&gt; side of my engine.  This freaked me out and now Im wondering if it makes
&gt; a difference whether or not a head goes on one side or the other?  I

no 3 cyl normally runs a little hotter than the other three, so putting
the temp sensor there gives a little extra &quot;protection&quot; now wheather or
not it would be enough to throw off the FI is a good question.  my gut
feeling is &quot;I doubt it&quot; but I am sure Dr Tim or someone else who have the
specs memorized will tell you to change the head.

&gt; see that it would make a difference as the heads appear identical to me
&gt; other than the CHT mounting hole.  Please inform a newbie on what sounds

that's what puzzles me, all the recent heads (new) have the mounting hole
if for no other reason than they can both be machined identically and not
have to worry about a left or right.
