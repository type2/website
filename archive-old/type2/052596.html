We invite you all to come and participate in the St Patties Vintage VW Rally
on March 11th 2001.  The rally will begin at 10:00AM from Competition
Engineering in Tempe, AZ.  Price is low at only $5 per car and we will have a
special donations box set up at the end.

We are still looking for a few prize donations if anyone can help out.  The
rally will be an all day drive, it is LONG, so make sure to fill up the old
VW with gas before the event starts.  Winners will be determined by fastest
time with the most correct answers to the navigational questions.

In attendance helpng out will be the Arizona 4 Bangerz and German Addiction.
If anyone needs any more information please email me or visit the website
below in the events section.

Hope to see you there
