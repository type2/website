Subject: waving

All this talk of waving reminds me of the two fingered wave we do here in 
Minnesota.  If you stick your arm out of the window and wave your hand around 
you are most likely crazy or from the west coast, don't ya know ;-).  No, we've 
got the two finger.  Keep both hands on the wheel, where they belong, and use 
your left hand, the index and middle finger. You sweep those two fingers in a 
nice gentle arc without removing your palm from the wheel. It is a thing of 
beauty when properly done. 
  One time I was tooling down highway 9, half way betweem Ada and Borup in my 
old'65 beetle when I sow this group of hog Harley riders comin on.  I give the 
guys a two fingered wave a they go buy and the guy up front STANDS UP (kind of a
tricky thing to do at 70 mph)!  I couldn't believe it. He sticks one hand up in 
the air and gave me the straight palm to the front salute. I felt almost like I 
shook the Presidents hand. In my mind I can still see the guy roaring by.

Fun in an old beetle.  Fun yet to come in a '72 Westie
