Subject: Re: [T2] Bummed over emblem

Those $43 emblems are the small 73-79 size. My 72 takes this one:

241-853-601B  Chrome VW Emblem, 1968 to 1972   $83.55

Evay doesn't have any reasonably priced either. The $5 to $15 emblems
there are little ones for jetta, beetle, etc.

John

 I just checked this out, some of these are selling for as little as

 for OE stuff.  And there appear to be casters making the repros in
 metal.

&gt; What year are we talking about again?  73-79 emblem sells for $43 at
 Bus Boys.  I ordered one earlier this year.  It's chromed plastic, but
 Genuine VW (according to the part bag it came in, anyway).
