Subject: Push rod tub seals - uh oh.

Hey All,

So I spent the last hour and half removing and cleaning the push rod tubes
from my camper.   This is good.  The condition of the seals was bad.  The
outers were dry and hard.  The inners where sloppy wet and soft.

Here is the problem.  This week I got some seals.  The outers(large ones)
are green and fit just right, the old ones where red.  The inners (small
ones) are red and seem to be too narrow for the grove, the old ones fit
the grove perfectly and were black.

Do I have the wrong seals?

Thanks
