&gt;They have comparison data on which works better.  (Since they mainly sell

&gt;Basically, they say that relays work just as well as isolators at first,
&gt;until the contacts on the relays get burned or corroded.

That might happen, in say 50 years.  I'm still using my original one, which
I assume was installed in the bus in 1973.  Bus spent most of it's life in
California, near the beach.

&gt;They argue that's
&gt;why auto manufacturers went with breakerless ignition.

Slight difference here - the relay does not open and close millions of
times per year.

&gt;That true, but
&gt;here's a thought:  I live near the ocean so I get salty air.  I have to
&gt;periodically clean all my electrical connections like the fuse box, and I've
&gt;found it's easy to maintain relays by opening them up and cleaning the
&gt;contacts-just like points.  I don't use any silicone grease, like I do on
&gt;the spade connectors and fuses, but I polish them with 600 grit sand paper.
&gt;Works great.

The solenoid is sealed, isn't it?  I don't think it's possible to clean it,
except for the external contacts.

&gt;Anyway, this vendor sells &quot;smart relays&quot; which will not connect the primary
&gt;crank battery to the aux one if the crank battery voltage is below a certain
&gt;point, say 13 volts.  This prevents the aux battery from sucking the juice
&gt;out of the crank battery.

A neat trick, but not really necessary IMO.  I think I explained my
reasoning in a previous post.

&gt;and low voltage switches that will automatically disconnect specific loads,
&gt;like headlights, if the voltage drops to far.

That's nice... you're driving along at night with a dead alternator trying
to make it one more mile to your home, and all of a sudden at 50 mph your
lights go off!  But hey, it's better to protect the battery than to protect
the passengers!

&gt;Finally, they have an a
&gt;device which sounds an alarm when the voltage drops to low.

That would be great to wake up to in the middle of the night.

&gt;Although I have
&gt;dual batteries, I think a low voltage disconnect would be great for a Westy
&gt;with only one battery.  These devices sound cool, and I'm already trying to
&gt;see how I might use em.

Yes, it's a good idea, but not for the freakin headlights!!

Thanks for the info Alan, sorry I'm being so sarcastic.  :)  I just feel I
need to stand up for the relays since they are being unfairly slandered.
