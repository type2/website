Subject: RE: [T2] mattress

I am trying to figure out a way to make a custom size mattress
for a non VW...

I know you said a futon mattress wouldn't work, but another option I'd offer 
you is try to find a futon builder in your area and see what they have for 
raw materials.  The last futon mattress I had (which was five to six inches 
thick) was composed of varying layers of - not foam per say - but a kind of 
cloth-like padding.  These were in numerous different thicknesses and levels 
of firmness, so maybe something along those lines would provide you options 
in adding to any foam base you may go with.


Have a great day,

Chris
