Subject: Re: [T2] flame vs. heat switch

&gt; Guys, what exactly is the flame/heat switch? Are we talking about a sensing/detector type device?
&gt; 
&gt; yeah, no flame causes fuel to shut off.
&gt; 
&gt; The reason I asked is because someone suggested substituting a thermal (I assume meaning &quot;heat&quot;) switch in leiu of the flame switch. What I can tell you from doing fire protection for a living is that flame detectors are used in very sensitive situations (around generators/open flame) and are high speed detectors.
&gt; 
&gt; substituting a thermal switch (read: slower) may not be a good engineering decision when you're talking about personal safety with these heaters.

actually I think the heaters use a thermal switch, the flame switch would
be an upgrade to a more sensitive device, therefore in theory more safe
