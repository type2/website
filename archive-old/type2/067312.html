John, 

I am surprised that you don't know that the in a frictionless society the
ideal airfoil is a yin'yang :-)

OTOH, in the real world, it depends both on how much of a lift you want
and how much of a drag you are willing to be. Note that while a tear drop
will never give you a lift, it is always the path of least resistance.
Only by being asymetrical do you go anywhere but straight down. OTOH,
deviation from the norm is also a drag and the further from the norm you
deviate, the more of a drag you become.  That said, drag is also very much
a factor of the speed you want to go.  A motto I, as a VW driver, have
take to heart is &quot;make haste, slowly&quot;.  The more you push a bus, the
greater the resistance.  I regard my bus as a perfect vehicle in part
*because* the harder I push it, the greater its resistance. 

Of course, angle of attack is also a critical factor and one that must be
finely calculated.  Indeed, I believe that the engineers at VW knew that
as busses aged and breakdowns became more frequent that the owners would
need a greater lift to compensate, thus the designed-in rear end sag to
give the bus a greater angle of attack, and the driver a greater lift
while driving.  Alas, at a certain point, the bottom falls out and the bus
becomes a total drag without major work.

Golf balls, BTW, have dimples because ancient Scots discovered the older,
more beat-up, dinged, and dimpled golf balls went further than brand-new,
shiny smooth golf balls (Is there anyone out there still wondering how I
am going to relate this to air-cooled VW's? :-).  As a result, the market
for used, banged-up golf balls soared.  Knowledgeable golfers began to
hunt far and wide for the older, banged-about balls, in preference to the
newer brighter, shinier, but less distance-covering balls.  Golf *ball*
manufacturers (unlike certain Golf manufacturers I could name) took note
of the popularity of the older balls and decided, &quot;Why, we could make them
just like people want them.&quot; And, indeed, they are all made that way to
this day. 

At this point, H adjourned to the basement to fetch his shovel and start
to dig himself out of the waist deep pile of *very stinky* aeronautical
and other puns that had piled up about his computer. (but that's par for
the course :-)
