&gt; Finally, if a piece of debris gets into my fan blades where does it
&gt; end up? (Missing 2 fan blades, planning on buying grated protector but
&gt; again, failing the mind-meld with bentley.
&gt;
In general got to watch for items getting into the cooling area. Just
inherited a free Type 4 core that burnt up because someone dropped a spark
plug that lodged between cylinders 3 and 4, causing the cylinders to receive
insufficient cooling air between them.

&gt; I've heard of some kind
&gt; of cold start adjustment that I may be able to do to
&gt; the fuel system, but I need some details. The starter
&gt; cranks and cranks and cranks and some times I get a
&gt; little put-put from the muffler like it really wants
&gt; to start, but no go. Any advice you might have with
&gt; getting this baby to fire when it's cold sure would be
&gt; a great help.

I don't know of any adjustment. When mine did this, the wire connector had
come off the cold start valve. You've either got a problem with the cold
start valve, thermal time switch, or temp sensor. Until you can trouble
shoot it, I was able to just squirt a shot of carb cleaner into the air
distribution plenum to compensate before starting.
&gt;
&gt; i just adjusted my valves (~500 miles since rebuild). The Bentley said
that for hydraulic valve lifters...all you need do is adjust them for zero
clearance and then 2 more turns clockwise and then lock them down with the
nut. Is this right? Tighten them? sounds odd to me. I have not driven it
since adjustment...just moved the van to another spot. Sounded noisy and
then quieted down some. I don;t think it is as quiet as it was after the
rebuild. Anyone have any experience with this?

Most recommend this be changed to only 1 more turn clockwise to allow more
valve
contact with the seat to avoid burnt valves.

&gt; I am currently in dispute with my insurer about the
&gt; value of my 1970 Westie. It is free of all structural
&gt; rust with a recon engine and is 3/4 way through a resto.
&gt; They say its worth 700 pounds and therefor not worth
&gt; repairing. Can you provide any Ad's or documentation
&gt; supporting the uniqueness of the 1970 T2. I have asked
&gt; them to find 1970's for the price and they cannot but
&gt; will not accept that this is due to the rarity of this
&gt; years model etc.
&gt;
Do a completed auctions search on ebay. 700 pounds is surely less than
$1500. Bay window westies in good shape do a minimum of $3500, often much
more.
