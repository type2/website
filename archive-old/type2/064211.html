Subject: few busses sighted at pot fest

Boston - Sept 21, 1996

      Since I only live a few blocks from the Boston Common, I decided
to walk down there and listen to the music at the legalize pot rally (No
I didn't smoke any).  People everywhere about 50,000 and just about all
smoking, The news said only three arrests.  Listened to a few bands (to
many people to see a thing) and just mulled around.  Figured that I
would have to see a least one bus. Saw three. The first was a newly and
somewhat badly painted 71 with babyish blue on the bottem and white on
the top, the interior was not in very good shape. The third was a 68
westy, dark blue and white, the interior was in good shape with all the
westy parts and the exterior had afew dings.  The third was a 66 deluxe
from arizona. Primer grey with no rust or dents, had a roof rack and
jail bars.  evrything looked kind of dirty.  It was for sale at 3000 and
instruction where to leave a note on the bus. To bad I don't have some
cash.  I was wishing my westy was running so I could drive into the
crowd and hang with all the pot heads.
