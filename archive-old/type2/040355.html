&gt;  It idles real rich
&gt; and lacks power under accelleration

Check the cylinder head temp sensor. Loosen it and retighten it. You may
have a poor ground circuit connection thru the threads due to corrosion.


&gt;
&gt; 1.) Compression measured cold was 135 psi all around. I assume this is
&gt; good?

Yes.

&gt; 2. Fuel pressure is 37 PSI with the vacuum line disconnected at idle
&gt; and 39 with it connected! (this appears to be way too high!)  The
&gt; manual says 28 and 35 and I'm getting 37/39! This would surely make it
&gt; run rich wouldn't it!

How accurate is your gauge??

&gt;
&gt; I assume I should plan to replace the fuel regulator... ?
&gt; One of the plugs appears clogged and causes the plug not to fire.(need
&gt; new plugs!)
&gt; 3. The centrifical advance seems off. With the vacuum line disconnected
&gt; it hits the 7.5 BTDC spec at 950RPM... OK
&gt; At 1600 RPM with the vacuum disconnected the timing goes to 20 BTDC.
&gt; The manual indicates 9-14 degrees (BTDC or advanced from idle 7.5
&gt; degrees BTDC?).

This is correct. You neglected to subtract the initial advance of 7 1/2
which would put it at 13 1/2.

&gt; At 3400 RPM the timing shows 28 BTDC. The manual says it should be
&gt; 21-25 degrees at 3400 RPM.

Don't include the initial timing!
Set your timing at zero and then do your advance tests. You will find them
right on spec.

&gt; With the vacuum reconnected the timing is 20 BTDC _at_ 1600 RPM and 36 _at_
&gt; 2000 RPM and 36BTDC. It tops out at 2200 RPM where it is 36 BTDC at
&gt; 2200 RPM.
&gt;
&gt; Isn't this way too high?

No, when you add up all the advances together you will find it runs around
43 total. Usually the timing mark will be at the O of VOR, past the number
marks! This is the way it is designed. If it was a upright 1600, yes that is
too much. But not for a type4 engine.
This is one reason why a 009 is not a good choice for these engines = not
enough advance.


&gt; The bus has very little power when I hit the accellerator. Could my
&gt; power problem be caused by too much advance?

No.
Check your cylinder head temp sensor. An overrich engine will lack power.
