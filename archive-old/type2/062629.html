Subject: New smog laws in CA?

On the way into work this morning, I listened to a talk show that had as 
it's subject the new &quot;Smog II&quot; regulations that will be put in place 
shortly (if not already). I only got about 10 minutes into the show 
before getting to work, but the basic ideas I heard were:

1) Cars previous to 1975 (pre catalytic converters) would have a more 
difficult time passing the bi-annual smog check. 

2) Smog check prices would go up, and the information taken during a 
standard smog check would be sent directly to Sacramento. 

3) There would be road side &quot;spot&quot; emission testing.

One of the guests on the show (guy from Air Resources Board) intimated 
that the areas they would be focusing on strongest were the 
Davis/Sacto/Stockton areas.

Has anyone heard any more on this? Does anyone know of a centralized 
source for more information?
