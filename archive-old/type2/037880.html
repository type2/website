Subject: crossover pipe

Hello all

  New to the list, and gaining knowledge from here everyday.
My question: I have a 79 Calif. bus with the cat. converter next to
the drivers side heat exchanger. My crossover pipe is rusted through
and in two pieces. At the moment, cost to replace prohibits me from
replacing this and my whole exhaust. I need a good temporary( 3-4 months)
fix to keep me in good humor with my neighbors. Has anyone welded these
together with any luck? I have a friend with a wire feed welder, just not sure
what to use, or if even to bother.
   Thanks in advance!

   Kelly
   79 Bus
