Subject: Bob Hoover Sermons CD-ROM -- Update

I had promised to have the Sermons CD ready November 1 but I didn't make
it, I badly misjudged the amount of work it would require. My own fault.

I want this to be the best possible resource, so I went back to the
beginning and read everything Hoover ever posted to the vanagon, type2 and
vintagebus lists and grabbed everything that was rich but never made it
into the now-defunct Sermons web archive. This swelled the size of the
thing by ~30%.

Then there is whipping it into shape as a good PDF file, using Pagemaker
6.5, a buggy, clumsy, slow program about which I have nothing good to say.
=^ )

To give you some idea, the Sermons file stands at 630 pages and I figure
I'm around 80% finished. Yeah. Bob has posted a lot of good stuff over the
years.

We have beta testers lined up and I have an appointment to burn trial CDs
on Sunday, we should roll out the real deal early next week.

If anybody knows a decent secure credit-card server please send me pmail.
It looks like digitalriver flaked out.

Whenever I talk about this on the vintagvw list people ask &quot;how much?&quot;, but
commercial advertising is not allowed on that list, and it looks to me like
saying the price is crossing the line into cardinal sin. It'll be enough to
vote but not quite enough to buy beer, right? Good. =^ )
