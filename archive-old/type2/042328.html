Subject: part 4 High oil pressure (fixed) 

Volks- a big thank you to Mike G for his help.  He said, &quot; I know for a
fact that if the gauge wire shorts out it will peg the gauge to the high
side.&quot; Once I read that, I re-thought about how I wired the gauge and I
realized where I had made my mistake. First of all, I want to say that
they don't call it an &quot;Idiot Light&quot; for nothing, and in my case, it is
aptly titled.  When I went to hook up the wire from the new sender to the
gauge, I figured that instead of run a new wire all the way down the bus,
just use an existing wire- the wire that went on the old &quot;idiot sender&quot;.
I tapped into the wire at the front of the bus and ran it a foot or so to
my new gauge. What I DIDN'T do was UNHOOK the wire from the idiot light.
	 I was looking at how an idiot light and sender work, and it's
pretty simple. Current is SENT from the light to the sender, and there is
a small spring loaded plate in the sender that opens and closes the
circuit, causing the light to go on and off. When the engine is not
running, there is no oil pressure pushing on the little plate, allowing
the little plate to ground itself on the engine block (that's why they
say not to use teflon tape when you screw in the sender) and it completes
the circuit and turns on the light. The light goes out once the oil
pressure is high enough to push that plate up, opening the circuit.
Anyway, by leaving the wire attached to the oil light, I was actually
grounding out the sender, causing it to bury itself all the way to the
right, just like Mike said it would. 
	I took the wire off, wrapped some electrical tape around it and
started up the bus. 60psi with the engine cold.  My valves need to be
adjusted, so I didn't keep the engine running to warm it up. But it
works! Thanks list.
