Subject: Re: Reliability of Busses (sic)

american english has an independence from.....english.  We have a living
+AD4-language, it changes.  to me +ACI-buses+ACI- should be pronounced +ACI-byoozez.+ACI-   not
+AD4AIg-busses.+ACI-  I vote for +ACI-busses.+ACI-  no offense to our cousins over there, but
+AD4-I'm american, not english.  Anybody can spell anything anyway they want to
at
+AD4-anytime they so desire,  okay? from now on?
+AD4-Mike (mike+ACY-merry)


Fine by me. If you look at the way things have evolved, many of what we call
American spellings were quite normal in Britain in the 19th century. We've
altered stuff as much as you have. The Oxford Dictionary, which is probably
the most authoritative work used in Britain, usually allows both British and
American spellings.

OK I guess I might just get this in before this thread is snipped.
