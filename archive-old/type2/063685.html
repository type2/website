Subject: Re: Help with replacing Westy top in 68...

 
Thanks for all the excellent advice on my poptop canvas.

I've pretty much decided I'm going to take the top off with the canvas 
still attached at the top. There's a new poptop seal on the way, and if I 
take the whole top off I can give everything a good scrub and have it on 
sawhorses, which will make the canvas work and the new seal work a lot 
easier.

I also have to fabricate one of the legs of one of the X-braces in the 
front, it's broken. Doesn't look too tough--which undoubtedly means I'll 
be back here whining for help shortly because I can't figure it out. ;)

I still need the frontmost tin piece (firewall tin) for a 68 if anybody 
will sell it to me. DON'T MAKE ME USE THE RIVET GUN.
