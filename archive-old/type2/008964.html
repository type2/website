&gt; We took the wheel off.  Then, there was a giant nut with a pin

&gt; this we discovered that the part that the nut screws on to was 
&gt; stripped.  Not the nut itself, but the part it screws on to.  My 
&gt; father said it is called the &quot;Rear Outer Axle Shaft&quot;, but the local
VW 
&gt; shop acts like they have no idea what that is when I mention it.  Or, 
&gt; they say that it isn't possible for that to happen.  But, I saw it, I 
&gt; know it is stripped.
&gt; 
&gt; So we need to replace it.  What my father does not know is how 
&gt; difficult this is to remove and replace.  Is this something that my 
&gt; father and I can do at home?  Or should it be done in a shop?  Keep
in 
&gt; mind my father is good with cars in general.  He figures that as long 
&gt; as no special equipment is needed he should be able to do it.

Only special tool you need is a 12-point triple square socket for the
CV joint bolts.  Once the CV is out of the way the stub axle should
push out of the bearings.  Shouldn't be too hard to find a
replacement.  Check the bearings and CVs while you are in there.
