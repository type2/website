Subject: RE: [T2] new starter and still no start!

If the spark plugs are out, it should have fairly consistent resistance.
Sounds like the maybe pressure plate or clutch disk...I think the flywheels
are pretty bullet-proof in a T4.

Since it turns now, you might try installing the starter, cranking with the
plugs out, and working the clutch (full travel) a few times while cranking.
Maybe that would help to seat things evenly? Charge the battery first.

I assume the fan and alternator are not rubbing or binding?

&gt;If you can't turn it by hand, don't use the starter...you'll burn it out.
&gt;You need to figure out why it's not turning freely. Forget about starters
&gt;and points; nothing electrical could cause the engine itself to jam. You
&gt;need to get the engine to the point where you can turn it by hand (with a
&gt;wrench on the alternator bolt):
&gt;
&gt;1) Make sure it's in neutral
&gt;2) Did you actually try turning the engine with the starter removed?
&gt;3) Did you by chance try turning the engine _after_ you bolted the tranny
&gt;on? Maybe there was some kind of clutch issue?
&gt;
&gt;You could try loosening the bolts that hold the tranny &amp; engine together,
&gt;pry them apart a little, wiggle, then retorque.
&gt;
&gt;If all that fails, maybe you need to drop the engine, take off the tranny
&gt;and check out the clutch. Did you put the pressure plate in the right way?
&gt;(I don't know if that would cause binding?)
&gt;
&gt;Worst case, some bolt or tool got into maybe an intake valve or the case
and
&gt;has jammed. save this for last, Unless you're unexplicably missing a small
&gt;tool :O(
