I don't know what to say Kevin. I have ordered from Dawn twice. She is
really swell people and does really good work. The craftsmanship on
the bra she made for our 62 is beautiful. Yes, slow is a word that
describes her too. This is a common topic on the samba too. I'm sorry
she isn't responding to your mails, but I think a little patience will
pay off. Bear in mind she was most likely at the Seattle Vintage show
last week, so she is probably still away from her business at the
moment.

 I expected a waiting period but was told 4 weeks not 8?? AfAik her
 accident was in 2003 on the way home from the classic. Actually none of
 it would matter if I could get a response from her with an eta.
