    If you have the engine completely apart and are looking for a long smooth
running engine I would suggest doing a complete rebuild. As long as you have it
apart, might as well. 
    If you don't like the shop, don't work with them. If someone is looking for
your business and then treats you like a jerk than they don't deserve your
money. DO NOT TAKE YOUR ENGINE TO SOMEONE JUST BECAUSE THEY ARE CLOSE TO YOUR
HOUSE! Shop around and find someone who you feel comfortable with. 
    When I rebuilt my engine we took almost everything to the machine shop to
have it checked, balanced, bead blasted, ground, smoothed and polished. We took
the pistons, rings, heads, the case, push rods, pulley, flywheel, cluch plate,
lifters, crank shaft, even the  push rod tubes. I might have even missed
something in my list. 
    Why did we take all that? Because I trust my machine shop's owner's
knowledge and I trust that he wouldn't scam me. He should know what he's talking
about, he used to work with Gene Berg and now races Ghias. He machined my
brother's 1600cc engine into a 1835cc monster and it runs like a champ. He
checked all my parts, told me what to didn't need work and what did, and didn't
force me to buy parts from him. I did just cause I didn't mind giving him my
business. 
    When it was all done he gave me back my old, now clean parts and the new
ones I bought from him and my dad and I rebuilt my bus engine back to the
original 1500cc specs and I couldn't be happier with it. The only actual
building the machine shop did was adjust the end-play when it was all put
together. 
    Do the entire engine. It may cost you some cash but it all pays off when you
drive down the road and heads turn because your engine's so quiet, not blowing
smoke.

I called my local machine shop to inquire about the price of grinding and 
perhaps balancing my crank. I've read Bob Hoover's sermons on balancing and 
know enough to say I want the entire reciprocating deal balanced as a 
unit--crank, pulley, flywheel, pressure plate, etc.

So the guy (a jerk, by the way..is this endemic to people who work in 
machine shops? he asked, donning flameproof suit) says I'm now looking at 
having an ASSEMBLY balanced, and that the price goes up accordingly. Not 
only must I balance the aforementioned parts, but I've got to bring him the 
connecting rods, bearings, pistons, rings, etc. ad nauseum. Why must I bring 
these parts, I ask, if they are not going to be actually ATTACHED to the 
crank at the time of balancing? Why can't I get the rods balanced as a set, 
the pistons balanced as a set, the crank as a unit, etc. He tells me, and I 
quote, &quot;We have to know the weight of the rods, bearings, pistons, rings&quot; 
blah, blah, blah.

This makes no sense to me. So I've brought the matter to the All Wise and 
Knowing List. This ain't gonna be no racin' engine, I just want it to run 
long and smooooooth. I don't want some fast-talkin' machine dude building me 
a formula vee engine or something of the sort.
