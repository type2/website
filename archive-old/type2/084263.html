Subject: Oil pressure relief parts mixup?

I am having a low oil pressure problem on my newly rebuilt 78 2000
engine. This engine replaced the 75 1800 that was in originally. I am
confident that are internal clearances are right on. Unfortunately I
didn't have correct tools to measure clearances in the oil pump. When
the engine is first started it has aprox. 60 psi. when oil temps reach
180 measured at the sump, the pressure is down to about 25. It seems to
vary a little. Hot idle oil pressure is about 15 to 18. I have about 90
miles on the engine now and don't drive it much yet.

Today I pulled the pressure relief spring and piston hoping to find it
stuck or a weak spring. The piston moves freely in the bore and the
spring exerts 24 Lbs on the bathroom scale when it's compressed to 1
1/16 inch. I am confused, Bentley says I should have 3.8 to 4.4 lbs.
(Ref table a, chapter 5, pg30) Is this a misprint? Should it read 38 to
44 Lbs? If so I have a weak spring!

I pulled out the plunger and spring from the 1800 and found another
mystery. According to parts manual, I thought the 1800 and 2000 used the
same relief piston and spring. The piston from the 75 is .084&quot; longer
than the piston that I put in the 2000. The spring is .340&quot; shorter than
the one I out in the 2000. The spring is 4 Lbs weaker than the one in
the 2000 when compressed a like amount.

Questions: 1. Is this oil pressure ok, seems low to me?
                 2. If I use the longer piston and the longer spring
should I see an improvement in the pressure? I'm beginning to wonder if
I mixed up the springs and plungers.
                3. If I order a new spring and piston from someone, what
are the correct part numbers for a 78 2000 engine?
                4. Is there anything else I should consider before
deciding to replace the oil pump? AAAAARG!

The Turtlebus Lives again but I'm worried about her heart :(
