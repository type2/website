Subject: Non Bentley manual?

Hi

I was looking in the archives with a view to fitting manual choke set-up
(lots of questions few replies) and came up with some indication that
another &quot;official&quot; manual apart from Bentley might exist. i.e. a German one
(to be expected) and an English(as in UK) one.  This was from way back in
the last century (1995).

Can anyone add to this? is there an official non-Bentley manual, does anyone
know any details?

Thanks
