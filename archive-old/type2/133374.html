&gt; How tight should I do the new clamps?

different types of clamps need different levels of snuggness, general rule
of thumb, the better the clamp the less tight it needs to be pulled and
the less likely to fail if pulled tight

in other words use good clamps
 &gt;
&gt; So they are visibly pinched or just screwdriver snug????

so they don't leak  &lt;g&gt;
