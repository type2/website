Hello Ted,
          Do I read paragraph 1 correctly, that checks should be made payable 
to _at_Lasta_dot_net?  What if an individual contribution is less than 150??  

I snailmailed a small contribution to you several months ago, and the check 
(payable to Type2...) doesn't appear to have been cashed to date.  Thanks for 
your help!

Glenn

Hi Volks- the treasurer here. It is time for a fundraising drive for the
Type2/Vintagebus mailing lists. We have 4 months of operating funds left
($659.00 ) in the bank. Our finances are very simple. Bandwidth is $150.00
per month (payable to _at_Lasta. Net) and bank charges of $12.00 per month...

..if you want to send a check, please send to:

Type2 Fundraiser
C/O Ted Finesman
