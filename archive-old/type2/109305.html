&gt; We got a visit from someone from the Trading Spaces TV show. Apparantly,
&gt; they now have a kids' spin-off airing Saturday mornings, where they
&gt; make-over kids rooms. One of the upcoming episodes (supposedly within a
&gt; few weeks, according to the person who came by) will feature a room
&gt; decorated in a VW Bus motiff. They picked up about $500 worth of parts
&gt; for the project.  If anyone hears anything about when it will air (or
&gt; happens to tape it!), let me know!
