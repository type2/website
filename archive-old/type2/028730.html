Hey,

I'm planning a trip soon to Wilmington, NC from Memphis, TN. If anyone
I-40ish would be willing to offer up driveway space along the journey,
please drop me a p-mail.

I'm also looking for a driver's door handle for my '72, if you know of cheap
parts along the route.

As an added bonus, I'm a fair-to-middlin' bus mechanic, so if you got a
problem you haven't figured out and you're on my route, I could try to stop
by for a look. I'm usually a fairly driven traveler, but I don't really have
to be.

Thanks! Joe
