Subject: RE: [T2] silver looking tank in engine compartment on new bus -
  id

Sounds like a gasoline aux heater.
 Metal tag says BN4 on it somewhere?



It's on the left hand side of the 74 westie deluxe.

Round silver propane looking tank... what on earth is it.
It has a propane tank under the van behind the passenger
side wheel... I can't figure it out. Haven't really looked at it hard
but any ideas?
