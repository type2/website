&gt;I saw a message you had posted on the web asking for help for your friend
&gt;from any diesel vanagon owners. I am also looking at either a diesel vanagon
&gt;or a diesel vanagon camper and i was wondering if you had gotten any
&gt;addresses from people who had advice to give on them... if so, it would be a
&gt;REALLY big help if you could either forward their addresses to me or just
&gt;pass on anything important they recommended...
&gt;
&gt;Thanks a lot!
