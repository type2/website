Subject: Broken Brakes

	I blew a rear wheel cylinder last Thursday but I wasn't that mad 
since I  have had new E-brake cables that have been waiting for two weeks to
be installed.  I figured now was a perfect time to renew my whole brake
system.  So after taking my wheels off, and then the drums I see that my
shoes are wearing on only about a third of their surface.  It seems my
adjusters have been rusted in place for some time.  I was able to free up
one side but the other needs a torch or maybe drilling out.  New star
adjusters are on the way.
	So now I am going to tackle the E-brake.  Both manuals show the
cable going throug the backing plate and being held in place with a clip.
Only mine seem to have rusted togother and become one.  I chip and scrape
and pull but I am afraid of destroying the backing plate.  Any ideas as
how to approach this fix?  I would really like to get my E-brake working
properly.  New backing plates are not avialable and used one are not that
easy to come by.  Thanks in advance for any and all replies.
