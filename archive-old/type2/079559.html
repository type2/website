Subject: Re: [T2] clutch and flywheel off

correction:
1st paragraph, 3rd sentance from last &quot;I was going to leave the flywheel
ON, but I'm glad I didn't....&quot;

&gt; So, I was playing around with the engine stand mount and finally decided
&gt; (with the help of list member's suggestions) that I would have to take
&gt; the clutch off to safely attach the stand mount.  So, I got the clutch
&gt; off pretty easily, but MAN are those flywheel nuts tight!!!  I used the
&gt; idea in the Muir book but used a pair of plyers around a bolt through
&gt; the engine mount and into the teeth of the flywheell while I used my
&gt; wrench to undo the bolts.  I was going to leave the flywheel off, but
&gt; I'm glad I didn't because I wouldn't want to inadvertantly scratch the
&gt; innards or get any oil inside there.  That'd prolly be bad ;)
&gt; 
&gt; Tomorrow, engine goes on the mount and I'm pullin' all the FI and tin
&gt; off.  If I have time I'll try and get the exhaust off too.  I'm very
&gt; anxious to get to that cylinder #4 to find out why I lost compression!
&gt; 
&gt; I'm also excited to take all my tin and cooling shroud to the spray
&gt; booth to make it all nice and shiny.. don't know what colors yet..
&gt; hmm....
&gt; 
&gt; later all!
