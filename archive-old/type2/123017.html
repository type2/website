Subject: Minor problems 

Problem 1: Cheapo car alarm keeps going off every time I slow down and
sometimes when I turn.
Solution: When I took the inline fuse out (to try and identify the cause of
a voltage drain), I put the fuseholder back together . Over time the bottom
wire had worked its way in and very so often touched the top contact and
initialised the alarm. Replace fuse with roll of insulation tape and all is
well.

Problem 2: Can't get above 68mph on motorway while running in new engine.
Solution: Stupid modern Golf in front needs to get out of the way !!!!!!!
(OK, I'm showing off, the Remtech engine is running in nicely now after
around 150 miles. Sounds like a sewing machine in the back instead of a
tractor. This was the first motorway trip. I'd hoped on a Sunday the road
would be quiet so I could hit the magic 70. Nope, slower car in front and
not enough time before the turnoff to overtake. :-( Can't these people in
thier slow cars keep off the roads when people like us with our superior
machinary are trying to drive :-P )
