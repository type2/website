    The other day at the VW show someone must of tried to take the cap of my
water filler for the sink and must of tightened it too much as they broke
the tube that goes down into the cabinet.  Any hints on what to do to fix.
Do I need to get the whole cabinet or does someone know much about getting
the tank out or is there a quick fix.  Looks like S#(T with the broken tube
just sticking out of the stainless steel
