First, get copies of the type 2 official VW service manuals for your model, 
about $35,  and get a copy of how to keep your VW alive.. about $20. From 
The Parts Place or Amizon_dot_com.

Study the books while living totally in your bus for at least two weeks 
before you get very far from home base. You will discover what you have and 
what you don't have. Take some woolen underwear to deal with unexpected 
cold spells across the northern states. Sometimes it snows at high altitude 
in the passes. And have some rain gear.  Cook as little as possible inside 
the bus, especially fried things that make greasy smoke/vapors. (Cook 
outside the bus, on portable propane equipment.)

You might want to make insect screens for the windows, and use strings of 
flat refrigerator magnets to hold them in place against the window frames. 
You of course have a screen for the rear hatch. And we carry a few gallons 
of distilled water for drinking. Secure the loose stuff in the cabin, so it 
doesn't crash forward in an emergency stop. Carry a few folding chairs, a 
small folding table, a fishing lantern, and have some kind of fly with 
poles and tiedowns and stakes, to use as an awning. And several good 
flashlights. And maybe a baseball bat.

Don't even think about a cross country trip unless you already have the 
correct tires at the proper pressure. Hard to find right tires on the road. 
Fix your exhaust system so it lasts the whole trip. Not every town can deal 
with a 1974 VW Bus exhaust system failure. Make sure the brakes are in very 
good shape, and see that the steering box won't break and your front beam 
is solid....they tend to have internal rust. Put on some new wiper blades.

Others who travel for extended periods carry some spare parts for their 
vehicle, and enough money to get put up at a motel for a week, and towed 
and fixed at least once....maybe $500. Might throw in another $500 to take 
care of medical emergencies. I carry metal foil-faced duct tape to seal up 
unexpected openings, such as windows that won't roll up, or holes in glass 
or chassis or tent. And I carry blocks and boards to level the bus, when I 
have to camp on uneven surfaces.

&gt;Subject: re: wife and I cruising america quit our jobs ? a place to 
&gt;stay?!!!!!!!!!!
&gt;
&gt;My wife and I (Julie and TJ) are traveling for a bit!!
&gt;
&gt;We were unable to take our honey moon when we got married 3 years ago
&gt;(because a jerk hit us off of our motorcycle 20 days before we got married)
&gt;so, we have quit our jobs and are traveling (tj is going to finish a
&gt;graduate degree in philosophy at the end of June, 2002!!!
&gt;
&gt;we are starting in Charlotte, NC on July 15th, 2002 and traveling north
&gt;hopefully all the way to New Foundland and then we will head west through
&gt;the states.
&gt;
&gt;We need to know what will be the best to see and we need places to stay (so
&gt;we don't ruin our budget).
&gt;
&gt;we are mid 20's -- quiet and are excited to meet new people and more of
&gt;America -- and grapple with more and new ideas!!!
&gt;
&gt;I am going to try to log our trip on a website I have reserved as
&gt;discontnenment_dot_com
&gt;
&gt;we will be in our 74 westy fully self contained minus a toilet and
&gt;shower?????!!!!!
&gt;
&gt;ANY suggestions on places to stay, people to meet, things we should do to
&gt;our bus (we are neophites -- so nothing is too basic), things we should take
&gt;with us!!
&gt;
&gt;thanks so much for all of your ideas!!!
&gt;
&gt;Julie and TJ
