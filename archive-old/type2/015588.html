This came to me by p-mail from &quot;THE SCHMIDTS&quot; &lt;SCHMIDT7_at_CORE.COM&gt;. Respond
to them or the list, not to me. Thanks,

The Bentley does show the color codes. Get a hand glass. That's what I use
for wiring diagrams. If the stock starter had two small terminals and the
&quot;New&quot; candidate does not, it is not the right starter. I would send it back
with a simple explanation. I don't care what their catalog says.

Otherwise, get a spade adapter and hook them both to the one tab and see
what happens.

&gt;Hey Doc,
&gt;    T2 list won't take my post today.  Could you foreward this for me or
&gt;even help with an answer?  Thanks a million!  Jay
&gt;Can someone help?  I have in hand a NEW, non-rebuilt bosch starter for my
&gt;'77.  There is only one spade-type connecter on it...#50.  I have 2 wires
&gt;that went to 2 different spades on the old one.  Bentley says not to get
&gt;#30 and #50 wires reversed.  How to do this if there is no #30, just a #50?
&gt;    BD verified that they sent the correct starter, but they didn't know how
&gt;the
&gt;wires went.
&gt;Bentley seems to say that one of the wires is for ignition, one is for the
&gt;FI (fuel pump) (via the main relay I believe.).
&gt;Any help appreciated!
&gt;Jay
&gt;PS: Who knows what my wiring diagram says: I still can't decipher one :(
