Subject: Re: Re: [T2] 74 Rust Free Bus in CA for $80?

Hmm, that's really interesting. I wonder if some states are more lieniant than others? In this particular case, the Fiero I purchased (parts car) still had a clean title, but it had not been registered in like 5 years. It was registered to someone up in Lake Worth, Florida. The Fiero was not reported stolen either. I purchased it from a guy who said that he had purchased it from an auction. He had purchased it for his son to fix up his other Fiero. He took the nose and rear bumper off and left everything else alone. Being that Fieros aren't particularly collectible or sought-after, I tend to believe it. I emailed the DMV and they stated that I needed to send the original owner a letter and ask him to sign a form and mail it back to me. With all the projects I've got on the house, and my Bus being 90% complete, I figured it's best if I just strip it and take the parts. :\

&gt; 
&gt; OTOH, with the Fiero, do you have legal ownership of the &quot;no-title&quot;
&gt; vehicle?  However, how did that &quot;title-less&quot; Fiero get that way?  Most vehicles of
&gt; this sort seem to get that way through not-so-moral means and even if you
&gt; &quot;rescued&quot; the vehicle it may well be that someone else might still
&gt; have a legal claim to it.
