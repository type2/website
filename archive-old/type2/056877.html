Subject: Temp Sensor - Sump Plate.

I bought a sump plate that purported to be for the T4 engine (78 Bus).  It looks like a 'nose' has been added to the plate with a single 'nostril' for holding the sensor.  However, even without the sensor installed, I couldn't get it to go into place.  The 'nose' would always bang against the dipstick.  I think I might be able to trim a piece of the dipstick off.  But I was wondering if this was standard procedure.  This sump plate came with an addition plate to help protect the sender where it comes out.  

Any thoughts?  Do I have the wrong part? 

Thanks,
