Subject: Oil in valve cover...

Hi,

Today I adjusted the valves in &quot;la Vebe&quot; engine (1600 DP) and when I 
removed the right side cover about
half a quart of oil poured out. The left side only had a small amount of 
oil. Is that normal? The leak didn't stop until I put back the cover...
I had the back of the bus on ramp supports so I could fit under the engine 
while doing this. Did not having the engine level caused the big oil leak? 
I was surprised to see so much oil pour out of the cover since it never 
happened before.
Should I be worried also?

Thanks,

Rogelio
