Subject: Distributor spring

Oil pressure control spring???  More like a spring from a ball point
pen.  Its purpose is to load the dist. shaft upward against the thrust
washer between the drive 'dog' and the dist. body.

&gt;     Greetings everybody!  I do not recall finding a spring between the dizzy
&gt;
&gt; and dizzy drive while stripping my engine.  Could the engine have run
&gt; without
&gt; one?  Does anyone know where I can get one? I am thinking of using a spare
&gt; oil control valve spring.  I recall some book saying that it would work.
&gt; Finally, does anyone know exactly what purpose this spring serves?  Any help
&gt;
&gt;
