I would disagree that the type IV engine has fairly high compression.  A 
stock 2-liter bus engine with dished pistons is under 7.5 to 1.  The 60's 
muscle cars you are speaking of were much higher compression - some as high 
as 10 to 1.  Today's engines are even higher with 10.5 being typical for a 
well-designed engine.  My Mustang is currently at 9.6 (.5 higher than 
stock) and it runs fine on 87 octane as long as the timing is not excessive.

I also don't see how the burn rate of the fuel has anything to do with it 
when looking through the conservation-of-energy goggles.  Assuming high and 
low octane fuel contains the same amount of energy (right?  wrong?) and 
your mpg is the same with both fuels, the exact same amount of heat must be 
disspelled which means that one should not cause your engine to run hotter 
than the other.  Now if someone can prove to me that they get better mpg 
with higher octane fuel, I might be inclined to believe the engine runs 
cooler also.

&gt;And last, but far from least, we have forgotten how to drive an air cooled
&gt;engine.  The type 4 has so much torque, you can drive it like a water cooled
&gt;engine which is how a lot of people drive them.  If you don't keep your
&gt;engine at 3,000 - 3,500 RPM, you are burning it up.

I agree with one addition - this should only apply under heavy throttle 
conditions.  I think it's fine to lug the engine around town (within 
reason) since you will generally be only feathering the throttle.  You 
don't need as much cooling under these conditions.  My gauges show that 
after long freeway runs in the heat, my oil temperature will drop 20+ 
degrees in 5 minutes of driving on the city streets to get home.

CHT will shoot up initially though, so I always try to keep the revs up 
immediately after I exit the freeway, to cool the heads down a little.  One 
of the scarier things I've seen is driving with a hot engine on the freeway 
then immediately pulling over and stopping, say at a rest stop.  The CHT 
goes through the roof!  The reason is that there is some time delay between 
when the heat is produced in the combustion chamber and when it is removed 
at the fins by the cooling air.  If you suddently remove the cooling air, 
the heat will build up quickly.  I can't see this being good for the engine.
