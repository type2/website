Subject: failure notice (fwd)

&gt; Nope... You can have a failure...  Cams and lifters go through a very
&gt; important break in period. If either of the two are mismatched after the
&gt; break in, they can and most of the time will fail.

and what did VW do if a lifter failed????
anything can fail,  but the current cam is already matched to the other 6
lifters and when the lifter fails what is the option.....

&gt; If you are going to swap lifters, go to solid lifters.

I don't think anything would ever get me to go back to solid lifters. the
two jobs I ALWAYS hated about a VW was adjusting valves and points

a 78 comes stock with hyd lifters and I want em to stay that way
and I put a pertronix in the dizzy,  so after 12 years with my current bus
and about 70,000 miles on the current rebuild.....and 322,000 on the bus
