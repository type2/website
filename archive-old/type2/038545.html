In a word, no.

I have heard exactly one third hand story of someone who actually did this. 
And I don't put much stock in third hand accounts of any kind. I checked this
possibility out myself a few years back when I was in the market for a new
auto tranny for my '78 Westy. The conventional wisdom from just about
everybody I've spoken with about this (including good shops like Volks Cafe
in Santa Cruz, CA) is that the conversion would cost you considerably more
(money and/or personal time and energy) than it would to sell your auto bus
and buy another one that's already a manual tranny bus. And a lot of the cost
would be labor in cutting new holes for the shifts, welding in brackets and
tubes for the shifts and making all those square pegs fit in round holes.

If you are a handy welder with a lot of time on your hands and substantial
from-scratch mechanical aptitude, AND think the job would be your idea of a
good time, AND have a ready source of the junkyard parts you'll need AND just
can't possibly stand to part with your existing bus due to very substantial
and personalized investments in that vehicle, then have at it. If you are
like the rest of us, you're going to be dollars, busted knuckles and months
ahead of the game just trading buses. 

Your actual mileage may vary (but not by much).

Good luck,
