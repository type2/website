My friend Rob had an engine that was running way too hot.  Ran it for 5
minutes and you could hear the ting ting ting of the tin cooling down.
Turns out, the PO had a bad thermostat and adjusted it as if the
thermostat were good.  You got it - air vanes not coming all the way open.

So another point to remember is if you are running hot and don't know
diddly about your thermostat, go ahead and adjust it all the way up.  See
if you still over-heat.  You'll know if the thermostat is bad if it's all
the way extended on a cold engine.
