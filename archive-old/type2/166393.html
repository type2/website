Subject: [T2]: Valve seat issue again and again... (longish)

Hello all,

I love my bus, but I'm getting tired of changing the heads every 4 years
or so and I'm hoping of getting some insight in this problem. The story
so far:

This is a 78 Westy with stock 2 liter engine, dual carb setup. Bought it
about 10 years ago. PO apparently did not care about adjusting the
valves so I had to change both heads due to a dropped seat on the #3
intake valve and a burned exhaust valve on #1. Did not have much money,
installed 2 used heads with unknown background.

Ran ok for about 4 years, then had to struggle with a loose valve guide.
At that time I had some money, bought a completely reworked engine
(align-bored case, new P&amp;Cs, reworked heads, new valves, springs, etc.).

Engine ran strong for about 500 miles, then no compression on #3. Still
had guarantee on it, they said it was their fault and I got a new head.

This engine lastet until the beginning of last week (appr. 20.000
miles). Ran ok in the morning, fired it up for going to lunch. I could
hear a sudden rattle and strange sounds from the engine compartment and
shut it off immediately. I was still possible to turn it over by hand,
so I checked the timing, ... everything spot on.

Took of the valve cover and saw that #3 intake valve was still in
compressed position, even after taking of the rocker arm assembly. Took
of the head (with engine still in bus - major PITA, but on a public
parking space you sometimes have no other possible way of doing this...)
and #3 intake valve seat was not in correct position, preventing the
valve from closing properly.
Piston had only slight marks of contact, so I'll stick to the installed
P&amp;C's. I installed a used head (low on money...) from a known low mile
engine and I'm still in the process of putting it all together again.

Later this year I want to get some new heads, drop the engine and do it
&quot;the right way&quot;, but right now I just don't have the time and money. At
the end I want a reliable engine because this is a daily driver and I'm
doing big trips with the bus, too.

I'm pretty fussy about engine tune-up. I adjusting the valves and timing
on a monthly basis. The engine has never been overheated (according to
oil-temp-gauge always lower than 230 degrees fahrenheit) and I never
push it hard (max speed 60-70 mph). No vacuum leaks on intake or brake
booster. Carbs adjusted and synchronized by local bus specialist once a
year. The engine ran very, very smooth with lots of power, no
stuttering, no pinging, no back-firing.

So here are my questions:

(1) Why am I having this valve seat problem again and again. Is it
because of overheating? Shouldn't I just get burned valves if this is
the cause?

(2) Why is it always the intake? I thought exhaust valves get a lot
hotter...

(3) I read about new AVP heads. What about their quality? Do they really
last for long?

(4) Could the carbs be the source of the problem? Adjusted too lean?
Wouldn't oil-temperature indicate running lean (overall high oil-temp)?

Thank you in advance for your help, I will post links to some pictures
taken during the head-exchange for all of you that have to do this task
with a installed engine (don't do it if you can avoid it!).

Cheers,

Timo
