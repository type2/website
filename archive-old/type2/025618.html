I work in the industrial section of downtown Fayetteville, NC, and on our
street is an auto detailing shop that had to diversify after the city almost
put him out of business by tearing up the road three times in one year. It's
kinda hard to stay in the car-washing business if your shop's on a gravel
road, so he started buying old Volkswagens and restoring them. I think he's
completely out of the detailing business; there's money in them thar Bugs.

Anyway...he's recently scrounged up an old Westy Vanagon that has what looks
like the vented propane furnace out of an RV in it. I looked at it, and it's
definitely not stock--there are definite signs the PO went to the junkyard,
bought a furnace, and cut a hole in the side of the Vanagon with a Sawzall
for the chimney. Something about jagged-edged eight-sided holes just makes
ya kinda suspicious. I have no idea if this works though I can't see why it
wouldn't.

It's not something you'd do to your 21-window, but it's an alternative to
freezing your butt off.
