Demovic_at_aol_dot_com sends:

&gt; The oil cooler  on my 71 Westy is leaking. I ordered some from Rocky Mountain
&gt; and plan to replace the old ones this weekend. My question is: Is this
&gt; something that can be done without pulling the engine? I checked the archives
&gt; but didn't find an answer to my question. Thanks in advance for your help

On a 71? No way. You have to remove the fan shrouding to get to the oil
cooler, and there's not enough room to do it on a 71.
