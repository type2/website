Subject: [T2] Engine stands

Hey all,
  I have been working on an engine stand for doing
rebuilds. I did some
looking around and found nothing that I liked. I have 2
engine stands for
big V8s, but I don't do them. So I got a bench mount
stand from a VW store
in Salem Or. The stand is stil not what I wanted, it is
called heavy duty, I
would hate to see the cheaper one. The shaft that it is
on is only about
1.5in and would not fit the big stand I had. So I welded
a 2in pipe to it
and now it fits into both of my larger stands.
  So now my question is, does anyone make a larger
fixture for the ACVWs
that is as strong as the V8 stands? If not, would there
be anyone interested
if I decide to make heavier fixtures that will use the
heavier V8 type
stands? 
  I found that this so called &quot;heavy duty&quot; stand flexes a
lot with a
stripped type 4 short block, I bet it won't like a full
dress Bus engine.
