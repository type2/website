Subject: Re: [T2] Need help with possible engine purchase

Thanks for all your tips and your original write up, Mike. This one does 
have the oil filler cap, so that's a help.

----- Original Message ----- 

&gt;  As for the
 filler, obtain a filler that has a removable cap (later 914's and, I
 believe, VW 411's) so you don't have to remove that dang bale everytime you
 add oil.
