Subject: coughing

hey,
I run a 1600 SP with a 30PICT-3 carb that I just redid.  No clogs or
anything.  This only happens at low RPMs.  The motor likes to cough. It
happens when I just go into a gear.  but if I rev it real high (3K rpm)
it doesn't cough upon acceleration.

what are all the things that could make an engine cough?

Thanks
Isaiah
