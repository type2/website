Subject: Re: [T2] Burnt Exhaust valve?

Wow, dual 45 Dells on a 1.8??  Those are enormous carbs for that sized 
engine.  But you asked about a miss.  :-)

Since you have basically one carb per cylinder with those, it's possible 
the idle circuit could be plugged on that carb.  How does it feel under 
load?  Does the bus have significantly less power than normal?  Can you 
get it to 65mph?  If you can, then you probably do NOT have a burnt 
valve.  A burnt valve shows up in a compression test as zero compression 
- nada, nothing.  Not even 1 psi.

The other possibility is that the valve lash is too tight on that 
cylinder.  Sometimes, if the valve lash is zero or slightly negative the 
cylinder will fire under full power but not at idle.  This will show up 
in a compression test as low compression (say, 30-40psi).

Bottom line, adjust your valves FIRST, then do a compression test and 
you will then have all the info you need to find the source of your 
problem.  And for Pete's sake get some smaller carbs.  :-)
