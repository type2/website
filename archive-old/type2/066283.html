Hi, Wendy.

Eighteen-hundred for a rebuild of an 1800cc does seem high to me, if only
because after you're finished (as if) spending all that money, you've
still got an 1800cc. Remember, we're not talking about BMW's here. You
could probably get a shop-rebuilt 2000cc with fuel injection for less than
that. I bought a used engine from the famous Bob Donalds (of LiMBO) last
year for $100, drove it across the U.S. and continue to drive it around
Seattle, if that gives you any idea.  You could try Beaver Creek Bob's on
Hwy 101, about 10-15 miles south of Tilamook, or call around to the local
engine rebuild places until they point you to some better options.

&gt; Hello all. I recently bought a 74 bus with &lt; 48 k miles. It had been parked
&gt; for twelve years. The sellers had someone change the
&gt; oil,gasoline,plugs,points,etc.in hopes of starting it. It apparently ran
&gt; for about 20 seconds. Long enough for one piston to crash into one stuck
&gt; valve. Bad things ensued. With the help of a friend the engine is out and
&gt; partially disassembled. I'm left with 3 good barrel assembles, 3 good
&gt; connecting rods, one bent [slightly] rod, possibly metal particles passed
&gt; through oil pump, intact crankcase, one good head, [one destroyed] and one
&gt; otherwise very clean bus. My question is, wouldn't it be better to rebuild
&gt; &quot;this&quot; engine rather than trade the core and get an engine that perhaps has
&gt; a million miles on it  before rebuild? The cylinder walls still have cross
&gt; hatching and it's very clean inside and out. No oil leaks. Problem is the
&gt; approximately $1800. estimate I got. Either way, about the same price. Is
&gt; this high for a rebuild even if I take it out and put it back in? In
&gt; Portland, Or. there are only a few VW mechanics. None of my friends know
&gt; anything about aircooled engines so not much help here. I haven't even
&gt; driven this veewee yet and I love it! It's so clean and straight. Only
&gt; needs a muffler. [and rebuild] Btw, could it be that this mechanic charges
&gt; by the CC? Just kidding. Anyway, all help would be appreciated.
