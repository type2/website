Subject: Re: [T2] Finally figured it out???

Not just VW's but carburated vehicles in general.

When I went to get tires on my bus, they wouldn't let my pull the bus
in the bay (normal for shops). The kid that got the job of pulling it
in fired it up, and started driving. He didn't kick down the fast idle
or wait a moment to let the engine get even a little warm or anything.

So he's pulling in with the idle at 2200rpm, and it's blamming away
making all kinds of racket (exhaust leak) in the echoing cavernous
service bay. I was laughing my arse off.

The kid came into the waiting room all embarassed, and asked me what
driving that antique is like.

My reply?

&gt; In this day and age where VW's are unique, most people were just not taught
&gt; how to drive them.  I'm not saying this is your problem, but I have seen
&gt; this many times.
