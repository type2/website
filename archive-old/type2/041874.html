Dave,  Go ahead and post it.  I haven't made exact plans yet, and don't
want to run around toting boxes of stuff, but would like to help folks
if I can.

John:
There's a few of us on the VW lists that have Dormobiles.  Not all have
found this one.  Is it ok if I cross post your offer to the VW lists?  I
know you'll get several requests for skylight gaskets at the very least.

Regards
Dave
Hey,

At the end of July, I'll be taking a trip to England on work and have
allowed myself a couple days at each end for personal stuff.  I hope
to stop by and see Dormobile LTD.  If I do, I can pick up items from
Simon and bring them home for shipping from the US.  So, if you
need/want something, let me know.  He has some web pages up but I
don't think his whole catalog is online. www.dormobile_dot_com

cheers,

John F. Hess, Davis California
