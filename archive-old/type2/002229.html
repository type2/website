Subject: Original paint colors/Bolt sizes

Esteemed Listees -

Is there a number on the chassis of my 71 Campmobile that I can decode to
give me the original paint scheme for my bus? Where would I look and once I
find the #, where can I find out what it means?
A while back, I posted a question about the sizes of the bolts which mount
the outer ends of the front bumper. No one seemed to have the answer -
figured it out. For those who need this info, they are 8mm, 1.25 pitch
self-tapping bolts with fender washers. The size question was driving me
nuts until I realized the bolt threads were really mucked up with
rust-n-stuff. A tap soon cleared this up.
Believe it or not, I then found a guy only a couple of blocks away with a 70
Westy. In return for fixing his bus (bad battery, high idle, VERY little oil
caught just in time), he let me borrow a bolt to match up.
Bus folk are the best!

TIA,

Tom
