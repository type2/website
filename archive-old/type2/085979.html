Subject: Re: [T2] restorations... (friday)


&gt;
&gt;In his book The Fifth Elephant, Terry Pratchett says a few interesting
&gt;things about the way heirlooms change over generations.

I'd like to think these thoughts are true for something I pass down to my 
child.  A heirloom has a certain emotional value that is independent of the 
physical properties of the said object.

An automobile, sold at a very high price, does have the same emotional value 
as a heirloom.  This is not to say it could not hold this value for the 
buyer willing to pay the price.
