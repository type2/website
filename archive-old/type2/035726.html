&gt; &gt;I believe the anti-seize was insulating the threads and causing
&gt; &gt;the sensor to read 'open'.
&gt;
&gt; I believe I have the same problem, as I installed the sensor with
&gt; antiseize. Actually, I installed a sensor on each head, both with
&gt; antiseize. One is reading around 950, the other about 1247, both when the
&gt; bus is cold. Should be up around 2500-4000.

You have bad sensors. If you had an insulation problem, you would have 2
different readings depending on where you measured. If you measure from the
wire to the base of the sensor and then measure from the wire to the cyl.
head, the figure should be the same. If you have an insulation problem, i.e.
a poor connection thru the threads, the latter reading would be higher or
infinity. Not lower.
