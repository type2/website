Please help me out with a part #

I made a second trip to the parts store to get brake shoes and they're STILL
wrong.

The first trip, I got the right shape, but the wrong width.   The second
time I got the right width, but the wrong shape.   Surely to god they will
get it right this time, but the imports parts counter guy wasn't there today.

I've seen this parts store decline over the last coupla decades.   It
originally had a storefront called Import Motor Products a couple of doors
down from Motor Products, it's parent store.   They got bought out by
Federated Auto Parts, closed down Import Motor Products, and moved the
import business into the main store.   Only one import parts person is there
(and he drives a Fiat - nothing personal against Fiats) and he's the same
guy I've dealt with for lo, these many years.
