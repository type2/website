Subject: Re: [T2] tune-up madness

OK,

Here is my trick on setting points.

You have to have a helper or remote start switch though.

Put the new points in and adjust &quot;close&quot;.

Start the engine and see what the dwell says.
Pull the dist cap and rotor and have your buddy crank the
engine long enough for you to get a feel for the difference
in what it was running v.s. what it is when cranking.

Adjust points while buddy is cranking engine.  Tighten them
and start engine.  Check dwell...repeat until you are happy!

Cheers, dave

&gt; bought the '68 breadloaf a while ago but haven't put
&gt; much mileage on it because i've been fixing stuff and
&gt; passing inspections, etc. First tune up.
&gt; 
&gt;  For what its worth. the bus has been running
&gt; fantastically (and cool, even in 90* weather). But i
&gt; figured i put off the tuneup long enuff.
&gt; 
&gt; did valves. most of them were tight--as if the p.o.
&gt; had set 'em at .004. They're all .006 now.
&gt; 
&gt; headscratcher 1. how do you get the %#_at_! points
&gt; adjusted? they were tight. I adjust using a feeler for
&gt; rough guidance, then put the dist. back together and
&gt; final check with a dwell meter. I can't seem to get
&gt; closer than about 10 degrees to the recommended 50
&gt; degrees. After an hour of frustration, I left them to
&gt; the loose side. For the love of god-- Is there a
&gt; trick?
&gt; 
&gt; headscratcher 2. tho the bus is an early '68, my
&gt; engine appears to be a '66 to '67 single port. the
&gt; serial number starts with HO. The books say i should
&gt; time it to 7.5 btdc.  But my crank pulley only has ONE
&gt; notch, presumably 0 degrees. (did someone switch
&gt; pulley's in the bus' checkered past?)
&gt; 
&gt; Any guidance appreciated.
&gt; 
&gt; BTW, took the bus for a test run--it still runs great.
