Subject: pictures! bike rack, stero, misc

Hola,

So I finally picked up one of those Hollywood bike racks, and for only $50, 
it works great. Still have access to the engine compartment to!
Also in the pictures is my recent stereo install, and the marine switch used 
to toggle back and forth between batteries when I am not driving.
