Subject: external oil coolers

Many responded to my question about running at 250 degrees oil temperature
by saying that I should install an external oil cooler. I've scanned the
ads in the mags and found several.  The photos are too small to give me
much of a clue as to how to integrate such a gadget with my 1776 engine.

Could someone please describe where such coolers mount? How does oil enter
and leave them?  Must an engine be equipped with a full flow oil system to
utilize them?

Thanks, Jack
