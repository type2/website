Subject: 81 road trip, oil temp &amp; gas mileage

Drove 200 miles today taking the youngster to camp in N. Ga. with some
interesting results. Generally ran in the 50 to 60 mph range which I had come
to expect to develop temps in the 230* to 250* range. Instead, I ran
consistently at 210* to 220* with the odd spike to 230* when really goosing
it. 

What was different? Probably most important was the weather which was rainy
and in the 70's rather than high 80's or 90's. Incredibly, it was cool enough
to experiment with the heater which I had done a lot of work with during the
rebuild. Lots of heat!  Also having an effect I think was fabricating a
half-assed heat shield over the muffler with a piece of aluminum flashing. I
doubt that it had an impact at speed but I honestly felt like it made a huge
difference in the motors ability to cool itself after slowing from speed.
Previously, if I heated to 230*+ there was nothing short of shutting it off
that would bring the temps down. Today it was no problem at all which meant
that I was able to worry a lot less about the oil pressure as it would cool
itself back to 210* reasonably quickly. Finally, I've started topping up with
15/50 Mobil 1 in an effort to combat heat but that was only today so that is
just an experiment in progress.

Gas mileage was about 13.5 vs 12.5 on the initial trip. How can mileage be
that bad in a vehicle that appears to be running well? I am not pouring gas
on the ground, the heads are new Mark Stephens, it's recently tuned,  it runs
smoothly, and the parking brake is off. I'm going to pull the plugs soon and
check the compression to see what that tells me. What else should I consider?

I did have one idea that maybe I was driving a lot faster than I thought.
Some time ago when my wife and I were driving in tandem(I had little faith in
the bus and she had none) I switched with her on a country road so she could
experience the fun. As she took off on the winding road I had trouble
following her in the big ford wagon at an apparent 60 mph. Later when I
ragged her about her heavy foot she claimed that she was only doing 50 so we
concluded that the wagon was off by as much as 10mph. Today I noticed that
while I plugged along at 55 to 60 in 65 and 70 mile mph zones, I had plenty
of company in the right lane and those passing on the left didn't seem to do
so at laser speed. Anyone familiar with, or terrified by, Atlanta expressways
knows that speed limits are only low end suggestions. In addition, twice I
really sat on it to see what top speed was and I ran into a brick wall at
68/70 which I was under the impression was supposed to be out there at 80.
What do you think, wishful thinking?

Finally are there characteristic drip patterns for certain oil leaks? It
doesn't leak when parked and all the pushrod tubes are new and dry. The oil
that isn't vaporized and sprayed over the back of the bus drips upon stopping
off the engine carrier bar. Oil seems to be distributed all over the bottom
of the motor. The left heater box is relatively dry while the right is fairly
wet along with that piece of bottom tin, therefore I suspect the right valve
cover. I can let it idle for a while without producing a drop. How do I pin
the source down?

Thanks,

Weston
