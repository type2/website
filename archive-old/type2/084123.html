Subject: Engine turns no start

Thanks to some help from Steve I was able to figure out why my new motor 
wouldn't turn over. I had the ignition wire on the wrong post. It had a 
ring terminal on it from the PO ford relay. My new starter
also only had one tab on the solenoid. I bought a adapter at Radio Shack 
and now the motor turns over. I am able to build oil pressure and the 
idiot light goes out. I put some gas in it and tried to turn it over. It 
wants to try and start if I turn the distrubuter so the vacumn advance 
is jammed against the cold
start valve. When I line up the timing mark on O deg and number one with 
the line on the dist it is almost tight against the cold start valve 
also. It chugs for a second and dies. The distr. only fits in one way. 
Any suggestions on where to start? I hear the fuel pump run. When the 
key is in start position.
