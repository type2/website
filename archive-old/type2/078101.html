Subject: Re: [T2] heater knob question

That is the knob for the optional gas heater. It regulates how much heat the
heater puts out. If you don't have the gas heater you just get the
knob...hence no cable.

Subject: [T2] heater knob question


&gt; i'm closing in on finishing my heat setup.
&gt; 1. Good heater boxes.
&gt; 2. Flaps locked open.
&gt; 3. Insulated the duct pipe to the front of the bus
&gt; 4. Set of  circa '71 bus heater blowers hooked up.
&gt; 5. Doghouse holes blocked
&gt; 6. Plugged the vents under the &quot;way-back&quot; seat
&gt;
&gt; Heat temp good, but the air velocity at defrosthers is
&gt; meager. (Part of it is that Those VW blowers aren't
&gt; exactly tornados.)
&gt;
&gt; I'm trying to figure out how the narrow vent under the
&gt; walk-through between the front seats works. I have a
&gt; knob under the driver's right leg that has something
&gt; to do with it. Is out ON and in OFF? Of course, it may
&gt; be disconnected--where does that cable go? I can't
&gt; find it under the bus. The terminus of the ducts is
&gt; covered with a vinyl/asbestos boot that I'm afraid to
&gt; move without an EPA permit.
&gt;
