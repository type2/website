Subject: Re: [T2] Type 1 engine Alternator Wiring instead of Gen

&gt;From: &quot;Snoopy&quot; Ok, Since I had so many responses, all saying they needed 
&gt;more info. Here
&gt;are some pics of the current voltage regulator (presently installed) along
&gt;with the alternator (attached to fan housing) plus the voltage regulator
&gt;(the one in my hand) that I bought that is supposedly for a 72 bus.  I am
&gt;unsure if this alternator has an internal regulator or not.  Can someone
&gt;please confirm if I need to wire it up as you do for a 72 bus?

Does that regulator have any designations for the colored wires? I think 
this is how it goes

Brown          = D-
Green           = DF
Red(small)     = D+
Red(big)       = B+  This goes straigh to the starter.

Now there should be a blue wire(small) in there some where that is the lead 
to your instrument cluster Generator Light, this has to be connected to D+ 
at th regulator side.

Hope this helps and is correct I am going from the notes in my Hanes for the 
Type I that gave me fit last time I did this. But looking at the Bentley it 
seems to make sense.

Good Luck,
