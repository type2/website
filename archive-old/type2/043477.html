&gt; &gt; But go westy's are for leaded fuel nozzles. Here in California you cannot
&gt; &gt; pass the Smog Check visual if you don't have a fillpipe restricter for
&gt; &gt; unleaded nozzles. Yes, I know that all you can buy is unleaded but I guess
&gt; &gt; the state of California doesn't.....
&gt; 
&gt; The fillpipe restrictor on a lot of cars had a little flap in it to keep the
&gt; gas fumes inside the car. This also explains the bellows on the gas pump
&gt; nozzles.

I've never seen a restrictor flap that truly seals fumes.  In fact, there
are usually small vent holes in the top of the restrictor plate.

The real reason for the restrictor flap is to stop people from squirting
gas into the end of the filler neck with a leaded nozzle or gas can.  The
flap closes the main passage into the tank, so you need the correct nozzle
to fill it (or an automatic transmission funnel &lt;g&gt;).

The bellows on the nozzle are some bureaucrat's stupid idea.  I've seen
more gas spilled from these nozzles than ever from non-booted nozzles,
and a little liquid makes a _lot_ of vapor!  Unfortunatly, here in the
Golden State, stupid ideas tend to hang on for years when the Smog Czars
are behind them.  Some stations now have vapor recovery nozzles without
boots, which actually do the job for which they were intended.  They have
holes around the outside of the nozzle that draw in vapor.
