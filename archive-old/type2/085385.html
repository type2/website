Subject: Re: [T2] racing buses on dirt

Matty Kirk sends:

&gt; i think it would be cool, and i'm very interested in
&gt; trying to do it. no campers, of course, that would
&gt; just be foolish (I think). i'm thinkin i would
&gt; probably just get a regular bay, strip down the
&gt; interior. install two roll bars. one right behind the
&gt; front seats, and one in the rear, where the bench seat
&gt; used to be. probably some sway bars too, and decent
&gt; tires. which BTW does anyone know of a link for some
&gt; decent dirt racing tires?

Bus racing? Hell, they race everything else and people pay to watch it--
did anyone here see the TNN Motor Madness segment a few years ago on lawn
tractor racing?--so people would pay to watch this. You might even get it on
television; the Speed Channel needs lots of racing and all the sports
channels out there need footage, so why not show VW Buses going like hell?

You'd probably want six classes:
 
Class 1--stock Type 1 engine Buses (this means the engine itself is stock in
displacement and carburetion--the Bus itself would need to be modified)
Class 2--modified Type 1 engine Buses
Class 3--stock Type 4 engine Buses
Class 4--modified Type 4 engine Buses
Class 5--Buses with 6-cylinder watercooled engines and VW transmissions
Class 6--unlimited Buses--put a Robert Yates engine and Jerico transmission
driving a 9-inch Ford rear end in the Bus if you like.
