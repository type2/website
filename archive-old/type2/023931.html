OK, I'll cut to the chase. The Terrapin Flyer - a '72
Westy with 009 and Holley / Webber dbl bbl 
progressive... Yesterday I was coming home from work - a
25 minute drive with stopping to pick up the kids from
daycare. 5 minutes to daycare, shut the bus off, load
the kids and then start up and drive for 15 minutes. 
Halfway from home, I experienced a loss of power in 4th 
gear. I thought that I might be starting to run out of 
gas, as my fuel gauge at best is an estimate. Actually 
slowed down involuntarily and put it in 3rd when I was 
down low enough. Engine performed well again and had no 
problems even in 4th the rest of the way to the gas
station to put a few $ in.

Today coming home from work, the bus did the same 
thing on the same stretch of road. This time, I had 
only stopped at a fast food place, but had not turned 
off the engine. Same thing - shifted into 3rd and did 
not have a problem after that. 

What could be happening? 

Hope that I have given enough info.

TIA
