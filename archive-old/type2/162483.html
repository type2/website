&gt; Could one actually build a VW without a single VW-built part in it?
&gt; Are there frames and enough body parts available from alternate
&gt; sources?  Everything else should be available as a non-VW part, I
&gt; think.  Might be an interesting thing to try ...

How VW would it have to be, for example if the part is a Bosch used by VW
is it VW or is it &quot;a somewhere else part&quot;

of course frames could be hand made by a good welder.   I can think of a
few specialty parts that could be a problem like front beams....
