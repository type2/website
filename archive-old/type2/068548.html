Subject: Matchbox Type II's

My brother collected Matchbox cars as a kid and has just rediscovered his
old collection.  He's getting back into it.  I've just started fixing my '62
Westfalia.  I asked him if he had any Matchbox Type II's,  here's what he
sent back.

Steve
'62 Westy 
 
&gt;
&gt;The Matchbox Volkswagen Camper, light green #34-B is 2 and 3/4 inch and
&gt;was released in 1962. It is stamped &quot;Volkswagen Caravette&quot;.
&gt;
&gt;The Matchbox Volkswagen Camper, silver with raised roof #34-C is 2 5/8 and
&gt;was released in 1967. It is stamped &quot;Volkswagen Camper&quot;
&gt;
&gt;The 67 has 19 windows; the 62 has 13 windows. I have moved them to a place
&gt;of honor in recognition of your project.
&gt;
&gt;Matchbox also had a Volkswagen Van &quot;Matchbox Express&quot; #34-A that was 2 and
&gt;1/4 inch and was released in 1957. I have never seen one.
&gt; 
&gt;Why is one of the campers stamped &quot;Caravette&quot;? Is it a VW term or a
&gt;mistake? 
&gt;
