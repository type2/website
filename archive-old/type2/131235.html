Subject: Re: [T2] Re: POR 15 Corrosion Control Process

heh... That's mine. ;)

But if we do a west coaster, I only really want to concentrate on windows
up... Only 2 small spots of rust to deal with there, and I could fiberglass
those before hand.

There's plenty of sheet metal work waist-down, and I don't think it's
reasonable to expect other people to work their arses off to clean up that
kind of mess.

BUT: there doesn't seem to be the response on the west coast. :(

Ah, well. C'est La Vie!
