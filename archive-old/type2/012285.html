That's about it. I live in this serious suburban
whitebread neighborhood, and the stereotyping drives
me bughouse sometimes. On the other hand, I
occasionally enjoy the shocked look on people's faces
when they discover that the guy they thought was a
60's leftover pot-smoking hippie freak is a
professional person who owns a suburban home within a
mile of their own, and makes more money than they do.
(Not that I define myself by my income, but people in
my neck of the woods tend to define themselves by
their income and their possessions.)

I also much enjoyed pulling up to the local Home Depot
in my ratted-out '71 Bus (then a daily driver, now a
current restoration project), and watching people
driving their $40,000 SUV's look on in envy as I
loaded full sheets of plywood into my bus, while they
were trying to strap small items to their $2,000
roof-rack option. Especially when one of them
discovered that I gave a massive $333.33 for it, and
had been driving it for a year after doing the brakes,
changing the fuel lines, and giving it a tune up. 

&gt; Most people that drive them are pretty nice, but
&gt; some of us that build them
&gt; are sometimes more comfortable negotiating with
&gt; machines than we are with
&gt; people.

I'm one of those social inepts, myself, but every VW
owner who knows me I tend to get along with.
