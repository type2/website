Subject: Re: [T2] Ball joint boots only?

The ball joint boots I bought from Volks Cafe in nearby Santa Cruz, CA  were 
$3 or less and Bus Boys used to have them for even less as I recall.

Does $10 include removing the old joints? If so, a great deal.

 re: ball joint boots.

 One problem is that the boots are almost as expensive at the complete ball
 joint! And the quality of the ones I have seen is poor, the rubber is 
really
 thin. Maybe there are some other boots on the market I have not seen.

 Starting next month we will be offering the complete reconditioned torsion
 arms with new ball joints.

 For anyone who is local to us, we will also press your ball joints into the
 arms for 10.00 each.
