Alan,

I had the same problem. It turned out to be a vacuum leak. In my case it
was at the manifold boots. Fixed the leak and the problem went away
instantly. Try checking the manifold vacuum with a gauge and see if it
is where it should be. If you cant do this, use some WD40(ive heard carb
cleaner also works) and spray it around the manifold joints and see if
the engine sounds changes, if it does, you found your leak. Hope this
helps.

Jonathan
