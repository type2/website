Subject: Bed Design.

Last weekend the s/o and me junked the nasty camper interior, from our newly
acquired 69 deluxe microbus. So, I need to start thinking about refitting
some kind of diy interior into the bus.

I'm struggling with the design of the bed.

Ideally, I'd like a 3/4 width rear bench seat, that *somehow* makes up a 3/4
width bed, the full length of the loading area (approx. 5'10&quot;).

The part I'm struggling with, is how to suspend the extended boards/slats,
and where to get the spare mattress bits from (as the bench seat will only
provide about 3-4' of covering).

Anyone else gone down the road of doing their own interior b4?
