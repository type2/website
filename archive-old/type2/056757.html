Subject: Re: Reading Labels and TSP

I work for the Home Depot's corporate office, and our stores (at least the
Atlanta market) sell TSP.  I think it is a 1 lb box.  The real stuff I
believe.  The local Wal-Mart sells &quot;TSP Substitute&quot; that is phosphate free.
 That is the environmently friendly stuff that does not work as well.  The
Atlanta HD stores carry it by Custom Building Products, and it can be found
in the paint department.

I collect old military firearms and have used TSP several times to clean
off the cosmeline that they pack the rifles in and to strip the wood finish
off.  I know it will take all the oil, grease, etc. off of anything.  It
never hit me until recently to use the TSP for greasy VW parts.  I have
never used it to strip paint off metal, but have stripped paint off wood
with it.  I cleaned my new (old) door lock assembly with hot TSP the other
night (HD TSP) and they still had some grease on them, but a paper towel
wiped it right off.  I think it did a fine job.

As a side note, ever tried oven cleaner?  I have also used that to strip
wood finishes on rifles.  It too takes paint off wood, not sure about
metal.  When I've used it, I coated the stock with oven cleaner, let it sit
for about 10-15 minutes, then rinsed it off and scrubbed with synthetic
steel wool to remove the &quot;bubbles&quot; where paint and polyurethane would
blister up.  After it dies, you have bare wood.  I was going to try oven
cleaner on my engine tin before repainting it.  It should work.

Your mileage may vary
