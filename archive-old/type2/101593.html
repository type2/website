&gt;  I have those carbs in stock. I haven't had the opportunity to test them
&gt;out yet and will have on display at BBB VII. They are actually 32/34 PDSI/2
&gt;carbs but without all the adjustments as on a 72 and above type 2. On the
&gt;carbs are cast Borosol and Solex.
&gt;  Type 4 kits are not available yet, but are in the works. The price on type
&gt;1 kits $299.95 with type 4 should be close to that.
******************************
These kits were readily available in the 80s. I had a set retrofitted on my
12v converted Dual Port 1600 64 Notchback at the time (certainly a lot
smoother than the original 32PDSITs) and a buddy's Crew Cab as well.  They
were mainly brought in by one importer, Overland Parts Express, but they
haven't hardly imported any Air Cooled stuff in a decade.

The linkage isn't the greatest, but they worked OK, jetting is primarily
for 1600s, but can be rejetted and venturis changed for better performance
and bigger engine displacement.

This carb setup was generally used on European Type 3s as original
equipment through the 70s and optional on the upright engine Beetles (all
with the appropriate manifolds of course).  Brosol has always been a major
supplier into Europe for quite some time now.
