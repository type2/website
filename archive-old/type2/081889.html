Subject: Re: [T2] Wheel bearings

Hi Bill,
Try to get as much shakedown time in as you can before you hit the road.
Nothing like finding about a problem with the rebuild or the installation
when you're stuck on the side of 95.

The wheel bearings are easy.  Problem is you won't know if you need to
replace them until you get the old ones out and clean them up and inspect
them.  Bearings are fairly inexpensive so I might just replace them as a
matter of course if the history is uknown.  Be sure to get quality bearings
from a manufacturer such as FAG or SKG.  If they're made in Germany instead
of China or India than so much the better.

When you buy bearings they will come with replacement races as well.  Also
you will need the oil seal that goes on the other side of the hub, since you
will destroy the old one taking it out, and you must take it out to get to
that inner bearing.

So 4 bearings total, 2 each inner and outer and 2 oil seals, plus grease of
course :-)
I think I packed mine with Mobil 1 synthetic grease last time.  It's pink so
at least that's a change of pace.

OK so you take the wheel off and then pop the dust cap off the hub.  usually
a crowbar or some channel lock pliers will do the trick.  You will have to
kind of wiggle it off with alternating prying motions.

Remove the calipers.  The bolts are 19mm as I recall and they are likely to
be tight, as the factory used lock-tite on them.  A breaker bar will help
but there's not a whole lot of room down there with all the front suspension
in the way.  Trying turning the steering wheel as necessary to get the best
room.  Have some bent coat hanger bits nearby so you can hang the calipers
up so as not to stress the rubber brake hoses.

Once that's off you will find the clamp nut.  This is the nut you use to
adjust bearing freeplay.  It threads on around the stub axle and then there
is an allen bolt that is used to clamp it tight.  Loosen the allen bolt and
then unscrew the nut.  I think one side is left-hand threaded onto the axle.
There is also a big washer there used to distribute the load on the
bearings.

Now you can just pull the rotor/hub assembly straight off.  This will make
the outer bearing fall off into your hand.  Then you will set the hub/rotor
face down on the ground, pry out the oil seal from the rear and remove the
inner bearing.

Clean everything up (get all the old grease off).

The bearing races are pressed into the hub.  If you are replacing the
bearings, you have to tap out the old races and tap in the new ones.  The
new ones come with the new bearings.  Bentley shows this being done with a
hydraulic press but you can do it with a good sized hammer and a drift.

Naturally if you replace the rotors you will need to tap the races out of
the old rotors and tap them into the new ones.

Then you want to grease the new bearings.  You don't want to use too much
grease, as that can make the bearings run hot.  I don't know if Bentley
shows a spec for how much grease to use, but if it does, stick to that.

Pack the new bearings with grease and insert the inner one into the hub.
Install the new oil seal, then mount the hub/rotor assembly.

Install the calipers.

Slide the outer bearing onto the stub axle and fit it into its race.  Slide
on the washer and screw on the clamp nut.  Tighten down the clamp nut to
snug.  For this next part I like to fit the wheel so I can feel for when the
bearing tension is right.  If the bearings are too loose, you will have
excessive wandering and sloppiness in the steering.  If the bearings are too
tight, they will get hot and wear prematurely.

I usually spin the wheel with one hand while I am tightening the clamp nut
with the other to the point where it's snug but it's not making the wheel
bind.  Then I will push-pull on the wheel to make sure it doesn't clunk all
around and if it does, I will snug it some more.  There is also a bearing
endplay spec in Bentley to which you should adhere, though I admit I go by
when it feels right.

Once you have gotten it right, tap on the dust cap, lower the Bus and
tighten the wheel nuts.

Then repeat on the other side.

Note that on a Bus the speedometer cable is run to the driver's side hub and
pokes through the dust cap where it is held by a circlip.  Don't lose that
circlip when you are taking it all apart.  It's really small and it likes to
fly off across the room if you aren't careful.

&gt; Wow,thanks for the fast replies on the mexican hatch seal. Rob is going
&gt; to let me check it out first hand. Nothing better that seeing with my
&gt; own eyes. Now another quick question while I have everyone's attention.
&gt; It's getting real close to leaving for everybus and I am starting to get
&gt; a little nervous. I put a rebuilt engine in,all new
&gt; hoses,injectors,heater boxes,exhuast and it's running real good. I am
&gt; going to check the brakes and bearing this weekend and replace the
&gt; rubber hoses. I also want to flush out all the brake fluid. My question
&gt; is on the bearings. I have new seals and plan on regreasing them. I've
&gt; never done it on a bus before and would like some suggestion on how.
&gt; Also do I have to replace the front bearings if I replace the front
&gt; rotors?( I do have a Bentley but I left at work).
