I am running a Berg oil pump relief cover on my '71 Westy.  As I recall, I
added a couple of washers between the hanger and the case to gain the extra
clearance.  No problems in two years.  Berg suggests hammering the hanger to
get the clearance, but I wouldn't cut any metal out.
&gt;
&gt;&gt; List,
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; While gathering info for this 71 bus engine, i have learned that there
may be
&gt;&gt; beetle cases that can be drilled and tapped for the rear bar.
&gt;&gt; This is cool.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; I have also learned tentatively that i may not be able to run the
full-flow
&gt;&gt; oil pump cover because it won't clear the rear bar.
&gt;&gt; Any thoughts?
