Subject: Re: '71 Rear Wheel Bearing

&quot;Fix the cheapest thing first...&quot; if there is any doubt...
	I don't know how much the bearings are for the front of a '71, but I'd
really want to do them first... I thought my '65 had a bad rear one, and
I was getting ready to pull the engine/tranny when I thought I'd give
the front ones a try first... fixed it. Weird harmonic vibes in the bus
fooled me, i suppose.
	But... The bearings that go on the stub axles of a '71 *shouldn't*
(IMHO) be that expensive. Neither are they that hard to put on.... also
IMHO. It may be stupid, but sometimes I replace things so that i can
know for sure that they are new and won't give trouble...
(yeah... good time for new CV boots, too...)
