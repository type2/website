Subject: Re: [T2] Split CV boots: Can they last 2 weeks?

On the Samba forum, you were talking about installing CDI before going 
to Denver. So why don't you have time to get good CV boots and install 
them? A darn sight more important, if you ask me.

Neither split boots nor shredded ones will get you to Denver. So I hope 
you like Barstow! You'll be there awhile!

&gt; Like I said I've got zero chance of pulling the things and doing it
&gt; right before I leave and was hoping to offer up some protection.
