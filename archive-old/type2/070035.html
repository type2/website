&gt; I removed the 12V/120V dometic fridge components from Lief
&gt; today and put in a drain so that I now have an icebox.
&gt; ...
&gt; I didn't want to throw it out, so if anyone in BC wants it, it's
&gt; free for the taking.  You can use it to convert an icebox into a
&gt; fridge although personally I prefer the icebox.

I've been wanting to get my fridge working. I could use your fridge
components. It looks easy to remove the fridge for refitting, but
is it true that the back seat has to come out first?

I may be in Vancouver early next month, but that is not a sure
thing. I guess we should discuss shipping, if I'm the lucky recipient.

&gt; Well I checked my point gap this morning for the first time (not
&gt; the first time they've been checked, just the first time I checked
&gt; them myself).

My answer to your question about point gap would be to get rid
of your points.

The same day I waved goodbye to you and the Inuvik Explorers, I
bought a Pertronix Ignitor. Good thing too, 'cuz the engine started
missing on the way back to Victoria.

After all taxes, the Ignitor was $125 at California Import Parts.
Bow-Wow in Victoria doesn't sell Pertronix Ignitors.

The Ignitor was as easy to install as putting in new points and
condenser. Easier to adjust I'd say, since the gap does not have to
be as precise. The engine doesn't miss any longer.

Van: 1977 Westy; Distributor: 021 905 205 P. ( I learned something
new from the Haynes manual when removing the distributor. I didn't
have to loosen the clamp bolt. Instead I removed the nut from the stud
holding the clamp to the crankcase. I don't remember this being
possible on the 1600 in my '63 van. Supposedly the timing won't be
disturbed removing it this way, but I noticed I could rotate the
distributor a bit when the nut was loose. I did adjust the timing
after re-installing the distributor.)
