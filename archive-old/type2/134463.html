Subject: Re:Propane fuel conversion on 1977

Timothy,
    In 1980 I worked for KLM airlines in Holland.  For use on the
airport as maintenance vehicles they had aircooled buses that ran on
LPG.  There was a special exhaust pipe that had tubing wrapped around
it and then the tubing was wrapped with sheetmetal.  It looked like a
large tin can with an exhaust pipe sticking out of each end.  And of
course it had the tubing ends sticking out too.  That tubing was
plumbed to heat the fuel, or so I was told.  Anyway, the buses ran
just fine.  Maybe you need to check with some European bus owners or
vendors to see if they can gather info for you.
