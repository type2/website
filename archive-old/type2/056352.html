Subject: July 1998 CostCo tire report, $48 for 6-ply &quot;C&quot; load house brand

I searched the archives and the most recent reports about Costco
indicated that the Uniroyal Larado C rated 6-ply tires were the
choice... but the last post with Costco anywhere in it was 9 months or
older...

So I went today, half expecting that they didn't carry the Uniroyal
anymore... and they don't, at least not here in Seattle.  What they do
have is their house brand tires, &quot;Kirkland&quot;.  They have ONLY ONE
SUITABLE TIRE in the entire store, they don't have a 14 inch LT tire of
any other brand or size.

I went for them, as the $48 price was decent.  These are 6-ply (2 on
sidewall) &quot;C&quot; load tires, more than suitable for my '71 bus.  195/75R14
... which seems to be the main size that most on the list are going with
(based on my archive searches).  $7 to have them installed, no charge
(at least in WA) to have old tires disposed of.  Westy owners,
especially later models (1972+) may opt to go elsewhere to get &quot;D&quot; load
tires (higher load, typically 8 ply).

I'll report if I experience any problems.  Drive great so far.

P.S.  They actually use a torque wrench to install the lugs.  At least I
know I have a chance of getting the tires back off ... I have some front
brake work to finish.
