Subject: Magnesium and Aluminum (was re:old cases and faying surfaces -Reply)

Yep, the T1 (71 &amp; older buses in the US) cases are magnesium and
the T4's (72 buses on) are aluminum.  The cool thing about the
T4's is that you can weld them.  The cool thing about the T1's
is that you can burn them like we did at Burning Man a couple of
weekends ago.

Someone piled up a ring of 6 cases on the bottom, 4 on top of
that, then 2 on top of that, and lit the whole pile.  It took
some significant effort with a propane/mapp torch to get them
all started, but once they did start, a) you would be stupid to
look directly at them, and b) I don't think any fire
extinguisher would put them out--the heat was impressive 40 feet
away.
