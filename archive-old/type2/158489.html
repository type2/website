Subject: fired her up, sort of

well, today i finished putting the engine together and the FI and the
exhaust.  everything hooked up matching the pics i took before i took
it all apart.  thank god i did that.
first couple of cranks she just turned no fire.  played w/ the
distributor a little and she fired up and ran when nancy, my neighbor,
held down the accelerator pedal.  couldn't get her to idle.  goethe,
the bus, not nancy.  heard the new heads rattling away.  so tomorrow
guess i'll check the valves and make sure they are gapped properly.
since i didn't install the heads i don't know if the shop that did set
the valves or not.  should have asked them, i suppose.
hell, i'm just happy and amazed that she turned over and fired at all
considering i put her together, excepting the heads, of course.

eight month sitting and now, soon, i hope, i will be driving her.

jeremiah
