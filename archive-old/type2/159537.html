&gt; The same thing happened to Chris (my fault on the re-assembly). The

&gt; I would replace both.

I replaced both the alt and the VR last night, and the battery and EGR 
lights still flicker increasingly faster as the engine turns faster.  
I'll borrow the battery from the honda tonight and see what that does.  
Any other ideas?
