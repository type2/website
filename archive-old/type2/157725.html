Subject: Save this old bus.

Hello all, I'm new to this email list, but have been on the AIRS list for
a number of years now.  Through some people I know, I was contacted by
another VW bus owner who needs to get rid of his 77-78? Transporter.  He
is going to send this complete bus to the crusher probably within a week
if no one contacts him.  He has no title for this bus.  I know from
experience how hard it is to find parts for these old busses, so I really
would hate to see this going to the crusher.  I wish I had room to store
it. If there is anyone in the Central New York area, or willing to drive
to Waterloo, NY and pickup this bus, please call the owner Chuck (315)
573-4302I've taken the time to upload pics for all to see on the type2
classifieds.  I have more and better pics if neccessary.  Or just email
if you have questions. http://www.type2_dot_com/buysell/carview.php?view=1658
Thanks,Mike   snoop_usa_at_hotmail_dot_com
