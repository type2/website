&lt;&lt; Hey guys   I use to take the oil and battery out of my old bug and place 
them 
behind the wood stove each night , then reinstall them in the morning . 
Worked great it was a little more work but the car would start just fine and 
was 
safer than building a fire under it. later and have fun  mark dearing
 &gt;&gt;

Is that the same Bug Woody Allen will find in a cave 200 years from
now and start right up... ?-)
