Subject: IRC with bus content

Well, I just figured out the esoteric command sequence to get my local
UNIX IRC client to hook up to an irc server OTHER than the default
irc.colorado_dot_edu, and now am online at #buslist on irc.type2_dot_com.  If
anyone wants to chat this morning..or most weekday mornings now that I've
figured out how to get on there...I'll be there.

Bus Content:

On my 73 campmobile, the front brake calipers locked up after the bus had
been sitting for about a year.  I removed the caliper pistons, cleaned it
up really well (did not replace the seals cuz they were in very good
shape) and reinstalled.  When I went to bleed the brakes no amount of
pumping the pedal or vaccuming (with the cool hand pump) was able to get
ANY brake fluid out of the caliper.  The level of the reservoir never
dropped.  I tried for quite some time (a half hour or so) with my well
functioning vaccum pump (I know it works because I'd just bled my Beetle
with it).  Does this sound like a master cylinder?

thanks (and hope to see you chatting)

Jonathan
