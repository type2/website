Subject: [T2] New case or line bore old case?


&gt; I need to line bore the case in my 70 Type2 or buy a new case. It is a
&gt; Mexican case w/80,000 miles installed in 1976. The flywheel main bore is
&gt; .001 out. The case also needs the cylinder spigots resurfaced (&quot;decked&quot;).
My
&gt; existing case is plumbed for a full flow filter using two horizontal oil
&gt; galleys - a difficult operation I would not like to do again.  I have
heard
&gt; that line boring should be avoided.
&gt;
&gt; Any recommendations?

You won't hear that from the bearing manufacturers
who have been supplying replacements for decades.
Try www.geneberg_dot_com for a major complaint.

&gt; Also does anyone know the difference between a $289 case and a $395 case ?

$106 ( plus shipping:)
