I assume the mechanism (is that the window regulator) behind the part

about this job that I should be aware of? Does it operate a cable or
what? Any insight is appreciated.

The Bentley covers this pretty well, actually. Its more a test of
patience than of skill. The regulator is U shaped, and that makes it a
little tricky to get into the door. The crank handle connects to a gear
mechanism that runs up and down a cable of sorts. The little gear thing
can't be replaced independently of the U-cable unless you decide to do
something off-book. 
My only advice would be to get a real good picture in your head (or
digital camera) of what the regulator looks like before you remove it.
My mental picture was blurry from the outset :) There are lots of
things you could get hung-up on while trying to get it back in, and
that's where the patience part comes in. If you know exactly how it
looked before, and how you got it out, &quot;installing by the reverse&quot;
becomes much easier. I guess that applies to anything tho. Any ideas on
fixing the focus on my mental camera? :)

Good luck,
