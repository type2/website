Subject: Wider wheels

Bill:  I know the Vanagon guys have found several Mercedes wheel candidates 
with the correct bolt pattern and a reasonably close offset.  You might check 
with your friendly local boneyard, asking if they have a subscription to 
Hollander.  The Hollander company publishes charts of interchangeability of 
parts -- they helped me when I was thinking about fitting some inexpensive 
(older) MB mags to a Vanagon.  A Google search including &quot;offset&quot; and some 
words about wheels should get you several pages of descriptive material.  Have 
fun...... Glenn

I would like to put wider flatter 15 inch tires on my 73 bus. Does 
anyone know of an existing plain wheel pattern (that does not cost a 
fortune) that will fit so I can put .....say 225\60\15 tires on?
