Hey all,
Not sure if anyone will want these, but I have four &quot;virgin&quot; connecting rods
for a 1600 Type 1 engine that are free to anyone who wants them.  If you
want to put them in your engine all they would need is rebushing the small
end and checking the big end for out of round or taper.  They are all from
the same engine so they are at least within Volkswagen's weight
specification :-)

I'd hate to throw away rebuildable parts, though I realize demand might not
be high, I offer them on the list before I throw them away.  Free to whoever
wants 'em, pick them up or pay shipping.

I would send them back to Larry's for the core charge but it would cost me
more in shipping than I would get from the core charge, so why bother? :-)
