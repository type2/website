Subject: Idle crankcase fumes

Dear list,

At idle crankcase fumes come out under the engine through the lower
portion of the oil filler vent tube. It makes tailgaters believe that
old VW stink or the engine is blowing but i am quite convinced it is
not. It comes out in pulses. Not very big smoke. At night when a car
is stopped behind with the lights on it gets easier to see.

More info
- the engine does not burn oil at freeway speeds
- At about 1500rpm and above the smoking under the engine stops. That
means all the fumes are swallowed via the normal breather path : oil
filler tube-&gt; breather hose -&gt; port inside air cleaner.
- If I put my hand on the intake of the stock oil bath air cleaner at
idle, enough vacuum is created in the oil breather port of the air
cleaner for it to suck all the fumes via the breather. No more fumes
come under
- I tried both connectors for the breather on the oil cooler. With
each port smokes comes out under the engine at idle
- compression is in the 135s all around. 1600cc with 7.55CR. 800 miles
on my baby
- valve covers are new, valve covers surfaces on heads are flat and tight
- valves are at 0.06
- heads were not loose (I found only one of the 8 nuts accessible
without pulling the engine loose). No change after torquing that one
nut. No change after replacing the new valve cover gaskets with newer
ones.
- castor oil 20w50. I am planning to switch to 30w because engine is
new and oil pressure is (really) high enough.
- this seems to have started after I decided to race with a semi. I
did about 3 minutes at 70mph. (and won the semi :)
- oil bath air cleaner has new oil in. Level before flush was normal
- Fumes happen with any oil temp. From 70F to 200F

Found nothing in the archives relevant to this.

thanks
- Arnaud
My friend is looking for a top notch westy with fresh engine and
tranny. Within 100 miles of San Diego. Let me know if you see/have
one. T1 or T4 engine. Not a 1972 or with hatch mod.

Within 1000 miles I'll tell my 20+mpg secret
