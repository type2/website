Subject: re:noisy generator

A while ago (a week or so) someone left a message inquiring about noise
coming from their generator after a pulley broke. Well, I've had this same
problem for a while now, and the solution turned out to be the woodruff key
on the generator shaft. It was a little too small, and was causing play in
the pulley. It seems that the guy I was buying these from after losing many
a key, didn't really think it would make a difference if it was metric or
standard. After going to a local VW shop to get the correct key, it works
fine (no more pulleys falling to pieces).
