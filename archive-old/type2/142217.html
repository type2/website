Subject: RE: [T2] RE: Type 1 Engine in a Type 4 Bus

Courtney, the gearing in my '77 Kombi was stock and it had no problem
climbing hills, usually in third on the real steep climbs. I cruise at
65-70 mph on the highway, this seems to be where it is happiest. It has
been mentioned elsewhere that the later transmissions input shaft is too
long. This is true, but the splines are in the same place, so I just
ground off 1/2&quot; and dressed it a bit with sandpaper. I did not change
the starter and it also worked fine. I believe the later starter has
smaller teeth, I have over 100,000 miles on the conversion with no
problems. Hey Kevin, the Luau's booked and the Hula girls can't wait to
meet you! :^) laters,Timo
