Subject: Re: Engine Stand Question

&gt;I'm going to be doing my first rebuild this winter on a 1500 H series
&gt;motor for my 65 Deluxe Bus. For the home rebuilder does anyone have any
&gt;comments on the engine stand model that bolts to a workbench -
&gt;specifically the JCWhitney model. Is it satisfactory or should I spend a
&gt;little more for a free-standing one. The cost for this bench mount model
&gt;is only $23.98 on sale now. I'd like any input/advice before I order it.

In Detroit-think, engine stands are extremely useful because they let you
turn the block upside-down. We're talking 500-750 lbs maybe? I have one out
there in the carport with an I6 bolted to it and it's a great help. But in
VW-speak, I don't know what possible good an engine stand could do you.
Your case will weigh maybe 30 lbs. You want a big flat bench, maybe 4x4
feet, covered with something you can keep clean. With a decent vise
attached to it.

If you've worked on a monoblock, Nathan, and then you take one of these
apart and put it back together...that's when it hits you, that's when
you'll really understand. That's when the phenomenal genius of this engine
becomes clear. It is so light you can carry its essence around in your two
hands, yet it can power a 5000 pound bus...

Anyway an engine stand is the last thing I would spend $25 plus freight on.
Think &quot;plywood&quot;. ;)
