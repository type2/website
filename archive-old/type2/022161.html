Subject: Fwd: '81 Vanagon timing woes
Message-Id: &lt;4.1.19990516090450.00a8e750_at_pop-2.iastate_dot_edu&gt;

Now I'm wondering if I'm looking at the correct timing notch... from
earlier posts I've learned that the timing indicator is a small notch in
the pulley (which looks like someone took a hacksaw to it).  I've found a
couple of these 'notches' on my pulley... which one is correct?  One I
found was on the outer diameter of the pulley on the front side of the belt
(front of course being toward the front of the vanagon).  The other is on
the backside of the belt on the outer diameter of the pulley.  Does anyone
with a similar vehicle know if one of these 'notches' is the correct timing
indicator???
  
&gt;I just installed a new (used) distributor in my '81 Vanagon (california)... 
&gt;timing is specified as 5 deg ATDC at 850-950 rpm.  I can't seem to even get 
&gt;it close to this range.  I've followed the instructions in Bentley on 
&gt;adjusting the timing, but as I gradually approach the spec'd value my idle 
&gt;speed drops drastically (idle speed adjustment is already near max).  Any 
&gt;ideas or help here??
&gt;
