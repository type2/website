Subject: Re: [T2] Going Camping for the first time questions

Hi David,

Rule #1 = DON'T PANIC.

Sorry to burst your bubble, but 320 miles is not all that long a  
distance for a VW bus. I usually don't sweat the distance for a trip  
unless I have to start saving up for gas money.

If you're driving long distances at highway speeds, don't try to take  
the hills at 75MPH. if the bus wants to slow down, let it. That's  
what the slow lanes are for. Pushing hard on hills will raise head  
temps and that can cause valve/seat issues. If you can afford the  
extra $100 it might be a good idea to have a CHT gauge installed.

What to bring: A camera, as the fall colours up there should be good.  
You'll want memories from the first bus camp. A very basic tool-kit  
will handle the minor details, and you have AAA for anything major.

ENJOY!


Happy Trails,

Greg Potts
