Subject: Repro of original 1960's dealer cartoon book

Hi all.=20
    If I remember correctly there was some earlier discussion of a =
cartoon book from the dealers that was available in the 60's. I happen =
to have one VERY mint copy of this book in my possession from Norm =
Bishop VW that was here in Boise ID in the late 50's to early 70's. I am =
considering reproducing it for our local club &quot;The Bus Pilots =
Association&quot; (BPA). The reproduction is just that, not a photo copy but =
a printed repro on 80 and 100 pound paper with an exact match of color, =
size etc.=20
      My goal is that when it's all done I won't be able to tell the new =
ones from the original (no intention to defraud anyone just that I think =
its important to preserve our heritage and share cool stuff with our =
fellow VW owners) Anyway to do this economically we need to order a =
minimum of 100 copies at a cost of around $15 each + maybe .50 to mail =
U.S. If some one is outside the US and wants a copy we'll work it out on =
a case by case basis.
. Would any one like one of these IF we were to do this ??? If I get =
enough interest We'll do it but I need to act fast as the original is on =
loan from a non-VW enthusiast who would prefer not to part with it.!!!!!

PS would some one please forward this to the VintagVw list or any other =
groups that might be interested as I have not had time to get back on =
that list since my move.
