Subject: emissions retrofit...

Hello List,

let me know if this is possible.

I am looking into getting a '86 vanagon syncro that has a bad
(water-cooled) motor.
I have a good running 1800cc at home (the backup for my '74, which has
a very solid 2000cc).
The 1800cc from a '75 bus, fuel injected, very complete including the
EGR system.

I was thinking, I'll just throw the 1800cc in the vanagon. As this has
always been my VW approach... but then my father pointed out that the
vanagon would need to pass Massachusetts emissions... something I've
never had to worry about. Mass. requires all '84  and newer vehicles
to pass emissions....

                  Hydrocarbons Carbon Monoxide Oxides of Nitrogen
1984  1990    2.0               30.0                 3.0


What would I have to do to get that motor to pass this emissions
check? Could I simply add a catalytic converter? (it currently has the
'72-'74 exhaust, which would probably need to be swapped out to make
this work). I've heard horror stories of people fighting with the
emissions folks in California... I don't think Massachusetts is nearly
as strict.... I've gotten a sticker many times where I shouldn't have
and the inspector knew I shouldn't have.

I know far less about vanagons than I do about busses.... but I figure
I gotta learn at some point...

Would the easier approach be to change the VIN plate and register it
as an '83? :)

thanks
eddie
