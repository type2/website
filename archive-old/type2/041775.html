Hey Robb,
Thanks for the quick reply.  Actually, though, I was looking for the
opposite.  I know it's crazy, but I really don't care about
power(kinda).  I'm actually looking for better milage.  I don't want to
just blindly start leaning out the mixture, though, because I'm afraid
that I'll overheat the engine, so I want to know what CO limits I should
look for when I'm adjusting the internal workings of the AFM.

And I don't plan on drilling the AFM any time soon, I was just curious
if anyone had ever thought about it :)

Later,
Mike

&gt; Mike, first off, the K&amp;N is a good mod. I've been running one on my ' 78
&gt; westy for a few years.Yes, people on the list will scream that the sky is
&gt; falling when you mention K&amp;N filters, or anything else that isn't at least 30
&gt; years old. Pay them no mind. If they have a problem with my thought process,
&gt; they can find me at HCBF, at the end of July. I'm the 210lb. extensivly
&gt; tatooed guy with Masters in ME, a pristine ' 78 Delux Westy, and an attitude
&gt; problem.( its hard to Always be right.) Secondly, don't drill holes in the
&gt; AFM flap. It'll just give you a &quot;False Air&quot; problem. You can pop the top off
&gt; of said AFM, and loosen the tention spring one notch to let you mixture
&gt; richen up a bit quicker, but you're gonna need a rising rate fuel pressure
&gt; regulator or Bosch injectors with higher flow rate to get any appreciable hp
&gt; gains. Both come with their own set of problems. And the AFM idle CO mixture
&gt; screw you were talking about is just that. It works at idle speed only. You
&gt; can play with it all you want, but at anything over 1200rpm, it becomes
&gt; useless.
