Subject: Re: [T2] dashboards

Speaking of dashboards.  I was looking to do some
customizing and tweaking of a dashboard for a 74 Bay
Bus.  I eventually want to replace my original as it
is very worn and cracked and down right ugly.  

I was thinking of going with just painted metal
instead of the Vinyl &amp; Foam, or something, either way
i wanna do some expirmenting, and see what my little
brain can dream up.  However, excellence cannot be
ruched and I need my Bus to get around.  So, I need a
spare to do my stuff, sadly Minnesota is rather devoid
of any good Boneyards for VWs to my knowledge.  So if
anyone can spare one, or can scrounge one up for me, I
would be more than willing to compensate said
individual for their part, time &amp; Shipping etc... It
just needs to be solid metal wise, otherwise any shape
will do.  Or anyone from Minnesota or nearby has a
lead where I could find good used VW parts please let
me know.  

Thanks.
