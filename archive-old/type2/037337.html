Subject: Wanted:'80-83 Westfalia

Well, I'm finally going to sell &quot;Helmut&quot;...my '71 weekend camper after
owning it for 12yrs (3d owner-the other two owners were engineer buddies
and both anal about maintenance and keeping records...just like me).

MSHP is building me a 2.4L six-stud type4 engine so now I'm looking for a
clean, well maintained '80-83 Vanagon Westfalia that I can drop this killer
engine into and drive off into the sunset.

Anyone know of one? You can call me Martin (818) 848-5999 (office)

Thanks,
Martin
