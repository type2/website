Subject: We are home again after meeting Inuvik Trekers.

Hello Everyone,
     Well our trip with the rest of the Inuvik expedition ended sooner
than we thought it would.  We were setting our sites on Prince George as a
turn around point, but we were over heating before we even got to
Lilloouet. It was 4:00 PM, over 90 F and at least 5 hours of driving lay
ahead of us to make it to the first scheduled camp site, we decided to
find a lake and call it a day and a trip. I believe at this point we were
probably an hour behind the rest of the group. I'm sorry we were not
better prepared to make this long first day, Heidi, the kids, and I should
have taken off the day before and made the first day a two day trip, but
then we would not have gotten to go to the party and spend a beautiful day
in Vancouver.  I'm so glad I got to meet so many of the V_at_l and Type2
Internet list people.  I even got to talk to Uncle Joel at the party, he
called to talk to the people going on the trip. I enjoyed spending time
with everyone, this is a diverse group of people. Thank you all, for
allowing us to take part to the best of our ability.

        Thank You.
        johnny Stutsman
