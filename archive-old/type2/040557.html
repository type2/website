Subject: Does Anyone Have a VW For Sale?..1970 van in FL F/S

Tim or anyone... I have a pretty solid 1970 bus for sale in Northern 
Florida, but it doesnt have an engine right now. If anyone wants to see pic 
of the bus, go to this site: Its $600 as is for now until I find an 
engine,or do more work on it.Then the price will be more. Front floors had 
just a little rust. They have been coated with Ospho, primer and paint.  If 
anyone has an engine for sale thats semi close, drop me a line with the 
info.

&gt;
&gt;Hello,
&gt;    Does anyone out there know about or own a VW bus
&gt;that they would sell in the Maryland area?  I have
&gt;been looking for one for a long time and have no luck.
&gt;  I would like it to be in OK condition-running a
&gt;little rust.  Thanks a lot for your help.  I had a few
&gt;respond on my other ? and this list is great.
&gt;
&gt;Thanks again.
&gt;
&gt;Peace,
&gt;Tim Hayes
