Subject: Squealing rear brakes

I've tried to fix the squeal in my right, rear brake 4 different times
now.  I installed new shoes (that's when the problem started, more or
less), replaced all the clips (3 different times), and have cleaned,
greased, adjusted, re-cleaned, adjusted, greased, etc. and the damn
squeal just won't go away!

Now, before you start sending me suggestions on how to fix it, let me
tell you this last symptom that I just discovered last night:  I had my
wife drive slowly while I went in the back and opened the sliding door
so I could listen more carefully to the squeal.  Boy was I surprised to
discover all the sound from the rear brake coming from the FRONT!!!

&quot;CRAP&quot; I says (actually, I said a lot more than that).  &quot;I've been
'fixing' the wrong freakin brake for the last 2 months!&quot;

So tonight, I pull the front pads and re-pooky (technical term for disc
brake anti-squeal stuff) the shims to the pads.  I have no doubt that
will fix my squealing rear brake problem.

If I had any artistic talent, I'm sure I could create a new comic strip
based solely on the antics of my own shade-tree mechanicing (sp?)
