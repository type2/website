$135.59 (w/shipping) United Kingdom Pounds = $195.92 U.S. (w/shipping)
is what I paid for both halves together. Got them shipped to Auburn, ME. A 
lot cheaper than some other (unnamed) places in England that had them. Took 
about 5-6 weeks, but I got them (not too banged up, the corners were a 
little bent, but nothing a pair of pliers couldnt straighten out. Not a bad 
deal. Havent gotten around to installing them so I cant comment on the fit 
(yet) :-)
