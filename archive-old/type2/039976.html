&quot;1.  I noticed on a web page (can't remember where) that someone had a
really
cool Westy pop top tent that was rainbow colored.  Anyone know who sells
such tents?&quot;

Justin,
That may have been my page. The canvas isn't actually a rainbow, but  red,
green, and blue stripes, with gold in between. Then again, maybe there's
another multicolored striped poptop tent out there. Anyway, it's a product
of PLF VW (I got it before Dawn had her problems, don't know her current
status, does anyone know?).
