&gt;  Hello all!
&gt; 
&gt;  Getting close to the time when Im going to have to
&gt; reinstall the interior
&gt;  in my 70 westy.  I went to the local lumber yards
&gt; looking for the thin birch
&gt;  paneling for the sides and the ceiling panels. 
&gt; They didnt have anything 
&gt;  that came close to the thickness I need.  The
&gt; closest they had was twice as
&gt;  thick as I need and that stuff will never bend, yet
&gt; alone fit into the 
&gt;  channels.  Am I looking at the right places?  Mabee
&gt; I dont know what it 
&gt;  Im looking for.
&gt; 
&gt;  Any help is alway appreciated!
