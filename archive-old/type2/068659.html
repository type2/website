Subject: Ian are you still looking for a motor?

Ian
        seems you're still having a lot of problems with sending and
receiving mail. I've been trying to get in touch with you in regards to
your hunt for a replacement engine. I've got a couple of leads here in
Copenhagen, you might want to follow up on. If you're still looking give me
a call.
