&gt; &gt;  From your description the most likely explanation is an obstruction in

&gt; &gt; passage through to the venturi. Unless your progressive is constructed
&gt; &gt; differently to mine, there is no way to disassemble this area. You will
&gt; &gt; need to blow, soak or poke out the obstruction. You need to consider that
&gt; &gt; the hole is smaller at the venturi end so you may jam the obstruction in
&gt; &gt; harder by blowing from the outside!
&gt;
&gt;Does soaking with a solvent then trying to suck it out make sense?
&gt;(besides the obvious risks of either killing brain cells, or blowing
&gt;  up the vacuum cleaner).

That sounds like a good approach as the material may be well and truly 
gummed in!

&gt;Is there a cut away diagram anywhere that will let me see what I will
&gt;damage when I resort to poking needles into it?

I don't know of one and I'd use a fine wire rather than a needle.

Cheers,

Martin
