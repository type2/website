pulled the plug on this outing

&gt; jamie interjected ,
&gt; check this link for more information,, time, and route subject to change, and
&gt; will be updated here till 2 hrs before departure
&gt; http://www.globalserve_dot_net/~jrivers/falltour2001.htm
&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
&gt; 
&gt; There are six buses attending, and more are welcome.  We're starting at
&gt; Rattlesnake Point Conservation area at 8:30 AM, weather permitting. With the
&gt; leaves in full autumn glory up here, it should be a good trip, and the
&gt; scenery and small towns on the route will make for some great pictures.
&gt; 
&gt; The &quot;Backbone of Ontario&quot; is actually the Niagara Escarpment, it runs from
&gt; Niagara Falls all the way up the Bruce Peninsula to Tobermorey. Bring a CB
&gt; radio or Walky-talky if you have one, the Carabus will be communicating on
&gt; channel 14.
&gt; 
&gt; Let Jamie jrivers_at_globalserve_dot_net or I know via P-Mail if you're interested or
&gt; want more details.
&gt; Check http://www.hrca.on_dot_ca/rattle.html for more details on where we're
&gt; meeting, and a look at the scenery and colours to look forward to.
&gt; 
&gt; Happy trails,

&gt; 
&gt; I am pretty busy at this time of year,, But I thought it would be cool to
&gt; drive
&gt; the Vw for a small tour of Southern Ontario
&gt; 
&gt; I plan on starting at Rattlesnake lookout, small entry cost
&gt; http://www.hrca.on_dot_ca/rattle.html
&gt; as they open at 08:30
&gt; 
&gt; Then driving along the Niagara Escarpment, catching some scenery etc.
&gt; It seems to work great if you pack a lunch that can be eaten while driving,
&gt; or a
&gt; short stop to prepare it co-ordinated with a pee break or gas stop ,, or
&gt; both
&gt; 
&gt; We might make it as far away from the start as Wiarton, or Collingwood,,,
&gt; 
&gt; Some folks might take the tour, then scream home for the night,, some might
&gt; decide to campout,, or what ever.
&gt; 
&gt; I would plan on cooking dinner at a campsite, a campfire,, some BS'n,, and
&gt; talk
&gt; about sunday's plan... breakfast,, and make it home for lunch via the scenic
&gt; route
&gt; 
&gt; So.. If your up for a impromptu country drive,, along some secondary roads,,
&gt; I
&gt; am purposely going to avoid the traverses up and down the actual escarpment
&gt; this
&gt; time! .....
&gt; Let me know that you plan on coming
&gt; 
&gt; If you have a map of ontario,, look at the Bruce trail, and see if there are
&gt; any
&gt; points of interest along the way you might want to see or do!
&gt; 
&gt; Jamie Rivers
&gt; weather permitting,, I am not going if it is raining
