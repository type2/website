Clara asked:

BTW, anyone ever find a list of what colours VW used for wheels and bumpers?  

VanBondo says:
Yes, 
L-82 Silver White.
Have your paint person look way in the back of the PPG book. there is a
cross ref for other paints and modern code/formulas.
(This is more of a Appliance white with an &quot;RCH&quot; of blue in it.) Um- er,
would you believe &quot;Real Close Height???&quot; Ah, didn't think so... The silver
white is not the same as the pearl and cloud white that ended up on the top
half of 2-toned buses. A lot of folks have simply used the white on the top
half of the bus just to save having to buy more paint. In my opinion, I
think the Silver makes the other colors &quot;snap&quot; a tad better.
