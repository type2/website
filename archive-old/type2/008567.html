Subject: gas line residue

I walked out to get in the Dormobile two days ago and noticed a black puddle
under the tranny.  I stuck my finger in it, smelled like varnish, was thick
and blacker than the oil I currently have in. (recent oil change)
I crawled underneath and check the locations of the tranny seals and CV
boots, all were dry.  Puddle was too far forward to be engine oil.  I drove
to work and made sure I parked in a dry spot.  At lunch there was another
smaller puddle, this time it smelled like gas.  Cool, I knew what to do now.
I got home, found the gas dripping from the fuel line about six inches from
the tank.  I cut off the six inches and had enough slack to reattach it
without stretching.  
I figure the gas broke down the ashphalt with the first puddle and that's
what threw me with the thick black appearance.
Here's a question though;
I changed the fuel line last March when installing the new engine, used new
German braided fuel line, no clamps.  Why would this line would fail, it
wasn't stressed or rubbing on anything.  It also had a white semi crystaline
build up, about a 1/4 inch ball, on the outside of the hose within an inch
of the tank.  
Any comments on either of these two issues?  
thanks,
