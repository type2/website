Subject: RE: [T2] CV Boots

  I still sell German axle boots but prefer to sell EMPI boots, made in the
U S A.
Most of the so called German boots are repackeaged Brazil (Febi/bilstein is
one example) Meisterstatz still appear to be German and get good life from
them. For those that don't know EMPI is one of the largest OE supplier and
after market supplier of CV boots in the country. Their boots are
manufactured here in the U S, I have been to there plant and watched them
make them! They also manufacture CV joints and axles in house. Their CV
joints (type 1 and 2) are made part in the U S and part in their OWN factory
in Taiwan and assemblied in the U S. Their type 2 CV joints have been and
are currently being tested on Formula Mazda race cars and have had a lower
failure rate then Lobro C V joints which I also believe are now outsourced
from Lobro and not Made in Germany any longer (thus a much lower price now).
The world market, we all know what's happening

These are US-made boots of modern design.  I've found them to be more
durable than Lobro or Qualitat boots.
