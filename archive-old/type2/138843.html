1.9V per cell is dead so that would be 11.4 volts total if all the cells
were evenly dead.
 
&gt; 11.5 volts should keep you rolling down the road after start though -- so
&gt; cutting out after it got started indicates something wrong in the charging

&gt; If it still doesn't start then move on from there.

Until the alternator kicks in the FI system is going to be disadvantaged by
the low battery.
