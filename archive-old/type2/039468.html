&gt;this may sound like a naive question.  i am in putting new pistons and

&gt;i have to take them apart and use a ring compressor or can i just put them 
&gt;on together without taking them apart?  id appreciate the help.

Kind of a loaded question.  I've always just put them on, but I was in 
direct disagreement with the venerable Bob Hoover who has stated that you 
must disassemble them, clean everything thoroughly, then reassemble.  The 
main reason I have never done that is for fear of breaking a ring - they 
are fragile (AMHIK).  I don't remember hearing a lot of other opinions on 
this subject in the past - I'm glad you brought it up.  Opinions, anyone?

I have 75k miles now on a set of Cofap pistons/liners that I installed 
without disassembly/cleaning.  The results are inconclusive - my 
compression is a tad low in one cylinder (105 vs. 120 in the others) and 
there is some blowby, although the amount has remained constant (and more 
or less manageable) since I put the engine together about four years ago.
