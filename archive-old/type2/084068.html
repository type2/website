Subject: Pop top for Westy for FREE

I have a pop top just taking up space and it has to go very soon. If you
need it please Email me directly. You will have to come get it in
Northern Arizona because it is too large to ship. Hate the idea of
putting it out for the trash pickup.
Thanks and hope this will complete someone's project,
Tom
