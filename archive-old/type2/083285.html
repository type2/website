&gt; It was running good heading south but started to miss as I approached

&gt; out to get any clearance. I decided to stay with the gruop and made it
&gt; to Ebus. Steve Dolan confirmed the prob and I was able to make it home
&gt; again.(southern Ontario, 850 miles).

Phil,

Credit where credit is due... I think it was Jamie Rivers who confirmed
