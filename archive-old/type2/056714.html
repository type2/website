Mark,

There is no interior mechanism, from the factory, but it is easy and much
safer to have one.  This is especially true if you do any camping in the
bus!  

The latch works by being pushed by the button on the outside, but it can
also be pulled.  VW, anticipating this (tho never using it, AFAIK) 
drilled a couple of holes in the latch arm.  If you take a piece of wire
and thread it thru a hole in the latch arm, then drill a hole in your new
panel and feed the wire thru the hole in the panel, you have a way of
escaping the van for whatever reason (fire, gotta go in the middle of the
night, a sudden and tremedous stench in the bus :-)  If you put a finger
loop on the wire sticking thru the hole, it's even more convenient!

In theory, there is no difference between theory and practice. 
But, in practice, there is.
