Subject: Re: Winter gas mileage

I am experiencing the same thing.  The summer and winter temps here (Chico, CA)
are very similar to what David describes and I've dropped from 16/17 mpg this
summer to 13/14 mpg this winter.  I'm hoping it has something to do with the gas
and not with my bus.

&gt; Has anyone else noticed a significant drop in gas mileage with colder weather?

&gt; I am averaging 14mpg in mixed city/freeway driving lately.  I
&gt; know that the increased use of the chokes accounts for some of it.
&gt;
&gt; For reference, my typical summer environment is 80-100 degrees F, and
&gt; typical winter environment is 30-50 degrees F.  I usually average about
&gt; 16mpg in the same driving conditions in the summer.
