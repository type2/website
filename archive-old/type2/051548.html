Subject: [T2] Towing A VW

Howdy Folks,

The wife and I have discussed it and determined that since we intend to keep
Bess until it will no longer physically roll, we've come to the logical
conclusion that we will most likely tow her or someone else's bus again (and
again) in the future.

So, I'm trying to decide what kind of a tow bar to get.  I've seen several
that hook in to the tow hooks already on the Bus.  There are many that hook
into the bumper!  And finally, I've heard about some that fit onto the
cross-beam.

Any reccomendations on which way to go here?  Is the bumper strong enough to
use for pulling?   Are the tow hooks strong enough?

I would appreciate your input!

Thanks,

Darrin K. Pierce
