As for bus features:

Don't forget the new fresh air intakes to totally ventilate you bus in
the most efficient way possible!  All it takes is a little water in the
right places, let set and let rust!  A good addendum to this fresh air
sysytem is the deletion of any and all seals on the doors and windows! 
Works Great!
