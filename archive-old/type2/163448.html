Karl,
With all due respect, I thought the whole point of a  list like this
one was to not throw &quot;you should take it to the shop&quot; in  each  other's
face.

Working  on AC systems is not something you do in your driveway if you have 
zero tools  or knowledge.

Not sure where you live, but here in California you have  be licensed to buy 
R-12.

In your case, you are going to spend more on  tools and a vacuum pump to do 
something once than you would spend
to have a  professional do it right.

Don't get insulted, but you don't have a clue  as to what you are doing. You 
need to go to city college and
take a course  on auto AC systems. I have been fixing cars for 40 years and 
even though basic  AC is the same,
systems change every year.




hello Arnaud   Karl is right on this unless you plan on doing a  lot of AC 
work, Sometimes the smart thing to do is to let the pros do it for  you. I sub 
out all my non Vw exhust work cause the guys I got doing it do it  everyday and 
can do the whole job cheaper than I can buy the parts. I do the  same with 
alignment and tires.  later  Mark Dearing  Salem Import  Service  salem Va
