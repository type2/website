At a local bugfest here in the Chicago area I saw  a '71 bus and a '71 Westy
with LP heaters (RV types).  Installations on both were neat and since these
are similar to the furnace in my pop-top camper trailer, I know they work.
What are the experiences/opinions of the group re. these, especially  about
using them while driving.  In the RV world there are greatly differing
opinions about having the LP going when on the road.  The bigger rigs have
fridges that run either on LP or 120V, so I wonder if they have emergency
shut-off switches similar to the systems on my cars (both with FI) which
would shut of the gas supply in event of crash.  Again, any opinions or
experience?

Thanks

Allen Jordan
