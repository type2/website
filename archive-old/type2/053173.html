Personally, I weld a 1&quot; tab of flat stock to one of the sides of the head.
A piece of 1/8&quot; steel, 1&quot; long and 1/2&quot; wide works dandy.  Then wrap
a layer  or two of duct tape to the shank of the bolt to keep it from
sliding back thru when you are trying to get the nut started.

&gt; to keep the halfmoon engine bolt from turning? Ever since I rebuilt the 
&gt; starter and cleaned up the trans, the bolt wants to turn.
