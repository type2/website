Subject: Re: [T2] Cyl Head temperature Sensors

&gt; &gt;  do ALL 1.8s have the cyl head temperature sensor holes?

&gt; I'd have to go and look, but the book might be talking about the temp
 sensor for the FI system that is placed right next to where the intake
 runners connect to the head. Not sure if you could get a head temp
 sensor (like for a gauge) to hook there.


 You are thinking of 2.0 heads..... 1.8 FI heads have the sensor above #3 intake port. If you look at just
about all [except 79 and up] 3/4 upper cylinder tin, you will see a rubber plug in a 1&quot; hole above #3 intake.
That is where the 1.8 sensor goes. A major PITA to change! The hole in the head is on a 45 degree angle.
The only pic in the Bentley about the sensor is in section 10, page 15, figure 4-12. It is only a drawing but
it is the 1.8 sensor, not the 2.0. Look at the angle and the cooling fins.....
