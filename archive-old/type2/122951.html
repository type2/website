Subject: fog lights

I have these fog cutters I am going to put on the duck and was wondering
If I should run a new wire to the back with an inline fuse and bypass all 
the
old wiring in the bus (78).  I'm not sure how much more current I would
feel comfy sending through the existing fuse box.  I was considering 
actually
mounting a new fusebox for new accesories as I come about them.

Is this a waste or time and wiring or does it sound like the safe thing to 
do.
Im not sure of the wattage of the foglights but they are supposed to be
pretty decent units.

James
