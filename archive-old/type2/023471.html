Subject: Need help identifying a piston, please
To: type2_at_lenti.type2_dot_com

I am reworking my son's 1800 T4 engine. It has one odd piston in a set of 
otherwise good pistons. If some kind lister could help me identify this, I'd 
be appreciative. I want to try to find a &quot;matching&quot; good used one.

The piston is a 93 mm &quot;Standard&quot;. The only identifying mark is inside the 
piston, about on hte level of the pin bosses, and 90 degrees off the pin 
axis. The casting mark is a large letter C with an elongated letter S inside 
the C.There are steel inserts cast in around the bosses, each extending 
approximately (a guess) 140 degrees. On the circumference of the piston, on 
each side level with the bosses, there are two holes, one either side of the 
boss, which allow the steel inserts to show.

The crown of the piston is recessed concentrically. The center flat 
(depressed) is appx. 28mm, and the outer flat ring is appx. 12mm across. 
Between the outer flat and the center flat, the slope is straight, and the 
depression appears to be about 4mm deep.

Sound familiar to anyone???
