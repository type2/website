Subject: [Re: T2] update: symptoms... now no spark

&gt;They had some sort of film on them keeping them
from making a connection. I &quot;fixed&quot; mine by using a&lt;

I always clean new points with brake clean or carb cleaner before
installing. They have a protective coating to keep them from rusting on the
shelf.

&lt;A multi meter is very handy when dignosing these
problems. check to make sure that your are getting 12v
to the coil when the key is in the ON position.&lt;

I use a simple test light. If you have 12v at the + side of the coil thats
good. Then test it at the - side while you r buddy trys to start the
engine. The test light should blink as the points do their thing. No blinks
no points. 12v at the + means your sysytem is getting fed the juice to do
its thing. I have gotten bad points before and had to replace them.
