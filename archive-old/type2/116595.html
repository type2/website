Subject: Re:Early detection of fire in engine compartment

Jeff,

As a Nicet certified technician in fire alarm system design and a bus driver, I guess it'd be hard to get more interested than me.

Except for people whose vehicles are actually on fire at the present moment.

What've you got in mind?

How are you gonna deal with false alarms?

Billy

&gt;I am wondering if there would be any interest in a &gt;system that would alert the driver to the presence &gt;of fire in the engine compartment?
