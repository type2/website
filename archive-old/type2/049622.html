Hi volks,

	I was going to let this one go by. I must have posted on every 
damn tyre thread since I joined the original vanagon list soon after 
inception... :-(

 The confusion is caused by differing standards between Europe &amp; the
US and between the '70s and today. There is one INTERNATIONAL standard
that will tell you what you need to know: the &quot;Load Index&quot; of the tyre
which is printed on them all. Here's a chart:
http://www.tireguides_dot_com/tip2.html

 Make sure your tyre has at least a &quot;95&quot; in the index and you'll be
safe. Higher numbers give you more safety margin, stiffer sidewalls,
better stability and a rougher ride (and cost more, usually).

 If the tyre you are looking at doesn't have a load index moulded
onto the sidewall then I strongly suggest you RUN AWAY. The only
thing between you and a 38 tonner at a giveway is four little 
patches of rubber.

 By all means, check the library, search the archives, post on 
brands and models but remember that if it isn't a &quot;95&quot; or more
then VW didn't think it was up to the job, and neither does most
of &quot;the list&quot;.
 Sizes you can come &amp; go on- they may fit, they may not; they may
affect your gearing, or your speedo but they probably won't 
kill you. Load ratings matter: don't rely on getting lucky.

Cheers,
	 W.

PS Archive search hint: for tyres read tires.
