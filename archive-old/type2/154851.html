Subject: RE: [T2] Steering box question

Jules,

The 73-79 Steering box will not swap into the 68-72. It requires cutting the
frame rail and is not practical.

Try doing the Bentley adjustment and see if it helps. Also check your grease
or oil level.

You can get a decent used box, but it is 50/50 that it will be better than
yours.

The only real fix available in the US is a busboys (www.bus-boys_dot_com)
rebuilt unit. They are like new and I recently swapped one in my 68 DC.
Drives like new and comes with special grease. Even though pricey, it is an
important safety item and 100% worth it.

Hi,

I see that the 68-72 and 73-79 use different steering boxes. Is the
later model retro-fitable to my '71?

Found a tight spot in my steering - I'm sure it will drive fine for a
while longer but figured I'd better start shopping around, just in
case.

Anyone have a 68-72 box in good shape they would care to part with?

Thanks
Jules
