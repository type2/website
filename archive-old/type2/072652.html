Subject: louvered/jalousie windows
Message-Id: &lt;v01530500b328166d41e8_at_[204.221.85.125]&gt;

Hi, I have a '69 camper with sliding windows (that don't slide.) I was
thinking of putting louvered/jalousie windows in.  Is this a good idea &amp;
will they fit?  I looked through the archives, but it seems that no one
sells the windows?   If anyone knows where I could get the louvered windows
for the cargo door &amp; the other side of the bus I'd really appreciate it.

Also, just want to thank everyone for all the help they've been sending my way.

Thank you,
Keri
