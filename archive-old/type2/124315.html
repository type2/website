Subject: using oil cooler for inside heat

&gt;I'm wondering if you could use the rear heater setup from a water 
&gt;cooled vanagon.  That would sure make it convenient.  Just substitute 
&gt;the oil cooler for the Vanagon heater core or maybe even use the 
&gt;heater core.

No, Nope,Nada,Nein

the oil is under high pressure

the water is barely under any pressure at all,
the water heater core will develope huge oil leaks
because it was not designed to hold such high pressure
