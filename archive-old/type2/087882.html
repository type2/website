&gt; From: myangelmorgan_at_juno_dot_com
&gt; like when i am trying to USE the entrance ramp to gain speed and the
*^%$^%*&amp;^
&gt; in front of me waits til the END of the ramp to figure out where their
accelerator 
&gt; pedal is... i get so frustrated that i end up pushing my bus way
harder than i should,
&gt; trying to get around them. 

My solution, which may not apply to all personalities: if I'm entering a
freeway and the driver in front of me isn't using the on-ramp properly,
I'll slow to a crawl at the TOP of the ramp and wait until they're out
of the way, then use the full length of the ramp to accelerate to
freeway speed and execute a proper merge.  It's a lot cleaner than
trying to make my Bus do something that's not in its blood.  I'm
guessing that this procedure also greatly reduces the chance of leaving
one's legs in the next guy's trunk on the way to the hospital.

Hope this helps,

- Miles
