Do you or anyone you know need parts from a 1977 baywindow passenger bus?

as far as I can tell, it's all there except the engine.

It has an automatic transmission. front seats have been replaced with
aftermarket seats, middle and rear are there and in decent condition.

There is no title, but there is a bill of sale.  the guy selling it had
the title, but lost it before he got the chance to transfer it to his name
and now he needs to sell it.  It can probably be had for under $500, maybe
I can talk him down.  He has something else that I want, I think I can
talk him into a package deal...

Know anyone who would be interested? parts or all?

Alan
