Has anyone heard of a brand of tires named &quot;WooSung&quot; and made in Korea.
I
stopped by an independent truck tire dealer and asked if he had any
195R14,
load range D tires. He said that they had just imported a container of
tires
and had 185 and 195 R 14 in a load range D, Max load 1875_at_65psi cold.
Salesman said that they were a great tire and the price ($60.00 each
everything included) was because they had imported a whole container and
thus had quantity pricing. (what else would he say) Anyone ever had any
experience with this make and are there any other questions I should
ask? As
always, the wisdom of the list is invaluable.TIA TBear

There are a couple of very important questions to ask: On the sidewall
what is the tread life, traction and temperature. This will be a number
and 2 letters: something line 320, A, B.
Do they have a guaranteed trad life?
I have never heard of these tires but they sound ok, though Korean tires
do not have the best reputation.
