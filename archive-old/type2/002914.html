On the Type 4 powered 2 liter 1980 and up, there is one pulley that goes
behind the fan, and another pulley that attaches to a idler bracket.  and
the pulley on the end of the compressor.  3 pulleys, that have grooves for
two belts.  I have never seen a working setup, and the etka is not a lot of
help on this one.

On my 73 a/c system, no idler pulley just one that went strat to another
pulley behind the fan.

&gt; &gt;If so, and if you have a digital camera, I am dying to know where this
idler
&gt; &gt;pulley assembly goes.  The PO removed it to put new bearings in, and
never
&gt; &gt;reinstalled it or the a/c compressor, thus my current situation!
&gt;
&gt; I don't understand your question.  Are you talking about a type4-powered
&gt; bus?  A type 4 car (hopefully not since this is a bus list)?  The bus
&gt; installation has no idler pulley for the A/C.  If your bracket has an
idler
&gt; pulley attached, it did not originally come from a bus.  My '73 Capri had
&gt; such a pulley though.
