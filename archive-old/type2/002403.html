Check the little lock lever on the inside of the sliding door latch

&gt;&gt;  I was checking to make sure my all my door locks
worked on my 71 bus.  I went to lock my sliding door
and it locked fine.  When I went to unlock it, uh oh.
I can't get it unlocked? Does any one know how I can
get it unlocked and what is wrong with it?  &lt;&lt;
