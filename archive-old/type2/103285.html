Subject: Re: [T2] `77 Gas cap

&gt;&gt;  Bus Depot sells a really nice German locking cap for $16.

Yes, and the original VW gas cap on the left has an 'impossible to find' key 
blank.  I bought a blank from a VW dealership, and they charged me $6 just 
for an uncut blank.

Better to get the one from Bus Depot, because you WILL make another key or 
two.  It is really bad ju-ju to lose your key ring with ignition key and gas 
cap key, and not have a spare set hidden somewhere on the VW.  Then your are 
stuck with just ONE gas cap key.

I use a regular gas cap on my '78, but I keep a locking gas cap in the glove 
box to use when I am camping at some of those spaced out, N2O - share the 
balloons, loud music at 2 AM w/firecrackers music festivals.  (Late the 
first night, one guy set up next to my '78 camper with a small tent with a 
N2O tank and huge balloons.  2 for $5.  There was a line outside my '78 
Westy waiting at the tent for their balloons.  Can you imagine me yelling 
out at the crowd 'hey, get away from my bus!!  I'm gonna call the guards!!&quot;  
    RIGHT; lots of luck..  OH, yes, I did meet a lot of interesting kids 
that festival, with my GD stickers.  I just can't wait for my new vanity 
plate,  NORML,  so I can really fit in.)
