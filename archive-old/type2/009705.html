&gt; Uhhhh, I think the &quot;American Way&quot; is the no gauge, idiot light

&gt; People that depend on idiot lights are -- well, gee, how can I say
this nicely?

In aircraft, they have what are called &quot;annunciator lights&quot; that come
on when various aircraft parameters (exotic things like &quot;oil pressure&quot;
and such) are out of the safe range.  These let the pilot know that
things are amiss before things go completely haywire.

Pilots don't call them &quot;idiot lights&quot; and we shouldn't either.  You
are far more likely to notice a lit warning light that isn't normally
lit than a thin gauge needle that is not where it normally is.  Some
folks even wire a buzzer into the circuit, so the light is accompanied
by a audable alert.

Guages are good for diagnosis, warning lights are good for warnings. 
There's no reason why you shouldn't have both on your vehicle.
