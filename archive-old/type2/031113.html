&gt; I want to lower the CR on my 74 1800 type4.  It has dome top pistons in it.
&gt; Don't ask how they got there.

&gt; Original shims were .025 at the head and .008 at the case = .032 total shim
&gt; height.
&gt; 
&gt; I figure i could replace the .008 with a .015 and just drop the CR a bit.
&gt; 
&gt; I know that i should use one shim against the case rather than a stack of two
&gt; .008's .  Anybody ever run a stack of shims under the cylinders?  Did it
&gt; leak?

when I rebuilt my 2 liter the head was flycut because it was not square
(GEX head)  there was then insufficient deck height, so my mechanic used
three shims under the cyl. to get (I think) .045 or so.   the heads
torqued down fine and there have been no problems so far (6,000miles)

and of necesity he also used a single .025 shim between the head and cyl.
when finished deck height was slightly below what is spec'ed.  but I
wanted the CR down a little on mine too.
