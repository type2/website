Subject: [T2] split &amp; bay gas tanks?
Content-Disposition: inline

is there a difference in these gas tanks? will either one fit in the others place? did the bay windows thru out the later years change there gas tank shape size? my 66' tank is rusting bad. my 68' tank is nice but i'm still driveing it. don't mant to stop driveing to switch tanks to find that i'm not able to. do want to get the 66' going and start work on the 68's' front end.   thanx for any and all info on this. i ask the shops and they look at me funny.     wingnutt
