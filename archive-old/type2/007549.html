On 11/3/98 7:39 AM, SHE-AGCE_at_email.msn_dot_com thus spake:

&gt;Please don't set your timing by ear.  Detonation doesn't have to be bad
&gt;enough to hear for it to destroy an engine.  I hate to bring bad news but
&gt;you've very likely ruined your engine.  Rings seldom work well after they've
&gt;been badly overheated.  And even worse,  the exhaust valves usually break
&gt;off pretty soon after they have been as hot as you describe.  It's MUCH
&gt;cheaper to overhaul an engine just before it drops a valve that to wait
&gt;until just after.

     Since I'm sure there's a relatively new audience out there (we get a 
fair amount of turnover around these parts), thought I'd repost this old 
favorite of mine. Original text is by Bob Hoover, and it explains how to 
make your very own degree wheel. Once you've got that, you can time your 
engine using a static timing light, rather than the more expensive 
advancing timing light. It's in the archives at 

&lt;http://vw.i405_dot_com/sm.asp?path=\type2_at_primenet\11\0721.txt&gt;.

     Basic gist of it is using simple high school algebra and precision 
measuring instruments to make your own degree wheel. Pretty cool. Note 
that the link in my original post doesn't work anymore, since the Vanagon 
archives have moved, but the original article is included in the post.



Peace,
