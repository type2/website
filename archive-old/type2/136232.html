Subject: Re: [T2] Where to wire Stereo power?

If it's just a stereo (head unit) you're using- with a regular internal amp., there is no need and no benefit to doing all this.
If you are running an amplifier, then, yes, go straight to the battery- with a large guage wire.  The inline fuse is a safe idea though, even though it will be fused off the fusebox.


Battery + post to inline fuse to stereo. Ground the stereo up front. 

If you want switched power get a Radio Shack 12 volt relay and... 

battery + post to inline fuse to relay switched side, out the other switched side to the stereo.
Also:
Run the + side of the relay coil to the ignition coil, the other side of the relay coil to ground. 

Now the stereo only gets power when the key is on.
