Here's an offbeat question, but I had to ask anyway. I have a Muir
Anniversary issue of some sort (can't remember the year, 25th I think.)
It's spiral bound so that it can lay flat. THe wierd thing though is that
it's arranged backwards. The front cover is where the back should be and
vise versa. The pages are also laid out in reverse order. Kind of novel but
hell when trying to tie things together from one page to the next. Anybody
else have one of these or have I stumbled on to a true &quot;collectable?&quot; Bus
content: Finally got my lazy _at_ss back out in the garage to work on
finishing my 71 bus resto before all the new rubber starts to dry rot from
age. Engine is done, dash is finished...well almost. Just need to work back
with stereo and accessory wiring and get it carpeted. Soon I should have a
reason for keeping it insured. Can't wait because it looks cherry. Thanks
for the bandwidth.
