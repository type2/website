Subject: Re: Insulation/WarmerBus

&gt;  I think VW originally installed fiberglass batts for insulation,
&gt; about an inch thick and unfaced (no foil or paper facing on either

In the only bus ive had with original insulation (69 deluxe) VW put a
brown fibre insulation about 1/2&quot; thick its was not glass seemed organic.
pieces were glued to the roof above the headliner in the side walls,  none
in the doors.
There was a thicker insulation glued down under the rear seat on the
angled section in the indented parts of the mmetal
