Subject: Re: [T2] RE: Setting Total Advance Without Degree Wheel
Cc: type2_at_lenti.type2_dot_com

You have hit on the best way to set your advance.  You are correct, the 009
must be set to 30 degrees full advance to work correctly.  The cheap timing
lights will not have the adjustment feature.


&gt;Some scientist type will probably knock this full of holes but it seems to
&gt;work for me.  I have a timing light (from Pep Boys) that has a timing
&gt;adjustment knob on the end.  I set the knob at whatever I want the total
&gt;advance to be (say 30 degrees).  Then rev the engine up to where there is no
&gt;more advance.  Leave it revved up and adjust the distributor so that the 0
&gt;degree timing mark lines up with the case halves.  All the while, you are
&gt;pointing the timing light at the pulley so you can see the light flashing
&gt;when the timing mark matches the case halves.  Now, when you set the timing
&gt;light back to whatever initial advance should be, the light should flash on
&gt;the correct timing mark (for your distributor) at idle.  I find this reverse
&gt;method particularly useful with a 009 since it requires a different initial
&gt;advance than what most pulleys have marked.  You always want total advance
&gt;between 28 and 32 so, if you find that first, you find initial advance at
&gt;the same time.
