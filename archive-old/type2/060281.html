Subject: Electrical Problem/Dead Bus

Hello,

 I had the same problem when I bought my 73, and it turned out to be the
alternator.
I went ahead and took my battery to an Autozone for a check and had them
recharge it at no cost to me. After putting the battery back in, started up
the bus (yes, the evil gen light was there!!) and checked the
voltage...11.5v. I went to a FLAPS and got a used alternator and installed
it. It has been 7 months with no problems. One big note however, I couln't
find anyone to test the new alternator before installing so it was a gamble
that I won...you might be better off getting a new one or a rebuilt.

Hopes it helps
