Subject: Type4: Which Exhaust?

Ron at Bus Depot lists 3 exhaust kits for Type4 buses with oval-port heads:
two 72-74 kits (regular and stainless) and a 75-78 regular. I'm at a loss
to figure out why these are differentiated by these year ranges, but that's
due to heavy ignorance on my part.

My situation is that I'm going to replace my JBWelded 2-liter with an 1800
for a while and I'm seriously thinking of getting new heat exchangers and
exhaust from Ron. I think I prefer 1700-style (72-74) exhaust w/stainless
muffler mainly because I am sick of messing with mufflers and exhaust...and
I'm thinking stainless will last almost forever. 

I don't plan to have a catalytic converter on the bus: is *that* why the
75-78 is different--to accomodate the catalytic converter? 

I will have a heat tab that goes off at 265F, so I want to keep a cool
head. ;)

So here are my questions:

Any problems with stainless mufflers or experiences to the contrary?

Will an engine run cooler with 75-78 exhaust or with 72-74 exhaust?

Thanks a bunch! Joe
