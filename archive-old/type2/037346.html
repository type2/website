Subject: Engine question

HI everyone, 
        a few months ago I blew the engine in my 70 bus. I picked up a used 
one(since I am in college and can't afford anyhtign else right now). This 
past week during spring break I swaped the motors. Everythign went smoothly 
and I went to start it and nothing. I checked a few things out. It has spark, 
I can smell the gas, and I don't hear any nasty sounds coming from the 
engine. I am puzzled why it won't start. The only thing I can think of is 
that the used engine has a bosch009 on it. it looked to be in pretty decent 
shape so I decided to use it. Is that  a bad idea? Does it have to be set up 
differently?  any and all sugestions would be greatly appreciated. Thanks.
