Subject: RE:  Front curtains for my 1971 Westy (anyone repo these?)

&gt;I just cleaned out a box of misc parts and found the entire set of 
&gt;curtains to surround the front childs cot that gets installed above 
&gt;the front seats. 
&gt;These will be sold in the future, but what I would like to know before 
&gt;I sell them if anyone has (re)produced these in different colors...
like 
&gt;I see the top awning material  is now being reproduced in different
colors

I got my curtains, front valance, awning, and poptop from VW Canvas in
LaVernia, TX.  Very nice quality, tons of different colors/patterns to
choose from.

Here's their web page, but it doesn't seem to be working.
http://www.flash_dot_net/~vwcanvas/   Anyone know if the guy is still in
business?? 

Oh, found a phone# and address too:  (830) 779-2136  VWCanvas 104
