Subject: Re: [T2] HIGH IDLE PROBLEM

Hi David,

First off, please make sure the CAPS LOCK light on your keyboard is  
not lit before you start typing your emails.

Secondly, A &quot;tune up&quot; is not what you need... you need some  
diagnostics done to determine what the problem is. It is NOT the  
thermostat, though you should get it replaced if it is broken.

If the engine is running rough there are many potential causes...  
ignition, compression or fuel system problems will all lead to  
reduced power. Another &quot;tune up&quot; might help, but I'd suggest you ask  
the mechanic to test the compression while it's in there. You might  
get lucky and find that an injector lead has come loose or a plug  
wire is off, or it could be worse. A compression test will tell your  
mechanic a lot about the condition of the engine.

Driving up a two-mile hill at 65 MPH is something that should be done  
carefully with a heat-soaked aircooled engine... I would strongly  
recommend you add a Cylinder Head Temp gauge if your planning on  
doing that a lot. Your engine will last a LOT longer if you keep the  
temperatures down.


Happy trails,

&gt; I TOOK MY 79 BUS ON A 30 MIN TRIP. THE TRIP CONSISTED ON A AVERAGE  
&gt; 65 MPH
&gt; DRIVE. I ENCOUNTERED A BIG HILL THAT TOOK ABOUT 2 MIN TO PASS. THE  
&gt; HILL WAS EVEN
&gt; HARDER ON THE WAY BACK HOME. ON THE WAY BACK HOME MY SPEED DROPPED  
&gt; TO ABOUT 40
&gt; BUT I STILL GOT OVER THE HILL. I NOTICED THAT MY CAR WAS IDLING  
&gt; VERY HIGH.
&gt; WHICH IS VERY WEIRD BECAUSE I JUST GOT IT TUNED UP LAST WEEK. IT  
&gt; ALSO IS
&gt; SHAKING. IM NOT SURE WHATS WRONG WITH IT. BUT I KNOW FOR SURE I  
&gt; DONT WANT TO GO PAY
&gt; ANOTHER 170 BUCKS FOR ANOTHER TUNE UP IF ITS GONNA LEAD ME HERE  
&gt; AGAIN. I THINK
&gt; IT MIGHT BE THE THERMASTATE BUT IM NOT A MACHANIC. I LOOKED AT IT  
&gt; AND ITS TORN
&gt; BUT LIKE I SAID IM NOT A MACHANIC.
