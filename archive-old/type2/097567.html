Subject: Re: [T2] Wing window latch removal

Not too hard a job is to drill out the two flat rivets that hold it to the
window frame, and just slide it back leaving the frame, glass and rubber in
place. The hard part is riveting the new one in again I had to make my own
(I modified an aluminium pop rivet, and removed the steel pin) The problem
is the rivet has to be flat on both sides, and you have to hammer it over
with no support.
