Subject: Factory Engine Preparations

Hello List,

Since expanding my skills from maintaining to rebuilding 1600 SP/DP engines,
I wondered if anyone knew what type of fully assembled engine tests ,first start or break- in procedures were done at the factory prior to shipping Mexican built vehicles to the dealer?


Thank you,
Joe Delecki, Grand Isle,VT.
