Subject: Re: Cutting out

You are the third listie to have this problem this month! I can't remember
what the other gent decided - something about his starter circuit, and the
distributor's condenser wire shorting out where it goes into the can. Mine
we think was a gauge wire grounding out. Either one will kill the motor
dead dead dead. A short to ground should explain the accessories, too. Any
other theories?
