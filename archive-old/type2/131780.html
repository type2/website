Subject: RE: [T2] Bentley on Automatics

I ran into this the other night working on my '77 Auto. I was just changing 
the fluid and the filter screen. What I was doing was straight foward and 
you get the jist from the pics and info., but it does make you wonder.

&gt;Ok, still working on friend's 77 automatic. Consulting the omniscient
&gt;Bentley, which clearly states through 1979 on the cover. Flip to the
&gt;section on automatic transmissions, which mentions something about the new
&gt;75 or 76 transmissions being different, and that's about it. I look at the
&gt;bottom of the page, and it's copyright 1976. Upon random looking, I then
&gt;notice that various pages of the book are copyrighted as early as 1974.
