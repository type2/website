Gentlepersons-
                       Until you pull the windscreen, cut out the rusted 
areas, carefully micro-
weld in German steel...Permatex flowable silicone windshield &amp; glass sealer 
(part #
65AR), works to stop that annoying weeping that's helping destroy your 
floors, etc. 
from within. Cut the tip as close as possible to the end to insert behind the 
rubber
seal. Recommended by an old car guy at the local FLAPS (SS 396 Chevelle!), as 
THIS
one works. Pouring rain today, and it does...OK, when Spring is incoming, 
we'll all do
the right thing, but 'til then...
