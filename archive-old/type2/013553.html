Hey there Volks,

Since it's Friday....

Twas written:
&lt;&lt;  its is just that some people don't realize that a good
&gt; example of a restored bus is worth $12,000.00 or more. &gt;&gt;

To which Tony in NJ replied 
&gt; ...And a $12,000.00 bus costs how much to restore? Even
&gt; at minimum wage labor, at that. 

With the topic of 12k buses being discussed, How 'bout buying a
50,000 mile original bus. Seems to me to be the easier way,
especially *if* the owner has the prior maintanence records. No
restoration needed. No fuss, no muss, just get in and drive.

A little too expensive for me, but it's definitely cheaper then a new
Eurovan camper (looks better too). Hey Mike S., aren't you looking
for a sage green deluxe camper 8-) 

Also, there's a *watercooled* 76 VW LT28 camper (and yes, there's a
photo) on vintagebus auctions (www.vintagebus_dot_com), direct link is :

Enjoy...
