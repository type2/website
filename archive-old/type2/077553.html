Subject: 72 Westy for sale

The day has come that I must reluctantly part with my 72 Westy.  Over the 
last 16 years, the bus, this list, and I have become quite attached... a 
lot of fond memories of good times on the road and of friendships made with 
like-minded list members I met met online.

Unfortunately for my VW love affair, my life dictates the need for a 
vehicle with more towing capacity than the Westy can handle.

The bus runs well now, but years of VW driving experience tells me it may 
soon need a cylinder head.  Other than that, it is ready for the next 3,000 
mile trip to Mexico.

I just finished creating a pictures and sales hype page at 
http://www.pobox_dot_com/~cbaxter/vw which should answer a lot of specific 
questions.

Please pmail me if you have interest/questions/suggestions/advice or phone 
(903) 926-3212.
