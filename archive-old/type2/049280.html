Subject: [T2] alternator pulley...help!

hey volks,
well ive got my engine back, all new seals, bearings,
etc.  looks great and is ready to go.  i decided while
the engine is out i would have my alternator redone,
just to be preventative and all.  well the guy wanted
about $95 dollars to rebuild it, and a rebuilt one
from the FLAPS was $95 also.  but my brother in law is
currently working at a FLAPS and gets a 20% discount
so i bought one through him.  thats where in i have my
problem.  the new one does not come with a pulley and
there was no way in hell my old one was coming off. 
we tried carefully to use a puller tool, and then not
so carefully and its a lost cause, i am in need of a
pulley.  does anyone out there on the list have a
pulley?  the alternator is from an 1800.  help me out
please, i need to get this engine back in as my other
vehicle is having problems so i am currently carless. 
thanks in advance.   just pmail if you have one and
how much you want for it.
