will throw a few brain cells into the mix,.  I don't have a website either
so can't host a list.

from above it looks like only 5 bodies interested ????

&gt; Whatever web site that develops will need some basic pages:
&gt;
&gt; We need a TIME WINDOW page to define the event. June is pretty reasonable
&gt; target for this thing. July gets pretty hot, and August is usually very hot.

June or Sept seems about best but I don't know the weather in central
Tenn.

&gt; We would probably need to agree on a set of PAINT PRODUCTS that Terry would
&gt; feel comfortable using and which would be available near the event, in
&gt; variety and quantity for whatever this demands. That would help dial in a
&gt; ballpark dollar figure that a participant could be ready to meet.

sounds fine
&gt;
&gt; Do we need a FINANCIAL page?

probably, we will need some basic site stuff, maybe a porta pot. etc
should probably plan on a $100??? site fee, just for the basics, help with
the electric bill, etc

&gt; We could arrive Sunday, get settled and organized, and start working on
&gt; buses on Monday. The following Saturday probably should be set aside for
&gt; closing down the event, cleaning up, packing things away, and getting buses
&gt; in shape for going home.

makes sense, begs the question, where do we &quot;Live&quot; can't hardly spend the
night in a bus that just got painted,,,,,,I'm flyiiiiing....

&gt; That leaves Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday and Friday for actual team
&gt; accomplishments.....5 days.
&gt;
&gt; One of those days probably will be spent dealing with a tornado or dust
&gt; storm or electrical brown-out-whatever. Nothing ever goes exactly as
&gt; planned. Leave a day for the unexpected to happen.

Murphy ALWAYS puts in his two cents worth.

&gt; So we might get in four good work days.  What can __X___number of people do
&gt; in four days, given several sheetmetal nibblers, a welder, rivets,
&gt; grinders, sanders, lots of drills and dremels, and a spray booth with all
&gt; the equipment for spraying. Developing a AVAILABLE TOOL LIST will be helpful.

yup need a tool list.

&gt; We will need water, trash barrels, dependable electricity, lots of power
&gt; cords and junction boxes. Looks like a FACILITY page.

wonder what the local power company would charge to drop a &quot;service line&quot;
like they do for carnivals or fairs...have a post with several outlet
boxes on it.  would save our ears from having couple generators going full
blast for a week.  might be worth a few hundred dollars just for the peace
and not having neighbors complaining about the noise.  Are there
neighbors?

&gt; Each participant will have to collect his/her panels and body parts and
&gt; rubber seals, etc, and bring them to the party, along with a personal plan
&gt; to get that bus ready to paint by the end of the day Thursday at the

makes sense.

&gt; Its just a stream of thought. Making it better should be easy.  I usually
&gt; edite and revise anything I care about at least 10 times. Run your finger
&gt; tips over this surface and see how it feels :~)

well.  need to have a site with

BUSES, each person coming lists thier bus and priority of the work they
want done,,,Terry figures out a list of what is possible.

FACILITIES, what were gonna need and who is bringing it, and if important
item who is backup.

$$$$, a site cost, what it is gonna cost as &quot;admission&quot; to this party.
  then maybe a bus cost, how much the individual will need for that bus,
ie, paint costs etc.

TIMETABLE,  rough timetable of what and who is doing what on any given
day.
eg:Monday
 bus 1 getting painted,
 bus 2 getting masked,
 bus 3 getting sanded
 bus 4 getting welded
 bus 5 &amp; 6 waiting and drying....

 human 1  painting bus 1
 human 2 &amp; 3 masking bus 2
 human 4 &amp; 5 sanding bus 3
 human 6 welding bus 4
 human 7 runing to McDonalds for lunch...

etc

  having extra humans would only help...

more ideas welcome
