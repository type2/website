Subject: Putting a 1600cc into a 73

&gt; &gt; &gt; I've got someone that's interested in buying my 73 Westy but they have
a
 1600DP that they want to put in the bus rather than the 2.0 that I have
 with it.

 WHAT, are they crazy? For power and performance I would stay with the 2.0.
 or is the engine blown?&lt;&lt;&lt;

&gt; If all you have is a 1600, it beats walking.

I agree but if you noticed I asked if the 2.0 was blown.

&gt; &gt; &gt;They are wondering though how the bus will do with that engine.

 one word... SLUG

My '71 resents your epithet.  It prefers the term &quot;stately&quot;.
1600s push buses very nicely.  No, not a performance engine, but there is
no VW engine that will give a bus &quot;high performance&quot;.&lt;

Oh really? wanna try and stick with my bus while I'm doing 90 down the
Interstate with my below average Type 4 engine? Your 1600 cc dp do that?

If he wants to stick a 1600 in his bus thats no business of mine. I was just
throwing out the fact that 2.0 Type 4 engine is a better choice. I have no
problem's with Bays with 1600's in them I know alot of people who have them
and are happy. It just seems sorta backwards to take a 2.0 Type 4 out and
put a Type 1 motor in it.
