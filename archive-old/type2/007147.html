hi guys... need some help here. can anyone tell me if the european spec
carbs for dual setup would also have been setup for dual vacuum
distributor? these are for 72-74. we have a 73. the # 2 carb ( main) i
want to install , has no vacuum port tube on the throttle body like the
old carb.

what can we do to solve this problem? can we drill this? is the tube
available somewhere or can we pull the old one?
anyone ever done this?

brice and michael 
73 westy

what part of &quot; thou shalt not&quot;  didn't you understand?
