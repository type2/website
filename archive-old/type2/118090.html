Subject: Performance T4 engine for sale at Manassas Bug out...

If my 73 does not sell in the next couple of days it will be for sell...

I still would like to sell my 73 with the engine and tranny installed but now
am leaning to sell some parts separate...

I am selling the engine and 091 tranny as a package.  It is a running engine
complete.

Some of the features of the engine for sale are:

           tighter interference fit valve seats
           elimination of Head gasket
           Mild porting
- Porsche windage tray
- Custom hydraulic cam
- Full balance of all rotating parts
- German Pistons and cylinders
- Racing clutch bolts
- Case modified to accept Vanagon oil dipstick tube to eliminate the
problematic rubber boot on the T4 engines.
- Dual 40 Dellortos with update kit.
- All tin in place and thermostat works correctly
- Custom fit 914 Bursch racing exhaust with turbo muffler
- Head temp gauge head: Head temps run in the 220 to 250
- 009 distributor  with Electronic Ignition
- Allison Red coil

- Engine has about 41,000 miles.
- Averages about 20 mpg

- 5 rib 79 091 gearbox-shifts and runs fine.
     With Welded Cross shaft

several hundred miles on it)

Dual-Dual throat 40 Dellortos with the update kit installed
Allison red coil
Distributor with electronic ignition
electronic fuel pump
79 091 five rib gearbox
