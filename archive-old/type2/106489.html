Dear Air Cooled Campers,
Spring is just around the corner! Time to hit the road in some new
air-cooled camping shirts. Tired of settling for only Bugs and 21 window
microbuses on shirts?  Now you can show your support for pop-top camping!
We have pop-tops and high-tops, on splits and bays and vans, printed on 100%
cotton hand dyed or tie dyed shirts and sweatshirts.  These shirts will not
only show to other folks your interest and love for camping, they will
increase your gas mileage by 50-percent! We have long sleeves, short sleeves
and custom colors.

You'll find all these exciting new designs here:

Grateful Ed's Tie Dyes has been supplying high quality, hand dyed clothing
to the coolest people on earth for over ten years. Our clothing comes in all
shapes, sizes and designs and our goal in life is to please our customers in
any way.

Sincerely,
Grateful Ed

P.S. If you received this email you have been referred to us as someone who
would be interested in this information.  If you do not enjoy air-cooled
vehicles and their camping counterparts (which is very hard to believe)
please reply to this email with the word &quot;REMOVE&quot; and any other expletives
you deem necessary.  We are sorry for any inconvenience, you will never hear
from us again. You are subscribed as neithammer_at_aol_dot_com
