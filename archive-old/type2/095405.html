Subject: Re: [T2] timing and generator question

so i am still kinda have some questions.

the 34 pict 3 and dizzy # jf 0 231 178 009 seems like it could be alot 
easier to tune if i installed a vac. advance dizzy?
i have the required vac. ports on the 34 pict 3..... pluged?
got no response on the svda from aircooled_dot_net?
i need a alt. kit or junkyard eqiv.
AND a fuel pump
AND a hub to replace the mismatch of the 71 (38 amp) tin and bug (30 
amp)gen.?


&gt;
&gt; &gt; seems to be alot of problems with the 34 pict 3 and 009 what does the 
&gt;list
&gt; &gt; think of svda from aircooled_dot_net?
&gt; &gt; why do some (wolfsburgwest)vendors alt. kit come with a fuel pump?
&gt; &gt; will my pump not work?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;You will also need a bug alternator or generator fan hub to properly
&gt; &gt; position the fan.  The bus hub won't work.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; do i need to worry about the hub if i replace with alt. kit?
&gt;
&gt;Yes if your current generator is mounted using the 38A (bus generator)
&gt;tin.  If the thin at the forward end of the generator is slightly concave,
&gt;you need a new hub.  Ronnie at Old volks fixed me up with a brand new one.
&gt;
&gt;The hub is the same for all bugs, alternator and generator.  The odd hub
&gt;is on the bus with the 38A generator, so it isn't included in the kits.
&gt;
&gt;Speaking of kits, if you can get OEM tin and stand used, do so.  I'm not
&gt;pleased with the quality of the Taiwan tin and stand in the &quot;kit&quot;.  I
&gt;ended up scrounging the tin up at a wrecking yard in Reno (thanks, Chuck
&gt;Notmeyer for the tip) and it fit very well.
