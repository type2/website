Subject: Obnoxious rattle = broken fan

1600 DP w dauschund haus
My obnoxious rattle had gotten steadily worse. I first suspected the
muffler or tin but finally pulled the fanbelt and no noise. I tried
tightening the fan nut with the engine in but it wasnt loose. Spinning the
pulley didnt make any noise but wonking in back and forth got me a small
klonk from the fan. I was expecting to find a broken woodruff key but
instead found the fan hole was all broken up on the edges. 
I dug through the stash (sanford and son music appropriate here) and found
a few candidates. I was surprised to find that the fan on the bus was the
narrow one and luckily one of the new ones was a higher vol fan with
the offset shroud bit. Wow there were a lot of spacers in there. I also
found half a hoover bit in there and the only one i could find was broken
as well. From looking at Ron Vness page pic and making paper models I
think I have a way to make a replacement from a single cut and bent piece
of sheet metal. The fan shround was ratty as well so now im in the middle
of cleaning and painting up a whole set of tin and If I have time tomorrow
Ill do some more prettying up the engine compartment.
If my hoover bit works out Ill post it up.
cheers
