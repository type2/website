 My name is Frank Mckusick and I am looking for a source to answer some of my questions about building my current '71 1600cc.
The current idea is that I would like to bore it over and make it a 1776 or so. One company sells a 1915 /69mm x 94mm. I was wondering 
how much I can realistically bore the cases and heads over and still not worry about cracked heads and or cases. I would also like to build the 
best oil system possible and I have found an eight row-cooler/filter kit, quart and a half sump add-on, oil breather kit, and a oil pressure 
adjustment knob which I am considering. Is this too much? I plan on adding vdo oil temp and pressure gauges to keep track of things. One last 
question for now is that I have obtained a webber carb off of an 1800cc and I was wondering if this might be a good upgrade for the newly built 
engine. Any info is greatly appreciated. 
						Thanks,  frank
