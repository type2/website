&gt; ok i bought a set of 34mm carbs(solex) from
&gt; cbperformance a month or more back and have had
&gt; nothing but problems from them cant seem to get the
&gt; adjusted right and keep having problems from one of
&gt; the two carbs....
&gt; 
&gt; the flap (choke)on one of them will not close unless
&gt; i hit the accelerator and then the flap will come
&gt; loose but still is tight and will not close....
&gt; so taking a closer look i seen a small piece of
&gt; looked like copper sticking out of one of the ends
&gt; of the flap looked to me like a piece of somehting
&gt; that had fell in there...?
&gt; well i grabbed a pair of small needle nose and
&gt; without any force it came out and there was two
&gt; pieces there.... together they looked like a small
&gt; circle or copper ring...? the ring together looks no
&gt; bigger than a very small washer of some sort but
&gt; copper looking...?
&gt; 
&gt; i need to know can i rebuild this or not..?course
&gt; shouldnt have to buttttttttttt someone throwed it
&gt; together it looks careless.......or in a hurrry or
&gt; maybe accidents happen...?
&gt; i was told this morning that that little piece may
&gt; or may not come with a rebuild kit...?
&gt; cant remember what he called it but will find out
&gt; later,...from him tonight possibly or when he sees
&gt; this post since he is a list member..
&gt; 
&gt; this really sucs... cbperformance has a no return
&gt; policy and no garuntee thing going on which sucks
&gt; even worse... 
&gt; i just need it fixed.. is there anyone out there
&gt; that can help me with this that is experienced with
&gt; duals...or carbs in general maybe...?
&gt; 
&gt; if all this looks foreign or cant understand what i
&gt; am talking about feel free to ask
&gt; questions...please.. this is a must ... i gave back
&gt; the weber i was using and have about given up on
&gt; these carbs.and ready to trash them even though one
&gt; of the two seems to function very well..... i kept
&gt; thinking it was all my fault till this morning when
&gt; i realized that the carb has something wrong with it
&gt; from whoever the person/s was that built it from
&gt; cbperformance....
&gt; slack on there part but no blame i just got to get
&gt; this thing fixed...
&gt; i can later on this evening try to take a picture of
&gt; the piece that came out of it and post it up for
&gt; viewing...
&gt; thanks for any or all help on this subject..
&gt; peace and love
