Hi everyone.
I'm new to this list and have a question.
I have a 1973 Westy that I have been restoring (slowly) for the past few
years.
My question is: I am in need of a new engine. The smog pump and related
piping has been removed from my current engine.
What should I be looking for in terms of year model to upgrade the power of
my engine?
The stock carbs have also been replaced by a dual chamber Weber kit.
Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.
My bus (&quot;Chris) is my only vehicle and these repairs are needed badly.
Thanks for all the advice I have already received by reading the posts.

Tom Adams
