Jamie,

Unless someone on the FMBC or the type2 list is willing to sell you 
one your best bet is ebay. They can be had for less than $20. If you 
want a new one you can go ahead and buy it as Andrew suggested and 
then download the color wiring diagram from www.vintagebus_dot_com. I did 
this for my 67 and then laminated the color print and kept it in the 
bus.

Good luck.

&gt;Hello,
&gt;Does any one happen to know the best place to get a Bently, I had 
&gt;rather have the older one with the color diagram. [see below]  If I 
&gt;can't find one of those I will go get a new one, but with the 
&gt;purchase of my *new* 69 I would like to have that book that EVERYONE 
&gt;swears is the best!  Any help would be greatly appreciated...
&gt;SEE YOU AT EVERYBUS!

&gt;Hey,
&gt;You can buy the book new. You can go right down to Barnes and Noble or
&gt;Viking and buy the same book I have. The only difference is that the wiring
&gt;diagrams aren't in color, as far as I know. The new ones are around $26. The
&gt;old ones are more desirable and go for about the same used because of the
&gt;color diagrams.
&gt;I got mine on Ebay for $20 (buy it now) and that was a steal!! I would watch
&gt;Ebay or even half_dot_com. I checked and didn't see anything right now though.
&gt;Good luck!!!

&gt;Hey, I am in search of something .... a Bentley like you one you have with
&gt;the great pictures and discritpions.  Do you kow if they are still made or
&gt;if you have to get a old / used one?  I am thinking of posting something to
&gt;see if anyone knows where to find one, if I can't just go to Books-a-million
&gt;and get one.  Thought I would try you first.
&gt;Thanks
