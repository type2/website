Subject: RE: [T2]  Head swap up date from Matt

Thanks Will.  I do want the engine running properly.

Matt

Matthew--
friendly suggestions, seems like the jug is mismatched with the old rings
you have?  Maybe if you tried new rings just on that cylinder, it would work
better--maybe re-hone that jug also (check for roundness with a precise
instrument). I know it sucks to drop the engine again, but you are getting
closer.

good luck,
Will A.
