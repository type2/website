Great work Craig!

Here are some thought about dealing with replacement switch problems.

58 is juice to the fuse box for the parking lights.
57 is juice to the parking light indicator on the instrument pod.
58b is juice for all three dash pods (speedo, clock, guage cluster)

When you pull the knob out one click all three of the above get juice so you get dash lights, indicator, and outside parking lights. Pull it out again and you get headlights too but 57 looses juice. 58b has the rheostat control. 

Replacement switchs do not have 57 for the indicator lamp. You simpley put a Y on spade 58 and the indicator will be on when the headlamps are on too but this may not be a bad thing when driving in the rain during the day because you might not forget the lights are on when stopping the vehicle.

If you rheostat on your original switch goes bad you can reroute 58b to 58 and will have power to the dash pod lights and bypass the scratchy rhoestate(fire hazzard)

Good luck
Chris
