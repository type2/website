Subject: Re: [T2] '78 westy

On a perhaps more selfish and distasteful note...  I'd love to hear about
someone paying that for a bus.  Seems as though it would make mine that much
more valuable  Come to think of it maybe I don't want mine to be that much
more valuable... (theft for parts, insurance costs, etc. - and of course the
philosophy creeps in about what VW is all about).

&gt; my 2 cents.......
&gt;
&gt; a 78 Westy for that money is alot of $$$$
&gt;
&gt; but a 78 Westy that was driven 20 plus years will have many problems
too.....
&gt;
&gt; if money is not the object, buy the low milage one (after a mechanic
checks
&gt; it out) and replace all the fuel lines, brake lines and tires which  are
&gt; probably hard or rotten.......
&gt;
&gt; sure there will be a few more hiccups, but nothing like a bus that has
&gt; 200-300,000 miles on it.......
&gt;
&gt; and its still half the price of a new minivan......
