Subject: Bus TV Sitings....

Well, since it's Friday, I figured I'd share my Bus sitings on TV!

I was watching a Seinfeld episode re-run. Kramer apparently became all
whacked out, and decided to move to California. His 1987 Chevy Caprice
Classic broke down, and he started hitch-hiking. A blue bay window Bus
stopped and picked him up. It had like 10 hippies in the back, and they
all started signing and smoking pot.

I watched Pirates of Silicon Valley last weekend, needless to say, there
were plenty of bays. Wozniak was driving a beige campter van. He was
pulled over by a bike cop I believe and they started to search his bus. 

I also watched the Woodstock Video of Jimmy Hendrix that I have on
LaserDisc (classic!) and in the beginning it shows scenes of the
crowds... needless to say, I think I counted about 12 bays, and an
uncountable number of splitties. There were also some beetles, and Dodge
Cargo Vans. :)
