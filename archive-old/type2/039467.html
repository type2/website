Subject: need help with pistons and cylinders

hey list
this may sound like a naive question.  i am in putting new pistons and 
cylinders on my engine.  they have come in a box already put together. do i 
have to take them apart and use a ring compressor or can i just put them on 
together without taking them apart?  id appreciate the help.
