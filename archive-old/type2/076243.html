Subject: Re: [T2] Question for a friend

The reb wire running from the back to the front fuse panel is bad.

Also he should remove and clean both ends of the battery cables. Knife and 
wire brush.

&gt;The dude i trade my '66 to emailed me and said he was getting NO

&gt;is good and hooked up correctly, what other things are likely to create 
&gt;this complete lack of power?
