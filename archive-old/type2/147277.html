Subject: Re: [T2] bus accident

&gt; I gather 
&gt; there are a couple of very good Type 2 repair guys in your
&gt; neck of the woods,  Randleman, N.C. was mentioned on this
 &gt; List not long ago.


Thanks for the advice I appreciate it.
Yeah I heard MetWiz http://www.metwiz_dot_com is in North Carolina.
I've been thinking if I have the option... and the time I'd like
to take my bus there, since he's a list member and he seems to
do excellent work.
