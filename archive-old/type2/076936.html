Subject: Trans Seal &amp; then some 

 Hello List,
     I am sorry to be reposting this but until I get a Bentley's I am really
 lost. When I removed the rear Trans seal another piece came out with it.
 It's a cylinder about 1-1.5 inches long and about 1&quot; across. It has a
flange
 that only allows it to go in so far.
     I only got one reply. and it said it was a oil sling and just put it
 back in. No disrespect, but I have been told by others that it was supposed
 to be pressed in and someone told me it's an inner bearing race.
     An exploded diagram would be a great help. Also, if anyone with a
 Bentley's is located in Wilmington, NC. I sure would like to peek at the
 book.

 Thanks,
 Jim
