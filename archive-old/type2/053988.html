Volks,

Here is the problem as it is right now....engine starts fine and runs well, 
when clutch is pushed in I can fell it get stiff as it goes to the floor and 
it feels really wierd right at the floor. I can shift through all gears 
without clutch pedal pushed in and with clutch pedal pushed in but seems 
like nothing is joining the engine and tranny.
I really hope it isn't the input of the tranny, could the throw out bearing 
just be seized...or are the clutch plate and flywheel destroyed. Anyone have 
any ideas????

TIA,
