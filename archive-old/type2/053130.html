&gt;I am pretty strongly with Bob Hoover on this.  The problem is that I know
&gt;of no source for the tool you need.  If you go to the RMMW site
&gt;(http://www.motorworks_dot_com/aircooled/index.htm) and look up part # 30282,
&gt;you will see what you need to compress the cylinder up to the case for
&gt;accurate measurement on a Type 1 engine.  The problem is that stud spacing
&gt;on the Type 4 engine is different.. the tool will not fit.  It would be
&gt;easy enough to get a machine shop to make you up a tool like this for the
&gt;Type 4 stud spacing, but it would not be cheap :-(  If anyone has a souce
&gt;for deck height tool that fits the Type4 engine, by all means let us know!

I just use a 3/8 ratchet extension laid across the top of the barrel and
measure the clearance between the ratchet and the top of the piston (along
the edge, not in the dish).  I think Wilson even suggests this.  It's close
enough for government work!
