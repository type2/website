&gt;I want more electrical power.  Are there any recommended alternators out

&gt;a video camera off the 12v of the van while I'm on the road, without
&gt;sacrificing having the van batteries getting a full charge.
&gt;Should I install a second alternator in my 77 for this?

Probably not necessary.  Your stock alternator should have enough excess capacity to run a laptop and video camera (I'm estimating 5-10 amps total if run directly from DC) and still charge the battery, as long as you don't do most of your driving in dark rainstorms.
