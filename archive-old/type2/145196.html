Subject: Re: [T2] hot air tube under the bus

&gt; I thought I would take off the long hot air tube
that runs 3 or 4 feet long under the bus and  insulate
it.  The tube is pretty much shot and 
needs replacing.  Does I need to use some special
tubing designed for such applications, or can i get
something like a dryer vent or similar plastic tubing
of the right diameter?
 
---------------------------------------------------

I would use double wall metal tubing, like for a house
water heater going up thru the roof.

Some people use truck exhaust but it is single wall.

Plastic, abs or pvc, would not stand the heat that
goes thru the pipe and sag in the middle.
