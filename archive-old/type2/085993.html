Subject: Re: [T2] brake drum measurement


Dave

Don't laugh. I use a HARBOR FREIGHT 6&quot; dial caliper to get a relative
measurement by extending the caliper tail to one side with the head on the 
other side. If you have a new comparison drum you can get the delta (wear) 
off the dial. Or the delta off a edge ridge that is not worn.

&gt;
&gt;Folks,
&gt;
&gt;Still working on the brakes on my 78.  Looks like I'm gonna need some new
&gt;front rotors as they mic out at .440...way under, even tho they look good.
&gt;
&gt;Now, I am worried about the rears...
&gt;
&gt;Has anyone got a clue for me about how to measure the rears with
&gt;common workshop tools?
&gt;
&gt;This is something that I have wondered about for several years now and I
&gt;am ready to figure out how to do it.
&gt;
&gt;The fancy calipers they use at the flaps to do this appear to be  very
&gt;expensive....and no, I don't have a set of calipers that big.
&gt;
&gt;Cheers, dave
&gt;
