&gt;Funny, I am a pilot and there is NO WAY you should ever use oil designed for
&gt;airplanes.  Some airplane motors actually use mineral oil for the first 50
&gt;hours of operation.  Can you imagine the horrible outcome in a VW?  Stay
&gt;away from that stuff!  Just because they are air cooled and look similar
&gt;does not mean they were engineer even remotely close.


ALWAYS question wizbang ideas. They are experiments until throughly tested,
with hard data obtained from controlled conditions. Olive oil withstands
much higher heat than petro lubes. It doesn't follow that it is a solution
to overheating for overloaded or non-spec motors. If your not getting good
results with spec lube, something else is not spec and a non-spec lube is
not likely to improve things enough to save your wallet.
