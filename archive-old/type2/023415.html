Subject: Horrid tranny sound
Date: Sat, 16 Sep 2000 22:39:47 -0400

Greetings listees...
     Just installed a new engine (thanks dave!) from a VW car-oil filler
 and dipstick go in the top- and had to swap flywheels as the pressure
plate/clutch would not fit...I assume I switched from a 210mm to a 215mm
flywheel (is that circumference or diameter?) the basic upshot here: the
tranny, which worked well before, now emits a low &quot;organ note&quot; type sound 
when I put it into gear...(I vaguely remember Muir had something to say
about this phenomenon but I have mis-placed mine...)  It was not a pretty
sound so I didn't even leave the driveway...shut it down and dove into the
archives to no avail. What could cause this? Hope it's not TOO bad...
                                       Snave
                                       '74 Westy dying to be driven...
