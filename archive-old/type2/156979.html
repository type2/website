Subject: Re: [T2] Speaking of fuel pumps....

&gt; that in my F*rd truck.  You can imagine the fun of
&gt; cleaning that mess up. 
&gt; 
&gt; I read in a post about a ratcheting fuel line clamp.
&gt;  It's gotta work 
&gt; better than the vise grip. 
&gt; 
&gt; What is it and where would I get one?
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks,
&gt;

The closest to what I have (and recommend) I found at
Summit Racing for about $10 a pair. (Mine came from
Tool Town in Federal Way, WA) Here's the link to
Summit:

or - here are part #s:  SUM-W84018 and/or  SUM-W84017
The #18 is probably the one to get.

I also used a set of long-nosed vice grips that I put
heat-shrink tubing over the jaws to protect the hoses,
but they're awfully heavy. -BaH
