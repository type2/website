&gt; This is nothing new but I have a question.  I would like to be able to pull

&gt; that is a little dicey.  Would a transmission jack allow me to do this?  Do
&gt; most of them have the reach for this?  Have any of you done it this way?

that is how I pull my 78 engine all the time.

I have one of the Harbor Freight sissors jacks and it is not the kind of
thing for production work in a shop, but it works real well for me.

couple points, I have made a bracket that clamps to the jacks and will
bolt to the engine, (at the headers) this helps stabilize things.

also on the Harbor freight jack I found that it works best when the socket
you raise and lower from is towards the front of the car, this makes it
quite awkward to use. not a big problem lowering but can be a real PITA
when jacking it up.

but I routinely put my 2 liter engine in and out solo.

and I'm a 50+ year old weakling
