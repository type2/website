I too have a ford starter solenoid, and on my last trip to Vegas the thing 
came undone and was hanging under the bus.  I figured buy a new one was the 
fix.  Installed the wires and nothing.  Walla it has to be grounded so we 
remounted it in Baker, and of course it fired up.  Second how many volts do 
you have when the key is turned?  It is possible to have 12.5 but only have 7 
or so with the key turned which is not enough to turn it.  Did you try a 
jump?  If it works great if not go back to the solenoid.  Let me know how it 
goes.
