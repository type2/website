There's  not a damn thing wrong with a well-maintained CIS system.   
I've  had an
'89 Cabriolet for the last five years, put 140k miles on the car,  and  
aside from a
shorted fuel pump relay caused by water leakage  there hasn't been a  
single
problem with the injection.   Ditto for my cousin's one-owner CIS- 
fueled Volvo
244 Turbo, ditto for  my coworker's CIS-fueled BMW 320i that he uses  
for SCCA
rallies,  ditto for countless thousands of CIS-fueled cars on the  
road.   It's a solid,
dependable fuel delivery system with very little to go wrong,  unless  
you're the
type of person that drives a car into the  ground every year or two by  
Just Not
Giving A Sh*t About Your  Vehicle.

The injectors are no more prone to leakage than any other  fuel  
injector I've ever
dealt with.  I got a set last week  for my Baywindow CIS project from  
a Fox that's
been sitting for  god knows how long (at least three years), they leak- 
test  and
spray-test just fine.  Yes, the fuel distributors are NLA .. but  it's  
rare to ever need
to replace one.  The plunger gets  stuck if one sits with gasoline in  
it, but cleaning
out the  varnished gas with Berryman's B-12 takes care of that 99% of  
the  time.
&quot;Outdated&quot;?  If we were concerned with bleeding-edge technology  in our
vehicles, we'd be on the Prius list or something, not Type2.   :-)

Probably one of the main things that killed CIS at the end of  the  
'80s was the
requirement of On-Board Diagnostics that started  in the mid '90s.   
How do you
put a computerized diagnostic  system onto what's nearly a mechanical  
fuel
injection  system?  You really don't.




hey Guy  To each his own. I have worked on enough of these to know  what 
happens with them. Yes the water in the relay is a famous problem . Also  have 
seen the hoses leak in engine compartment and at the pump.  fuel dizzy  boxes go 
bad quite often. Pumps also.  Not really a mechainical system  other than the 
injectors themselve.  Real mechaical system had a belt  driven fuel pump quite 
like a diesel. To me it is an outdated system that can't  hold a candle to 
electric fuel injection. On board diagnostic didn't have  anything to do with Vw 
and everybody else going away from it, the fact is  electric systems work 
better.  You want some more of those injectors just  let me know I have a draw 
full of bad ones   :)  later  mark  d
