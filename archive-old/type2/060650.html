Subject: '7x Westy Delux 10.5K?

	Said:  
&gt; I guess David and I are the only ones that think
&gt;  this may be reasonable.  
	SNIP...
&gt; If this Westy is has been professionally restored,
&gt; no bondo or other BS, 10.5 may not be out of line.
	SNIP...

	So what is a Westy or van that IS in original condition worth?
	I don't mean one that has been well restored. I mean one that has
not
	been restored, because it does not need to be restored yet because
	it has original paint, no rust, and has been maintained at or near
factory 
	spec mechanically?
