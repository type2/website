Subject: Quick SoCal-NoNevada Trip Report

Had to do some business in Carson City, Nevada, so I drove up and back in
my '71.  No family along, so I could make time.  Headed out at 7:00 Monday
morning from Canyon Country.  Up the 14
freeway past Palmdale and Lancaster.  Stopped in Rosamond for gas
($3.219).  Proceeded up the Owens Valley and noted that the rising
temperatures were somewhat mitigaged by increasing altitude.  Stopped in
Bishop for gas (Arco $3.159) and bladder drainage.  Headed north into the
Sierras.  3rd gear at 40MPH over the passes.  Nice and cool at altitude.
Made it to Carson City after 412 miles at about 3:30PM.

Spent three days in Carson City doing maintainance work on a house there.

On Friday morning, I got an early start at 5:45AM.  Headed south on US395.
Traffic is horrible in the Carson City/Minden/Gardnerville stretch.
Stopped for gas in Gardnerville (Arco $2.899) and headed back into the
Eastern Sierra.  I'm carrying about 800 pounds of stuff, but this doesn't
seem to affect the bus too much.  Still 40MPH over the passes.  Another
nice driving day with little wind, but since I am descending as the day
gets hotter it seems to get really hot really fast.  On the descent from
the last Sierra pass into Bishop the temperature increses 12F in less than
10 miles.  Stopped for gas in Bishop (Paiute Casino, $3.099) and headed
south.  Passed through Big Pine, Independence, and Lone Pine.  Lone Pine
has a big new movie museum (a lot of Westerns were filmed in the Alabama
Hills just west of Lone Pine) but the museum isn't open yet.  At Indian
Wells stopped at the Indian Wells Brewing company for a case of Mojave
Red.  Temperatures crept past 100F in Rosamond.  Joined the freeway
madness in Palmdale and hurtled down the hill toward Canyon Country.
Fueled for the last time in Canyon Country ($3.21)

Total miles driven: 840
Mileage: 19.4MPG
