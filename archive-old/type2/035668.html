&gt; &gt; OK - I used to think I was having a weird CLUTCH problem when the bus was
&gt; &gt; cold/just started, but a sudden flash of -DOH!- just hit...


&gt;
&gt; &gt; TODAY, I had the DOH! I was sitting there WITH MY FOOT ON THE CLUTCH to
&gt; &gt; avoid this problem and I realized: when I start the car, I always have it
&gt; &gt; in NEUTRAL - the clutch has got nothing to do with it!  In neutral, the
&gt; &gt; engine is engaged to the tranny, but nothing should be happening; yet it
&gt; &gt; was.  Pushing in the clutch simply disengaged the pair, so that SOMETHING
&gt; &gt; in the tranny was NO LONGER spinning. And thus taking 'away' the sypmtom.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; SO. WHAT in the tranny is boogered that is spinning when it ain't s'posed
&gt; &gt; to, causing the axles to turn?


When the tranny fluid is that cold &amp; old (below 20 degrees F) it is so viscous
that you would be hard pressed to pour all of it out of a bottle in less than
30 minutes.
And, the engager gears on the secondary shaft may not be engaged,
but the friction between them and the shaft is high enough with the thick
fluid that it is enough to try to move the bus / slow down the idle. 

Solution: Synthetic tranny fluid. (Not totally cheap, about $40-50 for
the whole tranny) In 85W140 thickness, it is much less viscous at low
temps, allowing for an easier start and better running when cold. 
If you cant afford an entire fill, just do two quarts of syntho with two
quarts of regular 80W90 hypoid. When cold the syntho will sit on top
and be the first fluid to get splashed around the case. 

It used to take me 5 minutes to ease off of the clutch in temps
below 20 degrees or I would stall the engine. Now I dont
worry about it at all.
