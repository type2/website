been there done that, (for different reasons)

&gt; Remove the rear cushion/pad from over the engine.

don't have a pad or cushion ?

&gt; Station a friend in the back seat.

he drove I looked

&gt; Drive the bus onto a convenient freeway.

I-83 

&gt; Have your friend unlatch the engine hatch and attempt to remove it.

I did it

&gt; If the hatch springs right up when it is unlatched, then the air pressure
&gt; in the engine compartment is positive.  If it does not, and tugging at it
&gt; will not raise it, then the air pressure is negative.
&gt; 
&gt; Two warnings:
&gt; First, I don't know the answer, I'm just proposing the test.  That hatch
&gt; is a couple square feet and if the air pressure is strongly positive, it
&gt; is going to spring up quite forcefully!  Be careful!!!

the differntial is quite small, as neither did it pop up nor was it hard
to open.  I suspect but have no evidence that it is slightly negative

&gt; Second, the engine is noisier than you think!  Do not be shocked at how
&gt; loud it sounds with the cover off :-)

and how!  took putting the cover back on to convince me the engine was not
blowing up!
