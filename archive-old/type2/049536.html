&gt; So, I'm thinking way in advance here, but I might be going to work in
&gt; Colorado this summer for about two months.  I hear there's two or three
&gt; little hills around there.
&gt; 
&gt;     So, here's my question.  Do I drive an automatic, or a standard?
&gt; I'm scared to take my standard on any hills around here, because I don't
&gt; want to stall it and roll backwards into other cars.  That's like, my
&gt; worst fear.

well learning how to &quot;heel/toe&quot; a stick on a hill is not that difficult
trick to learn

&gt;     On the other hand, I hear the automatics suck, and might not pull me
&gt; up the hill.  (also, do autos fail a lot?  I don't want to be driving
&gt; cross country and be stuck because i drove an automatic bus.)

on the other hand, I have a 78 automatic and while I live in the East I do
ski and run around a lot of mountains in winter.   While the Automatics
tend to be even more sluggish than the sticks, they have a real advantage
in that you &quot;can,t&quot; lug the engine, it will automatically downshift to the
correct gear.  It may be slow but it will make it to the top.  The late
Automatics (govenor shifter) is as reliable as any comparable auto tranny
vehicle and has not left me stranded in almost 100,000 miles that I have
put on mine (I have changed out the tranny but it didn't leave me
stranded)
