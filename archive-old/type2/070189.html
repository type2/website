Subject: Re: Oil question

This is a side note to the question regarding the synthetic oils.

I recently read an article in Consumer Reports which analyzed 
different oils to see which one outperformed the others. They ran a 
very controlled experiment as it was described. Loaded up some Autos 
with identicle motors, ran em a certain milage changing the oil every 
6000 miles, then removed the motors and miked them at certain 
wear points.  

The conclusion the report gave was that all the oils, as long as 
they were certified, (certification is a starburst symbol on 
the can) performed almost identically. Obviously your choice of 
viscosity will vary from Alaska to Arizona. The one exception 
I recall was that synthetics seemed to perform better at lower 
temperatures.  I don't recall how they got that 
conclusion from the test data collected.  

Sorry I'm talking generalities, but I'm going by my somewhat poor 
memory.   

Now for a song,
sung to the tune, 

&quot;look for that union label&quot;

Look for,
that Starburst label,
when you are buying,
some oil for,
your bus! 

You need not worry,
about the friction,
just combustion,
which causes,
the heat!

Look out Friday!
