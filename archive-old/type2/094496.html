Subject: Re: [T2] Keeping a bus from being stolen

A bus parked for maintenance at one of my favorite shops had padlocks on 
every door and hatch.

My personal way is to wire in a second ignition switch that isnt so easy 
to hot wire with a keyed lockout for either fuel pump or coil.
The switches on all buses and vanagons up to about 92 come under the 
heading of &quot;beginner auto theft&quot;  if you defeat the steering wheel 
lock.  buses prior to steering wheel lock come under &quot;auto theft for 
dummies&quot;   I was looking at how to wire the westy today and decided i am 
going to use the method we used in the military.  a loop of chain 
through the steering wheel.  The casual thief doesnt usually carry heavy 
tools with them.
