Subject: Re: [T2] VW Trademarks

nah. 25 miles is nothing. I drive my 79 43 miles each way every day. I
have found that any vehicle works better when driven on a regular
basis. It helps w/ maintenance usually if you know you are counting on
it. All I can say about the considerations is to just go through the
Bentley maint. checks &amp; confirm as much as you can. Esp brakes.

&gt; maintenance considerations?
