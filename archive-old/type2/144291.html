Subject: RE: [T2] Dwell Creep

I know this is from yesterday and probably resolved by now but let me
comment anyway....

When dwell changes with RPM it is usually a result of either a worn
distributor or a missing spring between the distributor shaft and
distributor drive gear.

If the bearings in the dist are worn you can get all sorts of funny
&quot;standing waves&quot; in the vibration pattern that change the dwell angle.
There should be NO side to side movement in the distributor shaft relative
to the distributor case.  If there is, replace the distributor.

Alternatively, if the shaft is being pushed up and down by the drive gear
then worn and unworn sections of the cam are being exposed to the points
rubbing block.  VW put that spring between the drive gear and the
distributor shaft to pretension the shaft at the top of its travel and
keep the cam in the same position relative to the points.  If it is
missing then dwell will wander all over the place.  Replace that spring!

OOK!
