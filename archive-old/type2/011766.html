&gt;&gt; the thing together soon. I really need to get to the stationery store and
&gt;&gt; get some of those page-edge stick-on permanent tabs for notebooks and make
&gt;&gt; my Bentley all nice and neat.
&gt;
&gt;I'd be even happier if Bentley manuals had 5/8&quot; in the gutter, so I could
&gt;three-hole drill the manual, cut the glue binding off and put it in a
&gt;three-ring binder.

Jim, consider having it &quot;stake&quot; bound at a copy shop.  I did mine at work
as it was an old, old, beat up copy.

The staking is continuous all the way long the page and much closer to
the gutter.  Works nicely.
