Subject: hoover bit? shroud louvers?

------=_NextPart_001_0000_01C20633.21916270

Firs off, thank you to those posting info on the clutch issue.  I have de=
termined that my 71 dual port, has a pre 70 clutch, which is why it does =
not fully disengage. So now I get to pull the motor....again.  I am readi=
ng some technical stuff on the web, and came across a section on the hoov=
er bit.  I do not have this piece.  My engine came in long block form, an=
d the rest in pieces, so I have no list on exactly what may be missing.  =
Also, I visited John's car corner in Westminister Vermont to get some of =
my pieces.  When I told him I was missing the louvers in the shroud, and =
the thermostat, he informed me that if I only drive it during summer (whi=
ch I will.  Vermont loving to salt their roads)  that I do not need these=
 pieces, and I will get better cooling without.  Says he does it on many =
cars, and has for years.  Now, since I have the engine out, how vital are=
 the mentioned pieces?  Louvers, thermostat, hoover bit?  Seems if I need=
 em, now is the time.Get more from the Web.  FREE MSN Explorer download :=
