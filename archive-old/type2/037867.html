Subject: Parting out (whats left of) a 78 Westy

Parting out whats left of my 78 Westy (auto) thats sitting in Fall
River, Massachusetts. Totaled in accident last August.

Not much left, but lots of small stuff still there. Might be able to
save someone a trip to the junk yard. Engine and most of the interior
is gone, but if you need a &quot;widget&quot;, and its not broken, already sold
or stashed in my spares box, we can work something out.

I will not ship large parts, (auto tranny, doors, jalouise windows,
poptop, etc.). All prices are open to negotiation. What I don't sell
I'll pull and stick in storage till the swap meet season starts up.
Figured I'd post it here first, then place ads on the 'net.

Some details are on my webpage (see sig line - click on the swap area
button), I'm keeping some stuff to use as spares for the 79 (keeping
the FI, other electricals, CV's, and misc stuff). If you are looking
for something specific p-mail me.
