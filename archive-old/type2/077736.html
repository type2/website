Subject: Re: [T2] another emissions question

I'm in late on this one guys....is someone looking for a functioning air
pump for a type IV engine 73/74...if so, I have a complete setup, with
the piping in my &quot;stuff&quot;....it's in mint condition, and I have pics if
anyone wants to make me an offer, it's yours...I have the fan housing as
well if you need that to mount it..may even be able to find the pulley
for the center of the squirrel cage too if you need it..

Den.
