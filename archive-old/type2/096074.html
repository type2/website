&gt; I have 71 Westy bought 3 months ago, with new tires on it, 2 people have
&gt; told me that they are an accident waiting to happen.
&gt; 
&gt; Details from the side of the tires:
&gt; 
&gt; 185 70R/14 
&gt; Ultra Steal Belt A/S Supreme Sport
&gt; Max load range 1155 lbs _at_ 32 psi
&gt; 2 ply steal , 2 ply polyester
&gt; Sidewalls 2 ply polyester

they are as others have told you WAY too small.
&gt; 
&gt; Should I yank them off?

for sure unless you enjoy a total tire failure at 70 MPH....

BTDT, not fun
