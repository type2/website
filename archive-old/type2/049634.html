Subject: [T2] lizzy is alive...but cold!!

hey volks,
i wont waste much bandwidth here, but i am just happy
that lizzy(73 riviera, 1800) is alive again.  engine
back together and in!  spent all day saturday getting
it put back together, woke up sunday to 10 degree
weather!! so i was happy i got off my butt saturday. 
got up this morning to about 4 inches of snow and 3
degrees!  needed a little ether to get her going, but
she cruised into work just fine...albeit a little
cold!  guess im gonna have to work on that heating
system and make sure ive got all the bugs worked out. 
 all in all im happy to be back on road and cold
