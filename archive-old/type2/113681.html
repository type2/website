Brakes (flexible rubber lines especially but also the steel lines - they 
rust from the inside out) ASAP and then fuel lines ASAP x2.

Don't forget to check the steering system for wear and on the later 
baywindows there is a rubber doughnut between the steering column and 
steering box. Mine was rotted and scary looking.

Check tires for proper load range and condition.

Do every single maintenance item (adjustments and inspections) in the book 
as many of our old VW's have been neglected all of their &quot;lives&quot;.

And yes - buy the Bentley manual. The Muir Idiot manual is good to learn 
where the pieces are and define things in layman's terms. Stick to the 
Bentley pics and procedures.
