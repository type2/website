&gt; Maybe some ducting may help. Lets assume you blow air
&gt; through the oil cooler from underneath into the small
&gt; space above it. Block the front facing side of the
&gt; space above the cooler leaving the rear open, then build
&gt; a shroud around the fan, closed on the rear and open on
&gt; the front ..  drawing/being charged by air out of the
&gt; air stream under the car.

I have an oil cooler mounted about 2 feet forward of where you were
discussing on my '78. I get good cooling without a shroud, but I added one
before a mid-August heavy surftrip run into deepest, sunniest Baja CA. I
cut up a plastic 5-gallone gas can to make an air scoop the right size,
attached it with 100# plastic ties. It hund down an extra 2.5 inches or
so. Maybe 3&quot; max. as far as I dared lower it. Anyways, I didn't notice any
additional cooling value over what I was getting before and the thing
vanished without a trace after some dirt road driving. Presumably
something caught it and ripped it off.

It probably rammed as much air as a fan would have drawn. Similar
clearance restrictions will apply if you use a fan. But if it gets ripped
off you will have live electrical wires dangling and a more expensive
piece of hardware at risk. Consider using a scoop instead of a fan. In
either case, consider attaching it by some breakaway thing that can fail
safely if you hit something. Maybe push-on spadefoot connectors that
could just pop out if the thing gets ripped off would be better than
soldered connections.

Good luck,
RT
