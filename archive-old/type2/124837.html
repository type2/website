Subject: oil pressure switch sealing

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I am now trying to decide
&gt;&gt;&gt;between replacing the oil pressure unit with a new one and some Teflon
tape,

&gt;&gt;Don't use teflon tape. The oil pressure switch needs to ground to the case.
  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Well, the above statement is not quite correct.

    The oil pressure switch has a special kind of thread called  &quot;pipe
threads&quot;. Pipe threads are not like machine threads. Pipe threads are
tapered. That means, the first threads are really shallow and the first part
peaks of the threads do not reach all the way to the bottoms of the valleys
of the female pipe threads. However, as you get to the other end of the pipe
threads, they get &quot;longer&quot; or &quot;taller&quot; . If you just barely screw in a pipe
thread fitting into the female fitting, the connection will really wobble
because it is so loose. If you just barely screw together machine threads,
nuts and bolts, the pieces will be just as tight at the beginning of the
thread as they are at the end of the thread. You must screw pipe threads
together far enough for them to get tight. In most pipe thread applications,
you must add a compound commonly called: &quot;pipe dope&quot;. The pipe dope is a
substance that helps to fill in the spaces in between the threads to seal the
connection. In high pressure steam pipes, you do not use any dope; you just
screw the pipe connections together with great force to get the tapered
threads to crush together and seal the joint like a tight cork. Steam pipes
are strong steel. In plumbing water pipes, you do use pipe dope and you do
not have to connect the pipes so tightly together to crush and deform the
threads to create a seal.

    In the VW engine oil pressure sensing switch case, you do not want to use
too much force. The whole setup is too delicate. It is made of easy to deform
and easy to split aluminum alloy. If you screw in the switch too tightly, you
will enlarge or split the female hole in the case and you may ruin the case.
If you are lucky, you may be able to tap out the ruined hole to the next size
up PIPE thread. Or you may be able to weld the hole up and start over. It is
much better to use a sealing compound, pipe dope, on the oil pressure switch
male pipe threads. I prefer to use Permatex Aviation Gasket Compound #3. I
put it on thick and I let it dry for 10+ minutes and then I gently screw in
the sender. From experience, I know how tight to get the sender to stay in
and not leak. It is better to have it a little loose than too tight. If it is
loose, it will leak oil and you can screw it in tighter. If you screw it in
too tight, you will expand and maybe burst open the female threaded hole. You
must screw it in tight enough to not pop out.  Because the system is so weak,
it is better to use a sealing compound pipe dope on the threads; rather than
using so much force to deform and crush the threads together to get the seal.

    The oil pressure switch senses oil pressure. If the oil pressure is HIGH,
over a certain amount , the switch does nothing and there is an OPEN circuit.
If the oil pressure is too low, the switch CLOSES and makes a connection to
ground and completes the circuit in the low oil pressure indicator light on
the dash and the light comes on. The oil pressure switch must have a good
connection to ground to work. It has a connection to ground by touching
ground; by being screwed into the grounded engine case. No matter what pipe
dope you use, teflon tape, or 3 M Weatherstriping glue, or Indian Head Gasket
Compound, or Permatex, or whatever, the oil switch metal male pipe threads
will tightly touch the female metal threads of the grounded engine case. Some
of the pipe dope will scoot out of the way and you will have tight metal to
metal contact to allow electricity to flow through the switch to ground.

    I have always used a sealing compound on the threads with no problems. I
have used teflon tape with no problems, although I prefer the glue types of
pipe dope. After you install a new oil pressure switch; all you have to do to
test the circuit is to turn your key to the 'run' position and check to see
if the low oil pressure indicator light is on.

    Actually you should always start your VW bus like this. You should know
the difference between the key in the 'run' position and &quot;start&quot; position.
When you turn the key, you reach the &quot;run&quot; position first. In the 'run'
position, you do not have to hold the key; it will stay there all by itself.
The next position is the &quot;start&quot; position. You have to hold the key in this
position against a spring force trying to twist the key back to the &quot;run'
position.

    The correct way to start your bus:

    When you first get in your bus. You turn the key to the &quot;run&quot; position,
then you take your hand off the key and you put your hand on top of your head
until you can remember to do the next step. With your hand on top of your
head, and OFF OF THE KEY, you stare at the insturment cluster and you notice
if all the engine emergcy problem warning indicator lights are on. You have
to see the low oil pressure warning light burning brightly, you have to see
the low voltage warning indicator light burning brightly. (there may be more
problem warning indicator lights) If you see ALL these lights on, then you
can take your hand off the top of your head and grab the key and turn it all
the way to the start position and run the electric starter motor until the
gasoline engine starts. Then let go of the key and it will automatically snap
back into the 'run&quot; position.

    The reason you do all this is because your engine will be ruined if the
oil pressure drops too low and you keep driving. The only way you will know
the oil pressure is too low is to see the low oil pressure warning indicator
light come on. The only chance you have to check this light is when you first
turn on the key. When you first turn on the key, you check the light; if the
light is burned out, like all lights do, then you replace the light before
you drive off.

    This is not a perfect system. It could be that you did test the light ,
before you started the engine, and then you started driving and 30 miles
later your oil drain plug fell out, but the light burned out at the instant
the low oil pressure switch tried to turn on the warning light. It is
unlikely that this will happen. But if you never test the light, then you
won't know the light was burned out before you started to drive. Constant
indicating gauges only partially make up for a burned out problem warning
light failure. With a problem warning indicator light system; a sudden burst
of light coming on will get your immediate attention, whereas, you must
constantly stare at a gauge to notice a problem. You cannot constantly stare
at a gauge, but a warning indicator light will get your attention especially
if you weren't paying attention at that particular instant.

    I know this statement : &quot;then you take your hand off the key and you put
your hand on top of your head until you can remember to do the next step&quot;
sounds silly, but most people just jerk the key and start the engine and
drive off totally unaware if the engine emergency low oil pressure or low
voltage indicator lights even work. I have heard people say, &quot;I burned up my
engine because that #$%^ idiot light never came on&quot; ;   or,  &quot;It won't start,
and it can't be my generator because my generator light never came on&quot;. In
these cases, the warning indicator lights had burned out unknown ages ago and
the idiot driver never noticed and kept on driving.

    That is why problem indicator warning lights are called &quot;idiot&quot; lights.
It is just so simply to test the lights when you turn on the key, that it is
only idiots that don't perform this test before they start their engine.
only idiots that don't look at each light, only idiots that don't count the
lights ; only idiots that don't know what warning lights they have to check
before they drive off.
