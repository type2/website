&gt; Correct, I have 2 77 Westies, both are running solid
&gt; cams with used hydraulic lifters on them, one has over
&gt; 200,000 TROUBLEFREE miles on it and the other has over
&gt; 150,000 TROUBLEFREE miles on it.  
&gt; 
&gt; No I do NOT pull my engines to fix them each month. My
&gt; daughter drives hers everyday and I did mine, until a
&gt; drunk plowed into it.
&gt; 
&gt; 

Hey Karl  That was the way I was thinking also. i would think that the hyd. 
cam with solid lifters wouldn't work quite as well, but it would still work. 
Soory to hear about the drunk driver,  later and have fun  Mark Dearing
