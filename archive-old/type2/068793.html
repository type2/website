If you keep your bus lloking like shit, you obviously don't take a great
deal of pride in it, or respect for it...if you don't respect your bus,
then why do you subscribe to this list...?

first of all, I don't have a beautiful vintage bus, if you mean shiny paint
and perfectly straight and rust free.    I have a number of somewhat tatty
old vws.    Not a one that a non vw head would say &quot;great bus!!!!&quot; about.
   The 53 looks like it's been driven through h*ll and back, as virtually all
the paint has been eaten off by acid rain.  I think it's beautiful.  The 65
camper, Nellie, has a b*tt ugly paint job.  I admit it.  I would rather it be
the original velvet green and white.  Really I would.   But I decided to save
it anyway, it was a ACSAR bus. Bugster, my indestructable, faithful, (touch
wood) 69 bug with great heat and no rust, has a $15 rattle can job on it from
6 years ago when I first got it, to cover up the rattle can camo job he came
to me with.   I do have pride for, and respect for my vws, but not enough
money to have the bodywork and paint done, yet.  The 53 will be a show
bus.... when it is done.    The 65 will need rocker repair and a bit of dent
work and paint to LOOK nice, but I am still getting it mechanically sound.
  I also want to get the steering lock sorted out.   (Ha, steal it now!!)
   I plan to drive it, prolly through the snow (it is snowing in Oly, WA,
right now) to California for the Christmas holidays.  Not that I would MIND
having a nice shiny split, and would be happy to accept any donations.

I have never yet had anything stolen out of a car (I have only owned
aircooled vws), and I only lock them in a big city.  BTW, only 2 of the vws I
have had (the first two) were drivable when I got them, or when Mike and I
got them together.   

I subscribe to this list because I like old VWs, and like to see what other
people have to say about them.
