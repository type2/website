&gt;bus. I mentioned the knock and he said &quot;oh that's  your fire
&gt;exstinguisher not bolted down properly.&quot; oh..........


Hell, don't start sweating it until you've blown the better part of 2
evenings chasing down for hours what ends up being golf balls rolling around
under the seat.  Did that in the Corrado one week, I mean carefull analysis
of when it happened, curving which ways, at what speeds, putting it up on
lift, shaking everything.   Now anyone who has seen one of my vans simply
realizes that weird sounds are just to be ignored so long as one doesn't see
food dissapearing and movement under one of the piles of
tools/junk/whatever.
