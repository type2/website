&gt; interesting
&gt; that means the crank is turning
&gt; the distributor gear  is moving
&gt; but the cam  is not.
&gt; i have seen  cam gear come loose but  never without noise  and binding.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Checked TDC on #1 and when moving 10+ degrees in either direction, the
&gt; &gt; valves do not move at all.

or it could be that the valves are not adjusted properly
 or cam followers are stuck above the cam??
  or hyd cam adjusted like a solid?

take off the oil pump and see if the gear is cranking, sheared
bolts/rivets might be visible
