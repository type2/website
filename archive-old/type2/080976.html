Re: [T2] vacuum integrity of &quot;biscuits&quot;
&gt;Karl:  First, thanks so much for taking the time to post all those tid bits.


&gt;Secondly, re the little secret: No excuse here except that in addition to the
vacuum measurements, I also measured pressure at my fuel pumps this afternoon.
The lag time for my brain to switch  units is obviously more than the four
hours I gave it.


&gt;And finally, I had no idea that each can and arm has its own part number.
I'll look for those numbers tomorrow. In the meantime, would it be correct to
say that if I transfer, say, an 07 102 can and 889 arm from an AN distributor
to an AJ distributor, then I create a unit with 5-8 degrees of vacuum advance?
This is equivalent to the statement that  the various distributors owe their
advance/retard characteristics solely to the can/arm type.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Almost all distributors are the same as far as the centrifugal advance goes.
This is on the dual advance units. Either vacuum advance and centrifugal or
vacuum advance/vacuum retard and centrifugal. Swapping vacuum units changes
the specs.
But you cannot swap the arm by itself. It is part of the vacuum unit and not
replaceable.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
&gt;Your data trouble me. If I go to, say, a GEX catalog and order a rebuilt
distributor for my '71 Ghia or '71 T2, I get a generic distributor with any of
a variety of part numbers. That is how I ended up with AN and AJ units.  To my
knowledge, there is no vendor who will take an order for a 205Q distributor.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Correct. Rebuilders put together whatever they have laying around and call it
what you want it to be! I doubt seriously that they even have a distributor
machine to test advance curves. I was at the junkyard one day and found a 70
bug with a brand new rebuilt single vacuum unit dizzy in it. Was just put in.
I don't think the guys check cleared the bank yet, it was that 'new'. I did
not have a list of dist. numbers with me to verify what it was, but I bought
it anyway. Got it home and lo and behold, the body of it started life as a 74
1800 bus dist. that was supposed to have a dual vac unit on it. I could not
find any numbers on the generic aftermarket vac unit. I wish rebuilders would
remove the original number..... In this case, I have no idea what number it is
now. The only part number you could go by was on the box when the guy bought,
but that number went by-by when he turned the core in in that box.
So I have a 'parts' distributor waiting for the correct dual vacuum unit....
I like to put together correct combinations. Makes it a lot easier to know
what you have. But it takes time to find all the pieces.
