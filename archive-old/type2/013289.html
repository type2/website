To: type2_at_type2_dot_com

hey volks,
well i finally got a response back from AVP today. 
below is the email they gave me.  im not really sure
what to think and would like some input from the list
as to what you all think.  they feel that the piston
separated and caused the damage to the head, not the
other way around.  the piston in question is a new
brazillian set from Ron that was put in by a VW garage
and had less than 8000 miles on it and like the rest
of the engine was not overheated.  tell me what you
think?
thanks everybody

Mr. Bell, Hello,We received your head yesterday,and
did inspect it 
closely. 
Actually the picture was even clearer than the head.
What it appears to 
have 
happened is that the piston seperated,and when that
happens, the piton 
hits 
the valve and eventually makes the valve break. We
have been here 20 
years, 
and so far have never had a valve break. We are
willing to work with 
you on 
the head, and replace it for below cost, so you can
get back on the 
road, the 
cost would run $85. plus shipping.
Please call or e-mail, and let us know what you want
to do from this 
point. 
Thank-You, AVP 1-800-548-5766.
