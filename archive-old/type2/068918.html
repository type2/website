Subject: Confessions of a stalling engine

The other day we had our first cold and wet day of winter. And a problem 
that had been creeping up on me with the coming of winter decided to 
strike...

Whenever I took my foot of the gas to brake the revs would drop, engine
would die and I would have to restart with the key while stopped/coasting
Primrose has a manual transmission so I couldn't 'two foot' the brake and
gas to stop her dieing.

As soon as I got home I poked my head in the back.
Choke connected. Choke cam was up and I could 'feel' the spring when I 
moved it so it was working.
No loose HT, No loose LT.
The words 'vacuum leak in the input manifold' were looming large in my
mind.

Then I checked the warm air flap in the oil bath air filter - closed!
Should be open when its cold. 

Now who changed that I'm sure it was right before?

Fortunately I've the type thats easy to adjust (i.e. not connected to the 
fan housing flaps). Five minuets later the air intake thermostat was 
adjusted to have the flap open at a lower air temp.

Off around the block - not the slightest hint of stalling.

Just goes to prove the pre-heated air is important and that I aught to
read what I posted on this only last week!
