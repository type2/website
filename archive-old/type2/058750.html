&gt;Subject: 71 windsheild 
&gt;        Hey now, I just got done removing my 71 windsheild to replace the
seal.
&gt;To bad the thing cracked, so now I have another ?. Where can I get a new
&gt;peice of glass? Also can anyone tell me the way to put the new one in. 

Uhh, carefully?

[Smack!] {Looking ashamed} &quot;Sorry.....&quot;

Really, I broke one putting it in, too. Then I found that I could
have one shipped to me for a total cost of $85 (crating charges, etc.)
or buy one locally from Safelite for $100, installation and lifetime
warantee against leaking included. Best $15 I ever spent.
They installed it 5 times before they finally got it to fit just right.
