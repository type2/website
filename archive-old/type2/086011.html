Subject: Re: [T2] Acceptable speeds


I've got a '72 with a 1600 dual carb engine and a nice aftermarket tach. 
Here's how fast I tend to go:

1st - needle never moves.
2nd - at 25, I'm pushing 4000 rpm (4200 red line)
3rd - ratio is just about 10 to 1000 ... in other words, 20mph = 2000rpm.
4th - red line at 68 or so.
