Subject: RE: [T2] a couple dumb questions

Jesse, There is, in the archives, I think A real nice color wiring diagram
for various buses. If its somewhere else can someone else please tell Jesse.
Pics of the dash are all over the place. Trawl a bit and you will find one

 Is there anywhere that I can find a good wiring schematic
&gt; to be able to figure out what should go where. I'm pretty good
&gt; with wiring and electrical, but most of the wires dead-end and
&gt; don't go anywhere, and there are also holes all over the dash
&gt; where there obviously used to be various conrols for god knows
&gt; what, is there someplace i could find pictures maybe of what the
&gt; dash is supposed  to look like?
