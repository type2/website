&gt; Mixing brands, in and of itself, is not that risky.

have to agree, I don't as a matter of course do it, but it should be
relatively harmless, should even be able to mix synthetic and dino without
hurting things to failure
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; The syn does not seem to hold up to the heat
&gt; Actually, synthetics supposedly handle high temp _better_ than conventional
&gt; oil.  However, most synthetics I've seen are 10W30 or lower.  I tend to
&gt; prefer either straight 30 weight or 20W50 in an aircooled engine.   I have

I run 5-50weight synthetic year round

&gt; This has me worried.  Of course it could be a lot of things.  On the minor

Ron got it in today) gave me the boost to replace the head I've been
meaning to &quot;get a round tuit&quot; for a couple months.

HOWEVER while noisy as all get out, I pulled the plug, and the injector
plug and drove it home probably could have gotten it up to 50mph if I
could have dared...but it was only 3 miles so I drove slow and drifted
down hills etc.   

  BUT,  never any smoke and absolutely no lose of oil

&gt; major side, you could have dropped a valve seat and thrown a rod through the
&gt; case. (Happened to me once; made quite a racket!)  Both would account for
&gt; the loss of power and the noise, but then again so could a lot of other

sounds like good advice to me
