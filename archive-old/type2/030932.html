&gt; &gt; As for pulling the tranny and then putting the engine and tranny back in

&gt; &gt; added to the total package.  I'm not sure yet which method I prefer.

&gt; Isn't it almost a necessity to remove the rear trans mount bolts to
&gt; properly remove and install an engine in a 72-79?
&gt; Seems like I tried it years ago and it was impossible without lowering
&gt; the rear of the trans. (No removeable rear panel like 68-71).

I routinely remove my 78 engine without touching the tranny.  the trick is
to remove the 3 rear pieces of tin and the coil.  I pull it back a short
distance, then start tilting the rear down.

can and have done it alone but it is easier to have two bodies 

now I have an auto tranny and I think it may even be harder with the
torque converter in there.
