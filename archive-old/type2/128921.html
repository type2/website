Howdy. I've been trying to help a friend of mine with his '77 Automatic
bus, which still has the original fuel injection on it. It was running
fine, although not great, about 6-8 months ago when he parked it because
his grandfather left him a &quot;real&quot; vehicle. After a couple weeks, the tire
went flat...couple more and the battery died, and so it ended up sitting
for the last few months. Anyway, it needs to move, so we get the tire
pumped up, and try to jump start it - nothing but click. Crawl underneath,
whack the starter, still nothing. Try shorting across the starter
terminals and it spins, but doesn't engage. Try my good battery out of
crew cab. Still click.
 At this point, I try to turn it over by hand. nope. wrench on alternator
- nope. Ratchet on fan &amp; hub bolts - nothing, and I am not the weakest
person in the world. Now I'm thinking the click was maybe a clunk,
starter engaging, but not being able to turn the motor?
What's going on? Any thoughts, hints, etc? I was thinking maybe a little
moisture got into the cylinders and maybe the rings have rusted in place?
What can be done to get this thing moving before the city comes and gets
it?
Thanks, this is driving me crazy...
