I am glad to hear that other list members do the same thing with their kids
on long
trips.  Could you send me your point schedule for each vehicle.

Also this brings me to another question regarding the buses by the boulders
in Joshua Tree national park.  I was on 395 going north when I saw a blue
bus camper with the tall fiberglass shell on the top heading south.  Was
this a list member heading to the Joshua Tree campout?

&gt; &quot;Bus! Bus!&quot;
&gt;

We play a game with our kids (it was especially hard on the trip to
alaska this year) where they get so many points for a bug, so many for a
motorcycle and so many for a bus (VW, of course).  First one to holler
out &quot;BUS, BUS&quot; or bug or what-have-you, gets the points.

Now they even do it while we're watching movies--caught quite a few
sightings of baywindows as well as the splits this way!
