Subject: Koni Bus Shocks are Back - Get 'em while you can!

After having refused to do another run of the Koni Bus shocks for us, Koni
has reversed their position (at least for now). After their previous
waffling, I decided I'd better not say anything until they were actually in
hand, just in case they reversed their position again. But sure enough, the
shocks just showed up!

To recap, these have been the holy grail of Bus shocks, considered the best
you can buy. They are lifetime warranted by Koni and and the ride is
adjustable to taste. Richard Atwell had worked a minor miracle and convinced
Koni to resurrect them on a custom-run basis (they'd discontinued them long
ago), and I arranged a couple of group buys between the Type2 list and the
Samba. (At that time, there was a 2 month wait to receive your shocks.) Then
Koni had a management change and informed me they would not be doing any
future custom runs, so we thought they were forever gone.

As before, this is a limited-edition run, so when they're gone they're gone.
Who knows if Koni will ever do another run again or not. I think it depends
on the phase of the moon when you ask them.

I am asking you to allow 3-5 working days for these to ship, in case I get
deluged with orders as I did last time. Also, the list discount does not
apply to these.
