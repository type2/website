Subject: Hella Dual Battery Relay,

So I installed my Hella relay before my recent spate of problems, and 
in my travels I disconnected it to narrow my potential problems list. 
The kicker is that I cant remember how I had it all connected and I 
have NO CLUE where I put the instructions that came with it ! Does 
anyone have a copy they can scan ? Or maybe type me the #'s and their 
intended connections ?

Your help would be MUCH appreciated.

Steve
