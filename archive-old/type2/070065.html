Subject: my &quot;new&quot; 69 westy..quirks, problems, etc

All right...i've now gotten the big red strawberry. AKA Itchigo.

Interior is complete, as far as i know, but i'm not sure yet if the sink 
pump works...doesnt seem to, but, not sure. 

Lets see...electrically, i have no brake lights, even though the switches 
are hooked up. BUT i have not had time to check the bulbs. The horn 
worked when i got it, sortof. It needed to be tuned. but it worked. then 
on the way here, it would just stop, for a while. then it would work 
again. then it went off, and hasent worked for 2 days. Backup lights work 
sometimes. i think the connections need work.

Anyway, the BIG problem is the speedo.
I had a 74 super following me back, and my copilot and he had a set of 
motorcyle headsets on. The PO informed me that the speedo was a little off.
No problem, thinks i, recalling the recent discussion on the list. I'll 
just get a certian area cop who owes me a favor to clock me, then i'll 
reseat needle. Or just live with it.

So, on the way back, we put the bus through the paces, to see what it 
would do. I was doing around 70 by my speedo, and mike, in the super, 
tells me i'm only doing 55. Yet, at 65, i was doing 53. At 45, 40. 55, 45.
80, 60. 90, 65 to 67, and, totally peged, a solid 69.

On the possitive side of things, it lets me think that i'm accually hot 
rodding the bus, while accually crawling along.  On the other hand, it 
sucks not knowing how fast your really going.

So, anyone have possible causes/solutions?  One idea i had was that it 
was either the cable&lt;what in the cable hasent occured to me yet, but..&gt; 
or the more probable spring in the speedo itsself. Anyhelp would be 
appreciated.


As for the engine, its a 1600 sp, built new except for the cam and crank. 
it has around 10k on it now. runs like a top. Almost.
The bus has the oil temp gauge, and the sender is installed in a T where 
the pressure sender is. PO said it was possibly a little inacurate 
because of where it was mounted. The temp gauge averages between 180 and 
210 the past 3 days of driving. Except when we pushed the bus for most of 
what it had. Then it ran up to ~230.  Problem is that even after a 10 
minute drive, starting cold, temp gauge at 180, it DOES NOT pass the 
dipstick check. damn thing is almost to hot to hold. have to keep 
switching hands. 

the question: how inaccurate is the position of the sender? and will it 
affect the oil pressure sender in anyway?  can i move it and mount it in 
the sump plate? should i?

As for gas milage, i'm averageing 18.5 for the 2 tank fulls i've driven now.

So...the normal questions of: how do i get it to run cooler, &lt;btw, most 
of the drving has been highway, with the occasional stop-n-go&gt;, and how 
to get better gas milage? &lt;although i understand that 18 isnt that bad..&gt;

Brakes pull to the left a bit, but, otherthan that, they're fine.

Clutch need to be adjusted, almost 3 inches of play int he pedal.

Now to clean the sand and all out of it...from the weekend..:)

Oh, and a humerous, but not so, point...
That cot. You know the one. The one person in the top. Well, it worked 
fine for me. folded in a bit, but not to bad. Didnt accually sleep on it, 
but just layeed on it for feel. 
Well, i weigh around 120lb. A friend wanted to try it, and i said sure..
We quickly discovered the weight limit of it. The crawled on, then 2 
seconds later, his head was in the lap of the girl sitting on the bench, 
his butt was in the sink, and his feet were stuck up top. 
Needless to say, all i could do was laugh. What could one expect from 27+ 
yearold canvas?!?!?  He promises to replace it with some heavyduty stuff, 
but instead i think i'll get my dad to get me some of the stuff that is 
used in theatre....much stronger..

hmm...BIG rip in cot now...:)



anyway.....enought rambling for one night...
