&gt; Hi everybody

&gt; I have found a cheap place to store my van for the winter. A warm place in
&gt; the inside.
&gt;
&gt; But the height limit is 6 feet. Do you know what is the exactly height of
&gt; my van. It's a 76 westfalia WITHOUT pop-top.

Hey wait, you don't have a pop-top?  You can't be on our list then!
