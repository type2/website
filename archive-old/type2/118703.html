Subject: Re: [T2] Torsion Bars (front End)

Hi all,
I'm coming in on this on the tail end, so please forgive me if it's already
been covered.
From my experience with Bay window Kombi's when EMPTY they should sit all
the way up as you describe.
Does it still sit against the bump stops with two average adults on the
front seats? If sinks a little when two people get in the front I would
consider this normal and nothing to worry about.
The Kombi front suspension is quite light and sinks easily with weight up
the front, so it usually sits high when empty.
Regards,
Richard, Brisbane Australia.
