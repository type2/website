Subject: More interior...

I posted this on The Samba, but thought I'd share here too...

Well I got lots done today. I replaced all the rotted wood in the
seats with fresh wood, built a second jump seat (didn't install yet)
and slapped some carpet around. =D

I'm not happy with the carpet on the jumpseat, but luckily I wasn't
sure if I'd like it so just tacked it in place.

I was able to reuse a couple of pieces of wood, but not much. Most was
made from tracing the old wood onto new. Surprisingly, it all went
together without a hitch! I'm still certain that I'm dreaming this. If
it wasn't for my back hurting from nearly 8 hours straight of working
on this, I'd be asking my wife to pinch me! (In fact, I think I'll go
ask her to do just that! LoL!)
