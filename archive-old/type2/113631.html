Subject: That little rubber elbow - was auxiliary air regulator mounting

&gt; &gt; It moumts under the bolt(8mm) that holds the front
&gt;of the air manifold to the case. The bolt(8mm) that
&gt;goes through the case held on by a (13mm) nut. Phil

I was busy with finals and missed the previous thread on this topic - did 
we decide somebody sold the replacement elbow or that there was a good 
hardware store substitute? Noticed mine was rotted BIG TIME.
