Subject: Re: [T2] Points vs. Electronic Ignition

[...]

In my experience the CDI &quot;black boxes&quot; are intolerant of the heat in a Type
2's engine compartment.  When they get overly warm the ignition system
starts to fail, missing and backfiring or simply ceasing to function.

It's a real bear to troubleshoot.  Function usually returns to normal when
the black box cools down.  Of course, this generates a great deal of
frustration because when you stop to fiddle with the ignition system the CDI
box cools down and the fault disappears.

Been there, done that, sticking with a stock ignition system for its ease of
repair in the field.....

&gt;&gt;  ...I was comparing the Pertronix to the CDI and trying to point out
(sorry... ) that while the solid state points may not be perfectly reliable,
the old mechanical ones can also fail.  Fitting the CDI without the
Pertronix (or other points eliminator) does get you most of the benefits of
electronic points but not all.  &lt;&lt;
