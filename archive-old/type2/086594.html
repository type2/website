Subject: Re: [T2] RE: alternative heat source


That is exactly what I am saying, but I am hoping by posting my opinion to
the list someone will point out what I have missed.

Southwind and other gas heater sources sell parts for the BA4. That gas
heater seminar they had last year in CO was for the BA4

But the BA6 was used in bays and Vanagons so there should be heaters
sitting in junkyards. Here is a library link covering the BA6
http://www.type2_dot_com/bartnik/ba6art.htm
I have never installed a BA4, but IMO the BA6 integrates into your heating
system much better then a BA4. Whihc makes sense since it is the latest and
most improved gas heater VW made.

I am thinking of trying to get a gas heater for next winter and was
considering the BA 6 simply because I thought is was the model that would
have been installed as an option in '78. What you are saying is that this
heater is really hard to find parts for and therefore the BA4 is a better
choice? What about that company Southwind don't they sell parts for these
heaters? And finally where would I do best to look for a gas heater BA6 or
4, and how hard are they to install?

&gt;suppose anyone has one of these gems, do you?

I have these on a couple of my busses and they are very complicated, to
keep them safe. This means there are many reasons they won't work. Parts
are very expensive and hard to find. When they do work, they work GREAT!!

It seems more people use the older, simpler heaters rather then the BA6.
I'm not sure what year the bay got them but the aircooled Vanagons had them
too.
