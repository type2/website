Hi all-
   First off-  I hope you do not get this twice- having email probs 
apparently.

    On my 69 bus- I am in need of some parts under the gas pedal.  I need the 
&quot;Z&quot; shaped linkage, also badly need the &quot;pivot&quot; piece that attaches to the 
throttle cable, under the bus. 
    My pivot piece broke, hence, no gas pedal.
   I placed an ad on thesamba, and, while I have had great success finding 
parts there before, no luck this time around.
   So- does anyone have these items in their stash?  Please p-mail, of 
course, so as not to tie up the list.....
  
  Thanx
  Brian
