&gt; The thermostat which is a refurbished one from Bus Depot wasn't allowing
the 
&gt; flaps to open.  

That is interesting as I thought the commandments that were carried down
from the mountain read that &quot;Thy flaps shalt not be in the closed position
if thy thermostat should be faulty.&quot;

Anyone looking for a good used thermostat, flaps, air filter cable, etc??
I've got one I'll sell you...I won't be needing it.

Enjoyed all the discussion
