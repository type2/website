Subject: Re: vanagon seats in 71'

I'm quite sure its a 71' (new 1600 just turned 7k miles)
Looks like they were indeed welded in. Here are some pics:

&gt; Hi Ryan,

&gt; Installing those in a pre-75 bus would require major surgery. The
&gt; bulkhead behind the passenger would have to be cut out and a gusset
&gt; installed, after which the seat bases would need to be welded in.
&gt;
&gt; Are you SURE it's a 71???  Has it got an upright engine and a wrap-
&gt; around front bumper??
