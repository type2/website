Subject: Memorial Weekend in the Midwest

It's almost time again for the MoKan VW club's show and campout called &quot;Bug
Blitz, Bus Blast&quot; or BBBB in Lawrence Kansas on Memorial weekend.

We had a great time last year, almost 80 campers with close to 70 busses.
This is a really neat venue, the campout is on grass just over the hill from
the carshow and swapmeet, about half a football field away and yet you can't
see the one from the other.  People at the car show last year couldn't
believe what they saw when they walked to the top of the rise, busses
everywhere!!

This year we have rented more of the fairground buildings so the swap meet
is under roof, or outside if you choose.  We also have almost twice as many
indoor restrooms.  Along with restrooms we have indoor showers for the
campers.  This year we have also hired some people to keep the restrooms
stocked and clean throughout the weekend.

Free food for paid campers both Friday and Saturday nights.  This is a great
show and campout, just 40 miles west of KC.  Check out the website:
