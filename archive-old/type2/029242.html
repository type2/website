Hmmm...I think I would tear it down. I seriously doubt this is your problem, since you would have seen it sooner, but there's an extra pin hole for the main bearings. If you add a pin to that hole (which would mean you had an extra laying around), the bearing would bind.

If the engine's getting tighter and tighter, I'm guessing binding on one of the bearings. Maybe something got trapped in there or there was a burr on your crankshaft (not likely).

Did you check to see if the camshaft gear matched the crankshaft gear (lift)? That is, did you check for lift as you turned the crankshaft backwards (with the case split). I'm not sure how this would lead to an increase in binding over time, and I know engines run fine (although for fewer miles with these gears fairly mis-matched).

Another thought is that if you've been runnning a lot without actually burning the fuel, you may be filling your crankcase with fuel, which will wash the oil off your bearings and fry them. Now is the time to determine if this is happening. Check the oil level. Is it higher than it ought to be? Smell the dipstick--don't let your neighbors see you do it. Does it smell like gas? If so, worry about bearings. Do you get unexplainable pleasure from smelling the dipstick? If so, seek therapy.

Don't split that case on my say, but I think that engine should be getting looser and not tighter. As for the cam position, if you didn't get the dots between the camshaft and the crankshaft gear lined up, you have a problem that will require teardown to realign. If you failed to get the distributor drive gear properly lined up, you should be able to pull that gear using a relatively inexpensive puller and then reinsert it, aligning it properly.

When you're timing, remember to find TDC by the position of the #1 cylinder. Remember, the engine is at TDC twice (right?): once for compression (explosion) and once for exhaust. On the exhaust cycle, the exhaust valve has to be opened, right? So move the pulley to where #1 is at TDC (checking inside the cylinder (spark plug hole) with a long, skinny, not scratchy thing--I use a long screwdriver--being careful not to wedge your long, skinny, not scratchy thing as you move the cylinder. Then check the position of the valves. Is your exhaust valve open (rocker arm pushing down valve stem)? If it is, you're not at TDC for ignition; you're on the exhaust stroke, which means your timing gear is probably 180 degrees out (or in your case 200 or 160). Not necessarily a big deal, unless putting the dizzy backwards is impossible due to the position of the fuel pump...but you have options other than splitting the case--for this problem; the other may be a different story.

One more thought: Even if you're only a little out in your distributor drive gear position, you'll want to fix that. Otherwise, you'll rack your brain almost everytime you set your timing, trying to figure out whether you got it right this time or if you forgot something and just set it up so that your engine will self-destruct. Ask me how I know. I would rather tear the engine back down just to move the distributor gear (though that's not necessary) than to wonder day after day if I messed it up. In the end, you'd capture the teardown/re-assemble time in otherwise lost sleep.

Thanks! Joe

&gt;But I'm wondering if I need to tear this thing down and look closer, for
&gt;two reasons:
&gt;
&gt;1) on reassembly, my dizzy drive shaft notch didn't line up like the
&gt;books say at TDC.  It was off by about 20degrees counterclockwise.  I've
&gt;tried puzzling out the geometry in my head and it *seems* like this is
&gt;not a problem, but to get timing right at present, the notch on the
&gt;dizzy rim points sorta towards #1 cyl.  But it's the relationship
&gt;between dizzy cam and #1 plug wire that matters, right?
&gt;
&gt;2) more disturbingly, this engine gets tighter and tighter.  On
&gt;reassembly everything was fine, just got progressively tighter as I
&gt;removed end play, added the pistons, torqued down the heads -- but still
&gt;was easy to turn over by hand, gripping the main crank pulley.  Now,
&gt;after running maybe 30 minutes (with the occasional backfire and cutting
&gt;out -- it will not run slow yet) it's getting very tight, and it's not
&gt;just compression.  Can't think what it is, but it's getting where the
&gt;starter will barely spin it -- and it's not the starter; I can barely
&gt;turn it with a crescent wrench on the crank pulley bolt.
