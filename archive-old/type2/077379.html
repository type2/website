Subject: Re: [T2] Yukon's great &quot;I (nearly) don't know diddley&quot; '69 sunroof project

&gt;&gt;Could the 1600 upright engine in this bus have been transplanted from a
Porsche 914 like the seller implied?  It strikes me that 914s all had the
Type IV.&lt;&lt;

i also seem to recall hearing that 914s had T-IV motors.

HTH.

good luck with your 'new' bus!

&gt;&gt;I should be getting a six pack of POR15 in the mail tomorrow...&lt;&lt;

dont mix that up with the 6 pack in your fridge. could be ugly.
