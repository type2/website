&gt; &lt;&lt;NO, she does not have to remove the engine or the heads.
&gt; What engine did YOU say you put hydraulics in??&gt;&gt;

&gt; I gotta say that that pancake engine is the biggest pain ever to work
&gt; on.
&gt;
&gt; Too much garbage to remove to get to the bottom line--the engine itself.

it's not too bad once you get used to it..

&gt;
&gt; Who in God's name allowed the krauts to use flat bladed screw's for that
&gt; sheet metal?

switch em out to phillips when you do your first change.

&gt; I could have rebuilt three small blocks, put a clutch in a Mack, and had
&gt; some time left over to have lunch &amp; a couple of beer's in the time it to
&gt; me to do the head's &amp; lifter's on this engine.

after a bit there won't be any time left for the beer.  now take out and
put back an auto tranny.......!

&gt; Truely an excellent example of Kraut over engineering.

doubt there is a single piece that isn't needed,. it works very well
though.
