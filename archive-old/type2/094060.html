Subject: strange note on master cylinderr

my local &quot;VW&quot; parts supplier got the ATE master cylinder delivered in 2 
hours.  While  installing it i noted that the new one had an area 
ground off of it.  Stranger yet when i pulled out the old  original 
master cylinder it also had a ground off spot.  Then the strange part.  
the castings have the same identical cast markings.  I then looked at 
the ground off spots and realized that on the new one the VW/audi 
emblem and part number was  ground off and on the old  original one  
the ATE emblem  and part number was ground off.  you can  now sell the 
same part as either VW  or ATE.
