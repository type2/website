&gt; Looking down at the Flexplate from above, mine does not look Square to the

&gt; be look for a replacement.

sounds like your flexplate is either not on straight or bent, they are
pretty stiff.

&gt; &gt; &gt; myself. I guess I could pull the flex plate off and install a flywheel
&gt; &gt;since
&gt; &gt; &gt; I am going to put in a new seal anyway.
&gt;
&gt; Let me rephrase this. If I could not stop the flexplate from spinning to get
&gt; my torque then I would swap out the flexplate for the flywheel &quot;ONLY&quot; to use
&gt; the flywheel lock. How do you or did you lock your flexplate, I don't want
&gt; to damage it, it is the only one I have. I have several flywheels and a
&gt; flywheel lock.
&gt;
you keep it from spinning the same way by using a long bar with couple
holes in it to match the holes in the flex plate

BUT, the flexplate uses the 5 recessed bolt design and is not torqued all
that high, I have always been able to get the torque up to spec without
having to do anything special to hold it.

&gt; &gt;do you plan on putting the engine in a manual tranny bus???
&gt;
&gt; Not a chance because it has a flexplate. I really would not mind swapping
&gt; out my Auto for a Five Speed(HeHe). But considering I have only driven this
&gt; bus a few blocks I would like to try out the Auto and see what it is like
&gt; before I go through all the hassel. Anybody that has their heart set on an
&gt; Auto and want to trade for 4 speed manual? 5 speed?

lot of work to swap, easier to buy a different bus
&gt;
&gt; &gt;they are not interchangable
&gt;
&gt; Sure enough that seems to be the case. Like Hyd. lifters with a solid cam,

not interchangeable in the sense of putting flywheel in auto or flexplate
in manual tranny bus, but the engines are interchangeable with the
appropriate changes

&gt; or solid cam with hydraulic lifters, knees and elbows, oil and sand, etc.
&gt; That is why I said I was too lasy, but if I needed to I could swap the
&gt; flywheel for the flexplate just to use the flywheel lock. Didn't mean to

nope can't do that either, the end play is specific to the particular
combination of crank/case/flexplate or flywheel.  if you set it for one
and swap they are likely not the same setting and could cause probles

&gt; sound like I didn't know the difference, although still learning everyday
&gt; about these automatics.

as one VW mechanic said when I drove in my auto bus.

 &quot;OH, you have the other one&quot;

not that few but they are not exactly common
