Subject: RE: [T2] Need outdoor cover for camper

Same situation here in the City of Cookeville. Glad I'm in the county.

Let them tow it, then raise a stink since it is tagged. Maybe use a BIG &quot;Sharpie&quot; to write the tag number where the tag would be on the outside of the cover. Might keep the cover from being a theft item too as you have personalized it. 

When they do tow - be sure to call the Mayor's office directly, the Police to report a theft, and the paper... 

DUMB law with good intentions.
