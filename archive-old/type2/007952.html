&gt;3. Use Sears GripDoctor.  It works!
&gt;
&gt;   Tried it and the screws came out without effort.  This is simply
&gt;   a liquid with metal particles in suspension.  When used, these
&gt;   bits of metal fill in the gaps between the screwdriver and screw,
&gt;   causing the screwdriver to get a better grip.
&gt;
&gt;   Don't see why it would not work on your bolts as well.
&gt;
&gt;Good luck!

I'm in the Air Force and we use this stuff all the time on our aircraft, 
works great on Phillips head screws. If this does not work its time to 
drill.
