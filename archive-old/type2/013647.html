Subject: Re: [T2] ceramic coating

all this talk about ceramic coating of mufflers/headers has gotten me 
thinking:

How much of the cooling system relies on good heat transfer properties
of the header/muffler system, and, how does ceramic coating effect these
HT properties.

I'm guessing that the header/muffler system probably only accounts for 
2-7%
of all cooling (as a wild guess) but given that most of us bus owners 
are trying
our darnedest to make our engines cool BETTER, I think I'd rather replace
the exhaust every 18-24 months.   This, of course, depends on a number of
factors (how much money you have, if you live in a hot climate and need 
every
extra bit of cooling, how much time you have, etc.), but...

Have you volks with ceramic coatings noticed any difference in how hot
your busses run *now* after changing to a coated exhaust?

Intrigued,
