Subject: [T2] Motor Home Plates ---- Ohio Listees Only Please

Hello All,
    I was hoping some of my fellow Ohio Listees could help me out.  I got into a huge discussion at work last week about the benefits of having Motor Home plates on my Westy.  I was under the assumption that with the Motor Home designation my rear seat passengers would be able to consume alcohol, without getting me an open container citation.  I also thought that the Westy would be considered a home and be protected under search and seizure part of the constitution.
    Don't get me wrong... I'm not transporting anything illegal or drinking and driving.  I just wanted to know if my buddies could drink in the back without getting me a open container violation.  Also was hoping to find some way to verify my assumption, like the specific part of the vehicle code that covers the topic.  Something I can show to the guys at work and to prove to myself that I didn't waist the extra money it cost me to get my motor home plates.
 
See you down the road...
