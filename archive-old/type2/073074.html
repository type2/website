&gt;&gt; I'd agree that in really cold weather, the flaps might not always be
&gt;&gt; fully open. But I see absolutely no difference in head temp from the
&gt;hottest
&gt;&gt; day to the coldest day, once the engine is warmed up, with flaps in
&gt;place
&gt;&gt; but no thermostat.
&gt;
&gt;I find this result surprising!

I do too, and it would surprise me if it worked that way with a thermostat
as well. The (limited) experiments we did with VW thermostats argued that
they depend for their opening on the boiling point of some sort of alcohol
which is inside the bellows, and open/closed is pretty much a binary state
with the thermostat. It cannot be made to sustain a half open state,
although in cold ambient temperatures it might cycle open and closed--which
ought to cause swings in the head temp.
