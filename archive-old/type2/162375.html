&gt; 2) Which tire do you recommend me , hankook Ra08 185R14 or Michelin

&gt; weather.

I ski and have always used the Michelins, have the Agilis 81's on my 78
van at the moment. they have NEVER left me stuck even got home in the
&quot;great&quot; blizzard of 95? when WV didn't bother plowing thier roads.  the're
not as good as studs but the next best thing. (IMO)

usually the alignment specs are in the Bentley
