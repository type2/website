Subject: Re: [T2] Tape Deck for My 79

&gt;Beyond the garage sale circuit, can anyone recommend a starting point for
&gt;finding a good new or used cassette deck for my 79 bus?  I have a Sony in
&gt;there but the tape deck portion has since ceased to operate, and I'd rather
&gt;not replace it with another Sony due to the crappy luck I've had with that
&gt;brand's products.  I don't want to deal with any of the fancy newish
&gt;stereos, as they seem now to require more complicated multiple ground wiring
&gt;and no one seems to make straight simple tape decks anymore anyway.  I'm
&gt;assuming an older Blaupunkt might fit and work....does anyone know of any
&gt;other brands of tape decks that will go right into the stock radio hole for
&gt;a 79?

Best Buy, Circuit City, K-mart, Pep Boys and the like.

www.partsexpress_dot_com is VERY good - often with $5 speakers (new). I have 
done alot of business with them. I got a flyer the other day (in my e-mail) 
that listed 5&quot; round speakers for $5!!! I bought 4 in-house stereo speakers 
for $25 last year. Decent rear channel speakers that originally came with a 
middle cost RCA stereo as found at the above retailers.
