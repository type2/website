From: &quot;Andrew Strom&quot; &lt;the-andyman518_at_charter_dot_net&gt;
&gt; I'll be interested to hear any responses to this too, as I'll need a pair
of taillights pretty soon.  Thanks.

If they're resin cast and they've been properly cured, they should be fairly
durable.  I'd be interested in any feedback on this topic, too.

If anyone ever figures out how to successfully take apart a (spare!) `77 bay
taillight lens into it's component parts without damaging them and sends it
to me for a pre-repro'ing inspection, I'll repro that person a set for free
when the molds are ready.

When I changed a bulb recently I was disappointed to finds that the
taillight lens is actually a clear back with three attached lenses on the
front of it.  To be honest, I don't want to risk taking apart one of the two
on my bay.

But if anyone out there has a spare one that they're not averse to trying
the above on, let me know.  I can repro the other lenses on the bus without
much problem, but the taillight lens has me stymied.
