&gt; It's Friday and I need some feedback on the following.  I've posted
this
&gt; from work but you should post your response to the list, provided the
&gt; admistrator doen't mind.  

Steve probably won't mind as long as the topic stops at 00:00 Sat.!

&gt; There was quite an exchange on the type2 list a while back where
people were
&gt; discussing how fast do you drive in your type II.  One of the things
that
&gt; concerned people was the idiots going by far faster than the 1600cc
vans
&gt; could go and how to safely drive in those conditions.

Personally, I think that this is a non-issue.  I really don't feel
threatened by folks passing from behind.  The major hazard involved is
people making unsafe passing maneuvers.  This happens now and then,
but a good eye on the mirrors now and then will let you anticipate the
creative passers.

&gt; I'd like your
&gt; thoughts about the following:
&gt; 
&gt; As some of you may know I am a ham radio operator and as such have a
license
&gt; to put experimental transmitters on the air (up 1500 watts!!). 
Mostly we
&gt; talk on the short wave frequencies to people around the world, but
the hams
&gt; also have frequencies that range from 1.8 mhz (just above the
broadcast
&gt; band) to 24 ghz (microwave).  I am in the very early design stages in
&gt; developing a rearward looking radar that could warn a slow moving
driver of
&gt; fast approaching cars from behind.  Said unit would beep when it
detected
&gt; cars approaching at a high speed differential.

Sounds like an interesting device, but aren't you going after a fairly
low-danger situation?  To a car approaching at high speed, a bus is
just about a stationary object.

&gt; I have noticed that many of the speeders whizzing past me have radar
&gt; detectors on their visor...I should be able to trip the idiots radar
detectors,
&gt; thus slowing them down.

If all you want to do is trip detectors, you can go to a very low
power transmitter.  The number of drivers using detectors varys
considerably by region.  You would have little effect on California
speeders, as few use detectors.

&gt; The current problem that's bugging me is that some police radar
units have
&gt; the ability to detect intentional jamming....but I wonder
&gt; what the patrolman on the street might think.

Depends upon the patrolman, and most of them aren't all that
knowledgeable about RF design.  As far as they are concerned, if their
equipment says you are a bad guy, then you are a bad guy.  Is it
really worth the hassle to slow down a few fast drivers?

I consider the speed demons to actually be providing a useful public
service, by driving ahead at speeds that will occupy the roadside
gendarme while I drive safely pass at more moderate speeds.

BTW, due to its shape, a VW bus is just about the perfect radar
reflector.  If you are driving side by side with a more &quot;conventional&quot;
vehicle and you fall into the sights of a radar unit, you can just
about be sure that you are being clocked.  The radar signiture of most
other vehicles is much smaller than a bus.

Personally, I worry very little about getting tickets in my bus.  Cops
just won't believe that it is capable of speeding! :)
