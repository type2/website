Subject: Re: [T2] removing camper equipment - 76

Hello Cristopher

There are a few things that you have to remove in order to get the fridge
out, of course it will depend on what kind of camper do you have, mine is a
1977 Westfalia Helsinki:

1. Remove the rear bench, there are some bolts and nuts (bottom 14 or 17 mm,
sides 10mm and rear over the engine compartment 14 mm)

2. Remove the top shelf (bolts 10mm on top and sides)

3. Remove the closet Philips screws, there are some screws coming from the
fridge compartment four of them that secure the fridge cabinet.

4. There is at least one bolt that goes trough the sink cabinet to the
fridge.

5. Now you could be able to remove the fridge cabinet.

6. Remove all the bolts, nuts and screws from the sink cabinet, then take
out the plumbing and sink connections and it is done.

That is the way I took ( as far as I can remember) maybe is a better way I
only did once but work very fine to me.

From the sunny lands of Caracas Venezuela, Happy Thanksgiving day to the
