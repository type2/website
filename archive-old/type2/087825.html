Subject: Re: [T2] occasional smokey start

OK, so it sounds like I need to pull the engine and do at least a partial
rebuild.  I've never done either, but I don't mind learning how.  What
should I approximately expect to pay for all the necessary rebuild parts?  I
need to have a general idea as to what this will cost before I attempt it.

Thanks,
Brian
