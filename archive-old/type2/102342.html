Subject: Re: [T2] removing &quot;extra&quot; bits?

Please don't don't trash (toss it) any of it, offer it to the list instead...

The duct work can be removed all over. The heater boxes can be replaced 
with simple pipes. You'll need to seal any holes in the tin that leads from 
the top of the engine to under the engine so you do recirculate heated air.

If you remove the heater boxes plug the air outlets on the bottom of the 
fan shroud.

All the flapper boxes can come off.

I think the flat plates between the heater boxes and block need to stay to 
keep road spray (wet roads) off of the engine.

What if you plan to drive to Montana? &lt;grin&gt;

Good luck.



&gt;While setting my valves, etc., I couldn't help but notice (ouch!) a few 
&gt;bits and pieces that me and my 1976 2Ltr. bus might be able to do without.
&gt;
&gt;Dirt-catching things seemingly related to cabin heating, which we don't 
&gt;need in the tropics. Sheet metal plates and ducts at either side of the 
&gt;engine, plastic box with small fan and hoses next to the air filter, flex 
&gt;hose under the chassis, cable for little doors, etc.
&gt;
&gt;Can some of this stuff go, in the interest of keeping things clean and 
&gt;tidy? Anything need to be plugged afterward?
