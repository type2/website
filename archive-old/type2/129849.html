Subject: FW: [T2] What is best program to make a website?

It depends on how much time you would like to put into it.  Some hosting
companies include easy-to-use websites where you can tell them what to make
you site look like.  If you you have a little more time, you can set up
sites such as mine www.wical_dot_com or fasterlaster's site which is similar.
PM me if you like and I can get more into the details.  Im sure others will
post a few more options you may have.
