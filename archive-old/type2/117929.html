Subject: RE: [T2] Bus Memorabilia

&gt;Picked up the latest issue of VW Trends at the bookstore the other
&gt;day and it showed a bay window hot wheels car.  I was so happy until
&gt;I read the caption.  It's one of the most collectible hot wheels
&gt;cars ever and was last auctioned at a price that was tens of
&gt;thousands of dollars.

I keep thinking to myself that it must be a misprint. Didnt the article say 
$70,000? Thats more than any REAL bus has ever sold for AFAIK.

Can someone verify this?
I may need to spend more time at goodwill!
