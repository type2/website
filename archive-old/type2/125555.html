Subject: Buses Of The Corn Pics

Hi Volks,

I'm back from a great family Vacation in the westfakia, starting off 
with Buses Of The Corn in Whitby Ontario, camping with the Auch Family 
in Brocto NY for a few days mid-week at Lake Erie State Park and ending 
it at Dixie Bus Gathering in Mt. Vernon Ohio. Our family had a great 
time at both events and we are already looking forward to our next 
cross-border road trip to John Browns Buses.

I'll post my typically verbose trip report soon, but for now I will 
treat you with some pics from BOTC. Just go to www.busesofthecorn_dot_com 
and there's a link to my pics and NCbus Chris Cybulski's.


Happy trails,

Greg Potts
