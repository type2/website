Hey Chris
we used ours a lot with our 70. Two things seemed to make it work. We had
the the metal rack that held the block of ice and we had a fresh drain hose
so it didnt leak out the door. Packed it like you would a cooler and ice
would last 2-3 days. Also keep a second cooler for drinks so we wern't
oprning it all the time.
