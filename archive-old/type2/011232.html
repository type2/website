Forgive me for not having caught the whole thread, but its 'OK' for 74 type4
heads to run a lead additive if i want, right?

Q#2:
Showing my engine off at a party a few weeks ago i demonstrated to my friend
how rich i was running (2bbl weber prog +009)by letting the little spits of
'black water'(unburnt hyds and condensation)  coming out of the end of the
tailpipe collect on my hand.
He (an old ch_at_vy builder)suggested a less restrictive exhaust system may help
to remedy this and keep me from having to tweak the carb too much  -i'd like
not to mess with it - listmember s. lashley and his mechanic did a bunch of
trial and error rejetting on it while he had it to get it running the best he
could - which is pretty good from what i can gather.
Should i replace my ailing stock 74 system with an extractor or something?

thanks,
clark gordon
