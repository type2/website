&gt; Hi!
&gt;
&gt; I'm desperately in need of some help. I have a 1978 Transporter.

&gt; transmission. After much trying, I found speed &quot;3&quot;, and had to hold it
&gt; in that position till reaching home, and unable to change to any other

&gt; speed.
&gt; (Sorry, if there is any confusion with my wording - I'm hungarian,
&gt; with limited english in automotive topics)
&gt;

snipped
 What should be the problem? And how can I repair it?
 Can anybody refer me to some webpage to see how should I uninstall the
 transmission system, and repair it, then put it back again?
 Or I would welcome any help by mail too - am only asking to please use
 regular words for parts and tools, or try to explain it to me, as the
 words used in automotive-repair texts are many times nonexisting ones
&gt; in my dictionary :(
&gt; I did much repair work on my bus, this is not a problem, but need
&gt; words even your wife or mom would understand :)
&gt; Thanks!
