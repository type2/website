Subject: Re: [T2] Leaking fluid...


Just verify the lube is clean and up to level. Check level from time to 
time to verify rate of loss. If you get to where you have to add a half 
pint every six months, just keep the level up and you won't burn up the 
gears and bearings from loss of lube. Then plan for a reman tranny in the 
next year, or at least an inspection and replacement of seals, before you 
have to top up a half pint every 3 months. Plan to service the clutch and 
flywheel if inspection says so. Plan to service the CV's/boots at the same 
time and now your getting efficientcy for the labor. Just a few hours added 
to a tranny R&amp;R can add a bunch of value to long range results.

Before removing either the fill or drain plug, clean the built up gunk from 
inside the hex and around the perimeter. Do take care not to let crud get 
into the open hole.

&gt;Well I made it back from EveryBus but
&gt;at my last stop an hour from home I noticed I was leaking fome fluid.
&gt;So first thing I checked the oil.
&gt;Oil was down no more than normal.
&gt;I sniffed the fluid and it smelled like transaxle fluid.
&gt;It was leakin at a dripping pace from what looked like the area where the 
&gt;engiene and tranny mount together. It was dim and raining so I did not 
&gt;investigate at great length.
