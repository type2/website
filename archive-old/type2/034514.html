Subject: Re: torque.. long

I strongly disagree with the recommendation below for stock applications.
Perhaps it's appropriate for high-performance engines as Zac stated, but
aren't we then talking about increasing engine life from 2 races to 3?

As your engine heats up, the torgue you've applied is multiplied. I can't
remember where I read about over-torquing (Hoover, I *think*), but 10 lbs.
translates into A LOT more when the engine heats up. In aluminum cases,
such as the Type IVs, maybe a little more torque wouldn't hurt, but in the
magnesium cased, I wouldn't overtorque case or head nuts.

I'm not a VW mechanic, but I've read often that the factory recommended
retorque at 300 miles. In fact that is what the 300 mile new car warranty
service was for!

Thanks! Joe

&gt;**side note.  to those of you who have higher performance engines, you
&gt;might want to read some of gene bergs material on increasing torque
&gt;values to prolong engine life.(the below mentioned things i have done
&gt;to BOTH 1600 dp and type iv bus motors).  personally i have raised the
&gt;6 main studs on the case 10 LBS.!!!!  the outer case sealing nuts
&gt;5lbs!! and the heads 5-10 lbs (depending on the application of the
&gt;motor)....never has a stud pulled on me.  i once took some old cases
&gt;that were cracked, split or where a rod blew threw...and tested how
&gt;far i could torque b4 a stud pulled.  the six main studs consistently
&gt;torqued to 50 + lbs some were much higher.  i do not claim to know all
&gt;the physics of the implications of this...but i could go into details
&gt;of my personal experiences on how I THINK this has helps my motors. 
&gt;all of bergs motors get it done.  (and whether you agree with all the
&gt;companies practices...most agree they only sell stuff that works and
&gt;stand by their ideas).  just a thought.
&gt;
&gt;back to the subject...most say to re-torque after 5-10k.  i would
&gt;really like to hear from a vw guy and learn what they used to
&gt;recommend from the factory.  about 50/50 of the time i have done it. 
&gt;and in those times i retorqed (checked) all the nuts.
&gt;
&gt;any other thoughts folks??
&gt;
&gt;zzz
