Andy asked:

&gt; In England and much of Europe, if you're on a proper camp site you probably
&gt; can't light a fire anyway, other than a BBQ. If not you'd be sufficiently in
&gt; the wilderness to gather your own wood on arrival, if you think a fire is
&gt; necessary. Me, I've never lit a fire when out in my camper. Do other people
&gt; do this?

Regularly, though not usually in July in Florida. :-)  Our state parks
sell firewood at the park office; it's not too dear and beats having to
carry it -- although they've run out before, which bites.  I've noticed
in the Georgia state parks the &quot;campground host&quot; (as opposed to park
ranger) usually stocks and sells it.

Some parks don't mind you collecting deadfall but others do.

OTOH, I was a Boy Scout and I have a fireplace, so I've usually got
firewood at home and like to split wood, so usually I'll take about 1
milk-crate worth for a two-nighter; more if it's really cold (remember:
Florida).  Roof rack is a good place to keep it but ya gotta have a bin
of some sort -- I'd say over the engine compartment is the best spot if
you have a lot.  Plus you get company in the form of all those beetles
and spiders from the woodpile.  Last April when it turned bitter cold in
Jacksonville after Busses on the Beach I was mighty glad I'd brought
some.

If I had to carry more I think I'd see that as a sign I should stay home
that weekend. ;-)  Generally my fires are mostly for atmosphere &amp; a
little warmth, though when we go camping at the family tree farm in
January we tend to build bonfires.  Roast on one side, freeze on the
other.

I liked Bob Perring's suggestion about firelogs -- I've done that as
well in a pinch; easily available if there's a store nearby.  Also a
GREAT suggestion for having a &quot;fire&quot; in the BBQ pit.
