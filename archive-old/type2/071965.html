&gt;I've been reconfiguring my rebuilt 2 liter engine (again) and its
&gt;almost ready.  I reinstalled everything with a CB Performance torque
&gt;cam and lifters and now I need a new oil pump.  I think I've read here
&gt;on the list that I can use a type 1 oil pump.  Any body have experience
&gt;with this swap?  I'd like to use a heavy duty oil pump with an aluminum
&gt;body.  Any body know of a good brand to go with?

I would not use a type 1 pump because I'm not sure it's a straight swap -
are you?  Make real sure before you do that of course.  Melling used to
make a high volume type IV pump for about $60 - I didn't really notice a
difference with it but I'm sure it didn't hurt.
