Subject: Wasserboxer conversion versus aftermarket type 1 aluminum case
  versus type 4

I've started to hear more about the use of wasserboxer cases for aircooled
applications.  Apparently, the wasserboxer case is very close to the
design of the type 1 case with the addition of the water jacket.  Major
differences are:

Larger oil sump
No oil screen plate
5-bolt flywheel attach
wider spacing on cylinder studs
cast-in oil filter boss
no oil cooler boss
all-aluminum for greater strength and longevity.

The conversion to aircooled involves cutting off the water jacket, hooking
up an oil cooler, and modifying the cylinder stud spacing to the type 1
spec with offset inserts.  Apparently, the tin is just about a bolt-on
proposition.

Considering some of the trials and tribulations suffered by those trying
to use the aftermarket aluminum type 1 cases, the conversion effort
doesn't seem like too much.  The advantage is that you get an aluminum
bottom end that was engineered in Der Fatherland and actually functioned
in its watercooled state.

The one critical mod seems to be the narrowing of the cylinder studs.  I
wonder if it would be feasable to alter the holes in the heads rather than
machining and installing the offset inserts required to narrow the
spacing.  the cylinders wouldn't care if the spacing was a bit large than
normal.

Of course, one might question the desire to build an wasserboxer-case type
1 when the type 4 engine is available in similar stock displacements.
