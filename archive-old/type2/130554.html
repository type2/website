&gt;1) Have any of you done this?  How effective has it been? Any suggested 
&gt;kits?
&gt;
&gt;2) I am mounting it to a pop-top that I still want to pop.  I planned on 
&gt;doing it above the hinges so that the weight is not multiplied by the 
&gt;leverage of the roof.  The model I am looking at is 30 lbs.  If most of that 
&gt;weight is over the hinges, would it damage/bend them?
&gt;
&gt;3) What would you reccommend in terms of mounting to the fiberglass?  Also 
&gt;any reccommendations for wiring the cable through?

A good person to ask these question to would be Sami Dakhlia:
