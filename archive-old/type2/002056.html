Hey Volks,
On the VIN thread:
I learned the hard way, I bought a 76 bus with funky windows that turned out
to be an 81 from Mexico. I didn't notice that the title said &quot;1976 station
wagon&quot;. When I tried to get it emission tested here in South Florida, the
problems began. To make a long story short, I had to deal with DMV for
months and months with no progress. It turns out that the guy I bought it
from had recently bought it from a recently deceased police officer who had
ileagally imported it from Mexico. He apparently swapped the dash VIN w/a
station wagon,but the VIN in the engine compartment told the story to the
State of Florida. I was able to get a 30 day temporary tag and took her on
tour in '92.
we ended up pulling the engine on the side of the road in Swannanoa NC(in
the rain,with a tarp over the rear end:-)but thats another story. When I got
back to Fl the red tape seemed hopeless so I sold her to my mechanic(at a
huge loss) who thought he could get a clear title via a mechanics lein
(nope, she was from mexico)
Moral of the story is &quot;Don't do it if she ain't legal, it'll cost you down
the road.&quot;

Now, my buddy Jose(jrms_at_mediaone_dot_net)is selling his 81 Westy
30,000 miles on the rebuilt 2.0, all the goodies(stove,fridge,
tables,etc...) work fine. Canvas is in good shape, a small tear in the
screen. he has pictures available so email him directly. He is asking
$4500.00...

I  drove this bus 900 miles this fall and not one problem occured, which was
and still is a record for me and roadtrips in VW's...

Meanwhile my '76 is having rust cut out and new metal welded in, I  hope to
have her painted within two weeks. My budget is getting thin so does anyone
have an opinion as to how a low budget paintjob may turn out? Is it
imperative that I remove the poptop or can I just tape that off?

Thanks,
Andy  '76 Westy
