Volks,
This is a very friday thing, and i hope i don't get slammed for it but i don't
get on line fridays very much and wanted to pass this along...

A member of the vintagebus list posted about a vwbus playtent seen in a retail
place in SF.  I emailed the company and this is what they told me.

Seems like a great bus thing for those of us with small children.

 Hi,
 
 I heard you have a 'playhut' that is designed to resemble and early
(1949-1966) Volkswagen Transporter or &quot;Bus&quot;.
 
 I searched your site and did not find it.
  
 Someone i know said they saw one (a 'playhut' that resembled a VW bus - not
the 'school bus') at a retail establishment that was manufactured by your
company.
 
 Can you verify?  I am a VW enthusiast and would love to inflict this hobby
upon my young son in the form of your VWbus 'playhut'. 
 
 Thanks,

&quot;...and in and out of weeks and almost over a year to where the wild things
are.&quot;
