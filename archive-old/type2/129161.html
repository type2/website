&gt;I think you are on the right track by checking everything, but if you
&gt;have one of the SVDA's from aircooled_dot_net I was told to time them
&gt;vacuum hooked up at 7.5 degrees BTDC, what instructions did you time
&gt;these to?
&gt;
&gt;also you shouldn't have an AFM w/ carbs, this might be your problem
&gt;(hehe). BTW what do the plugs look like? do you think you might have
&gt;the kads setup way to rich?
&gt;  
&gt;
The instructions that John (aircooled_dot_net) e-mailed me about the SVDA 
timing say,
      &lt;begin quote&gt;
&quot;To verify the correct operation of the SVDA, the timing should be

A) 7.5 at idle
B) 32 Total Advance (hose disconnected)_at_ 3500 RPM.
C) 42-45 Total Advance (hose connected)_at_ 3500 RPM.

If the A and B timing settings vary, go with the B setting (at 3500 RPM) 
to set your timing. Full centrifugal advance is more important then the 
idle timing.&quot;
     &lt;end quote&gt;

By &quot;AFM&quot; I meant air-fuel mixture -- tweaking the mixture screws on the 
carbs. Sorry -- did I use &quot;AFM&quot; incorrectly?

I could use a pointer to a bunch of pictures of what spark plugs should 
look like when the mixture is correct. Is there such a thing on the web?
