Subject: Re: [T2] Brake servo rebuild kit?

It very difficult to impossible for you to rebuild your booster yourself,
even if you could find the parts, which it is unlikely that you would be
able to.

I recommend that you get it rebuilt.  I recommend H&amp;R auto parts rebuilders
in Dallas, Texas:

H &amp; R Auto Parts Rebuilders =A0
10328 Oakwood Dr, Dallas, TX 75217
Phone: (972) 286-5516


Mine cost $81 including shipping and they did it the day they got it and
sent it back the next day.


&gt; To my great dismay it seems like my booster isn't working right. My probl=
em
&gt; - when I apply the brake I get an instant increase in idle, leading to an
&gt; eventual stall.  Sounds just like a massive vacuum leak.  All my lines,
&gt; hoses, etc. are new/and or in great shape. Everything is tight.  I know t=
he
&gt; servo is a pricey bit of metal (200 and up for a rebuilt one, near 400 fo=
r a
&gt; new one...lol), so I've been thinking of rebuilding it.  How hard is this=
?
&gt; Should I just opt for the rebuild, close my eyes and grab my wallet?  I'v=
e
&gt; got access to a garage, proficient mechanical skills, so I figure I could=
 do
&gt; the rebuild on my own. Plus I might learn something.  But is there a kit =
out
&gt; there?  I can't seem to find one...  Any input would be greatly appreciat=
ed
&gt; by both me and my unstoppable bus.
