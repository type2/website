&gt; &gt; It appears that http://www.wolfsburgwest_dot_com/ has bentleys in stock. The
&gt; &gt; price is $32.00 cheaper then the $34.95 price on amazon (2 - 5
&gt; &gt; week wait) and cheaper then the $39.95 price on bentley's website.

&gt; 
&gt; Ah, but my price is $27.95, which is cheaper than $32.00 and cheaper than
&gt; $34.95 and cheaper than $39.95.  :-)
&gt; Add a few tune-up parts or whatever to get your order to $50 and the 5%
&gt; listmember discount kicks in as well.
&gt; My part number V279.
