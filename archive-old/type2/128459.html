Subject: Re: [T2] Dipstick Thermometer at WalMart?

Another good idea---

But why?

The turkey thermometer isn't going to tell you guys anything--except
what oil temp the engines is running at while it's sitting there
idling--

Not real important info to be pondering on--


 
Thermometer at WalMart? 
I may pick one up. Not to leave in there though, but to be able to
perform a quick check. Just swap for a few moments to get a reading,
then swap back. 
I wouldn't trust the display to be able to handle the heat and vibration
in a bus engine compartment.
