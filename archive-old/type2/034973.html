Subject: RE: Mystery window hose

Justin,

There is a plastic hose attached to the bottom of the window winder
mechanism that the bendy cable/spring (what do you call that thing) goes
into when the window is down.  Is this what you are describing?
You will never be able to stop rain from getting into the door, that's why
VW punched a big hole in the bottom.  Make sure this hole is clear of debris
and the water will run out.  The door is well enough ventilated to dry out
reasonably quickly.  While you have the panel off, it's a good idea to give
the inside of the door a good coating of rustproofer - I use Waxoyl, you may
be able to get it or something similar.  Give the wheel arch the same
treatment - there is a hole in the top next to the seat that you can spray
the stuff through until it runs out of the drain hole in the bottom.

&gt; rainwater found its way through either the door or window rubber and
&gt; collected at the bottom of the door - mustering force to eat 
&gt; its way out.
&gt; This being, for the last week or so I and my trusty Dremel 
&gt; tool have been
&gt; attacking the cancer.  Today, I decided to get a better angle 
&gt; at the bottom
&gt; panels - so I removed the door panel... and lo!  There's some 
&gt; funky rubber
&gt; tube/hose (approx. 1/2&quot; in diam.) which begins somewhere near 
&gt; the window and
&gt; is confusingly left open to vent, drip or whatever its 
&gt; supposed to do, right
&gt; into the bottom of the door.
