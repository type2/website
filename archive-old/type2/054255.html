&gt;&gt; As I recall, VW offered a diesel version of the Vanagon.

Tobin Copley has a nice diesel Vanagon he picked up in CA.  It IS slower
than all get out but it gets nearly 25mpg around town and 30+ at highway
speeds.  Very reliable too!  I wish someone would figure out how to put
a 90 hp TDI with a 5-speed in a bay.  That would have plenty of power and
probably get a least 35 mpg on trips...
