Hi Volks
just wanted to add my .02. There is a product I used to sell in the watercraft
biz called fyrebuoy which is an automatic halon extinguisher. It is mounted in
the engine compartment and if a fire starts, sensor melts, halon goes off and
light on dash goes on. I read were someone had called the comp. and been told
that they were designed for enclosed areas and would dissipate in the open.
Correct, they were designed for watercraft where fighting a fire while you
bobbed in the water would be difficult at best. Note!! they said enclosed, not
airtight, the volume of our engine compartments is apx the same as the average
watercraft and they ain't airtight. I've used halon on carb fires before
(don't ask) and if its anywhere near the fire out it goes.With the additives
in gas doing their best to destroy our fuel lines, its up to us to protect our
busses
Chuck
