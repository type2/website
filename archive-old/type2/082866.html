Subject: RE: Message to VWoA &amp; MVVC

&gt;&gt;They *did*...I don't understand it either, but 
they also got MICROBUS!

It's easy.  They CAN trademark anything they
want... beetle, bug, microbus, bus, tree, mickey
mouse, batman, water, air, VW, ABC, CBS, XYZ or
anything they want.  The question of whether or
not they can defend that trademark is one for
litigation.  Who is going to foot the bill to
defend &quot;bus&quot;?

Peace and blessings,
