At the risk of sounding facetious, I have to say that
we haven't paid over $3000 for a vehicle since we
bought a new F*rd Ec*n*l*ne van in 1971, or rather my
soon-to-be-wife (didn't know her yet, though) bought
it because the VW dealer wouldn't sell her a new van,
because, he said, a girl wouldn't want something that
big. Of course it is long gone and we since have
purchased many cheap old VWs, but the only one with
over $3000 invested in it is the 65 Doublecab which
would not be my first choice for a long trip for
reasons other than value or cost.
I usually drive $50 cars, but with inflation they
usually cost $300 to $500 today!

65 double cab  
75 bus
and a bunch of cheap water cooled drivers for winter
I suppose I might have more than $3000
