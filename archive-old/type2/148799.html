Subject: Re: [T2] i need some winter driving tips

&lt;&lt;I was up there when I was a kid , and -55 below was the norm. 
With or without the windchill ;-)?&gt;&gt;

This was back in 66--to 69 
They didn't bother measuring windchill
back then.

I'll tell ya what--spit and it was frozen before it hit the ground---: )
 
&lt;&lt; put the automatic into 2nd when starting on ice because there's less
torque,..&gt;&gt;

Her's what ya gotta do--if your going through a corner on the ice and
the back end starts sliding--hit the throttle--power through the
corner--the back end will follow you.

I'll try this neutral stop thing today--see what happens.

&lt;&lt;With most automatics I've got experience with (not sure about the VW
automatic) selector in 2nd gear means the trans starts in 2nd gear, and
never shifts out of 2nd gear.&gt;&gt;

No--the trans doesn't have a lock out like in a late model GM trans.

It'll always start in first, shift to second, and hold there.
