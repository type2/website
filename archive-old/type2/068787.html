1. Is the rear seat unique to the doublecab? If so, how hard will it be
to find one.. I do have the metal frame that the seat sits on..

I believ it is unique to the doublecab

2. Will the 1/3 2/3 bench seat work in the front seat area. I know it
originally came with a full length bench seat (and I will find one
eventually) but I do have an extra front seat set-up from a 64..

A 61 has a different kind of seat attachment bracket on the body than a 63
and later split.   This means the 2/3 , 1/3  type seat combo  will not attach
to your body.   You need to find the full length bench seat.
