Subject: Going Cross Country too

Hello Everyone,

Well I finally got my van back on the road last night after it sat for over 3 weeks 
waiting for parts from Vancouver (some moron in the shipping dept. sent them to 
Manning Park B.C. not Manning, ALBERTA where I am).  For anyone who 
remembers, I lost third gear, then reverse.  I finally ordered new bushings and shift 
coupler and installed it - everything is just peachy now :)  Thanks again to all who 
replied to my plea for help.  

So anyway, I'll be done work up here in about 3 week and then I'm hitting the road 
again.  I'm stopping in Edmonton to have some motor and brake work done and then 
i'm going south.  I'm getting sick of winter up here - we had frost already last night !! 
Yuck ! If anyone had some suggestions of places to visit on the West Coast I might be 
interested in hearing from you.  I'll probably hang around southern B.C. for a week or 
so and then tour down the coast and maybe end up in AZ, TX or even Mexico if I 
have enough money.  As long as it's someplace warm!  Drop me a line.  Peace,

BTW: I probably should have included this above but I thought I'd ask since I have a 
message open:  OK - 2l FI motor, compression reads 110,110,55!,105. I know this 
isn't good.  What are some possible causes?  Dropped valve seat? I'm probably going to 
rebuild my motor, but I only want to do what's necesarry (and affordable) to keep me 
going for a while.  Do I just need new heads or what?  I've been happy to stay away 
from any major motor stuff but I think the time has come.  Any suggestions, comments 
etc. welcome.  TIA.
