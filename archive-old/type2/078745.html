Subject: Re: [T2] Nose welding/wrecked singlecab

I would try to get a good idea of where the factory spot welds are, use a 
spot weld bit and drill them out, and then use a good MIG or a spot weld 
attachment on a stick welder machine.

You maybe able to hire the welding reasonably priced out if you have it all 
prepared and stripped out.

Good luck.

Ciao!
