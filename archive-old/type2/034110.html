Subject: New Weber woes ....

I installed a new Weber today on my '72 with a 2.0L bus and I have to
say
I'm not impressed with the setup.

The intake tubes don't line up with the carb manifold holes by 1/4 to
1/2 inch
misalignment resulting on some stress on the connecting boots I don't
like.
The quality of the intake tubes looks cheap.

The directions require to throttle to be on the right side and the accel
cable is
on the left side. I had to mount the carb backwards to get the throttle
to hook up.

The plastic fitting supplied that screws into the carb manifold to hook
up the
power brake booster hose was too big and I had to make something work
temporarily.

I drove it about 10 miles to a parts store and back and there's some
pinging
that wasn't there and the thing ran really hot. There's no place to hook
up
the distributor vacuum retard. I'm thinking the vacuum advance isn't
working.

I'm wondering if they sold me the wrong carb.

Should this carb have fit better ?

Anybody have any suggestions or input ? Thanks
