Hi Volks,

while moving the Community of Interest T2 site to its new URL is 
still a work in progress (and proceeding slowly), I've uploaded scans 
of an 8/67 German T2 brochure.  Might be worth browsing even if you 
don't understand the German.  Very nice pictures of all the available 
body versions and all, 40 pages all told.  However, it's at

http://www.bulli_dot_org/t2ig/archive/brochure/6708-1/index.html

Enjoy!  And let me know what you think.

Yours,
    Erik.
