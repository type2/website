Subject: '71 bus Carrier Bolts

Whilst installing the engine in my '71 bus the small bolt from the rear 
carrier stripped and destroyed the threaded insert in the block. I asked 
the local VW guy who said 'no problem, it's only for alignment anyway, 
the two big bolts carry the weight.' For evidence, he said that  a lot of 
buses run with those oil pump cover adaptors which bolt to the carrier, 
and that's a lot flimsier than the two big bolts in mine.

Any opinions? I'd love to not have to drag my engine to a shop to get a 
new insert put in, but if it really matters I'll do it.

Whaddya you think?

Thanks,

Jon
'71 bus (desperately wanting its motor back)
