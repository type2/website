Subject: cops in the Pacific Northwest


Well, i gotta speak up here. As a west coaster (Or, CA, WA) for the last 15 
years, i have been pulled over in my bus for (1) obstructed rear window, 
which had a *few* stickers on it. In this case, the officer seemed to really 
want to shine a light in the back of my deadhead painted 71 and see if i had 
something illegal, which i didn't. (2) i was pulled over in the same bus 3 
times in 2 weeks for a taillight problem, which was a PITA to fix. (3) i was 
pulled over and ticketed in downtown SF for an illegal u-turn at 4 in the 
morning, but i was the only car within miles. so, out of all those 1 ticket 
isn't too bad. maybe if we keep the busses on the road as much as possible 
we can continue to appear as &quot;another old car&quot; in the policeman psyche.
  On the other hand, me and two buddies were pushing the '65 kombi down a 
main street in Vancouver WA and a policeman drove up behind us, turned on 
his lights, and provided an obstacle to cars coming up behind us till we 
cleared the corner - and we had no title, registration, insurance or 
anything on that bus, he never even stopped!  Lastly, my brother in law got 
a ticket last week in his 59 panel for speeding.. he was very proud that the 
cop thought such a thing was possible!
okay, enough random recollections
-jeremy
