Subject: more VIN numbers

With all the recent discussion on VIN numbers could someone help me with
the following:

02 024 222
414151 046 248 507
37 1 7199 DA 211011

What I know about older type IIs gets me no where with these numbers. The
only part looking remotely familiar is the second line, listing the M
codes.
