Subject: First post/PEI run

Well, hello to everyone on the list. I've been reading but not contributing 
for some time now and this proposed run through the maritimes has prompted 
me to post something. I had also been considering a trip to PEI (although 
it's a bit of a shorter drive from where I am in Halifax) and I always love 
the idea of meeting up with other VW owners. I'd definately be interested in 
a carabus (or caravanagon, in my case), so yeah, who else is interested?!
