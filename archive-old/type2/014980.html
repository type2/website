My '79 FI 2.0 has had the hydraulic valves taken out by the PO.  I have
kept them in adjustment since I have had the bus(2 yrs) but should I be
concerned about replacing for any reason other than convenience?

What would this entail in cost and labor?  
I am planning to pull the engine this summer.

TIA
