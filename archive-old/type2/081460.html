Subject: [T2] Removing ignition rotor

&gt;I'm venturing into the world of self-maintenance for the first time I'm
&gt;having a devil of a time getting the old ignition rotor off (rev limiting
&gt;variety 04016).  Is there a screw around the back or something?

Pull harder, there is no screw. Clean off the shaft and use anti-sieze
to prevent this problem in the future. Try two levers,it may break.
