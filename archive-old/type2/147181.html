&gt;So, to bring this argument to it's full, small circle, what do you do if you
&gt;don't have money and you want some parcel trays, and you enjoy being
&gt;creative?
&gt;  
&gt;
be creative!  i'd love to see what you come up with.  I'm not interested 
in spending $200 on parcel trays.  They are neat though.  DO what you 
want and don't let anyone talk down to you for it...Not that this is 
what Terry was trying to do.

my $0.02
