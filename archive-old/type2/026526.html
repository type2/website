&gt;When I bled the brakes the fluid was dark and I bled them until I got 
&gt;clear fluid. Do I need to bleed them more? What else could cause the 
&gt;soft pedal?  Pads and shoes are not worn. The only thing that is out of 
&gt;wack is the parking brake which will not hold even though I have 
&gt;adjusted it to the fullest extent. Could this be allowing the rear shoes 
&gt;to return too far?  

OH YEAH!!  You need to do a complete rear brake adjust.  

You can probably find a really good detailed write-up in the archives or
Muir's idiot book so I'm not going to take up time and bandwidth doing it
here.  The gist of it is to loosen your parking brake adjustment all the
way, jack up a rear wheel (you don't need to remove the tire), remove the
rubber plugs from the back side of the backing plate, and adjust the top and
bottom adjusting stars with a big screwdriver until the wheel starts to
drag.  Pump the brake pedal once or twice and check for drag again and
adjust some more as necessary.   Then do the other side.  When you're done,
re-adjust the parking brake and you'll have MUCH better and safer brakes AND
a working parking brake.
