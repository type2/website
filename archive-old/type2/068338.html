Subject: battery charging

I drive my 78 (type-IV, FI 2.0L) to work and back every day, a
whopping 3.5 miles each way.  For all you disgusted bicyclers on the
list, sue me, I'm lazy.  Anyway, this means I'm starting my bus twice
from cold every 7 miles.  Now that the weather's getting cold, the
battery is acting sluggish, no big surprise.

Here's the question: What's the shortest distance I need to drive each
weekend to charge my battery for the coming week?

Assume highway driving on the weekends, my alternator is working close
to it's normal capacity, whatever that is, and my bus fires up pretty
quickly--after say 5 or 6 revs, not cranking for minutes at a time.
&quot;Please show your work.&quot;  (Remember when your 4th grade math teacher
always warned you to show your work? ;-)

Thanks,
Rodney
