Hi. This is the qmail-send program at pon.type2_dot_com.
I'm afraid I wasn't able to deliver your message to the following addresses.
This is a permanent error; I've given up. Sorry it didn't work out.

&lt;Type2_at_type2_dot_com&gt;:
Your mail to the type2 list has been intercepted and is being
returned to you because it appears to the list server to
contain an excessive amount of quoted material.

Brief quoting is fine, but please quote only for context.
Do not quote other messages in their entirety, or quote
message headers or signature files.

&gt; Is it ridiculous to think these emails might be being stored somewhere
&gt; through Type2 - e.g. archives or the like - so that I don't have to store
&gt; all this now, in case I need such info later?  I'm obviously not very savvy
&gt; about the workings of cyberspace...but I don't want to delete things I might
&gt; want to know about later!

I save what I think will be usefull, and delete 99% the library has a lot
but usually not whatever your looking for at the moment

&gt; Also, can anyone explain to me why I just got a failure notice saying I
&gt; quoted too much, when I didn't quote anyone?  I'm sure I&quot;m misunderstanding
&gt; the comment, but it's confusing...

&gt;     T* UNSUBSCRIBE send any e-mail to: type2-unsubscribe_at_type2_dot_com
&gt;      T* email the admin for list help only: type2-admin_at_type2_dot_com
&gt;    F*r additional commands send any e-mail to: type2-help_at_type2_dot_com
&gt;  D*nations help keep the list going. http://www.type2_dot_com/donate.html

gotta delete the above quote or try to trick the autobot like I hope this
does
