Quite right. Proving the rebuilder did the job right often takes many thousands of miles of driving.

&gt;I later heard about 
&gt;rebuilders using tighter valve seat tolerances so that they didn't come 
&gt;loose as the factory heads had done.

Mark Stephens was known for doing this.

&gt;I don't know anything about AMC heads 
&gt;however, but I bet Ron wouldn't advertise his rebuilt heads as &quot;better than 
&gt;original&quot; if the valve seat tolerances hadn't been done correctly, and half 
&gt;the price. I for one would buy the rebuilt heads and save the money.

If you can find a good head without cracks that will incure high welding repair costs, it's a good way to go.

GoWesty! and other engine rebuilders are upgrading the AMC heads:

They naturally have engine warranties to protect and while they can probably get a replacement head, they lose too much money to R&amp;R the engine again for the customer so they improve the head and pass the a smaller cost along to them.

AMC produces a head casting and does some basic machining to it. It is the US importer that grinds the valve seats and installs the valves, springs and other hardware. The parts chosen vary in quality and cost as time goes by and occasionally as evidenced by the GoWesty! article one of those parts causes a head failure. Is it any greater a failure rate than any other mass produced part? Who knows. Those are just the facts. Many people are driving around with stock AMC heads without issue.

I written up a lot about head rebuilding problems at my website:
