Subject: re: ideas on a noisy differential

Steve has had his trannie overhauled on his '65 and since then it's not 
only noisy but it leaks under load.  The mechanic said that he had to 
&quot;reposition&quot; the crown gear and pinion and that the side plates may be 
warped.

Steve, here's my thoughts on the issue.  
1. The crown gear and pinion mesh is determined by some spacer gaskets 
and the mesh is critical to avoid noise although if the gear set has 
been worn severely, even proper mesh won't hush the whine.  On the 
positive side, if the bearings are good then usually the whine will get 
quieter after ten or twenty thousand miles.
2. You really shouldn't have any leakage from the side plates if they 
were properly installed with the correct amount of spacer gaskets.  Are 
you sure the grease isn't leaking from the flexible boots?  The matter 
of &quot;leaking under load&quot; is puzzling.

In any case, I think most owners would insist that the mechanic make 
the job right and take care of the leak, loaded or not.
