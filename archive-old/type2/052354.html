&gt; existing input shaft length. What is the story here? Is the length of the input shaft different for different years or is the bellhousing on the trannies different. If we can solve this by swapping a bell housing instead of cutting the shaft we would rather do that so as not to condemn tranny to type1hood forever. Please let us know!

Chris:
It's the shaft length, but if you can change bellhousings, you're only a
snap ring pliers and 10 minutes away from having the shaft out. A shaft
from an earlier 68-71 trans will fit and be the right length. Make sure
the replacement shaft is clean and smooth (not rusty) in the pilot
bearing area. Pilot bearings sometimes fail and ruin the input shaft.
Having said that, I really find it difficult to believe that you can't
find a type 4 engine or parts to put one together. Unless it has been
run out of oil, I've never seen a bottom end fail, regardless of its
mileage.
The top end always fails first. Heads are the biggest expense.1.7 or 1.8
heads will also work fine on a 2.0 engine, but the 1.7's need to be cut
to the larger diameter. Have this done by someone who's done it before
like Boston Bob or any other good VW machine shop. The bores have to be
absolutely in the same plane. Exhaust guides and valves should be
replaced.
Piston rings should be replaced, but very often I've reused pistons and
cylinders.
You could also look into the possibility of a  1.7 engine. Darn near any
combo will work with the correct modifications, most of which are not
expensive. There's a functional 73 engine here near my house in a
junkyard
that you could probably have for $250, but it's in Waterloo, Iowa.
If you're really that poor, maybe you should consider not doing it at
all, cause you've got  5 or 6 items to work out (besides the input
shaft) to make this conversion successful, and then it will always be an
inferior engine with a magnesium crankcase and less power, and if you
work it hard, it won't last very long.
