Subject: RE; Dipstick temperature sender

I too have a dipstick temp. sender with a bit of felt at the top.

I have no problems with oil coming out here. If I did I would suspect that my
crank case breather pipe was blocked and the oil was being forced out.

Before I fitted the gauge/sender I checked them out with some test wiring and 
put the dipstick into some hot/boiling water. I'm sure, with a little 
imagination, other types of senders could be similarly tested.
