Subject: engine on the floor in pieces...
Date: Tue, 22 May 2001 21:00:55 -0700
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

so my clutch was grabby and i pulled the engine ('75 1800 FI) and sure
enough the bottom of the bell housing was full of asbestos dust (and the
disk was worn quite a bit)... since i had the engine out i decided to take
off the exhaust (and drop it on my pinky) so i could take off the tin and
fan housing and clean everything up and figure out where the front oil leak
was coming from... oil leak was definitely coming from the front seal so
that's no problem... but then i had several hours with nothing to do so i
thought what the hell i'll take off the heads and cylinders and inspect...
heads are great, if dirty... and the cylinders and pistons look great too
buuuuttt....

i was thinking of replacing the rings cause the oil scraper looks pretty
worn (last compression was a bit uneven too, but all above 110)... the
cylinders still have cross-hatching marks in them... so here's my questions:

how difficult is it to hone cylinders by myself? i know i can rent a honer
bit cheap... also, the cylinders are pretty rusty looking, and i was
wondering if i should paint them (i'll be repainting the tin and case and
fan housing... nothing like that clean newly painted look to an engine
you're putting back in)...

anyone have any advice?

thanks!
