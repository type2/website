Subject: Re: [T2] mystery 3000

It sounds like  something is overheating and then kicking out.  The 
only  item items i can think of  at the moment are the coil and the 
diodes in  the double relay.

&gt; ok, I need help! I've got an 81' cal. model westy. it seems to 
&gt; run       with no fuel pressure!
&gt; #1) 3 of the 4 injectors can be unplugged and it still runs
&gt; #2) it runs better on 2 than four
&gt; #3) will run with AFM unplugged, fuel pump shuts off, no pressure in 
&gt; lines for 30-40 minutes
&gt; #4) unplug vac. booster and it revs to 3000 and stays
&gt; #5) bypass cold start-runs 10-15 min.
&gt; #6) checks valves are good
&gt; #7) fuel will still run thru it, pressure test is good
&gt; all of the usual has been tested or replaced and tested again!(AFM, 
&gt; double relay, O2 sensor, cyl temp sensor, etc. per Bently . even swaped 
&gt; ecu's w/no effect!
&gt; original prob. was that it would start and run for approx. 10 min. then 
&gt; die. pumping gas pedal had no effect
&gt; is there a &quot;zen mechanic&quot; out there that might fathom this situation as 
&gt; the analytical approach does not seem to be working for me OR my 
&gt; usually very competent support group?
&gt; p.s. email answers/suggestions/prayers to me direct
&gt;          thanks in adv.,  a. hoffmann
&gt;                                       smithfield, ut.
