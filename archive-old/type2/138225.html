Subject: Snap-on is crazy

The saga continues. A few weeks ago I ordered a micrometer standard -- 
a very accurately trimmed 3&quot; piece of 1/4&quot; steel rod -- to check the 
accuracy of my $19.95 caliper. Instead of sending me the standard, 
Snap-on sent me a tube of ratchet grease.

After some time on the phone, it was agreed that Snap-on would cancel 
the order, and I would return the ratchet grease. This was because they 
did not, in fact, have the standard in stock.

I ordered a standard from another on-line source and received a 
Starrett standard a few days ago. I haven't yet returned the grease 
because Snap-on sent me a misaddressed label for doing the return.

And now the latest: today, UPS dropped off a 3&quot; Snap-on micrometer 
($228). No purchase order, no shipping label. No sign that my credit 
card has been dunned.

I spent a minute or two trying to convince myself that this was a 
goodwill gesture. But, no, it's a screw-up. Much as I would like to 
keep the micrometer, I'm not a $228 micrometer kind of mechanic. So 
it's got to go back. Maybe they'll send me a TiG welder next time? Then 
I would feel truly tempted toward dishonesty.

I guess this is the reason that most people buy Chevy's and get their 
work done by the dealer.

I sure wish that Ron and Scott and other folks would get into selling 
the tools that you can't get at Sears.
