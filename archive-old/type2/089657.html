Subject: Re: [T2] air scoops - which kind ?

are you trying to put the 72 and up air scoops on your 71 , VW put these 
bigger ones on when they went to the type 4 motor, it does cool better,,,,,,

now if you are talking about putting the early model aftermarket ones down on 
the quarter panel, well thats a different question,

I would not know how the factory air scoops up on top would interact with the 
aftermarket ones on the quarter panel....you would have 2 sets of scoops 
then.......
