Subject: Vendor correction

&gt;From my vendor comparison post last week, 
I've had a few inquiries about contacting 
&quot;Vintage VW&quot;, cited as one of three suppliers of parts
for my engine rebuild, and one with knowledgable staff.

Whoopsie! It was Vintage Parts, that I was writing 
about, not Vintage VW. Sorry for any confusion..
