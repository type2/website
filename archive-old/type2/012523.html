Subject:  [T2] Re: Campgrounds and Type2 types

&gt;Maybe we need to be aware of the possibility that we are &quot;marked&quot; by some
&gt;business people who come in contact with all the various kinds who are part
&gt;of our clan, and so we get stereotyped unfairly.

We have neighbors who run a KOA Kampground, and they tell me that they
cringe whenever a VW Bus comes in.  Most of their experience with busses
has been college kids who make noise, party, litter, and often fail to pay.
Most of their customers are retirees on vacation, and they don't like this
a bit.

It may be an unfair stereotype, but I also feel bad that the campground
owners often have to put up with that nonsense.
