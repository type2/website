Subject: I need a manual

I just bought a 75 camper I guess, and I now nothing about him. I need a manual.
Usually for me (I am living in Romania), it is a real adventure to buy from out side my country. But, right now I have an opportunity; (a friend of mine is in Chicago). All I have to do is to give him what and from where to buy. That is what I need: some information on my bus to be sure I pick the right manual (the numbers are 2352092835 and engine B 551835), and the place to buy the manual from Chicago (a web site would be OK). 
Please do not jump on me if I have broken any rules, but I need that information fast. Anyway faster then I can find it my self.


Andrei
