My first bus, 1978 Westy &quot;Moseby,&quot; was definitely a E or below bus.  The 
interior was a deluxe and complete in every ay...it was too bad the body 
was like swiss cheese.  &quot;Moseby&quot; and I seperated a year ago...I sent him to 
a nice family with a farm...

My second bus, 1975 Westy &quot;meine Rettung&quot; (my salvation/rescue, for those 
of you still wondering), has a 'C' body...meaning rust around window seals, 
mainly due to the fact that some %sshole painted it without removing seals 
and such...or sanding and priming first!  So, in a year, he will have a new 
base and top coat, along with a full undercoating.  His camper interior is 
an 'B+', but not complete.  The interior will be an 'A' by the time I roll 
out for my 6 month roadtrip.  I figured the $2000+ I would spend on a good 
paint job, would allow me to travel for longer...the paint can wait...with 
a little temporary fixes here and there.

&quot;Meine Rettung&quot; is quite a change from my previous T2, since I can DRIVE 
this one (interesting concept, eh?!)

Quite frankly, I wouldn't want it to ever be perfect...because, what would 
I do in my spare time then?!
