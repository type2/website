Subject: Emily - reintroduction

Hi all.

I was active on this list in 1996-1998.  I am trying to not be chatty to
comply with list charter but I would love to hear from any of you who
remember me.  I figured a Friday was safe to post an intro...  Please email
me privately if you remember me.  My last name used to be Hanlon - I helped
create the type2_dot_com site way back when and there is still a credit to me on
the credits page which is kind of amazing!

I have a 1978 Champagne Edition Transporter, which I had repainted and
reupholstered and customized/modified in 1994-1997, mainly in Tampa,
Florida.  I was in college in Wisconsin after that and am now in
northeastern Minnesota (there was a man on this list who was moving near
here to work for the library system - are you still here?).  Here is the web
page I had in college (with additions from 2002 I think):

I bought a Chevy Venture minivan in 1998 and that was the beginning of the
end.  Now I am married and have a kid, 2 dogs, 3 cats and two home-based
businesses.  The bus hasn't been started since late summer of 2003.  Oh it
makes me sad just thinking about it. I am torn between inspiring myself to
take better care of it or selling it to someone who will love it as much as
it deserves to be loved.  One winter I rented a garage for it, but that
isn't available anymore.  We don't have a garage -- if we did it would be
pretty easy to park her in there and feel OK. But it's just not right to let
a Type 2 sit in five feet of snow for five months.

Well, I'll be hanging around reading messages for a while until I decide
what to do.  If anyone knows Daniel Morris I would love to get in touch with
him.
