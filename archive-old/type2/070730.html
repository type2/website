Subject: will the real  Westfalia SO69 please stand up

Below are two links

Link #1 is from the type2_dot_com library and is of a &quot;SO69 &quot; model 
Westfalia camper circa 1968 to 1971.
The pic is what seems to be referred to in Europe as the the Helsinki 
model. I have only seen one of these around the South Eastern US. and 
it is a 1969 model year bus. and a walkthru.

The next link is to pics of a 1968 Westfalia with Dormobile top. The 
interior is clearly the bay window version of the splitscreen(1964 to 
1967) SO44 interior which is often referred to as an SO69. I have 
seen two of these Dor top Westies and they were both 1970 models.

Both interiors are correct Westfalia interiors although neither of 
these interiors were offered in the US. Most seem to have come from 
Canada or were brought over by US servicemen after tours of duty in 
Europe.

You can see examples of both buses at this years EveryBus 2001!

Both interiors are correct Westfalia interiors.
