Subject: Help needed - Alternator replacement, '80 Vanagon

Volks,

On my way back from the beach last night, the alt light came on and
stayed on.  Now the Alternator has been a under-performer on this beast
for a while, so after some minimal checks, I am replacing the alt.  First,
I want to say  that compared to replacement on the bay, this is an
absolute DREAM!  Second, tho, I have reached a sticking point.  I have the
alternator out and the fan housing off the front, but the fan is still
mounted to the pulley.

For those of you with bays, the hot air fan of the bay moves from on top
of the engine compartment to the end of the alternator pulley in a
Vanagon.  Cool in a way, a PITA in another.

Is there a peaceful way of holding the alternator from turning to crank
the 3/4&quot; nut off the end of the shaft?  anyone???

                           Steve Dolan
