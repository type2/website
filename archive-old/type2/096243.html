&gt; &gt; Jennifer............. Take some advise from an old guy that has seen a
&gt; &gt; lot. Don't paint your van a metallic color and don't use clear coat on
&gt; &gt; your new paint job. Both are bad ideas.
&gt; &gt; The metallics fade crack, the clear coats turn yellow and craze,
&gt; &gt; sometimes coming off in sheets.
&gt; 
&gt; And old vws just dont look right in metallics or clear coated.

well this friend just loves the look of their bright white over metalic
blue 78.....ok so no clear coat
