Subject: Can I beadblast my valves to clean them?

I was thinking I'd glass bead my intakes to clean them up as part of a
general head port and polish. New exhaust valves of course. Anyone think
beadblasting is harmful to them? They'll get a 3 angle valve job afterwards
anyway. Also, anyone seen any of the original 8mm stellite exhaust valves
for sale lately? I'd prefer to use those to Stainless, I think they are
better (just my opinion, be glad to listen to discussions either way)
Thanks,
Courtney
