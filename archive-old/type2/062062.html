Subject: Marine Paint

Hi. A recent message on the vintagvw list discussed using marine paint to
paint a car, so yesterday I went to check it out. I'm not much of a boat
person, so I didn't quite know what to expect when my daughter and I went
to a marine store. We had a great time checking out all the ropes, fenders,
life preservers, etc. (and Sperry Top-Siders for $49!). Anyway, they have a
special polyurethane paint for painting the topside of a boat. It comes in
all sorts of colors, and is about $20/quart, or $55/gallon, although they
only had white in the gallon cans. The store guy told me that if you use
the right brush, thinner, and technique, you can get a finish that is
virtually brush mark-free. He also said that this paint is much mure
durable than acrylic paint, although the darker colors tend to oxidize in a
couple of years. However, he said that it could be waxed, which might fight
the oxidation. Does anyone have any experience with these types of paints?
Perhaps I'll go with Matterhorn grey on the top and Fire red on the
bottom... :).
Take it easy,
