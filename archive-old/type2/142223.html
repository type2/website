Subject: Re: [T2] Powder

Dave,

Thanks for the reminder about chasing the threads. And for &quot;testifying&quot; 
about your success with having your shroud powdercoated. Considering 
(1) how prominent the shroud is in the engine bay, and (2) how 
difficult it is to work with, I'm now convinced that powdercoating is 
hands down the way to go.

I've been thinking about making a metal fan guard and powder coating 
it, as well. Very light welding rod might work. I'd have to set up a 
buck, weave the wire, solder the intersections, make a ring and tabs, 
and send it off to be powder coated. Might be a big improvement on 
(ratty) plastic guard.

I'm going to try to take a picture with more accurate color today.

Mark
