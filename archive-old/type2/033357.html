Subject: Compu-fire dwell question

Greetings,

I recently installed a compu-fire electronic ignition kit in my 009 dizzy.  
Since I installed the kit, I get a dwell reading of about 75 on my dwell 
meter (and I get the same reading on a different dwell meter).  I would 
think this should me more in the range of 50-60.  I have not noticed any 
change in engine performance since I installed this unit, so perhaps it is 
not important...  Insights, comments, suggestions, musings, pointless 
ramblings???

thanks,

Brian
