Subject: Re: [T2] A &quot;NEW&quot; '68 Crewcab?

It looks to me that the front turn signals are in the wrong place.
They should be next to the bumper. In 1972 VW moved the turn signals
up next to the air intake.  However, I did once own a 1971 bus that
had the newer style front turn signals. That has always been a mystery 
to me. Anybody know the story on that? The rear tail lights on that bus
were correct for 1971.
