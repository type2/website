	Got the bus on the road today after getting it inspected this morning.
Put about 60 miles on it today.  It ran strong although barely made it past
50 in the strong wind in New Hampshire today.  I know when I hit 3rd gear
because my hand hits the emergency brake handle!

	Much thanks to Karl Von Salzen, Brent Jarvi for the used parts.  The new
heads from Boston Engine seem real strong and thanks to The Bus Depot for
the prompt and efficient service.

	It was a great feeling to drive the bus today knowing that I had done all
the work myself including the blue and white paint job!

	Finally, thanks again to the list and all of the resources.  I've decided
to drop my subscription to VW Trends and send the money to the list
instead.  This list is a much better resource than most of the VW mags out
there.  There's only so many custom and restored photo spreads you can take
before they pretty much all look the same !
