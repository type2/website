Subject: A plea concerning area codes and for-sale listings

Greetings, all:

New area codes are popping up all the time [Oregon now has a second one],
and I never had that many memorized in the first place.  And I'm probably
not alone.  As a favor [I'm watching FS's for a couple of friends around
the country, and I bet I'm not alone in this concern], could people flag
their posts and reposts of FS notices at least with the state or metro
area--in the subject line? 

Thanks
