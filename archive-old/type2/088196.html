The rust preventive coating called &quot;Corroless&quot; can be found a
www.eastwoodco_dot_com 

Also I have to agree with Terry, Have the actually painting done
professionally. I have painted a few cars and not have very good luck.
It's a very fine line between getting the paint thick enough and have
runs.

Most of the expense in a paint job is the prep. Also it's the quality of
the prep that has a lot to do with the longevity of the paint job. If
you want to control the quality of the paint job do the prep yourself.
You can pay as much attention to details as you want. And when it comes
to actually painting it don't scrimp on the quality of the paint. You be
living with the paint job for many years.
