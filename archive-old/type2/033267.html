Jan and Listees,

I have a picture somewhere of a splitty (or maybe a model of a splitty?) 
in a wind tunnel... the nose and sides have tufts of yarn attached so that
the airflow patterns can be observed.  Crude but effective -- we do the
exact same thing on airplanes and cars today. VW tested several different
variations of splitty front end; one was pretty square, another very
rounded but without angled windows, and one was close to the version that
we see on the road.

I haven't wind-tunnel-tested my '72 bus yet, but I did do some experiments
with my BMW motorcycle when I was in school!

I don't know if I buy the argument that &quot;round curves make it look fast&quot;
;-)
