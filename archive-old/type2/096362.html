really thought of that too, and doing that when I swap my tranny, BUT the
problem is the &quot;ears&quot; on the top of the tranny that fit up into the
hanger.  that means the front (flywheel end) of the engine has to drop
down a few inches before the tranny can be slide forward to clear the
lower studs this also leaves the front end of the engine unsupported at
all (would use a chain fall sling) 
 then there is the slector lever and accel linkage to the tranny I think I
would prefer not having to futz with any more than I have to.

to slide engine back I could leave the tranny in the hanger and only have
to remove the accel linkage and the air cleaner to pull it back, maybe the
oil fill and of course the rear tin.

engine is heavy but removing the tranny from the hanger means holding the
weight of both up, disconected.  (I remove the engine and tranny
seperately all the time anyway)
