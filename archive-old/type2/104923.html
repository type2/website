Subject: Re: [T2] Thoughts on changing tops-Angled to a horizontal?

&gt;Can you be more specific about the roof on the 74?  I used a 74 westfalia roof to create my Westfakia, Yip, His must be a Riviera conversion.  (234XXX XXXX vin).  Any way, the only difference I can see is in the opening.  Mine is about 4&quot; smaller on the front side.  Same size as the original sunroof opening and the riviera opening goes forward more towards the B pillars.On may way home today, I saw another '72 that had a riviera style top on it.  I could not find the owner of the bus, so I was not able to ask any Q's.Paul.
