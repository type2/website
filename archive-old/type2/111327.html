http://www.mindspring_dot_com/~contecmidwest/ Here I sit
the only things left to do is to add food and sleeping
gear into the Westy. The hard part is I can't leave
till about 3:00 Friday. I've checked the oil three
times, it's still full to the mark, auto-transmixer
full, tire pressure checked good, W/W fluid full,
brakes checked, leveling jacks on board for the steep
camp site, now for the hardest part, waiting till
Friday. hope to see a lot of you good people at the
Festival. Phil
