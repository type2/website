Subject: Re: [T2] Front table

Bill,
I was missing one of the two on my 78 when I bought it, so I replaced
both with stainless strap anchors from west marine. They look sharp and
of course will never break. I think I still have the one I pulled. You
may have it if you like. I can't help with the picture.

&gt;     I just got a table for the front of my 78 Westy(thanks Mike). I
&gt; don't have the brackets that hook
&gt; to the dash or even know what they look like. If someone has an extra
&gt; set let me know. I also would
&gt; like to see a picture of what they look like installed if possible. I
&gt; also wanted to thank everyone for
&gt; there reply to my sender inquiry earlier this week.
