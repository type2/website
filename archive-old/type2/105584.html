Subject: Re: [T2] rough idle when cold

---Matthew wrote:
&gt; When I first crank over the FI 2.0L engine in my 78
&gt; westy, It idles and runs rough for the first five
&gt; minutes or less. What could this be? I would not even
&gt; know where to begin looking in the archives, so I put
&gt; this question to you, fair type 2 community. I read
&gt; Bartnik's explanation of how the cold start valve
&gt; works, so I don't think that is the problem.

---Bob replied:
&gt; check your temp sensor #2 on the head near #3 cyl

Check the temp sensor like Bob suggests. The one on my 79 bus was slightly
loose one time, and it drove me nuts until I went to change it out and noticed
it was loose.
