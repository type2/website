Subject: Re: Place for out-of-print owners manuals

Well, I met a few guys at the NAA car show last august who specialize in 
owners manuals and advertizements, I found nothing I wanted, but they did 
have a lot of manuels and sales brochures, In VWs a few still with the 
plastic folder, I'll keep an eye out for the business card and post the 
address if I find it.
