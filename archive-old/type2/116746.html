Subject: lock door handle question?

Can I take that cylinder out of my old door handle if its busted, and insert 
it into my new one, so my regular keys fits?

I was trying to figure out why the pass handle didnt open the door, and the 
handle itself is broken. I was able to take this screw out, and this little 
cylinder comes out of it, which seems to be setup perfectly for this key. If 
possible, I would like to keep the same key for all doors.
