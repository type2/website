personally looking at em, they look exactly the same in different
packaging,  although I think the enema ones are cheaper even with the
enema. but don't tell the cook.   

I am using the synthetic lubes in my final drive. I have an automatic so
it takes a lot less 90W but it makes up for it in Dextron.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Can someone tell me where the gear oil fill opening is on a 71 
&gt; &gt; transmission, and how do I get the oil in there (I assume it's on 
&gt; &gt; top of the transmission). After exensive archive research I found 
&gt; &gt; that I should use GL-4 90 weight oil, but not the specifics of 
&gt; &gt; changing it.  I also had no luck finding this info in my Bentley.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; it is on the side of the tranny, uses a really big allen wrench to 
&gt; &gt; remove.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; oil goes in until it just reaches the fill hole
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I use a enema syringe to put the oil in.  cheap at the local drug 
&gt; &gt; store,
&gt; &gt; and you get the enema as a bonus, of course a used one works just as 
&gt; &gt; well
&gt; &gt; when cleaned ;8*?
