Subject: re: PCH road trip (LA to Crescent City)

On 4/10/02, nikkies_at_charter_dot_net thus spake:

&gt;Myself being a former resident of Crescent City, and noting that
&gt;you've never
&gt;been that far north on Hwy 101, I sincerely hope your Bus doesn't

    Whoa there... That's not me talking, I just forwarded the message I
got from Littljessica_at_aol_dot_com. Drop a line directly to her or call 'em on
the cell phone, I have no connection other than being a random address
harvested from AIRS... From the context of the message it's unclear if
they'll be doing email en route, so a phone call may be in order.

(btw- I did do PCH, back in '96 on the way to Inuvik. Incredible road
trip. Highly recommended for those needing a get away. Although for the
LA-SF route we detoured up the San Joaquin valley to Kings Canyon NP,
also highly recommended) 

Peace,
