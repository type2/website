&gt;This sounds to me like something is screwed up with the valve train
&gt;geometry.   If things are set up correctly you should be able to turn in the
&gt;adjuster screw 1-1/2 to 2 turns without any problems.  The issue addressed
&gt;by the .006&quot; clearance advise, as I understand it, is to allow air-bound
&gt;lifters to pump up.  After they are pumped up you then adjust them to their
&gt;&quot;normal&quot; setting, whatever your particular religion tells you is &quot;normal.&quot;
&gt;
&gt;I'd ask the tech who wrote that note what he/she means here.  It seems
&gt;there's 2 possibilities.  On the one hand the situation might be that, even
&gt;with the adjusting screw completely backed out the rocker arm is still in
&gt;contact with the valve stem, suggesting lots of preload, and 1/8th of a turn
&gt;later the hydraulic lifter has bottomed out.  Or, the adjusting screw could
&gt;be so far away from the valve stem that by the time you turn the screw in
&gt;far enough to contact the stem you've only got about 1/8th turn left before
&gt;the screw is in danger of disappearing.  I'd say either situation is
&gt;abnormal and warrants a closer look.

Could it be a problem of cam not being correctly aligned with the
crank?

&gt;
&gt;Since this is an AVP engine determine what the tech is saying and then call
&gt;Leonard and discuss it with him.  He can be difficult to get a hold of -
&gt;you'll probably reach his wife first - and talk through the possibilities.

My emails have not been answered. I'll call them on Monday. Is
Leonard's wife called Erin? She was the one who delivered the engine.

Thanks to all for the responses. This problem kept me awake last night
:-)
