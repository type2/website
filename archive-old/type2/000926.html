&gt; You have the chance of a lifetime! Please, don't waste it. Bundle up the
&gt; kids and the SO and put them in your bus and head out. Use your bus every
&gt; chance you get, and steal a chance or too to boot.
&gt;
&gt; In no time at all, the kids will be six-foot-two.

My 11 year old son visited for the first time, last summer.  I rushed to
finish installing the new engine in my 79 Westy, just two days before he
arrived.  We spent two wonderful weeks getting to know each other... what
better way, then traveling in a VW!

He is flying here (Virginia) from Utah on Tuesday for 2 weeks, and... you
guessed it - the bus is ready to go!

The fondest memories I have of my own childhood are vacationing in &quot;betsy
the bus&quot;, my fathers red, '69 westy!
