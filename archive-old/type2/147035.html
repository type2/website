Subject: The eagle has landed 

If you recall folks I bought the '71 westy off Victor Cardoni in late 
August.  Steve Dolan helped out with the shipping stateside and got the 
bus to port - thanks man. 

It set off on it's merry way a couple of weeks ago and arrived at 
Liverpool on Monday night.  Customs gave clearance and I got the phone 
call to say &quot;come and get it&quot;

We drove over to port today (about 30 miles) away and after the 
paperwork was done it was fantastic to see the very same bus sat in a 
holding car park waiting for me.  It fired up and after a minor repair 
to the gear shifter (it had popped out of the cup on the end of the long 
rod) we were on our way back home.  Some slightly bald front tires made 
the journey home a little hairy - good job it wasn't raining! and by 3pm 
it was on my driveway safe and sound - hurrah.

It's been a learning curve, but I'm really glad I did this.  The bus is 
pretty good for an east coast bus.  The body is about the same condition 
as a west coast bus - just a few bits of welding here and there.  Plenty 
of things to fix too - great. I'll be getting a list together.

The main thing is that I could not have done this without the list and 
the kind help of listees - thanks guys, the bus has most certainly 
arrived at a good home and will be very well looked after and enjoyed.

Happy man

Lee
