Subject: Re: [T2] Dumb Clutch Question.

WASTE in N.J characteristically quipped: 

&gt;  Hey, this is a family oriented list...don't be such a zerk... ;-)
&gt;
	This was in response to my jotting to Dan
&gt;
&gt;&gt;  Come on, Dan, be a devil  -  emulate us Brit Commonwealth
&gt;  &gt; hooligans, use the term 'grease nipple'.

	Waste has also speculated on how to invent the grease nipple 
for a Bowden cable.
	It makes me feel old to have to point out that such modules 
were widespread on UK motorcycles for a few decades.  Piano wires out 
in the weather, running over pulleys, were one blunder by the USA 
motorcycle industry (which by mid-C20 had largely succumbed to crazy 
gigantism and hasn't recovered); on this design issue, the Poms did 
far better  -  Bowden cables.
	But they do need lubrication.  As with typical push-bikes, 
oil was largely preferred (slid down the inner in a few min of 
maintenance, say every 5,000 mi), and I'm glad to do that to my 
sickles of that period &amp; newer.  If VW joined the sickle industry in 
implying that a grease nipple wasn't needed on a Bowden cable by 
mid-C20, I can only regret that lazy if not sleazy decadence.
	A grease nipple part way along a Bowden cable should be a 
routine module.  To omit it, saving perhaps $1, is the kind of 
depraved cheapskate design forced upon European mfrs by the poverty 
of WW2.
	It may be argued that grease won't tend to run out of the T2 
clutch cable because it's practically horizontal.
		(1)  not quite true at ends
		(2)  are there proper 'telescoping' rubber 
dirt-excluders at the ends?

	Perhaps recent Mexican or Brazilian T2 have grease nipples to 
lubricate important cables?  I doubt it.  But there's nothing 
stopping them from re-starting those factories and making the best 
wagon yet  ...
	Now there's a decent &amp; family message   :-)
