&gt; as many of you have found out (the hard way), the Type 4 engine
&gt; thermostats are impossible to get (the company making them stopped). Well,
it
&gt; turns out that you can use type 1 thermostats with a little work (not
much; any 6th
&gt; grader can do it).


I can confirm that. In fact Just Kampers in the UK have been doing this for
some time now and it works just fine. It is a simple swap, and the
temperature range difference is minimal. (It will make the engine run just
slightly cooler.)
