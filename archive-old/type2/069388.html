Subject: Cold weather FI starting question

This is my first Montana winter driving my '78 bus.  When 
starting the engine in cold weather...5-20 degrees F., it takes 
at least three attempts to get it to fire.  It seems necessary to 
&quot;pump the gas&quot; during these attempts.  This doesn't seem right 
when compared to starting my (wife's) Honda.  Any tricks, advice, 
cures??  Danke schoen!
Ralph
