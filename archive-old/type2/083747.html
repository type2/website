&gt; Here is a brief rundown of my trouble. a longer more detailed description

&gt;
&gt; My bus wouldn't start when I turned the key. The starter wouldn't turn over,
&gt; no clicking only one faint click. After pulling it out and bench testing it
&gt; (checked ok), I put it back in and it worked fine. What could be the
&gt; problem?

Jim,

This is the classic &quot;hot start problem&quot;  over the 20+ years since
manufacture, bits of corrosion have built up in every connection, reducing
the voltage bit by bit until not enough is passing to &quot;kick&quot; the solenoid.
You  can go thru the whole starting circuit and clean every connection and
that will certainly help, but it takes a lot of time.  You can replace the
starter, and that will help (for a while) as new/rebuilt starters draw
less energy (for a while), btut that isn't cheap on a late model bus.  Or
you can do what many of us have done.... You can install a Bosch WR1
starter relay kit.  This will reduce the required voltage and let you use
your old starter for a whole lot longer (saves money) without cleaning all
the fiddly connections (and saves time :-).

Most if not all the list vendors carry this handy item and it is less than
$10 from any of them.  A quick search of Ron's site (www.busdepot_dot_com)
turned up:

He's selling it for $7.95, about the normal price.  You might find it at a
FLAPS that handles Bosch parts as well.
