&gt;So...since so many of us have web-sites that are
&gt;type-II related....why not specialize? Why not link to
&gt;one-another? Why not &quot;organize&quot; our skills/knowledge
&gt;to make this data-base (also known as the type II
&gt;list) a FAR more powerful tool?

&gt;I could go on and on. There is *infinite* info on this
&gt;list: it comes from the members! Why not make a
&gt;web&lt;site&gt;-ring that deals with that?

&gt;Lots of us have web-sites devoted to busses...

Hi Jaime and all you Type2 people

Your idea is quite interesting. Kind of a Type2 Internet...

Well, matter of fact, just put my own page on the WEB. So one pace at a
time, will put some pictures of the restoration of my 72 West and other
subjects of interest for me and maybe others too.

Address is: http://members.xoom_dot_com/DaMorning/index.html

So everybody's welcome to visit and to give me advice on the restoration.
