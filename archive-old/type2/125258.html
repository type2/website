Subject: Re: [T2] Let me introduce myself... :-)

 Bernd,
Welcome to the bus community,  Nice bus..  I noticed something different on
your bus than a bus that was imported to the US.  It has a metal (red) dash.
All of our dashes were padded after 68.

It doesn't look like you'll have to much to do on this restore.

Good Luck,
Snoopy
