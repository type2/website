Richard,

Typical &quot;at the port&quot; installation of air-conditioning.

The guys at the port got paid by the vehicle and were often under pressure 
to get it done so that it could get on a truck and get to the dealer to be 
delivered.

I don't think that *any* installer ever did it according to the specs in 
the installation sheet.  Mine had about 3/4&quot; of opening around almost all 
of it....just wonderfull to suck hot muffler aair right back over the 
engine.

This is one fo the reasons that I did all the extra work to install the 
rotary compressor in mine *and* have all of the original tin intact!

Cheers, dave

&gt; The bus was stock and otherwise normal looking but I was horrified at the
&gt; poor engine seal where the air compressor was installed.
&gt; 
&gt; The original engine only had 49k original miles on it and now needs a
&gt; rebuild.
