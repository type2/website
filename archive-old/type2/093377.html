&gt;Greetings Esteemed List,
&gt;
&gt;         I found a cheap gasoline rated (with Viton seals) manual fuel
&gt;shutoff valve listed in McMaster Carr's online catalog.  If you go to
&gt;http://www.mcmaster_dot_com and search for &quot;fuel shutoff valve&quot; you will get
&gt;directly to the page.  My first guess at the best part # to order is
&gt;7910K82.
=========================&gt;
First thought on my end........
Use the standard design with 360 degree rotation, and equipped with flare 
connections.
7910K35 or 38
Wonder what the proper metric size should be? Will have to Bentley look.

I would install it immediately at the fuel line to tank interface, coming 
immediately off of the tank nipple.
If it leaks, ever, it will be to ground, and not to a hot surface.

What do others say??

I think I will install a valve, but am gonna have to think about it a bit 
before I commit to a plan.
