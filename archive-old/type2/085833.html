Subject: Electronic ignition opposed to points &amp; condenser

Hey everybody,

The dude at the parts shop I go to tried to sell me an electronic ignition 
replacement module instead of putting in new points and condenser. He says 
he runs one in his bus, and rarely has trouble with it. Does anybody have 
any info or experience with these devices?

Thanks!
