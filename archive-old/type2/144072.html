The biggest problem is the heat exchangers they wont allow the fan to come 
out far enough past the studs with out bending the heck out of them (hack 
job).

**You CAN make a cut and strategically bend the rearmost lip of the boxes and do a decent job of putting them back together as long as you have the stock covers, gaskets, etc.


Joe sez:  I have never done this. I pull the engine. 

**Much better option and chance to take care of other issues that WILL be there.  At least strip everything down to the longblock and go from there.

****One more shortcut I've done is to remove the four studs and pull the housing straight up and out.  You may scar the studs getting them out so be prepared to get new ones before you reinstall.
