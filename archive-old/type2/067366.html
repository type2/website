Subject: Brand New Eberspacher

Well, I'm jealous now.

My brother came back from Germany with a brand-spankin' new 
B3-LC Eberspacher gas heater.  (for his bug 'vert, he's driving it
year 'round in Newfoundland)

I don't have the specs handy, but let me just say, its a thing of
beauty.  Its got a hard plastic case, and it has aluminum fins in
it just like the old heater boxes.  The unit is square, shorter 
than a BN2, but a bit bigger around.  Gorgeous.  Apparently it runs
completely soundless.  We'll see about that one.

It measures the temp of incoming air (in a recirc setup), compares it
against the dial in the dash, to figger out what heat setting to 
run the heater at.  My brother opted out of the digital control
(150dm more)

Now the heart stopper:  1500$CDN, bout a grand US.  Ouch.
