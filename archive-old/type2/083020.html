Subject: cyl. head temp gauge question

hello,

picked up a cylinder head temp gauge at the bus depot
this friday. installed it yesterday with no real
problems. however i have a few questions. 

-where did everyone else connect there hot(red) wire
to, in order to make the light in the gauge work.
right now mine in just jammed in with a fuse, as i
couldnt find the correct wire to connect it to.

-how hot should my cylinder head be? (at cyl 3)


i also plan get  oil temp and oil pressure gauges. so
that i dont have to bother the list again at that
time, what are the correct readings for those gauges?

ok, that'll do it. as always thanks in advance for all
answers insights and opinions!!
