&gt; Definately should take out the pilot bearing from what

&gt;  You should be able to rent for free a bearing puller
&gt; from any of the major auto parts stores, some loan
&gt; them out and some charge a little bit.  Either way, it
&gt; makes the job a lot easier.

OTOH, I never take them out unless there is a reason to do so.  Remember
that this bearing does not turn unless the clutch is disengaged.  IF the
vehicle is highway driven, the bearing gets very little wear.  In the city
it gets more, particularly if the driver rides the clutch at stoplights.

I've only had one of these go bad on me in thirtymumble years of driving.
