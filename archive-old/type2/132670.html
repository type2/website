Subject: Re: [T2] Tire shop apes broke my bus (long)

Oh, yeah, and one more thing. There's a phrase that some retail and 
service people use that you should listen for. If you ask for a tire 
size or for a part for your bus, and the guy says he doesn't have it 
but can order it, but it's &quot;not too popular,&quot; turn on your heals and 
leave the premises at once. Run for your life. I don't know how this 
phrase crept into business usage, but I sure hear it a lot (being a bus 
owner and having related tastes) out there in the retail world. I don't 
give a &amp;$*#^ what's popular. To me, popular equals stupid and mindless. 
SUVs are popular. On the other hand, I too was not too popular in 
junior high. So when somebody uses that phrase, they insult me, my 
tastes, my bus, and --by the way -- the Platonic ideals.
