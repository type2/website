&gt; I gotta disagree with this.  The cam and valves are NOT different for FI vs
&gt; carb-ed engines (were talking type IV VW motors here).  The cam is different
&gt; for engines with hydraulic valves.  Valve sizes differ for the 1700, 1800,
&gt; and 2000 engines.

     My understanding was that all FI cams were different as well. Be
that as it may, the hydraulic cam definitely has different valve timing
and lift, and FI engines were made for more years with hydraulic than
solid, so at least those are different. And most certainly engineered by
the VW elves in their infinite wisdom to work best with FI.
