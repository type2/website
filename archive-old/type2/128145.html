Subject: lowering a bus.. thanks for all the info

Well thanks to all that responded to my question on lowering buses!
All but one were informative and positive... and even that &quot;one&quot;
wasnt bad... just questioning the validity of lowering a bus.. to that
question I have no answer... good bad or indifferent. this is just
an idea I am kicking around thinking that lowering the bus will help
some
on the highway handling... which is where I drive it the most.
When camping I tend not to do the 4 wheeling thing anymore.. to hard
on the old bus. :-)

Thanks again, Dan
