I openly concede that it could be completely true about the factory option.
My cursory understanding could be that the inclusion of the corner windows
as a factory Standard item ceased to be true after the '63 model year.
Charles Barkley keeps saying that he's no role model. I keep claiming that I
am no &quot;guru&quot; know-it-all.
