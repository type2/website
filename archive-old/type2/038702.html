Subject: inside door handle:)

listees,
i am in need of the inside drivers door handle on my
73 bus.  my original handle snapped off, and i
currently have a handle mechanism off a later model
bus that works, but i cannot use my door lock with
this.   so i was wondering if anyone has an inside
door handle for a 73 bus, drivers side.   it would be
really cool to lock my dolors again:)   please pmail
if you do with a price, mailing amount, all that fun
stuff.
