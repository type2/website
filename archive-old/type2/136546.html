Subject: Reminder of Utah t4/t2 engine for sale

I've noticed lately of people looking for rebuilt
engines.

Some time a go I rebuilt an engine for a 83 vanagon. 
Since then I've bought two waterboxers and don't need
the the 83.

Engine rebuilt from top to bottom new or re machined. 
New heads, shaft, cam, lifters, barrels, oil pump,
etc.

$1200 for long block with out skin and heater boxes

$1500 for long block with skin and heater boxes--turn
key

I have more in parts than I'm charging for this engine

Less than 50 miles on engine



Also Rancho rebuilt tranny...$500

If interested give me a call
