Subject: pop-top transplant?

Is it possible to &quot;graft&quot; an ASI &quot;straight-up&quot; or full bed westy &quot;slanted&quot;
pop-top on to an older (71/72) campmobile? If so, what are the expenses and
work involved? I would appreciate hearing from anyone that has
tried/completed this task -- actually I would appreciate hearing from anyone
&lt;G&gt;

Jamie
