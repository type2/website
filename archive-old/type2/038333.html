Subject: Exhaust Silver Solder?

I am in the process of attempting to return my 82 FI Vanagon exhaust to its 
original appearance.  In a previous message problems with the MD state 
inspection were mentioned &amp; a need for parts. Luckily I was able to retrieve 
the crossover pipe &amp; catalytic converter form the previous owner!  
Unfortunately the elbow for the EGR valve had been cut &amp; welded closed by 
the first owner in the history of this VW.

So now to complete the EGR setup I need to make a connection from the nub 
left on the crossover pipe to the flange on the underside of the tin where 
the EGR filter used to be.  I do not have access to any type of welder, only 
propane &amp; solder.  A friend mentioned the possibility &amp; affordability of 
Silver Solder.  Could this be used to bind copper to steel?

Ideally I would like to have a copper coupler permanently attached to the 
crossover pipe &amp; the flange that is the remnants of the EGR filter from long 
ago, so I can use my torch to solder a copper tube to bridge the gap.

Any advice would be appreciated. - th
