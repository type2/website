Subject: Re: [T2] CV joint troubles and history lesson.

It has three tabs with two holes, and some thin serrated washers.  Leave
out either and you'll probably get some metal-to-metal.

&gt; I can't remember, what does the bus CV have under the CV bolts; 1 washer per
&gt; bolt or the special &quot;double-bolt washer&quot;?  Either way, if you don't have the
&gt; proper washer under the bolt (especially on the outer CV), the bolt is too long
&gt; and will hit something.
&gt;
&gt; Sorry about the vague description, but it's the best I can do without crawling
&gt; under there and looking.
