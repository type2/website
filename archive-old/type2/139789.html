&gt; &gt; Im sure many of you have done some cross-country trips in your busses.  Any
&gt; &gt; route suggestions (Mass to Cali)?  And how long did your trip take?  Is 15
&gt; &gt; days too little time?  THANKS!
&gt;
&gt; Well, if I had to do it, I'd follow US50.  This is the most intact US
&gt; route left.  I've never done the whole thing, but someday...

the part thru WVa is steep and has lots of large coal trucks on it, I've
driven it in my bus and some grades are 20mph specials...it also has some
pretty tight turns too.   check brakes and make sure engine is in top
shape,

and if you are inclined &quot;Timberline&quot; ski slope just off the road is worth
the side trip
