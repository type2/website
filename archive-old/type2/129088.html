Subject: Shall I post my stupidity for all to see?

Today as I was parking the bus to go have lunch, I forgot to turn the 
engine off before I let my foot off the clutch.  I had my foot on the 
brake pretty hard, well.... sheared off one set of CV bolts completely.  
So that's good times.  I'm sure I'll be spending some quality time with 
some easy-outs and a drill in the parking lot in the record high SoCal 
heat. 

Just for extra fun, the AAA tow truck guy dropped my van off the hook 
halfway home.  Yeah, it was pretty cool.  Luckily it happened while he 
stopped for a red light, so we just cleared the intersection and spent a 
good amount of time trying to pry his and my vehicles apart.  Needless 
to say, from now on if my bus needs to be towed, I'm requesting a 
flatbed.  If they drop it from the flatbed, they'll have to buy me a new 
one :-) ...

Anyway, wish me luck and bloody knuckles as all my free time this week 
will be spent cursing at stuck bolts.  I did get a high top though, and 
it looks fantastic ratchet strapped over the pop-top.  Thanks Paul... 
That'll be the very next project, right after I make the van roll again.
