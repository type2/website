Subject: wiring gauges

situation: voltmeter, oil pressure, and oil temp gauges to be wired
question:  i need a ground for both the light and the power of the gauge, 
equaling 6 ground wires.  i also need a power ground for each (3 more wires.)

1) where can i get the power lead from to power the gauge?  this needs to 
be fused.._dot_can i use an in-line fuse?  if so, what kind of fuse?

2) in the dash, all of my dashlights (powered with the headlights) are in a 
series (jumping from one to the next.)  can i continue this series and jump 
from the last spot on the dash to my 3 gauges?

thanks...
missed you guys this last week.  my bus is still incomplete...the trip is 
pushed off by a week now.  the better half is on business his last week of 
work and everything left is a 2 person job.
