Subject: starter wont come out

Hey list I tried to help a friend yesterday buy a 77 automatic bus. It
needs a new starter and the owner had one,which we agreed to replace so we
could see if the van runs or not. So here we are 2 somewhat knowledgeable
VW enthusists trying for 3 hours to get the old starter out. Got the bottom
bolt out no problem but the top bolt has a small phlange surrounding the
bolt head so we could only get a small bit of the wrench around it. Tried
like crazy to yank that bolt out but no luck. We had to hang our heads in
shame and walk away. Its a 77 fuel injected engine not sure of the cc's.
Its the pop top that pops straight up, not a Westy. I think I've seen it
referred to as a Riveria? The lady is asking 600.00 and its in decent
shape,so any help on the nut would be app.
Buy the way i still have access to 2 jalouse windows complete with screens
if anyone is interested.
