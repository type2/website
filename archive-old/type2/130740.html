Subject: New BN2

I just got my hands on a compete (as far as I can tell) BN2 heater - so 
clean you can eat off of it.

All it seems to be missing is the glow plug.  I seem to recall someone 
offering some up from a bulk purchase that was made, but that was more 
than a year ago.

Anyone have a manual for this unit?

Experience?

Access Bob?
