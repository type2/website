Subject: Weird hole

BlankHi Volks,
There are two holes in the rear of my 73 bus one on either side of the
engine lid.  What are they for?  One is rusted
out on mine and I was gonna weld some donor metal in the space and was
wondering if I needed the hole or not.

Also just a reminder Edisto Freeze Yer Toe will be January 21-23 at Edisto
Beach State Park, South Carolina.
http://www.geocities_dot_com/Baja/Ravine/2474/EdistofreezeYertoe.html for more
info.  If you have never been to the beach in the winter you are missing a
real life experience.  So come on out and camp with the Full Moon Bus Club
