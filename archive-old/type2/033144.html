Subject: JBwelds*cks need oil filler tube

Hey now!  Well, I thought my troubles were over in my quest to fix my volcano 
like oil leak.  I used dome JB weld  to patch my exhisting tube.  I can't 
seem to find the tube anywhere round here.  Searche d for 5 hours yesterday 
at the local vw yard and found nothing:(  Anyone have a 80 oil filler tube?  
Or know of a good yard that might have one?  Please let me know  I'm blowing 
oil out of mine right now to the tune of  2 quarts a day!
