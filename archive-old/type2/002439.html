	While it is true the synthetic properties of Mobil 1 or any synthetic for
that matter do not break down like conventional oils and can go 5,10 and
even 25,000 miles per manufacturers claims, you need to take two things into
account.  One, the additive package in the oil does wear out and needs to
changed. To a certain degree this will be a prolonged period in a VW motor
because of you stated fact of consumption of 1 qt. every 1,000 miles.
Adding a fresh quart of new synth that often will delay the change to a
point.  However, the second thing to consider is the large percentage of
contaminents built up in a VW motor need to be removed.  This is a problem
since the vast majority of these motors do not have oil filters.  If yours
does have an oil filter, then changing the filter every 3,000 miles and
topping it off with fresh oil will prolong it to a certain degree.  This by
no means is the best answer since before then the filter will have probobly
been clogged enough to trip the bypass valve on it. meaning no filtration at
all, hence dirty oil.
	Do not get me wrong, I personally think syntetic oil is the totally
superior to conventional oil but just because the oil will last does not
mean you should leave it in for 10,000 or more miles.  If you want to run
synthetic do it but use it just like conventional oils.  Your bus will be
happier.

	Something else to consider, VW engines do not have water pumps and
radiators and run hotter in general to their water cooled/temp regulated
counterparts.  They also use the oil to disapate heat and help cool the
motor.  Plus some Synthetic manufacters stte not to use the in vehicles made
before 1980. Seals and gaskets maybe?  Don't no why, will try to find an
answer.

	I do have a	question regarding this topic though.  I have heard that one of
the properties of synthetics, which is not a problem in water cooled
vehicles could potentially be a problem in an air-cooled VW.  I have been
told by more than one mechanic and lubracation specialist, that synthetics
do not disapate heat as well and will actually raise the engines temp 5 to
10 degrees.  Does anyone have an answer?  I have been running mobil 1 in my
1978 Dautsun 280z for 8 years.  I bought the car with 138,000 miles on it,
it now has 413,000.  I change it every 2,500 miles and everytime I adjust
the valves (every 30,000 miles) I am amazed at how clean under the valve
cover is (good stuff).  Still have full compression and no oil loss between
changes.  I want to run mobil 1.  It is worth the additional 10 to 15
dollars an oil change for the benifits I have seen with my other car.
Please respond to the heat question.  I don't like conflicting answers.
