i have what could be a simple problem yet has me stumpped at the moment.

scenerio: a 1600 dp motor ...98k miles....religiously maintained ( p.o. and
myself )..._dot_compression 115 to 120 all the way around......valves set and tune
- ups regularly.   ok thats the basis....everything works great on this motor
except i have been unable to get the carb to run correctly.

it is a stock, original 34 pict 3.  stock aircleaner and preheat hoses.  all
jets...main, idle are stock size, choke is functioning normally, throtle shaft
has no play in it at all, accel. pump works fine.  basically a * perfect *
carb.  but i have never been able to get this thing to idle correctly.  

when i start it up in the morning, the choke closes and it fires up in one
turn of the starter.  idles fine until the choke begins to warm up and open
up.  so i just keep my foot on the gas and give it a few pumps and i m off and
running.  the thing runs great down the road, accelerates fine......but as
soon as i let off the gas it dies.  the ONLY way i have ever been able to get
it to NOT die when i let off the gas is if ..when i am zipping down the
freeway, i stomp it to the floor a couple of times it seems to * open *
something up or unclog a jet or something.  and then it will idle fine.  until
i shut it off and restart it again.  then the same scenario all over.  i have
rebuilt this thing so many times i have lost count.  am i missing something??
please help.......i am about ready to buy a NEW 34.3 , hoping this will do it.
they run about $125 including shipping and handling. ( thats the cheapest i ve
found so far )........i need advice, please......either a place to get a
better deal on a new carb or tell me what i am missing on this carb
problem........

tia..........zr
