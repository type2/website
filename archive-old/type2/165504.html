You don't need a &quot;kit&quot;.  What you need is a used alternator stand (OEM
german stands won't crack like the chinese stands).

If your present
generator is 30A you can use the tin, pulley, and fan hub on your new
alternator.

If your present generator is 38A, you will need the 30A generator or
alternator tin and fan hub.  Again, used OEM is better than aftermarket
for strength and fit.

You also need a alternator style (angled) fuel pump and the shorter
pushrod to go with it.  Replace the bakelite spacer under the pump as
well, as they get brittle after 30 years.
