Subject: knoking when clutch is down

I have a 73 2 ltre camper ,it started about 3 weeks ago and seems to be
getting louder as time goes on , also i noticed that the knocking sound
is now apparent even when the clutch is out.I am wondering if my clutch
is due for renewal or the flywheel going out , any info on what might be
causing this sound would be greatly appreciated.

thnx in advance
