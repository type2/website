Subject: Coil Failure Symptoms

I have been asking questions about testing coils.  Now it is time to 
reveal the symptoms that lead to these questions and other recent 
events related.  I have been having the engine momentarily die on me 
for a while, just a split second of misfiring, I thought.

Monday, on the way home and then to soccer practice (not cool to be 
late, I'm the coach) bus dies in heavy traffic.  A few minutes of 
attempting to start results in dead battery.  A helpful passenger in 
another vehicle helps push me off the road.  Call to AAA for towing 
or jump start.  Flat bed arrives and he won't even try to jump start 
as it quit in mid flight.  I have AAA Plus coverage, so 45 miles tow 
home is covered! Love that AAA Plus plan, worth ever penny.

Got home, unloaded, attach battery charger, leave and got to practice
only 20 minutes late.  Get home and proceed to diagnose bus.  No 
problems found.

Next morning, 6 am, 42 degrees out, bus dies.  Do diagnostics again, 
coil has zero spark.  Aha! Very nice medical type guy asks if I need 
assistance and offers to drive me to work, I say no, drives away, and 
then comes back to offer a phone call when he gets home.  Take him up 
and AAA arrives to tow me to local Trusty Mechanic. Thanks Eric!
Get goodies across street, hang out until they open at 8:00.  Good 
pastry shop!  Parts/service place opens, no part, no supplier can get 
part there until 10:30 at the earliest, oh well.  Marty behind 
counter leaves and returns with coil out of her own bus! as a loaner. 
Her '79 is there with a rod coming out of number 3, waiting for work. 
Way cool Marty!  Install, runs, go to work. Get back to shop and find 
that coil in stock would work, but has different part number than 
expected, but same as one on shelf.  $72 for that coil. All is well 
in the world again!

Intermittent cutting out, occasional misfiring could be due to 
bad/failing coil.  Check underneath coil for black goopy hard stuff that 
looks like oils and dirt caked together.  It is the innards of a coil 
oozing out, trying to tell you that it's days are numbered.
