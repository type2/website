Subject: Re: [T2] indash tunes

I have that same radio in my bus...  I hooked it up as it says to, with 
the yellow wire to constant power, red to ignition on power, and black 
to ground...  If that's how you hooked it up, you're ok... Now, for an 
accessory deal, i ran a wire from my second battery to a switch, and 
then the red wire on the radio...  If i turn the key on, the radio 
functions normally.  If i have the key off, and flip the switch, the 
radio functions normally...  Also, even if i accidentally have both on 
at the same time, there is no damage, and the radio functions normally. 
 There's no reason why you couldn't do the same thing with a single 
battery system.  Just run a wire from a constant power source through a 
dash switch, and splice it into the red wire on the radio... This way, 
you're not running your pertronix all the time, which is most likely not 
good for it...

&gt;Normally I wire digital stereos into a constantly hot circuit
&gt;so that it won't lose programs, and I don't have to have
&gt;the ignition on to hear NPR.
&gt;However, this stereo performs some gymnastic maneuvers
&gt;when the key is turned off, (kind of swallows it's face for
&gt;security reasons). 
&gt; Is it bad for the Pertronics points eliminator system to
&gt;be left on for long periods?
