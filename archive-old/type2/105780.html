Subject: Jerky fuel injection

&gt;My 2 litre accelerates in a tolerable but annoying
&quot;jerky&quot; manner, but 
&gt;only for the first 5 or 10 minutes after starting
from cold, or near 
cold. 
&gt;After that, it runs smooth and strong.
&gt;
&gt;This is particularly noticeable in first and second
gears. However, 
the 
&gt;idle seems fairly even and starting is flawless.
&gt;
&gt;I suspect a fuel problem,



One thing to check is the compression. If you have one
cylinder lower in compression then the others, it can
cause the AFM flap to fluctuate and that can cause you
lurching problem....Just a thought.

Good luck and let us know what you find.
