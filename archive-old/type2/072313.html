From years of traveling in Mexico, I can state categorically that there are 
THOUSANDS of type1 and type2 VWs there. Still. 

Every town has a knowledgeable VW mechanic. Most of the taxis in Mexico used 
to be yellow type1's.... my goodness, that was awhile ago, though. 

Parts are easily available for all kinds of VWs, including the older model 
VWs (before 68). 

There is a VW factory or two in the country and Brazil is still making Type 
2s as well.

&gt; The recent posts about driving in Mexico have me curious about the engines
&gt; in the Mexican Busses.  I know the most recent ones are water cooled,
&gt; starting in about 1998.  But before that, were they type 4 design or
&gt; something else?
&gt; 
&gt; I'm planning on doing some driving down there later this summer, and I was
&gt; wondering if any mechanical parts would be generally available.
&gt;
