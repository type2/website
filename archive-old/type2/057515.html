Subject: what to do (buy the Westfalia or not)
Content-type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII
Content-transfer-encoding: 7bit

I have located a bus that has been setting and the current title holder has no
idea what he has, or what condition it is (he inhertited it) its a 1979
Westfalia Deluxe, with gas stove / electric fridge, and the 2.0 motor. The
asking price is $400. 

BUT, It has been sitting, I DON'T know if it runs, or will run, and the engine
has been maintained by an amateur... (missing items, wiring messes, and visual
eye soars on the engine) all the FI equipment looks to be in place, but
external parts are missing from the engine.

I own a 1971, and a couple previous years... but have never owned the TYPE IV
motors. 

What should I look for to assure a good (decent) purchase. I will try to start
it but do not expect it to run. Do yuns think it is a good buy ??? Once I have
it at home I will again ask for more info on how to get it working...ie making
sure this and that are connected up or plugged in....
