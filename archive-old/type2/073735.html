Subject: Re: [T2] The journey of moisture and a change of heart about undercoating.

I grew up in a VW dealership during the 70s and 80s. 
I can remember Rusty Jones being sold to every
customer here in Northeastern Wisconsin.  It provided
a lot of revenue for my parents but I can also
remember the fall out when Rusty Jones went belly up
and the warranties associated with the rust proofing
were void. I can also recall rust proofing a few cars
myself and it being THE worst job in the shop, you
always got it on you and brill-o pads were the only
thing that worked at removing it. Incidentley, our
back lot was full of rusted parts cars where the old
rust proofing was the only thing holding a fender to
the car.

&gt; &lt;&lt; You're right...there's lots of epoxy paints out
&gt; there
&gt; these days &amp; other products designed to replace the
&gt; detrimental stuff VW put on there when they made
&gt; them.
&gt; I wish you good luck with your task. &gt;&gt;
&gt; 
&gt; Not to defend the factory; but I'm pretty sure
&gt; undercoating
&gt; was a dealer-installed revenue generator...Besides,
&gt; rust is
&gt; dealer-friendly, not owner-friendly...;-(
