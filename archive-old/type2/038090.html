Subject: Re: Small Electrical Connectors?

FLAPS -- Autozone? -- we found a package of teeny tiny little
gold-plated female crimp-on connectors. Like, 1/8&quot;. Like the ones that
connect on the back of the brake warning light in a bug, if that makes sense.

&gt; Anybody know where I can find some really small female electrical
&gt; connectors?  The ones that attach my wiring harness to the rear side marker
&gt; lights on my 73 Westy have rotted off (on the side where the battery is - go
&gt; figure!).  Now, I know I can fabricate something by cutting some regular
&gt; sized ones in half and such, but surely that particular size is available?
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks!
