Greg and the List,

I installed &quot;cool tin&quot; on my '69 Kombi when I built the engine a few years
ago.  It seems to work well but I doubt if I would do it again.  When you
install the cool tin a few modifications are needed.  I had to reshape the
heater box tin to get it to fit over the cool tin.  This was easily done with
a ball peen hammer.  Also, you no longer need the little pieces that go on the
rear by the pully tin and cylinder tin.  This isn't such a problem, but you do
wind up having to improvise a little because those pieces that you no longer
need had the captive nuts on them to secure the cylinder tin to the pully tin.
This can be overcome by putting a nut and bolt there.  Or, if you're really
creative, you can make your own captive nuts by welding some new ones on in
the appropriate place.

Anyway, it's not really a big deal, just be prepared for a little improvising.
I am in Oklahoma and it does get hot here.  I have had no problems with
cooling with this arrangement.

My $0.02 worth.

Hope to see some of you at BBA!
