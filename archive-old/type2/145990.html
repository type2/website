&gt; Somebody welded a ball joint in? OMG.
&gt; 

Hey guys   Funny thing was that the  new ball joint that came out wasn't the 
one that had been tack welded in place. these are new Nakata ball joints made 
in brazil for dana.  I am at a lost for why this came loose.I have installed 
hundreds of these and this is a first.   These things are a bear to remove and 
replace, takes a smoke wrench, air chisel and ball joint installer to do this 
job.  I have sent Chai a replacement arm with the ball joint installed and for 
safety reasons I have tack welded them together. After seeing what this one 
did I would recommend everybody doing the same.  You do have to remove the 
rubber boot to do this.  Later and have fun  Mark Dearing
