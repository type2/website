&lt;&lt; Get the current holder of the motor to carry it to the
freight companie's most local trucking terminal and you pick it up on your
end. Having them pick it up and drop it off at your specified location can
add several hundred $$$ to the cost and may even be impossible in some
residential areas because engine-sized loads are usually delivered as part
of a semi-trailer load. If they have to transfer it to a smaller truck for
local delivery you REALLY pay for it.

Agreed...I had about three hundred pounds of engine parts shipped from
Canada to NJ...It was about a hundred bucks, but only if I picked up the
crate myself at the terminal. Home delivery (about ten miles) would
have been another hundred... ;-(
