Subject: Details on my 1971 Crew Cab that is for sale.
X-Diagnostic: MESSAGE MAY NOT BE TOPICAL - S

Everyone,
Financial re-evaluating requires the sale of my 1971 crew cab. This has been 
my dream come true so it is tearing me up to have to do this. Since the late 
1980's I have searched for a crew cab that was reasonably priced and not 
rusty. Mostly, I'd just find overpriced rust buckets. Who wants to spend 
$4,000 on paint and body work alone? Not me. Well, my dream finally came true 
when I discovered the truck that you see here. The frame on this truck is 
superb. There is not one ounce of rust on any part of the frame. In fact, it 
is in remarkable condition. The floors are also in excellent shape. Ther are 
no holes in the cargo area (under the back seat) at all. The front floor only 
has a few pin holes from water collecting. The worst spot is where the door 
panels meet the floor sides. There are some larger holes about the size of a 
pencil eraser or smaller on each side. Other than that this truck is sweet! 
The body is nice also. From what I can tell the body has never been patched 
or bondoed for rust repair. You can see panels from the inside and I see no 
evidence of past repairs. The rust it does have is minimal. First, the cab. 
There are a few inches of rust on the passenger's side at the bottom of the 
nose behind the front bumper. This rust has been cut out so it is a hole. 
Other than that the nose is clean. The cab rockers are perfect. No rust. The 
roof had a small hole near the passengers side rear roof gutter. It is a 
strange rust hole, almost like someone had drilled there for an antenna. It 
is visible on the inside too(hole has been temp patched). The roof has a 
glass sunroof installed that is rusting around the edges. Repair or replace. 
I never decided.  The rear body has rust in both side rockers. The Driver's 
side has the section cut out and just needs minor patching. The passenger's 
side has a much smaller area but has yet to be cut out. Speaking of cut outs, 
the rear fendewells were cut for wide tires and flares (which I still have). 
The rear corners are rust free. One battery tray is rusted out and the other 
has been cut(??WHY??) and needs welding. The engine compartment was cut for a 
corvair engine. I have all the necessary parts to bring the metal back to 
stock.
Now to the important stuff, the bed and gates. The bed on this truck is 
PERFECT except for two problems. The previous owner cut out two sections of 
the bed to repair and never welded them back in. So, there is a whole strip 
of metal gone going across the bed right above the rear storage area. Also, 
an access panel was cut over the engine and that sheet metal panel is 
missing.  The side gates are in really good condition. I can see some bondo 
(mostly in the bottoms where they rest on the bed) but there are no visible 
holes or bubbles on the sides at all. The rear gate does have one big rust 
hole on one corner but it is fixible. There appears to be no bondo on the 
back gate. In fact, all gates appear to have original paint (with new primer 
spots)  on them. Don't know whey the truck got painted but not the gates.
Now on to details:
The interior is in good condition and does not need replacing. It features 
porsche 014 seats up front with a custom made center console in between. The 
seats are uphiolstered to match the door panels and rear seat in two tone 
black and white vinyl (basket weave). I have both the front and rear floor 
mats, have installed a new glove box, drilled and installed three gauges in 
the dash, added a tachometer, and re-wired a lot of missing items. The wiring 
is very solid in this bus. All repairs were done using wiring from another VW 
bus to match VW specs. There does need to be some final wiring done for back 
up lights and side markers in the rear (that was removed by prev owner). 
Speaking of which, this truck still has all mounting areas for the original 
reflectors, etc. Nothing has been altered.
Since purchasing the truck I have installed new: master cylinder, all brake 
noses, rear wheel cylinders, one front caliper, rear shoes, H-4 style 
headlamps, fueal lines and began to carpet the truck. I also modified a set 
of 1998 Mercedes 16 inch wheels to fit on the truck. These polished aluminum 
rims look sweet! The truck was a reliable daily driver until the corvair 
drivetrain gave out. I sold the engine and trans and was set to change it 
back to VW but ran out of money and couldn't find a donor bus.
Here are some other features of this truck:
Front and rear Chrome bumpers
Trailer hitch.
I also have restored split bench seat frames to return the bus to original 
seating and a complete split bench seat passenger's seat in case you are 
interested in putting things back original.

All in all this crew cab is one sweet ride. Can you buy a truck for less? 
Sure, but what are you really buying? Why spend $3,000 on a truck that needs 
$4,000 in body work alone?  Anyone will tell you that a good foundation is 
what to look for. This truck is it. If you pop in an engine and trans (and 
re-do the linkage, mounts, etc) you have a good to go street vehicle. As I 
stated, I am selling this only because of my financial situation. I am open 
to partial VW trades but I will need money AND a trade. Let me know if you 
are interested. I can send detailed pics of any area. Just ask. If I do not 
sell before May 10th I will not sell it. You can't go wrong with this truck. 
Check it out.
The price is only $4,000.
