Subject: Side Running lights/reflectors, front and rear.

I am looking for front and rear SIDE running lights/reflectors for our
two '71 buses.  I need the whole assembly for the dang things, not just
a lens or part.  Right now there are holes where those items should be,
front and rear.

They are pretty rare around the junkyards hereabouts.  Does anyone have
a source for new, used or whatever?  I need 4 front (but would settle
for 2--for my van, not the hubby's, heh, heh!) and 4 rear (but again,
would settle for 2).

It would be *really* cool if I could get them before I went to alaska in
july!

Thanks all,

Lauria
