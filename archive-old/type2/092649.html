Subject: Points on filing points

&gt;  I used a metal
&gt;double sided fingernail file (Jonel fine/medium) from the cosmetics section
&gt;of the grocery store.  Because it was so thin and flat I was able to use a
&gt;sawing action.  A really big pit would take a long time to file but with the
&gt;small pit I had, the file evenly did both sides pinched by the spring action
&gt;of the points. I use Bosch points if there is any doubt.

Two problems with filing points. New points come with polished, radiused 
faces. When you file them, you get flat surfaces that are only parallel 
when open the width of the file. When they close, they contact near the 
edge. Also, the mass that is lost to filing means they cannot take the heat 
near as well. So, filed points are nothing like new points and will only 
last for short mileage before pitting and burning again. Keep an extra new 
set of points on hand. Most of the VW dizzies ust the 01 011 points which 
cost $3 or less.

If I needed to refurbish a set of points to get to civilization, I would 
only file the tit off the one side, then polish both sides with very fine 
emory or crocus cloth, and replace them at the first opportunity with a new 
set.
