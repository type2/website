Subject: Re: [T2] heater cable

&gt; Oh, type II sages....I've got a big ole mess on my hands!  when replacing
&gt; the right heater cable, it broke off inside the tube that runs from front
&gt; to back.  It and the rubber coating are stuck in there.  Does anyone have a
&gt; magical answer on how to get the old cable out short of replacing the
&gt; entire cable tube or clamping a replacement tube right next to it.  It does
&gt; get cold occasionally here in north florida and I'm a wimp in the cold.

do you have an air compressor?? if so try blowing the cable out, I would
reccomend putting a board or something similar to deflect it if it should
blast out the end... I personally would blow it back the way it came if
possible since you know it will fit through
