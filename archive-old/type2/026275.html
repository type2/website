Not if you dry them out properly afterwards (preferably in a warm place
- you keep them in the house so you've already won half the battle).  I
use hand cleaner and do it while I wash my hands.  Kill two birds with
one stone!  Rinse them off well with hot water and they come up like
new.  For tools that are more prone to rust (not plated or stainless) I
wipe them over with a small amount of *clean* oil, ie not used engine
oil :-O before putting them away.
I just noticed there's no bus content in here, but hey, if you love your
bus you should pay attention to tool hygiene, so this stuff is important

&gt; Washing in water makes things rusty so how does everyone else
&gt; clean &amp; care for their tools ?
