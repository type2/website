Bear in mind that a Westfalia equipped/converted bus with a Dormobile
&quot;elevating roof&quot; is NOT a &quot;Dormobile&quot;.  It is simply a Westfalia with a
Dormobile roof assembly.

Type 2s converted by Dormobile had an interior unique to Dormobile and quite
unlike any Westfalia interior.

&gt;&gt;  As the proud owner of Scott's interior, which I'm going to put in my bus
that I got from Chuck in a moment of madness, here's my .02: The bus I
rescued from Chuck hasn't had a lot of funky things done to it -- it
still had dished washers in the CVs -- but it's a mere shell. It does
NOT have jalousie windows; it has a one-piece window on the left side
behind the driver (my 73 has a vent behind the driver that the closet
blocks). The 69 also has a one-piece left rear side window, fixed vent
wings, a front bench seat, and a small pop-top. There are also holes cut
in the floor right about where the sink and stove would be. It would
have had a full-width bed.

I thought the Dormobiles had the same interior. The pics I saw from
Scott looked like Jersey's Dor at last year's Everybus.  &lt;&lt;
