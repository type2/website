&gt; Your exhaust headers must be a whole lot different than mine -- mine
&gt;are exactly the same, both sides.

Then you don't have any heat, do you?  There are tradeoffs for a FULL 
header/extractor exhaust.  I'm sure that that wasn't one that VW was 
prepared to make.  Nor I, for that matter.

&gt;Recycling an older vehicle is preferable to buying a new machine,
&gt;with all the attendant pollution involved in creating that new vehicle,
&gt;waste of resources, etc. Plus it's a camper.

Then drive a beetle or rabbit, etc and buy a tent!  

&gt;riding a bike is
&gt;pretty scary. Bums me out, because I assumed I'd be able to ride to work
&gt;-- I've tried it a few times, but it's not worth the risk.

Then move closer to town.  As a self-described EarthFirster, you surely
realize that cities are better for the environment as a whole than 
suburban sprawl.  Then walk.

&gt;Well, at this point it's more like you could build an electric car.
&gt;And yes that's something I'd really like to do -- OTOH, I'd still want
&gt;to keep a Westy around.

What about CNG?  Or the whole ecodiesel thing?  Or just a more fuel 
efficient car?

&gt; Gee -- pretty hostile, aren't you?

Nope.  Just honest with myself.  I care about the environment, but my 
habits dictate that I call myself what I am- the typical American glutton.
Now, I'm working on this, but I can only say that it's a goal.  And I know
of few Americans who are doing absolutely Everything they can to save
our environment.  Including you, no matter what you think.

&gt;I think my environmentalist activities and credentials are pretty
&gt;well known in those circles.

Credentials, shmredentials.  We all need to wake up, stop deluding 
our little brains, and realize that what we drive are nothing more than
leaking, polluting behemoths that should be crushed or kept in museums
and replaced with modern, less polluting vehicles made of recycled
materials (that are themselves recyclable).  Now, I'm not advocating
this, just expressing the most LOGICAL course of action.  But who
ever said that human beings were logical creatures?  I'm pretty sentimental
myself.

&gt;So what are you doing to help your Mother?

I'm trying, no pretensions, no credentials, no labels.
