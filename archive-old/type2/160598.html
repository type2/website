Subject: Re: [T2] fuel pump question

&gt; i guess my real queston is there any way to
&gt;bench test the fuel pump.   i have an ac to dc 12 volt  converter in my
&gt;shop.     can i hook up the two leads and  try to pump some fuel from a gas
&gt;can or something to eliminate the faulty fuel pump theory?

Sure. Just run some hose into a gas can:

Hey, Richard, are you saying / showing that the FI fuel pump can suck gas in
as well as pump gas out?!?!

I thought that gas had to be gravity fed into the fuel pump (via the fuel
filter).  So how high can I have the FI fuel pump above the petro can??  How
about 3 feet??
