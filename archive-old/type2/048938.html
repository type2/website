Isaiah,

Try DPR racing. Costly, but an excellent crank grinder. I just picked up an
80mm counterweighted and balanced crank from them for a 2316cc Type 4 I'm
building. Also got my rods from them as well.

German vs. Brazilian isn't as important as forged vs. cast. Spend the money on
forged. Now, with that being said, quality on German stuff tends to be a good
bit better, and if you buy the DPR racing crank, you're already going to be in
for a good bit of money, so you might as well get the German p&amp;c's.

&gt; Also, is there a tremendous difference in German vs. Brazilian
&gt; p&amp;c's as far as reliablity, performance, and general karma?
