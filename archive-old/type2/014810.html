There were two different visors used. Some can swivel, others can not. I do
not know for sure, but I think that the Deluxes had the swiveling kind, and
the Kombi/Westy did not. I have had sets of both and swapped in swiveling
kind for fixed.

i have a '70 westy, and my sun visors are fixed on the inside end.  however,
the mounts on both interior sides are brokend, and i've tried swivelling...
no go.  a spacer might do it...

8)&gt;&gt;permanently attached at the inside (by the mirror) but I've 
8)&gt;since found that
8)&gt;&gt;not all Busses came that way.  
8)&gt;&gt;
8)&gt;&gt;If your problem relates to the outer pivot, there is 
8)&gt;probably only 1 correct
8)&gt;&gt;way to screw them in and if you get the pivot mount upside 
8)&gt;down (180 degrees
8)&gt;&gt;off) the pivot angle will run you into the roof.
8)&gt;
8)&gt;
8)&gt;I just found some useable visors at the wreckers and put them on
8)&gt;my 70 westy.  They too, are attached at the inside point.  What
8)&gt;I did notice is that my originals had a spacer piece that matched
8)&gt;the outer pivot oval and seemed to 'raise' the outer pivot out
8)&gt;over the wood panels and would allow them to be pivoted with ease.
8)&gt;The spacers had a VW part # (sorry, didn't write it down) and 
8)&gt;were not present on the donor bus (71 kombi, ie. no wood panels)
8)&gt;Can any other Westy owners confirm this piece?
8)&gt;
8)&gt;Funny, although I have this spacer,  the visors I took off didn't
8)&gt;pivot.  They were attached at the inside point, albeit broken,
8)&gt;hence the need for replacement.
