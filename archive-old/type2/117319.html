Subject: Re: [T2] 2.0L Rebuild saga

&gt; i bought a 74 westy with a 2.0L single carb'd GEX rebuild with only a few
&gt; thousand miles on it. when i bought it cylinders 1, 2, &amp; 4 were firing
&gt; around 120 but my #3 cylinder was losing alot of compression. upon tearing
&gt; the engine apart i have found that the head gasket is cracked/broken which
&gt; deffinitely could bethe culprit. my question is this...

about normal for a GEX, the VW has no head gasket, or do you mean the seal
rings on top of the cyl jugs into the head, VW says not to use those
anymore

&gt; i know gex rebuilds are shotty so should I:
&gt; 
&gt; a)replace the gasket &amp; slap the motor back together hoping that the
&gt; compression problem will be fixed
&gt; 
&gt; b)have the lower end checked out
&gt; 
&gt; c)have the upper end inspected and possibly rebuild the entire top end to
&gt; fix the low quality GEX heads

D)  use it as a core to buy a decent engine.  (probably the most cost
effective solution in the long run)
