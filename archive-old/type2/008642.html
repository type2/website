Subject: '72 nose panel -- thanks
To: type2_at_type2_dot_com

Hi Volks,

thanks to everyone who replied about the '72 nose panel
issue.  Looking at the prices for new replacement panels
I think I am going to follow one listee's suggestion
to have a pro hammer the dents out... can't be more than
159 pounds + shipping from Britain that the Schofield
panel would cost, and it will be more original and 
structurally solid too.

(And I do have a '71 nose clip... cut at frame and roof.
I am just wary of sacrificing it for the repair of minor
dents in what's to be my daily driver -- one day I might
actually need it to repair a major &quot;front-ender&quot;.  God
forbid.  :-)

Airhowlingly yours,
   Erik.
