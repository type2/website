good luck heating your open field at 4000 and 9000 BTUs.  The thing looks
identical to the &quot;Handi Heater&quot; thing I have.  Mine only requires a small
opening for fresh air venting, which my leaky bus has plenty of.  The one
thing that did strike me about yours was that it says it isn't to be used

...safe heat for chilly garages, tents, patios, porches, cabins, fishing
shanties (shanties?  heh), truck caps (caps?  cabs perhaps) and barns and
so on. 

just provide a little vent for it and you should be fine i would think.
i've not managed to gas my family using mine yet, but i am still trying.
please don't hold me accountable should you be successful in gassing
