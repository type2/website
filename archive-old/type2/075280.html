The proper pronunciation is more or less &quot;vest-Fall-ya&quot;  with the emphasis 
on Fall.  That's how a German would pronounce it.  In English-speaking 
countries, it's whatever floats-yer-boat since we don't adhere to many of 
the German-language pronunciation rules.

&gt; &gt; What BTW is the correct pronunciation?  I usually hear
&gt; &gt; west FAYL ya but have also heard west FALL ya.
&gt; &gt; Consensus?
