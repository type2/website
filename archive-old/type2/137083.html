exactly.  What's going to be really interesting is when the ultra 
megasquirt comes out because it will have complete control over the 
timing curve, moreso than you could ever do with any mechanical 
distributor.  The real question, like richard is asking, is what is that 
curve.

Once nice feature about the tuning tools for megasquirt is they help you 
to find your engine's torque curve for tweaking the fuel flow.  I would 
venture to guess that the peaks and valleys in the torque curve are the 
points where you'd want advance to kick in, or retard, respectively.  If 
I remember correctly, they do kick in around the same points that the 
stock dizzy kicks in the mechanical advance... I'll have to check 
that... richard, this may answer your question ;)

I am very excited to play with the UMS because I've heard many 
discussions regarding how much influence the timing of an engine can 
have over an engine's performance - moreso than FI.
