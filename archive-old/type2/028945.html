A dead give away is the chassis number the third digit is the last digit in
the year. i.e. 218 bla bla bla is a 68 or 78. FYI 68 and 69 have only 9
digits and 70-79 have 10. Be careful with the engine code here as both 78
and 79 are GE. 78 is GE 0 007 083 thru GE 0 039 331 and 79 is GE 0 039 332
thru GE 0 058 786. The exhaust on the 75-78 has a triangular flange on the
rear of the heat exchanger that the exhaust pipes attach to. Good luck.

Subject: [T2] Difference between 78 and 79s..


Is there an easy way to VISUALLY tell the difference between a 78 and
79?  I know they have different exhausts, but is it an apparent
difference?  There is a bus I'm purchasing and it's a 78 and I just want
to make sure it's not a 79 engine.  I checked the engine codes and it's
a GE, and Unca Joel Walker's FI interchange lists a GE case as used on
both the 78 and 79 engines..

Any insight would be welcome..

Thanks!
Mike
