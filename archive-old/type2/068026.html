Sounds a lot like the Single Cab used to haul around the Empi &quot;Inch
Pincher&quot; back in the 60's.  There is a book out on VW performance history
during the 60's (British Puiblisher I think) and there are several pics of
this car-carrier looking truck.  Does anyone know which book I'm referring
to?  I just glanced through it at the book store.
