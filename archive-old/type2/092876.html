Subject: Re: [T2] Berg Temperature manual

That would be the technical manuals.

VERY good information but be ready for his opinion that he knows EVERYTHING.

Also he constantly refers to the parts his CO makes to solve the problem 
referenced.

Still worthwhile in my opinion.


&gt;Supposedly Berg has put together a manual of some sort on VW engines and heat.
&gt;Anybody bought this thing ?
&gt;Is it worth a flip ?
