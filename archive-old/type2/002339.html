Subject: Save a '77 Camper
Date: Sun, 8 Apr 2001 09:55:57 -0400
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

I saved a '77 VW Camper from going to the trash dump and now I
don't know what to do with it.  It was in a 'self storage' yard and the
owner had not paid his bill in about 4 years.  The guy who owns the
storage yard was going to sell it to the junk yard but I have him $100
for it.  I only have a bill of sale, no title and no keys.  I have tried to
find
the original owner but cannot locate him.  Everything seems to be there
in the van.  It has sink, refrig, all the curtains, nice pull out cot
overhead,
nice canvas on the pop-top, nice dash, all the glass is in good
condition, etc etc..  Body has the usual rust places
but seems to be pretty straight.  Anyway, I already have a '71 that
is my main VW, so I want to pass this one on to someone who may be
interested in putting it back on the road.  If no one is interested, then I
guess I will part it out to get my money back.  If anyone is interested
please let me know.  I am close to Raleigh, NC.
                                                  Bill &amp; Janyce
