Dave - Dan,

    Do yourselves a big favor, pull the tanks. Clean them with muriatic
(Wal-Mart)  acid, flush with large amount of water, followed by acetone to
displace the water, seal with butyl (automotive paint store) paint,  replace
the filter,  install your new injectors and then hit the road.
    In the long run you will save your self a lot of grief.

&gt; Dan,
&gt;
&gt; I had the same thing on my 78, except it had sat 8 years.
&gt;
&gt; What is left of 8 year old gasoline is rock hard ugly &quot;evil&quot; stuff.
&gt;
&gt; I could only get it out of the metal lines from the tank by using lacquer
&gt; thinner and pushing a piece of balling wire into it until I go it cleaned
&gt; out.  It took almost 3 hours off and on to get the outlet pipe from the
&gt; tank to the filter cleaned out.
&gt;
&gt; DISCLAIMER-
&gt; THe next part is probably *very* dangerous as lacquer thinner is seriously
&gt; explosive.  I have been extremely careful with it....don't do this unless
&gt; you are wide awake and have a fire extinguisher close....preferably
&gt; outside at least 50 feet away from everything!
&gt;
&gt; Needless to say, the two little pipes on the gas tank were rock solid
&gt; also.  Here is what I did.  Put 1 gallon of lacquer thinner and 1 gallon
&gt; of gas in the tank....left it for two weeks...every time I walked by, I
&gt; rocked the bus a little to slosh it around.  Finally got my reward on
&gt; Sunday.  I finally got both pipes opened up.
&gt;
&gt; Went and bought 2 clear throwaway filters and the cheapest electric fuel
&gt; pump(5-9psi) I could buy at the flaps.  I hooked the gas tank pipes up to
&gt; the electric pump and just rotated the fluid inside for 15
&gt; minutes...filter looks really ugly now, but it *is* pumping well.  This
&gt; weekend I will drain what is in the tank and refill with the same combo
&gt; and run the pump again for a while....you get the idea...
&gt;
&gt; I really don't expect the cheap fuel pump to last too long with the
&gt; lacquer thinner running thu it, but if it saves me from taking the tank
&gt; out, I will be thrilled.
&gt;
&gt; All of this *before* I hook the tank back in to the fi system as I have 4
&gt; new injectors and wouldn't want *any* of this stuff in them.
&gt;
&gt; The stuff that is in the tank is &quot;evil&quot;.  You get it on your hands and it
&gt; doesn't come off except with lacquer thinner....and it smells *really*
&gt; bad.  I'm not sure what I will do with the drained mixture of lacquer
&gt; thinner and gas as I wouldn't put it in anything and run it.  I expect to
&gt; take it to my local hazardous materials recycling center.
&gt;
&gt; I know that the proper thing to do would be to take the tank out and have
&gt; it cleaned at the radiator shop....which I might do when I pull the
&gt; engine...but not before...just want to be able to drive it some soon so I
&gt; can figure out what kind of shape everything else is in, and start fixing
&gt; it.
&gt;
&gt; Cheers, dave
&gt;

&gt; &gt; Greetings List,
&gt; &gt; Here is the situation: Took the Bus (78) to get emissions today and the
&gt;  guy said he couldn't get it to high enough RPM's, it kept &quot;spurting&quot;.
&gt; He says he thinks the fuel system is dirty and I should change the
&gt; filter...
&gt; &lt;snip for brevity&gt;

&gt;
&gt; &gt; Thanx in advance
