&gt;Question is: How do you install test things? There are no bolts or clips.
Do
&gt;they mount on the inside or outside?


&gt;There should be a groove running around the frames.  It just snaps into the
&gt;front, inside of the window frame on each side.  Don't force them in or out
&gt;though as one of mine snapped that way. Ok now that I think about it, do you
&gt;have the sliding windows or the jalousie kind? Those instructions are for the
&gt;sliding kind.

  The screens I had in my ' 73 sportsmobile &amp; the ones in my '71 kombi ( I 
don't know why it has jalousie windows) both go in from the inside by first 
inserting the top of the screen &amp; then swinging the bottom into place and 
letting it drop down into the bottom channel, which being shallower than the 
top channel keeps the screen from falling out. Now the half screen in my     
' 74 's sliding side window I've not figured out yet. Doesn't seem to come 
out, just slides.
