&gt;BN4 Heater For Sale
&gt;
&gt;Still in bus which was restored by previous owner. Fully connected so I
&gt;assume it has all the parts. I havn't tried to start it because I have a
&gt;fear of gasoline and know it hasn't been started in at least 5 years.
&gt;
&gt;It is in a 1969 Westy.
&gt;
&gt;Make an offer! (I know what they usually sell for.)

Eric,  don't be afraid of it, they have worked safely in vehicles, even
airplanes for over 60 years!!  I have almost 30 busses at my place and 4
have had engine fires, but in working on gas heaters for almost 20 years, I
have NEVER seen a gas heater that had caught fire.  You would love the heat
your heater puts out and you already have it installed!!!  If you leave it
in your bus and have it checked, it will increase the value of your bus.
If you take it out, you have to pull the engine and gas tank to get all the
ducts out and there will be two large holes where the ducts go through the
bus.

Don't sell it, get it checked over, you'll LOVE IT!!!!!!
