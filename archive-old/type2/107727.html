Subject: New starter on 78 Westfalia

I am working on my first Starter installation on my 78 Westfalia Bus.
I have researched the list and found some great information for
installation instructions.. Thanks ! 

Couple questions:

1) Do I have the right starter ? I ordered a new starter from one of our favorite 
    vendors and they sent me a brand new (not rebuilt) Bosch starter. On
    the order paperwork it says product number SR87X. On the actual Bosch
    Starter is says 9 000 042 035. The problem is I looked at my old starter
    and I have 2 seperate wires plugged into two spade connections on
    the starter selenoid. On the new stater there is only one spade connector.

    I called the vendor today and they said this is the correct starter and
    that I may need to wire it differently !! ?? 

    Can anyone shed some light on if this is the correct starter and how
    I should connect it to this starter with only one spade connector ?

2) Was it a good decision to go with a brand new Bosch starter, or should
     I have gotten a rebuilt ? In hindsight the rebuilts seem to have a 
     longer warranty, the vendor says my new Bosch only has a 6 month warranty,
     and the rebuilts have 2 years (I know I should have checked into this before purchasing).

3) I did not get a new Starter bushing with the starter, will have to get one elsewhere. 
    Can anyone tell me the correct size threads for a bolt to try to thread it in and
    pull it out once I have the old starter out ? Is it tough removing this bushing 
    and installing a new bushing ?

Thanks !
