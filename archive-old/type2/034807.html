Subject: Re: Sliding door rust

&gt; Hey.
&gt;     What can be done about rusted (to the point of nonexistence) lower
&gt; sliding door channels?  Mine works, but it's really tough to do, and I'm
&gt; the only one who can do it.  The inner wall of the channel is gone
&gt; toward the front of the bus, so I have to open the door halfway, pull
&gt; out on the bottom (not too far!!) and then open the door the rest of the
&gt; way.  I can tell that it gets worse every time.
&gt;
&gt;     Is there some kind of kit or repair piece available for this?  I
&gt; worry about just taking it to a body shop and letting them rig up
&gt; something based on what is there.  I'd rather have a piece to weld in.
&gt; Do they sell them, or do I need a donor bus?  Anyone have a donor '77
&gt; with a good body for cheap (yeah right)?
&gt;

Bus depot had all the parts on their site last time I looked. My bus is
exactly the same. Its gonna be spendy though I think to fix it. I haven't
had mine fixed yet, but talked to a VW restoration place nearby for 30
minutes about whats involved, so this is second hand information but from a
good source (i hope).

There are three main pieces to the bottom track. An inner and outer rocker
panel (only abou $12 to $15 each) and the main track that is on the up side
of the slot (get on knees and look at the top of the slot), they run about
$110 to $120. Then you need to have a body shop cut out the rusted area and
weld in the new area. If you can find a junked out bus with a good track and
rocker panels, you can cut it out and weld it in yours, but personlly, I
would rather just have the new parts unless you can do the cutting and
welding yourself. Luckily I don't think I'm gonna have to replace the track,
just the rockers. The door has two lower bearings, one that sits
horizontialy and rides in the upper track and keeps the door from moving
side to side (so door can't be pulled away from bus), and another one that
is vertical that supports the weight of the door, it rides along the top of
one of the rocker panels. On mine, the problem is that the rocker panel is
rusted and the vertial bearing falls down into it were there is mass rust,
this causes the horizontal bearing to fall out of the upper track, allowing
the door to moved about as well as causing the bearing at the top of the
door to fall out of the track near the top of the bus. As long as I hold the
door up so that the horizontal bearing stays in the track, I can open ok
most the time, but it catches and bent rusted metal sometimes and non of my
friends know how to work it.

If too much rust is at the end of the slot (most likly the front of the
slot), then there might not be enough metal to weld the new parts to. If
this is the case (as I think it might be for mine), then you have to have
good metal cut out of another bus to have welded in place of the rusted out
area so that there is good metal to weld the rockers to.

Hope this helps...
