Subject: VW Trends

This really is a loss, since it was the only mainstream glossy that addressed
a wide range of issues and interests.  Unlike Hot VWs which remains more
geared to the California Bug community and radical mods, VW Trends was a
resource for anyone with a VW, be it bugs, buses or whatever.

I hope the publisher has some hope of re-establishing something to fill the
void created by the loss of VWT.
