Subject: Hello, I'm back

It's been awhile since I've been on this list.  My bus has been neglected
because, we had a son and bought an old house.  Between taking care of my son
and fixing the house I have had no time for the bus.  I also got into computer
flight simulators for awhile.

When I was last hanging around the list, I had done a lot of body repair with
a lot of advice from Kelly aka Metwiz and cobbled together and installed an
Eberspacher BN4 with help from the articles in the library.

My bus runs great, but I have an oil leak to hunt down.  But I do have a
question:  I need to install a shild seat for my son.  (He's 2).  I have a 73
camper.  Is there a brand of seat that would fit in the bus?  How would I
install it?  We are hoping to take my son camping this spring.  We haven't
gone since before he was born.

Thanks for the help and it's nice to be back.
