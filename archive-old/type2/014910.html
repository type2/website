&gt;It's time to replace what is left of the engine  compartment seal in the '69
&gt;bus. The motor is the original stock 1600spsr setup.
&gt;First the seal is in 3 parts. Two of the seals are the same length and are
&gt;split. The other is shorter and without the split.
&gt;
&gt;Would you recomend removal of the rear
&gt;valance or even the engine in order to remove that remains of the old seal
&gt;and to install the new ones. 

Chris,

The split seal goes on the rear apron and the sides above the valve covers.  
The seal without the split goes where the front engine tin meets the 
firewall.

Pull the engine to replace all but the rear apron seal.
