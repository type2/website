&gt; Sorry - I came in late on this. I don't know how much
&gt; effort you have put into checking for inadequate
&gt; venting of fuel tank or possible intermittent blockage
&gt; of fuel tank outlet. It is very unlikely to have an
&gt; intermittent blockage in a continuous flow system but
&gt; could happen if the fuel line is breaking down

have left the fuel cap off while trying.

thought of the intermittent blockage in the tank, not sure what I can do
there.

&gt; internally. Have you run the outlet from the fuel pump
&gt; into a gas can and just let it run for a few gallons
&gt; (best to do at return line probably, for easier
&gt; access.)

no I haven't

&gt; I see you had 10psi residual pressure from overnight.
&gt; That's good at least - that there is any! I assume
&gt; that you checked it at pressure and it was within
&gt; range.

it is Textbook right on, taken at the sample port between #1 &amp; #2

&gt; What about the possibility of the resistor pack
&gt; overheating or otherwise failing? That could easily be
&gt; a several minute delay type item. I was also thinking

swapped in a spare resistor pack. known good

&gt; of loose connectors at the double relay but that would
&gt; be even more intermittent than yours. You have a
&gt; pattern.

swapped in a spare double relay.
&gt;
&gt; There was no chugging or

not sure what you mean by &quot;Chugging&quot; it does lots of those kinds of things

&gt; black smoke to indicate a too
&gt; rich mixture, right? I saw it mentioned a few times
&gt; that maybe it was flooding, but if so, you should have
&gt; had some black smoke and the engine would have
&gt; definitely been chugging.

if you look at the exhaust just the right way you can see it is slightly
(rich) black and the plugs are showing slight signs of being rich but have
tried new plugs

&gt; You have eliminated an exhaust plug also, I assume...

best I can
&gt;
&gt; Things most likely to fail when warmed up? Coil,
&gt; condensor (and with it, points), any resistors,

have swapped in spare coil, condensor, points resistors.

&gt;temp
&gt; sensors... BaH

how do you measure that while engine is running???

thanks
Bob
