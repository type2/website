Subject: How/why did you get your first bus?  (friday ramblings, long)

With the talk over the past few digests over the age of people on the
list, I've gotten to thinking a bit about what draws us all to these boxy
old monsters.  There are people on this list ranging from their mid-teens
to their mid-60s.  There are now drivers who were not BORN yet when the
last of the breadloaves were sold in the U.S.  I'm a little curious as to
how long you've been driving your bus, what made you choose it, etc.  It
is Friday, after all.

I'll even start off.  I'm 23, and I have known for my whole life that a
Bus was the car for me.  When I was very young and living on a farm in New
Hampshire some friends of the family had what must have been a brand new
(at the time)  bright blue &amp; white bus.  My memories of it are pretty
foggy (I was only maybe 4-5 at the time ) but I knew that it was the
coolest thing I had ever seen and that I wanted one.  The fact that our
family car was a rusted-out Buick Estate Wagon may have had something to
do with the appeal of the bright shiny bus.  It even *sounded* cool - not
like the Buick or the trucks, more like a tractor. :)

When I was old enough to get my license, I hunted around but couldn't find
one in my price range.  Our friends offered to sell me theirs, but it was
way too expensive.  I owned an '81 Escort, then a diesel Rabbit (which
I absolutely loved), then a Chevette, then 2 more diesel Rabbits and
various other &quot;disposable&quot; (i.e. couple-hundred-dollar) cars.  I got my
first bus (a rusted out '67 Kombi) for free, replaced the engine for a
couple of hundred bucks and drove it for about a year.  However, I was
still in school at the time (i.e. broke) and was watching the poor old bus
fall apart due to rust.  I finally sold it to a guy who was going to fix
it up so he could give *his* bus to his wife.  

After I sold the Bus I inhereted my mom's 90 Jetta.  The mileage was
pretty high for a car that new (maybe 130k when I got it), but other than
a few arguments with the dealer I was pretty happy with it.  I had thought
about trading it in on something after I graduated but hadn't really done
anything about it.  The weekend after I got my first post-college paycheck
I picked up the paper and there it was: a '74 Bus.  Within a few hours of
seeing the ad, I was driving it home.  No, I didn't carefully consider the
condition it was in, nor did I look around to see if I could find any
others to compare it to, nor did I really have any idea what I was getting
myself into by buying one with a pancake engine.  I just kinda got in,
started it up, heard the familiar sound of an aircooled engine and said
&quot;it's mine&quot;.  

Every once in a while I think maybe I'll try to sell this one and find one
that's in better shape, but all I need to to to convince myself otherwise
is get in and drive it somewhere.  As I'm sure many of you know, driving
the bus is an experience that's difficult to explain to someone who hasn't
owned one: they're just *nice* to drive.  Sure they have the handling
characteristics of the Taj Mahal on roller blades, but there's just
something nice about cruising along with that big horizontal steering
wheel and knowing that when something goes wrong I can probably figure out
what it is and get myself home because I don't have to worry about ABS or
an engine computer or air conditioning and because the way they're put
together *makes sense*.  Besides, when you fix something once you know how
to fix it if it happens again, and over time I've gotten better at making
sure it doesn't happen again.  I'm still not a mechanic - I've never
actually opened up an engine, though I think I'm going to try a valve
adjustment when I put in my new exhaust.  (Muir in hand, of course.)  

I guess one of the things I'm interested in is what we all have in common
besides our love for these crazy old vans.  It's not a &quot;hippie&quot; thing in
the 60s sense of the word, since some of us weren't even born yet.  It
doesn't seem to be a class thing; I'd imagine there are people on this
list who make a pretty hefty amount of money every year, and I've known
quite a few Bus owners who were pretty strapped for cash (hence the
practicality of a car you can live in).  Politically I lean pretty far to
the left, but I'm betting that not all of you do.  Anyway, I guess I'm
just interested in what you have to think about this (assuming you
bothered to read this far).  

Well, I guess that's enough for now.  I don't know if I came right out and
said *why* I drive a bus, but I'm hoping most of you understand at least
some of what I'm saying here.
