You're asking a difficult question.

I'm driving an 83 Westfalia Aircooled that I purchased with 145K and I've
now got 256K on it.

At 215 K I blew #4cylinder trying to go 80 MPH against the wind, seemed
to just go Diesel on me (broke a ring) . I put new jugs and pistons on it
with new rod bearings and other than that I've never had a part to fail,
any part  !!

Well just windshield washer pumps, clutch master cylinders but never
anything that crippled me on the side of the road.

I'd carry a spare set of plugs, points, distributor cap, rotor and fuel
filter. Also take some type of fuel additive that will remove water from
the fuel system. If you're real handy you could take a spare set of
brushes for your alternator and a spare alternator belt.

But everything I mentioned could be installed before you leave town and
just keep the used parts for spares.

Make a note of the approved parts sources with their 800 numbers and
phone numbers of other list members along your route. Post a list of the
cities you'll be passing through or near and we'll all respond if your
going to be in our area. If your van dies &quot;we'll help&quot;.
