Anyone know of an easier way of replacing the rear hatch hinges? Other
than the same way they come out, which (in my case) involved every dirty
word I know, several pinched fingers, a new hole in my hand, and several
ritual sacrafices?   :)

The hinges were destroyed by the D.P.O. and I have opened the hatch at
my own peril for the past 2 years. This past weekend, I found a
rust-bucket, basket-case bus at the salvage yard and removed the hinges.

Actually, the hinges are not the problem... it's those torsion springs.

Yes, I DID search the archives...I guess it's one of those nasty jobs
no-one wants to talk about.
