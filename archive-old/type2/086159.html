Subject: RE: [T2] alternator replacement &amp; pulley

&gt; BTW, during EveryBus I installed a new Bosch starter which I got from Bus
&gt; Depot.  That thing kicks butt.  It spins the engine very quickly, and as a
&gt; result the engine starts quite a bit faster than it did with my
&gt; old worn out
&gt; starter.  Also got rid of the &quot;starter lag&quot; I would occasionally have with
&gt; the old starter on a hot engine, where it was like Rrr Rrr R&lt;silence, no
&gt; cranking&gt; Rrr Rrr.
&gt;
&gt; Only thing about the new starter is that it only has 1 push-on terminal on
&gt; the solenoid so for us FI types that means installing a piggyback
&gt; connector
&gt; to hook both wires (wire from ignition switch and wire to double relay) up
&gt; to the solenoid.  The new Bosch starter is made in Mexico and from what I
&gt; can tell so far, that's not a problem.  We shall see how it lasts.


This was a very fortunate find as far as I'm concerned.  Bosch supposedly
only sells a rebuilt version here in the U.S. but it turns out that a
Mexican made new starter is the identical part, and still available brand
new south of the border.  So this new starter comes to us &quot;sideways&quot; by way
of Bosch/Mexico, for _less_than Bosch charges here in the States for a
rebuilt one - $99.95 our price - and without a core deposit or the
hassle/cost of sending your core back.  Considering that even the rebuilt
Bosch's are sometimes rebuilt in Mexico anyway, there is no downside - you
just get a new one for cheaper than rebuilt.  I've had them for over a year
now and haven't had even a single defect - seems quality control is great!
Hopefully these will continue to be available forever. :-)  Incidentally, we
are still using the Bosch/USA &quot;rebuilt&quot; part number for these, SR87X (which
fits '76 to early '81 with manual trans), but you will actually get the new
one when you order it.
