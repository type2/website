Subject: Re: Old cases and faying surfaces

&gt;All the faying surfaces are totally black

What is a &quot;faying surface&quot;?

Is that a verb, &quot;to fay&quot;? Does &quot;fay&quot; mean &quot;to hold a bearing&quot;?

(I am not kidding so if you guys are going to amuse yourselves at my
expense then at least answer the question while you're doing it. ;)
