Subject: Re: [T2] oil cooler answer/header wrap

&gt;....wrap my header in insulating tape to prevent the oil from being warmed
&gt;in the filter.


Big warning on header wrap.  Header wrap has been abandoned by the racecar
drivers because it destroys headers.  The wrap can cause the headers to
approach near molten temperatures and they just don't last when they are that
hot.   FOr racecar drivers wrapped headers would only last one race.  I'm
sure it wouldn't be quite so dramatic on an aircooled vw but it could
significantly reduce the life of your
exhaust.  wrapping heater boxes is another story as the air flowing over the
exhaust pipe inside the box keeps the pipes cool enough.  Maybe fabing a heat
shield to block radiative heat would be a better choice?   i was looking into
wrapping my exhaust for better performance but my research (all from the
watercooled world ) completely discouraged me although i do plan on wrapping
some of the heating components.
good luck hope it all goes together smoothly
