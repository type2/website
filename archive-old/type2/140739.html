Sounds most likely to be your exhaust

If the head of the valve bends, there will be lower
compression and the stem will appear shorter.

 ----------------------------------------------------------------------

I have seen two different versions of 'dropped seats'.

1) where the aluminum surface of the head, where the steel seat sits on, breaks off into the exhaust port and 
the steel seat 'drops' into the port.
This makes the stem longer.

2) the steel seat comes loose in the head and when the valve opens, the seat follows. Sometimes the seat goes 
back in the hole, sometimes it cocks in the hole; holding the valve open. This makes the stem shorter. Until 
you pull the head to inspect, you appear to have a bent valve head. As though the valve kissed a piston and 
bent.

I believe #2 is the scenario happening now. Pull the head now and replace it.
