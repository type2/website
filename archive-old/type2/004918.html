Subject: New VW Heat exchangers
Date: Fri, 13 Apr 2001 15:52:13 +0200
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;


I've just been offered a pair of new heat exchangers for my 1978 2.0 ltr
van. They are genuine VW parts and the list price I am being quoted is 750
DM each, about £250 or $350. Does this sound right? I haven't been able to
find any details for genuine VW parts on the web. Whether they're worth the
extra or not is another matter, I assume genuine VW parts which are not made
anymore will be worth the extra cash?
