&gt;i am hoping someone will be able to help me....i have a 71 camper and the sliding door will not open amymore.  and i'd imagine that i cannot take the handle off/apart if i cannot open the door.  does anyone have any sugestions?  my very reliable mechanic said he would basically have to take the door off/apart to get to the root of the problem.  and if there is any other way i would appreciate it.
