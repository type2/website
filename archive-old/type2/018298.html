Subject: An enourmous thank you! ...and those damn seals
Message-ID: &lt;3754A82E.FC42DD3D_at_mail.ripon.k12.wi_dot_us&gt;

First off...I lost your email adress so I am thanking you publicly... I
got home today and there was a padded envelope adressed to me from Karl
von Salzen!  It was the cap and tube for the water tank/sink setup!!
Thanks Karl!!  I owe you one!
A very present suprise after coming home from hours of exams!

I payed off my bus tonight (an hour ago) so it is now officially mine!!!
I will be putting a battery in her and a new muffler on her Saturday
morning then driving her home!! WOO HOO!!!
Stella (the 71 hardtop westy) is now mine!

And one more thing about those horrific seals.....  I am a broke student
once again..  but I DO need a cargo hatch seal for her.  It split in
half...and half of it fell off so there is a 4&quot;deep puddle of water in
my spare tire well every time it rains....which it is doing right now...
and water under my matresses for my bed.... I take a trip of 40 miles
(round trip) every time it rains to dry her out.... I really would like
this seal...but don't have $130 to blow on a piece of rubber....are
there any alternatives that will better my situation...or anyone with an
extra one?? or anyone that got cut that I can still use??  Ron?? Do you
have any defects that you would get rid of cheap?

Well...sorry to jabber soo much but...you know how it is when you
....yes YOU first got your first bus...
yes...it is the first in a long series I'm sure.... my next goal is a
barndoor...or crew cab....old...but lets not count our chickens before
they hatch...

Thanks a lot!
Isaiah
