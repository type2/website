Subject: Re: [T2]  VWoA Still screwing with people

Silverman &amp; Associates won a $14,000 settlement for me over the nearly
thirty warranty service appointments made due to quality defects in my
Touareg.

Seems to me they have a lot of nerve wasting money on lawyers -- either to
protect &quot;IP&quot; or defend pissed-off owners because they sell garbage at top
dollar.

So true.

It's too bad when VW clearly has more important things to worry about:
