Subject: Aftermarket sunroof

Does anyone have experience with any of the
aftermarket ragtop sunroof products? I'm considering
putting one into my '71 Bus. The only one I've seen,
from Street Beat out in Arizona, concerns me, since a
buddy of mine put one of their rags in his bug, and it
sags. I can only imagine that a bus rag would sag even
more, considering the much larger surface area.
