Dear Type 2 listees....


Its time I take my leave of this list. My son and I restored/rebuilt a 78
Champagne Edition Bus this past year. We figured it would make a great car
for him to go to college with. While he was home for Thanksgiving vacation,
a fuel line popped on the engine, the engine caught fire...and the bus was
toast.

We replaced the 78 with an 84 Vanagon GL (got to keep things in the VW
family). Thanks for all the help/advice, etc. from all of you. 

I'll still be on the EuroVan, Vanagon, Vintage lists...so for some of us,
our paths will still cross from time to time.
