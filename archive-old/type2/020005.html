&gt; Tim,

&gt; Do you know if they had to change major parts like the
&gt; compressor in the R134A changeover?

They used a new stock compressor in mine.

Just a theory, could the differing chemical makeup of the two refridgerents
act negatively upon seals conditioned to function under the first fluid
installed?

This is what happened with California's change in the chemical compound of
our diesel fuel.  Most diesels, trucks, and cars, developed leaks requiring
rebuild of most of the components.  Soft parts, seals and o-rings.  Due to
the compounds used in the fuel injection seals and o-rings of my 78, 83, and
85 diesel sedans, the change in fuel had no negative effects.

When a seal, or o-ring is in contact with a particular set of chemicals, it
may expand or shrink slightly.  My understanding of the diesel situation is
that the early fuel caused the seals and o-rings to expand and the later fuel
caused them to shrink and leak.

This may explain why some leak and others don't, I hope.

Mike D.
