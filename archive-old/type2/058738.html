Subject: Head!

All, well I scrounged up a used head from a local for (sigh) $50.  He
guarantees it is good and it looks like she'll go so we shall see...  Wish
me luck.

Upon further inspection the dropped seat head was rebuilt with a stamp of a
lower case t in a triangle.  If anyone knows what that one is I am
curious...  No idea of how long it lasted due to it being from the PO with
uncertain history.

Thanks to all for the advice and generous help offers, it really means a lot.
