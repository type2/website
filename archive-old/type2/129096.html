Subject: Free Pop-top for bus karma

I have a 1970 Pop-top and luggage rack that I just removed from my bus.  
I got my new high top for free, so it's only right that I offer my old 
top for free.  The fiberglass is in good shape.  The luggage rack is ok, 
the bars are rusty, but they're pretty solid, except for two of them 
that need to be bolted back on.  The canvas is unfortuately NFG.  You 
might be able to make a pattern out of it though.  That's up to you. 

You have to pick it up in Valencia, CA.  The zip is 91355.  I can only 
store this thing for so long before people start getting angry about it 
existing.  After May 16th, I will not be able to store it, as I will be 
living out of my van for a few weeks before driving across the country 
to my home in Buffalo.  I wish I could say I could take it on my trip 
and drop it off somewhere, but that's really not an option. 

Email me or call 716-930-2064 for more info...
