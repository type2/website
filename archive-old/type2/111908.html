Subject: hard starting in the morning, i think its because its cold,
  what should i check?

i could'nt start my bus this morning. '70 bus stock
pict. carb. The (idle bypass?) has been cut off, it
was'nt working and its like $40 to replace so I just
cut it for the time being..

it got cold last night for the first time, and this
morning I tried starting my bus and it would'nt
start.. Could this be the thing i cut off, or the
choke or something?

This afternoon as im color sanding, i decided to give
it a try, vroom after some effort, though it sounded
rough, then it warmed up after a couple minutes and
ran like a champ..

started right up everytime after that..What gives??
