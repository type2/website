Subject: Re: [T2] Samba Effect  /RANT/

You guys can rant and rave all you want about prices and bluebook.
Wait until you wreck both of your type 2s in less than a month. Then your
stuck without a vehicle and without a work vehicle.
REMEMBER the book value is a replacement value. When I wrecked my 70 deluxe
with ugly paint the low value was $3000-3500. was that value wrong??? Of
course, I had almost $4500 in the damn thing. I was offered $1500 for it , I
got $2200 . I live on the east coast , in Charlotte NC, I looked for 2
months and couldn't find a similar bus that was as solid as mine.
What I wanted was a similar bus and the $ to cover my time getting another ,
fixing what was wrong and getting it on the road. I needed to recouped for
my inconvenience.
So some of you have never paid more than $1500 - $2000 for a bus, so what.
What bearing does that have on the vale of a type 2 ??
I paid $600 for my 75 westy I have now. It a no rust , original interior
camper with a new acrylic top , OG tent and ugly primer paint. It would take
$5000 to pry the title out of my hands. Is it worth it?? I don't care, it
would cost me $5000 to buy a crappy one and have all the lowers welded in to
resemble factory and locate an original interior and have a good motor.,
Still not worth it you say? Good, its not for sale, Find me another one.
Everyone sees busses for sale cheap , well that's fine. If I see a bus for
sale in Texas for $1000 ,I have to rent a truck and dolly and go get it. I
have a 64 kombi waiting for me in Austin. Lets see. 2 day there. 1 day to
load the bus on the dolly and make sure all is right , 2 days back. My 5
days are worth $700, a truck will cost at least $600. I have to fork out
$1300. so then I have $2300 in a $1000 bus, then I have to fix it and make
it reliable. Or I have $1300 in the 64 that needs everything .
The Samba rocks . Without it or something like it many of us would be SOL.
Of course their are going to be over priced cars on there. That happens any
where.
Bottom line is that if you find a $800 bus for $8000 , don't buy it.
