Subject: '76 Westy for parts $250 - HURRY!!

STEAL THIS BUS!

I need to get rid of this vehicle fast, or else I will have to strip it
myself, which I don't have time to do.  I'll give someone an absolute steal
on it IF you strip it or tow it away immediately.  Located near
Philadelphia/Reading Pa.

'76 green full deluxe Westfalia with sink, stove, poptop, fridge, etc.  Four
nearly new sidewall-reinforced tires that cost the previous owner $250 (the
tires alone are worth the asking price of the whole bus!).  Good 4-speed
trans, good axle beam, front seat swivel, louvered windows, etc.  No engine.

$250 firm.  You strip it or tow it by Tuesday (preferably sooner).  If
you're even remotely nearby, don't pass this up.  There are tons of good
parts on this bus.  If I had the room I wouldn't be selling it this cheap.
(Heck, I could sell the plaid fabric mattress covers alone for $100!)  I
will consider offers from people who only want certain parts, but YOU must
come and remove them yourself by Tuesday.
