&gt; i am looking to do redo the cargo area of my 78

&gt; wondering if anyone out there has a measured drawing

&gt; have done.   i am really just looking for some
&gt; ideas.  

Give us a &quot;scenario&quot; - What is it you're planning to
do with it? Do the seats need only function for
socializing when parked or do they need to be
road-worthy safe? Is it a camper and needs a
convertible bed? What's the functionality?

I went for years without cabinets and then decided two
days before a long camping trip that I needed to build
something, even if it was wrong - as a starting point
to see what to change and make it &quot;right.&quot; I make
signs for a living, so I cut up old &quot;Proposed Landuse&quot;
signs to build them. Using wood has made it a bit
heavy. I did learn what I think will work for me. I
also did studies of camper layouts in wrecking yard. 

Future holds spiffy aluminum extrusions for framing
with lightweight composite materials for paneling. The
&quot;nice&quot; wood articles I have in the bus require more
maintenance to keep looking good than I care to spend!
I have some photos but really they're bed-oriented. -BaH
