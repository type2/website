&gt; I'd like to extend an invitation to you one and all to
&gt; come and participate in a new website dedicated to
&gt; building an international VW community on the web.
&gt; 
&gt; We just opened the site on 12 April, 1999.
&gt; 
&gt; It's a members only site - BUT - membership is free!
&gt; 
 
&gt; Come by and see us at http://www.bluebus_dot_org/
&gt; 

I appreciate your attempt to produce a site for all of us, but am having
difficulty finding your privacy statement on your &quot;public&quot; side.  Have I
just missed it, or is it truly not in evidence?  Unless I know what use
may be made of the information I provide (including name, address, VW's
I own, etc.), I am very reluctant to start sending this info to any
&quot;membership&quot; registry.

Can you provide, either on your site or to this list, a statement of
what use will be made of the information you are requesting?
