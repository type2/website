Subject: High crankcase pressure problem after installing new carbs -
  dangling hose from breather box!?

Hi there,

here is a weird problem - I thought I was doing our 1972 1.7l Westy a  
favor when I purchased an EMPI DUAL 40mm BROSAL (SOLEX) CARBURETOR  
KIT to replace the aging original Solex carburators.

One challenge I had after the installation was what do with the hose  
from the breather box as that connected to the airbox in the stock  
setup, which would no longer exist after the upgrade. Had asked  
around and learned that people vented to the outside so I initially  
kinked the hose slightly to limit any oil vapors should they occur.

After starting up the engine and returning from a test drive I  
noticed oil leaking from the main seal, oil sitting around the  
breather box and my dipstick was raised -&gt; extremely high crankcase  
pressure :-/

The engine was rebuilt approx. 30K miles ago and any flow-by  
shouldn't be a problem - although I haven't done a compression test yet.

Any ideas on how to troubleshoot this problem that happened only  
after the new carbs were installed are extremely welcome!

What are others doing with their hose from the breather box? Should  
that be reconnected anywhere? Could that be the problem for my high  
crankcase pressure, i.e. that I somehow disrupted proper venting!?

Thanks, Harry.
