&gt; I don't think any production VW bus ever came with a limited-slip
&gt; differential... so that means if any one of your four CV joints breaks, your
&gt; bus does not go.

if it is a dire emergency and you do have to move it one way is to &quot;Lock&quot;
the broken side,  a bar bolted to the hub of the tranny where the CV
would normally bolt on, and then secured to the frame of the bus.  then
drive VERY VERY Gently  but you can get it out of the way or to a safer
place that way

&gt; Possibly someone on the List can advise if your shafts are of equal lengths.

axle shaft length
manual  476mm (18 3/4 inches) both sides
auto tranny
left side  457mm  (18in)
right side 505mm  (19 7/8 inches)

the shafts for the auto tranny have a ridge in the middle of the shaft,
the manual shafts are smooth
