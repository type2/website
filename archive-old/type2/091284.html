&gt; Why would anyone &quot;She left Oregon with an &quot;iffy&quot; alternator, &quot; for a 2000

Reminds me of &quot;Blue Highways&quot; where the fellow set out on a lap around
America with a noisy water pump bearing on his Ford.  He made it about 3/4
of the way around.

In that vein, I have set out with my bus in less than 100% shape, but I
make sure that I have the spares needed to fix the problem.
