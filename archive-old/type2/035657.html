Prospective Type 2 buyers.
After reading my mail re the $1500 Vanagon Westy and the $1000
Vasserboxer Westy, i realise that I neglected to mention that I have a
pretty complete shop and can do virtually all mechanical work myself so
the bargains above would not exist for anyone not able to DIY.
Nevertheless, non runners can be bought cheap and put on the road
inexpensively.
Such is the demand for Westys that I cleared 2K when I sold the 84
Vasserboxer.
Money spent on DIY equipment is well worth it.
Good Luck, Jack Handy
