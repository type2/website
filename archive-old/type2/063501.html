&gt; 
&gt; So for the uninitiated, just what are these, and where are they
&gt; installed? 

On a normal 55-67 bus, there is a replacement plate for the airbox
cover thathas 2 small fans in it.

In a barndoor, there is a special scoop thats mounted on the front
section of the roof, with a hole having to be cut in the metal,
and 2 small fans are put in there.  Can't remember where the 
switch goes.
