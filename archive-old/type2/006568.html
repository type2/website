On the way home from work tonight, I had to use the wipers. They made one
hell of a racket, when switched on! They were labouring &amp; straining badly.
Last time I used the wipers, they worked fine (albeit slowly!) I have a 75
Bus.
Any solutions?
(I drove home in the rain &amp; left the wipers off!)
