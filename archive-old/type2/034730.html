Subject: Starter Failures on Engine Test Stand - Need Advice

	I have experience two starter failures while attempting to complete
my engine test stand.  

	The first failure blew sparks out the geared end of the starter when
I applied 12V to the spade terminal # 50 (supplied via a momentary starter
switch).  Prior to the failure I ensured that I had 12 V at terminal # 30
and 0 V at terminal # 50.  Upon pressing the starter switch I got 12 V at
the spade connector.  No problem right?  When all wired up I press the
starter switch and sparks for a fraction of a second then nothing, it never
did turn.  I tried the screwdriver techniques, nothing.  OK, Bad starter.

	So I pondered, relooked at the Bentley diagram, wiring seems OK.  I
try my other starter.  It blew sparks, same as before.  What am I doing
wrong?  Is it coincidence that two starters failed the same way or is there
a problem with my wiring?

	FWIW, the test stand consists of an old transaxle case mounted to a
wheeled dolly, the negative battery terminal is connected to a transaxel
bolt, the positive is connected to terminal # 30 and a #12 awg is used for
the on/off toggle (that also powers the idiot lights for pressure and
generator - they work), then the momentary starter switch to terminal # 50.
Both starters are/were the 12 V variety.  Battery cables are #2 awg and
approximately 2' long.

Thanks from a humbled electrical engineer.
