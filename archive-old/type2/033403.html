Subject: My last thght wood flr

This morning I ran  out into Blue in the rain to warm him up then ran back
inside. Being a cable &quot;technician&quot; in Chicago we have had our work trucks
broken into as of late and are advised to take our tools home. I bring half
the load into Blue when I warm him up, the other half when Im ready to go.
Needless to say when I jump in the PILOTS SEAT I throw my tool belt in
between the two seats with a crash. Alot of undescribable metal specialty
tools hang from the bottom of this and nash all over the Pergo-esque wood I
have inbetween these two seats. for the few weeks Ive had this wood
inbetween I hvnt scratched them yet. Im sure I will, I dont fear it, but not
yet. Good stuff. I know the previous post had more to do with existing Oak
wood that was laying around and got a little side tracked. I would be a
little against natural wood for a utility like this. I wouldnt want to have
to baby the interior. I need function first. Also the $150 molding kit for
pergo.. I hvnt seen. I purchased 1 $5 strip of molding and it gives enough
pressure on my floating 4x5 floor. Cheap, looks good, lasts long. Pics
posted when I have time.
    HAVE A GREAT DAY ALL!!!!
