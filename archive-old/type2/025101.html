Hi all! 

Just wanted to post a note saying I am in Heildelberg, Germany. I know there 
is someone on the list who lives here. 

I have not seen many (like two) bay window buses, and none older than that. A 
few bugs and one beautiful ghia convertible. So far, not much more than is in 
my driveway!

That's about all.

Anyone going to the Bug-Out in Manassas, Virginia this year? I will be home 
by then and plan on going. Hope to see some of you there.
