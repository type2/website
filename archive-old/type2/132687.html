X-ACNS-MailScanner: Found to be clean
Subject: Re: Upright engine install

Zach, I've had the same problem.  I think what happens is that when the 
engine weight comes off the springs, the body rises -- but if your 
tranny is sitting on a bottle jack or something it hasn't moved 
relative to the ground, but the body has moved higher.  I've found that 
I sometimes have to raise or lower the tranny to get things to line up. 
  Sometimes everything's copacetic and it slides right in with hardly a 
fuss, and other times I'm back and forth a lot, tweaking the angle.  
Get the engine where you think it needs to be and see if you can raise 
the rear end of the tranny enough to get things aligned.  There's lots 
of flex room.  Helps a lot to have one person wiggling the engine 
around and another person eyeballing the tranny/engine matchup.

Good luck!

&gt; From: &quot;Zach Freshman&quot; &lt;zachary_at_freshmans_dot_com&gt;
&gt; I'm trying to get my 1776 back into my 1970 Westy. It seems like when I
&gt; get the support bar on the rear end( the bus's, not mine) high enough 
&gt; to
&gt; clear the mounts, the front is way too high. Right now my tranny is
&gt; still at the same height as when I removed the engine. Should I 
&gt; adjust??
&gt; Any tips from the list gurus would help
