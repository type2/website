I've just finished an overhaul of my 1980 VW vanagon 1800cc engine. When
I try ty mount the distributor, the engine seems to push it outwards. I
couldn't find the reason why, so I consulted several mechanics, the
Bentley, and finally decided to mount the engine as it was, tightening
the distributor mounting screws as best as possible. There were a slight
click sound as the distributor shaft was pushing upwards.

When I started the engine, it didn't have any problem. I've been driving
it for several days without a problem.

Is this normal? What are your experiences with this?

Thanks.
