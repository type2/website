Subject: Re: [T2] chopped bus, no title, HELP ME!!!

&gt;Well, Matty, i used to have a couch that i did not want. so, i used a
&gt;chainsaw and threw away a chunk each week with regular garbage delivery. it
&gt;took several months, your bus could take a year, but why not practice your
&gt;cutting and grinding techniques?

I did this with a motorcycle, putting a part or two per night (whenever I 
thought of it) into a 7-11 dumpster and a restaurant dumpster. Didn't take a 
very long time, and I didn't pay a thing to haul it away.

The other option discussed was a big ramp to drop it into the dumpster 
whole, but that might be even less practical for a full-size bus carcass.
