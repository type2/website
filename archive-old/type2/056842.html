Subject: Have I screwed up this head?

 Hi all:

 While removing the nuts holding the rocker assembly to the aircooled
 head I was working on, one of the studs started to back out.  After I
 got the rocker assembly off I was able to back the stud completely
 out of the head by hand.

 Since I've never had great luck replacing studs using the &quot;double
 nut&quot; technique (it seems like the nuts start to turn on the stud
 before the stud is fully seated) I decided I'd &quot;chase&quot; the threads in
 the head with the appropriate tap.

 Turning in the tap took considerably more effort than I would have
 expected (the threads in the head *looked* fine) but now the stud
 turns in easily by hand.  In fact, the stud now &quot;rocks&quot; very slightly
 when it's at the correct depth.

 So, are the holes in these heads tapped using some kind of special
 tap (tapered?, 100% taps?), and do you think something like 271
 Loctite will save the day?  Or have I screwed up this head?

 TIA.
