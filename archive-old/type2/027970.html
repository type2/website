Subject: Locking up the engine and such

	About a month back, I lost an oil gallery plug en route somewhere. I pulled
over, took a slow month fixing it, and tried to fire things up today. I
think my battery's dead, but am suddenly faced with a new concern.

	I can't turn the engine by hand. It's stuck fast. I pulled over very
quickly when the plug blew and the engine was still running smoothly when I
did. Should I be able to turn the engine by hand at this point, or am I
doomed?

	A little scared,

	Ian
