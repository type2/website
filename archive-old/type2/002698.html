The Bus Depot, a leading mail order distributor of VW parts located in
eastern Pa., has immediate openings for full or part time employees.  This
is a great opportunity for a VW enthusiast who would like to make his or her
hobby a full-time thing.  If you are not personally interested, but know of
somebody who might be, please pass this message on.

Initially you will be doing mostly packing, shipping and receiving, but
after you have learned the ropes you will be dealing directly with
customers, recommending parts and taking orders, and handling customer
service issues.  Full time hours (at this time) are weekdays, roughly 11-7,
with weekends off.  Starting pay will about $9-$12 an hour, depending on
qualifications and ability; no &quot;benefits&quot; but you do get all the parts you
need for your bus at wholesale.

It's a fun job in my opinion, but I'll warn you, it can also be very
frenzied, with the phone ringing off the hook and orders going out as fast
as the merchandise comes in.  90% of our business is mail-order, and things
never slow down from the minute we open 'til the minute we close.  You need
to be able to handle a very fast-paced, non-stop atmosphere without pulling
your hair out, or you won't like this job.  I rely heavily on my employees
and need someone who is responsible, motivated, energetic, intelligent, and
in this for the long haul.  The Bus Depot is growing in leaps and bounds, so
there is plenty of potential in the long term for the right person.

We are located in Montgomery County, Pennsylvania (about 1/2 hour from
Allentown or Pottstown, 40 minutes from King of Prussia or Reading, an hour
from Philadelphia).  Interested individuals should email me directly at
busdepot_at_email_dot_com.
