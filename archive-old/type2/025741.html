&gt; someone who doesn't know all that much about electricity
&gt; it seems like a good idea to me.
&gt; 
&gt; What I was thinking is this :
&gt; 
&gt; &quot;I wonder if I could hookup a power inverter to this plug in thing and
&gt; connect that to a second battery?&quot;
&gt; 
&gt; Am I missing something pretty obvious that would make this not work?

 One detail:

Make sure you completly re-wire things so that the outside connector with
its male pins does *not* have line voltage on it when you use the UPS
