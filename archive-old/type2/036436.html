Subject: proper torque for 1600DP intake manifold studs?

Hi folks--

I want to check whether my intake manifold has a leak 
at the heads after 6 months of break-in.  Does anyone 
know what the proper torque for those nuts would be?  
I've been through my library of too-many-manuals, but 
can't find a number.

thanks
