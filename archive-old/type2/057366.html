Subject: Bob Hoover

An open letter to Mr Shawn Zenor,

I read your insightful take on Mr. Hoover via the list and now note the
result of ego-driven agendas like yours . Way to go. }:-(

Bob is one of those guys that are found so seldom these days, a
mechanic, tinkerer,iconoclast and poet. Bob is heavy on what is called'
life experience' , a commodity lacking in these days of nerds,geeks and
'engineers' who write code but can't read a micrometer. If I were on the
road to the Artic circle or the Baja peninsula I sure as hell know who
I'd want along.

I am dismayed that the T2 list is deteriorating into the same trap as
much of the usenet/list community: the proliferation of
*instant experts and juvy gurus*who make thier flame points at the
expense of the rest of us. The profile seems to ring true regardless of
the subject, tactless and rude personal attacks rather than real
discussion. Pointless diatribe in place of  real knowlege. I hate to see
a resource like Bob`s Sermons go down, and if Mr. Zenor is what we have
to replace them with ,God help us.

    *You wouldn`t know a diamond if you held it in your hand*
                                                    -steely dan
