Subject: Re: Cleaning caked engine parts

does anybody remember about a month ago
some camping/ swap meet on this list where
they lit a mag case and watched it burn ?

BTW, i clean parts with kerosene, even while installed .
just hose off and go...and &quot;gunk&quot;spray engine cleaner is
good for a fast soapy/petroleum mix, too....
