Friday afternoon I paid $1.32.9/gallon for unleaded regular in Tacoma, WA.
this was at COSTCO's pumps.  Majors down the street were getting
$1.34.9/gallon.

&gt;&gt;  today I was pleasently supprised to find that regular gas has dropped to
$1.50 a gallon, last week it was $1.69 at the same location. Does anybody
else see this trend in falling fuel prices. If they keep dropping I might
make even more long distance road trips to VW shows.  &lt;&lt;
