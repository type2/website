Subject: Re: [T2] Asbestos

My guess is that VWoA replaced the asbestos-containing components on a
few buses so that they could demonstrate later in asbestos liability
lawsuits that they had tried to do something about the problem. When
pressed, the VWoA mechanic conceded, off the record, that, yes, it did
have something to do with asbestos.

I think the VW legal department had hoped most of these old buses
would eventually rust away or otherwise end up in the junkyard. With
prices for old VW buses going through the roof, though, it looks like
more folks will be hanging onto them, or buying old ones and fixing
them up.

&gt; &gt; Hiya RD,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; So..............is VoA still running this program?  Or was it
&quot;this is your
&gt; &gt; one and only chance&quot; kinda thing?
&gt;
&gt; No, it was probably run so that VWoA could gather evidence that they
&gt; weren't poisoning the general populace with asbestos.  Now that they
have
&gt; all the old parts they need it is over.  No problem for you, though
as '70
&gt; heat exchangers don't have asbestos and that was the part being
replaced.
