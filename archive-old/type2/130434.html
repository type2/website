Hi Michael,

Just clean both sides of the contact area ( body and strap) with a wire 
brush and reconnect them. A coating of dielectric grease on top of that 
will help put off further corrosion.

My own answer to this eternal question was to install a new secondary 
ground cable from the battery to the fan shroud. For the $8 it cost, it 
was a 10 minute install.

Happy trails,

&gt; Thanks Greg! I will check it out as soon as I get some me 
&gt; time(Cheating Husband). The ground strap is very clean at the battery 
&gt; and the ring at the other end is very clean. I did not clean the 
&gt; contact where the strap bolts to the body. I guess I should do that. 
&gt; Is there a way to test the strap to see if it is not making a good 
&gt; contact?
