Subject: Re: [T2] manual choke cable ?

The only choke cable listed for the splittie is 111 711 501 A (it also fits
Bug thru 1960), length is 148 7/16&quot;.  The knobbed end fits below the front
seat on the seat pedestal.  Dunno if it would be long enough.

The Karmann Ghia cable (141-711-501) is longer at 161 7/32&quot; - longer because
of the way it is routed.  A bit harder to find these days as the application
(56-60) is so narrow.

&gt;        I've always hated automatic chokes, and want to convert my
&gt; '73 Bay to manual.  Has anyone done this before?  An obvious source
&gt; for the cable might seem a scrapped Splittie  -  but is that cable
&gt; long enough?
&gt;        Alternatively, has anyone tried abolishing the choke
&gt; altogether?  The climate in N. New Zealand is similar to N. Calif; on
&gt; the coldest mornings, can one simply blip the accelerator to shove in
&gt; a couple squirts from the accelerator pump, and start OK without any
&gt; choke?  And if that works, is there point in removing the choke shaft
&gt; &amp; plate to allow slightly freer breathing?
