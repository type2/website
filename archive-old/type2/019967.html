Subject: Broken MC Brake Fluid Reservoir

Hello all!

I've returned to the list after many months away (working on an MA
degree) to ask for help in finding a brake fluid reservoir (positioned
on top of the MC) for my 77 bus.

I was trying to remove the old one from the dying MC so I could install
it to the new MC when I did a fine job of breaking one of the nipples
off of it.  I tried every junk yard I could think of here in Hawaii with
no success.  Then I called California Imports &amp; they told me they don't
carry them and they don't know anyone who makes them.  Next to the Bus
Depot &amp; they said they had to order one but that I should get it in a
week or so.  To make a long story a little longer (sorry) after a weeks
wait I called back to find that the part was on &quot;backorder&quot; and they
didn't know when it would come in.  They told me, however, that they had
found one laying around in the shop and that it might fit.  I was
anxious so I told them to send it to me.  It arrived today and the
nipples are way too far apart!!  I'll call them tomorrow to return it
but I'm starting wonder about obtaining one of these.  I saw something
on the archives that said these are no longer made!!??  Does anyone have
any advice/suggestions or one laying around that they would like to
sell??

P.S. A mildly interesting bit of information - The part I received had
two very old looking tags fastened to it that had what appeared to be
Portuguese written on them
