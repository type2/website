Subject: Re: [T2] noisy hydraulic lifter cure

&gt; &gt; Anyway, one thing that the shop did while the

&gt; to help the valve

&gt; shop owner sees tons of
&gt; Vanagons and the lifters consistently have
&gt; trouble pumping up after
&gt; sitting around for a few days and leaking down.
&gt;  He claims this product
&gt; is the one thing that really helps the problem.
&gt;  And I'll be d*mned...

Now idea what this product is, but I'd like to
pass along an experience.  

I had a 1.9 vanagon with lifter clatter.  I used
varoius things to flush the engine, such as MOM,
atf, along with detergent additives (CD2?), and
very, very frequent oil changes to keep the
symptoms to a minimum.  But the clatter was
always there if my bus sat a day or two.  

Then I switched to straight weight oil, 40W in
the summer and 30W in the winter, and the clatter
went away.  (Check your owners manual for the
temp ranges for those oils-- I don't trust my
memory and neither should you.)  Then, my vanagon
could sit for weeks without the lifters
collapsing and that horrible racket on start up. 


If you running 5W or 10W oil and having lifter
symptoms, I'd begin with putting heavier oil in
your bus.  (Actually, I'd put heavier oil in any
aircooled engine, but that another thread
entirely....)
