Subject: Re: [T2] Brake Questions: Bus pulls down in front.

I have done much brake work on my '72.  There is a big difference between a
working and not working brake booster.  With everything working properly, I
feel very confident about the braking in my bus.  I can stop with my toes.

I cannot speak about your nose diving.  Maybe your rear brakes are not
working at all now.

I found the best way to adjust the rear brakes are as follows:

Back the adjuster screws all the way in.  Adjust them out the same amount.
Count the clicks.  10 this one.  10 that one, 5 this one, 5 that one, and so
on until you are completely tight.  Then, loosen up 2 clicks on each one.
Then go do the other side.  If you are going to bleed the brakes, bleed them
before the final loosening.

If your booster is leaking, you are likely also having engine troubles do to
the mix being too lean from the vacuum leak.  Have you noticed any problems
there such as backfiring, poor idle?

If you need to rebuild your booster, I recommend H&amp;R in Dallas.  My rebuild
job cost me $81, including shipping and only took 4 days using US parcel
post for shipping from Virginia.

&gt; Hey Volks,
&gt; Thanks to all those who replied about partly camperizing my bus.  I got
&gt; some really great info.  Some of the replies saved me some time trying
&gt; different things, and some money in buying things to try that I would most
&gt; likely not be satisfied with.  Anyway, on to the question:
&gt; I was having some brake trouble last week.  When I hit the brakes it
&gt; felt like there was no brake booster, like I was doing all the work myself.
&gt; Now, I have nothing to compare the brake feeling with since I have never
&gt; driven another bus, but it seemed not right to me.  I went under the bus and
&gt; replaced the little plastic or hard rubber piece that goes form the metal
&gt; vacuum tube to the brake booster, it looked rough.  For this I used a high
&gt; quality rubber line from the FLAPS, is that cool?  This did nothing for or
&gt; against me at all.
&gt; I adjusted the rear brakes according to Bentley, checked the shoes and
&gt; the pads up front, and took it for another spin.  This time things seemed a
&gt; bit improved.  I still would not exactly feel comfortable in a panic stop
&gt; (might have to dry off the seat afterwards in fact), but things are better.
&gt; The only weird thing is that the bus now seems to pull (or push, or just go)
&gt; down in the front when I hit the brakes.  Any ideas why that might happen?
&gt; I am planning to bleed the lines (possibly replace the fluid if I feel
&gt; froggy) tomorrow or this weekend assuming I can get a helper.  Any thing
&gt; else I can check (yes, I checked the fluid level first thing)?  I want to
&gt; check the brake booster, but I don't have a vacuum gauge (I know, I've got
&gt; to get one).
&gt; How well do these big suckers stop?  Should I have to leave a fair
&gt; amount of extra space and plan my red light stopping well in advance?  I am
&gt; not opposed to this, just would like to know.
