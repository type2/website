Subject: Re: [T2] Is there such a thing as a flat clearcoat?

From: &quot;Terry K.&quot; &lt;CTONLINE_at_webtv_dot_net&gt;
&gt; But the Testor's dull coat by the model builder's club would wash off the
tank the first time ole Courtney missed the filler hole with the gas--enamel
and bike tanks don't mix well...

Lustercoat makes a clear spray paint for R/C aircraft that is fuelproof, but
I don't know if it's matte or gloss finish.  Most hobby stores carry it.
