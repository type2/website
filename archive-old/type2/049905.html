Jim Arnott sends:

&gt; You got yerself a case of dirty terminals.  Go get a battery terminal
&gt; cleaning brush (about $1.99 at your local FLAPS) and clean everything
&gt; up.  Put a good coat of vaseline on the posts and hook it all back up.
&gt; That should cure your problem...

Also get some of those felt washers you'll see two pegs down from the
battery brush, and put those on before you put on the posts. These
neutralize battery acid leaking up around the posts, and will help keep the
problem from coming back.
