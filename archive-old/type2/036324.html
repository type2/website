Subject: bn4 not igniting

Greetings..

I am having a problem with my later model BN4 heater.  The fuel pump whirrs
away, the fan blows, and everything works as it should, except I don't get
any heat.  I've read Ron VN's article (excellent by the way) on the website,
but I'd like to know how to diagnose whether the problem lies in the spark
plug or the glow plug.  The heater is in excellent shape, with all wires
intact, no corrosion on electrical connections, etc.  So how can I tell
what's keeping the heater from igniting and producing that wonderful heat
that it produced last winter?

As the spark plug/glow plugs are pricey, I'd like to know which one to buy,
if possible.  Also, does anyone know who sells these parts for this heater?

Any help would be appreciated.

Cheers,
