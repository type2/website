Subject: 69 vs 70 Westy parts swap?

After researching various places for some parts I'll need for the '69 
hardtop Westy, I've run across a nicely-running 70 Westy pop-top for an 
amazingly low price (motivated seller). Before I even go to look at it, I 
want to make sure the parts I'm thinking of taking from this '70 will go 
into the 69. I know the years are similar. Here's what I want:

Engine (1600 DP)
tranny
front end w/steering box
bumpers
decklid and apron
side tent

I think that's about it.
Any compatibility issues?
Thanks,
Jason
