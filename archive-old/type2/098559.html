The problem is that sometimes you run into something really 
cool on ebay. Maybe it is a Jalousie window for a Vanagon, or 
a sliding rear window, a shortened van, vw monster truck, or 
whatever. Something that other listee might very well like to 
see, and certainly van related.

The Vanagon list does not police eBay auctions, and things 
have not spiralled out of control. At most I may see one a 
day, and since I generally get a hundered or so e-mails off 
of the Vanagon list that is a pretty small percentage.

I understand the need to keep spam off the list but honestly 
type2 takes itself WAY to seriously. As a side note I think 
it is silly to have to add the [...] when I want to 
substantially quote content. Most of us have moved up from 
our 14.4 modems.

Thanks,
Chris

&gt;
&gt;I'd like to weigh in on this issue again. I posted a note 
last week 
&gt;suggesting that a 3rd list not be formed, since type2_dot_com 
alreadys maintains 
&gt;a classified section. Not to be overly cynical, but it seems 
like 
&gt;unnecessary duplication of information.
&gt;
&gt;I like the intiative taken to poll the listees.  The results 
indicate that 
&gt;it's not a simple yes/no question but an issue with many 
facets. Only let 
&gt;sellers post, only allow 2 posts per item, tag them with a 
header.....what 
&gt;happens if people start replying, to the list, about these 
items? To me, 
&gt;it's unnecessary complication to come up with a bunch of new 
rules 
&gt;specifically for e-bay classified ads.
&gt;
&gt;And to address the issue of &quot;how come vendors and not me&quot; - 
here's my 
&gt;thought: Ron Salmon sells parts day in and day out, but he 
doesn't post his 
&gt;entire catalog on the list every day. Maybe once in a while 
we get postings 
&gt;about new parts. He doesn't spam the list every day with 
postings. But if 
&gt;everyone posting an e-bay item decides to send a note to the 
list, you're 
&gt;going to have a lot of clutter.
&gt;
&gt;If you want classifieds, check the type2 classifieds. If you 
want e-bay, you 
&gt;can 1. go to  e-bay. 2. go to samba_dot_com. Though I haven't 
tried it, you can 
&gt;search e-bay listings over there.
&gt;I'd personally rather see the list stick to more 
technical/restoration 
&gt;dicsussions, and keep the classifieds out.
&gt;
&gt;If some people think the vendor discussions are too 
consuming, then write a 
&gt;note and ask admin if they would tighten up on those threads.
&gt;
&gt;Thanks
&gt;Mat
