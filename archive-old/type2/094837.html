Subject: VWoA Exploitation Protection Fund

     I'll be the first to admit I am *horrible* with money, so not me.  I 
was thinking though (this is dangerous) that maybe we could put our 
collective money, where our collective mouth is.  If somebody brave who has 
the knowledge to do such a thing could start accepting donations for a fund 
to help pay the legal fees of those private citizens that are being 
exploited by VWoA's lawyers, I would donate.  I was wondering who else would 
be willing to donate, and since I *truly* have no clue, how hard it would be 
to set up and administer such a fund.  I would guess a board of directors 
would have to be set up, because there probably wouldn't be enough money to 
protect everybody affected (sad, isn't it) and to decide who is least 
capable of protecting themselves and who's situation is truly worthy of 
protection.  Man, it would be an undertaking, but what a statement!  
Unfortunately, I wonder how many of the cases could be fought legally. 
Morally, of course, I believe it's the private citizen who is right but even 
with money it's hard to protect against a company manipulating the intent of 
a law.  Any thoughts on this, I consider it bus related for what I believe 
to be obvious reasons.

Jay Ollom
