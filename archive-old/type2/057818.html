Subject: engine for sale

    Hello all!  I have a 1800cc FI engine that I am willing to part with
if anyone is interested.  Don't know if it will run.  I bought it and a
1700cc as a package and I only need the 1700.  The motor is complete,
not torn down at all.  If interested, I am in Paducah, KY.  P-mail me if
interested.
    Also, I saw a failry decent 73 or 74 Westy for sale here the other
day.  Engine &quot;looked&quot; OK, interior fair, looks like it could use new
canvas.  If you might be interested, drop me a line and I will put you
in touch with the seller.  I would buy it, but my wife says 2 are enough
and threatened to divorce me if it came home!
