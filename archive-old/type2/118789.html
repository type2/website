Subject: Re: [T2] Piston Questions

From: &quot;Richard Atwell&quot; &lt;ratwell_at_mac_dot_com&gt;
&gt; This number is in the repair category and describes a 94mm piston kit for
a 2L. The kit should include:
&gt; 039 101 301C cylinder...

All of that seems to be there, but the rings look like they're already on
the piston and the piston is in the cylinder.  I don't want to pull them
apart as I don't have a ring tool for putting the piston back into the
cylinder.

There's only one &quot;C&quot; locking ring per cylinder, though, not 2.

&gt; If complete I'd say each one was worth about $100...

Cool, thanks.

&gt; That is a Victor Reinz gasket set for a 2L 914. It's worth about $60.

It appears that whoever bought the kit used whatever seals they needed to
install the other cylinders.  Without any experience, I wouldn't know if all
of the bits are there for the remaining cylinders.  Is it worth $60.00 half
there, or complete?

Well, if anyone needs a pair of cylinders for a job, I got the goods. :O)
