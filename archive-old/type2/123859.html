Subject: Re: [T2] Gas mileage

The article I read on the subject was in a consumer reports review of
gasolines several years ago. Unfortunately we moved to a smaller home and I
discarded all my old consumer reports. You may be able to find it in the
readers guide to periodical literature at your local library, or the
consumer reports web site may have it archived, or you may find something
else on the subject with a general web search.

&gt; Where can I find info about this test?
