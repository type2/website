Subject: Re: [T2] childs cot(dumb ?)

I have a fear of that top hammock closing up on me and eating me like a Venus 
Flytrap... must go back to the trauma I experienced when my room-mates on a 
trip closed me up in a murphy bed..... 

It does, however, make another excellent place to stow stuff (along with the 
child's cot) while camped out.
