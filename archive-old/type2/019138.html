Some of you may remember that I was looking for an 031
distributor. Well, once our new mechanic got into the bus, we
found that we didn't have the 010, we were told we had; instead
we have a 050, so we're leaving well enough alone on that count.

What we also had was two cracked heads. One had been installed
without an exhaust stud. The vacuum leak was a cracked hose,
obvious to our new fellow, totally missed by the previous two.
Sigh.

Anyway, right now, the bus is awaiting new heads. New Spanish
heads were ordered, but our mechanic looked them over and said
that they'd never seal properly and he wouldn't build in an
exhaust leak. Back they went. Two sets of Mark Stephens heads
have been ordered and returned, as they were welded in all the
wrong places, including the very ones that made them tell us our
cores were useless. Right now, our mechanic is in search of good
cores planning to rebuild them himself.

Does anybody have any suggestions? Sources of good cores? Better
heads than MS? I mean, I'm glad our mechanic is picky, but I'm
beginning to worry about NEXT camping season, not to mention our
leg on the Bus Relay. Good thing we're at the end.
