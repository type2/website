Depends. If you now have a 34Pict manifold with the adaptor for use of the
30/31, just take off the adaptor and install the 34. If, however, you have
a 30/31 manifold, you will need a 34 manifold to install the new carb. I
haven't heard of an adaptor to convert the 30/31 manifold to the 34 carb.

Others on the list will know more.
