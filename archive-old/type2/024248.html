I imagine they had an owners manula for the 71 westy, not just the bus. If 
so, does anyone out there have one that they would be willing to photocopy? 
I'd gladly pay for the shipping and photocopy charges. I really just want 
more info on all of the hook ups (water storage, elctric hook-ups). 

Anyone, anyone?

Many thanks!
