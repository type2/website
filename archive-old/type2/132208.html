Subject: Re: [T2] Voltage drop on a gas heater, other concerns?

Jay, I have many new parts and a lot of used ones for the SouthWind heaters.
Someone else mentioned it and I would second it, you would be better off
placing your second battery inside the bus (use a battery box) and place
your heater in the engine compartment because those little heaters are a bit
noisey when they running and take up more room than just a battery.

I need to update my site, the prices aren't current and I carry a lot more
parts now than I used to, but you can see some of what I carry here:

&gt; Along the same lines, is it possible and worthwhile to convert 6v gas
&gt; heaters to 12v?  What parts would need to be changed for it to run on 12v?
&gt; I would 
&gt; like to use the other side of the engine compartment for a dual battery set
&gt; up, so I will be placing my gas heater in some other (as yet to be
&gt; determined) non-stock location.  Any suggestions?
