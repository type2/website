&gt; I was told by someone on the list, I think Jay, a while back that
&gt; there is a guy in Waldorf, MD, Joe Cooper, I think his name was, who
&gt; knows a lot about old Veedubs and does some side work. Anyone know how

is he still doing this stuff??

&gt; I can get in touch with him? If not, anyone have any other
&gt; recommendations. The guy I took my bus to to get the vavles adjusted
&gt; didnt adjust my timing and left me with an oil leak, I'm not going
&gt; back to him.

told you to stay away from that guy in Glen Burnie.

off the top of my head I can not think of anyone on the Western Shore,
there is a guy in Wye Mills that is supposedly pretty good and probably
pricy.
other than that there is Desmonds in Baltimore.  and some new folks who
seem to know what their doing up in Edgewood, and of course Peek Auto in
Seabrook, they are the only folks in MD I would trust my bus to and I
doubt I would let Desmond mess with a FI engine. (yours is a 71 right?)

oh yeah and there is a guy in PA just over the MD line from Frostburg I
might consider.  but other than that I can't think of anyone in MD and
since Bruce moved back to Mass I haven't let anyone touch my bus but
me. now there was a guy who knew his VW's and he only worked on buses to
speak of.

at this point I would highly reccomend getting your hands dirty, the 71 is
a real easy engine to work on, maybe the easiest, certainly the easiest to
get in and out of a bus.  I remember mine fondly everytime I pull my
engine....but not enough to give up my 2liter.

Good luck
Bob (in Baltimore)
