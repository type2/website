Subject: Re: [T2] split Handbrake as pseudo diff-lock for off-road use!!!

Speaking as one who has owned a baja with the 'cutting brake' levers
installed I'll add my few comments...

1.) remember that due to the differental action if one brakes one
wheel the opposite will spin at twice speed.

2.) in the really rough going, one usually needs both hands to drive. 
If one had a navigator, possibly it would be of some use.

3.) when you dig a hole with one wheel, the fastest way to get unstuck
is to jack it up and backfill the hole.  With one wheel in a hole and
braked all you're going to do with a 'cutting brake' is dig a hole on
the other side. Then you'll have to jack it up twice!

The above comments are based on about fifteen years of desert driving
in said baja.  I never used it after the first experience of digging
out.  It is a great idea for making quick turns in a 700 lb. sand
rail. (Which is why they're called 'cutting brakes'.)  Getting a two
ton bus unstuck is an entirely different situation.  

As always, YMMV.
