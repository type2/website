Subject: Re: [T2] rebuilt engine won't start - UPDATE -

Don't cook your starter. They aren't made for cranking more than a few 
seconds (less than 20?) or so each time....

Bench bleed 'em - they will take a few hours of your time and cost you 
nothing. Flywheels and starters = money...

&gt;hey list,
&gt;
&gt;today i had my first AIRS experience. I called up Stefan Ufer this afternoon
&gt;and he came and took a look at my bus that with rebuilt engine that won't
&gt;start.
&gt;
&gt;Yes the distributor drive gear is in staright. yes the timing is set. we
&gt;tried moving the dizzy around while cranking to see if it caught. it didn't.
&gt;we pulled a valve cover off and cranked it and stefan said that the rocker
&gt;arms were barely moving, and concluded that my hydraulic lifters needed to
&gt;be bled. his prescription was to first try cranking it a lot until the oil
&gt;light went out or the battery went dead. repeat as necesary to acheive oil
&gt;pressure. if that doesn't work, take off the rockers, pushrods, pushrod
&gt;tubes, and lifters and bench bleed them. not hard but very time consuming.
&gt;if THAT doesn't work i've got bigger problems.
&gt;
&gt;So i've been cranking and cranking until the battery goes dead 3 or 4 times
&gt;now. the battery's starting to go dead faster now. the battery is less than
&gt;1 year old. oil light still stays on, engine doesn't run at all, but fires
&gt;every now and then. argh
&gt;
&gt;any 2nd opinions. thanks guys for all the responses. I love this list and
&gt;everybody on it :)
&gt;
&gt;Peace,
