Subject: Re: [T2] Fire!

Glad you didn't go against me too hard.
I had an engine fire, every little damage, caused by neglect.
I smelled fuel and did nothing about it.
I put the fire out with a standard extinguisher and I swear it did more
damage than the fire, yellow stinky powder all over the place.
If your engine compartment is sealed good a small Co2 bottle would be
sufficient to remove all of the oxygen but the compartment needs to stay
sealed for several minutes so you avoid re-flash after your fire is out.

&gt; &gt; Why all of this paranoia about engine fires ?
&gt; 
&gt; I'm paranoid not only for my bus but also for my 411 (which someone
&gt; accurately pointed out on an earlier email that the 411 liked to 
&gt; burst
&gt; into flames)
&gt; 
&gt; Besides, I see this as no difference than getting full coverage 
&gt; insurance.
&gt; If I'm going to dump money onto my bus, spending a few extra 
&gt; hundred
&gt; dollars for a fire suppression system, plus your good advice of 
&gt; keeping
&gt; fuel lines in order, can only help not hinder.
