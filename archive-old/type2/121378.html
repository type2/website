Subject: Electronic flasher relay

Volks,

A while ago I asked if anyone knew of a replacement flasher relay that was electronic, which would hopefully enable the use of LED lights (the stock relay won't work because the LEDs draw so little current that it triggers the rapid flashing).  I've since given up (for now) on the LED lights but last week my flasher relay went out again - 2nd time in 15 years.  I didn't want to wait for one from a mail-order FAPS so I called Autozone and they actually had one in stock that was a direct replacement.  I bought it, installed it, and by George it works!  Price was $9.99 and it is part #EP35 &quot;12-Volt 3-terminal electronic turn signal or hazard warning with lamp outage indicator&quot; (hmmm, maybe it won't work with LEDs after all).  Made in USA by Tridon/Stant.  Makes a subdued, pleasant clicking noise while it does it's business.

-David
