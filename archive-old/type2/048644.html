Subject: [T2] Dead bus

Where in France is your bus? I could tow it to the port with my Volvo. Or
could you go north &amp; get recovered from Germany? I am in West London, so let
me know (good excuse for a beer run!). I'm not sure of the law in France on
towing, you might be better to hire a car trailer or something. Always comes
down to £'s though. Call me
