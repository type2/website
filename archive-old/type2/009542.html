Graham,

I go to my local CENEX and ask for &quot;cleaning solvent.&quot;  It's much like
paint thinner or kerosene.  I pour some in a puddle on one edge of the
oil, let it sit and wipe it down.  I then progressively work my way
through the spill.  The thing is, if the oil has been there a long
time and has captured a lot of dust and material, it's going to take 
longer to clean and be a messier job.  Then, if there's still some left,
I wait for a slightlty breezy day and use some brake cleaner on it.

WARNING!!!  Solvent is flammable, not as bad as gasoline, but still
plenty bad ju-ju!  Brake cleaner is VERY flammable and makes 
gasoline look like water!  Also, do NOT use a wire brush with any of
this stuff!  If you need a brush, get a nylon fingernail brush or a 
heavy duty tooth brush.

Mark
