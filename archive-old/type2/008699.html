Hello

-&gt;should there be a fairly thick gasket between the bottom of the carbs and
-&gt;the top of the mainifold.? 

Yes, there is a gasket that goes between the carb and the manifold.  Did you
check the mating surface of the bottom of the carb while it was out.  Take a
straight edge and place it on the bottom, it should not be warped.  Mine
were.  I took a piece of glass, taped some sand paper to it, and rubbed the
bottom of the carb over the sand paper, until the entire thing was shinny
with newly exposed metal.  Clean it up before reintallation.


-&gt;well...  and when I removed the carbs for rebuild the other day. The right
-&gt;hand carb seemed to be both wet with gas and carboned in the throat.  Any
-&gt;thoughts on this?

Now that it is clean and dry, try and see if gass still comes out, and if so
where.  Mine leaked at the throttle bore.  The carbon, I don't know.  Maybe
lots of backfires, but that is just a guess.


-&gt;A rebuilding question... I've replaced the automatic choke as per the
-&gt;bently... I screwed this up previously... is there a way to test before
-&gt;reinstallation?

Install it, note the position of the choke.  Apply 12volts to the choke, and
make sure it opens.  If you just turn the key to on to apply the power to
the choke, be careful you do not fry your points.  


-&gt;One more.... there are four electrical connections on the left hand carb...
-&gt;I want to make up a new wire for this.  Can I make an octopus and have four
-&gt;wires soldered into the one wire that goes to the coil???
-&gt;

yes.



have fun,
        brandy
