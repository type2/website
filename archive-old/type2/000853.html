Subject: Gas mileage woes...part 2
Date: Sat, 21 Oct 2000 20:24:08 -0500

Hello all,

 I'm in a bind tonight. A few weeks ago, I asked the list what they thought
could be wrong with the motor in my 82 and just about everyone said that it
is my temp II sensor that was causing bad gas mileage. Well, I replaced it
with a good sensor and still I have bad MPG...today, I got 13.21mpg!

 The question that comes to mind is...could excessive blowby cause my
mileage to be that bad???? That is about my last guess, I've done just about
everything else people on this great list has recommended.

Help!!!
