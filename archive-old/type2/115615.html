Subject: Re: [T2]heres what i came up with for flywheel lock!

That looks like it might do the job if you have the strength to hold it
steady, but a better way is to make a bar long enough to go under two of the
clutch bolts, then it won't pivot as you try to tighten the flywheel.

See how you get on with it and let us know.
