Subject: RE: [T2] Bus motor replacement

&gt; Some people suggested that the T might constrict fuel flow back to &gt; the
tank, so I rigged a direct line from the fuel pressure regulator &gt; back to the
filler neck and observed the fuel pressure at idle and at &gt; high RPM; it made
no difference whatsoever.&gt;  The variance in fuel pressure is because the
system is blow thru turbo, the regulator is boost refrenced so fuel pressure
goes up with boost pound for pound, guess I wasn't clear.  Haven't had any
issues running this system for 5 years now.JT Beaufort, SC Running: 1. 62
