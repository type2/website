Subject: Re: [T2] Electronic Ignition Kits

Mark, I have an older Crane XR700 kit I havne't installed yet, but on looking at the plastic collar they supply(shutter), it goes over the lobes and the slot that lets the light through to the optical trigger, sits halfway between the lobes on the dizzy shaft. That means it will fire between the lobes instead of on them as points would. Will I just turn my dizzy that bit more to adjust the timing then to make up for the different place the dizzy is going to fire? 
Also, some are saying this is a HEI or CDI setup, but I think it is only a point replcaement system, correct?
Thanks,
Courtney
