Subject: First Engine Pull - Success!!

Hey,

It's 1:45am, just got in from finally getting the engine out of my '79
Westy.  Thanks for all the help!  Some of it came a little late, but I'll
know better next time.  Here's what I learned, maybe it will help someone
else.  This is on a '79 Deluxe Westy, non CA, manual transmission, AC, stock
FI 2 liter.  Other models probably vary.

1.  I decided to attempt to pull the engine w/o touching the transmission.
Take others advise and pull both at the same time.  I ended up removing the
muffler (actually I removed the muffler to remove the heat shield above the
muffler, which wouldn't come out any other way.  I also had to loosen the
oil fill tube to allow it to move towards the engine.  Also had to remove
the AC compressor and mounting bracket.  I don't know about other years, but
on this one, if your trying to pull an engine only, this stuff must come
off.  Even with the fan shroud hitting the back of the engine compartment,
the trans shaft was still inside of the clutch plate.  I had to do some
creative lifting and tilting to get it to come out.  Not an easy task on
this heavy engine when your by yourself.

2.  Save yourself the frustration and possible injury:  get someone to help
you.  I know some of you guys do it by yourself all time, but you must admit
that this engine is HEAVY.  Definitively not like the 1600 bug engines I
remember from my youth.

3.  This operation will take time.  I received posts from people saying it
was a piece of cake, shouldn't take more than an hour.  Maybe I'm incredibly
slow, or maybe I ran into a few too many rusted bolts, or these guys are
really good and I should be paying them to teach me how to do it right, but
it took me a grand total of 10 hours spread over 2 days. I'm sure this is
something that gets easier with every try.

4.  Forget Bentley, the procedure is not complete.  Don't have a Hayes,
maybe it's better.

Now to replace the clutch, fuel lines, vacuum hoses and everything else that
I can get to with this beauty out and easily accessible.

Thanks for listening to me ramble...I think I'm delirious....
