Subject: Re: [T2] Adapter - Lugless engine into Bus

I ran across that item while i was looking for something else 
yesterday.  fortunately i remembered where.
www.aircooled_dot_net
and his part number is
ECA0009
The reason for temporary is probably from what you have to do.  Remove 
studs for oil pump and replace with longer ones that you will attach the 
bracket to.
