Contributing to a FART here but;

I have had three vehicles in the past five years (not counting busses).
All were jap beaters.
Total purchase investment - 600+1500-750+500=3D 1850+ $250 in parts=3D 21=
00.
Total mileage at about 20k/year =3D aprrox 100k miles.

About $.02 a mile. This does not take into account insurance, oil or
gasoline...might put it at a nickle a mile, maybe.
