Hey all,
I've got a Bentley for Beetle, Super Beetle and Karmann Ghia 1970-1979
that I have just sitting around.  I bought it a few years back when I
bought my first car, a 1975 Beetle.  I sold that puppy a while back and
included the Muir book but for some reason kept the Bentley.  It hasn't
been used since then and is in not quite excellent but very close to
excellent condition.  It's not greasy and all the pages are there, the
plastic laminate hasn't even started peeling off the cover.  I've got no
real use for it, I don't see myself buying a Beetle or a Ghia anytime in
the forseeable future, so if anyone wants it, I'll sell it for $20 plus
shipping.  

Let me know,
Sean

sbart7kb_at_www.mwc_dot_edu          Perceiving the pathway to truth,
'81 Vanagon Westy             Was struck with astonishment.
'78 Bus (For Sale)            It was thickly grown with weeds.
                              &quot;Ha,&quot; he said,
                              &quot;I see that none has passed here
                              In a long time.&quot;
                              Later he saw that each weed
                              Was a singular knife.
                              &quot;Well,&quot; he mumbled at last,
                              &quot;Doubtless there are other roads.&quot;
