The last time I had that with The Bounty (decent dualport with 34,3 stock
setup) I found my mixture (lower small screw driver side of carb) was just
a tetch lean.  Problem reccurred a few days later in heavy traffic.  Ran
into an older german fellow who was working for VW in '71 (had to add the
story cuz it's cool)  He helped me set it jusssst right.  Took about 10
minutes...2 for him to do it, and 8 to explain how if I hadn't been stuck
in traffic I'd probably have been just fine.

The other thing that comes to mind is a clogged carb.  If you have rust in
your tank, the filter doesn't get it all, some sneaks through anyway, and
you have to clean it out.  I'll let on of the &quot;List Gods&quot; tell ya how ta do
it right proper an all cuz that's why they're here...that and mild amusment
at how we mess up I'm guess'n.
