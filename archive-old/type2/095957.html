Subject: Installing cruise on 81 aircooled Vanagon

Please do not waste bandwidth with the usual replies of broomstick, =
brick, etc. :)


I have read about the Rostra Ultracruise and the Audiovox.........I =
searched on the web about the Rostra and talked to a few dealers, and =
they claim no vanagon application, although a few listees have done it.  =
One dealer claims there is a unit by ARA that will work on a vanagon, =
however I can find nothing on it.

I am going on a long vacation in a month, and want to install before i =
go.....any help is appreciated .  Most of my driving is over flat land, =
so cruise would be a big help.
