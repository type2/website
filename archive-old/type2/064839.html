...along with other sound advice on the speedo cable, etc.

On the crossover pipe problem, it may very well be a dealer-only
part.  Having a dealer nearby is not necessarily a good thing and
since you don't there are other options.  I browsed through the
BusBoys catalog.  They do have Vanagon exhaust parts--but they
only show wasserboxer parts.  They may have '82 parts as well.
since they do carry older bus parts (916) 244-1616.

 I also checked the Parts Place catalog.  They list Vanagon
exhaust parts, but I don't see the crossover pipe listed.  They
also sell used parts, though I'm not sure I can recommend a used
exhaust part (810) 373-5950.

If you're stuck with dealer-only, call Camelback VW in Phoenix
(800) 876-5199.  I was told to ask for Bill, but found out there
are two Bills there.

I assume shipping will be a good chuck of your invoice in
any case, but these are at least some viable options.

On the fuel gauge, Mike West's advice on the fuse is the first
place to start.  Looks like fuse #12 on my Bentley wiring
diagram.  If the fuse is good, use a test light or meter to see
that you're getting juice at the voltage stabilizer (on the back
of the gauge on most), then to see that you're getting juice
coming out of the stabilizer and to the gauge, then to see if the
power is coming out of the gauge and to the sender.  Testing the
sender is more a matter of grounding the wire from the gauge to
the sender.  If it registers nothing on the gauge, it's not the
sender.  If the gauge goes to 1/1, then the problem is with the
sender.

Also, since the split of the Type2 and Vanagon lists, the
air-cooled Vanagons are kinda split too.  Someone over on Vanagon
my have a better source for air-cooled Vanagon exhaust parts.
