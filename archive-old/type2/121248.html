Subject: Re: Stainless Stell/Steel bimetalic corrosion problems?

Was wondering what the answer is this question?   I am cutting out a couple of
rust holes and cleaning up the battery tray and I was going to put in a
stainless steel tray over the holes to place the battery in.  A local metal
worker suggested I use silicone sealant, if the surface area between the steel
tray and the remaining sheet metal was large, to adhear the new tray to the
old.   No welding and no drilling holes into the stainless steel tray...

Does putting stainless steel parts on a Bus cause bi-metalic corrosion
problems?
