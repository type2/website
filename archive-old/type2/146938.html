Subject: Any spare westy stuff going ?

Since I'll be shipping Victor's 71 in the next few weeks I thought I'd 
ask if anyone had any spare westy bits they wanted to get rid of /sell.  
I'll take a good look at the pictures of the bus again to try and see 
what I might need.  Do we know who actually went to see the bus at 
Victors place ?

I'm paying a fair amount for the shipping so I might as well fill the 
bus.  Yes I'll have to pay duty on any parts and yes having parts in a 
bus is less secure (apparantly).  In particular it would be nice to get 
the original westy tent ?? I guess they're like hens teeth though.

If anyone wants anything shipping to the uk then we could work on that too.

Lee
