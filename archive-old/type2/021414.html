Chet:
You should NOT leave the ignition turned on without the engine running. This
will burn your points in about 1/2 hour. And it could ruin your coil. The points
are not designed to pass a constant current thru them, only intermittant
current. If your radio is wired to come on with the ignition, use a relay and
hook it to the door-key buzzer wire. That way it'll play with the key in and not
turned onto ignition.
Damn VW could never figure out why Americans had an accessory position on their
ignition switches!
Click and Clack (the Tappet Brothers) Magliocchi (sp?) constantly complain about
Germans missing something with the accessory position in their show._Car Talk_.
The electronic ignition debate is pretty subjective. I believe electronic will
make the plugs last longer because the spark is less duration. It will also fire
with more voltage available.
I'm not sure that accessory companies' electronic ignitions are nearly as good
as a stock one from a California specced 79-83. and these parts are available at
pick-n-pulls.
The stock points/condenser/coil system is stone-axe simple and will rarely leave
you walking. Just need to change the points and condenser every 10-20k miles.
I'd just get new Bosch points and condenser and set them right .
(If you do put in an aftermarket system, save EVERY OLD PART, including screws,
put them in a baggie and stow them where you can find them late some nite when
it dies and you have to change it back in a parking lot somewhere!)
And hook your radio up somewhere else!

&gt; it just sits there and cranks but no start.  I can smell gas, so I don't
&gt; think it's the injectors.  I checked for spark coming out of the coil into
&gt; the center of the distributor and found I had a small, yellowish-white spark
&gt; that would only spark if it was about 1/8&quot; away from a ground.  Also, my
&gt; coil gets EXTREMELY hot even when I'm only using the radio.  Could my coil
&gt; be shot?  If so, this would be my second coil within probably 1500 miles.
&gt; What would be causing this if it's the problem?
