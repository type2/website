Subject: '78 Sunroof new owner basics

Hi all,

My wife Rachel and I are the proud new owners (I'd say parents, but 
it's older than either of us!) of a 1978 Sunroof Bus with a '79 motor 
and FI.  The motor is a remanufactured unit from VW Canada.  I have 
fond memories of riding in Dad's '68 Bus when I was a tyke--well, OK 
most memories are of holding wrenches for him while he was under it :-)

This is my first time as an A/C owner, and it's such a nice bus, I 
don't want to wreck it!  The motor is reported to have only about 15k 
on it.  It ran fine for the 600 miles we drove it home through the 
mountains, more power than I expected.  My main wrenching experience is 
with an old (1967) Land Rover.  The bus and Rover seem to be two very 
different beasts with the main similarity being that there both slow.  
The Rover likes low revs, has ridiculous cooling capacity and a heater 
that once melted a shoe!  I'm somewhat familiar with Bosch FI, having 
kept an 80s Saab running with LH-Jet.

We're hoping to get all the little surface rust POR-15ed before the 
snow flies and are slowly surveying what else needs to be done.  What 
we'd love to have is a list of wisdom.

1)  Things most old busses need done (bonus points for hidden stuff)

and

2)  How to drive and take care of it so it'll last (especially tips on 
aircooled driving)

all the best,
joe and rachel broach
missoula, mt
