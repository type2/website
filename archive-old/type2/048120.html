Subject: [T2] Volkswagenhomebrew_dot_com update

We would like to thank everyone who has checked out &lt;A 
HREF=&quot;http://volkswagenhomebrew_dot_com/&quot;&gt;http://volkswagenhomebrew_dot_com/&lt;/A&gt; in 
the past few weeks since it has been up. We have had so many people asking 
for parts hard to keep up with all the e-mails we are getting and trying to 
fill peoples request right away. If we have not got back to you about a part 
you requested don't worry we will get back with you. We are in the process of 
moving everything to a new shop soon.  At this new shop we will have more 
room to work on buses getting them ready to be sold, parted out or fixed. We 
will also be more up to date with what parts we have after the move.  

We still have many Volkswagens that still need to be posted on the site. 
Working on the site has also been slow since our free time has been taken up 
by preparing for the move. Thanks again everyone for checking out our site.

Dan and Brian
