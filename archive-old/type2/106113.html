Subject: Re: [T2] Re: bus middle seat - will '77 fit '71?

Hi there-
I have a black full width rear seat from a '74 (no headrest holes,
though) in great shape located in Vancouver, BC, if anyone is interested.

Cheers,
Matthew
'73 Westy
'74 Kombi

&gt; Yes, but...... the 71 will not have headrest holes. These came along in
73.
&gt; 68 to 79 middle seat mounting were all the same. There are 3/4 and full
width seats. The full width seats are
&gt; tough to find.
