Gig it out.  I'm as much for stock busses as I am for crazy ones 
(although I am a bit grossed out by the lowrider variety so common in 
central Florida) but combining different years of stock pharaphanalia is 
definitely a plus!!!  Don't worry about the stock integrity if you LIKE 
THE WAY IT LOOKS.
