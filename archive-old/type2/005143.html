There was a worm running on the Internet for the last day or so, &quot;seeding&quot;
MS Webservers with the code to launch a massive attack against
whitehouse_dot_gov (real, not the porn site) as at July 20, estimates from the
bodies on the web who watch these things, were that about 1/4 million web
sites were infected, but the code was trashing OTHER boxes as well, when it
tried to download the code, so there are probably 2-3 times that many boxes
down.

Type2_dot_com may have been one of them, or they may have shut it down to
protect it (as I did mine).

The admins will no doubt tell us what the real story is ASAP.

is
&gt; just enjoying the weather!
