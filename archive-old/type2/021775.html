Subject: Re: [T2] brake booster hoses/ check valve

Mike:
This is a 72 with a 1700 and stock Solexes, right? Original equipment
would have been a rather complicated fabricated tube spider-like
contraption with about 4 legs actually.
With dual single barrel carbs on a boxer VW engine it is important to have
a balance pipe between the two manifolds to insure a steady vacuum. This
also is the best place to hook up the vacuum source for the power brakes.
The brakes will work while only hooked up to one side, but the balance
pipe is necessary for a smooth idle.
The check valve goes on the tube in the engine compartment just before it
goe thru the firewall.

&gt; necesary and/or desirable to have two hoses connected to
&gt; the booster? Seems like the plumbing would be simpler
&gt; with just one.
