Subject: Re: [T2]  2.0L Engine Noise

 
For what it's worth, my bus makes an incredible shuttering, the whole vehicle shakes sometimes when I'm starting out in first or second.

The list gave me some ideas, but this motor mount one makes a lot of sense. I don't have the problem at speeds, just under the high torque of getting started.

I'll be checking the motor mounts this weekend. It's a lot cheaper than a rebuild anyway.

&gt;My 2.0L engine started making a similar noise - right before I shut &gt;it down and rebuilt it.....I hope it's just an engine mount issue, but I fear the worst.
