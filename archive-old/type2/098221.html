Subject: Re: [T2] Oil Pressure Drop

frank,
	I am not 100% sure of your question. are you saying that it DOES
keep heating to 240 &amp; the pressure drops to 20, or WHAT IF it does
that? What have the trends of this engine been? always like this, or
just recently started to really heat up.

&gt; The last two weeks in Ohio have been very cool.  I have noticed that the 71
&gt; 1600 DP will start at about 40 oil PSI, and after warming say 40 miles, it
&gt; will drop to about 30 PSI.  What I am concerned about is that after a while,
&gt; the temp will get say 240 and the PSI drops to 20 +.  What do I need to
&gt; troubleshoot?
