Subject: Re: [T2] Towing Jetta for 100 miles

A wheel dolly would be the best way---other than a trailer--

Available at any U-Haul, or Ryder rental outlet.

miles 
Good morning, 
Can someone please advise a safe, legal &amp; affordable way to tow a scrap
Jetta for 100 miles ? 
I have located a nice scrap 1987Jetta for 60$USD that I'd love to keep
for spare parts, however it needs to be towed to a good storage space.
It seems to have four good tires and could probably be towed on all
fours. 
I will tow behind my bus or behind another Jetta. Are tow bars available
for purchase? Are straps w/ some lights legal on the highway? All help
appreciated. 
Thank you,
Shawn.
