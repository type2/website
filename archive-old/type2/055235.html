&gt; Not just a little crack but huge dry rot cracks and large openings. I got my
&gt; boot from RMMW last summer. Is this normal? It was only $16.00 - came with
&gt; grease and hardware- but my gosh! one year!

It is EXTREMELY common with german rubber items.

I try to buy german metal items when i can but i have been burned one too
many times by german rubber items, they have all been sitting on a shelf
for 20 years i think, either that or the germans dont know how to make
rubber.

Go get the boots at NAPA or carquest or wherever., they have nice american
made ones out of really HQ rubber, no problems with those.

take care,

Steve

p.s. i had balljoints put on my 71, 3 brazillian one german, the german
one's boot split within 3 months.
