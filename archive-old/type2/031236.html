&gt; I had occasion to check my timing today.
&gt; At full throttle, the reading on the degree pulley was fairly stable and I
&gt; set timing for 28 degrees.
&gt; At all lower rpms, the reading danced around and I couldn't guess a reading
&gt; to within +/- 5 degrees.
&gt; 
&gt; This was for a never used 009 and a Petronix which I installed yesterday.
&gt; 
&gt; Could be my timing light, I guess. Or could be a defective distributor.
&gt; 
&gt; My question:  Can anyone report rock steady readings at all rpms?  If so,
&gt; any secrets for achieving this?

are you talking Dwell angle or advance.

advance should move with RPM, unless you are holding the RPM's rock steady
the advance will dance around a little, my 78 with a petronix and correct
vacuum advance distributor, will smoothly advance through it's range and
if I hold the RPMs steady it will hold pretty steady

with the Petronix the dwell angle is rock steady from 950-to whatever RPM
