Subject: Re: Nordstrom Shoes, Car Crushers, Classic Cars and Man-Haters

My 2-cents worth:

A) Today Caddies, tomorrow VWs = slippery slope. The two do not
necessarily follow. However, it is a shame to destroy a beautiful
vintage car, but it's amazing what they can do with scale models these
days. There, there....

B) I think it's sexist. Women being mean to men is no more acceptable
than men being mean to women. But then I'm not into buying shoes at
Nordstrom or anywhere else, so I'm not gonna see the humor in it anyway.

C) &quot;I have noticed where it is considered &quot;cute&quot; or &quot;funny&quot; when people
are very, very mean-spirited.&quot; I noticed this trend in sit-coms way, way
back. I find it very disturbing. I don't watch much TV anymore.

As always, MHO,

Nikki
