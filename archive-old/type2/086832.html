&gt; All of which makes me think............is there anybody out there who would

that is a seriously major undertaking

&gt; particularly thinking of a profit-making enterprise here.  It simply seems to 
&gt; me that many of the Bus related tasks we eventually get around to can be 
&gt; described much better than the material we now have.  It might also be a way 
&gt; of helping to &quot;pay back&quot; a lot of the folks who have dispensed their 
&gt; knowledge and given of their time.

but maybe an addendum to the Bentley with more &quot;home mechanic&quot;&quot; type of
tidbits and hints.

&gt; Well, just a thought.  But if this sounds interesting, drop me a P-Mail.

if you decide to &quot;Edit&quot; said book or addendum let me know I have futzed
with the auto tranny more than I could have wanted to, maybe could add a
paragraph or two
