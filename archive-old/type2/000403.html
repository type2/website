Subject: OK... so I'm a dumb a$$

and don't know the difference between a battery isolator and a voltage
regulator  http://www.type2_dot_com/~type2reflect/msg23755.html  I really would
like to get my newly rebuilt engine running this weekend.  The problem I'm
having is the starter will not turn over (nothing when ignition switch is
turned other than dimming of idiot lights). The electricals worked fine
prior to rebuild.  It appears that I don't have a voltage regulator.  Is
that possible??? The only other devise mounted on the firewall is a 2 x 2
1/2 &quot; black box with 3 wires coming out into a clip connector (goes to
alternator) It says Borg-Warner on top. With the wires connected like I
think they were before, I'm getting a spark when I touch the ground strap to
the body with everything off (short).  Please help!!!
