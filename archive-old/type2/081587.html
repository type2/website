Subject: Re: [VB] repair reservoir

For which bus?   [the 68 is one-year-only, I thought I sent you one?]
I really don't think there is a way to patch them. Usually they become very
brittle.

Subject: [VB] repair reservoir


&gt; has anyone ever fixed a cracked brake fluid reservoir. Is it made of cast
&gt; nylon? is it possible to weld/melt a repair? I have a spare Im thinking of
&gt; experimenting on. Im thinking I could plug a cheap soldering iron into a
&gt; variac and vary the temp until I got a melt without burning.
&gt; Any / all thoughts appreciated.
