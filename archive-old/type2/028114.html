YOU PEOPLE ROCK!!!! The amount received so far is $559.00 and this is only
thru pen-pal' I haven't gotten any mail yet! Can't wait for Monday
delivery..........

I thought I would answer the questions asked of me personally directly to
the list instead of individually.

1) A specific, LIST ONLY, pay-pal account has been set up at
tedebare_at_one_dot_net.

2) I know nothing about the computer end of the list, so please direct all
computer related ideas and suggestions to them. I have forwarded all the
computer messages I received from you all to them. ( I'm pretty sure I got
all of them.)

3) Checks should be made out to Type2 List Fund.

You people are great- keep it coming- LONG LIVE THE LIST

More to follow..... TBear
