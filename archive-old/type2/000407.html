he used an adapter, but I don't know who from
&lt;snip&gt;

	There's a company in CA called Kennedy Engineering, if memory serves, that makes adapter plates that will bolt just about any ungodly engine from a Mazda rotary to a Mopar Hemi right onto your bell housing. Look for a little ad in the back of Hot VW.
	My own thinking is that the only thing worse than a loaf of of Wonder Bread on wheels that only sixty five is a loaf of Wonder Bread on wheels that goes ninety. Spend the fifteen hundred dollars on a bike if you need to go fast.
