Subject: Trivia question

Howdy,	
	Here's one.  I have a Campmobile with vehicle ID numbers that
classify a 1970.  Indeed the rear tail-break-signal lamps are a 1 piece oval
design with the backup lamp just above in a separate, clear glass rectangle
unit (suggesting 68'-74'?).  
	However, The vehicle nose has the signal-running lamps up top on
either side of the air inlet vents(suggesting 74'?-79), instead of below
just above the front bumper.  
	I'm in the middle of doing the body work.  There is rust/impact
damage to both tail and nose sections.  While scraping the paint and rust I
could find no patching or weld marks for the rear sections.  The front nose
had a piece hastly spot welded and bodyfilled (the traditional rust area at
the very bottom). 
	 Is it possible that the entire front of the bus was replaced with a
later modle nose piece after an accident?		Thank you in
advance.	Dan
