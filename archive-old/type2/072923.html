Subject: bay bus rim question

I have a 70... it has 72 front and rear spindles, so I could get frontdisk
brakes. This is good! (BTW, when you do this, you MUST change the rear
hardware as well, OR carry 2 different spares - different rims!)
What I would like to do now is get 73+ brake calipers, as they are bigger
and even better, but the front spindles are different to accommodate the
larger caliper - so I need to know if

A) the RIMS for a 70-72 will fit the 73+ brake hub   and
B) is there any reason to swap the 73+ REAR brake stuff out, too?

I have access to a  free set of all spindles involved, but would rather not
have to go buy new rims........
