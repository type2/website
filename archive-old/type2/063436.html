hey now,

several folks have written asking whether i got rid of the cat, sold the cat,
microwaved the cat, etc...i'm happy to report the kat, aka Marley aka InHeat
aka PainInLeButt is doing fine and appreciates you all asking about her.

now, what i'm wondering, anyone done a cross country trip/move with said cat
and constructed kitty box in a westy somewhere...if so...how it work out?
