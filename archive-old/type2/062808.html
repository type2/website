This is a really stupid question, but,
how do you turn on the &quot;heater&quot; ?  (I know not to expect much from it).

On my dash there are two red levers and two green levers.
There is a knob that turns on the fan.  The fans have been replaced with
oversized blowers from a GMC truck.  They work, now if heat comes up
the pipe .... :-)

It's still warm around here so I wouldn't know heat from fresh air.
How is it =supposed= to work?  


Thanks,

James
