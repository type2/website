&gt; That's the right way to do it.  Gives the exhaust a larger
&gt; margin of safety since they run hotter.

       Really? I'd never heard of this either. Although
       you were sure on the money with Vee Parts, drove
       there this morning -- WOW! A whole store with
       VW bits and pieces! Excellent!
