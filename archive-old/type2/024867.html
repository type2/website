Subject: First Long Road Trip...Advice?
Message-ID: &lt;93c2ed0c.247c29ed_at_aol_dot_com&gt;

On friday I'm leaving from Springfield, MA to drive my precious 71 Westy to 
Colorado Springs, CO.  This is my first trip over a couple hours that I'm 
taking my baby on, and I was wondering if anyone had any advice for me.  Any 
tools/parts that may be essential to have, and also any veteran knowledge 
that may help me out on my way.  I'd love to hear some responses!
Thanks
peace
dave
