Could be, could be, yes, could be low on oil, nice to hear for
a 17 year old Van, and, try swapping in a synthetic GL4 rated
gear oil and see if the noise goes away.  If not, then start saving
for a *possible* transaxle transplant and drive it until the noise
gets to the 'annoyance' level.

The above thoughts based upon the noise actually coming from
the transaxle and not some other component in the general area!
