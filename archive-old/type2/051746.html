Subject: [T2] 1968 Westy Details

Hi,

There was discussion in the past weeks about 68 to 71 westy changes. 
I have posted some pics from an early 1968 westy showing the details 
of smooth poptop, green canvas for the cots, hanging net and finally 
the ultra-rare interior Jalousie window trim/seal.  They are posted 
on thesamba's image gallery under the heading of 1968 up campers. 
Here is the URL http://www.thesamba_dot_com/vw/gallery/

Enjoy
