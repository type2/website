List,

Having just returned from reading &quot;Beckett Cantrell's Tome on Dual Batts, Relays &amp; 
Safety,&quot; I wish to comment.

IMO, this piece should be required reading for anyone with or contemplating 
use and/or installation of an auxiliary battery.

To those kind enough to e-mail requests to see a schematic of my installation, let it be 
said after reading this piece, I declare mine to be of inferior design, am changing 
the way I use it, and will save for the Hella kit.

My thanks to our friends at Bus Depot for providing the link to Beckett's paper and 
keeping that kit available.

To those requesting info on my arrangement, I have decided not to post that webpage 
and parts list after all, and advise purchase of the Hella. Thanks all for your 
understanding and this discussion.

Respectfully,
