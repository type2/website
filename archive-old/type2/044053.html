Hi,

 CraigK writes:

&gt; I have a 70... it has 72 front and rear spindles...

&gt; A) the RIMS for a 70-72 will fit the 73+ brake hub

 Yes. 71-79 are all the same fit (though IIRC there are some subtle
differences in appearance).

&gt;    and
&gt; B) is there any reason to swap the 73+ REAR brake stuff out, too?

  I believe the composite rear drums are all the same after Dec. 
'72: if your '72 rears predate this then there may be a difference
but I'm not sure what it was. I see that the Bus Depot list the 
shoes seperately. Perhaps someone would shed light on the difference?

Cheers,
	 W.
