Subject: Play in trans/axle flange

I just finished greasing the CV joints on both rear axles on my '74 bus.
This job went pretty smoothly thanks to the tech articles I found on the
Type 2 site - first CV joint service I have done. (The PO actually put oil
into the boots, apparently to avoid dropping the axles to grease them!)
Anyway, the drivers side flange on the transmission has some play in it. It
is noticable when applying pressure to the drive axle. It's not a tremendous
amount, but the passengers side has no noticable movement.
Is this OK, or does this indicate that the bearing is going bad? Also, if
the bearing is bad, can the flange/bearing be removed and serviced with the
tranny in the vehicle or does the tranny have to be removed? I notice that
Bentley says some repairs are possible with the tranny in the vehicle, but I
couldn't determine if this was one of them. I also couldn't find anything on
the acceptable amount of movement.
Thanks all.

Rob
'74 Bus
