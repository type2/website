The worst offenders are the rear seals, the rear cargo door and engine door. You cannot find those except at outragous prices. The side cargo door and front doors have inexpensive brazilian seals available. Not the greatest quality (extra soft), but they work. I was told when I purchased them from my mechanic that they won't last as long WCM seals. The front doors were about $30 each and the side door was $50-60, can remember.
