Well,

their 4 wheel car haulers take a 7.00 15 bias ply.  Thats only about 1/2
taller than stock.

But... the tread is pretty much a highway rib, you'd slip and slide in any
bad weather, and im sure the rubber is as hard as a rock, so no traction
in wet.

Otherwise, a perfect tire.

take care,

Steve
