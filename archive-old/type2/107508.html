Subject: Re: [T2] head temp gauge

You could get into a long discussion here...
Most folks would agree on the VDO guage/sender set, with the special
extension wire. All this is available from the usual VW places. The sender
extension will only just barely reach if you install the gauge on the lower
left dashboard and run the wire up the left side of the bus.

Sender location is the big variable; it's SUPPOSED to go under #3 spark
plug, and everyone says this will give the best (and maybe only) accurate
readings.  The problem is it's a poor fit on a T4 engine, and a bitch to get
on with the tin in place, plus it can get torn up when you remove the spark
plug for maintenance. I tried wedging mine between the cooling fins near the
#3 plug hole, but the temps I get are obviously way too low, and VERY
dependent on engine rpm (due to cooling air flow). It's better than nothing,
I know what looks &quot;normal&quot; and could spot an unusually high temp, just
wouldn't know how high. The archives is full of opinions. I'm think of
trying the spark plug soon...

I don't know about T1 engines if that's what you got.

Whos done it, what did you use, where does the sender attach, is it worth
it.
