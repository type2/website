Subject: RE: FW: Re: [T2]fri - Where are all the busses?

You have to come to Madison, VA to see more busses. It used to be the same
here, but Northside Restoration and Custom has moved from Culpeper to Madison
and now we see more busses. He always has several in front of the shop and in
the shop. Of course, they are mostly resto work that will leave when done, but
I do get to see others busses:) They used to have a nice single cab shop
truck, but it has been sold. He has many projects lined up, so their are
always bugs and other VW's on the lot.

They do good work if anyone ever needs work done in this area of VA.

My bus usually stays in the county due to the lack of running properly and the
antique tags...

I'm outside of Fredericksburg VA and since January I have seen 0 buses on the
road. I have seen 2 vanagons one with out of state plates. It's pretty void
here also.
