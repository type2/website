   When George was running for election, he gave a campaign speech at a
warehouse in an (IIRC) Ohio warehouse. The background for the speech was
a huge pile of boxes proudly wearing &quot;Made in USA&quot; stickers...What wasn't
in the speech, was that the campaign volunteers had spent the previous
nite pasting them over the &quot;Made in China&quot; stickers... ;-(
