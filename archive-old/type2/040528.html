Subject: Oil sending unit bad????

All,

I've got a problem that I want a little advice on...

My oil light ('69 westy, 1600sp, doghouse, t-fitting
on oil sender for oil light and guage) comes on after
a good highway haul. Especially after going up a steep
hill, then using the engine to decellerate
(downshifting) to go down the other side of the hill. 

This happens with increasing regularity when I go to
work, and seems to be more frequent on hot days. Now,
the oil level is fine, and I have no leaks (well, no
more than the typical bus;-).

I have a brass &quot;T&quot;-fitting on my oil pressure sender,
so that I can operate both my dashlight and VDO oil
pressure guage...I thought this fitting might be the
culprit, but it's been on there for over 2 years, and
this is a recent problem.

I'm thinking the sending unit itself is shot, but why
the intermittant problem? Shouldn't it just fail,
outright???


PLEASE tell me it's not the oil pump! I'm working 2
jobs, with *zero* days off...I can't pull the motor,
and this is my only transportation.


I foolishly fell for the light last night. It was
dark, and I didn't have a flashlight, so I put a quart
of oil in. It didn't need it, and now I get to go
drain some off...how stupid can I be????;-)
