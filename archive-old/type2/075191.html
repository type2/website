&gt;Hello,
&gt;     I would check again for an exhaust noise. It happened to me after a 
&gt; rebuild.

I woke up several months ago out in the desert of Utah after a wonderful 
camping night , and started Casper up.
He kicked right in without my even hearing the starter motor engage.
Nice guy.

Then I heard this terrible clanging noise as I accelerated the engine.

Turned out to be my tailpipe had been bumped up to being very close to the 
bumper. It vibrated against the bumper and made one heck of a noise.

I know, sounds dumb, but it got my attention.
Maybe you have something just as simple for a non problem ?
