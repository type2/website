A few years back I went through several sets [3 or 4, as I recall] of brand
new genuine official super premium BOSCH plug wires before coming up with a
fully functional set.  The whole sordid story should be in the List
archives.

This sort of thing happens but it's always the last thing we check, assuming
because a part is brand new it must be OK.  In a perfect world, maybe.

FWIW.....

&gt;&gt;  Brand Spaning NEW sparkplug wires.  One was bad.  #4.  The hydraulic
lifters had been messed with as well (too tight?).  Sheba is now running
smooth.  Hot dog!
Thanks for all the good advice.  &lt;&lt;
