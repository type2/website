Subject: Re: [T2] sub-cultures

I have always loved the VW bus because when I was 1 year old my Uncle had a
transporter converted to a camper and  I got to sleep in the pop top. I have
loved camping and the VW bus ever since. In fact when I started looking for
one I knew it had to be a pop top.

Most of my friends when asked if they had ever been in a VW camper before
said yeah, but when I show them the Westy interior they say..oh I never knew
they were like this, I thought they were like a van. Every single one of my
friends said &quot;I have to get one of these&quot;!! Of course none of them have.

When I told my Dad I was going to my first all bus campout he asked me if
everybody just sat around and smoked pot!  Its funny how so many people
think the bus just represents hippies. Not that I mind.

Here is a pic of me in '72 in my Uncle's bus. I am the one in the diapers.

&gt; I don't think it's location.  I live in the Bay Area, and I get the same
&gt; silly questions and thumbs up.  One guy asked me if I would overheat
&gt; sitting in traffic, since there wouldn't be any air blowing over the
&gt; engine to cool it.
&gt; I have a 7-passenger, which I load full for lunch, and its the same fun
&gt; ride every time.  They just love it!  I've been at stoplights, and had
&gt; people in SUV's lean over and say they wish they had kept their 'VW van'.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Gotta love it.

&gt; &gt; I know that we're all a bunch of bus-nuts who eat, drink, and sleep

&gt; &gt; seen a camper bus, nevermind ride in one.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I just took five people to lunch in my bus, three of which are well
&gt; &gt; old
&gt; &gt; enough to remember when air-cooled VWs reigned supreme. Based on the
&gt; &gt; sheer
&gt; &gt; awe, and silly (to me) questions - you would think they were riding
&gt; &gt; in a
&gt; &gt; space ship. It was as if I had created this thing in the garage, and
&gt; &gt; it was
&gt; &gt; the only one of it's kind. The biggest suprise to them all was that
&gt; &gt; I had a
&gt; &gt; closet in my van.
