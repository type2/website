&gt; Well, the marketing guys asked me to take down my VW-CD page.  Seems they

&gt; &gt;Nobody, not even myself, has done any real market research to determine
&gt; &gt;if this is viable or not, and I think its irresponsible to just
&gt; &gt;toss out some numbers and say its not feasible.  Look at the number
&gt; &gt;of people who work on VW's compared to the number of people who
&gt; &gt;would actually even think of working on their 1996 Ford Explorer.

Just look at the success of the aftermarket air-cooled parts makers and
sellers. If people are making money by producing obscure parts for very old
vw's, then something as useful as reference all collected on a disc seems
very likely to do well. There are so many computers about, I would really
think that tons of home mechanics (and a whole bunch of students) have
machines and would eventually shell out the $$ to get that crucial wiring
diagram...
