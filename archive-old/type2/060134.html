When I bought my '79 camper, it had the original vinyl &quot;flap&quot; that goes over the hole for the radio.  It is just a slightly curved piece of thin metal (square) with screws at the bottom and is covered in vinyl.   Anyway, I installed a stereo, but kept the flap on with some jewelry box hinges at the top.  If you look at the dashboard it looks as if there is no radio there, just the vinyl flap or cover.  I just lift up the flap to operate the radio.  Quite James Bondish, if I do say so myself.

Actually, the van has been broken into a couple of times (This is Vancouver, the North American leader in auto thefts), but the *%$^#! didn't notice there was a nice new Jansen hiding behind that flap.

To me, hiding stuff seems a good alternative to alarms/flashing lights etc.
