Subject: Re: [T2] Wife sez the bus isn't reliable enough to go to
  California!

Hey....If three hippies and a green bus can make it from Ca to Illionis, 
well...almost to Illinois, then you should have noooo problem.  Just make sure you 
pack your AAA card, the AIRS rescue list and a bunch of spare parts and 
you'll be fine.
  Might want to also have some spare $$ just in case you have to send the 
wife home on a greyhound if you get stuck someplace.  :-)
