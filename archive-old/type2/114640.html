Subject: Inverter--really

OK, so let's say that you do want to run an inverter in your camper for 
Christmas lights, CD player, lava lamp. You know, just the necessities. 
How much is too much to be draining off the battery overnight?

I guess what I'm trying to figure is what size inverter would be safe 
to use, how to connect (silver socket with adapter?) and how to monitor 
battery usage?

Thanks
