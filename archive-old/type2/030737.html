&gt; That's very strange - I find it very hard to believe that wires alone would

I replaced the spark plugs, too. I've been leaving them gapped at .025,
that's what they're at out of the box. I've seen specs that suggest the
gap should be .025-.028. Sorry, I know some of the questions I've asked
must be in the archives, but I've had trouble getting to them. This is a
source of a great deal of my frustration, that the information I'm getting
doesn't all match. 

&gt; Here's a second opinion:  Whoever told you that normal was 125-158 was dead
&gt; wrong.  &quot;Normal&quot; is a matter of much debate but it is generally accepted

Uh... It was the little sticker on the fan housing. I suppose 'operating
temperature' might not actually refer to the oil temperature, but the temp
measured somewhere else.

&gt; statement, 25 more degrees is probably not going to kill your engine, at
&gt; least in the short term, but I would argue that 275 *is* extremely hot, and

OK. Yeah, I've been trying to keep it under 210. I'm still thinking I'm
gonna keep it under 220-230, since the engine may be on its last legs, but
it's good to know I have a little more leeway than I've been giving
myself.

&gt; I'd get a new housemate.

Working on that one too. Have to remove the original equipment first. 
Me and my parts replacement... &lt;sigh&gt;

Thanks for the help!
