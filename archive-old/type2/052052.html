Subject: [T2] email to VW

All, VWOA doesnt seem to have an easy email address on its site, VW Germany
however does.

In the interest of informed debate I sent them this email and will post any
reply:

It has come to my attention that Volkswagen of America is pursuing legal
action
against certain suppliers of classic VW restoration parts.  I am dismayed by
this as I am often unable to procure required parts from VW dealers for my
two older Volkswagens. I participate in a worldwide email group and the
subject has been discussed vigourously. The fear is that in protecting your
trademark, you may destroy the only source of supply for restoraton and
maintenance parts for much loved older Volkswagens.  Can you please clarify
what is happening and the likely consequences in part supply terms as there
is a great deal of confusion. Thank you for your assistance, Barry Wright
