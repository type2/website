Subject: 1978 valve noise/adjustment help!

Hello all,
I just had some massive leaking from my pushrod tubes,
pulled them out and replaced the seals, reinserted
them and then readjusted the valves. For starters the
damn thing still leaks and really badly at that and
for seconds theres a funky noise starting out under
load. I'm not sure if I'm getting blowby on one of the
valves or what its is. If I advance the timing more I
dont get it but I get detonation, if I retard it, it
makes this noise and the pover is not great. 

Right now I have the valves adjusted 1 and 1/4 past
contact but I'm not sure if that's correct. Any advice
welcome. the engine is a 2.0 l fuel injected hydraulic
lifter.
