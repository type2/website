Subject: The Carbs have been re-bushed.

Hey just wanted to give you all an update-

I had the carbs for my 72 Rebushed and they are going back on the new motor
today.
The Carburetor Refactory in Richmond CA did them for $72.00 each.

I'll let you know how it all turns out when we finally get the thing running-
(should be today!)

Thanks for all your help

Thanks!
