&gt;Don't know what to tell you. I take that 1 13/16 and a six-foot water pipe
&gt;and *wail* on stuff. I always win. ;) The air socket looks far beefier than

&gt;(although I can imagine a problem the other way around, from being

I've used the impact sockets before, and they are super strong.  They are
also all 6-point (at least all the ones I have seen).  The counter person
that said you would break them was ignerrent, or he/she could just have
been selling low quality tools.  The thick walls of the sockets get in the
way in tight spots, but they are great for hi-torque applications.
