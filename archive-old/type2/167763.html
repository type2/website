Subject: Re: [T2] Sliding Window Glides?

Guys,

I can verify that the Vanagon ones can be made to work quite well....I 
used them on my Champagne edition restore.  I did have to go back and 
actually use a little glue on them when warm weather came around as they 
kept trying to come out of the frame....I didn't care if they were black 
or white...they were black.

Otherwise, they look great and slide well.

Cheers, dave

&gt; I seem to recall the ones I got from Karl for my 73 had plastic glides between the sliding part of the window
&gt; and the frame. (See the pic.)
&gt;
&gt; They seem to be missing from the windows in my 78 and because they're missing, I can open the windows from the
&gt; outside. The latch is never lifted high enough to lock into the notches in the frame.

&gt;
&gt; for 78/79 bay window sliders. It is NLA for the early Vanagons, i.e. 80-85 but still available for the later
&gt; Vanagons, i.e. 86-91 as part number 281 847 723B. You may be able to modify it?
&gt;
&gt; I have about 2 dozen 78/79 sliders. Some have the slides and some are missing. I need to fix the missing ones
&gt; one of these days..... before VW decides to make the later one NLA.
