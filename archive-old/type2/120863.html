Subject: Re: [T2] sliding door arm

Hiya Christopher,

There was a thread going on about this subject some time ago.  You might want 
to try the Archives.  However, as I recall, Karl (as usual) wound up the 
discussion with the specific colors, applications, and years.  FWIW, my 1970 
two-tone comes equipped with a chrome arm.
