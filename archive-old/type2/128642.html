Subject: Re: [T2] Witch way do Fuel Pump's go in '76? 

Hi Christopher,

If you have a stock pump and filter for a 76 (FI engine) you shouldn't 
be able to get this wrong.

7mm hose from the tank to the filter.

12mm hose from the filter to the pump. Use as short a piece of this as 
possible. (2&quot; will be fine).

7mm hose from the pump to the fuel rail.

Just remember that you want to filter the fuel before it hits the pump 
and you can't go wrong.

But if you have an aftermarket pump (ie, ford pump or a PO carb 
conversion) all bets are off.


Happy trails,

&gt; Ok, I got the normal fuel pump, little canister thingie, with hose on
&gt; either end and 2 wires on one end. The PO had it disconnected and in 
&gt; the
&gt; back seat, so I'm not sure witch way it goes. I replaced all the fuel
&gt; lines, and I'm ready to rock and roll. I have the end with the wires
&gt; going to the engine, and the wireless end getting gas from the filter
&gt; witch is connected to the gas tank. Is this the right direction, or do 
&gt; I
&gt; have it backwards?
