Subject: [T2] smaller bumper overriders

In ripping out the interior of my '70 Sundial interior I came across this
unusual hole array under the back seat. The 1&quot; thick chipboard floor just
sat on top of these holes, obviously the heat pipes. This answers my old
question of 'Why is there no heat in the cab?', but has anyone else seen
this done to their Sundials and if so, do they know *why* it was done. The
interior looks all original so all I can imagine is that it was done when
the interior was fitted (and judging by the black marking on the underside
of the chipboard it supports this).

A fellow camper friend thinks the holes just look wrong but I've never seen
any others to compare them with. I wouldn't mind just covering them over - I
really could do with any/all of the heat getting to the front window at this
time of year :)

Cheers,

Dunk
