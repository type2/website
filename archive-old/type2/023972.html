Subject: where did that brake fluid go?
Content-type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII
Content-transfer-encoding: 7bit

Doing some maintenance on the 69 this week, and found the brake fluid
reservoir empty. Took about 3/4 bottle to fill up. Brakes still work fine as I
guess there was enough in the lower reservoir above the master cylinder.
Wonder where it went? No sign of leakage on any of the wheels or MC. I
replaced most of the system last year. All new WC, all new rubber lines.

Can't tell you the time period because really have not checked the fluid level
in a while. :-(

Any guesses?
