Hi all,

I took a short trip in Clementine this weekend, (about 600 miles round
trip) and I kept an eye on the oil temperature, as well as the pressure.

I cruised at about 70 mph, the oil temp never went over 250, and the
pressure was always at 60 psi., while running, and it went down to 20
psi. when I got off the interstate, idling at stop lights.

I am using Castrol GTX 20/50, with a pint of Marvel Mystery Oil, and the
air temperature was about 85 degees.

After reading all the posts on oil pressures, and temps, I'm not really
sure as to what a safe oil pressure, or temperature should be.

I would think that 60 psi is fine, but the 20 psi makes me think
something  may be kaput.

Is it OK ?

Thanks Much,
