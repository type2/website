Sorry to take up space   
 For sale  1965 kombi. White. Walk thru. This is a very unique bus. I 
will start at the front of the bus and go back. 

68 bus boys adjustable front beam running  78 disc breakes with ,new 
disc bus master cylnder, new  ball joints ,  new tire rods ends.  new  
Wolfburg West steering box,  new wiring harness. 12 volt,  stock late 
bus wheels with good rubber,  every piece of rubber in the car is new,  
dash is cut to standard size radio. dash has three holes,  one for a 3.5 
in vdo tach,. two vdo guages. one gas one oil temp., guages come with 
bus,  stock speedo,  parcel tray has been redone,  front passenger seat 
recover but with burn hole.  driver seat is a blue vanagon seat , the 
most of the interior of the bus in covered in 1/8 luan that is painted 
black,  the back of the bus has a nice green carpet in it,  the back 
seat is a custom z bed.  also has a westy style seat behind the driver, 
In the back I took out the outboard gear boxes,  new rocky moutain gas 
tank, new sender,  bus is running redone 78 rear bearing carriers and 
late bus wheels with good rubber. Is running a stock bug trans and comes 
with a backup.  has super strong steel trans mount the has a stock bus 
trans cradle in it so the trans uses stock bug mounts.  I also converted 
this bus to run a type4 engine but could changed back to run a type1, I 
have all nessasary parts including a early bay rear hanger.  Rust wise 
this in a drier than normal bus. Cab floor is toast and will need to be 
replaced in the next year or so. Inner rockers are all good, outers are 
ok but will need attention in the future.  cargo floor good. , rear deck 
good but has a hole that was cut buy po above gas tank.  The type 4 that 
is in the bus now in not for sale because it is going in to my new 78 
double cab. I have a type1 lined up to put in the bus,. But would pefer 
to sell with out engine . this in not a stock bus , but is a very tight 
bus and all of the conversions used  vw parts. I only cut the rear apron 
to fit the type4 and have a extra.apron for type 1 install,. the 
compartment engine will seal.  The bus is in Houston TX  I am asking 
$2,500 for this bus without motor $3,000 with 1600 dp This bus is my 
pride and joy  and only the possablity of  having a type4 double cab is 
making me sell it. If you are intrested pmail me or call 713-524-5568. 
Ask for brian . Thank you for your time and thank you to every body on 
the list who helped me with this bus.    Lano  
p.s sorry I can’t spell.
