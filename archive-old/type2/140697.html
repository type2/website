Subject: REPOST:       Fresh air grill on '79 Bus

The PO had the front skin (body panel) replaced on my bus - they did a
pretty good job.  The only problem is that the fresh air grill does not sit
flush with the front of the bus.  I need to fix this and could use your
help. I'm trying to figure out what is preventing the grill from going in
further and sitting flush.   I would like to see what the clips (that the
grill screw into) look like - so if anyone has their grill off, would you
shoot some photos and either post them or pmail them to me. I'm trying to
understand their relationship or distance back from the front of the bus.  

TIA,

Wayne
