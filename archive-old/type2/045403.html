Subject: RE: [T2] Re: Auxilliary Battery Question

&gt;      I'm planning on installing an auxillary battery
&gt; in Fudd (Elmer E., my '78 Westy)  I'm curious whether
&gt; all electrical use such as radio, lights, etc will
&gt; then come soley from the new battery  or will it only
&gt; serve those things I connect directly to it.



If using my $18.95 Hella Dual Battery Relay Kit (or a similar relay kit or
isolator), you will hook up those items that you wish the second battery to
power, directly to the second battery (via fuses, of course).  When the bus
is running, they will run off of the alternator.  When it is not running,
they will run off of the second battery.
