Well said - I agree!

This govt is pathetic and self-centered. That's my political rant for the

Bus content: Planning a new engine for this spring, and a tranny rebuild.
This is gonna cost me a mint! Bus is running only local in town errands.
What a year! Hope 2005 is better, bus-wise.

Happy New Year - be safe and be well!
