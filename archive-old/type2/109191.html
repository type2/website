You may want to try www.pelicanparts_dot_com under the Porsche 914 section here
http://tinyurl_dot_com/fa4w  . They still stock some of those off the wall size
hoses. Also try BusBoys. Between those two I got almost all of the hoses
that I needed for my 2.0 FI engine. Not quite the same as the 1800 but worth
a shot.

&gt; I hope you have better luck than me.  If you do find some the right size,
I
&gt; would be eternally grateful if you would buy extra and send me some.  From
&gt; memory, you will probably need about a foot of the 4mm, 4&quot; of 9mm, 2&quot; of
&gt; 11mm and 18&quot; of 14mm.
