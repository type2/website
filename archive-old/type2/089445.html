, all exhaust valves. What causes this and if the valves are=20
sticking what causes that. This is suppose to be a brand new engine.


    Sounds like the valve guides were not reamed to fit, and or, a =
overheating issue. The valves are binding in the guides holding them =
opened and the push rod jumps out of its socket. I would contact your =
supplier, it should be a warranty situation.
    Good luck.
