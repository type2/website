Conventional...not really....

I've sloshed my fair share of tanks over the years....or is it I've been
sloshed &amp; ended up in the tank a few times...in any case I've never found a
mouse in my tank, but did find one perfectly coated and presumably cooked in
my Kentucky chicken dinner years ago...how do you spell free chicken for a
year...barrels full of the stuff...

Best thing I found was both halves of a chocolate glazed donut in my 62 tank,
along with a brand new carb fuel diaphram, which I assume was there from the
factory. Inside the Pass side door was a paper coffee cup with German
printing on it. Interesting what one finds in an old bus sometimes.

Den.

&gt; Is this 'conventional wisdom' or am I just taking things out of context?
