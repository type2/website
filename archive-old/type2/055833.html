Subject: How Much Oil is Too Much?

Howdo --
I've seen the issue of overfilling one's oil discussed frequently, and had
an additional related question of my own:  how much oil is really too much
oil -- are we talking about covering the entire dipstick or filling it an
inch over the full line?  During an oil change I've always tried to fill
mine right to the line, but there's been times when it's ended up anywhere
from 1/8 inch to 1/4 inch to 1/2 inch above the line (after which I anally
get back under there to get dirty again and drain out the excess until its
right).  I've also heard folks say that such a small distance above the
line is no big deal -- it's just when it's way up the stick when it can
cause probs.  So what's the scoop -- is slightly above the line acceptable
or must it always be at the line or below in all cases?  Thanks for your
wisdom!
