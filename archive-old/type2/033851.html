Subject: RE: Fire warning!

&gt; I always carry a fire extinguisher.  In MHO they are very inexpensive
&gt; insurance.  I've never used one on any of my vehicles, but I've seen cars 
&gt; burn to the ground.  It is not a pretty sight.  I recommend everyone buy
fire 
&gt; extinguishers.  One for each vehicle and one for the kitchen.


When I had an engine fire last summer (fuel line problem), a van stopped
right behind me and gave me his fire extinguisher. I emptied it but it had
no effect. What did put the fire out (and save the bus) was the fire station
just around the corner. It took a little more that one full fire truck to
put out the fire - slightly larger than your usual fire extinguisher. Damage
was limited to anciliaries and electrics in the engine bay and repairs were
paid for by my insurance.
I still don't carry a fire extinguisher, but the fuel lines are good.
