Subject: Re: [T2] AIRS UPDATES: (Was Re: [T2] Hi all - long)

&gt; This topic reminds me of a campfire conversation at the Dixie Bus
&gt; Gathering.... Someone there had need of the AIRS list only to discover
&gt; that about 80% of the phone numbers or email addresses in the state
&gt; they were in were no longer active.

I tried to get this started well over a year ago after being contacted by
a wayward traveller and being told how much trouble they had with the
info.
I contacted Wade several times and started verifying all of the Florida
contacts. I felt we needed to get volunteers in each state to verify and
then update the lists. I emailed first and tried to phone those who didnt
respond.
Maybe someone else needs to administer the Airs list. I tried but couldnt
seem to get Wade to do much about it.
