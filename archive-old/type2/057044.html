Subject: Size for Total Seal rings

I called Chirco to order a set of Total Seal rings for the pistons in my 1776.

When asked what size, I replied, &quot;90.5&quot; and was told that was not enough
info to place an order.   I asked what other sizes were needed and the
fellow said that I should measure the pistons!  I'm confused.  When I order
ordinary rings,  I need only specify the diameter of the piston.

Does anyone know what dimensions other than 90.5 I need for Total Seals?

Thanks, Jack
