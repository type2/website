&gt; Since I plan to put an oil temp guage on my 74 bus, I have been following
&gt; this thread with interest. As near as I can summarize, oil temps need to go
&gt; above 212F in order to drive out moisture, and temps of 220 - 240 are pretty
&gt; much OK.
&gt; 
&gt; Now for the monkey wrench: as I was tinkering in the engine compartment of
&gt; my bus last night, I noticed the remains of a spec sticker on the fan box.
&gt; This is a 74, originally set up with a 1700 engine that, according to the
&gt; sticker, met all emissions requirements in effect for CA. It gives the
&gt; timing as 10ATDC and then says: OIL TEMPERATURE 170-190F.

I believe that value is just to make sure that the engine is relatively
warm before setting the timing.
