Subject: Re: [T2] 68-71 Heater Tube Refurbish - RON, can you chime in
  here?

Apparently the talk regarding the tube seals (111-819-945 OE) had everyone
making a run on them at Airhead Parts.  We ran out yesterday.  We had a
bunch on Monday (Yes Jon, your order is on it's way).

I'm making another order to Germany today to have more flown in.

&gt; Mike,
&gt; I just got the parts from Airhead on Monday so I am pretty sure they are
&gt; still carrying them unless they just ran out. I hope not! I am sure Ron
&gt; has
&gt; them.

&gt; &gt; I decided with all of the talk about asbestos, that I would post a

&gt; &gt; about replacing 68-71 Heater Tubes. This works like a dream and has

&gt;
&gt; Hey Jon,
&gt; I have some extra tubes and the bubble wrap already so I figure I'll do
&gt; this project.  airheadparts doesn't carry the parts any more, but I
&gt; think bus depot has them.  Are these the correct parts:
&gt; http://busdepot_dot_com/details.jsp?partnumber=113255292P
&gt; http://busdepot_dot_com/details.jsp?partnumber=111819945
&gt; I'm not sure about the second one.  Hopefully Ron will be able to
&gt; confirm that the second item is in-fact the part that replaces the
&gt; asbestos collars as described on your site.
