Subject: Bonus engine plus questions

Hey Y'all,
I picked up an old 72 deluxe yesterday and discovered, much to my delight,
that in the rear passenger area there was an apparently COMPLETE 1700 engine,
complete but dis-assembled. It looks like all the parts are used except for
the case. Which appears to be a NOS case with a &quot;CB&quot; code. This thing is
spotless the only problem is that some of the studs have some surface rust
from sitting in a damp bus on a farm for a couple of years.  I am possibly
going to try to build it unless someone really needs the parts, most notable
is the NOS case. Anyone looking to buy an engine?
My questions: The cam and crank I found have some light surface rust on them
from being in the moisture, is it possible to just polish these up with a
light sanding or wire brushing on a grinder, then use them in the re-build, or
is the sanding and polishing of these parts not reecommended?
Also, can I put this engine back together and OMIT all the emissions crap?


Peace, John Baker
