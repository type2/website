Subject: Electric fuel pumps

After reading the &quot;notes&quot; today, I am confused as to what the best electric 
fuel pump is to use on my '74 Westy with twin Dellortos, all the other &quot;work 
&quot; has been done, and as far as pressure could I not use a fuel pressure 
setting device between the carbs and pump?  I have a new &quot;square&quot; purolator, 
but if they are junk, need new input. Thanks
Sid
