Subject: Re: [T2] FI ground connector needed

&gt; Does anyone have a source for the ground connector

&gt; wires to hook to.  
Okay - I've looked through all my remaining parts and
found none. Digikey has a triple male spade connector
similar to that but all three connectors are at right
angle to mounting base and mount is only a 1/8&quot; hole.
Their part # is A27871-ND and the minimum qty is 10
for $4.25 (0.425 each). As an alternative, I have
picked up a small piece of thin brass from a hobby
shop and used sheet metal snips to make my own. That
particular one would be very easy to replicate in this
fashion. -BaH
