shouldnt be to hard to come by...but it is only an aux. blower, you should
still get heat from the fan if all of the attachments are there..memory
says.  The latemodel guys will fill you in.;)

&gt; under your legs does.  Does anybody know where I can get a replacement vent

wittle bitty knob opens and closes the vent at the &quot;partition&quot; in the
floor.  sit in the drivers seat, look at the &quot;hallway&quot; and look
rearward...see that dropdown?  yup.  thats a vent.  there is a flapper
valve and some associated hoses down directly underneath the bus you can
check out.

&gt; gasket/screen for the front?  Also, has anybody tried out a SCAT bus shifter
&gt; for late t-2's?  My Shifter is clumsy and is hard as hell to get out of the
&gt; reverse-mode.

STOP!  Dont go slapping aftermarket parts on a problem!!  you have 4
(methinks) bushings as well as a coupler in the shift linkage.

the two that cause the most problems are the coupler (at the nose of the
tranny.  10 bucks, easy to replace), and the front-most bushing.  this one
is a bear, as the tranny pretty much has to be out to replace it. (the
other 2 or 3 along the shift rod require the shift rod to come out 100%
which DOES require total engine/trans removal)

You MAY, with the coupler and shifter removed, be able to get the front
bushing replaced...

anyway.  this bushing sits in the front end of the shift rod, in a hole.
there is a pin that the hole and bushing ride on...crawl underneath and
take a look, it is just forward of the shifter.  wiggle on the shift rod
at this place.  gotta lot of slop?  that would cause some problems..

the coupler in the back again will cause problems.  have someone wiggle
and work the shifter while you watch that coupler.  see all that wasted
movement?  are the big side bushings worn out? missing totally?  Yup.
replacement time..

after those 2 parts dont slop around, you are allowed to consider
disfunctional aftermarket parts...:)
