         Just to add myself into all this talk about mufflers, I just
 bought a cheapy cheapo muffler from JC Whitney. It came with a little
 rust already on it. It came with one tailpipe port, not 2. It also was
 very hard to get in, needed alot of coaxing. My question is, should I be
 afraid of what a single tail pipe is going to do? I also need to know if
 anybody out there knows a good source for the carpet underpadding for a
 71 bus, (not camper). But back to the muffler, it always pays to listen
 to what you guys have to say, I thought I could save around $100, which
 is alot of money to me, by going with a so called stock replacement, but
 I already have a queasy feeling in my stomach. I'll post the results of
 what happens when I fire her up tomorrow.
 
 Thanks from a humbled novice, &gt;&gt;

i too have purchased  a muffler or two in my more poor days.  to help 
increase the life expectancy of my el cheapo...i would sand it completely 
down to bare metal and then paint it with high temp muffler paint.  i had one 
on a b*g last me five years and when i sold it had ZERO rust.  as 
always...ymmv
