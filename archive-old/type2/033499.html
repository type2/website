Subject: rubber trim source?

anyone know where to get the following?

-rubber window seals for jalousie windows - the *inside* rubber 
seals, not the outside ones

-trim for the cieling panels in a pop-top. this is the trim piece 
that caps teh edges of the plywood ceiling panels around the opening 
in the roof.

i've asked bus depot, but they don't have a source for these parts.

also, on a somewhat related note - the inside rubber trim on my bus 
is white. i'm talking about the rubber/plastic edging that goes up 
the B column and the plastic caps that cover some of the components, 
like the hardware on the sliding door slider. mine is really filthy, 
and because of the texture of this rubber/plastic stuff, it's really 
hard to clean. anyone have recommendations on how best to clean this 
up? should i remove it and soak it in something?
