Subject: Re: [T2] Early poptop canvas

Mark said:
&quot;It has always seemed to me that if you don't have a kid small enough to fit 
in the cot up there, the stock canvas in the early poptops is quite a bit 
less than ideal.&quot;

Mark, I totally agree!!

About the only use for that cot bed is when one or two people are camping, 
and you want to get a whole bunch of junk off the floor, like back packs, 
coolers, sleeping bags, wet clothing, loose food, extra shoes, maps, and all 
the little things that add up to an inconvenience when you want to move 
around inside the vw.
