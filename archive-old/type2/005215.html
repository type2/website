&gt;I have a 1600 dp.  I have to do the engine break in but don't have a
&gt;tachometer(rpm's??).  What would 2000 rpms be??

Check the spec for your distributor full advance in degrees.
Assuming that you get to redline in the range of 4000 or more,
the  range for 2000 rpm will be about halfway up the scale you
read with a timing light. you can turn the idle adj. screw to hold
that speed steady.
