Subject: Re: [T2] Wax coating on propane tank???

David,
This thick wax coating could very well be cosmoline--sounds like it
anyway--
The best of all the best rust inhibitors--

Problem is you can't buy it anymore--the EPA took care of that--

Later,

Terry

Hello List, 
I bought a propane tank from an 81 Westy a few weeks ago. The tank was
covered in a thick layer of dust and dirt so I took some detergent and a
scrub brush and started cleaning. While cleaning it I noticed that the
light grey tank was covered with what appears to be brown wax. Is this
from the factory? Does anyone know what I am refering to? Can you still
buy this coating? It is wearing thin in spots and I would like to put
another coat on it. It is quite ulgy but It seems to work. There is
almost no surface rust on the tank at all! I will probably just make a
dimond plate shield to to cover the front of the tank once I install it
that will match my diamond plate side step. 
Thanks! 
David Kelly
