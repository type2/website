Subject: Alternator belt size

I just put on a new alternator belt because the old one was stretched and
slipping and I noticed that the size is 10x965 which is the same size that
the online sites show is right for a 72-79 bus but the owner's manual states
9x965 is the correct size.

What is the right size?  I also noticed that between two older belts I had
lying around the widths are slightly different and the distance between the
nubs on the inside are also different yet both are Continental belts labeled
10x965.
