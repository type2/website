Subject: Re: [T2] Windshield Washer and getting my pants wet...

Filipe,

The system for washing the windshield on a bus is that the fluid is driven
by air pressure in the tank through rubber lines up to a valve in the
winshield wiper switch at the top of the steering column then out thru a
second hose to the nozzles.  I am sorry to say that after all these years,
those rubber lines are usually in very sad condition and that the place
where they leak first is up at the top of the steering column, thus the
&quot;peed on&quot; sensation.

The solution is to replace the lines and to clamp them somehow.
Originally, as you will notice, VW used a clamping sleeve over each
connection.  I think at this point that a small cable tie might do the
job.

On the diameter of the line, I *think* it's 4 or 4.5mm.  If you were in
Britian, or in some other country where the use of a civilized measurement
system were the rule, I would suggest going down and buying 2 meters or so
of the correct diameter line.  If you were in the US, I would suggest that
others have had success using the clear line for fish tank air pumps,
available in pet shops.  Since I *think* that the .pr at the end of your
e-mail address means you are in Puerto Rico, I am confused as to whether
the standard is metric or something barbarous.  Take a short length of the
hose with you when you go shopping.  Better, take your washer bottle out
and take that with you.
