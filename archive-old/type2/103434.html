Try:

http://www.type2_dot_com/archive/type2/024144.html

and the needed correction

http://www.type2_dot_com/archive/type2/023348.html

I can vouch for this.  I tried it and it works great,

There is also a different (more elegant) solution in the library, under
&quot;fuel&quot; and &quot;fuel pump&quot;.

good luck!

&gt; &gt; You also have to wire in a pump relay so that you don't
&gt; &gt; become a torch if someone ever collides with you.
&gt;
&gt; Noticing that Giacomo has an after market electric fuel pump...
&gt;
&gt; How do I install a pump relay, and how does it kill the pump in a
collision?
