Subject: Re: [T2] getting over the bleeding hump


&gt;you didn't say if you changed your rubber hoses or not....i didn't when i
&gt;redid my brakes and one front disc locked and was smoking...the lines were
&gt;swollen shut.....was very strange trying to bleed, also...after changing
&gt;them worked perfect...check to see that your little equalizer halfway down
&gt;the vehicle doesn't have a loose metal line on it...

you make a really good point. in my case there was certainly crud in my
reservoir. i did pinch my rubber lines with vice grips for the sake of
rebuilding calipers, and to add new wheel cylinders. with all the this and
that something may well have clogged....? sublime.

thanks!
