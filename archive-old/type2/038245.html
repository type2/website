Subject: wiper pump wires

Replaced my wiper pump yesterday after I found a good
cheap replacement.
I ended up buying it from ....walmart,$10 and works great.
It was in the automotive section I belive.

Now since I removed it about a month ago I dont know where
the power wires hook up.  I want to use the stock switch
on the lever. Could someone supply me with the correct power
lead and where its located?

thanks alex,
77 Rivera camper, with recently cleaned canvas :)
