 (trip narr)

The private campsite north of Thermopolis is worth a little more
description. It was mostly an RV park, but had about a dozen tentsites on
one side of the grounds next to a wooded area that led to a stream. That
night, the bubbling and rushing of the stream soothed our sleep.

The campsite used to be a ranch, and still has the corrals, barns, water
tanks, etc. that one would expect on a ranch. I got up early, as I usually
do, and was greeted by a donkey, a pony, and a gaggle of geese. I began to
wonder if I was turning into St. Francis of Assisi when I realized that all
of them were expecting me to provide them with breakfast!

We ended up in Thermopolis solely thanks to several listees. Thermopolis is
the site of the world's largest mineral hot spring in the world. There is a
beautiful waterfall near the spring coated by the mineral deposits, a state
park with an indoor and outdoor pool, and two commercial water parks. We
went to Star Plunge, which has a large outdoor pool (water temp 88
degrees), an outdoor hot tub with whirlpool-like action (104 degrees), the
same indoors, a kid's waterslide outside, and an indoor and an outdoor
waterslide: $7 for each person for the day. We spent most of the morning
and early afternoon there. I got stuck in the indoor waterslide twice (I
must have had a high-friction suit), and the outdoor slide was long and
fast. The kids loved it. I did, too!

My wife Lisa really benefitted from the hot tub areas. Earlier in spring
she was hospitalized for several days with severe lower back pains. As we
were driving from Nebraska to Thermopolis, she said that she was starting
to get the same kind of pain again. After several hours in the warm waters
of Thermopolis, her back did not bother her again for the trip. A special
thanks to those who recommended we come to Thermopolis!

We ate lunch at a certain golden-arched fast-food franchise, and headed for
Yellowstone. We went through Shoshoni and the Wind River Canyon, which has
to have some of the most spectacular scenery of our trip, including
Yellowstone.

We did not have reservations at Yellowstone. I figured that it was still
relatively early in the season, and that we could find a place. Several
listees mentioned the free campground located behind the Flagg Ranch
between Yellowstone and the Grand Tetons. Due to our unexpected sojourn in
Harrison, NB, however, we had lost some time and decided to focus our
attention on Yellowstone. Coming from the east, we passed by a number of
NFS campsites until we arrived at the east entrance to Yellowstone. We
discovered that the campsite I was planning on going to was already filled.
Trying to remain hopeful, we headed toward the center of of the park. Guac
handled the ascent slowly but steadily. Since we were driving with many
RVs, Guac's pace was not a problem; besides, we made ample use of the many
turnouts. We took a picture of Guac next to the remnant of a huge snow
drift and got into a small-scale snowball fight. The contrast between the
hot springs of Thermopolis and the snowballs of Yellowstone several hours
later was striking.

After about an hour of gaping and pointing at the spectacular views between
the east entrance and Fishing Bridge, we arrived at the Fishing Bridge RV
park, which allows only hard-sided camping due to the bear problem there.
We pulled in at about 5:30pm. The guy directing traffic said that Bay
Bridge (where I had hoped to camp) was full as far as he knew, but, as of
three minutes before, there was ONE unreserved spot available in the RV
park, at $27. We didn't really want to drive any more, so we took the space.

It turned out that this was a real RV park, like a concrete pad and
hookups. That's it. The park was filled with huge RVs. It was hard to feel
much in common with these, with their satellite dishes, towing their SUVs,
etc. What was interesting is that Guac seemed tiny compared to these
gargantuans. Normally Guac is so conspicuous in parking lots because of its
height. Here Guac looked like a Geo Metro compared to its neighbors. One of
our neighbors asked us as we pulled in, &quot;Is that your home?&quot; The one that
seemed to be the biggest and most luxurious had the words &quot;Roughin' It&quot;
painted on the side.

The park registration structure had a coin laundry and showers in it. Lisa
decided to do laundry. It was a Nietzschean nightmare in there, with a
crowd of launderers pushing each other out of the way to do their laundry.
Doing laundry there was like driving in Boston in rush hour. Happy
vacation, folks!

We ate a dinner of sandwiches and drinks out of our cooler, sitting on the
edge of the side door, somewhat as a statement of values.

To be continued....
