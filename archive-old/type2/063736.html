Thanks for the info John.  It's just like the bug then.  The rear bumper 
has already been removed and it's laying inside the bus.  Unfortunately, 
the seats are all gone and the gal thinks they got sold with another bus 
she got rid of (with the glass windows in the corners.)  I'll have to 
locate some seats for this thing eventually.  The floor mat (which I 
forgot) lays in the shop with some stuff on it (it's being used for 
a floor mat in the shop :-().  So basically right now, I've got this 
white bus with no rear seats, pop-out windows all along the side, and 
it's this big metal shell on wheels.  The interior panels (vinyl wrapped 
cardboard) are all there although weathered and warped.  

I better stop because ]['m starting to ramble on...
