List,
From what i can gather from list replies, one can use the berg fullflow
adapter/pump with little or no modification of the rear bar on a 68-71 bus. 
The jury is till out on whether any production type1 cars saw cases with the
bosses cast for the rear bar.  I'll probably go with a type3 if i can't find a
late-model beetle case with the correct castings.  Thanx for all the
reponses.

Cool thing about this bus is that it had AC and the condensers are housed in
this nice, louvered (open to the front), heavy steel cover that fills the area
between the frame members up in the middle of the bus - BIG thing.  Already
has a 12v fan mounted...  i know where my cooler is going!

thanks again,
clark gordon
