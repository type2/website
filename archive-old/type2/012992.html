Stans back with another stupid question.

On one of the fuel injectors on my 83 Aircooled the little plastic nipple
around the injector core will slide in and out, but doesn't come all the
way loose. The other three injectors are tight and don't move.

The one with the moving part has tested out OK and sprays good and has a
good pattern.

The question; Is it OK to run an injector in this condition?
