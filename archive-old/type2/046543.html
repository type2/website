Subject: RE: [T2] Switch on dash question?

&gt; I have an adjustable switch on my dash between the headlight
&gt; switch and the steering column that I'm not sure what it is for
&gt; because it isn't doing anything currently.  Is it for the heater
&gt; blower that my van is missing?  Or what? The PO really did a
&gt; piece of work on this bus but I love it anyway.

Could also be for the fresh air fans some buses came with.  Does it have any
wires that lead anywhere?

Cheers,
Alistair
