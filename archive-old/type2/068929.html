Sorry for the post if it is uncool to put    For Sale's here, but....

I have a 79 Westy that I need to sell by January.  It has the type IV 
engine, and VA inspection.  Daily driver,  price $ 2000  Email me at 
  &lt;espall_at_netrix_dot_com&gt; for more info.   First baby due Feb 2, and   ' she who 
must be obeyed' has deemed all my pre 1980 vehicles unfit for family use. 
    I'll be looking for a late 80's camper soon after baby takes first 
steps......
