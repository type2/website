&gt; hello all      They make  christmas lites that are 12 volt.   I had some on 
&gt; my 66 westy's roof rack in last years parade.    I don't know where my wife 
&gt; found them but they worked real well and just pluged into the liter.    Mark

I've a feeling that the RV suppliers could provide what you need.

If not, then you could home-brew your own.  The small-bulb lights operate
with all of the bulbs in series, so they each only see a part of the total
120V supply.  What you have to do is count the number of bulbs in a single
circuit on the 120V string, then divide by 10.  This is the number of
bulbs you should have in your new 12V string.  You can then parallel as
many of the 12V strings as you like across your 12V supply.

One caution:  The way that these series strings stay lit is that the bulbs
automatically short themselves out when they burn out.  On a 110V string,
losing one bulb results in the other bulbs seeing just a bit more voltage,
due to the removal of the dead bulb's voltage drop.  The bulbs can usually
take this small change in stride, but if too many bulbs burn out the
others will go quickly as the overvoltage becomes severe.

In a shorter 12V string, the additional voltage applied to the surviving
bulbs would be quite a bit more than that experienced by the 110V string.
If you don't replace the burnt-out bulb promptly, the others will quickly
follow, resulting in a dead short across the voltage source (all bulbs
shorted).  This could result in some rather ugly melted wiring or, even
worse, a fire.  Be sure to fuse the circuit so as to prevent this.
