Subject: Lower Torsion Arm Question

Hi,

Just got my set of rebuilt torsion arms with new ball joints in the
mail. Upon examination of the parts I've noticed that one of the lower
torsion arms seems to have been machined in a less than perfect
manner. The hole which accepts the sway bar bolt seems to have been
drilled out off-center, leaving an oblong (oval) shaped hole. Is this
going to cause me grief? Should I box it up and send it back now? Or,
does the rubber sway bar mount do all the work and this imperfection
won't cause me any problem?

Thanks
peace
