Subject: Helicoils

The recent thread on helicoils has got me wondering.

I just got my engine back from AVP and each head has some kind of thread
insert in one of the spark-plug holes.  I don't know whether it is a
helicoil or timesert etc.  Should I be worried about this?  I'll be sure to
use anti-sieze on the plugs, but do these things have a history of coming
out?  It this is going to be a problem, now is the time to do something
about this before I put the engine in.
