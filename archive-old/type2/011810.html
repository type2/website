Subject: RE: [T2] Valve job

&gt;I'm adjusting my valses on my '72 Riviera for the first time and have
&gt;a question.  I got cylinder 1 to TDC and both valves were tight, no 
&gt;gap at all.  I adjusted it to 0.006 and moved the engine to cylinder 
&gt;2 TDC.  While adjusting them, I noticed that the one of the valves 
&gt;for cylnder 1 was open and so I checked it with my feeler guage.  The 
&gt;gap was bigger than it was when I had the cylnder at TDC.

No!  That's not normal!  I'd guess that you didn't have #1 at TDC, but rather 
#3 was at TDC (both are achieved with the timing notch lined up with the seem 
in the case).  If that was the case, your valves would act as described and 
you've now got your valves WAY off from where they should be.

The simplest method of finding #1 TDC is to look at your distributor cap and 
find which wire runs to cylinder #1.  Then pull the distributor cap and rotate 
the engine until the business end of the rotor (the narrower end with the metal 
on it) is pointing to where the #1 plug wire would be if the cap were still in 
place.  Then fine-tune the engine-rotating by lining up the timing notch with 
the seem in the case.  That's #1 TDC.

And of course, if you've read Muir's or any number of other sources, you know 
that after you do #1 you can rotate the engine backwards (counterclockwise) 180 
degrees to get #2 at TDC then backwards another 180 degrees for #3 then 
backwards another 180 degrees for #4.

Good luck.
