Subject: RE: Northern engine stand

   The difficulty I'm having is getting the engine on and off of
the stand.  My
   floor jack doesn't lift high enough to reach the stand, and
extra bodies for
   lifting are hard to come by at the hours I keep.  I do have a
chain hoist,
   but I haven't figured out a good way of rigging a cable onto
the engine that
   doesn't involve a lot of gymnastics I would like to avoid.
   Ideas anyone?


I use my table saw as a bench to work on my type IV engine and  I
get the engine up there by myself.
First, I use three 5/16 eye bolts.  I put one through each
upper-engine-to-transmission-bolt-hole and one through the hole
that is cast
into the case by the breather box.  (I actually use some fancy
eye bolts where the eye is a welded ring and can swivel on the
bolt.)
Second, I hook a come-a-long, cable-jack, power-pull, or whatever
you want to call it to the rafters in my garage and dangle the
other
hook about 18 inches above the engine.  ( I nailed some extra 2 X
4's into the rafters to add support so the roof wouldn't cave in
on
my head.)
Third, with some short (4 feet long) pieces of rope, I tie the
eyebolts to the hook dangling above the engine.  (Chain would
probably
be safer and easier.)
Then I just ratchet the engine up, slide the table saw under the
engine, and lower the engine onto the table.
I suppose you could also use this method to put an engine on an
engine stand.
I am guessing that each eye bolt only has to support 70 to 80
pounds so I don't think that is too much strain on the case.

Also, I always stand back and never get any part of my body under
the engine while it is hanging in the air.
