Subject: T-shirt take 2

The culture of the sites makes the difference.  Many of us hang out on Samba
as well, it is a VW community.  Ebay is decidedly not.  As was said, posts of
stuff for sale on ebay to the type2 members is somewhat insulting, as we
generally discount things to each other when we have stuff for sale.

An invitation to an Ebay shootout is not within the spirit of the list.

And honestly, if you check Ebay for bus stuff, you've seen it all already a
million times so it becomes redundant on type2.

&gt; I am curious as to what makes
&gt; the difference between ebay, and say Samba
