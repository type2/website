Subject: Re: [T2] Pics of the dangers of a front mounted spare

That was my first thought - a couple of Cali bus's are gonna get whacked

Should be fun to watch anyway. I was surprised someone on the list would
suggest it though.

&gt; Keep in mind that they will sacrifice at least two buses in order to
&gt; resolve the questions....  :(
