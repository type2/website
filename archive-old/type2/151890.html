Mark,

Ok, I've owned two splits, a 65DC and a 67 that I had for years.
...and did I mention that I am almost 6' 4&quot;!  I can actually *see* out of 
a Bay window!

Haven't ever personally seen any of the the front axle problems, just 
heard of them....but then I have pretty much never lived in the rust belt 
either.

I guess my biggest thing about splits is the dern reduction gear boxes...5 
bazillion engine rpm to go 60mph just &quot;bugs&quot; me.

Yep, *nothing* looks like a splittie going down the road!

Cheers, dave

 Hey Dave  I dont agree with that :)    Better brakes OK but only on 71 and up 
 with disc, more power, well that can be fixed at cheaper cost than a bay on a 
 splittie.  Now tell her about the rust on bays   They get it just as bad or 
 worse,  you ever see the center pivot rust off the front axle, I have many 
 times, never on a splittie.  how about ball joints breaking , doesn;t happen on 
 splitties  unless some dummie has put a bay front axle on it. They all have 
 their pros and cons . I personally don't own a bay I just work on them :) 
I do own 
&gt; 7 splitties and 2  WBX vanagons,one westy,and a sycro .   Bays ride better 
&gt; but only if you fix the seats , the splitties are way cooler and are for the 
&gt; most part easier to work on.   To each his own  later and have fun  Mark Dearing
