&gt; The highest horsepower motor VW ever put in a 
&gt; bus (up to 1979 anyway) was about 90 HP.  This was achived with the type-4 2.0 
&gt; fuel injected motor found in 75-79 buses.

Actually only 67hp for the FI 2.0L.  But a good bit of torque, 101 ft-lbs.

Of course the 914 and 411/412 versions had a bit more power I believe but
were not so torquey given their different missions.

&gt; And, as others have pointed out, buses were not designed for speeds over 75-
&gt; 80.  My owner's manual stated something like 77 MPH as the top speed.  The 

The owner's manual for the late Bus ('78, '79) says 75 mph.  That
seems about right and I don't even like driving it that fast.
