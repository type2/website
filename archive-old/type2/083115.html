Subject: Re: [T2] Proposed Engine Swap

This isn't exactly what you're asking, but keep this in mind. a 79 2
liter came from the factory w/ fuel injection. I have one &amp; it's
great. But it was designed to run w/ FI so I always question the
ability to put a single carb on an engine that was set to run FI. Just
something to keep in mind. Other more knowledgables can help w/ the
rest of the questions

&gt; tell from Wilson is that the mounting can be done.
