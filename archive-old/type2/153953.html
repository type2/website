Subject: Re: [T2] brake lights or lack

From Dave C. Bolen:

Karl,

Lordy, I just love the way that you get directly to the point!!!!

&quot;&gt; Buy 2 new switches. Remove the 2 old ones and admire the crap in the
 holes!&quot;

 What would we do without you!!!

 -------------------------------------------------------------------

Well it's the truth:)

I just saved the list a lot of bandwidth use because he would have written back &quot;What is all this crap in the
holes of my switches and master cylinder?&quot; and then we would have a long disertation about the hygroscopic
properties of mineral brake fluid and boiling temps of DOT 3 and DOT 4 and the silicone DOT 5 and why I like
Mercedes DOT 4+ fluid [because I get it for free] yada yada yada :)
