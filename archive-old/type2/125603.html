Subject: Re: [T2] Re: REALLY stupid Dipstick/Heat Question. 

Ahh, right on. That hasn't even gotten kinda sorta hot. Thanks for the reply. :) 

-------------- Original message -------------- 

&gt; If you can hold the dipstick by the little loopy 
&gt; handle without blistering your hand it's not too hot. 
&gt; I've found out that at about 250 degrees it is too hot 
&gt; to hold. 
&gt; IMHO
