Subject: Hard start and leaving for school
X-Diagnostic: MESSAGE REQUIRES APPROVAL

---------------------
Dilligad had this problem...I ran a heavy gauge wire from 
the positive side
of the starter into the engine bay to bypass the ignition 
switch.
---------------------
  Good basic concept. However, if you install a 12 VDC
&quot;hard start relay&quot; you get the same advantage without
risking life an limb (and your tie).
  With this installation you operate only a low amp draw
relay which shunts the more direct connection to your
starter. You use the key to activate voltage to energize
the relay. connected to the &quot;normaly open&quot; contacts on the
relay is your nice fat wire which is also a very short run
(2 feet?) direct from the battery to the starter instead of
all the way to the front of the bus and back... Make sure
your FLAPS supplied relay comes with wireing instructions
if you are not electrical... For the short, fat wire. I
would use a multi strand wire as opposed to single ... as
the multi strand wire will deal better with fatigue due to
movement.

  Going away to school? Take the F*rd. Sell it. put the
money in a safe place in the bus and use it for upkeep. You
can work on your bus at school in the lot. That Ford
probably requires the plug an play diagnostic routine where
it has to be hooked up to the dealer computer thing. $$$!
Also, You probably wont put that many miles on it while in
school anyway an you can use it as a great place to get
away for a while even if you dont leave the parking lot...
I do this at work alot. I eat my lunch out in das bus. If
you sell your bus you will regret it! Just ask Amy!

    Happy Holidays!

My dog is usually pleased with what I do, 
because he is not infected with the concept of what I &quot;should&quot; be doing.
