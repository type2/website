&gt;Well, initially, I thought the mixture was lean.  I have since had a co2

Was the co2 test done during hard acceleration (i.e. on a chassis dyno)?
If it was done at idle then you're just getting the idle mixture and not
the real mixture that you care about.

&gt;What is considered cooling off quickly.. When I'm at 250 on the highway and
&gt;slow down to around town driving, it probably takes 20 minutes (very rough
&gt;estimate) to cool back down to 210 or so...It never really will drop back
&gt;down to 180 unless it sits and gets that cool.

That's not quickly.  My oil temp will usually start to drop noticeably
within two or three minutes, although it may take 5-10 to level out.

&gt;Have you done a hot compression test?
&gt;
&gt;No.  What would that show?

The true compression.  I think what you really want is a *warm* compression
test.  Not hot, not cold.  Run the bus, let it sit for ten minutes, then do
the compression test.  Cold may show artificially low numbers, hot you risk
galling the spark plug threads.
