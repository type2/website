Subject: Quick Question Oil Cooler 16oo 1969

Hi Folks.

Just replaced the oil cooler in a 1600 and the 2 round
gaskets were different than the ones on the old oil
cooler.However so was the part of the oil cooler that
contacts them.  The new gaskets are just a simpe
cylinder opened on both ends, while the old one was
tapered. Can anyone tell me if this change is by
design before i put my engine back in.

Thanks 
Mick
