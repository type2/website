Subject: re: key code is where on cylinder? 

&gt;Howdy all,
&gt;
&gt;Where on the lock cylinder is the key code stamped???
&gt;
On the sliding door ,the easiest to get to, unscrew the inner handle and
pull the outer handle straight out there should be some numbers and letters
stamped on there.

BTW this is for a 73 or earlier with lock cylinder in the handle.  I have
never tried this on a 74 or after.
What year is the bus?
Peace

Snoopy
