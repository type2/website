Subject: Hella dual battery single relay kit wiring

I've read the archives extensively, but need a simpler explanation for how 
this setup works than I could find there.

Here's what I have:
1. 71 Westy 1600 with generator.  Weekend Warrior, garaged winters (I live in 
CT)
2. A spare battery from my other winter car, full of juice, but just sitting 
there
3.  The Hella single relay kit for charging auxillary battery.

Here's what I want:  
A second battery so I can run my stereo (currently wired for ignition on), 
and a lighter socket for small t.v., and other 12 volt accessories (currently 
wired always on) without getting stuck in the woods.

Here's what I want to know:
1.  If I install this relay, go camping, use the stereo, watch some t.v., and 
brew a small pot of coffee, where does the electricity come from after the 
first hour when my single battery would normally be run down, and how does it 
travel? (ie. map) Do I need to wire a seperate fuse panel for the devices I 
want to run? How would they work when I was driving normally, if I have them 
wired to the aux?

2.  On the instructions, terminal 87 seems to be the &quot;hot&quot; wire coming from 
the new battery.  There are then dotted lines, and an extra line with 
something called a 12/7s socket, and a mention of a single pole plug and 
socket.  This is where I'm getting thrown off.

3.  I read in the archives that you could use a terminal from the coil to 
energize the relay.  That way it would only be working when the engine was 
actually running. True?

I've spent almost 3 hours in the archives, I know what I am asking seems 
simple, and this subject has been beaten to death, but right now my bus is 
running better than ever, and I really just don't want to screw this up, for 
the sake of t.v's and fresh cofee.

Thanks, Don
