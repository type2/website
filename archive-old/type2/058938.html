Subject: Re: Oil Filter/Mexican Longblock

Look at the ads in DB&amp;HVW magazine -- get an external oil cooler,
adaptor plate to fit where the stock cooler went, and oil filter
adaptor. Probably should get a heavy duty oil pump as well.
The oil filter adaptor mounts anywhere you want (more or less) and it
all connects with hoses. I'd pay the extra bucks and get hoses with
permanent fittings, not the hoseclamp kind. NAPA and many other places
will custom make them to length for you, or you can just buy stock
lengths at Fleet-Farm. Get the plate style cooler, not the finned tube
ones.
