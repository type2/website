Subject: digital CHT guage from Dakota info need for the sending unit.

Hi volks,

I plan to buy a digital CHT guage from Dakota: SLX-11-1
they are going to add the additional length that I need to their sending unit (it is 14ft by default) to match my van,  for $25
Also the ring should be change to a 14mm ring.

- How long should be the thermocouple wire for a vanagon camper 1983 ? 17ft ?

I have never seen one of those, it looks like the thermocouple is composed of two mixed wires from a different metal.
- can I cut it myself and sold the wire on the ring directly like if it was a regular wire ? or should I treat both wire (metal) independently ?

- Is anyone know where to buy a 14mm ring out there, I could find too much info on the web.

I was thinking to buy a sending unit to VDO (because the ring size is correct) and extend the thermocouple wire all the way to the guage.
- Again same type of questions , since you have two different metal in the wire , is it possible to reattach two thermocouple wires.

Thanks

Chris
