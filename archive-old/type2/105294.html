Subject: Re: [T2] Two tire mounts

&gt; This has been bugging me for a few months and I finally found an answer:
 there are two spare tire mounts available, one from EMPI and one from
 BugPack...

There is a 3rd..... I don't know who made it. It mounts to the top of the bumper and only uses two little
holes on the nose about an 1&quot; and a half apart, up near the bottom of the emblem. All the weight of the tire
is on the bumper. The tire sits in the correct direction so you can put a hubcap on it. The tire is away from
the nose. It is not homemade. I found it on the front of a 73. If anyone wants pics of it, let me know. But I
have to find where I hid it.....
