Roland,

     Yes I have checked continuity &amp; I actually have it across all the wires
going across the window.  Is that a miracle or what?  I was changing the
window seal out this last weekend &amp; decided to check it out &amp; was amazed.

     I have never tried the repair paint available.  Would be a job for the
very patent.  Thanks for the response.
