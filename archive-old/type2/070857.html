Subject: Clutch Hub Hits Pressure Plate Hole
Message-ID: &lt;a9e0cf7c.24bc6063_at_aol_dot_com&gt;

Jeff this is exactly the problem I discovered with my new PP and Disk 
installation. My symptoms were vehicle trying to move with clutch pedal 
depressed and in gear.  It turned out my new Sachs disk was not machined on 
the outside of the hub so it could slide into the hole in the PP without 
contact.  I &quot;adjusted&quot; that myself and the problem went away. I don't know 
the specs for the outside of the hub but it should not contact PP hole.

forlorn and need rescuing.
