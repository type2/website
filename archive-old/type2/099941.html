&gt;Mine squeaks as it rubs against the seal that it slides through in the

There are two seals. A rectangular one that that goes under the mat and a round one that goes on the shaft of the brake and clutch pedal underneath the floor. I can't find any part numbers for the one that goes under the mat but I'd like to.

For the one under the floor, the original was 122 905 449 and the replacement is 211 721 387.  The replacement can be found at Bus Boys or www.oldvolks_dot_com. 

However, what came off my bus was 111 905 449. When I did a search on that number it came up as a Bosch part.  Another search said it was the spark plug air seal and sure enough the rubber is &quot;that&quot; shape.  Do you know what this means?  The corvair part probably won't fit. :-p
