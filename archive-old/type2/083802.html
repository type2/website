&gt; &gt; Here's a question though, with the new CV's (Lobro) how tight should
&gt; &gt; they be? Of the 4, two are that tight I cannot move the inner race
&gt; &gt; relative to the outer race at all by hand. The other two move quite
&gt; &gt; easily, but without any 'play'. Is that normal?
&gt;
&gt; Not normal. The two tighter cv joints will destroy
&gt; themselves if you run them very far.
&gt; Disassemble them and turn the races one ball in either
&gt; direction and reassemble, the flex will return to normal.

I think that the distinction here is between &quot;tight&quot; but movable CVs and
incorrectly assembled (locked) CVs,  If the CV can be moved (even with
some force) when new, it is not incorrectly assembled.  The use of dry
moly lubricants by the manufacturer can make new CVs very stiff until
they run a bit.  I've never received an incorrectly assembled new CV.
