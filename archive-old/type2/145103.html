Subject: Re: [T2] One version of why we are &quot;orphans&quot; of VW

Dude, I would be SOOO jealous if you had a Lancia Stratos. I want one sooo bad. Every time I see &quot;Legends of Motorsports&quot; come on Speed Vision with David Hobbs, they typically have a Lancia if it's one of the late 70s / early 80s rallys in Europe. I would kill for one of those. I hear you can buy a replica (that's done correctly, almost to the T) for around $20,000.  Maybe I should start saving???

My wife just bought a new beetle a year ago. She's been pretty happy with it.
She had a Jetta before that, a 2002 1.8T 5-Speed, it was in the shop 13 times in less than 25k miles. They reflashed the computer several times, things kept breaking... they couldn't get it to run properly and they finally de-tuned it. She had the 180hp version and they ended up installing the tune for the lower output 165hp Turbo one. It had so many problems that VW ended up buying it back. She then paid the difference in price between her Convertible Beetle, and what her 2002 1.8T Jetta cost new (which was like 3 grand). No problems so far.


When I dropped her off to pick up her new beetle, we drove our VW Bus. Everyone got soo excited when we pulled up in it, a couple of the service people came out of their booths to check it out.
I kind of expected this attention, which is the reason I did it... hehehe...

I got to talking to one of them, and they said that they no longer even have the tools to work on these vehicles anymore. Any special dealer service tools they might have had, they got rid of long ago. I asked them if they could do an alignment and they said they don't even have the proper programming / setup to do it with their computerized machine.

It is quite sad really.

I know that I can still take my 87 Pontiac Fiero, or my 81 Pontiac TransAm to any Pontiac dealership, and the people there are more than happy to work on it... AND have the tools to do so. It could be that maybe the cars aren't that much different than they are now??? I mean, VW has made a complete switch from air cooled / rear engined to water cooled / front engine. 

VW really is a whole different company now though...

&gt;&quot; I fear that you'd might as well own a Lancia or
&gt;&quot; Delorean when it comes to getting parts or service for it, given VW's recent

&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Yeah, it's a real b**ch gettin' parts for my Stratos... ;-(
