My two cents worth... :-)

I have a bugpak extractor and I &quot;had&quot; a bugpak muffler too (it lasted about
two months before it broke).  This is on a 74' type 4 motor.  I am now
running the same extractor and a dynamax muffler that a custom exhaust shop
help me setup.

My suggestion would either be stainless steel stock muffler (Bus Depot or OE
Vdub) or an S&amp;S extractor and the muffler of your choice via a reputable
shop.

My brother has the latter on his 77' ASI and its quiet and sturdy.

Hope this helps,

  If you've got a '78 then you should have a type 4. Up to 71 buses used an
  'upright' bug engine, 72 on used a 'suitcase' type 4 with the occasional
  upright being used in mostly european buses. Look under the hood, see a
big
  fan housing, ya got a upright, dont see a fan housing ya got a type 4. I
  doubt bugpack offers one for the type 4 but could be wrong. If they do let
  me know as I'll need a type 4 exhaust system soon too.

  &gt; What is a type 4 engine?
  &gt;
  &gt; I am looking at the &quot;Bugpack&quot; mufflers on Bowwow in Canada,
  &gt; since I am a Canadian, it seems a reasonable choice.
  &gt;
  &gt; Any reccommendations out there?
