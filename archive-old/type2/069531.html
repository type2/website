Subject: Re: Fuel system setup????

&gt;question is &quot;Is this a stock setup?&quot; I have been looking at the
&gt;price difference between the mechanical and electrical fuel pumps

No this is not.  My '74 had a mechanical fuel pump, which has been
replaced with an electric one.  Be glad, because mechanical fuel pumps
suck.  They don't break often, but if they do they are difficult to
replace.  The one on our buses are in a particularly hard place to reach.
the engine can stay in the bus, but it still is not anything I'd like to
ever do.

As far as switching back, look under the motor at the forward part of the
passenger side of the engine-there should be a pump attatched to the case,
or at least a cover plate where one used to be.  My bus still has the old
pump in place, with no hoses connected.  There is more gunk on it than on
the rest of the engine combined.  You might just need to buy a new pump
and reroute the fuel lines to be back to a mechanical pump system.
