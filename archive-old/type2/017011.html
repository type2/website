&gt; If you pushed the clutch to the floor, you WERE able to start the bus,
&gt; yes?
&gt;

Yes, but, since it was in Reverse, it lurched backward and died immediately.  I can
push the clutch pedal to the floor, it doesn't resist, and it does no clutching
function.

&gt;
&gt; If so, the clutch is NOT the culprit here.  Transmission related.  If you
&gt; tried to start the bus, and all it did was try to move (ie: clutch did not
&gt; disengage when pushed...) then I would look at either a frozen clutch
&gt; plate, or cable problems, etc..
&gt;
&gt; another check would be to just push the clutch in. No brake. Nose is
&gt; downhill, right?  The bus should start rolling.

No roll.  It used to be that I could sort of feel the clutch pedal resist and then
like something was engaging.  That doesn't happen now.


&gt; No? But you can start the
&gt; engine?

Yes, I can start the engine, but then it instantly dies since it's stuck in
Reverse.


&gt; Tranny.  Cant start the engine? clutch. (or both..)
&gt;

Uh... poop.  Now I know why Previous Owners are the target of such ridicule.  I
probably need a new transmission, then?  That's like the cost of just buying a bus
that works in the first place, right?
