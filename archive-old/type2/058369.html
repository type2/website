&gt; I was getting confused between a Voltage Isolator and a split charge

&gt; So, what exactly is a Voltage Isolator, is it just a bunch of diodes? 
As far as I know, it's functionally just a pair of diodes.  Each diode
allows current to flow from the generator to one of the batteries, but
not the other way.  This isolates the batteries from each other.  The
actual construction is probably several diodes in parallel on each
side, as the current is fairly large.

The bad news is that a diode requires a small voltage to allow current
to flow.  In order for your battery to receive the proper charging
voltage the generator has to put out that voltage _plus_ the voltage
drop of the diode.  The extra voltage is lost as heat, which is why
solid state isolators are contained in finned heat-sink housings. 

It must be
&gt; an American thing, as in the UK virtually all twin battery
installations are
&gt; done using a split charge relay, which disconnects the 2 batteries'
+ve terminals
&gt; when the ignition is off. Indeed, some more sophisticated
installations have an
&gt; arrangement whereby the current to 2nd battery is disconnected at
low alternator
&gt; output conditions (I think its wired via the warning lamp).

This low-output disconnection is a good idea, since hooking the relay
to the ignition brings the second battery on-line before the starter
does its job.  If the second battery is discharged, it will start
drawing current from the starting battery, which reduces the current
available to turn the starter.  This usually isn't much of a problem,
since VW engines are easy to turn, but could be a problem in cold
climates.  

&gt; Which brings us on to an interesting side issue.....I have my camper
electrics,
&gt; high power stereo, power windows, accessories socket, etc. all
connected to the
&gt; second battery, so that the electrics from the first battery are
more/less stock.
&gt; When I get on site, after a few days the second battery is almost
flat (I have a
&gt; colour TV as well), so I will occasionally 'borrow' additional power
from the
&gt; primary battery. Maybe its time for a third battery? Or a bigger
second battery?

More or bigger batteries would solve your problem, as well as making
the secondary battery last longer.  Lead-acid batteries don't like to
be discharged completely, which sounds like what you've been doing.

&gt; Should I go for the option of deep-cycle camping battery or stick
with a car one?

If you have the money to do so, the deep-cycle battery is good.  They
hold more energy and are designed to tolerate deep discharge better
than starting batteries.  Despite this, I don't use them and the
reason is simple economics.  Around here, you can get regular
batteries with a 5-year prorated warranty for around $40.  This is a
cost of about $0.66 a month.  A deep-cycle battery costs around $100
and is only warranted for 2 years, a cost of $4.17 a month.  Quite a
difference!  Another advantage to using a starting battery for the
camper is that you can easily jump yourself if you do something to
discharge the primary battery (leave the lights on or somesuch).  Most
deep-cycle batteries will be damaged by starting current.  I usually
put the new battery in the primary position and the old primary
battery in the camper position. That way, the fresher (and more
reliable) battery is the starting battery.

&gt; I have space for a third battery (just), should I just connect 2nd
and 3rd
&gt; batteries in parallel? Maybe an ammeter or two to watch what is
going where would
&gt; be a good idea (I already have voltmeters for each battery,
v_dot_useful!)?

Yes, they should go in parallel.  Another option is to use the big
batteries that used to be used in Ford pickups (or Diesel Mercedes,
for those on the eastern side of the Atlantic).  Ammeters are useful,
but are a pain to hook up, since they must be in the current path. 
Voltmeters are much easier to hook up and tell you pretty much the
same thing, as long as the battery itself is healthy.

One thing I've seen, but not yet experimented with is the use of the
battery ground strap as the ammeter shunt.  A wire is run from the
negative terminal of the battery, through a meter, and then to chassis
ground.  What you're really measuring is the voltage drop of the
ground strap which happens to be proportional to the current.  A very
elegant setup which combines the ease of voltmeter installation with
the definite information of an ammeter.  Unfortunately, I don't have
the specs of the meter used, but it was probably fairly sensitive.

&gt; I've been deliberately wooly here, I'm looking at encouraging
discussion on the
&gt; whole topic of additional electrical power.

And I seem to have played right into your hands!  :)
