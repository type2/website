Halon is being phased out due to environmental considerations.  If you
can find it, it is a great extinguishing agent, very clean, virtually no
residue.  Unfortunately it is very harmful to the ozone.

That leaves a good old ABC dry chemical extinguisher as the next choice.

&gt; Paul, Ive had real good luck with Halon, kills most any fire, and yes 
&gt; this is 
&gt; a case where bigger is better, get a 5pounder if you can. It's a 
&gt; real bitch 
&gt; to have a fire almost out and run out of agent.
