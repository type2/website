Subject: Re: [T2] It just died -Update 2-

Hello Oliver   First run you a jumper wire to your solenoid on the starter to 
the engine compartment so that you can touch the hot side of the battery to 
crank the engine, making sure the tranny is ouyt of gera and the e brake is on. 
 Now determine wheather you are getting spark and /or gas  Gas is the easiest 
spray some carb cleaner into a vacum port on the intake anywhere after the 
mass air fow meter to see if it fires up. then check for spark coming from the 
coil wire and /or the points.  Keep a fire extenguisher handy for safety sake.  
At this point you should know if it is fire or gas that is the problem.  You 
said that you have replced a lot of the electric and pump things BUT just 
because they are new don't mean that they are good.   Let us know where you are 
after doing these test  later and have fun  Mark Dearing
