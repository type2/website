Subject: [T2] spare tire

i was recently browsing through the archives on the subject matter of
the
spare tire mount on the front of the bus.

does anyone have pictures of what a spare tire mount looks like when
attached to the bumper?  i just recently bought a replacement for the
missing mount for my '75 westy.  there are plenty of holes in the sheet
metal w/ gaskets where the mount once existed (that have been painted
over...but let's not get into that one.)

i was considering using the new mount, but just placing it lower, so
most
of the weight of the spare would be on the bumper and not the sheet
metal.  then i could put the front emblem back where it belongs.

how does this look?  is it safe?  will the bolts shear through the
metal?  can i put some reinforcing on the &quot;inside&quot; metal of the bus?
what
is the average air speed velocity of a swallow?

thanks volks
