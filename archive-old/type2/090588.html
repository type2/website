&gt;   Of course my Snap-On torqur wrench could be off being it's over 20 years
&gt; old and I have never had it recalibrated.

Snap-on is good, but I'll bet it is torqueing low by now.

It's easy to check, though, to make sure that it is in the ballpark.

To check, you need a scale (bathroom is OK, one that can weigh 20 pounds
more accurately is better), a bucket, water, and a tape measure.

First, weigh the torque wrench.

Second, clamp the square drive of the wrench in a vise.  The handle should
extend horizontally.

Set the wrench to the desired torque.

Measure from the middle of the square drive to a convenient point on the
handle.  For me, the middle of the handle was 16 inches (1.33 feet) from
the drive. Mark this point.

Hang a bucket from the handle at the marked point and pour water into the
bucket until the wrench clicks or the desired reading is seen.  Don't let
the bucket fall!

Weigh the bucket.  If you are using a bathroom scale, weigh yourself with
and without the bucket and take the difference.

Add the weight of the bucket to half the weight of the wrench.  Multiply
the sum by the length previously measured in _feet_.  This is the torque
being applied by the wrench and should match the setting.  Mine was 14
ft-lb when set at 19 ft-lb, which is way off!

I am suspect of the accuracy of 10-150 ft-lb range wrenches in the lower
end of their range.  I plan to get a lighter wrench that will be more
accurate in this range.
