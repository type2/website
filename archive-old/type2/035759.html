Subject: 34 PDSIT -2/3 adjustments

        Can anyone help me adjust my dual carbs on my 1700 type IV in a '73
bus????? I've read the stuff in the &quot;library&quot; and searched the archive, read
the tech articles...read my Bentley... and all is still not well.
        It seems that plugs 3 and 4 get covered in black soot while 1 and 2
remain clean. It also idles a little rough and backfires every now and then,
especially when you let the throttle off.
       I basically have a new motor,  rebuilt the carbs, including having
the throttle plates rebushed. I run an electric fuel pump set at 2 psi . I
adjusted the volume control screws 2 1/2 turns, have given the idle mixture
screw 2 turns out  and I think I have adjusted the throttle valve opening
properly, maybe. ( On page 15 of the Fuel section in Bentley, they refer to
a closing gap in figure 5-11. Am I wrong to assume that this &quot;gap&quot; is the
distance from the throttle valve  to the edge of the throttle plate? Because
I measured that gap with a straight edge and set my gap on my 2 carbs this
way).  I syncronized the 2 carbs so they both flow equally.

The questions...

1. As previously stated, why do plugs 3&amp;4 get sooted up while plugs 1&amp;2
remain clean, even though I have both carbs supposedly set-up the same way?

2. What screws should I adjust?

3. Is 2 psi on my fuel line too high or too low?

4. Have I set-up  my throttle valves properly? If not, what should I do?

5. I didn't replace the floats when I rebuilt the carbs (mainly because no
one locally had them - not part of the kit). They both had a slight
indentation where the needle valve contacts it. Is this enough to keep the
valve open, and thus, flood the carb?

6. While I'm at it, what's the proper gap for the exhaust valve - .006 or
.008?

Any help would be appreciated. I have been workin on this rebuild for 4
months now - been drivin' the wife's truck and she wants it back!
