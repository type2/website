Subject: Missing distributor spring

Well, Chris, I don't know how generic those distributor springs are, but knowing those germans I suspect that the same spring is good for many years of distributor.... Anyway, Jim happened to run across a spare spring the other day, when picking thru his VW goodies (he also found a nice 30 year old NOS distributor cap!).  I think it came off a distributor for our old '68 bus.  If you think you can use it, we'll be happy to send it.
