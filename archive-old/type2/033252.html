*************************first one***************************

&gt;Way back last year sometime, one of the T2 listees went on
&gt;a hunt for that plastic edging that goes around the furniture 
&gt;on Westies.  As I recall, the person said they located a place
&gt;that not only sold in bulk for cheap, but one could get the
&gt;trim in a variety of colors. 

That would be Outwater Plastics Industries  1-800-631-8375

http://www.outwater_dot_com

They'll send you a free catalog about an inch and a half thick.
The T-molding comes in 250 foot rolls, minimum.  They've got all
kinds of other stuff, from doorknobs to two foot high statues of
Michelangelo's &quot;David.&quot;  I got the catalog for the T-moulding, but
wound up buying a thousand bucks worth of halogen light fixtures,
transformers, and touch dimmers for my house!

The Woodworkers' Store (800)279-4441 - 24 hrs a day

Plastic T-molding - 12 foot roll is $4.99, 100 foot roll is $24.99
                                      3/4&quot; wide.

                                      12 foot roll is $6.49, 100 foot roll is 
$24.99
                                      13/16&quot; wide

Both widths come in tan, brown, black, and white. The catalog
says the 3/4&quot; width is for plywood, and the 13/16&quot; width is for
laminated sheet goods. I think the 3/4&quot; width is probably what
you want. You will also need a slot cutter for a router to cut the
groove to install the T-molding. They sell these also for a 1/4&quot;
shank router.

48876 for a 1/16&quot; kerf (for 3/4&quot; molding) - $24.99
95332 for a 5/64&quot; kerf (for 13/16&quot; molding) - $26.99

The part numbers for black 3/4&quot; T-molding are 27201 &amp; 91728
for the 12 ft and 100 ft respectively.

Prices were from my Fall 1997 catalog. Order a catalog before 
you buy and you will see a picture and the same description as
above.

we have just about comp;eted a full restoration of a 1971 Westy.  Its a
real beauty.  Were having a heck of a time locating replacement plastic
&quot;T&quot; molding for the finishings of the various laminate cabinets.  Any
ideas out there would be appreciated.
