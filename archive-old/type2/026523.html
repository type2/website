Subject: RE: Obsessing on Dizzy, 009 timing (how far to set advance)
Message-ID: &lt;D3C18AEA0EA1D111B8DA00805F85E889011F8F8F_at_dsntexsrv3.diasham_dot_com&gt;

&gt;Not so -- that's more like what it should be for a T1 upright engine, not
&gt;a T4. The T4 needs to have a total advance of 40-43 degrees at about 
&gt;3500 rpm.  34 degrees is not even near enough, and not even remotely 
&gt;dangerous.

Gotta disagree with that one.  An 009 will hit max advance way below 3500
(ie about 2700 - 2800).  I don't know what the advance curve is with a stock
dizzy, but every long-term bus and/or 914 mechanic I've talked to is
emphatic that anything over 32 degrees with an 009 is a no-no.  I've been
running mine on my dual-Weber-ed 1.7/1.8 hybrid (don't ask) for 8
years/70,000 miles and I know it is right.  

Anyone else want to offer an opinion, cold-hard fact, or experience on this
issue?  It is important enough that the person who asked the original
question needs a correct answer since the wrong one could destroy his
engine!
