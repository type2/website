Subject: SOGGYBUS?  FEAR NOT!

If you're still sitting on the fence about weather (pun intended) or not
to come out for EveryBus, rest easy.  All predictions are favorable, the
local forecast is calling for sunny/partly cloudy with highs in the mid
to high 70s, Friday through Sunday.

So come out for the Chili contest, come out to see all kinds of buses
from far flung places, come out to see Roy's amazing Awn-O-matic, or
simply to see the bus that was good enough for Chris to finally buy, but
just come out!

See you there...
