&gt;Any idea where to look for one?

The CA Bureau of Automotive Repair will provide a list
of dealers that sell antique smog parts.  If you cannot
find the part at these places, you could get an exemption
to your smog test.  

*Call the parts locator to get your client number and the
phone numbers of part dealers.

*If you can't find the part at the parts dealers, call the
parts locator back and explain that the part is not found.
They will ask for your client number and send you a letter
stating these facts.

*Take the letter to the smog referee to get an exemption
to the smog test.


CA Bureau of Auto Repair Smog Referee (800)622-7733

CA BAR Smog Parts Locator (800)826-3566

Obsolete smog parts dealer's numbers:
HELP(800)544-4357
Economy (800)327-1449
$49.95 Smog Parts (800)577-4995
Unique Imports (714)951-5201
Specialized Auto (800)398-4985

The parts dealer's prices are outrageous.  Use them to get
a waiver or as a last resort.  Try the junkyards or fix the
old part if you can.
Good luck,
