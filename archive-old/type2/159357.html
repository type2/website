Subject: wipers

Gosh, I thought the wiper circlip removal was easy. you're talking about 
the tiny one at the tip (FIF)??  just pry it off with a small 
screwdriver and don't let it fly away.

I had wiper issues for a long time and stopped by an old-timer's shop in 
Canon City CO in July.  He said, duh, all you need to do is lube the 
shafts, they get seized up after they're dry for a while.  And I always 
thought it was a bad motor or switch!!! 

so I removed the wiper blades, then once the tiny circlips (near 
invisible ones near the tip) are removed then the shaft will freely (or 
not depending on how dry it is) push back into the bronze bushing it 
rides in.  don't push all the way in, we can leave the assembly in the 
bus and the wiper transmission will basically hold it together.  one of 
my shafts was really tight so I put the outer nut back on (to protect 
the threads) and gave it a few light taps inward.  once you free the 
shafts all they need is a little anti-seize, work it back and forth (in 
and out) in the bushing till it's all greased up.

This made a WORLD of difference, now I know why my wipers were binding 
up, now they are free to wipe!! I bet this has happened to a lot of old 
wiper shafts but I haven't ever seen it mentioned on the list.

Oh yeah, now I live in a desert where it hasn't rained in the 2 months 
I've been here. . . :)

Hope that helps somebody, if you haven't ever done it, it's an easy job.

&gt; &gt; Where I'm at now, is trying to get the the one good
&gt; &gt; thread from the one assembly, and trying to put it
&gt; &gt; on the other assembly.  The problem is, I can't
&gt; &gt; figure out how to get this darn circlip off to
&gt; &gt; remove the shaft.  Does anyone know how I would go
&gt; &gt; about getting this small part off?  If you don't
&gt; &gt; know what I'm talking about, it's a small washer
&gt; &gt; like piece holding the smaller shaft in a larger
&gt; &gt; tube.  Any suggestions?   I'm aiming to get it off
&gt; &gt; with out destroying it.  I may just end up buying a
&gt; &gt; new one from a parts bus.  Thanks in advance.
