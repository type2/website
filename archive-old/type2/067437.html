Subject: transmission leak on 75 Deluxe

Today I was under my van replacing the clutch cable and noticed that there
was a lot of fluid and drips on the shaft that goes into the transmission
from the front of the bus, and also some around the immediate area.  Is there
a way to check if something is screwed up?  Maybe a seal gone bad?  Is there
a way to check fluid level?  Forgive me for my stupidity, I am new, and I
have sinned by not purchasing a Bentley.  On my X-mas list...

thanks
