&gt;(1) It appears I have to take the rear braces loose in order to get the

&gt;loose I can't hold the roof up, so I can't remove or install anything at
&gt;all.
&gt;
&gt;I'm reckoning the rear corners are the last thing you do, and it's done
&gt;with two people, one holding the roof up. Is this correct?
As someone pointed out, a 2x4 in the middle rear of the poptop is good
for propping the top up.  Also a sturdy cardboard box.  When installing,
center the canvas at the front and back at the top and staple to the wood.
Do the front and back first, then the sides, gathering extra canvas to the
corners.  Then install the metal strips, same order (front and back,
sides).

&gt;(2) How do other people take all these damnable staples out? Just
&gt;screwdrives and pliers and patience, or is there a better way?
A better question would be how do you get the new staples IN.  Stapling
the canvas to the wood is no problem but then stapling on the plastic is
another matter:  That plastic is TOUGH!  I forget the size of staples I
was using, but I think they were of the recommended size (in the
instructions that came with the new canvas), and the staple gun was a
heavy-duty Craftsman (non-air/electric), set to the &quot;power&quot; mode, and the
staples bent or at best remained out about about 1/16&quot; from flush.  Then
I noticed the instructions said &quot;staple or tack the plastic strips back in
place&quot;.  Tack is the key word here.  I used #16-13/16&quot; blued tacks (in
clear little box, red/black/white label, from Tower Co., available hung
from pegboard hooks at most hardware stores).  I know:  Like anyone cares!
But these WERE really good tacks and seemed ideal for this job:  nice and
sharp, just the right size and didn't bend a one (tapping them in with a
small hammer).  I would definitely recommend this as the way to go when
installing the plastic unless you've got some power stapler.
