Subject: Re: RESCUE THIS VAN.

I'm confused. It's usually the liberal environmentalists that are
trying to get rid of our old vans. When did the Republicans start
doing this?

&gt;  I saw this in todays paper 10/31.
&gt; 
&gt; &quot;In an effort to draw contrasts between Democratic Sen. Paul Wellstone and 
&gt; Republican challenger Rudy Bochwitz, the Republican Party began a tour Wednesda
&gt; of parts of Minnesota, hauling a dilapidated 1967 Volkswagen van around with a 
&gt; tow truck.
&gt;   The van, Party Chairman Chris Georgacas said, represents the &quot;failed ideology
&gt; of Paul Wellstone' and like Wellstone, 'is on its last axle.'  He said the van 
&gt; will be towed through southern and northwestern Minnesota, the heart of 
&gt; Republican strength in the state, for three days.&quot;
&gt; 
&gt; O.K. folks now I am pissed.  The van is a nice old splittie that looked in 
&gt; pretty good shape and was running just a few months ago when they were going to
&gt; drive it around the state.    Failed? The thing ran for nearly 30 years before 
&gt; the Rebulicans got ahold of it and blew it up. Now they are going to parade the
&gt; body around the state like some sort of gruesome war treasure.  I hope my buddy
&gt; Paul kicks ass on these guys Tuesday. I also hope that someone can get ahold of
&gt; the poor van victim and give it life again.  Maybe they will be so depressed 
&gt; after Tuesday they will just give it away to someone (me?), because it holds so
&gt; many bad memories.  Hmmmmm.  Chris. Oh, Chris!
