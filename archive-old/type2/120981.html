Mike, I would just use a wire wheel on your grinder. I've used this for all
my con rods, my case studs, PR tubes in the past. It works fast and does a
good job. Don't spend money for anything fancy, I always have a 6: wire
wheel on one side of my grinder and it works great!!!

Well, the blasting is free, but the pitting is what I was afraid of. I
think I'll take your idea though and go get a 3m wheel to stick on the
grinder and just buff all the crap off. It seems like 3M's also got
some alternatives to wire brush wheels. I didn't want to spend a whole
lot of time on this, but at the same time I didn't want to put them back
in the engine all cruddy when I've cleaned the rest of the engine ;)
 
thanks,
Mike

&gt; I used a 3m Paint wheel. Cleans well and is low impact.
&gt; May even be cheeper then blasting.
