Subject: nice 72 westy available _at_ft.meade (not mine )

so im over on the other side of post, picking up some film for a photoshoot 
tonight (i do a bit of photography here and there) when i able over to the 
lemonlot in the px parkinglot to see if there are any benzes or acvws (not 
that i should be looking, i have way too many projects going) when i saw 
this 72 westy. no rust that i could see. really good conditions outside, 
good condition inside (i saw a few small cracks in vinyl, nothing big 
though. id give this bus a 7.5-8 outta 10 . looking in the engine hatch, 
though, i saw they had installed a pre-72 upright engine in place of the 
pancake engine. the sign said $2000 as is, i dont know if the guys willing 
to negotiate though. if anyones interested, id be more than happy to look 
into this bus some more.
