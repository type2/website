Subject: Re: [T2] front-seat headrests

  &gt;Has anyone added headrests to the front seats of a '73 kombi?

If you're not fussed about keeping it stock you should consider 
putting in new seats with headrests. You could also consider 
replacing your seat belts with webbing grabber types that I believe 
you can get in NZ but are not available here in Oz! :(

Cheers,

Martin.
