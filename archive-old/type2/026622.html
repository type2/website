Subject: Hesitation on acceleration

Hey Volks, 

My recently rebuilt 77 2.0 liter FI engine hesitates slightly when I
accelerate, then surges strongly. Once under way, it runs fine and is very
responsive. Also I can detect a very occasional miss when the bus is idling,
which may or may not be related. What is going on here?
