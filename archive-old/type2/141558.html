Subject: RE: [T2] Alternator cooling boot

&gt; Since reproing this item in January 2004, (VWG/Airhead Parts) 
&gt; has sold 263 of these with nary a peep about &quot;hard-to-fit&quot; or 
&gt; &quot;doesn't fit&quot; from the shops that we mainly supply to 
&gt; (including Bus Depot).
&gt; 
&gt; A few calls to stores &amp; installing shops this afternoon that 
&gt; have bought large quantities of this boot for feedback 
&gt; yielded no complaints, so I am at a loss to explain the cause 
&gt; of Troy's problem (Too late in the afternoon to call Bus 
&gt; Depot, so Ron, chime in here if you have any feedback from
&gt; customers) or to offer a solution.


We haven't had any problems at all with the VWG repro.
