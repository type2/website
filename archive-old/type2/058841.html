Quoth &quot;David S. Severance&quot; &lt;sevy_at_conknet_dot_com&gt;:

&gt;  Am looking for side vent window frames with good seals (have glass)
&gt;  for
&gt; '71 transporter.  Apparantly the seals are no longer available and
&gt; according to WCM &quot;will be unavailable for ????&quot;  My frames are all
&gt; shot.

FWIW, I'm looking at a pretty recent Wolfsburg West catalog that 
lists the rubber in both deluxe (w/trim groove) &amp; standard varieties. 
 It shows the vent wing seal as 221 847 673A, &quot;left or right&quot;.  The 
p/n for the main window seal varies according to 
middle/rear/left/right/std/deluxe.

I'd be interested in learning more about the window and vent wing 
removal procedure for this assembly from anyone who's done it.  My 
vent wing frame is toast, too -- got my eye open for a good used 
one....
