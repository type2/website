Hey Bob,

I've got a 78 and was wondering a few things about the
gas shutoff you mentioned.  Where is it, on the tank
or inline somewhere?  Where did you find it?  I've
looked in a bunch of places but nobody seems to know
what a petcock is.  They think I'm trying to make a
bad joke or something, I just get blank stares.  The
next place I was going to look was a motorcycle repair
shop because non of the auto parts stores around here
(Arlington, VA) have a clue.

As far as your bus missing goes, I had a similar
problem with mine but it would actually cut out and
then fire again.  It only happened at highway speeds
and then it started happening any time the bus was
moving.  Of course I instantly knew that it was an
ignition problem so I replaced the points/condensor
which of course didn't do anything.  I started the bus
and checked the double-relay and when I poked the
double-relay the bus choked and died.  The ground wire
for the double-relay was held in place by the
double-relay which was screwed into the firewall. 
When the screw worked itself loose, no ground and no
more juice for the fuel pump.  Apparently it vibrated
enough at speed that it cut out but not at idle.  Go
figure.  Installed a bigger, badder screw and voila!
no more problems.

Bob J.
