Subject: Oil smell in heater?
Message-ID: &lt;0.d8eacd8e.25414c6c_at_aol_dot_com&gt;

After blowing oil all over my heater boxes due to a damaged piston, it is now 
very hard to ride with the windows up. The smell of hot oil engulphs the 
interior. 
  I guess i'm just here to see if anybody has had any success in removing 
this smell. The first thing i though of was to spray engine degreaser as far 
inside there as i can and swish it around. The boxes arent in that bad of 
shape, but they are showing age. I really dont want to have to purchase some 
new ones, but would like to be able to comfortably use what heat i can get.
