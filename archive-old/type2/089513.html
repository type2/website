Subject: Re: [T2] this is just wrong!

&gt; Well, I question the claim of 175mph regardless of how they measured it.
&gt; small, slippary cars need a lot of power to reach such speeds, a bus would
&gt; need a lot more.

This guy lives about 40 miles from me. I was driving on the 401 towards Niagara
Falls a couple years ago in my '77 doing about ~70 mph when this bus passed me
like I was standing still, he was doing well over 100 mph....

That was before the body mods when it was a purple westfalia with the pop-top!!
Go here to see a picture of it before:

Second row, second bus in...

I dont doubt its speed at all, it was built for racing....its something to
see....

Collie (still wondering why, too...)
