Glenn,

Yes, it was a sanden 508.  I have lots of pics of it that I will post as 
soon as I get a free moment.  I have NAPA part number for the connectors 
that I used and will post them at the same time.

The sanden should have a certain type of &quot;head&quot; on it in order to fit 
under the tin, but you should be able to purchase one that way....maybe 
Ron at BD has the &quot;more&quot; correct ones now.

Honest guys, I am trying...other cars just  seems to be getting in the 
way!

Cheers, dave

&gt; I have my A/C sitting in my Utility Room waiting for me to do the necessary

&gt; Then I can start installing the A/C.  In looking at the installation
&gt; pictures on http://www.shockwaverider_dot_com/78busac/, I do have a few
&gt; questions.  I assume that a Sanden SD508 was used?  If so, what adapter did
&gt; you get for the hoses?
