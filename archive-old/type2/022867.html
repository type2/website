Several months ago, I got a call from Richard and Gayle Millar who were 
travelling throughout America in their recently acquired for the trip 
1978 Westy.

It was luck that I was home in as much as I was departing for Malaysia 
the very next day.
Richard said that he was having a bit of trouble with the bus, and 
wondered if I might be in a position to look the bus over and maybe 
sort out a few areas in question.
It was a fun afternoon to go through their bus, and be able to help in 
a few matters.

At the end of the day, I posted to the list information about them, and 
invited list members to E-mail them so that they might have backup 
friends who could assist them with local help resource info if they ran 
into trouble during their trip.

As it turns out, the list response was pretty amazing.

Richard and Gayle stopped by yesterday to say hello and goodbye now 
that their wonderful trip is over.

And what a trip it was !!!! ...........
Of all that they saw and did, they felt that it was the bus list people 
that they met that really made their trip as wonderful and memorable as 
could ever be !!!

Yeah, you're a great group, and I'm really proud to be a part of y'all !!
