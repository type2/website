Howdy everyone!

I am still in internal turmoil about what I want out of a bus. I have been
looking for a clean rust free camper instead of the filthy rusty camper I
have now. Bill Lobsitz did an outstanding job finding a very straight rust
free ASI camper. I am leaning towards that bus but I will need to tow it
home and I am not real thrilled about that prospect. I also prefer the wider
upper bunk in the westfalia's over the narrow poptop on the ASI bus. 

To get to the point I am going to take one more look at finding a poptop
westfalia that is rust free and straight. The condition of the interior is
not a big concern. I would like to be able to drive it to Utah. If anyone
knows of such a beast I would like to hear about it.

Thanks
Clay
