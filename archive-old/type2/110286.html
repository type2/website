Subject: BN4 heater

Does anyone have or can get a picture of the wiring on their bn4 heater, 
Imine is not running right and I want to check the wiring. What causes the fan to 
pick up speed, or why would it start out fast and not pick up speed, and keep 
blowing fuses. 
Story is I ran this heater on the bench seemed fine so installed in our bus, 
and the fuel pump wouldn't run so eventually, cleaned the points on the fan 
then the pump would run but the fan seems to run fast before the heater actually 
fires up then if you turn off the switch and the heater should run to cool 
down it just shuts down completely, any ideas, thanks its getting cold in 
Buffalo NY.  Dylan
