Subject: Followup on burning oil

My first rebuild will have lasted 1350 miles. R.I.P. first rebuild.

Something went wrong with #3 piston pin clips. Maybe two were
installed instead of one ? Maybe it did not clip right in. A mess
happened in the pin area, grinding on the cylinder wall on both sides.
There is then enough room for plenty oil to go get burned in the
combustion chamber. Next time I will assemble alone, whithout trying
to cheer up a friend at the same time !!

I am getting the second new P&amp;C set for this rebuild... I'm glad I did
not burn a more expensive 1776 or 1900cc set of P&amp;C.

Antonio and I are getting better at pulling engines : it took us 1h50
minutes to pull engine and dismantle until the piston pin. That is
after 2 T4 and 2 T1 R&amp;R in two months.
