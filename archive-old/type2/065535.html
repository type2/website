Subject: Found the REAL Starting problem.

hey now,

well, i've found the real problem with the '77s starting woes.

first, i had installed a bosch wr-1 relay kit and that worked for about a day.
then it wouldn't start again.

then i tested the starter by shorting it out. the engine cranked.

i drank a beer.
checked all the connections of the relay kid.

drank another beer.

went to start the engine again and nothing happened. looked under dash at
wires. fiddled with the two main ones going to the ignition switch. tried
to start the engine again. started. apparently there is a short somewhere from
where the wires go up the column to the ignition switch.

but it'll start every time now if you wiggle them wires.

any ideas on fixing this?
