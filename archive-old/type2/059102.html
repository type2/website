Subject: Oil Pressure Too High??

I'm helping a friend get an engine running and it looks like the oil
pressure is way too high.  Its a later dual relief 1600 case and has an
aftermarket oil pump and oil filter.  The engine is blowing a steady
drip drip drip out of the flywheel oil seal.

Pulled the relief valve from the crank pulley end of the engine and it
was quite scored, cannot get the other relief valve out of the cylinder.

If the relief valve(s) are stuck in the high position would this cause
the high oil pressure?  I had an uncalibrated gauge connected and it
showed about 60psi at idle. (if the nominal is 28 or so, you can see my
concern.)

please p-mail me as I am on digest mode and the work is going on
tonight.

Thanks
