Subject: RE: Odd question, How much hp does it really take (a/c
  question)

I would speculate that the 1.5 HP figure for the rotary compressor is the
shaft power required to drive the compressor at its' rated pressure and
flow - that's how the industrial compressors that I deal with are usually
rated.  If you are considering running the AC compressor from an electric
motor driven by your bus's electrical system, consider how the numbers will
shake out.

Assuming that the 1.5 HP figure is correct/realistic, an electric motor
providing that much power at 12 volts will draw 116 amperes continuously
(assuming 80% efficiency of the motor).  I calculated this as follows: (1.5
HP X 746 watts/HP)/(.8 efficiency X 12 V).  Your bus can only put out 30
amps continuously ('71 or earlier with a generator) or maybe 50 amps or so
if it has an alternator.  So this electrical load, if applied for any length
of time, will run down your battery even with the engine running and the
charging system operating normally.  I.e., not a practical way to run an AC
compressor.  Plus, I've never seen a 2 HP 12 V DC motor, but I bet it would
be a monster!

The power to get a motor started is not usually thought of in terms of
horsepower, but rather, the torque the motor must produce and the resulting
current it must draw, in order to break away from stop and accelerate to
rated speed. This starting current can be expected to be in the range of 2
to 3 times the rated full load current for a DC motor, higher (like, 6 times
full load current) for an AC induction motor).  All the more reason why
running an AC compressor from an electric motor in your bus is not
practical.

Message-ID: &lt;20021115041924.49099.qmail_at_web80302.mail.yahoo_dot_com&gt;

Hello List,

I have an odd question that keeps bugging me. I
understand that the old YORK compressors found on many
older a/c units required around 6-7hp to opperate.
According to some spec sheets that I saw in the past,
the rotary style compressor used to replace the YORK
only requires 1.5hp to opperate. That being said,
would it be possible to run one of these rotary
compressors using a 2hp electric motor? Am I missing
somthing here? Yes, I know that is an odd question but
it has been bothering me. The 1.5 hp rating, Does that
include the energy needed to start turning the
compressor or is that just the energy needed to keep
the compressor turning or does it not make any
difference? ANy thoughts on this would be appreciated.
Thanks again!
