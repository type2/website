Duh. Sorry didn't read the first question. I think you're referring to the
short cable which controls the dash/under floor vent, not the control boxes
on the heat exchangers, though I still think it needs to be a stiff wire.
Just Kampers doesn't list this. I repaired  mine with a length of stainless
steel wire, though I just happened to be doing a job at a wire drawers at
the time. Not sure where you'd get it otherwise.
