Subject: Re: [T2] spare tire location on a 73 bus

If yours is a 9 passenger it is under the front seat.  I have always seen 7
passenger (walk though) with the tire in back.

I have seen most busses with spare tire wells in the back of the bus, mine
does not have one.  Where is the STOCK spare location on a plain jane 73
bus?
