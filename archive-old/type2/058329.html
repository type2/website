Subject: Dual Carb Troubles

	I recently put a new engine in my bus, its a '73 manual with dual
carbs. New engine is a 2000cc beastie, everything else is original.  Well
any way, I haven't been able to get a nice smooth idle yet.  When I pulled
the plugs and checked then the drivers side were pretty normal looking,
although they showed slight signs of being to lean.  The ones on the
passenger side were so fouled with carbon deposits, its a surprise they
even fired.
	I cleaned, regapped and installed them.  The timing, ignition and
spark systems seemed alright.  the  carbs are balanced at high rpms.  The
idle speed is right.  The exuast smells rich though and when it runs you
can hear that it kinda, well I don't know how to describe it, smooth for a
second and then a loud chuff type noise(?).  The rpms stay pretty steady.

Lastly I checked the mixture screws at the base of the carbs.  The left
one was slightly flattened and the right was new looking.  I can't get
these thing around here.  Anyone know where I can get them?  Also the
&quot;disconnect the idle cutoff solenoid&quot; thingy in Bentley won't work because
they have been replaced with non solenoid G55 jets.  

Anyone know how to balance these things or where to get a cheap CO tester?
Any sugesstions on balancing?  Anything? I am about to chuck these things
and save up for a single progessive Weber.
