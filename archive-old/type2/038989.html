Alrighty Volks Friends...
  My 68 bus has louvered windows in the mid section. I was thinking of replacing them with solid windows, but that may put a damper on ventilation. Does anyone know if there are pop-out window kits available for baywindow buses?
  BTW, I want to thank everyone for their input on the compatibility of Empi wheels on a baywindow. I recalled shortly thereafter that when I bought the bus (in my excitement I kinda forgot) the PO told me that the suspension was replaced with a 72-73 suspension.

Peace &amp; Harmony
