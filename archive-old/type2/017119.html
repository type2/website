  Depending on the situation you might have a leg to stand on...radar is
a very dispersed signal and so cannot pinpoint objects the way the new
ladar (laser) systems can.  So, if a cop turns his radar gun on at a
band of three cars coming at him all in their own lane, he has no idea
which target he as actually clocking car1, car2 or car3.  He can guess
he is getting the &quot;biggest&quot; target but that is only a guess.  Similarly,
if you are driving your bus and a giant semi truck is behind you it is
possible that the semi is what gets clocked not you because the semi has
so much more reflective area, but again no way for the cop to know for
sure..  Of course, in reality I have found that judges are never amused
by this technical mumbo, jumbo (even if it is the truth) and generally
accept that if the cops radar gun says 80mph then you were going 80mph
even if the cop was incorrectly using his gun.  The
&quot;my-bus-can't-even-do-80&quot; argurment reminds me of my explanation for
running a red light in my '72 westy.  The light turned yellow at just
the wrong time and I didn't feel I could safely stop my heavy bus in
time so I floored it hoping to get through the light in time, but of
course we all know how effective flooring the westy is....given two poor
choices I tried to convey the idea that I chose the best choice.
Actually a better arguement would have been that had I not been driving
an old westy (but say a ford Taurus) I probably wouldn't have even been
pulled over cause all the cop really wanted was to make a big drug bust
and what better target than a kid in a westy.  That's another story
though...
