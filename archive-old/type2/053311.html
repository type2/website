Dave:  I got your message loud and clear.  Do you think that I could remove 
the pads (sand them, or buy new) and, with the pads removed, apply brake 
cleaner to the rotors and calipers?

Could I apply the brake cleaner WITHOUT removing the new pads and see if 
this does the trick?  Would this be harmful to the pads?  Any other opinions 
about this out there?

Thanks to all.
