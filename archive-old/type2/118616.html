Subject: fuel filter location for carbureted engines

Hi all. I missed the start of the thread, so for give me if I double up on
previous comments.
I have run fuel filters both before and after the pump on my VW's (dual carb
type 4 kombi's and beetle's). I have carefully bled filters to eliminate air,
but they always end up with air in them if they are mounted in such a way that
air can be trapped in them.
My preference now is to only run a filter after the pump and mount the filter
vertical so they self bleed and don't collect air again.
The only problem I have experienced with trapped air is if it's on the
pressure side, it does leave the needle and seat in the carb under pressure
when you turn off and can allow the carb to flood slightly when turned off as
the air expands (ever so slightly as it's only ~4psi).
Mounting the filters vertical also means they will trap water without
clogging.
