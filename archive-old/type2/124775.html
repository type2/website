Bills Timetable

Sunday Left Jerome. Stayed night at Canyon Point (?) Campground, took
shower, ate chili. Said he woke up during the night and couldnt see
anything out the back window. I blew it off as being a dark night in the
forest. Could have had a small stroke that night.

MondayHad breakfast at the Canyon Rim Cafi in Heberpancakes. No problems
and had a good ride to Silver. Had wanted to have lunch in Cliff but
restaurant closed. Ate at the Wendys east of town.  Arrived home 4PM.
Joined me in the hot tub and told me all about ELF, Jerome, the man who
snored, Theo and the endless bong, drinking Mickeys, seeing Rex and Ron,
and CO contingent. Had some roast chicken, went to the Fountain for Im Not
Scared. which we both enjoyed.

TuesdayWoke about 5, had a bowel movement, cleared his throat and felt a
pain in his left chest and down his arm. Thought it was gas. By 8 we called
the Dr and made appt for 10:30. Too much pain. Went to office and sat in
waiting room until room available. Dr. K examined him, took an EKG, which
looked rather inconclusive, wanted Bill to go to ER or at least see a
cardiologist. Bill thought a gastro Dr would be better but wanted to wait
until this passed. Dr. K prescribed Atonal as an addition high blood
pressure medicine and suggested some antacidsPrevicid OTC and Mylanta. Went
home. Bill felt better, rested all day. Ate lightly. ( At La Clinica, Bill
thought he might vomit and went to bathroom. During that time Dr. K told me
he feared a blood clot had left the heart and lodged where the pain was.
Told me to take him to ER if the pain continued and to have the ER DR call
him.)

WednesdayBill slept and ate lightly all day. I got home about 3:30 and
found him red in the face, wearing sweats. He had a temp of 101. Gave him 2
Tylenol. Made him 2 scrambled eggs and poured him a 7 Up. Felt okay. He
spoke with Ely on the phone in the evening, and watched TV. Hot tubbed and
bed by 9:30.







ThursdayBill woke at 1AM in terrible pain in his gut in the area of the
appendix. He didnt even wish it on Bush! No position felt comfortable. Took
him to ER at 4:30. Admitted. Informed ER DR about Dr. K and had him call.
(Dr. K later told me that the ER DR had called and that he warned him about
Bills heart and the possibility of clots.) ER DR thought Kidney stones
causing pain, surgeon, Dr Collins, thought appendix as white blood cell
count high, pain in right spot, and fever. No one, even anesthesiologist
said anything about Dr Ks report and no EKG taken as far as I can remember.
Bill spent day in ER room (no rooms available in either hospital)on a slow
drip (50-75) of saline solution, morphine for pain. He was very dehydrated.
Surgery at 7PM. At 8:10PM Dr. Collins came out and said appendix fine,
(removed as long as he was open), could see no obstruction in bowel. Thought
just opening him up would relieve pain! Bill resting well and I went home.

FridayCalled hosp early and was told Bill had good night. Arrived about
8:15 and met Dr K in Lobby. We went up together and into Bills room. Bill
could not see nor could he remember. Dr Collins came in, checked Bills eyes
(okay) and ordered a neurologist. Dr Jain arrived at about 7PM. No one had
told him it was urgent! He hadnt left the hospital until about 10:30 doing
rounds. Nurse (Barbara) had done the calling, even called him twice. He
examined Bill and decided it was a stroke. It was then determined that Bill
had the stroke between 7 and 8:30 AM, as Nurse Delia had gotten him up for
the bathroom a he gone back to bed by himself. Jain called for a
cardiologist. Dr Guido Leon was on call and he didnt want to take the case
as he wasnt going to be available over the weekend. Dr. Cannon came in the
next day. Bill had a rough night, hallucinating about losing his glasses and
giving everyone a hard time. Didnt know where Melvan was. Didnt know he
was home in LC. Had to repeat his trip home and the days after many times as
no memory of hardly any of it.

	SaturdayIm a bit blurry. Spent the day with Bill. Dr Cannon had tests
done. Bill had atrophic fibulations as well as the PVCs. This is what
caused the stroke. Bill confused, and masking his fear. Dr Jain had an MRI
done which showed old strokes as well as this onelike a rain showers. Bad
long day. Had to reassure him a lot. A lot of companytoo much stimulation.
Still had to repeat trip home and days following.




SundayMore confusion and hallucinations during the night. Something about
losing me in a railroad museum. Still concern as to where Melvan was. Less
company, quieter in room. More reassured. Saw Dr Cannon. Starting to see
shapes. Very tense from hunger. Told nurse they were killing him by not
feeding him. She called Collins who put him on soft diet and he gobbled his
2nd lunch up (1st liquid).

MondayQuieter. Bill said he realized he had a stroke and cried. Still
confused. Still had me lost in railroad museum. All days apologized for
doing this to me and thanked me for standing by him. Saw no DRs. Could see
shapes and movement. No colors. Not as hungry! Food awful! Walked down the
hall 2xs

TuesdayCame in late. Bill had another bad night trying to find the
bathroom. Gave him a talking watch so he could hear the time of day.
Confusing about time. Sight about the same but could see more things or
movement close up. Put toothpaste on brush. Afraid of memory. Still
disoriented. Jane Grider and I did Reiki on him. Walked the hall 2xs. I
left at 4:30. Dr Richard Solomon, a friend coming to visit, called about
8:30 to say Bill was sleeping.

WednesdayBill had a good day, more vision coming back tho slowly and in
black &amp; white. He had a esaphogist echo which show his heart had no holes
between ventricles. A good thing. He will be on comadin for the rest of his
life. Dr Cannon has released him. Dr Collins said he will release him and
take staples out tomorrow. Dr Jain wants him to see an ophthalmologist for a
field vision next week. He has to sit in bright rooms, in front of a color
TV. Also meditate on a black dot. What a day. Jane came and did Reiki again.

ThursdayWent to hosp early as Bill wanted help in morning. Dr. Collins
never showed up. Staff never changed sheets or washed Bill up. I complained
and they did their job. Richard Solomon came in the evening. Went home at
6:30PM exhausted. Hope Collins showed up after I left so I can take Bill
home today.
