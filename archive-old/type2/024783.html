Rob,

The way you describe it, it's a no-brainer. If you have the cash on hand,
buy that beautiful westy. And I don't think $4500 is too much. Of course,
try to know more about that 100 mi engine (its source and who put it in) and
why the PO put all that effort into his/her bus to resell it at a loss. Are
there receipts for the work done?

Don't worry about the &quot;instant gratification&quot; part :) It would be silly to
pass up on such a good deal...

Just my opinion,

Sami
