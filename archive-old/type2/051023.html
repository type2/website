Dear Jo.

I also fitted some moulded plastic, late model year, twin-speed ventilation 
booster fans (I have a note of the VW Part Number somewhere) to my British 
specification 1973 VW 1600 Type 2 Westfalia Continental, a few years ago, 
after having advertised for them in VW Motoring Magazine. These fans do not 
seem to have been a standard fitting, on any of the British specification 
1968-79 VW Type 2s

A few years later, I came across a pair of metal, early model year, booster 
fans, like yours, at a local VW show, which I bought on spec, with the 
intention of selling them on to one of my VW Type 2 owning aquaintances, 
which I later did.

I have wired mine up, so that the fans only operate when the blue, 
ventilation lever(s) is/are in the open position, which avoids me having to 
remember to turn them off!

Regards.
             Nigel A. Skeet
