Subject: fuel tank level problem

My tank reader was fine if the tank was full but would suddenly drop to zero on reaching a certain level. Recently I have had cause to pull the engine, so while I was at it I inspected the tank and the sender unit. On dismantling the sender unit I noticed that one of the fine wires is broken probably giving the above results.

Instead of visiting the car breakers (I hate to imagine how much VAG want for one!) is there a way to repair this, has anyone done it before? Perhaps some fine soldering... or is it not worth the trouble!?
