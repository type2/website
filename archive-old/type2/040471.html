[Hi Sean] I have replaced quite a few bus panels in the past,and I can tell
you firstly it will be alot cheaper to do the work yourself, rather than a
body shop do it.  Its rearly not that difficult to learn to weld, it just
needs a bit of confidence for you to bite the bullet, and go for it! you can
pick up a decent mig welder for about £100, (the cost of this will be
recouperated with the money you save by doing the work yourself).practice on
some scrap metal first, and you will be welding resonably before you know
it. A good manual that I found very useful when I first started, was the
haines 'beetle and transporter restoration manual' That will cover all you
need to know to get you started, you can pick it up in any good book shops,
i.e.W.H.smiths. It also gives you a great buzz knowing you have done the
work yourself,
                         good luck  Kampaman.

&gt; I want to replace a couple of body panels on my 78 westy this summer.  I
&gt; have no clue what this involves.  Is it generally cheaper to get whole
&gt; panels removed and welded back on by a body shop than it is do to other
&gt; body work?  It is something that is really not to difficult that I might
&gt; be able to attempt my self and if so does anyone know of any good
&gt; resources where I can find detailed info about body work?
&gt; Thanks all
