To hold the fan get a large screwdriver in against the fan blades.
To get the right orientation try it with the alternator installed.  
Place the blade straight down between blades.  That's how the 
screwdriver fits to remove fan bolt.
BTW this is how I rotate the engine when needed.

Another trick for removal/installation.  Loosen and remove the belt 
adjustment bolt.  Remove the long bolt securing the alternator to the
bracket hanging on the fan housing.  Get an extension and remove the 
bracket BEFORE attempting to remove the alternator.  It's possible to 
remove alt without removing bracket, but it's a real pain trying to 
install alt.  Simple enough to remove the bracket.

&gt; I'm going to replace the 81's alternator tonight (got to have something to do
&gt; waiting for the Braves to resume play) which seems to be simple enough. I'm
&gt; wondering, however, if there is a trick to securing the fan in order to get
&gt; the nut off with a socket when transfering it from the old to the new
&gt; alternator ?
