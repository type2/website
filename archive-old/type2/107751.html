Subject: [T2] An EGR question that has me stumped


&gt; I am an owner of an '80 FI Vanagon. I recently removed my rotten EGR
filter,
&gt; and made only two changes.
&gt;   1.. Replaced the EGR filter with a block-off-plate on the underside of
the
&gt; tin.
&gt;   2.. Removed the linkage rod between the EGR valve and throttle.
&gt; Afterwards, I did the timing light and idle adjustments. Since then,
whenever
&gt; I change gears and try to accelerate or coasting/ then accelerate, the van
&gt; studders and goes into a 5 second convulsion before it figures its' self
out
&gt; and then everything is fine.
&gt;
&gt; My question is.... Do I need a CO adjustment?........Or do I need to put a
&gt; block-off-plate where the EGR valve is?........Or is it something
completely
&gt; else?    It just seems that the convulsions to my engine started after
taking
&gt; off my holey EGR filter. Can anyone help with this studdering problem?

Hard to say.  The CO is set at idle.  At idle the EGR valve is closed.  So
why would removing the EGR filter, and blocking it off, affect this?

Of course, if the EGR filter was leaking, you'd be introducing unmetered air
into the system at partial throttle and if the CO had been set with this
false air in the system then blocking off the pipe to the EGR valve would
affect things.

Question:  You did block off the hole in your exhaust system - the one at
the crossover pipe that the EGR filter attached to - right?

I guess I'd feel more secure if the block-off plate sat under the EGR valve
itself.

Seems like it's time for a comprehensive tune-up, with a CO adjustment
coming after everything else is set.
