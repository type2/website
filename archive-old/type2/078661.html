Subject: RUST - front seat belt mounts

Anyone else found rust when they pulled up the pedestal mats for the seat 
belt mounts closest to the door in the late model Bays?

Mine has two little rusty pimples about the diameter of a quarter.

Going to grind them down and spot weld a new piece of metal in I think.

Any other solutions out there?
Ciao!
