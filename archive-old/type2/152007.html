&gt; &gt; can't exactly leave it in the parking lot...maybe just get a tow home,
&gt; &gt; rent a U-haul and trailer....?!?!
&gt;
&gt; That isn't really an option in my books anymore... I thought it was till last
&gt; year.
&gt; I priced the $29.99 per day truck to take me &lt;one way&gt; home from Halifax to
&gt; Toronto... it is 1200miles
&gt;
&gt; $2200 cdn dollars,, at todays rate is ~$1800 u.s.a dollars.. plus fuel,
&gt; insurance, taxes, etc etc etc
&gt; Unless U-haul is a lot cheaper in the USA..........
&gt; I can do a lot of fixin on the spot for that !!  I don't have to do my repairs
&gt; in my own driveway.

WHOA!!!!  I did the rent a truck and trailer thing for my bus couple years
ago and from Richmond VA to Baltimore MD about 200miles it was approx $100
or so...
