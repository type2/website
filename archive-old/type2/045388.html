Subject: [T2] help needed in Austin

Hello all,

I am a fairly recent addition to the list and posted a bit on my DPD a/c
system in the past. I got some wonderful replies and a couple of offers to
help do some work on my bus. The bad news is that since then I have been
through two bum computers and have lost all past emails:(

My question: is there anyone in the Austin area with an inside and outside
micrometer set that could help me after I split the case halves apart this
weekend? I am doing this engine rebuild in baby steps and on a limited
budget, and although I know a set of mics would greatly enhance my tool box,
I really don't have that kind of money right now. Any help would be much
appreciated, even if you don't have any mics; maybe just some good insight.

Thanks for all the wonderful posts,
Jesus
