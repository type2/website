Maybe you lost your ground strap?

Try using a set of jumper cables (one side) and create a circuit from the 
engine to the frame...)

Then try to start the engine.

I have seen symptoms of this on Chevys and Fords.

&gt;The short version:
&gt;Bus (1970 Westy) ran fine until I got to South Georgia, where it simply
&gt;quit. The symptoms:
&gt;
&gt;1) VDO oil pressure (not temperature, pressure) gauge suddenly goes off the
&gt;end of the scale. It had been running at 45 pounds highway (60-65 mph) for
&gt;more than a thousand miles, steady and sure. Then suddenly it shoots up to
&gt;over 80 pounds, then the needle keeps on going and pegs. My mind is set to
&gt;register panic over low oil pressure, not high. &quot;Weird,&quot; says I, cruising
&gt;along and enoying the southern Georgia scenery. &quot;Must be a problem with the
&gt;gauge.&quot; So I shove in the clutch to see if varying the engine RPM will make
&gt;any difference. I manage to let it idle once, rev it up again, when the
&gt;engine backfires and dies. Will not restart for love nor money. Backfires
&gt;through the carb. Spins fine.
&gt;
&gt;2) I also run a VDO oil temperature gauge which is mounted in the oil sump
&gt;and always reads low (120-180). I got into the habit of just adding 70
&gt;degrees. The oil temp gauge did not show any abnormal readings before the
&gt;disaster.
&gt;
&gt;3) No red light before the engine stopped. Engine is not hot when I inspect
&gt;it. Oil level is okay.
&gt;
&gt;Question: What the hell could cause such a sudden rise in oil pressure? Am I
&gt;looking at two different problems that just happened to occur at the same
&gt;time, i.e. something goes wrong with the engine and the oil pressure sender
&gt;crapped out? I don't get it.
&gt;
&gt;Anyway, rescued by Charlie Ford, entrepreneur and one of the idea men behind
&gt;the AIRS list. Got a shirt to prove it. Full trip report to come.
