Subject: Planning My First Engine Pull

Greetings!

As spring approaches here in Minnesota, I'm planning to pull the engine in
my '79 Deluxe Westy to install a new clutch.  I've pulled engines from bugs,
but this is my first bus. On my bugs I had to get the rear of the car pretty
high in the air to clear the rear apron.  Bently doesn't mention needed to
raise the rear of my bus.  I've searched the archives and have found
conflicting info, not to mention about 30 different methods of removal.  I'm
going with the &quot;unbolt engine/slide straight back/lower using floor jack&quot;
method that I'm used to from my past bugs.  Not looking to start an engine
pulling thread, but do I need to get the rear end of the bus in the air, and
if so, how far?

One more question, on an unrelated note:  It seems to take along time for my
engine to return to idle speed.  I searched the archives and most of the
posts pointed to the AFM, but I recently installed a rebuilt unit from Bus
Depot.  All of my vacuum lines are in good shape (replaced most of them).
Engine is 2.0 liter, FI, stock everything, running perfect except for this
small annoyance.   Any ideas?

Thanks in advance, you're a great bunch of people.  I'm also a Volvo freak
and the people on the Swedish Bricks list aren't nearly as friendly and
helpful as all of you.  A new person to that list was told that he should
learn how to use Spell Check before he even attempted to fix his car!  No
one on this list would ever say that :)
