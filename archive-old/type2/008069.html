&gt;  I need help with your summary.  How can it be that a cam which has 0.010
&gt; removed from it ends up having &quot;factory specs&quot;?  What specs? Was not the
&gt; original cam designed to lift a rocker arm by a definite amount?  It
&gt; doesn't seem as though a reground one can possibly do this.


Think of the cam from just the point of view of the cam follower.  

The small diameter of the lobe is the &quot;base circle&quot;.  The cam follower rides at this height
thru most of the cam rotation, then is lifted to its maximum height at the tip of the lobe.
This difference in height is the lift at the cam.  When you regrind the cam to &quot;factory spec&quot;
you make this lift difference the same as the original, even though you have changed the actual
dimension.
The cam follower now rides closer to the centerline of the cam thru most of the rotation, then
is lifted by the same difference as the original, but to a height that is ultimately closer to
the cam centerline.
I'll reiterate with an actual type IV cam and dial calipers (in inches): 
Measuring across the small dimension on a lobe I get 1.220.
Measuring across the large dimension on the same lobe I get 1.456.
1.456 minus 1.220 equals 0.236.
This is the lift at the cam.  Ratio rockers make this a bigger lift at the valve.
If 0.010 is needed to be removed to clean up the lobe tip, then the base circle would need to
be brought down to 1.200 (the 0.010 is from a radius, so twice this amount is taken from the
diameter)
1.436 (the new height) minus 1.200 (the new base circle) equals 0.236, so the lift is the same,
hence &quot;factory spec&quot;.
Would the factory really like this?  No, because it makes for higher wear on the lobe and
follower, but it does work.
Can you tell by measuring if a cam needs replaced? 
We don't have enough information for that, so we have to go by appearance.
I hope this helps
Don
(don't even ask about that cam I measured, none of the lobes seemed to match)
