Subject: [T2] starter soleniod for AT

 Last month I finally got my 77 Westie (automatic)
back after loads of expensive transmission work.  
That turned out great; I even have 3 more MPG now!
     But now it seems my starter solenoid is dead.  I
did the customary tests: I can make the starter whirr
alone and can make the engine turn over if I connect
the respective leads.  But the only replacement
solenoids I can find are for manual transmissions! 
Does anyone know where I can get one for auto?  
   This is pretty straightforward, if only 
I can get the part!
        Thanks,
          Kailo
