Subject: .speaking of Clunks...how do you stiffen Koni's?

&gt; 
&gt; &quot;What's that noise?&quot;
After getting new ball joints and adjustable Koni shocks installed by a 
mechanic, we noticed a &quot;clunk&quot; from under passenger side front seat area 
when hitting bad dips or potholes.
Inspection underneath led us to first believe it was a missing rubber 
torsion arm limiting bumper, but no, it was the bolt for the extra 
seatbelt I put in 20 years ago so daughter could ride facing backwards 
in her baby seat. It would hit the tire on a bad dip!  Bolt is now cut 
off, and I suspect the Koni's have to be &quot;stiffened&quot; -can someone point 
out how to do this?


Duroshark quoth:
&gt; Just last Friday I started getting an odd clunk sound when I hit a
&gt; bump and occasionally when hitting the brakes.
