Subject: A few free things

The station wagon I have been using as a storage shed is going today. I 
have to get rid of:

A rubber mat for the cargo area, fair condition with a couple bolt holes 
put there by PO.

Big interior panel from cargo area, good condition, brown vinyl.

A side and wing window.

It's not much, but it's what I have got. It's free to whomever can come 
and pick it up *today*.

San Diego (La Jolla). P-mail me.
