&gt;I am thinking of buying a pair of  used , air cooled heads for my vanagon
&gt;2.0L, and would like to know if anyone has a good idea of how much one of
&gt;them weighs, so I can guesstimate the shipping costs?

17.5 lbs.

I prefer Fedex ground for shipping heads. They seem to offer the best rates.
