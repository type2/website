Ron,

     I too have had excellent help &amp; service from Halsey.  We have lost a
few places in recent years.  Parts Barn was a good place.  Oh well.  Have a
great Thanksgiving.

&gt; A few weeks back, I asked for advice on this and received a number of
&gt; helpful replies. Unfortunately, the unit was not constructed to be
&gt; disassembled - so no cleaning/lubing was really possible. I tried
&gt; several parts outlets, but the motor was not available - until I called
&gt; a local parts supplier.
&gt;
&gt; Halsey Import Parts (Portland, OR) had 2 in stock! Great!
&gt;
&gt; For those interested, Halsey has never failed to have parts I needed in
&gt; stock - ok, so they're on the top of the call list next time out. Very
&gt; knowledgeable and helpful staff.
&gt;
&gt; (503) 256-0182 or 1-800-792-0081. They will ship UPS.
&gt;
&gt; (BTW, I have no financial ties to ths company.)
