Subject: Heater blower motor

A few weeks back, I asked for advice on this and received a number of
helpful replies. Unfortunately, the unit was not constructed to be
disassembled - so no cleaning/lubing was really possible. I tried
several parts outlets, but the motor was not available - until I called
a local parts supplier.

Halsey Import Parts (Portland, OR) had 2 in stock! Great!

For those interested, Halsey has never failed to have parts I needed in
stock - ok, so they're on the top of the call list next time out. Very
knowledgeable and helpful staff.

(503) 256-0182 or 1-800-792-0081. They will ship UPS.

(BTW, I have no financial ties to ths company.)
