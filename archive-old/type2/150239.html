Subject: Re: [T2] Re: Wind Shield - Window Removal

Hi Larry,

It's a lot easier to access the windshield from the outside. Cutting  
as previously described will release the windshield, and it can then  
be pressed gently into the hands of the helper on the outside.

I have managed to pull a couple of windshields single-handedly  
without breaking them, but it's much easier to do with a helper than  
without one.
