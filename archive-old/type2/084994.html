Subject: Re: [T2] Insurance info for 78 Bus

Nah - State Farm sold me full (comprehensive) insurance on my '78 Westy.

Pretty cheap too.

Be sure that you set an agreed upon value - if the bus is totalled you get 
$5K (or more) b/c the book value on our busses is nothing these days. You 
may have to show alot of receipts and pics of the bus to make your point.

I'd hate to see you insure your bus and only get $750 when your bus was hit 
and totaled by a meteor one night.

&gt;I know someone has the answer to this, or at least a tip on where I
&gt;should start!  My 1978 Baywindow was recently the proud recipient of a
&gt;much save-for pain job and looks fabulous.  Up till this point I had
&gt;only carried the minimum amount of insurance on it for liability; now
&gt;because it is looking good I would like to get additional insurance on
&gt;it just in case some ding-dong drives into me (or I into him!)  But is
&gt;it too old for the insurance company to do this?  I know of classic or
&gt;antique coverage but this bus is my daily transportation and I think
&gt;that has a milage limit on it.  Any advice?
