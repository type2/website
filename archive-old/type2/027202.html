Martin,
  Sounds like the old &quot;voltage drop&quot; problem. I installed
a 12 volt relay back by the starter and operate it with the key. The relay
provides a short path from the battery to the starter. seems that long wire run
&gt;from the back to the front and all the way to the back again can cause problems.
I put this relay in 7 years ago and havent had the problem since. I got my
relay at my local Vdubb place.... they called it a &quot;hard start relay&quot;... I have heard of
people useing a ford starter relay too.
   let me know if you need info on how to wire it in... I can try and explain it after
I look at my schematic again.

Any suggestions would be appreciated.

Suddenly my single cab will start only occasionally.  The battery is good.
If I bypass the ignition switch and solenoid (terminal 30 to 50?) by the
screwdriver method the the starter whirrs happily. If I bypass the ignition
alone with screwdriver method the motor starts up instantly. Does that mean
I need a new ignition switch? Usually it will start several times with the
key after performing either of thise two maneuvers.
