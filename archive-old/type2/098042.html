Greg,

The reason for limiting the search to '73 Westy bodies is that that is
what I have.  The '73 has a number of one-year features and while the
interior would go into any number of bodies ('68-73) it would be wrong for
any other year and some parts will not fit any other year.  I like the
other years, don't get me wrong, but starting from where I am and wanting
to do an &quot;instant resto&quot;, I would prefer to wind up with the correct
interior in the correct body.

The differences in the '73 from earlier buses:
Uses a one-year non poptop shell and one year cot up top;
has mustard cloth upholstery, not mustard vinyl.

The difference from later years is more major...
the poptop is the same as the '68-72 and hinges at the
front.  In later years, the poptop hinges at the rear.
The roof hole is the same size as the sunroof hole, not the extended hole
in the '74-79 Westies.

VW buses... they're all the same, except that every year is different :-)
