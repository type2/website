Subject: [T2] I'm back/SEMA success

After walking my hiney off yesterday, I find the SEMA show a success. I will
be bringing in a complete line of GERMAN brake fluids, lubricants and
sealants, also will be expanding my line of brake parts to include the
complete line of aTe and FTE brake parts, Pagid ( German new) brake shoes
and pads, covering all years up to and including Vanagons. Also will be
bringing in a complete line of OEM Mexican VW parts including NEW doghouse
fan shrouds and complementing tin and Turn key New Mexican factory engines,
these come complete even down to the P/P, clutch and heater boxes. My
on-line catalog will start to be updated as new items arrive. This is an
exciting move for us as we are always trying to please the air cooled bus
owner/driver by supplying quality parts for the air cooled VW bus.

ps. I also found some seal which might solve the Safari leakage problem,
stay tuned as I'm going to try these on my DD as soon as I install my
Safari's.  Still looking for weld in tabs and wing nut's.
