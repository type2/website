Subject: Re: [T2] Torque

&gt;   Iwas just thinking about the subject of torgue on the way home the
&gt; other day pulling a long steep hill in my 72 westy. In consideration of
&gt; torque (which is  a factor in the computation of horsepower) it is
&gt; absolutely critical to consider at what point in the rpm range the
&gt; torque is generated. In fact the torque vs RPM curve overall is the most
&gt; critical factor to consider when considering how the motor will power a
&gt; given vehicle with a given drive train.

From my brief observations of VW engines I've noticed:

- they produce maximum torque around 3,000rpm but don't sustain it for very
long
- they don't rev very high
- they have ignition systems that generate weak spark at high rpm

It seems that the maximum torque is at the point where the engine is
breathing the best. It's drawing the maximum amount of air into each
cylinder.

Increasing bore will increase the HP. The 1700, 1800 and 2000cc engines all
have the same basic HP, have 94mm pistons and bear this out.
