&gt;It is a heavy, rubbery material with a self-adhesive backing that, while
&gt;not quite as effective as Q-pads, certainly comes close. 

Close is good, but are you sure that it isn't just as effective? Once 
more, I strongly suspect that the expense in Q-pads is related to labor 
saved rather than effectiveness of materials.
