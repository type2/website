Subject: bus sandblasted, priming now, acrylic hardener or not?

The daughter's 75 bus roof had been repainted in the past, and I
understand it had been by the shore....the roof showed some rust bubbles
that upon trying to strip/sand led me to decide to pay for sandblasting
it.  Well worth it; much rust going on under there which was unseen?  I
asked to include the whole nose (many stone nicks, under/in the gutters,
and just the bottom rocker strips.  I masked it and it was $85/hr and
2.5 hrs,,,, they used a real fine sand; nose looks fine, roof has
noticable pits.  A pinhole on a rocker tells me it's likely rusting from
the inside.
    It's about 70 deg here now, and I will likely move to the garage to
do the final coat......any experience out there on using the hardener,
which I understand gives a fast cure, but initially takes 4 hrs to dry
and is very toxic?  The same Centauri acrylic enamel paint I used years
ago without hardener looks fine now on the 78, but that was in the rear-
does the hardener merely hasten curing, or will it give a more durable
coat agasinst abrasion?.  I was given a prep solvent and a grey &quot;sealer&quot;
to allow an even final coat blending old painted areas to fresh
metal/primed areas.  The final coat is white over old red.
