	Matthew,
	I'm not sure the typical storage place will let you pull an engine-
We have a place that's big enough (10' X 15') but it wouldn't be my 
first choice of where to do it. In Silicon Valley's that $136/month.

	Some garages rent space, so you could do a pull-and-swap
Ok but for pull and work-on-it you need to both work on the vehicle
and store it sans-engine-and-tranny. Maybe the storage place is
the best bet. Buy some 10mil (0.01&quot;) polyethylene sheet, big enough
to complete cover the floor, and make like Barney on Mission: Impossible.
Leave no trace.

	Gorilla Rack (?) steel shelves, about $75 retail for 36&quot; X 18&quot; X 72&quot;,
can be assembled into a work-bench in about 10 minutes with just a 
rubber mallet and would probably support the work. Wrap the particle
board shelves in more polyethylene or paint with oil-based primer
and paint the weekend before. A 2' X 4' sheet of 1 3/32&quot; subfloor plywood
would DEFINATELY be strong enough for the top. 

	Making friends with someone local who has work space would
be cheaper, where do you live?

	Bill
