Subject: Installing oil pressure sender

Whoops. Sorry about posting this twice.

The Gordon P. Haynes memorial method of sender
installation, as detailed to me by Brian K. Lanahan,
has you screwing the sender straight into the old spot
where the oil pressure idiot light sender used to
hide. If you're lucky, you can sneak the new sender
down enough in the hole already there so it's just
about flush with the case, and you'll be halfway
there. Failing that, you'll need to tap down a little
bit with the proper thread. Maybe coat the threads of
the sender with gasgacinch so's you don't leak. Cut a
little hole in the tin to accommodate, and you're
done!

However, it's mighty close to the dizzy. You may have
to mess with it a little just so you can set the
timing. If memory serves, the sender is oblong, so
rotated one way it's clean and the other way it will
probably bump into the dizzy. I run a 009; I wouldn't
be surprised if even with the sender in the right spot
you'd bump into the vacuum biscuit of a non-mechanical
dizzy while fiddling with timing.

Cheers,
Ian
