A simple fresh oil change, and scribing full/qt down marks on the dipstick
sender solves that one.  Wires in the engine compartment are a bit more
shielded than the underside of the motor, no?

I was referring to a type 1 engine and the readings are different between
the dipstick/sump senders.  Does the 914 sender stick up an inch or so into
the sump?

The VDO sump plate sender used in the Porsche 914 measures the temperature
from exactly the same spot as a dipstick sender.  I've provided proof of
this in the past and yet some people still seem to think that this sump
sender is somehow inferior to a dipstick sender.  If you really want the
hassle of wires hanging in your engine compartment and having to carry a
separate dipstick with you and insert it every time you want to check the
oil, be my guest - but don't do it because you think you are getting a
better reading in &quot;hotter oil&quot; because it's simply not true.
