Subject: Off-subject but VW Related - Insurance for &quot;Dune Buggy&quot;

I have a Meyers Manx style &quot;dune buggy&quot; on a 1961 VW Beetle chassis.  I
am about to pull my hair out trying to find insurance.

State Farm wants almost $250 for 6 months
Hagerty &quot;doesn't insure dune buggies&quot;
Progressive wants over $370 for 6 months
GEICO want insure it because my wife and I only have one daily driver
that is less than 20 years old
Taylor want even look at an application until you give them a signed
check

Some insurance companies say, &quot;We can't insure it because it can be
driven off-road&quot;
Other companies say, &quot;We can't insure it because it can be drive on the
highway&quot;

There is no speaking or logic with these outfits just &quot;that is the way
it is&quot;.  I have tried to explain that a &quot;dune buggy&quot; (their words not
mine) is no more dangerous or different than a T-bucket or most any
other kit car.  (BTW, my definition of a dune buggy is a tubular frame
vehicle used, almost exclusively, off road.

There has got to be a way.

Suggestions...

Thanks,

Michael Martin

PS - My wife drives a 2007 VW New Beetle and my daily driver is a 1972
VW Beetle.  We also have two 1976 VW Transporters and one 1971 VW
