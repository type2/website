Hey hey again,

   Well I finally got the electrical part of the igntion out of my 71 type2 
campmobile and when I try and turn it over I get nothing. Are there any 
fuses that relate to this I should check. The guy I bought it from tried to 
hotwire it with no avail. He didn't cut any wires but he scrapped a couple 
of the cables which I have fixed up with electrical tape. If anyone Has any 
Ideas let me know. Im working on her now so help would be greatly 
appreciated. I just need to get her started so I can get the bus in the 
garage.

Many thanks again,

Joe

71 Campmobile
