Subject: H4 Headlight Upgrade $35/PAIR

Since there has been so much talk of improving headlights, I wanted to
advise those who have a '68-85 bus or vanagon (round headlights) that there
is a cheap and easy upgrade that involves little cost and no modification.
I once again have the H4 headlight kits for $34.95/pair.  These are
basically knockoffs of the H4 headlight kits sold by Hella and Cibie, but at
a much lower price.  They are drop-in replacements for the round headlights
currently in your bus, but rather than being sealed-beams, they use
replaceable (and included) H4 halogen bulbs.  They install in 5 minutes with
only a screwdriver, same as changing a bulb, and replacement H4 bulbs are
available at any auto parts store.

I should note that these are not technically street-legal in all states (nor
are the equivalent Hellas and Cibies), and technically are sold for
&quot;off-road use.&quot;  However, &quot;off the record,&quot; I had them on my own '85 Westy
for years and never had a problem.  Frankly they look outwardly the same as
the stock headlights so I doubt anyone would even notice they were
different.  I have not yet had a customer tell me they got flagged for them
on state inspection or anything like that (although even if you were, it
would be a 5-minute job to pop the sealed-beams back in).  And yes, I did
find the lighting improvement to be definately noticable, perhaps not huge
but significant enough to be well worth the minimal cost.

I had these a while back, but then was out of them for a while after the
supplier imported an entire container-load that had the mounting tabs in the
wrong locations!  Needless to say, I pulled them off the market until they
resolved the problem.  I ended up resolving it in a different way; my
current supply is from a different manufacturer entirely.

You can order these via the website (part number HQ6014), or of course call
or email me.  I currently have 12 pair in stock, first come first serve.
