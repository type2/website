Subject: weber progressive

hey,

ive got a 72 bus w/pancake engine, i believe its 1700.  anyway, its got a 
weber progressive carb on it.  im discouraged because i took it in to the 
doctor and after 400 dollars it runs worse than it has.  symptoms are: wont 
idle steady, stalls out all the time if there is any nip to the air and wont 
accelerate like it use to.  my question is &quot;is there anything i can do to 
this setup to get it drivable during the winter months&quot;.  if not, which is 
what ive heard elsewhere,  what carb set up is the best for it?  are the 
dual kadrons from low bugget a good investment?  will this get me on the 
road on real cold days?

any ideas would be great,
thanx,
patrick
