Dear list-
	I have a 1700cc I bought from Discount Auto Parts here in Albuquerque. 
It was a complete turn key including the webber carb.  My question is I
paid $400 for it.  Did I get a really good deal?  I had bickered with the
owner for a while until he came down to that price.  The engine was for a
buddy's 79 westy that caught fire.  Also does a 1700 have hydraulic
lifters?

thanks in advance
Chuck
