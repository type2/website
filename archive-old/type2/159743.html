&gt; That's a pic of mine cold. If you look at the door that slides into
&gt; place, you can see what looks like a mark from it being open more
&gt; fully. Can anybody confirm? It closes nicely when 12v is applied.


and if you want faster idle, just adjust loosen the nut and slide it one
way or another and it'll open more...
