Subject: Re: [T2] Wood interior for the Westy

&gt; i have a 74 westy and the interior is in great
 condition, except the wood paneling has lost its color
 in some spots...the wood itself is fine....

The 'wood grain' is washed away?

&gt; has anyone ever tried to sand the paneling and then
 try to stain it to match the original color(or any color)?

Not sure you can do anything to it. It is laminate. You would need to remove the laminate and get down to the
real wood. But then you have plywood....
Replacing the laminate is the only real fix....
