Subject: Rubber seat pedestal mats

&gt;Someone posted recently asking about installation of these but I lost the
&gt;message. On the inner wrap around mat, I used 3M Super Trim Adhesive spray
&gt;part# 08090 and it worked well. I installed the outer mat without any adhesive
&gt;and so far it doesn't seem to want to come out. On both pieces, there is a
&gt;portion on the top that folds over and slides into a recess in the pedestal. I
&gt;found that I had to trim these about 1/16&quot; or so with a utility knife to keep
&gt;them from bottoming out in the slot.

 I used spray contact cement.  This may not be the correct
glue.  It has a working time of less than two seconds.
It would be much easier to do this job using a glue with
a working time of about two minutes.
 When removing what was left of my original mats, I found
old brittle petrified glue holding both pieces on. I also
found lots of horsehaar and lost pocket change from the
1990s.  While digging out the old rubber from the slots,
there was no evidence of glue in those areas.
 The mats I used came from WCM, even though they had the
WW logo moulded into the rubber.  I had to make one tiny
'release cut' (thanks Ed &amp; Joe, the furniture guys) near
the front/top of the inner pieces.  I used a knife to cut
holes for the seat and seat belt mounts.  When I tightened
the seat belt bolts, the rubber twisted a bit.  So I
waited until the next day to tighten them down to allow
the glue to dry fully.  Finally, I tucked in the last bits
near the front footwell/step area and glued them down.



&gt;On the inner mat, it is easier if you *don't* apply adhesive to all 3 sides at
&gt;once as it is virtually impossible to get it all positioned properly this way
&gt;(ask me how I know!). What worked better was to wrap the entire mat around the
&gt;pedestal without adhesive and fold the above mentioned portion over into the
&gt;slot. When everything is positioned the way you want it, have someone on the
&gt;opposite side of the car hold their fingers firmly over this section to keep
&gt;the rubber from coming out of the slot. Then lift the mat up from the bottom
&gt;so that you can spray the adhesive and just glue the section toward the center
&gt;of the car at this time. When this is dry, then go back and glue the front and
&gt;rear sections.

 I did not have an assistant, so I tack glued the
rubber into the slots first.  Waited for that to dry
fully and then glued the rest in position.

 Since mine is a camper model, I had to remove the
Westy furniture to gain access to the back of the seat
pedestals.  I saw no need to use the mats/covering for
the concave parts on the lower aft portion of the
pedestal.  I trimmed the mats back with a knife,
closely matching the shape of the OEM pedestal mats.

 The cockpit has a more finished appearance.  I bought
a new front floor mat from ebay last year.  The mat
for the walkthrough aisle appears to be NLA.  Any leads?

Best of luck,
