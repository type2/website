&gt; Peter, if you are thinking about a PC instead of a laptop, look into the
&gt; mini-ITX platform, and smaller, at someplace like logisys_dot_com or

Hey Terry. Thanks! I found a whole bunch of &quot;Carputer&quot; information at 
http://www.via_dot_com.tw/en/VInternet/carpc.jsp all based on the mini-ITX boards. 
I was thinking of using a full-sized system stuffed under a seat somewhere, 
but since space in a bus is limited and heat is always an issue, the smaller 
sized and fanless mini-ITX systems look like they would be way better   :)


&gt; Another thing to put on your list would be vibration dampening for the
&gt; disk.  There are cheap sound dampening suspension systems that would
&gt; probably work.

Ah, yes. Of course.


&gt; I've run 3 foot extension cables (plus the normal cable) to a monitor
&gt; without problem, but don't know about LCD monitors....  It may be
&gt; expensive to get a color LCD screen that is visible in the bright light
&gt; of a dash - a monochrome one might work better...

Yeah, true...I've tried my laptop in a vehicle -- the screen is *just* bright 
enough, unless the sun is shining on it. I was thinking that if it was inset 
into the dash or had a hood around it, then it might work okay. Perhaps 
dimming the interior with window tinting film may help, too.
