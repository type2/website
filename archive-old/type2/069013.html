&gt;&gt;true.  The WR-1 kit is only ever mentioned in a footnote in the starter
&gt;&gt;section of the Bosch master catalog :-( Getting your standard issue
&gt;&gt;parts-dweeb to actually find the entry, not to mention acquire one is nigh
&gt;&gt;on to impossible.  Fortunately, y'all may take advantage of the multiple
&gt;&gt;phone calls I made to innumerable FLAPS and to Robert Bosch, USA and find
&gt;&gt;the damned thing almost immediately by calling the following Company:
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Olympic Auto Parts
&gt;&gt;5168 Eisenhower Avenue
&gt;&gt;Alexandria, VA  22304
&gt;&gt;Tel. - (703) 370-0850
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Once you have reached this august assemblage of parts salesmen, ask
&gt;&gt;specifically for David Parker, as the rest of the counter-persons are
&gt;&gt;clueless as a clam on this particular item.  He will sell you one of these
&gt;&gt;kits for the princely sum of ~$11.00 US plus shipping.  As of last week,
&gt;
I can vouch for this little doohickey. Installed one in summer and have not
had to bang away with a hammer, spark with a screwdriver or push the car
since! Thing whirs over like a top and starts right up. CAVEAT: there is an
awful lot of sphaghetti when you are done - BE SURE TO TIE IT UP/DOWN
TIGHT! My friend Klien and I were driving around, testing for pinging; he
drove the car much harder than I do, stopped harder, too. All those wires
got eyeballs-out gforced and shifted. Car died (carb problem there); no
start. Our newly relocated relay refused to work - grounded out somewhere?
We stuffed it back where it belonged, unplugged and replugged the wire to
the solenoid, and it worked again. Got home and lassoed it down real purty.

BTW, if you are having *ANY* starting problems, I'd check the battery
cables, clean and/or replace them, take a good look at your ignition switch
and maybe replace it, and then install this relay (which Lewis says is
&quot;mandatory for all busses more than 15 years old.&quot; That's you.) Of all the
traffic about nonstarts on this list, 90% have been solved by one or all of
these maintenance items. If you do them NOW you may never have to post a
&quot;Won't start&quot; to the List at all!
