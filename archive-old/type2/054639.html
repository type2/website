Subject: '75-'78 Exhaust question/Heads?

Could someone please explain to me why VW went with the single round port 
exhaust on the ' 75 to ' 78 model years? I've got a stock ' 78 Westy, 2.0L 
FI, and the exhaust system/heater boxes are absolutly perfect, but people 
have told me that I'm losing a lot of hp because of the single round port 
exhaust system. They said that I should go with ' 79 heads and heater boxes 
as they give you a lot more hp. Is this true? if so, how much more hp? My 
Bently says that the hp for the ' 78 and ' 79 are the same. So I'm kinda lost 
on how changing my heads and exhaust would give me that much more power, 
especially as the valves are the same diameter on both the  round port 
exhaust and square port exhaust heads. Could I use heads from a 1.8L 
carburated eng. with my FI? Those heads are dual port exhaust and have the 
41mm intake valves, as opposed to the 33mm for the 2.0L heads. Or did VW put 
the smaller valves in the FI 2.0L for a reason, like maybe emissions control, 
or to limit the hp out-put? Sorry, I'm very confused with all of this. Would 
one of you folks who is good at this stuff ( I know there are a lot of 
Mechanical Engineers on the List) please help me out here?
Thanks,
Parker
