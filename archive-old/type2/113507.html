&gt;Volks,

&gt;I'm getting ready to tap my type-1 engine case for the return line on
&gt;a full flow oil filter system.
&gt;
&gt;Is that it, or should I be tapping the case somewhere else?

I consider it totally unnecessary for a street engine, but if I was going 
to do it I would find out how Bergs advises. They are the masters when it 
comes to modifications of T-I engines that actually work well, maintaining 
good reliability and longevity. Go to their site and buy their procedural 
literature and parts and aim for success.
