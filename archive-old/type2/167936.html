Subject: Re: [T2] Transition from Gas to Diesel

&gt; I will be the first to admit that I have very little knowledge of the 
&gt; difference between a gas engine and a diesel. With that, can a standard FI bus 
&gt; engine be converted to diesel?

&gt; 
   Cadillac tried that in '79 (along with Oldsmobile) and it was a 
disaster... ;-(
