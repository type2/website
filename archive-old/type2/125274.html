Subject: Which distributor to use?

Folks,

I want to get ride off the points on my 2L dual carb engine.

I have two electronic ignition distributors to choose from:

- Bosch 0 237 023 007, VW 071 905 205. This came off a Europan CU engine
(dual carb Vanagon). This would be the ideal candidate in terms of specs,
but the fiber washer between the distributor body and the piece that engages
with the drive shaft is missing. How bad of an idea is it to use this
distributor without the washer (Anlaufscheibe)? This might result in some
metal on metal rubbing. With the tools I have available I cannot drive out
the pin in the drive piece and thus I cannot even get to where the washer
would need to go.

- Bosch 0 237 022 025, VW 025 905 205 D, This one came off a federal 83-84
1.9 water-leaker Vanagon. The specs are close to the A/C distributor specs,
but are they close enough? Oldvolkshome says: Advance/Retard Range: Vacuum:
12-16deg Adv _at_ 10.6 In. Hg, 9-11deg Ret _at_ 10.6 In. Hg; Centrifugal: 16-20deg
_at_ 2400 rpm, 21-25deg _at_ 3800 rpm
It seems to be rather close VW 205 905 205 F ('73 Bus; 1700 Auto):
Advance/Retard Range: Vacuum: 8-12deg Adv, 11-14deg Ret; Centrifugal: 14deg
_at_ 1700 rpm, 15-19deg _at_ 2400 rpm, 21-25deg _at_ 3400rpm
My engine is not a stock bus engine: 914 flat top pistons, larger valves,
mild cam, 40mm Solex carbs - more or less 2.0 914 spec. The water-leaker
distributor specs seem to be a little more aggressive, but they are also
measured at higher vaccum than the A/C specs. Would this be good idea with
my setup or am I risking to run too advanced?

Now, which distributor shall I use - the one with the broken washer or the
water-leaker one?

Marcus
