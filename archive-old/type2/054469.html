Possible Answer 1:  Adjust the choke flap on your carb to be closed when the
engine is cold..

Possible Answer 2:  My old upright engine used to do such when the timing
was too retarded - what kind of distributor do you have?  A 009 would need
to be revved up to get enough advance that it doesn't die when put under a
load (especially if the advance is already a little too retarded)...

Timing, mixture, all that stuff needs to be right on..

Good luck,

&gt; I have had my 71 westy on the road for two weeks after a 10 year
&gt; hibernation.
&gt;
&gt; Question 1: I have noticed that when cold, she will not idle at all.  When
I
&gt; am at a stop light she just falls right on her face.  However, when warm
&gt; (after being ran for about 10 minutes) it idles very healthily.
&gt;
&gt; Question 2:  If I do not REALLY race the engine before I let the clutch
out,
&gt; it will want to stall.  It also chugs and acts like it is missing when
under
&gt; load.  I usually compensate by downshifting but I think 50 mph in 3rd is a
&gt; little hard on the motor.
&gt;
&gt; Any suggestions welcome (within the boundaries of good taste : ))
