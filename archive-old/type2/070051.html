Subject: Re: Anyone want a domestic 'fridge? Question on points.

Dear Glen,

If you were anywhere near me (Santa Barbara, CA) I'd take the 'fridge off 
your hands. The 'fridge in my '78 doesn't work. I've thought about
removing it and making an icebox though (like my '79 had, may it RIP).
SO my question to you: Any tricks or tips about removing the mother and
doing the icebox conversion? Is it going to leak ammonia all over me or 
something obnoxious like that?

A broader question to Glen and  anyone else:

Anyone ever restored a Westy's dead 'fridge to function? I wonder if it's
a simple matter of recharging the coolant or something. When I plug it in,
lights come on and a faint hum is heard, the pipes in the cabinet behind the
'fridge get warm, but no cooling in the 'fridge occurs.

To GLen re. point gap:

As I understand it, the little fiber thing on the point's lever arm that
is lifted by the rotating distributor shaft's lobes wears down over time.
When it wears, the point gap becomes smaller. So a small gap is what you 
would expect to get over time. I think a small gap would mean a shorter 
duration spark, which would make for less complete combustion, producing
less power and poor gas mileage? Probably no lasting damage done in your case.

Drive safely,
Surfer Bob
