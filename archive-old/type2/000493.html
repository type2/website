&gt; Can you be specific as to what changed in the heads? I
&gt;have a parts
&gt;book revised up through model year 1973. There is no M number
&gt;for unleaded.
&gt;Is it valve seats? Valves, valve guides?

From what I know now I think it mainly applies to type 1 engines. The valve
seats must be harder. Over here it is 'common knowledge' that type 1 engines
(on buses) need new heads. As a matter of fact they are still being offered
here as either suitable for unleaded or not.

Having said that I believe that an 'old' engine that has always been running
leaded will go on unleaded for quite a while if you don't drive it too hard.
Octane is not an issue. VW required 89 (RON) and our current unleaded is 95.
Numbers in the US are lower but that is because you use another standard of
measuring octane (hence the confusion about required octane for VW's, see
archive). So it's a mainly matter of wear. Since type 1 engines will be
rebuilt quite frequently you may never get to the point where this wear will
cause you a problem. Or you simply will not know whether running unleaded
was the course of your catastrophic engine failure. I have had a broken
valve back in '77 on a '71 bus which had always been running leaded. It
happens ....

This used to be a important issue when converting cars to run on LPG which
has always been quite popular in Holland. Many engines required new heads to
enable them to run on LPG which also has no lead (and is environmentally
friendly but heavily taxed by the government. Go figure!). The heads I have
on my '77 1600 cc were sold to me as 'LPG heads'. I don't know the source of
these.
