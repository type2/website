Subject: Please pmail If you saw me at 1999 campouts-

My attempt to reach Karl Bloss via email doesn't work, so I will ask the
list what I was going to ask him, and if anyone knows how to reach him. 
For LEGAL reasons, I need to hear from any listees present at
campouts/shows from May 1999 through Oct, and if they have details as to
exact dates, and any pics or rememberances of who was with me.  I was
the Westy owner with the beige 78 Westy that has the green &quot;mailbox&quot; pod
on top, green bumpers and wheels, an awning, and green tent that
fastened to the awning.  It also had green custom curtains along with a
modified interior including a central bed.  I remember going to Westies
in the Woods, where I think I had my 13 yr old daughter and 2 classmates
(a blond with glasses and a brunette; Everybus, where I had my daughter
and one friend;  also the Harwinton, Ct show and possibly Transporters
by the Tunnel,
Woodstock, and in particular, Busses by the Trail arount Oct 10 1999?
I possibly also went to PunkinChunkin if it was held in 1999 and
possibly one on a Maryland shore somewhere...  This is rather important,
for it will impact my future freedom.
