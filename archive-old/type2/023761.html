Hi,
	Try here:
http://www.michelin-us_dot_com/us/eng/tire/catalog/agilis.htm

 ...though that doesn't seem to link to all of the 
information available. You can find more at:

http://www.michelin_dot_com/us/eng/news/agilis/1.htm

 FWIW, I'm using Agilis 81s in a 195/70R15C on the
15&quot; rims I fitted to my bus. If I were still using
the stock rims I would probably choose either
the 61 or the 81 depending on how much money I
had and the tradeoff between the strength and 
stability of a stronger tyre and the firmer
ride that it gives you.
 Realistically, the 61s should be more than
adequate for a VW bus and they have a M+S
rating, which might be reassuring if you drive
on unmetalled roads much.

Cheers,
	  W.
