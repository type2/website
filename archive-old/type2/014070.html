Subject: Re: [T2] Windage tray pro and con for Type 4 motor


&gt; Could anyone explain the pro's and con's of putting a wind tray in the type
&gt; 4 case?  I know there is a place for it and it was primarily used on the
&gt; Porsche 914 motor...............
&gt; 
&gt; Where can they be purchased used or new/
If you are planning on autocrossing or road racing your bus you need one.  Otherwise you don't.

What they do is stop the oil from moving about the case and getting whipped up by the rotating parts. Normally gravity will do this fine in a 
bus.
