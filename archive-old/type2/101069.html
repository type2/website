Subject: Re: [T2] Double Cab Wood Slats 

Kevin,

I would have painted the whole bottom with por-15 before I painted it and 
then you could forget about it...as long as you used stainless screws to 
hold the slats.


Best bet is to make sure that you let it sit in the sun and dry well after 
washing!


Cheers, dave

&gt; Howdy,

&gt; I thought I'd throw this out on both lists just in case somebody out there 
&gt; has an answer but only reads one of them
&gt; 
&gt; I'm just about to put wood slats in the rear of my Double Cab.
&gt; I will be riveting them on and will be putting clear silicone on the bottom 
&gt; of the slats around the rivets
&gt; to prevent water from dripping down the holes.
&gt; 
&gt; I've been to dropgates_dot_com and haven't seen an answer to my question and 
&gt; might post it there also.
&gt; But as these lists get read more often and I want to put them in the next 
&gt; couple of days I was hoping to get an answer from you guys.
&gt; 
&gt; My question is &quot;Should I put silicone along the entire bottom of the slats 
&gt; so that water can not get underneath them?&quot;
&gt; 
&gt; This truck will see very little rain but my concern is more when I wash it.
&gt; I was thinking that water would get underneath the slats and possibly just 
&gt; sit there to cause future rust.
&gt; 
&gt; I've already spent 8 hours scraping what little rust spots there were on the 
&gt; bed and coating them with POR15.
&gt; 
&gt; I'd just like to prevent any future rust from occurring.
&gt; 
&gt; So what do you think?
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks Much,
&gt; Kevin
