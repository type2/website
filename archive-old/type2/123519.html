Subject: Problems Installing Side Window

I'm having problems installing the drivers side window in a '71 westy. 

With the seal on the glass it seems as if it won't sit all the way down in 
the 'socket. As if the seal is about 1/4 inch too much. 

I can get the bottom half in the 'socket' and sitting in the 'groove' but 
the top part won't go in as it looks as if it's about 1/4 inch too tall. 

The glass came out of a '74 and looks like it will fit just perfect but the 
seal looks to be just a tad to wide. 

Any suggestions? Should the entire glass be able to sit in the socket 
without any problems before you sit it in the groove? 

Would I be able to trip some rubber off the top without danger of leaking as 
long as I didn't touch the outside? 

Any suggestions?! 

Thanks!
