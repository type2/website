Hi Laura,

If your engine does not start, I'd suspect the engine, not the trans.  The 
rattling noise could be a rod knocking, a broken valve spring, a loose 
rocker, or small pieces of valve bouncing around inside your combustion 
chamber.

Check the following:
Spark plugs - black, oily, fuel-soaked plugs are bad.
Compression - the higher the better, anything below 75-80 is too low.
Valves - pull valve covers, check for tight valves, check for loose/broken 
anything.
Turn engine over by hand - any noises? any places where a piston isn't 
compressing? any places where you can't turn the engine at all?

It sounds like your Yosemite trip had all the ingredients for killing a Bus 
engine.  Lots of heat and stress are bad.  Downshifting is good, but won't 
help if your engine is already too hot.  Start saving money, because if you 
don't need to replace your engine now, you probably will in the near future. 
  It's a bummer, but it's part of the Bus experience.

Good Luck!
