Subject: Re: [T2] Aircooled Vanagon: RPM's vs. Speed

&gt; In 4th Gear on a stock tranny, what are the RPMs for 55, 60, 65, 70 and
&gt; 75 MPH? I want to know how high I am revving the engine at highway speeds
&gt; and figure out the best speed to cruise at without frying the valves or
&gt; overstressing the engine. I think the vanagon stock engine works best at
&gt; around 3000 to 3500 RPM, but I may be wrong.

A while back I posted a formula to calculate speed based on RPM:

If you put in your tire height and use the gear ratio numbers from the
Vanagon Bentley you'll be able to figure out the RPMs.
