&gt;&gt; Bill,
&gt;&gt;    1.7 - 2.1 is a pretty tight spec. A range of .4 an
&gt;&gt; your coil is off by .9 which is over twice the 
&gt;&gt; &quot;acceptable&quot; operating range. Soooo I would get a new 
&gt;&gt; one... the fact the range is so tight would tell me 
&gt;&gt; that it is pretty picky and wouldnt tolerate much 
&gt;&gt; more than a .2 ohm  plus or minus the op. spec.
&gt;
&gt;Hi Dan and everyone:
&gt;
&gt;I agree about 'tight spec.'  If it had been &quot;1.5 - 2.0&quot; 
&gt;it would have indicated a lot bigger rounding error 
&gt;acceptable in the measurement, but 1.7 - 2.1 suggests 
&gt;that Chilton is sweating it to 1/10 ohm, not to 1/2 
&gt;ohm.  
&gt;
&gt;But here's the funny thing: 
&gt;
&gt;I finally took my ohm meter to the FLAPS this afternoon 
&gt;after I wrote you [boy, they must love seeing me coming 
&gt;at this point].  I asked them to bring out a couple of 
&gt;brand new Bosch coils.  I carefully checked, and both 
&gt;of them showed a little bit more than 3 ohms across 
&gt;terminals 1 and 15--that's a tiny sliver higher, even, 
&gt;than the coil I have in the bus now and even farther 
&gt;out of the range Chilton prescribes.  [I checked 
&gt;Bentley, Clymer, and Haynes, and none has resistance 
&gt;test numbers for the coil, though Haynes does have a 
&gt;voltage test.]  
&gt;
&gt;Well, since I already have two coils [the one in the 
&gt;bus and a spare] that test out at that level now,  I 
&gt;didn't see the point in buying another one that would 
&gt;do it too.  At least not for now.  Maybe Chilton's 
&gt;numbers are suspect, or maybe I'm wrong.


So far as I know, Chilton does not establish specifications for any
automotive manufacturer. The only way to verify the accuracy of info in
there is to check the factory manual. Also, your test leads can easily add
an ohm or so to the reading. Also, the quality of the VOM and it's
calibration are paramont when measuring tight ohm specs.

Bad data is the only thing worse than no data. One reason I have little
need for Chilton publications. Most coils get replaced not 'cause they fail
a proper test, but because the proper testing is not followed. The proper
tests are in the factory manual. 

If ohms specs are not given, it's because the given procedures are adequate
for diagnosis without them. Follow the Bentley ignition system diagnostics
step by step and don't ignore the first paragraphs that suggest the
checking of grounds, terminals, battery and such. Skip a single step in the
procedures at your own peril. There are no short cuts to accurate diagnosis.

It is simply amazing how many 40 year old coils I have seen function
nominal. They are one of the most bullet proof items on the whole danged
car, but becoming little less so with latter day high energy systems. 

And they are just like ECU's in this regard. They just don't go bad on
their own, they are killed by something else in the system going haywire.
