Subject: RE: [T2] no spark :(

I hope this doesn't sound like a stupid question, but have you checked
the power to the coil and the negative ground on both the coil and the
engine?

Is there a phenomenon where the spark becomes erratic as the distributor
wears?

 I was driving my 71 single cab home today and she cut off in traffic,
after
a few tries she started back up and ran fine for a few miles then
stalled
again, started right back up then stalled after 15 feet and won't start
again.  :(

Fortunately a guy driving a 72 bug stopped and he helped me check for
spark
as one of us turned the engine over.  There was none. So he gave me a
ride
to the parts store, (super nice guy that had moved here from England)  I
bought a new coil, condensor, rotor and points.  Put it all in and still
no
spark???

What else can I check?  All the wires seem to be hooked up correctly.
Nothing loose. It gets gas.

I am running a stock 1600 with a stock solex carb.

Thanks in advance for any ideas...

And thanks to AAA for the ride home...
