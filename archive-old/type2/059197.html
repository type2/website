Subject: Re: blue smoke after sitting

Hi everybody.

I've put under 250 miles on my new, rebuilt engine, and sometimes (very
infrequently), when I start it (after its been driven and has sat an hour or
so) blue smoke comes out of the exhaust.

I've followed all directions regarding breaking in a new engine and kept
constant watch over the oil level. This just started happening in the last 125 mi.
I want your opinions before I hear my mechanic's, as impartial background to
his explanation.

Thanks,

Nikki P.
