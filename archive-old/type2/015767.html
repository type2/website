&gt;Thinking about living out of a bus I was wondering if anyone has tried solar
&gt;collectors? I use a small one to top up the battery, but how about heat
&gt;pumps &amp; collectors for hot water?

I have a 2'x4' solar panel permanently mounted to the top of my highroof.
It puts out up to 4 amps in bright sunlight and 1 amp even when it's
overcast.  I also have a solar charge regulator to keep it from
overcharging the batteries.  I got the equipment from Solar Electric in San
Diego.

I don't have anything for hot water but I got a great idea from sombody a
few years ago at a campout - how about mounting a 4&quot; black PVC pipe
(assuming one could find such a thing) along the rain gutter?  It would
look like an awning but really be filled with water.  I calculated the
volume once and it was decent - several gallons if I remember.  It would
heat up nicely in the sun and always be ready - no setup needed.
