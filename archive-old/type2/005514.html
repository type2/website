&gt; So what's the deal?
&gt; I'am I worrying about nothing and these heads are just fine?
&gt; Has anyone else bought type4 heads or 79(square port exhaust)
&gt; heads from AVP that could share what they think about them.

Hey Alex,

I bought a Vanagon long block from AVP and it has worked flawlessly for me.
15,000 miles so far. AFAIK the same heads as a 79?

After I bought it I had the chance to visit their shop. The guy who owns the
place is named Leonard and he showed me exceptional courtesy during my
visit. More importantly I inspected his shop - he is essentially a one man
band, one guy doing prep; with his wife working the phones and laying out
the assemblies. Leonard then assembles each one himself. He was very
organized, and I was impressed with the operation.

He even took off with me during the day to go and visit his private stash
for a rare part I needed. He didn't have it, but he took the time off to
help me find it.

I think that he is one of the good guys. I trusted him with $1,200 and he
did not let me down.

Give him a call and ask him about the heads, I think that you will be
impressed with his answers. (Sometimes they are hard to raise on the phone,
it's disturbing, but it is California.)
