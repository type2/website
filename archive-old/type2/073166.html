&gt;Can someone give me directions to the chat room that was mentioned a while
&gt;back? Is it still active?

Using the type2_dot_com chat server:

	--Get an Internet Relay Chat (IRC) client for your platform.

		Wintel: Get mIRC, which is free, here:
		http://www.mirc_dot_com/

		Macintosh: Get Ircle, which is shareware, here:
		http://www.ircle.houseit_dot_com/

	--Tell the IRC client prog to connect to our chat server,
	  irc.type2_dot_com

	--Remember, we have an entire irc server, so once you're connected
	  you have to start a channel (room) or join an existing channel.
	  By convention you will find listees in #buslist of an evening.

	--Yes we know about ICQ. Every time the chat room comes up somebody
	  starts raving about ICQ. If you want to be the hundredth person to
	  try to get everybdoy to switch to ICQ, which we are not going to
	  do, be my guest, just please wait til Friday. =^ )
