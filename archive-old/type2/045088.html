your alternator will NOT work unless that wire is operational (unless
someone rigged something up in the past). Besides providing a light, it's
the wire that provides the field current so the alternator can even work!

Subject: [T2] Blue Wire to Alternator


&gt; Just got a new alternator. Auto parts people seemed confused as to whether
&gt; or not it needed to be 55 or 75 amps. I got a rebuilt 55 for my '78 2.0 L
&gt; Bus.  Looks the same as the one I took out.
&gt; My dash alternator light has never worked. I assumed it might have
something
&gt; to do with the blue wire that comes out of the right rear wire cluster
below
&gt; the regulator. The wire was cut and now just dangles. Is this the wire
that
&gt; controls the dash light?If so, where does it connect to?
&gt; Thanks,
