I like the stuff.  Been using it for several years now.

&gt;I have a fresh rebuild and the 500 mile oil change to do and wonder what
&gt;grade I should use. There was 5w-30, 10q-30, and 15w50. Should I use the
&gt;10w-30 for the cooler seasons coming?

That's what I do.  10W30 in the winter and 15W50 in the summer.  That 5W
based stuff is so thin it makes me cringe - I wouldn't feel comfortable
running it in my bus.
