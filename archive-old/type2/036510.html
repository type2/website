&gt;  I am a mechanical idiot, I think the book was written for me....anyway have
&gt;  a '73 that I successfully removed the old, rusty extractor type
&gt;  exhaust....but my nice new stainless steel stock type muffler doesn't want
&gt;  to co-operate....if I try to go straight on, it hangs up on the studs, if I
&gt;  put one side on fully, the other side is about an inch or so too low...I
&gt;  don't want to try to persuade it and break somthing...stupid questions, but
&gt;  any help is appreciated as I need the bus soon for the big move to our own
&gt;  house.

Hi Rodney (et al),

I've only fitted 1600 exhausts but I imagine the problems are similar with T4 
engines.

The first time I put the exhaust on the studs tightened up one side, then the 
other, and the connections to the heater boxes, but when I moved to the top 
side of the tin ware and found it impossible to insert the bolts for the carb 
preheater tube. 
So I had to slacken off the nuts previously tightened and remove the heater 
box clamps to get sufficient movement in the exhaust to enable me to start 
all of the nuts and connections before going back around to tighten every 
thing up.

The second time I did an exhaust box I compensated for the poor fit by 
fitting everything loosely to start with and the box went on much easier.

Of course if the fit is worse than can be compensated for by this method then 
you will (as someone else suggested) have to hit it with your big hammer.

Good luck
