&gt; I started this thread to get people to think about their health, prolonged exposure to noises over 85dB is bad for you, I didn't realize that it was that loud, I work for a speaker manufacturer and I blew the Director of Engineering away with these results.

&gt; We are not supposed to be exposed to this kind of noise, sanity is right, I think that the biggest thing I really notice is fatigue, I get tired driving my bus with all of the noise, not the way I want to reach a trailhead.

I completely agree... that's why I spent some money and a little more 
time to do what VW decided not to do.  It definitely makes your drive 
much more pleasant!
