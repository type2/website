Subject: Re: CHT sensor location

&gt;That's supposed to be the hottest cylinder because it's at the back and
&gt;that bank has to share the airflow with the oil cooler.
&gt;
Colin (amskeptic/Itinerant Air-Cooled guy) disputed the oft-held claim of
cylinder #3 being the hottest when he visited my place last fall. 

He seemed to think that that only held true for Type 1 engines, and on a
Type 4, the #2 cylinder is more prone to overheating and/or valve trouble
as a result. I forget his reasoning. 

Anyway, my CHT gauge is on #3....
