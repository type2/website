Subject: Re: [T2] Think it's time for a new front beam?

&quot;I made quite a dent in the beam today when I did the screwdriver
test on the beam in my 71 westy.

http://wave.prohosting_dot_com/~mrturco/beam/beam.html    &quot;

Has anyone tried pre-treating their 'New' beam from the inside, before 
installing it as a replacement?  What sorts of products would be good for 
this sort of project?  Cosmoline?  I ask because I bought a NOS VW front 
beam last year, and I am considering tackling this project this spring.

ThanksIA

Eron
