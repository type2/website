Hi,

 Dunno about the exact measurements but can you explain why the 
spacers are so bad, when their role is to correct the offset?
 I can see that spacers will increase the strain on the studs 
themselves, as they will have to hold the assmbly together, but
surely once the assembly is, er, assembled the offset will be
correct, the wheel will be centred on the bearings and all will
be well in the world?
 The leverage exerted on the bearings by the lateral (cornering)
forces on the bottom of the tyre will be related to tyre diameter
rather than wheel depth, yes?
 Is there another wear mechanism I'm missing?

 (I am aware that there will be secondary effects caused by using
  wider tyres, lower profiles etc. but I don't think that's caused
  by the use of spacers).

Cheers,
