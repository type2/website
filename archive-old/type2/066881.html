OOOPPSSS!  I just assumed that the Grand Canyon was in Colorado.
It's a good thing I had planned on going to Arizona anyway!   Can
you tell I'm from the &quot;Deep South&quot; and never been out West? 
&lt;sheepish look here&gt;

I suppose a map and a caravan of VWs will be the best thing for someone
who gets lost easily... that is if anyone will want us along after this 
blunder!  :-D  Thanks for the correction, Andrew.
