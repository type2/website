&gt; &gt; Consider the GEX engine to be good enough to haul your new engine home.

&gt; Since this seems to be the general consensus, I really am curious as to what
&gt; kinds of failures we're talking about here? I'm not in physical danger am I?
&gt; :-)

Not unless it chooses to die in a bad neighborhood.

My failure was a loss of ability to idle, probably due to a valve or ring
problem.  GEX engines are built to satisfy their warranty and little more.
As others have pointed out, the typical VW changes hands every year or
two, so it makes little sense to produce a rebuilt engine that lasts
longer than that.  You'd lose sales to subsequent owners.

GEX was also rather reluctant to give me back my core charge, even though
I dropped the core off the day I picked up the rebuilt.  It took several
phone calls to extract a check from them.  Not a good place to do business
with.

George
