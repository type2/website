Subject: Re: [T2] Erratic Idle

Andre,

*Always* deal with the elctrical side first and make sure that it is 
&quot;perfect&quot;.

Do you really have a Holley??  Is this a T4 or T1 engine??
I used to use them a lot(and still like them for T1's).

Next, is the vacuum leaks...they can cause such a thing as well.


Cheers, dave

&gt; My recently acquired 74 camper 'hunts' at idle.  It's not a predictable 

the van timed correctly.  The engine is a newly-rebuilt 1.7L 914 block and 

it has a Holley 2-barrel carb on it (not my first choice but that's what's there.)  

Apart from the idle the van runs very well, accelerates quickly and all that.  
Anybody have any suggestions about the idle?  

I determined that there were some vacuum leaks around the base of the carb 
so I corrected that today.  One of my sparkplug  wires has a badly cracked 
insulator, I'll be getting new wires this week.  

The van has an electric fuel pump, is that a likely suspect?
