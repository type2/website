Build a bigger engine.  Counterbalanced crankshaft.  Have the whole she-bang
balanced.  Run a temp. gauge--when it gets too hot, pull over and idle until it
isn't.  Get your tranny re-geared to &quot;Freeway Flyer.&quot;  Put more money each week
in the &quot;Engine Rebuild Fund Jar&quot; than you otherwise would.  You don't *have* to
switch to an Astro Mommyvan(tm), even though it might be cheaper if you did.
