Subject: Wiring short btw fusebox &amp; battery

&gt;take all the fuses out, (note which ones go where.)
&gt;now check the power should be zero.
&gt;if it isn't you have a wiring short between battery and fusebox

OK, did it again with a better voltmeter, and it ain't zero.

Wiring short btw battery &amp; fusebox, eh?

How the hell can I find out where it is?  I can't even see the &quot;fusebox&quot; on
the wiring diagram.  On the wiring diagram the 12 fuses are all over the
place.

I'm extremely confused and disconsolate.

Even Josh is ready to throw in the towel.
