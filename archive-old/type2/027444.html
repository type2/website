Subject: '78 won't turn over - again

Still won't turn over.   This is a '78 stick FI 2.0 l with a two year 
history of not turning over.  It is easy to start by pushing or coasting a 
short way on a grade and catching in gear, either in 1, 2 or reverse.  It 
use to be an intermittent failure, but I think it is a solid failure today.

History:  I replaced a Ford relay with a new Bosch WR1 relay a week ago!!  
After a wet few days and nice temperature, NOTHING.  I was dead in the water 
in the parking lot last night.

I have two new batteries in parallel, probably 1200+ cold cranking amps.

With failures on last year's Ford relay, I could hear a loud click.   Today, 
with the new WR1 relay, I hear a less noticeable click (is there something 
mechanical in this relay!!) and a 'buzzing' from the starter solenoid.  I 
got the same buzzing when I touched a screwdriver across the two contacts on 
the solenoid yesterday, but nothing happened.  A sparkling type buzzing.

I plan to take voltage readings at various connectors when I get home.  When 
I did this with a past failure, I did see 12+ volts coming out of the wire 
from the starter switch.

This is my third starter/solenoid setup in the past two years.

Perhaps my solenoid is gone.  I hope so (I have an extra setup on the '72).

My question:   How do I bench check the solenoid from my stash, and the one 
on the '78 while it is still installed?  (where is the reference in Bentley 
or Muir).

Other question:  To what do I connect my remote starter push button switch 
so that I can turn over the engine and do a compression check without going 
to the front and turning the key??  I have two alligator clamps on the 
remote switch.

Thanks.
