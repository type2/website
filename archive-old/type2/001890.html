Subject: Re: [T2] carb problem

He said it can't be fixed just adjusted every now 
&gt; and then to minimize the back firing but never stopping it.  Is this true?


Hogwash.  Never heard a backfire out of my bus - single weber, type4 1800.  Nothing ever 'shuts off gas flow completely to the carb' unless you turn off the engine.

Five bucks says your backfiring is an exhaust leak or a timing/vac advance thing.

&gt; I have a 72 bus with a single double barrel carb on it.  Well everytime I 
&gt; completly let off the gas it back fires  He said because it is not a VW carb that when I let off 
&gt; the gas it completly shuts of gas flow to the carb making it back fire on the 
&gt; remaining gas in the carb.  &gt;
