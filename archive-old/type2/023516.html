First, thank you to Joe Mitchell at Busted VW.  Much appreciated on that
axle deal.  What a deal!  You're saving my butt.  My bus is my only vehicle,
so thanks again.
I have a feeling I'm going to learn alot on this replacement.  I'm looking
forward to it actually.  I know its gonna be tough.  
Before I put it in I will also treat it with one of the methods that some
folks have suggested.  Thats the smart thing to do. And I will research the
library before I turn a wrench.  This list is great and you all are so
helpful.
