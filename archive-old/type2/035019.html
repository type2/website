Subject: 2 Westies for sale DC, Balt area

I got a few nibbles the last time I posted to sell these two buses but not 
enough action.  So.....

I've got a 77 Westy that has rust but runs, drives, and camps good. And a 73 
Westy with a strong motor (120-125 compression all around) that would drive 
if I could get the dual carbs set right.(if it's not snowing I'll do that on 
Sat.) Has good canvas. Passenger side has some issues to deal with, but very 
do-able.

I need to start making payments on another car that I bought and no 
reasonable offer will be refused.  I'm not a greedy guy, and I'm a realist 
so come take a look.
