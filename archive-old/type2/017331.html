The Muir book has taught me that I can do it, and that I can probably do
it better than if I were to pay someone.  Before I bought my '77 westy,
I had only owned new cars.  I drove them for 2 or 3 years, took them to
the dealer for service and traded them in.  I realized that I was a pawn
of the marketing machine (that is a whole other rant) and stopped the
cycle by purchasing my bus in 1995.  I had never checked the oil in a
vehicle, I knew nothing at all about how an engine worked.  I broke down
driving my bus home to Atlanta  from Florida where I purchased it, I was
driving 75-80mph, with the air conditioning turned all the way to high,
in 98 degree summer heat.  I laugh now, but that's how clue less I was. 
I bought Muir accidentally because it was the only book on VW's at
Borders when I looked.  

I now do all my own tune-ups, I set my timing, check and adjust my valve
gap, set my points, I do it all and to boot I have taught a couple of
friends how to check and set their valve gap.  That book for all it's
faults and sins of omission has helped me to do what I never thought
possible!  And I have no fear what so ever driving my bus anywhere my
spirit moves me.  I know that should a problem arise that I will be able
to through using the book and this list figure it out. So thanks to both
Muir and all of you.
