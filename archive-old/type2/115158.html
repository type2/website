Subject: Re: [T2] Busted CV???

&gt;From: Oohvwbus_at_aol_dot_com
&gt;
&gt;The wife was driving my bus and busted a CV Joint, assuming that was the 
&gt;only
&gt;prob.  Busted it right off the wheel, Broke the bolts (allen head 
&gt;screws???)
&gt;right off in the wheel. OUCH!!!!!!

With a 25 ft/lb torque spec on the CV bolts, including the original serrated 
lock washers seems to be good idea.  They are easy to loose.  I ordered some 
through a VW dealer. Also don't forget the steel tabs.
