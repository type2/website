&gt;I have to remove pistons and cylinders, decide whether to

&gt;       A local shade tree mechanic said the type 4 pistons and
&gt;       cylinders re-ring up real nice.  Bob in his &quot;jugs&quot; sermon says
&gt;       ring jobs on a VW never work?  Since most of his Sermons deal
&gt;       with type I engines, anyone have an opinion (Bob?) on how the
&gt;       type 4 engines fair, or should I just go for option c:
&gt;  c) buy new pistons and cylinders ($300.00)

If you have the money, the new ones are the safest bet.  I know lots of
people that have honed type 4 cylinders and replaced the rings without
trouble - It's not rocket science.  Of course, one little slip while
assembling the rings can cost you dearly, and if you buy the new pistons
and liners you won't have to deal with that because the rings are already
installed.

&gt;New push rod tubes and seals.

According to the list the Vitron seals are the way to go.

&gt;Clean the heads up.  I have two pair sitting in carb cleaner.  I'll
&gt;wash them in a few days.  Remove the valves and mike them.  Pick the
&gt;best pair (I have two sets) and lap them.  The other pair I'll
&gt;rebuild after this caper is over.

Check them closely for cracks.  Type IV heads crack very easily, usually
from the exhaust seat up into the crown, but also between the valve seats.
The cracks can be hard to see, and will look like a scratch in the metal
until you get the heads really, really clean.

&gt;On both pairs there are a few studs missing! (exhaust on both pair I
&gt;believe)  What can I do about this?

Replace them with new ones.  They are available from the VW parts stores
for cheap.  Stock size is 8mm.  If any holes are stripped, tap them to 10mm
and get studs which are 8mm on one side and 10mm on the other (specially
designed for this purpose).  Don't even think of tapping to 9mm - not
enough difference in diameter.  Replace all of the studs if they are the
least bit rusty or worn.  Locktite the new ones in, get locking brass nuts
and use tons of anti-sieze when you install the heat exchangers.

&gt;Water got inside the crank case when I cleaned it,

Get it out fast, before it rusts things.

&gt;I will also possibly replace the front and rear oil seals.

A good idea.

&gt;No plans to replace my clutch, since it was working fine when I took
&gt;it out.  Maybe this will come back to bite me though...

It won't.  I promise.  :-)

&gt;I think that is about it.  Before installing it into the new bus, I'll
&gt;be cleaning up the engine compartment in that bus,...

I say that every time I remove the engine, and  for whatever reason I'm
always too anxious to get my bus back on the road and I just clean it a
little and install the engine.  I have been good about painting a few
pieces of tin each time it's apart, though, and I almost have them all
looking nice.  If you have the patience, a nice looking engine compartment
is a wonderful thing!!
