Subject: pulling crank gear

Question for you all --

I've been slowly disassembling a 2 liter engine in my spare time, and right now I'm working on the crank.  Last night I pulled the fan hub, removed the circlip, and the brass gear just pulled right off with my hands.  The spacer came off easy, but I couldn't budge the last large gear.  My question is this ---  since I don't really want to take it to a shop to have it hydraulically pressed off, what are my options as far as gear pullers go?  Can I just buy a three-arm rig from Sears?  Will the VW gear puller work (the one that's usually about $50)?  What else is there that would work.  

And secondly,  should the brass distributor gear pull off so easily?  Bentley says it's an .004 interference fit.  

Thanks for the info,

Charles
