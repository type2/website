&gt; Hello everyone,
&gt;
&gt; My '71 bus with stock exhaust occasionally spits out a cloud of smoke when
&gt; started.  It has never happened while starting hot.  It's fairly
&gt; embarrassing (especially after I smoked out that lady walking by one
&gt; afternoon) and I'd like to take care of it.  Does anyone have any ideas to
&gt; the cause of this and what I could do to fix it?

Horizontal engines occasionally leak a bit of oil into the cylinder past
the rings when the ring gaps find their way to the bottom.  this is worse
if the bus is parked leaning to the left or right.  It will usually work
itself out as the rings rotate around randomly.
