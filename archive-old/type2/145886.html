Subject: Re: [T2] Squeek!

Hiya Arnaud,

I don't think I have a problem with a bending chassis due to rust.  This Bus 
is in very good shape with respect to rust and body integrity.  The squeek 
seems to be related to the suspension as it adjusts to rolling over uneven roads. 
 It is squeeking even when the ride in the cabin is pretty even on an 
irregular surface.  

 I'll check the engine to tranny connections tomorrow morning.  Thanks for 
that idea!

Mike
