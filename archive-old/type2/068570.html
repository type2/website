&gt;You could also try to ensure that cold air is not getting in - look at
&gt;window seals, door seals and that draft up your trouser leg because the
&gt;seal is missing around the brake and/or clutch pedal.

I didn't even know there were supposed to be seals here.  I always thought
it was so cool how my cat would jump at the light he saw from the road
whenever I used the clutch- but now that I'm in Wisconsin it's another
story.  Does anyone know where to get these?  and if they're worth it?  It
doesn't seem like I can just stuff insulation there, like I have with every
other conceiveable hole inthe body...  Thanks in advance!
