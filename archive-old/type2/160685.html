Subject: Saturday at the 'yards'

Yesterday was good.

I found a '74 Westy camper with the full width rear z-bed, and a table that
folds against the left side bulkhead, and a cabinet in the left rear over
the spare tire well.  All that is in my house right now, along with a
pristine front bumper and the blue plaid fabric from the smaller topside 2
ft cushion (I couldn't find the 4 ft cushion, or the back cushion)

Now, as I was packing up at the yard, I noticed that the bottom of the upper
bed was made like I have never seen before,  It was solid white 'plastic'
and it looked like it was new, even after thirty some years.  I did not
notice the way the driver / passenger compartment's headliner was
fabricated, but if it was like the rear cargo roof section, I am
definitely pulling ALL the rest of the interior (except for the front
seats.  Don't need or want them)

This did not have the sink cabinet or the cabinet next to the sliding door.
The cargo compartment was pretty much open with lots of floor space..

It does have an air conditioner mounted behind the driver's seat (never seen
that before) , and the compressor was mounted by some butcher!!

The engine is still there less the carbs, but the tranny was
pulled.   (There is a '72 with the carbs pulled, and the air cleaner in tact
but in parts pretty much next to it.)

Oh, and I saw a '80 Vanagon with cruise control (again, never seen that
before)!!  It had a little switch on the brake pedal, so when you pressed
the brake pedal, the switch would be released and probably send a signal to
something in the back.  There were six wires going to the back, and though I
didn't follow them, they seemed to go to some kind of Rube Goldberg
contraption in the Vanagon engine compartment that was able to exert control
on the throttle arm.  Really weird...
