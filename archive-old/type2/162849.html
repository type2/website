&gt;  &gt; a hole burned in a piston



&gt;
&gt;  The normal cause of holes in pistons is timing being off or too lean.

	agreed  -  the point of interest in what I reported is the 
unusual cause viz. blockage of cooling-air intake


&gt;  it could be that the water injection caused a lean condition.

	unheard of  -  WI decreases temps without changing mixture 
(if put in after the petrol, which is where I do it)


&gt;  on rebuilding the motor you would be better off getting a set of 
&gt;rods that have been rebuilt

	no hint of harm to rods, so we're slapping in new big- &amp; 
small-end bearings, i.e. rebuilding the rods ourselves


&gt;  and replacing the pistons and clylinders with new.

	seems difficult to get just one cyl + piston anyhow


&gt;  I would also recommend rebuilding your heads at the least 

	for sure

thanx
