Yep, you sure got to realise that when you give info. out or make any firm 
statement, that someone or a lot of people ,will challange you on what you 
said, will make snide coments and will end up with you never wanting to say 
anything again. You got to have very tough skin to participate in groops 
that dicuss things like politics, religon, morality, and even VW repair. 
Ever try selling on Ebay? The questions will drive ya nuts. There is always 
someone who will argue for the sake of something to do that get their 
adrennelin pumpin, to get their &quot;high on&quot;. Thick skin I tell ya, thick skin.
