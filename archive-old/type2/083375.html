Subject: RE: [T2] Gathering group to help engine drop  (Troy's bus)

&gt; I was told by someone that it has to be split to replace either the main
&gt; or rear main seal.  Can't remember which one.  I personally do not know
&gt; what needs to be done.  (I have been reading the engine drop procedure
&gt; in Bentley and stuff in the archives and have not run by this either.)
&gt; If that person is wrong, that would be fine by me.  :)

No troy thats only to replace the galley plug if its leaking or popped
out, not the crank seals.
