&gt; I have replaced two Bosch ECU's and perhaps a dozen of other manufacture

&gt; paid for that
&gt; one. Others have come to me from an ECU replacment at another shop to fix
&gt; the problem that the ECU had nothing to do with.

hi doktortim...

well, my point was based on the expense of a tow, the time waiting for
a part that is unavailable locally where you happen to have broken down.
my selection of an ECU was kind of random and not the main thrust of what
i was saying...

I am familiar with FI and realize the ECU rarely goes bad... but it can.
Lets use another FI part then that does fail regularly... how about an
AFM.  those are known to go south rather suddenly, i have heard of several
failing...

would that be a better example.  How about a double relay or a resistor
pack...  maybe a CHT sensor or a cold start injector. what about my
carbeurator and cv joint example, were not those valid points? even though
those components rarely fail they can.  I always carry spare wheel
bearings, you never know when one might go south with the spotty quality
of many parts on the market today.

even a generator pulley going bad can cost you two days and a tow. 
Doesnt matter if the monetary value of the part isnt high, the problem is 
you might have to wait for it to come from a mail order house in another
state.

On my last road trip i had an exhaust stud fall out.  Since i had one in
my spares box i fixed it in a half an hour in the motel parking lot, no
need to search for metric studs of the proper length... just BOOM its
fixed.

The spares i carry are small and take up less than the lower half of the
rearmost compartment in my so67 (68 westy) interior.  All of them will
save me a tow and price gouging from locals because i need to get where im
going. (extra coil $4 at junkyard... probably cost you $20 at autozone,
and mines a bosch.  itll save a tow...)

It takes up so little space to carry a few essential spares that i see no
reason not to.  Obviously things like spare heads etc. would only really
be needed when one was venturing far away from a tow or any assistance...
but a spare coil? it takes no more space than a can of soda.

Are you opposed to carrying spares like extra brake fluid? extra oil?
extra spark plugs... extra fan belts, accelerator cable and clutch cable 
wiring stuff etc.?

i was a boy scout at one time and i like their motto... be prepared.
(plus my stash of spares sometimes gives me the opportunity to help
others... once i sold my spare clutch cable to a guy going cross country..
another time a spare clutch cable helped out a good friend and got me an
almost free t-shirt)

peas,

Steve
