Subject: RE: [T2] The new pertronix ignitor II, and the 009 problems

What you said is correct and reflects my understanding based on the book I 
have for performance Corvairs.

&gt;No, What the Ignitor II does is have active variable dwell. In simple
&gt;english, dwell controls the electrical saturation of the coil. You want the
&gt;coil to be a full saturation so that, when it discharges, it gives you the
&gt;hottest and longest lasting spark. With points ignition and the Ignitor I
&gt;ignition dwell is a set number; therefore your ignition is only optimized at
&gt;a particular RPM. The Ignitor II has electronics in it that varies the dwell
&gt;so that you achieve coil saturation at a wide range of engine RPMs. If your
&gt;planning to run a capacitive discharge the Ignitor II probably isn't better
&gt;than an Ignitor I since coil saturation is controlled by a different device.

Ciao!
