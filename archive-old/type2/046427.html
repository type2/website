I was just going from memory there...and I haven't driven Stella in about a
month... maybe a bit more :(  She gets to live it up again this weekend though
for a campout!  woo hoo!
I have a tach in my 71 ( stella ) and it reads just a little over 4,000 RPM at
75... so my speedo probably reads about 3-4 mph off.  Oh well...I'm happy enough
just thinking I'm doing 75mph :)  She keeps up with traffic rather nicely....and
I really like that about her.  oh yeah.... I run 195/75R14 tires on her too...
The 62 sports 165SR15 Pirelli tires....but those were on it when I got it.  I
even have the receipt from when they were bought :)

&gt; If the transaxle is stock and the tires are correct size [185R14 Reinforced]
&gt; your '71 will run ~70 MPH _at_ 4,000 RPM.
&gt;
&gt; That's _true_ MPH, on a calibrated/corrected speedometer.  Indicated MPH
&gt; could be as high as 95 MPH :)
