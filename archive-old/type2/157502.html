Subject: Re: [T2] Heat

I have enclosed the area between the two dfront seats
and inside that enclosure is where I mounted the
heater originally. I now have my heater that operates
off the coolant from the Subaru motor mounted in that
location. When I finally get around to re-installing
the Espar, I will likely build a box underneath to
mount it in. They must be mounted in a protected
location. Clearance requirements are really minimal. I
cut a hole in the floor and the fuel hookup and
exhaust are both outside of the vehicle (required).

My only problem was that I used a boat tank that draws
fuel from the bottom of the tank up through about a
half inch diameter stand tube and then I connected to
it with a quick disconnect fitting. The thing draws so
little fuel - about a teaspoonful in about ten minutes
- that the minute leaks in the fittings and the volume
that the standpipe holds were defeating the pumps
ability to overcome. I ran it lean and had a problem!

I would definitely use a tank with a gravity outlet to
hook the pump to. One more thing: The pump needs to be
away from where you sleep! I had it mounted in the
engine compartment and that was directly below my bed.
It isn't loud in the daytime amidst other activities,
but in the dead of night it's a reminder of life in
the city!I had it rubber mounted and it still kept me
awake. Next time it's going up front! -BaH

&gt; Where did you install it on your bus?  I've
&gt; occasionally thought about
&gt; getting one of these and putting it in the same
&gt; place the current gas heater
&gt; is installed.  The BA6 works great, but it is
&gt; getting to be old, requires
&gt; maintenance and I occasionally worry about cracks
&gt; letting exhaust
&gt; recirculate in the cab.
