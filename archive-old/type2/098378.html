Subject: Re: [T2] refirbishing EGR filter, One question

Hey Karl,

Thanks for the reply and reassurance. When I took
apart my fi, I cleaned out that tube in the plenum
before I repainted the plenum. I also made sure that
the tube that goes from the EGR valve to the EGR
filter was cleaned out and not pluged. I have been
looking for replacement gaskets for my EGR system like
the one that you mentioned. Do you know a source for
them?  If I can find some one that sells them I would
like to replace all of the gaskets in my EGR system. I
want to try to eliminate all possible vacuum leaks in
the fi and I know that if the EGR system is leaky,
then you run into running problems. I tried the Bus
depot, but so far, they don't list any for a bus, just
for a Vanagon and beetle.

Thanks again!!!

David Kelly
