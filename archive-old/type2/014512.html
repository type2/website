Subject: Re: Hydralic Lifters.... HELP

I've spent the last six months figuring out my HYD lifter problem - and
actually finally fixed it today!

If the oil is dirty - change it.  Don't use a really thick oil w/ HYD lifters.
I'd try adjusting them before you decide whether or not it is sticking - it
may not have been adjusted initially!

Adjustment procedure -
- engine completely cold! NOT OPTIONAL!
- point the rotor to the cyl. you want to adjust (TDC I think)
- the rocker arms should be relaxed - not pressing too much on the valve
- loosten the adjuster nut, taking care not to turn the adjustment screw
- back off the adjustment screw, count the turns just to see if it was out of
adjustment
- now here comes the odd part for hyd. lifters - you actually compress the
valve a little bit to adjust them!
- back out the screw until there is a little slack in the rocker arm (see way
bottom for what to do if there is no slack in the rocker arm even with the
screws out all the way, that was my problem for the past 6 months!), pull back
on the top of the rocker arm so the gap is between the screw and the valve,
turn the screw in with your hand until it barely touches the valve, then turn
the screw 1.5 to 2 turns in (depending on the manual and mechanic!), make sure
you leave a little room for the screw to turn when you tighten the nut
- see if that helped!

- you can try and tap the lifter in a little bit also and see if it really is
sticking

If your lifters are still sticking and noisy then pull off that rocker arm,
the push-rod and the tubes and use a magnet or something to try and get the
lifter out.  Clean off the lifter and the bore which it rides in - I don't
know what to use, but something not too abrasive and something that won't
leave grit behind.

While you're in there, check the lift on your cam to make sure you don't have
worn down lobes.

If all of this fails, try replacing the supposed problem lifters - all 8 will
run around 80 dollars.

Low oil pressure will also cause the valves to not pump up fully and be noisy!

WHAT TO DO IF THERE IS NO SLACK IN THE ROCKER ARMS - this was my problem,
after getting my heads rebuilt, the valve stems were too long and the rocker
arm itself would be compressing the valves even when the adjuster screw was
out all the way!  To solve this you can buy spacers to go behind where the
rocker arms mount - they make different sizes just for this purpose - put
larger and larger ones in there until there is slack in the rocker arms and
adjust away!

Good luck -
