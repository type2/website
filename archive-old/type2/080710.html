&gt; &gt;&gt;...sounds like the castoring action of the wheels has not been set
&gt; correctly...&lt;&lt;
&gt;
&gt; is there in fact a way to adjust this spec?
&gt;
&gt; anyone?

Driving over railroad tracks at high speed does it for me.
Otherwise, there is no castor adjustment on the bus.
It's machined in and you take what you get.
