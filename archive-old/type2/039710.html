The Neandereers should have gone on strike when marketing said, &quot;Make
wizbang or else!!&quot; They should have had the strenght of conviction to chose
else. &quot;To hell with your wizbang, or else!!&quot;
That they knuckled under and gave in just demonstrates they are as human as
any other ape, and knew not what they did.
