well, im doing the few things i feel comfortable with while i wait for
wilson and bentley to arrive from b &amp; n.  i took off the valve cover on
the right (of the van) and caught the oil with it, this is what i found:
definitely some gasoline mixed in with the oil. also, a lot of little
(dust-like sparkles) metal particles mixed in with the oil as well. they
_are_ magnetic....if that means anything...do the metal particles mean
anything? and what? and how do i fix this? i also need new heater boxes,
cables, and tubes...but all of that can wait 'til she is running well
again =)  should i be able to see from under the engine to inside the
engine compartment? i mean, there is an area around the engine and
behind the fan that i think is supposed to be closed with a seal, but
either the seal isnt there, or isnt doing a good job..? thank you very
much in advance!
