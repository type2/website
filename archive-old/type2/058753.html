You wrote   &gt;Can anyone tell me how much grease the front beam takes in total.
I haven't
greased it before and I don't want to (a) buy too little and have to go
back to the shop half way through or (b) buy too much and have it
sitting around for a year.&lt;

I recently greased the front end of my '68 that had been sitting idle for
about 17-18 years (!!!) before I got it.  I put in about 1 1/2 tubes (14 oz
ea) of grease (total for 5 fittings) until I saw clean grease.  I checked the
archives and found a couple of entries that also used about that much for all
5 fittings.  I'd get 2 tubes and you'll have some left over.

Remember to jack up the fron end!
