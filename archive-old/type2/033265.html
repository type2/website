Subject: custom westy cabinet handles

hello boys and girls,

i'm in the middle of a resto/custom restoration on a 71 ex sunroof/soon to be 
sunroof-westy. and i've been toying with the idea of casting and producing a 
hand full of solid aluminum westy cabinet handles, which could then be brushed 
or polished. they would be like exactly like the original, push button grey or 
black plastic ones, but they would be metal instead. 

so i was just wondering if anyone would be interested in getting a set for 
themselves. if so drop me a pmail. i'm not sure how soon i'm going to do it, but 
if the interest is there i might do it soon.

i'm also thinking about doing the sunroof handle, but i'm not sure. does any 
know if the bus and bug share the same handle? if so i might be more inclined. 
otherwise i'm not sure if it's worth it.

anyway if you're interested drop me a line - veedub_at_odometer_dot_org

thanks
andrew
