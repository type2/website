So here's an update on the brake light fuse.

Spent all afternoon tracing wires, checking grounds, killing the battery,  charging
battery, burning finger on fuse as it blew, replacing headlight switch, tail light
assemblies (Brazilian until I find some good OEM ones), swearing, etc...

The last thing I decided to check was the fuse panel itself.  I removed the screws,
turned it around and lo and behold, fried wires so bad that they were melted to one
another. (terminals 11&amp; 12) Unstuck them and tried the fuse, (my last good one) ,
crossed my fingers and stepped on the pedal...  Brake Lights!!!

I surly would have smelled that meltdown if I was driving.  I think it was like that for
years and it finally decided to start acting up.
Now I have the ardous task of replacing all those melted wires.  Not looking foreward to
that but I know I have to.  Another day...

Thanks for the help volks.  Yes the problem was before the switches on the Master
Cylinder.
