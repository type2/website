Hi Volks,

Dave Burden &lt;Dave.Burden_at_digital_dot_com&gt; wrote to the List:
&gt; I was out at lunch today looking at utility trailers
&gt; for our '72 Bus.  I need one to haul the Isetta once
&gt; in awhile and just for making Home Depot runs
&gt; and stuff like that.
[...]
&gt; Am I looking for trouble hauling 1500 lbs behind the Bus?
&gt; Will having brakes on the trailer make this setup okay?

I don't know how much exactly one of your lbs is, 
but here in Germany buses are legally allowed to pull
as follows (IIRC about the years, trailer with brakes):

68-71, type 1 engine:   800 kg
72-75, type 1 engine:   800 kg (but can be upped to 1,200 kg)
72-75, type 4 engine: 1,200 kg
76-79, type 1 engine:   800 kg (but can be upped to 1,400 kg)
76-79, type 4 engine: 1,200 kg (but can be upped to 1,800 kg)

I never heard about electric brakes though.  Our 
trailers here have a clever mechanism that senses when 
the trailer starts to push the bus instead of being 
pulled by it, and applies the brakes according to that 
pressure.  A PITA when reversing, but works well otherwise.  
The weight limit for trailers without brakes is 600 kg 
regardless of engine type and bus vintage here.

Personally I'd not go far beyond 1,000 kg even with a
type 4 engine, at least not regularly.  My 72 panel,
type 1 engine, feels somewhat stressed with an empty
500 kg car hauling trailer, at least uphill.  With
a type 1 engine, I'd say 800 kg is about the limit I'd
normally want to pull, in order to be able to manage
normal autobahn hills in 4th without the need for full
throttle.  YMMV.  (You just have to get used to the
sight of a huge truck grille in the mirrors.  Trailer
speed limit is 50 mph here, and the bus with trailer
won't be happy at more than that.)

If you don't have hills, you might be content with
pulling more.  And of course, in emergencies even a 
type 1 engine will pull 1,800 kg and more... just 
how fast and how far is the question.  :-)

Airhowlingly yours,
    Erik.
