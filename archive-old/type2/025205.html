Has anyone had any luck getting a complete Mexican engine including tin and
fuel injection?  Just like the engines they put in the new Mexican bXXtles.
I have seen a couple of these cars and it looks like the engine would be an
easy fit in a bus.  They are basically a 70's bXg engine with modern
injection.  I have contacted one the bXXtle importers and haven't got any
response.
