X-Diagnostic: MESSAGE MAY NOT BE TOPICAL
 sale(34ICTs)

Hello all,
  In case you have been trying to contact me, my computer has been on the
fritz. So I ordered a new one and the cows just finished with it and droped it
off.
  I also just traded the remains of my 71 Westy (minus parts requested) for a
beat 8? Vanagon Diesel with no engine or trans. However, I did get the complete
mounting system, hoses, brackets and everything diesel except the engine block,
oil pan, and oil pump. I did not need the trans, as my Vanagon is an Auto. So
now I have the start of what I need to put that 2.0L Jetta Motor in. But I do
still need the il pan and pump/pickup tube. If you have one of these, or know
where to get on, please contact me. I am in no rush, but will want to scrounge
these up in the next 6mo or so. I do not have the engine or adapter yet. 
  I am getting low on 71-73 Bus parts, but I do have tons of engine stuff for
both upright and type 4s. I have several good cases, cranks, heads, some tin,
fans. I may even be able to be talked out of my Weber 34ICTs for the right
offer. I need to get the Vanagon fixed up more than I need the Webers. These
fit a type 4.
  I may entertain trades for a 1.8 Rabbit GTI engine, 2.0L Jetta motor, Diesel
oil pan and pickup, or other stuff.
