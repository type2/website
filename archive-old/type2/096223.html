&gt; &gt;BTW--I paint for a living--and not houses--

and I'm an engineer and use a computer pretty heavily and fume about folks
that use M$ outta the box (sort of the GEX of software) 

BUT

we each have our own set of values and constraints.  I live downtown in
the big city.  Don't have a lot in the back full of parts nor can I leave
my bus sit very long even though it is in front of my garage behind my
house.  and to add to the constraints, when the bus don't go, I go by bus.

so paint it, sure. but it needs to be done in such a manner that I can get
up tommorrow morning and drive it to work.....!?   so all jobs possible
are done in real little pieces.  my bus got painted over 9 days during one
nice month in spring.  the bus has 9 distinct sections (3 each side, nose,
back, roof)  I did one section at a time.   must have looked really
strange while working on it.   have a nice spray gun but the set up/clean
up time made it a non starter for this job.  so I bought literally cases
of good quality rattle can automotive custom colors.   I think it turned
out pretty good and I never took it off the road.  sure I could have done
better myself, IF fixing VW vans was my job or my passion, but I just like
a dern cost effective piece of well made machinery, thus I have own many
VWs' (one at a time) and am on my 4th bus  all daily drivers and only
vehicles.
