Subject: Re: [T2] CHT gauge and senders.

I allways thought that #3 cyl ran the hotest. That is where I put the temp 
sending wire under the sparkplug between the plug and the washer. Is that 
not where the valve seat usually drops from first because of the #3 not 
being cooled as well as the other cylinders?  Cree 79 Bay
