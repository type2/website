Subject: [T2] Auto tranny problems.

I've just replaced the beaten and worn twin carb setup on my auto bus
('73, 1700cc) with a 32/36 Weber from a Ford engine ($25 from a scrap
yard.)  It works just fine, if anyone's interested in details, please
contact me.

Having done this, the only cuplrit left in my stalling problem is the
auto tranny itself.

The transmission drives fairly well, engaging a little heavily but
driving just fine, for the first 15 minutes of operation.  After that it
begins to engage very heavily, and slowing down to a halt or any slow
speed maneuvering becomes a juggling act, driving with both feet and
three hands.  The drag from the transmission appears to be enough to
stall the engine, which would normally tick over just fine.

I know very little about ATs, but I'm willing to do as much spannering
as I can in order to get the bus in such a condition that my wife feels
happy driving it.

TIA,

Chris.
