Subject: RE: [T2] 69 Bus master cyilnder resovior

I'm not looking for the master brake cylinder, I'm
looking for the brake fluid reservoir that sits inside
the cab above the clutch pedal.

I've tried all places that people have recommended
before submitting to this list, but to no avail.

Has anyone used one from another model or year to
substitute for the 69 bus brake fluid reservoir ?

thx,

rudy
