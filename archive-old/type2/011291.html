Subject: More on tires

I bought from Discount Tires here in SLC,UT.  I put on 4 Yokohamas Y356
load range C 185R-14.  With the disposal fees and a lifetime spin 
balance( plan on powder coating my rims in the future:) ) and something called 'certificates' _at_ 7.50 X 4 came out to $347.  The load range C
was at about 1600 lbs. per tire!
