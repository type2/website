Subject: Re: [T2] Optima batteries for starting

I agree that they are good as deep discharging batteries but I must point 
out that two important characteristics of AGM (absorbed glass mat) 
batteries such as the Optima are:

1.  Long shelf life (low internal discharge rate)
2.  Very high discharge rate capability

Much better than flooded batteries on both counts.  I could argue that they 
make much better starting batteries than flooded, but the fact is that they 
are just better all-around than flooded batteries, which are decidedly 
old-tech.  Some cars do come with this battery standard (the Mazda Miata 
comes to mind).  And those porta-power devices?  The relatively small boxes 
you can carry around and jump-start your vehicle with?  They all contain 
AGM batteries.

In my bus, the starting battery is a 50 amp-hour AGM and the aux battery is 
a 75 amp-hour AGM.  I have more aux batteries but don't carry them all the 
time.  I have never ever had a starting problem with these batteries, and 
they provide noticeably more cranking speed on below-freezing mornings.
