Subject: Re: Speaker location, friday question

Dear Stray,

I don't have speakers in the rear, though I have a fader. What I did with
the &quot;rear&quot; speaker wires was to solder 'em up to a female headphone jack.
Right now it dangles a bit under the dash, but I found some really neat
holes in the dash metal under the glove box that look like they were meant
to house this headphone jack. The next solstice will see the jack get
mounted there.

Now, I can... er... my PASSENGERs can plug in and hear nothing but pure,
unadulterated music.

Let's not forget California Vehicle Code 27400... thou shalt NOT do the
above, if you are the driver of the vehicle. This law is so you can hear
emergency vehicles.

Now, there's a set of &quot;sports&quot; headphones that are rather silver
(inconspicuous), and drape over behind the ears and around the back of your
neck.

Here's my plan - don't tell ANYONE.

If (when..) I get the red lights flashing behind me, I keep driving UNTIL HE
TURNS ON HIS SIREN, at which point I pull over. See? I prance into court
spewing on about the &quot;intent of the law&quot; and so forth, and smugly ask the
officer at what point I pulled over. Eh??? That RIGHT your honor... when he
HIT HIS SIREN !!!

So SHE sez... $50 fine and a point. Good day. NEXT !!

&gt; It being friday, thought I'd ask this: Where are you people with westys
&gt; mounting your rear speakers? I just got a rather pithy deal on a nice cd
&gt; player, and the front speaker location is rather obvious&lt;in the doors&gt; but
&gt; the rears have got me a bit stumped.
&gt; Thank you all,
