&gt; Hi volks,
&gt;
&gt; Here's a new question on the same theme....
&gt;
&gt; How many HP does it consume to spin a higher-rated alternator? Is
&gt; there a known Amp-per-HP ratio???
&gt;
&gt; A basic rule of physics tells me that there's no such thing as a free
&gt; lunch. So what's it do to throttle response when you add an extra 20A
&gt; of elctrical capacity?

746W=1HP.

20Ax13.4v=268W

268/746=0.36HP

(and that is assuming that you are using a full 20A all the time, which
isn't likely!
