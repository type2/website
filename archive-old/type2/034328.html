What is the ambient air temperature?  Is the manifold preheat system
working properly?  My bus exhibits these symptoms occasionally in the
winter (below 40 degrees F ambient).  My thought is that the high vacuum in
the manifold at fast idle may cause some icing.  One clue would be the
behavior after the vehicle is warmed up say, another 5 minutes - after the
engine heat has had time to soak up through the manifold.  Does the problem
go away?  Or does it die forever thereafter?
