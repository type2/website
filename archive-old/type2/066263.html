&quot;Joseph F. Fournier II&quot; &lt;jfourni_at_COMP.UARK.EDU shared with us that he
painted his own bus.

VanBondo plans on following Joe's lead when it comes time to paint the '57
single cab. I admit to going overboard on the '67 Westy but it is turning
out really nice. I have learned what it takes to do one &quot;right.&quot; Dwyer
Lytles' option sounds like a pretty fair compromise as well.
In retrospect, I would have been just as happy &lt;if not better off&gt; taking
the time and dollars spent on the paint job and invested in a tools which
could have been used again and again, ala the Fitzpatrick method, learned
what I could and simply enjoy the camper to the degree of perfection that I
was to achieve. Thom on the other hand is totally outta control IMHO ;-).
