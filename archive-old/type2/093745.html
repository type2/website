Subject: Re: [T2] Cantrell's tome on aux battery and relay

There's a simple and very reliable alternative to all this confusion about dual batteries and how they should be connected and used, etc.

Go to a marine supply and buy a CG-approved battery switch for dual batteries.  The switch will have settings for #1 [main battery], #2 [auxiliary battery], ALL, and OFF.  You can also get a locking version of these switches for added security.

Mount the switch where it's handy for you.  Some folks put it under the back seat or seat/bed [be sure to use grommets where cables pass through sheet metal].  Make the connections to batteries, switch, and ground with battery cables.

For &quot;normal&quot; operations turn the switch to #1.  That battery will charge and discharge independently.  

When you stop to camp, etc., turn the switch to #2 and run all your lights and accessories from the auxiliary battery.  The main battery will be completely isolated.    

When it's time to move on, turn the switch to #1 and start the engine.  Once the engine is running you can switch back to #2 and re-charge the auxiliary battery while you drive.

If conditions warrant you can turn the switch to ALL and use both batteries to start the engine, or charge both batteries simultaneously.

Use the OFF setting for security when leaving the bus/camper unattended.  The electrical systems will be completely disconnected from both batteries.

These switches have a service life measured in decades, are non-sparking, and safe in high heat environments.  Their only &quot;shortcoming&quot; is that they are not &quot;automatic&quot; - one must remember to set the switch for each situation.  But this allows the operator freedom to manage/manipulate the vehicle's electrical system with just a twist of the wrist, arguably a &quot;good thing&quot;...
