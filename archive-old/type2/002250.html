&gt;As a final note, can anyone tell me where in Niagara Fall is the 13th
Annual
&gt;June Jitter Bug being held.



Oooops...I didn't realize that they didn't have directions on the website.
The Jitterbug is being held at Fireman's Park in Niagara Falls.

&gt;From the Peace Bridge in Fort Erie, take the QEW just past Niagara Falls,
exit at Mountain Rd. West...Firemans Park is just down the road.

&gt;From the Rainbow Bridge in Niagara Falls, New York...Make a right onto Falls
Ave.  Stay on that until you are on highway 420.  Take the 420 to the QEW
Toronto and exit Mountain Rd. W.

Here is my original post with Jitterbug content...

&gt; I hope to meet some listees this coming weekend (June 20) at the June
&gt;Jitterbug, http://www.johnsbugshop_dot_com/page24.html , it was a great turn
out
&gt;last year...

&gt;The event is located in Niagara Falls, Ontario...about 25 minutes from
&gt;Buffalo, New York.   more info at the above link.  If your are coming let
me
&gt;know so I can be on the look out...I'll be there with Caroline (Red
&gt;Westy)...
