Subject: [T2] Westy water tank wanted - '79

If has or comes across a water tank for a '76-'79 Westy I am in need of one.

I tried repairing mine using suggestions from list members, but nothing was
strong enough.
The crack in my tank is right at the threaded hole for the water pump, and
that is just too
stressful an area to repair. A product from Loctite (I think it was called
Plastik??) worked
pretty well and would be a good repair glue for a crack anywhere but the
threaded water
pump hole. In fact with a clamp and glue repair job, my tank stopped
leaking, but I am
not confident that it is a long term fix. I would hate to have to remove and
repair the water
tank again, so I would prefer to replace mine.

In So Cal.
