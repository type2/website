Subject: Re: [T2] Feeling Frustrated

Hi Mark,

$1200 to have someone pull the engine and replace a cylinder head is a 
bit dear, but not all that far out of line. Figure on about 8 hours 
labour, plus parts. It's possible that you *MAY* be able to replace the 
valve, but more commonly the valve is fine, and the valve seat is 
what's knackered. Either way, the head has to come off, and that's an 8 
hr job to re-and-re.

Once the engine is down and the head is off, you can get a close look 
at it. If it's cracked, you'll need it welded or replaced. Hopefully 
the shop that did the compression test would have set the valves first, 
and if so then they probably already know what the condition of the 
head is. Which may account for the high price on the quote.

If you're comfortable pulling heads and lapping valves then get 
yourself some decent metric wrenches and the Bentley type2 manual. Drop 
the engine, pull the head, and tell us what you're looking at. You can 
save at LEAST half of that $1200 if you're willing to drop the engine 
and pull the head yourself.

Happy trails,

Greg Potts

&gt; was told $1200. In the past I would just pull the head and replace the
&gt; bad valve, lapping it into place.
