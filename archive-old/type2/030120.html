Karl, folks,

I am sorry... that was not too clear.  What I meant was:

For Vanagon owners, I recommend this switch next time you need to do
anything with your front wheel bearings that requires removing and
replacing the peen nut.

For bay owners, the change is (a) not necessary and (b) not possible. As
Karl says, the left side is left hand threaded on bays, but not on V'gons.
This is fine, as the split nuts on bays have always worked just fine for
me.  

The reason I pointed the page out to bay owners is that the processes are
similar.  Same dust cap removal tip applies to both the bay and Vanagon.  
Similar speedometer cable set up. The split nut on the bay takes an M6
Allen wrench, the MBZ nut takes an M5, but the process is the same.

&gt; &gt; I highly recommend this replacement!  I believe it will be far more secure
&gt; &gt; than the original VW peen nut.  Even if you own a bay, I recommend looking
&gt; at the page because the structure of the front axle stub did not change that
&gt; much.
&gt; 
&gt; You will have a little problem on the left side of a bay..... they are
&gt; left-hand thread. Sorry, the M-B nuts are all right hand.
&gt; And the correct Allen wrench is 5mm. :))
