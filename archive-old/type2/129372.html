Subject: Re: [T2] Hitch Prototype

I would think that's kinda close.  Especially if you get some flex in
that crossbar.. and then if your engine moves around, the exhaust will
be tapping on the hitch.

&gt; Hi folks,
&gt; I spent the day designing and building a wooden model of a hitch.  I was pleased with the outcome (even though I did not have a 2X2
&gt; to represent the crossbar.  My question is:  do you think the receiver is to close to my exhaust?  It's maybe 1/2 inch.  I could go
&gt; with a 1 1/4 inch receiver and gain 3/4 inch.  Let me know.  Thanks!
