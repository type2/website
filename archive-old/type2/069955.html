Subject: Re: Platinum plugs?

&lt;&lt;I have heard, though, that platinum plugs will stick in cylinder heads and
will become nigh on impossible to remove.  (They last tens of thousands of
miles (in a healthy engine)&gt;&gt;

That's one of the reasons that VW suggested to remove them at the intervals
they specified, not doing so leads to frozen plugs and stripped threads...
Unfortunately... The only experience i have with the Platinums is in a
Japanese 4x4, result: hotter, flat spots, when we put the NGK (or
Nippon Denso, i don't recall) back all went back to normal. I would
never use anything other than stock Bosch W8AC, or W175T, or was it W275T,
don't remember, I've had *bad* experiences with Champion L88, L87 and L86, NGK
and Nippon Denso in aircooled VWs, for me: Bosch for German cars, NGK or
Nippon Denso for Japanese cars and maybe Chapion for Detroit Iron, i thought
that the American engine use plugs with huge gaps... I also don't like
Champion's packaging, if you drop one you can be sure that the electrode
bends, Bosch and the Japanese use carton tubes to protect the adjustments,
I never had a bad out-of-the-box Bosch, i did have quite a few Champions
and one Nippon Denso that just shorted or whatever they did to prevent
the cylinder in which they were mounted from doing its job.
A modified engine may require a colder plug, use Bosch W6AC and see if
it still burns clean properly.
