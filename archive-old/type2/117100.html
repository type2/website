Subject: What exactly is this?

Vibration Damper, 6 pieces, 72-79 Bus, 80-83 2L Vanagon
 021 101 107/6

Part listed at Bus Depot that I am trying to figure out what it exactly is.
Do I have this on my 78' Westy?

&gt; The
vibration dampner mounts directly on the engine case in the area of the
engine mounts, and reduces the vibration of the main bearings.&lt;

Thats the description I got from e-mailing BD.

&gt;and the vibration
dampner
is a kit with six pieces.  This will solve the problem of hood vibration
from the engine.&gt;

This was the first response I got when I asked about this part. Any help I
can get to reduce my main bearing and hood vibration would be greatly
appreciated...
