Subject: [T2] Clutches revisited for the challenged.

My 70 swing Bug uses the earlier style clutch. Can I use the later clutch
which is stronger in it, in any way??

Without buying a Kennedy 1700, what is the strongest clutch I can readily
buy from SoCal or somebody? Is the Transporter or Porsche clutch plate
stronger?
Spring centre disc for it or solid for a 1776 110cam Kadron power??

And to guru's like Bill May etc, how do I know which SuperDiff to buy, the
threaded one or the snap ring one, and how do I know????

Many thanks again for the 1297th time,
Courtney
