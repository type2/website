Subject: Re: [T2] Burned wires

Okay,
     Finally got the email problems worked out and just got the pictures in.
I re-examined the pictures and the wire in question is NOT the positive
battery lead which is supposed to lead to the starter.

here is the first pic

This is looking down into engine hatch.  You can see the positive cable
just to the left of the other red wire which is leading into the voltage
regulator.

heres the second pic

Sorry bout the angle.  I didn't get the connection where this wire comes
into the harness that connects into the alternator, I am going to try and
get some better pictures tomorrow.

Anyone got any ideas?

ps. viva la zachula_dot_com!  Gmail is nice but I prefer my own server :-)

&gt; check around starter.. make sure nothing is touching metal or grounded
&gt; out..
&gt;   also check to make sure there are no bare places now in all of your
&gt; wireing harness.. dont take much to melt a little bit off the wire/s
&gt; in one or more places to make it ground out again... good luck and yes
&gt; post pics so we can see~!~

&gt;   I believe that this is what happened however I did not have to
&gt; disconnect
&gt; the battery to make it stop. It looks like the wire just got really hot.
&gt; No other wires seem to be affected, just the one heading to the starter
&gt; so I am not so sure that its shorted out since it stopped shorting when
&gt; I turned the bus off.
&gt;
&gt; I am still waiting for pictures and hopefully I can provide some later
&gt; today.
