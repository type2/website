&gt; There are two bench seats in the back and it came with lots of spare parts. 
&gt;  Does anybody need cargo area floor mats with bench seat cutouts (have 2 
&gt; spares)?

I could use one of those cargo area mats! What kind of shape are they in? The amt 
would be destined for my 60' Kombi so I assume that it wouldn't be a perfect fir but 
I think I could prolly make it work. What kinda $ would you want for one of those?
