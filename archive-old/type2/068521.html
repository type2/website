&gt;&gt;&gt;Please excuse the intrusion, but I REALLY NEED HELP!!!!! My
&gt;&gt;&gt;man and I are
&gt;&gt;&gt;busy converting a 1974 (or thereabouts) VW Kombi from air to
&gt;&gt;&gt;water cooled.
&gt;&gt;&gt;Our problems are:
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;  Kim - I sent you out a post but it bounced right back.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Anyone else get thru?
&gt;
&gt;No such subscriber, no such domain. No such domain as ICONO.CA either. Her
&gt;message was composed with Chameleon which argues that she posted from the
&gt;web page, where she might read replies. If it's not all a cruel joke.

Hi Ken

Your message made me read the return address. Both you and the sender got
it wrong. The domain is ICON.CO.ZA  , which comes from Internet Connection
in South Africa. This *is* a real domain. So, if you can help these folks,
please don't hesitate to reply to cactus_at_icon.co.za (and don't forget to
berate them about the importance of no typos in return address;-)
