Subject: Re: [T2] Heater

wish i could remember where my friend theo lives... he lives on one of
the islands but i dont remember which one. his mother lives on another
island so i would probably get a real nice island tour... AND IN
BUGASAURUS, TOO! it is an AWESOME baja bug! i could stop to see him and
you and then off to OZ to see my best friend J in melbourne, richard in
brisbane and chris in sydney!!! wow, call it the chrisbus world tour!!!
hey, then i can go to germany to see my friends martin and ingo and stop
by the vw museum!!! now, if only i had the money to drive across town,
much less travel 'round the world...

wavin, stuck at home and dreaming about seeing the world,
