&gt; Well, if you moved the ductwork about a foot to the left you could

I did the under floor spare in my 65 Westy many years ago.  getting it out
was fairly easy, putting it back on was pretty tough, but you don't have
to do that on the side of the road.,  was surprised at how little it
affected things.

&gt; &gt;&gt; the center heat duct would have to be relocated

it was quite a bunch of years ago so I can't remember what I used for
duct, I think it was flex exhaust pipe
