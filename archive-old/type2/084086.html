Subject: Re: [T2] pit thoughts

I wonder if you built the pit correctly and up to code would it cost 
just as much to buy a lift?

&gt;&lt;&lt; build it into the side of a hillside or other location where it is a level

&gt;such a &quot;pit&quot; but didn't buy the house that would have made it easy...

&gt;
&gt;Second thoughts on a &quot;pit&quot;: If you're working on VW's primarily, drop-
&gt;ping the engine would be at least as difficult as on level ground. You'd
&gt;only have a hole slightly less in width as the inner wheel spacing and
&gt;a transmission-type jack would be required to let it down. Then move
&gt;the bus to get it out of the pit...repair the engine...load it back on
&gt;the jack...drop it into the pit...roll the bus back over the pit...lift
&gt;and install engine...Nah...Not worth the effort to put the pit in. Save
&gt;that money and put it towards an electric lift...
