Y'know, I've driven I-5 and don't find that the average is anywhere near
80.  Truck speed limit is 55 and most trucks are running 60-62 or so.
Autos run 65-75.
I run around 60 so I fit in pretty well.  Yes there is the odd
speedburner who is running 80, but that isn't the flow speed.

My understanding is that this accident took place at night.  One place
that our buses are definitely behind the times is in the area of
taillights.  That's why I really don't like to run at night with the bus
if I can avoid it.  In the daytime it is pretty hard to ignore a bus.
