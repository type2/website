Subject: Re: [T2] Engine Identification?

Hi Phil,

You are right in your assumption that this is not the correct engine for
your bus.
However the EA engine is still a 1700cc (1679cc) engine but it was meant to
be built in a Type 4 Volkswagen during 08/'70&gt;07/'74.
The EA engine was also put in the Volkswagen Porsche 914 during
08/'72&gt;07/'73.

The right engine that should have been in your bus is either a CA CB CD or
CE engine. These were all 1679cc engines meant for the Type 2.
The CA and CB engines were both 49Kw/66Hp engines and used during
08/'71&gt;07/'74.
The CD and CE engines were both 46Kw/62Hp engines and used during
08/'72&gt;07/'74.

My 1972 bus that was produced in april 1972 was fitted with a CA engine for
the Swedish market.

&gt; Hello,
&gt;
&gt; I recently purchased a 1972 van. I believe that the engine is not the
&gt; original 1700.
&gt; After a long search I found the engine number
&gt; stamped diagonally on top of the engine by the bell housing. It starts
with
&gt; the letters &quot;EA&quot;.
&gt;
&gt; Can anyone tell me if this is an original engine for my van?
&gt;
&gt; Thanks, Phil.
&gt;
