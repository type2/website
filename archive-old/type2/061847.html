&gt; Looking at Kennedy Engineerings web page they list the later (EJ 22?)
&gt; 2.2 litre engines as only being suitable for vanagons due to clearance
&gt; problems with the intake system and the fuel tank.  I was looking
&gt; under the bonnet of my friends Subaru Liberty (legacy) the other day
&gt; and could see that the throttle body extends almost past the edge of
&gt; the engine / bell housing mating section.

Guess what!  You are now the list expert on Subaru 2.2 conversions!
Seriously, you have done more research on this than I, so trust your
judgement!

&gt; I then looked in the back of my bus (77 model) and the clearance does
&gt; appear extremely tight, however what I was thinking was modifying the
&gt; throttle body so it feeds downwards into the plenum of the intake
&gt; tract instead of from the back of the plenum.

This sounds feasable, but would probably involve some custom work on
the air intake/throttle body.  If you have the ability or the means it
can be done.

&gt; Are there any other reasons apart form this why the 2.2 doesnt fit?

You should also measure the width of the heads and the overall length
of the engine.  I think that these should be within limits but since
you have you friend's engine to check...  Think he'll let you borrow
his Subaru for a few weeks? :)

&gt; I'm looking for a reasonable power increase as my bus is undergoung
&gt; the Bajaification process and I need more HP and torque to turn the
&gt; larger tyres I will be running.  And after looking at HP stuff for the
&gt; T4 engine the Subaru option starts to look really attractive

If you're serious about off-roading your bus with a Subaru conversion,
then you need to do some serious thinking about keeping dirt out of
the engine bay.  Standard buses do this by forcing cooling air out the
bottom, but your conversion probably won't be doing this.  Unless you
work out some way to keep things reasonably clean you will be cleaning
air filters quite often!
