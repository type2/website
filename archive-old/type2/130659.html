&gt;I need the size of the washer &amp; nut that hold the thermostat onto a

&gt;First, could someone tell me the proper nut for attaching the
&gt;thermostat to the case?

&gt;Second, how do the numbers on the fiche
&gt;correlate to the numbers on the part? I must have misread the Library
&gt;article, or maybe the long weekend addled my brain. Regardless, this is
&gt;one of those &quot;teach a man to fish&quot; kinda things.

The fiche tries to organize the parts by the part number system: main group and sub group.

The fiche is further divided into illustrations with are numbered and items are numbered within each illustration. Those two locating systems are only used to match the depicted item in the illustration to a part number in the list for that illustration.
