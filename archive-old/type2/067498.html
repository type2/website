Subject: Update of 1st Engine Pull

Attention K-Mart shoppers:  Elvis has left the building.
                            The engine has left the bus !

I did it.  It is out.  I am so excited.
Thanks to everyone for their advice, I ended up not having to support
the transmission, as there is alread a support in my style/year bus.
I have to go to work now, or else I would sit and stare in awe at my
accomplishment.   Thanks again.  PETE
