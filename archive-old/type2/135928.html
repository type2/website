&lt;&lt; I don't normally watch MTV, but I do try to record all the car shows I can 
from various channels using TiVo. After watching the last one, I learned that 
they're going to be &quot;pimping&quot; a VW Bus this next episode. The next episode 
will air on Sunday. I only saw it for a split second, but they had the interior 
stripped. Usually they put on some crazy color, and some ridiculous wheels 
that I'd never be caught dead with, but it might be fun to watch anyhow.


So, MTV on Sunday. Check your local listings...

There's a reason it's on MTV and not Speedvision...
Pimp My Ride is to automotive engineering as
Military music is to music... ;-(
