Subject: Oil Temps and Breather Boxes

Not really in combination but two questions. Donning flame suit for first
one... Oil temp guage was reading 230-250 yesterday on the highway cruising
between 65-70 mostly around 70. This is a 78 t4. Head temps hovered around
350. The engine runs great. Timing and dwell are on. If this is too hot
what should I try to do to lower it. I'm running castrol 20W50.
Next question is if anyone is using a breather box with their valve covers
vented? I am still having some trouble keeping my covers from leaking oil
and am going to replace them with new ones an new bails but I wondered
about the pressure there. If I am running a web cam with slightly higher
lift could I have higher pressure here forcing oil out. Anyway I would love
hear more about vented VC's on a t-4.

Thanks,

P.S. Fridge works great once I parked on a real level spot. Didn' tthink I
was on that big of a hill but... I can make ice now!
