Subject: Sticking door locks

1979 Federal FI 2.0L

I've had sticking door locks for sometime now. Started off being hard
to unlock in the winter. Now it's 90+ degrees and the locks feel like
they did in the winter. I've been dreading replacing the spring on the
lock. Looks like a real PITA. Thought I would try something easier first.

-Remove door panel
-Peel back plastic on left side of door
-Roll window up
-Remove the two 5mm allen bolts holding on the door handle.

(Now I see why my lock was hard to turn. It looked like a chunk
of carpet wrapped around the lock cylinder. 26 years of dirt!)

-Spray inside of handle around lock cylinder with carb cleaner.
-Insert key into lock and DON'T REMOVE IT!
-Push lock cylinder out of handle. (note how spring sits before removal
 and dont remove the key)
-Hose everything down with carb cleaner.
-Lube and reinstall lock cylinder into handle.

Don't know if it was the right thing to do, but I used silicone spray
and sprayed the moving parts of the lock mechanism inside the door
until the door lock button moved freely. Installed the cleaned
handle and secured with the 5mm allen bolts.

The lock works like it's brand new!  I can't believe I struggled with
these sticky locks for so long. I'm surprised I haven't broken a key.

So, before you follow the procedures for replacing that small spring,
you may want to try removing the door handle and cleaning it and the
lock cylinder first.
