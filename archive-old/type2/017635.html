This weekend will see the final painting of my '76 Westfalia restoration
project!  I've been following the recommended steps; strip equipment,
sandblast, feather out edges, weld in replacement panels from Das Bulli,
prime with DP-40, use polyester surfacer, wet sand, seal and then
paint.  The only sticking point is that after welding in new inner and
outer skins to the sliding door I have found that it probably isn't
worth saving.  It was pretty warped from earlier damage.  When I cut
through the outer skin to weld in the new panel I hit panels of Bondo
about 1/2&quot; in places.

I'm afraid that Michigan does not seem to have a huge supply of nice
doors sitting around waiting to be put to use.  Does anyone have a
reasonably good shape '76 vintage door (with the seperate lock button
below the handle) that they would part with and a plan for how I can get
it?  I will drive some distance if the price is right.  It seems awfully
big and heavy to ship.

You can see pictures of the restoration so far at:

Thanks for any help
