Volks,

I received the attached message from Tom Forhan, concerning a bus located 
in Madison, Wisconsin.  If anyone is interested, or could get by and 
survey it, please let Tom or I know...

Dear Tom and Michelle,
Many thanks for your email today.  Yes, it's true that the time has come 
for us to divest ourselves on our 1971 VW bus, though I actually promised 
Joanne several months ago we'd do it.  As a mechanic friend said, &quot;It's 
like a member of the family.&quot;  Essentially, it's had only one owner, since 
we bought it with quite low mileage almost 26 years ago!  About 16 years 
ago, I replaced the then (as now) very corroded front axle beam.  I recall 
it as not being an easy job and one I'd rather not repeat.  I can imagine 
it is not easy to find a used axle in good condition, and I wonder even 
whether new ones exist.  So, whoever might be interested in our bus needs 
to know this.  But, let me tell you the good and the bad.  The motor is 
great - it  is a rebuilt, including a new case, and probably has about 
6,000 miles on.  It burns NO oil and has as much power as I can ever 
remember the bus having.  It gets about 20 mpg.  The transmission is the 
original and works fine.  Brakes are all very good and tires like new. 
 Battery is new.  I have converted the inside into a camper with 
formica-covered cabinet with sink, icebox, and propane stove. There is a 
fold-down table and the back seat folds down to make a full length double 
bed.  The electrical system is fine except at the moment the back-up lights 
are not working - all other components are working including the radio. 
 Now the bad.  Rust.  I've had professional work done and patched it with 
fiberglass here and there, but not recently (I almost never have driven the 
bus in winter for the last 3-4 years to preserve it's body).  The 
deteriorated front axle beam does cause the bus to steer to one side when 
braking but the steering column and gear box seem to be in good shape. 
 Unfortunately, the rust has involved the frame as well as the body itself 
so structural work may need to be done to fix it up properly.  Since I 
drive the bus so seldom, it is quite clear  that we really don't need a 
second car.  Our main goal now is that our VW bus find a good home since we 
really would be sad to think of it in some junk yard, especially if someone 
is interested in it enough to fix it.  The motor is clearly the most 
valuable part of the bus at this time and we would sell it essentially for 
the price that such a motor would bring.
Tom, I thank you very much for your interest in helping us to find a new 
home for our beloved but antiquated VW bus.  It has taken us on more than 
200,000 miles of adventure in Europe and the U.S.  I look foward to your 
advice.  Let me also take this opportunity to thank you for introducing 
Kathy and Scott to their VW bus which has been a great car for them.
Sincerely, Don
