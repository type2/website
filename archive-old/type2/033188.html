Subject: thanks/ question

Thanks to everybody that helped with my turn signal and starting problems, it 
was great advice.  I have a question for everybody on this list, I'm just 
curious.  I myself have been pulled over by the police 3 times in the last 6 
months I have been driving my bus.  I haven't gotten any tickets though.  I 
was just wondering if other people have this problem too, and I was curious 
as to what states it is the worst in.  I live in central Illinois where the 
cops have nothing better to do, so maybe thats why.  I always get stupid 
excuses too when I get pulled over such as, &quot;umm...I couldn't see your 
license plate..&quot;  Just curious..
