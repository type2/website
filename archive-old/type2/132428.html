Subject: RE: [T2] OOOPS  Alternator fried?  

Ray,

Was the engine running? If not, I'd say there is a very good chance it's OK.

By &quot;alternator strap&quot; do you mean the bracket?

&gt; Unfortunately, by ratchet fell and grounded out
&gt; that big post on the alternator to the point of
&gt; being red hot and smoking.  Obviously, the big
&gt; wire from the battery needs to be replaced.  It
&gt; is toast.  Also the alternator strap was
&gt; completely burnt in two.
&gt;
&gt; Any chance the alternator survived or should I
&gt; just stop what I'm doing and get a new one?
