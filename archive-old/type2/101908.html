Subject: Re: [T2] alt/regulator troubles

Hi. I have some ideas, but I'm not positive.  A dead battery after
reconnecting a loose spade connector suggests that you plugged something
into the wrong place, i.e., something which should run only when the car was
running was drawing current all the time.  Also maybe your new heater is
drawing current all the time as well.
    As for the fast blinking turn signal, that usually indicates that one of
the two turn signal bulbs is burned out. Hope this helps.
