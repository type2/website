Hi List,
  I am moving this weekend and HAVE TO sell my bus.
Its a 73 sunroof transporter....it was at everybus for
those who were there. Orange/white. I am aasking
anyone to come and get it ASAP. I'm asking $1200 OBO.
  It probably needs a new head ....has stuck exhaust
valve on #2. interior is &quot;like new&quot;. This vehicle is a
steal for 1200 and you wont find a better deal out
there. PLEASE come and save this beauty from a long
storage. I live near Hillsborough, NC.
phone#(919)245-0539. 
  Safe travels.......Jeff.
