Subject: Nose Panel 72

Asking for some assistance here. If someone has the interior nose panel for 
a 72 Bus, I would like to arrange for you to overlay it with paper just 
scotch tapped together and mark out the perimeter and all the holes for a 
pattern. Fold it up and send it to me in an envelope. I want to cut a 
replacement from some nice wood veneered ply and need a factory stock 
pattern. Happy to trade for parts new/used as you might have need for or 
send MO for value.

Also, can anyone verify the part no. on the VW fische for a 72 nose 
interior panel and if it is the same as which other years??? Changes every 
year or 2 would not surprise me.

Thanks,
