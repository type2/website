&gt; Well, hate to disagree with Thom but I am near 100% sure as well
&gt; it was sealing wax red and chestnut brown.  To back me up on this
&gt; if one consults the paint chip page on the KG web page you will see
&gt; the manual lists the car types each color is used with, black is
&gt; only used on T1's though L53 Sealing Wax red and L73 Chesnut Brown
&gt; are listed for a slew of T2's, other T2 colors include the familiar
&gt; Dove Blue and quite a few shades of gray.  As I have mentioned before
&gt; this page is a real treasure trove of info, but loading the pages is
&gt; terribly slow as they are understandably scanned images of the origional
&gt; manual.  Plus the benefit of the pages may be somewhat dubious as to
&gt; whether or not anyone can mix with whatever were VW standard pigments
&gt; from the 50's.  FWIW Chesnut Brown is rather dark.

As of 7 years ago, our local Ditzler paint dealer still had all the old 
mixing codes for VWs (he's been in business at least 25 years). The 
matches were extremely close, when compared to patches of the rig that 
weren't faded (ie inside trunk on beetle).

Also, as of the mid 70s, VW still carried their official paints at the 
parts counters, although they were expensive.
