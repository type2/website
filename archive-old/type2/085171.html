Subject: RE: [T2] Bumper color

The '71 bus I currently have is white, and appears to originally have
been white, and the bumpers are white also, which too appears to be
their original color. But who knows if they were replaced in its
lifetime.

Subject: [T2] Bumper color



My van has come a long way in the last couple of months after sitting
for 4 years with a dead battery and slidged gas tank and it's time to
figure out who I want to paint the exterior here in town.

I'm going to paint it Pastell White; thanks to everyone for all the L90D
paint information they've sent.

Does anyone know what is the original color for the front and rear
bumpers? To me it appears VW made a universal white bumper to put on
several different colored campers.
