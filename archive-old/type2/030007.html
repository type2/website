Adam,

Amazingly, I have *exactly* this settup running happily in my '73.  The
block is an '80, not '81, but that is it.  The concerns on this flop are:

First, the vanagon block uses larger bolts than the bay to
mount the bearer bar to the case (M12 vs. M10) 

Second, the vanagon has a different dipstick arrangement.  You can plug
the hole in the case, or you can run both dipsticks (I have both... and
will install a dipstick oil temp sender in one, RSN (real soon now :-))

Third, the obvious tin, fan shroud, and alternator differences.

It is a *very* do-able swap.  Of course, it helps to have John Anderson on
hand to help (push) you thru the rough spots :-)
