Subject: Re: [T2] Is the end near? Few VW buses seen at premier hippie
  gathering!

I've got a nephew operating just like that. He thinks we're cool b/c we've got a VW Cabrio daily driver, a VW Westy and Beetle. he thinks it is all about the hippy &quot;accesories&quot; - that is the wardrobe and the music. Knows little or nothing of the history behind the hippy thing. We're no hippies at my house. I might share a few ideas with them but with all the positive ideas/styles there are alot of negative ones as well. I choose not to operate along those negative ones. 

All in all we have fun breaking the stereotypes. Our politics don't fit, our clothes aren't &quot;right&quot;, wrong music, nice house in the suburbs, no illegal habits, etc.&lt;grin!&gt; 

We like to think of ourselves as laid back folks who just happen to drive VW's. Not hippy VWs but instead just vintage European - or something.
