Subject: Re: Juddering Clutch

I have this problem, and at one point got annoyed enough with
it that I replaced the clutch plate and (while I was at it)
throw-out bearing.  This seemed to fix things for a while, but
then the juddering (great word!) came back.  Recently I rebuilt
the engine, and in the process decided to go wild on replacements,
and replaced the pressure plate and pilot bearing.  I no longer
recall if I replaced the clutch plate or throw out bearing.  At
any rate, it came back AGAIN, and I finally decided it must be
my personal clutch style, which is a bit (I'm guessing) overly
light.  If I work at being more agressive and letting the clutch
down at higher rpms, I don't get the juddering.

Interesting, huh?
