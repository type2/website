Subject: Re: More on heaters, suggestion.

Since the heater thread is starting up again (yup, I feel winter
a-comin' too) I thought I'd advance the ludicrous idea I had for
converting the heat system on my Westy:

1. Cut holes for air intake near front seats, cover with clamshell vent
covers

2. Run hose back along underside of bus (next to heat return hose) from
said holes to heat exchangers

3. Attach to intake of heat exchangers

4. Install marine blower in heat tube at front of bus

5. Built ply and plexi partition to fit over seat backs

The idea is to build a recirculating system that isolates the cab from
the rest of the bus - if we had to sleep in it, we'd use our usual
little electric heater. Whaddya think? I think the problems are:

1. Recirculating air will get chilled on its way to the back of the bus

2. How to run the hoses up into the engine compartment and then back
down to the exchangers - maybe try to lose a little of the end of the
exchanger and run the whole thing below the engine...

Feedback? Comments? Insults?
