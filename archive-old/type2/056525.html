Subject: RE: hot start relay didn't work - now what?

Hi John and the list.

You wrote:

&lt;I have a 1981 Westfalia I acquired recently, and it has a serious hot start
&lt;problem.  Symptoms are typical - one or two stops, maybe three, it starts
&lt;OK but by the third one it might take a while to light properly.  By the
&lt;third stop or later it is very difficult to start, or won't start at all.
&lt;Once, after some serious highway driving, and a couple of minutes of trying
&lt;to start, it would not even turn over (at all, not even a click from the
&lt;starter solenoid) even though I have dual batteries and a quick check of
&lt;lights etc showed I have plenty of juice.

&lt;I know it is heat related, because if I open the rear hatch and remove the
&lt;engine cover for a few minutes, it clears up and I can start fine.  The lack
&lt;of juice to the starter when the lights etc work great indicates it is not
&lt;a vapor lock or something like that.


 I´d pull the starter out and put it on a clean table.
 Start with the solenoid and carefully open it, clean it up inside and
grease the moving parts.
Also clean the contact surfaces with some fine sanding paper.Then do the
same with the starter motor itself. Remember to check the coal brushes or
simply put new ones in while you are there.
This normally helps !
