Subject: '75 spare
Message-ID: &lt;Pine.SUN.3.96.990713154655.9827A-100000_at_grex.cyberspace_dot_org&gt;

&gt; As I mentioned earlier, I didn't really want all the Westy interior, but 
&gt; seeing how neat all the stuff is, I'm planning to use it all and have a 
&gt; complete camper bus.  I can't figure out where they kept the spare tire on 
&gt; the '75.  There was no front tire mount and it looks like the tire would not 
&gt; fit in the rear closet.  Anyone with a '75 Westy care to comment?

--&gt;  Mine has a front tire mount installed, but according to the manual
the stock setup had a tiny, scary-looking spare that was kept deflated in
the under-sink cabinet.  A 12V air compressor was provided to fill it.
