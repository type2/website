Finally found a book that tells about VW ...

    &quot;Small Wonder&quot; by Walter Henry Nelson (published by Robert Bentley)

Originally published in 1965, updated in 1967, 1970 and 1998.

This is a book that actually tells a story, does not just rely on a lot of nice
pictures and lists of facts.

It takes over 100 pages of text just to cover the story of VW and Dr. Porsche
through the end of WWII.  380 pages total.

All of the tables of facts (production figures, car features, ..., etc. are
listed in appendix at the back of the book.

Covers the history, cars and people of VW through 1965.

Good reading!  Highly recommended.
