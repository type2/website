Subject: rough or no idle, poor performance with warm ambient temps

	Howdy volks!,

	Have a 2.0L motor, w/ 1.8L heads, solids lifters, and 100 cam built  
by AVP.  Ever since installed 2 yrs, 5000 miles ago, the motor has  
dismal fuel mileage (12 mpg).  It has new Solex 35 carbs, rejetted by  
AJ Simms, 009 distributor w/ compufire, new wires and plugs.  No  
change in fuel mileage even from old DFEV weber that my original  
motor had.  Now that the air is warming up, I have noticed that  
engine will not idle, and when accelerating, it is sluggish, low on  
power.  When the ambient temp is below 60F, motor idles, and  
acceleration is acceptable.  I have rechecked timing and is set at 30  
degrees total advance.  Removed a plug, it  looks  a little rich.   
Did a compression test and all cylinders are between 100 to 105 psi.   
Checked valve clearance and all are within spec.  Compression seems a  
little low for fresh motor w/ 5000 miles.  I am lost, and ready to  
throw in a SVDA dizzy.  But I don't think its the problem.  Have  
found no vacuum leaks either.  The bus runs well when the air is  
cold, but crappy w/ ambient temps above 60-65.  Today it was 80, and  
it ran like crap.  It passed the dipstick test after running on  
highway for 15 minutes at 60mph (had to keep pedal almost floored).   
Any ideas?  Any tips greatly appreciated.
