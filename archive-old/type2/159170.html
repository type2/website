Subject: Brakes locking up on the way to work stinks!

This morning I adjusted the front brakes on my 66 Westy. They are nearly 
new shoes and the pedal had dropped a bit after break in so I went to 
just adjust them a bit. On the way to work after about 30 miles on the 
interstate and some back roads I took a right turn from a stop. When I 
straightened the wheel, the bus started pulling to the left. I got to 
the top of the hill and pulled off the road. Hopping out I notice the 
stench of something burning and notice a large amount of smoke pouring 
out of the front drivers side wheel. I poured some water on the wheel 
and it sizzled, hmmm quite hot. The wheel was now locked up and would 
not move.

After I gave it a few minutes to cool off the wheel could rotate. I 
turned it to where i could get to the adjusters and loosened them up a 
bit. Everything seemed fine after that and I proceeded to work. Does it 
appear I just had the shoes too tight to begin with?
