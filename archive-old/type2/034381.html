Subject: Backfire question.

Quick question ... I want to get expert opinions.

I have a recently rebuilt engine that suddenly has backfire problems.  It
has about 15K since the rebuild (on the rough roads of the Alcan
Highway), and hasn't given problems until recently.

I have a single carb on my type IV, and while I had the filter removed
last night, I revved the engine a little, to see how it was doing.  I
thought that the filter might be too dirty and impeding airflow.  All of a
sudden, some gasoline ignited in the carberator, and there was a small
explosion in the carberator.  It was the same backfire that I get
sometimes while driving, only this time my head was right next to it and
the carberator cap was off.  Needless to say, it scared me.

So, I want to ask if my list of *possible problems* sounds good, and what
you experts think:
 - tight valve (possible - though I just adjusted them a week ago)
 - blown valve (very doubtful, but I haven't check compression yet)
 - timing issue (what should the type IV engine be timed to? I've timed it
to 5 BTDC .. is that wrong?)
 - bad spark plug (should last 24K, right?  And I removed them in
Lethbridge, Alberta, and cleaned them up)
 - carberator fuel mixture (??)
 - worn points and/or condenser (14K old)

I'll try and check compression tonight, but I have a feeling that is not
it (I hope!).  I could easily readjust the valves, and make *sure* they
are not tight.  The timing can also easily be adjusted ... and I could buy
some new spark plugs, and certainly new points and/or condenser.

Any thoughts would be appreciated.  I have to take her to Maine soon (I'm
in Illinois), and while I am fairly certain she would make it with no
problems, I don't want to cause one on the way.

Thanks guys, and happy new years!
