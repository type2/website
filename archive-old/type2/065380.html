Subject: Re: Help Needed with Gas Heater Installation(s)

Hey Now

I called today.  The tech was wondering why he was getting a couple
of calls a day about this all of a sudden...

I told him about the type2 list, and he said that my BA6 was a special
contraption made for Westfalia and never imported (except in a Westy
of course) to North America.  When I can get more of the info off my
tag (there were a few iterations of the BA6), he can check his archives.

In the meantime, he told me that there is a Westfalia club in Florida
and one in Colorado that do alot with restoring Eberspachers.  He didn't
know more about them, though - anybody know what this guy was thinking
about?

BTW, the new heaters he suggested I use instead is the low-power and
low-fuel consumption B1LC Compact (6000 BTU).  Only about $1300!  Maybe
a propane heater is more in order than ever...

In the meantime...

If ANYBODY out there has a manual for a BA6 - I'd be most grateful!
I have a donor BA6 and a bus that &quot;used to&quot; have one before the PO ripped
it out and threw it away.  To his credit, though - he left everything
else intact; wrapped the wires and terminals in electrical tape, plugged
the gas line, etc.  I took the cover off the belly of the bus, and 
lined everthing up - there are a few things that I couldn't figure out
where they hook up to, so I need help!

        Thanks all

                Jay

Also, if anybody's in NJ and wants an expensive new Eberspacher, you can
contact Jack Miller at Edison Truck Repair in NJ 908 985 0331.

&gt; &gt;Does anyone out there have copies of the owner's manuals, technical
&gt; &gt;manuals, and/or installation intructions for either of these units?
&gt; 
&gt; For a free manual covering the later model BN4 (has a metering inline fuel
&gt; pump and plastic cover over the electricals) call Espar (Eberspacher's
&gt; operating name North America) and ask for a manual--they send them out
&gt; gratis.   You'll get 3 manuals: technical, installation, parts.  Their
&gt; number is: 1-800-387-4800 (calling from the U.S.).  If you're calling from
&gt; Canada it's 1-800-668-5676).
&gt; 
&gt; They no longer sell parts for the BN4 heater, nor do they have manuals for
&gt; the BA6 (and probably not the BN2 either--not 100% sure about that one though).
&gt; 
&gt; Good luck,
&gt;
