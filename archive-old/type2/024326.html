Ok I replaced my heater boxes with J-Tubes, runs a lot quiter but one side has a small exhaust leak, is there a special clamp I can use where it meets  the muffler? If so please let me know where I can find it. Thanks. Also am I harming the heads by not having heater boxes under them that the tin surrounds so that the air can blow through? Seems to me that more air can get to them with the j-tubes in.
 Second, I'm wondering if I should have done an overhaul while I had the engine out. I have some black smoke mainly blowing out the left side when I punch it. Not a lot but enough for concern. Libba had a rebuild about 40,000 miles ago and I religiously changed the oil and adjusted the valves and kept her tuned up, she did sit for 4 yrs.Any suggestions? She is seeing the pro-doctor next week for a looksy before I take her on a 500 mile road trip.
Thanks for any responses, and since I'm new to this group I would like to say I'm glad it's here and that we can help each other out!
