There are many things that can be done to make the automatics work
excellent. There is a place here in Lake Havasu that modifies stock auto's
for OFF ROAD use and they are bulletproof. They make new input shafts, r/p
carriers, modify the valve bodies and also build higher stall torque
converters (this puts the power on when needed).

&gt; I was wondering what the opinions were of the bay-window automatic

been driving a 78 auto tranny for 8 years or so now.
they are not as strong as a manual, but more than strong enough to get the
job done, unless you regularly pull stumps.

there are two basic models, the early ones 73-75 were vacuum shift models
the later ones 76-79 were govenor shift models. the final drive was the
same on both.

the early ones are much harder to find parts for and adjust. the later
ones were internally almost identical to the Golf/Rabbit auto tranny so
the parts are still relatively avaliable 

&gt; up. Any particular goods or bads about it. Any reason...other than 
&gt; preference...that you would drive with a manual tranny instead of 
&gt; automatic?

I have had manuals but can no longer drive a manual and bought an
automatic by default...I live in a large city and have found the auto to
be fantastic for city driving...there are other advantages to. it is next
to impossible to over rev or lug the engine, the tranny shifts for you.

however the downside is the performance is no longer as &quot;stellar&quot; as the
manual tranny, acceleration is slightly slower (got my 0-60 down to 3
days, 14hours 12 minutes, 14seconds)
and fuel economy is off by about .5mpg or so

&gt; What are the different bay-window trannies? Which years are 
&gt; innerchangable? What is the best year(s) for the bay trans? I'm 
&gt; assumming the later ones are the best....

76 or later for sure.  BTW you can put an late tranny in an early auto
bus. vice versa is a little harder but doable


Hope this helps
Bob
