Tom, I've got a 1968 Adventurewagen.  Right after I got it, I took the top off
to clean under it, reseal with 3M 5200, and replace the fasteners with
stainless steel ones.  It looked like Adventurewagen cut out the roof opening
without taking out any structural members in the roof, although they did leave
a rough metal edge (which was covered by interior joinery) and used a duct tape
like material to tape the edge of the roof liner.

We took a spin around the block while we had the roof off, the open roof was
really neat, and I don't think the bus suffered any structurally.  In any
event, I can imagine that the relatively thin A-wagen top does too much to
reinforce the bus.

My vote would be to keep the top, I think you would miss the covered standing
headroom, and I've got decent gas mileage (23 mph) in mine with a 1600 DP.
