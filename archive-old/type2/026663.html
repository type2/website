	That might happen, in say 50 years.  I'm still using my original
one, which
	I assume was installed in the bus in 1973.  Bus spent most of it's
life in
	California, near the beach.

	That's really what I was hoping to hear David, to set my mind at
ease about the relays.

	Slight difference here - the relay does not open and close millions
of
	times per year.
	And higher voltage going through the ignition points too.

	The solenoid is sealed, isn't it?  I don't think it's possible to
clean it,
	except for the external contacts.

	Some relays like the headlight relays and some isolator relays I've
seen can be opened fairly easily.  I've also polished up the contacts in my
voltage regulator.  

	&gt;Anyway, this vendor sells &quot;smart relays&quot; which will not connect the
primary
	&gt;crank battery to the aux one if the crank battery voltage is below
a certain
	&gt;point, say 13 volts.  This prevents the aux battery from sucking
the juice
	&gt;out of the crank battery.

	A neat trick, but not really necessary IMO.  I think I explained my
	reasoning in a previous post.

	I must have joined the list after the post, I'll check the archives.
Based on yours and others comments, I have tentatively decided to replace my
isolator with this &quot;smart relay&quot; device.  The main thing is that I want the
full voltage from the alternator to fully charge the batteries and give me
nice bright headlights and I can't figure out how to boost the alternator
voltage (to compensate for isolator voltage drop) like I did on the stock
regulator/generator.  I had many happy years using the isolator with this
set up.

	I'm going to connect the smart relay between the alternator and the
aux battery to ensure that the cranking battery always stays fully charged.
The aux battery won't get any juice until the primary battery is charged to
cranking capability.  IMO it seems that a regular relay setup will allow the
charges to equalize between the batteries (even with a delay setting or
disconnect relay to allow the cranking battery to get you started).  This
shouldn't be a problem if you drive for awhile before having to crank the
starter again-both batteries will have time to recharge.  But if you drained
the aux overnight, then had to start and stop right away, you may not have
enough juice in the primary to start a still cold engine a second or third
time.  Has this happened to anyone?  It's also not good for the primary
battery to cycle that way.

	I'm planning to connect the crank battery to the ignition switch
circuit (ignition coil, brake lights, horn, wipers, defogger) and the aux to
everything else (interior and exterior lights, power outlets, pump, etc).
In case I drain the aux battery, and need to drive with headlights-very
likely-I am installing a pair of 50amp switches (protected by 50amp circuit
breakers) on the dash to allow me to switch from aux to primary battery
power to feed the fuse box.  (I have to be careful not to turn both switches
on at the same time or the equalizing amperage will surge through the
switches.)  I'm also thinking about rigging an idiot chime to alert me if I
leave the headlights on with the ignition off.  (I occasionally leave my
lights on and the aux battery goes dead.  It's very gratifying to be able to
start her right up!  Thanks to the isolator, the headlights work right
away.)  In case I have a low crank battery and a fully charged aux, I'm
thinking about a short jumper cable and battery switch to connect the two
positive terminals directly.  A volt meter on the dash will show the charge
for each battery.  OK David, or anyone, please tell me what you think of
this set up.

	&gt;and low voltage switches that will automatically disconnect
specific loads,
	&gt;like headlights, if the voltage drops to far.

	That's nice... you're driving along at night with a dead alternator
trying
	to make it one more mile to your home, and all of a sudden at 50 mph
your
	lights go off!  But hey, it's better to protect the battery than to
protect
	the passengers!

	No problem-just rig a simple on/off switch to override the low
voltage disconnect by feeding power to the headlights, or whatever, around
it.  But I doubt this would be needed very often.  Once, on a drive down
Baja to Cabo San Lucas, it was around midnight and my brother was driving
while I napped.  The generator failed and he hadn't noticed the charging
warning light come on earlier and now the headlights were starting to get
verrrrry dim.  We had to get to Cabo right away and we didn't want to get
stranded in the middle of nowhere, so we didn't risk stopping-we knew we
didn't have the juice to start her again.  We turned off the headlights and
everything else electrical and drove fairly slow, hoping to stretch out the
battery.  We used a flashlight to see ahead and coasted downhill.  Talk
about dangerous! Out there the cattle, burros, and horses like to stand in
the middle of the road.  Lots of people have died coming around a curve and
encountering them.  Hitting a big steer at 60 mph is like hitting a brick
wall.  If you swerve to avoid it, you hit an even bigger boulder or go over
a cliff.   After a while, the battery charge got so low, when we used the
brakes, the electrical draw from the brake lights made the engine stumble!
But we made it.

	&gt;Finally, they have an a
	&gt;device which sounds an alarm when the voltage drops to low.

	That would be great to wake up to in the middle of the night.

	Again, a simple override switch could be used, but I was thinking of
using it for things like the TV or stereo.  Besides draining the battery,
these devices can be damaged if allowed to run when the voltage drops too
low.  I'm on a search and rescue team and some of the other members, envious
of my luxurious accommodations compared to their sleeping on Suburban bench
seats (and those are the lucky ones), occasionally like to climb up on all
four corners of my Westy in the middle of the night jumping up and down like
heck, screaming EARTHQUAKE! or AVALANCHE!! (depending on where we are).  A
buzzer I could live with!

	Thanks for the info Alan, sorry I'm being so sarcastic.  :)  I just
feel I
	need to stand up for the relays since they are being unfairly
slandered.

	No worries mate.  I think all our ideas and info are important so
that we can figure out the best solutions.  I've seen some pretty crazy
ideas and absolutely false information on this and other lists.  If you
don't say anything, someone might take it as gospel.
