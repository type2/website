I'm not  from the South, but... I have been caught speeding a couple of 
times.  
Usually I can get away with a lesser charge. Most officers do! So I am  
surprised. 

As for court, my court experience is simple. 1) Admit you  are wrong and the 
judge will probably sigh in relief. Can you imagine how much  BS comes across 
their ears. 

2) Apologize for doing wrong. (again, it's  not something they hear often)

3) Then, after that offer a reason, not  an excuse, a reason. In my bus, I 
have a tiny motor, and I need to get up to  speed long before the merge lane to 
be able to merge safely. This may also be  the case with Nyssa. New cars can 
go from 55 to 65 or 75 pretty quick, but our  old busses need time. When you're 
merging onto a highway, the safest place to  get up to speed is BEFORE you 
merge. 

Anyway, honesty goes a long way  when a judge has heard all the excuses. 

Good  luck!

hey guys  I am from the south    In courts  if you  defend yourself you have 
a fool for a lawyer and a fool for a client  LOL   it does pay to argue 
sometimes.  Mike was she caught on  radar?? If so then it is tougher.  I got off 
once showing the hill I  was going up and a picture of my bug saying that there 
was no way it could run  that fast up that hill( I didn't say anything about 
the big bore motor  :))    Try Adams advice saying it was a safety issue.   
later  Mark D
