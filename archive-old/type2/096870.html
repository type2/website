Subject: gapacological findings

until this moment i thought it was okay to pop bosch plugs into the heads
without checking the gap - trusting they were properly set at the factory.
twiddling my thumbs on this sunday afternoon i decided to clean up the
young plugs and screw them in my new rebuild. being so incredibly bored and
the feelers nearby, i checked the gap and behold none of them were bentley
correct at .024 - in fact some were nearly .030

is it worth it to bonk them on a flat surface and bring them up to spec, or
is the slight increase a-okay?  - steve
