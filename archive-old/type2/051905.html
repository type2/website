Subject: Re: [T2] Portland, OR VW shops?  How do they rate?

I can't speak to the repair shop issue, but I have some insight on the tires
from Les Schwab...

I've been running Jupiter tires from Les Schwab for ~10 years now  -  185R14
Reinforced [6-ply rating]  -  on our 1970 Westfalia Campmobile.  They exceed
the VW specs for load carrying and inflation pressure, handle fine in the
rain and snow, and wear well.  I typically get 80,000 or more miles per
pair.  When I first bought a pair of these tires the price was $50.00 each,
but I believe they now sell for close to $60.00 each.  Including balancing
and taxes, $270.00 would be a good price for a set of four.

They now have these in an 8-ply rating, and I expect that's what you have
been offered/quoted.  If they've quoted $270.00 for 4 of the 8-ply rated
Jupiters, balancing and taxes included, that's a pretty good deal.  I can't
recall whether Oregon has a sales tax on tires, but there may be Federal tax
and a &quot;recycling&quot; charge.

My 6-ply Jupiters are a tad harsh in the ride department when I'm driving
alone in our poptop Westy, but with a load aboard they ride and handle just
fine.  I run 42psi in back and 32psi in front, per Westfalia and VW specs.
I intend to buy another pair of Jupiters by Summer, and will probably go to
the 8-ply rated tires, but I'd be interested in real-world performance
information before I make the purchase.

FWIW.....

&gt;&gt;  Tack on 4 new tires (quoted $270 from Les Schwab for the &quot;heavy-duty
ones required for the heavier campers&quot; - is this true?), and I am in
business.  &lt;&lt;
