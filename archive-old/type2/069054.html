&gt; 
&gt; Hi All,
&gt;   The last couple of days I noticed a slight thumping (occasionally)
while
&gt; driving around 40-45 mph.. Tonight while leaving work I noticed a wet 
spot
&gt; on the outside of the rear tire. it was oil... and as I drove home it the
&gt; thumping noise occurred at greater intervals....
&gt; 
&gt; I looked at the Bentley Manual and I see there is a rear oil seal.. what
&gt; can I do to determine what to replace (besides the oil seal) and what if
&gt; any damage may I have done?
&gt; 
&gt; TIA
&gt;

In my experience, the Type II transaxle/reduction box assemblies are nearly
indestructable.
I drove my '58 camper home from the Sierra's with a nearly dry transaxle
(clunking terribly intermittently). Filled it with 90wt when I got home and
forgot about it. Never had any trouble.
Suggest you try this first. Replace the axle seal and brake shoes (both
sides). Examine the outboard bearing while you are in there. If it looks
ok, refill the reduction box, adjust the brakes and drive it. If the
thumping persists, look to the bearings in the reduction box first. They
are the first to be affected when the boxes lose oil. As I think about this
more, since you heard the noise before there was any leakage, a failing
bearing may have caused the seal to fail.
Good luck, and keep it running.
