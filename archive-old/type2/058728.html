Subject: &quot;Lapping-in&quot; valves...

I took my old '67 delivery van bus to the Philippines when I was assigned there to the
Subic Bay Navy Base as a Marine officer.  The local VW mechanic in town was not
particularly tool-heavy.  He had the two-ended screwdriver and the pliars from a Bug
tire-change kit.  The guy did a valve job by pulling the engine, stripping the heads, and
then sitting there patiently for hours with some grinding compound and a small suction cup
on the end of a pencil stuck to the top of the valve, rotating the pencil between the
palms of his hands.  He had been working on VW's for 20 years, and no tools not
withstanding, kept my bus running well for two and a half years.  Before I left, I gave
him a nice wooden mechanic's  creeper I ordered from J.C. Whitney, because all he had to
slide under cars was a piece of cardboard.  He gave it to his son to use as a scooter!
