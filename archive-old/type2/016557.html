            And when they use alcohol to lower the octane? I'm not sure
I'd agree that lead (or any other octane-booster) slows down the burning
rate, my understanding is that they increase the flame point, making it
harder to fire off the load. Don't know whether that translates into
slower burning or not.
       I suppose you could tune the low compression engine to better
utilize high octane fuels --- just by seriously advancing the spark, but
I'd bet you'd run into starting problems before you got enough benefit to
justify the extra cost of the fuel. And I'm sure there are other things,
like a special cam, that might help. You also might consider getting a
pair of the VW heads that they use in VW-powered aircraft that have 2
plugs per cylinder, eh? And then one of the neat electronic distributors
that fire those plugs at different times, to really increase the burn
time.
      But hey,  if you are going to mess around like that, why they heck
don't you just raise the compression and really get the benefit of
high-octane fuel? I mean, what's the point? If I were going to spend the
extra money for high-octane on a regular basis, I'd sure mill those heads.
