Hiya Andy,
This is mostly from recollection, but................ In their original 
configuration engines in the &quot;B&quot; series were single port 1600cc.  Single 
relief case.  I recall the stock carburetor was the 30PICT2 and engine put 
out in the neighborhood of 57 hp SAE.  I believe it was introduced during the 
68 model year.  Standard equipment in 69 and 70 (with an upgraded carb - 30 
PICT3).
Your serial number following the &quot;B&quot; should have six digits starting with a 5.

Hope this is of some assistance.

Mike
