&lt;&lt; My questions about weld thru primer:
 1. Why is it I have never heard of this stuff? Should I get out more?
 2.  If this stuff will keep welds rust free for 20 years, why not use it for
      the entire undercarriage, everywhere rest may attack?
 3. Where do I go to get some? I am planning to make major cosmetic upgrades
     to my bus and rust prevention is a MAJOR consideration.
 Thank you,

    I ran across weld thu primer in about 1994 not sure how long it's been
around.  As for wither you should get out me, hell ya! Let me know and I'll go
with ya!

The problem with using weld thu primer for an undercoating, first off is
cost-$20 for a rattle can of this stuff and second-you still have to seal it.
This primer is zinc rich and is activated by heat...ie..spot welds.  And as
you know 99% of joined panels have sealer around the edges, hence this stuff
is great for reconstruction, but I wouldn't use it for an all around primer.
But due to most joined panels having sealer the old school of thinking is to
screw weld thu primer and just weld away.  My thoughts are sealers can be
broken and moisture can get to the welds.  As for the outside, I'll stick to
Vari-Prime, followed by a primer surfacer, and then primer sealer.
 
Where to score Weld Thu?  Most body shop suppliers carry it.
Peace, Love, and Happy reconstruction,
       Mr. Bubble Head
