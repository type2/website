Subject: Shifting problems

Hello everyone, I am almost afraid to ask this but: does anyone have any
input into what could be making my 1978 bus (manual trans) suddenly not
want to shift into gear?  I am able to shift into first with the engine
off and then with great effort upshift to get out on the highway, but if
I take it out of 4th it is impossible to down shift with out shutting
off and starting over again.  We have not noticed and weird noises or
anything, this just started suddenly last night when we pulled into a
toll booth and could not pull out!  My husband checked and adjusted the
clutch cable today and I took it out for a drive during which it shifted
up fine, a little tough downshifting.  I am driving to work tonight with
it, so wish me well.  I am going to take it to our VW mech tommorow, and
altho I trust him, I just wanted some feedback because- I LOVE MY
BUS,and I want it well!  Beth with the green 78 Bus,
