          Either your choke is not functioning or you have a vacuum leak -- or
both. One very problematic area for vacuum leaks is the brake servo hose.

&gt; So, lucky me, I have an auto parts store around the corner from my house.
&gt; I went and bought new plugs and wires.

     No, unlucky you -- you'll probably never get a VW set of wires anywhere
except VW dealers, RMMW, Bus Depot, etc.


&gt;
&gt; wires. After I replaced the plugs and wires, it didn't have as much power,
&gt; would lose speed badly on hills.

      Sounds like you misplaced the wires, a common thing --- even if you did
it strictly by the book, do you know for sure that the PO didn't have the dizzy
off a gear tooth or two? Start by finding when #1 piston is at TDC on the
comression stroke. See where the rotor points (it should point to the little
notch on the rim of the dizzy, but wont if the dizzy is in a tooth or more
off), but anyway, put #1 wire where it points, then go from there.


&gt;
&gt; off. There were no leaks, but the gaskets were dead. The valves were
&gt; totally tight.  Couldn't get my smallest feeler guage in. Yikes! So I
&gt; adjusted all the valves, and changed the oil.

       Maybe someone put hydraulic lifters in it???? Probably not, but maybe.



&gt; mechanic, who I'm more inclined to trust. (Hi Christopher!) He had me
&gt; timing at 10BTDC. Christopher says he times his with a similar setup at
&gt; 0,TDC.

      No, it should be closer to 10BTDC. At least 7.5BTDC. The 009 dizzy really
does best at 10


&gt;
&gt; Anyway. After I paid him all the money to install it, he told me he had no
&gt; idea what the proper temperature was. &lt;sigh&gt; In frustration, I let it get
&gt; up to 275 one time before I pulled over. Later I found out that the proper
&gt; operating temperature is 125-158...

            275 isn't extremely hot, and you're never going to see 125-158,
more likely 200-225 or 250 normal running.



&gt;
&gt; I'd noticed that there seemed to be a vacuum leak, it would do that
&gt; 'revving up, revving down' sort of thing. I noticed that the sleeves that
&gt; seal the intake manifold to the intake pipes looked a little worn and
&gt; crackly. Yuck. I put it off for a while, not yet feeling adventurous
&gt; enough to take it all apart. Eventually, I noticed that the symptom went
&gt; away... Weird.
&gt;

      Vacuum leaks can be intermittent, but you need to get after that --
they'll burn up your valves quite quickly.
     Nowhere do you mention doing a compression test -- after the overheating
and vacuum leaks, etc, you really need to do one --
     One bit of advice -- quit replacing parts, find out what the actual
problem is before replacing anything. Diagnosis by parts replacement is not
only expensive, but can cause enormous problems all by itself -- if the new
part isn't installed right or perhaps is defective, you've just added a whole
new problem to the mix, making diagnosis even more difficult.
