	In welding, the work gets melted.  Some foreign material is 
usually added, to form a new alloy which is the joint, but melting 
the work is inherent in welding.
	Soldering doesn't melt the work but merely wets it with a 
molten metal of lower melting point.   If you test a soldered joint 
to destruction, the solder will bust or detach from the work before 
the work breaks (unless the work is foil-thin).
	Brazing is much more like soldering  -  the work itself is 
not melted (tho' it has to get plenty hot for the added molten 
brazing-rod to wet it).  Lumiweld is a form of brazing, for aluminum. 
Even a first go at Lumiweld will probably give you a joint that is 
stronger than, say, 1/4&quot; Al sheet.  Brazing can be fully strong 
enough for many purposes.  You can do a good range of brazing with 
just an LPG torch; and you probably already have the LPG for a 
barbeque.

	This is the most superficial glimpse of a large realm which 
occupies some experts full-time.  Indeed it can be wiser to turn to 
such an expert rather than try to become a 'bush welder' (term coined 
on model of 'bush carpenter').  But I must say also that it is 
satisfying to learn the rudiments of brazing &amp; welding, crudely but 
well enough to do simple joins of metal.
