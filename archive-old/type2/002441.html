&gt;Hmmm...perhaps the double relay is supplying power to the fuel pump
constantly. That is, maybe the relay that is &gt;sending power to the fuel pump
isn't opening when I turn the key back from IGNITION to ON. I have to turn
to &gt;OFF to cut the power to that relay. I have a couple spare double relays
I can try.

Yeah, try a spare relay.  Can't hurt.  I think the only thing that might
affect, though, is the fuel pump staying on situation.

&gt;Hey, I did the ignition test with the ignition wires at the starter and the
fuel pump just kept merrily pumping. (Just for clarification: Once I open
the circuit with the IGNITION, it stays open with the key to ON until I turn
the key to OFF. If I turn the key ON, but not to IGNITION, the fuel pump
doesn't go on.)
&gt;
Ok, so what that tells me is that something else besides the ignition is
feeding the double relay power when it shouldn't be.  It seems then that it
is wired semi-correctly at least.  The pump doesn't start until you turn the
key to start but for some reason it stays running when the key goes back to
ON and the engine has stopped.   Not sure what that might be except for poor
wiring, a sticky relay or some kind of weird feedback loop.

Again, If I were you I would verify the wiring according to the wiring
diagram, maybe swap in another double relay or run Bentley's double relay
diagnostic procedure.

It's easier to swap in another relay but if your problem is like Steve's a
different relay won't make any difference :-)
Something to look forward to I suppose.
