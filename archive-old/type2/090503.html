&gt; 
&gt; well I ordered some from Bus Depot and they gave me a time but they did
&gt; come sooner, you also can speed em up with higher priority shipping

I'll consider that, thanks.
 
&gt; &gt; Does anyone have a recommendation for another vendor who might be a bit
&gt; &gt; quicker? 
&gt; 
&gt; last time I did that, used the vendor that was fastest, turned out to be
&gt; the slowest because the quality was so low and had to redo the job.

That's why I'm looking for recommendations. :) I want them to be really
good -- if I'm going to invest the money I want them to last.

&gt; &gt; Another option might be to get my current heads rebuilt -- anyone know
&gt; 
&gt; good to have a spare anyway
&gt; 
&gt; one thought would be to find a junkyard engine with heads, use them while
&gt; haveing your &quot;known&quot; heads rebuilt

Alas, the local boneyards are pretty well picked-over. I'm planning on
taking a trip down to LA next month, and will be visiting the boneyards
there to stock up on goodies, but I'm not going if I don't have a running
bus.
