I found this in a newsgroup. Please don't reply to me.

To anyone interested in Dallas, TX:  every day I pass an old bus that 
has been for sale a while.  

I know little about the transporters, but this booger is really 
old--probably late 50's--and looks fairly straight.  It is located on 
Munger Blvd. and Worth St.  ( I think)

Anyway, it looks like it could use a home.
