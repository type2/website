Well it runs!=20

But:

Missing some of the accelerator linkage. so the peddle is mushy because =
I have it rigged.=20

Smoke coming from the right side of the engine? Smells funny? Unlike =
regular exhaust smell. I dont see any oil leaking :-((

Still kinda loud but the sharp bang bang bang is gone.

Other notes to follow.

BUT IT DRIVES!

I did kind of a victory lap (limping as it was).
