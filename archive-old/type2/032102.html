Subject: Re: [T2] 1700 Cylinder Head Mystery Holes

&gt; the problem discovered was that there are two holes on the head
&gt; leaking combustion pressure. i see short wiffs of flame during firing.
&gt; scared to
&gt; run it anymore.  each hole is just to the outside and below the outermost
&gt; intake manifold bolt.  -

Then Jim wrote:
&gt; Those holes are where the air injection ('smog pump') part of
&gt; the 1700 emissions system plugged in.  Thread the holes if they're not
&gt; already threaded and put bolts in them.

So I wrote: Yes. And be sure to peen them securely so they never come off
again, like mine did. I was running heads like these on my bus for while.
Then one of the bolts worked its way out and fell away. I immediately had
a really loud problem:  sounded like a hole in the muffler or exhaust
manifold. I drove it for a while, attracting attention everywhere I went.
I saw the leak spot by the soot on the head and thought I had a cracked
head. I pulled the engine, found the problem, learned about what Jim wrote
(quoted above), and replaced the heads with 1800 heads 'cause I also had a
tiny crack (unrelated) that looked like a future problem.

You want to be sure that those bolts never come out on their own.

BTW, I think it's true that those 1700 heads are rare relative to the 1800
heads because that exhaust reinjection system was only on about 1 year
worth of buses and the 1800s were used for several years? Can any more
tech savvy comrades out there confirm this?
