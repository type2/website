Subject: Bustoberfest in the Midwest

If there are any bus people in the Iowa, MO, KS, OK, CO, Neb area that are
looking for a great campout this month, come to Bustoberfest.  This year
Bustoberfest will be October 24, 25, 26.  In addition to all the fun we've
had in the past years, this year we are planning a little &quot;trick or treat&quot;
bus style for the camping kids on Saturday.

Our Bustoberfest website hasn't been updated lately because our web master
is in Iraq, but you can see how much fun we've had in the past at:

We would love to see new faces, this is a beautiful park and a wonderful
time of year to camp, but bring some warm clothes, the nights I'm sure will
be cool.
