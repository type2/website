Hi everyone, happy friday!  
A couple of weeks ago I wrote to the list concerning my front axle beam
being so rusty that it &quot;settled&quot; and I need to replace it.  Well, I got
several responses and hints on what to do when removing/installing the new
beam....and I got a terrific offer from BUSted VW on a new used front axle
beam....my problem is..I seem to have lost my email on how to get ahold of
the fine gentelmen and Busted VW!!  I blew it here...kinda embarassing..I
appreciated the offer of the special deal on the front axle beam from my
friend at BUSted VW....but DOH!  I lost the email.  How do I get ahold of
you my friend....I lost your number!!!  Would you email me again so I can
call you....I'm ready to order..I'm up to the task of replacing this beast!!

Thanks a whole lot,

Dustin
