&gt; How can I store
&gt; them, so that they won't dry out or crack? I'd likely be keeping them in
&gt; my garage, or at the very least, a shed.

Keeping them in the dark at all times is the only technique I know. I threw
away a pair of tires that were 20 years old that had been kept in the dark
in the house all that time and showed no signs of cracking. It felt bad to
throw them away but it seemed the right thing to do.

I've noticed RV owners get those hang on covers for their tires to keep the
sun and moss away...
