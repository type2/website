Subject: body panel replacement
Message-ID: &lt;371C842D.360D5E55_at_manvillerubber_dot_com&gt;

As I prepare to do some rusted body panel replacement I have a
question....how long do replacement, welded in place body panels last
before rusting?  It seems to me that the heat of the welding will burn
off any paint or corrosion protection from the back side of the panel
exposing portions of the back side and making the area around the
replacement panel likely to rust quickly.  Is this the case or is there
something I am forgetting to consider?
