Subject: Anyone going through Dallas to BBTA?  Please help

Volks,

I promised a certain listmember who is in the St. Louis area that I would
send him up a pair of '79 heater boxes with a friend that was going to
Busses by the Arch.  The problem is that my friend is not going to make it,
and I can't find anyone else from the Dallas area that is going.

Is there a kind soul that is going through Dallas on the way to BBTA that
could pick up these heater boxes and take them to BBTA?  Both I and the
recipient would be most appreciative.  Please let me know...

-David
