&gt;Then I pointed out the shirt she was wearing. A Peace frog shirt with a
&gt;circle of VW busses!!

Hang in there, Doc, and go proactive.  I guarantee you won't have a hard
time finding one of her friends who thinks the bus is way cool.  Arrange to
take the girls to a movie, but pick up the friend first, then swing by to
get your daughter.  If the friend is all asmile and revved about the
transportation, it will swing the momentum considerably.

It's all in the way you look at it.
