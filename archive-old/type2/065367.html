Subject: Re: valve problems

&gt;Hello to all who are listening,
&gt;Once again I have come upon something troublesome and I
&gt;am greatful to have the collective wisdom of this list
&gt;available. My problem is this. I attempted to adjust my
&gt;valves tonight. I lined up the rotor with the notch in
&gt;the distributer. I also lined up the notch in my pully
&gt;with the seam in my fan housing (This is a T4).
&gt;I then proceeded to loosen my intake and exaust valves
&gt;on the #1 cylinder. The exaust came loose ok but the intake
&gt;side has a problem. I can completely remove the adjuster and the
&gt;valve still sits on the rocker arm. What does this mean?
&gt;Is my head trash? Thanks to all

Try lining up the notch with the 0 degree mark on that protractor-looking
thing that runs along the upper left (fif) arc of the pulley.  This is TDC
on a T4 engine.

good luck,
Eric
Maggie
