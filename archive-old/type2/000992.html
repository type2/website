About 11 months ago I went to Tires Plus and said I needed tires for my '72
westy. &quot;I have just the tire for you&quot; He set me up with these low profile
195s with a load rating of 1120 lbs.  At the time I did not know the
difference --  My speedometer was off and these tire really did not look
right.  When I took the van out of storage this spring one of the tire was
flat, so I put on the spare.  This really highlighted wrong these tires
were.

So here I am 11 months later with these tire I do not feel comfortable
with -- I decide to try to return them.  I spoke Charlie, the manager tires
plus.  To my surprise he apologized, gave my full credit for my tires and
ordered me a set of reinforced Michelin MX 185R14.

While I was disappointed that this happened in the first place, I was quite
pleased at how well they took care of the situation.

The Tires? They ride nice, my speedo works and rated at 1520 lbs.
