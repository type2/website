Subject: Jalousie Weather Strip

There's a grey strip of rubber along the top of the Jalousie windows
on my '77 Westy.

It was discussed some time ago on the vanagon list where to get
replacement rubber for this weather strip. I snooped around in the
archives but couldn't find the article discussing this.

Does anybody know if or where replacement rubber can be found?
