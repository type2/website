Hello folks,

Well I have decided that I will be selling my van. I have too many cars
and hobbies as it is now. The van looks and drives really nice.

It's a 1972 Kombi camper with a rebuilt 2 litre engine, new Weber carb
and a high top roof. A description of it is in a previous post under 
&quot;What's my bus worth ?&quot; Anybody interested or questions send me an email
for pictures to  &lt; gvsmith_at_ricochet_dot_net &gt;.  I'll be asking $4500 obo. 

List gets first chance then I'll put it in the newspaper and AutoTrader
for sale mags.

I live in San Francisco.
