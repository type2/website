&gt; Well, it's running a bit rich, but you have quite a bit of leeway on the 
&gt; NO side so you might want to lean it out a few clicks in the AFM (tighten 
&gt; the spring).  The EGR will also help keep the NO down as you lean it out 
&gt; as leaning the mixture raises NO levels.
&gt;
&gt; Now, I am guessing that the AFM works the same way as on my 78.... I'm 
&gt; sure someone else can confirm.

Same spring-resisted air-vane AFM setup as on the 78.  Since I have no way 
to test the results on this vehicle - Federal's had no O2 sensor and even 
though I added a bung the O2 readings have been unreliable - I'm not sure if 
I want to open up the AFM.  Since I'm only guessing at this point I'll just 
settle for turning out the CO screw.
