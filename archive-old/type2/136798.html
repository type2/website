Subject: Turn Signals and Hazard lights

I have a 1978 Bus. For years when I used the hazard lights, the next time
I used the turn signals, the light would turn on BUT not blink on and off.
I then would turn the hazard know ON and OFF very quickly and the turn
signals would then work. 
Now that trick is not working. How can I fix this? A part?, fuse etc.
Thanks
Mark
