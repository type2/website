&gt; i have driven on 3 cylinders in my triumph; i have not tried it in my
&gt; bus...it may not have enough power with only 3 cyl.  it could also
&gt; unbalance the engine and cause wear, but we are not talking about big
&gt; distances or long times at high speeds here.

I drovew around for quite awhile on three cyliders when I dropped a valve
seat and lived in denial of it for a month.  &quot;It's just not timed right&quot;
and &quot;Thre must be an air leak in the carbs&quot; were my two main
self-delusional statements.

I wouldn't suggest it, but if it's the only way home, go a head but be
careful and watch out for the gas that will come spewing out of the plug
hole.  Now that I think about it, don't do it.  Too much chance for a
fire.  If you can keep the plug in the hole, by undoing the plug wire to
prevent firing, then maybe it will work.
