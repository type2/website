When I bought my 74 it had a Pioneer AM/FM cassette player mounted in the
dash, it fit and looked good.  I pulled it out and stcuk an old Saphire
AM in there and it popped right in and fit perfect, so obviously no mods
to the dash were needed to accomadete the Pioneer.

Anybody want to swap an AM/FM Saphire or and AM/FM/SW out of another car
for a nice Pioneer?

&gt; &gt;Actually, I know that the holes in the doors are aftermarket, but I 
&gt; like
&gt; the idea of going stock. So here is the question....Do the original 
&gt; German
&gt; radios use speakers that I could put in those holes??
&gt; &gt;
&gt; 
&gt; I believe the Type II's only had a single dash speaker mono system. 
&gt; Others
&gt; will correct me if I'm wrong. Later Vanagons would have door 
&gt; speakers that
&gt; might just fit. And some of the deluxe modles will have a system 
&gt; with rear
&gt; speakers. I'm not sure those radios will fit the dash without 
&gt; cutting,
&gt; though. Check with Crutchfield or other Blaupunckt dealer for a new 
&gt; stereo
&gt; system that can, alas, be custom fitted. A stock system and a boom 
&gt; box for
&gt; stereo needs might be cost effective. All you then need do is put 
&gt; the boom
&gt; box and stock radio on the same station, then remove the boombox at 
&gt; will
&gt; and be stock if and when you want.
