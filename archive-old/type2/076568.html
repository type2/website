Subject: Re: [T2] Gas Tank Issues

There is two different filler necks on bus. There are ones for leaded
(bigger) and ones for unleaded have a small restrictor.
Mine needed replacing and the only one available is the leaded gas one. You
just need to push the nozzle in tight so the auto shut off works. If the
filler is no longer availabe you could always try one of those motorcycle
look alikes. Like the cars in the fast and furios had (just kidding , maybe?)
I also at one point had to replace the hose that goes from the fuel filler
pipe to the tank. This hose is no longer available. I tried a section of
radiator hose and that swelled up and was no good. I eventually found a good
used one.
If you try a used one make sure to give it a squeeze and look inside. If you
see any cracks it's no good. If you can't find a good
used one try a marine supply store.They have various sizes of fuel hose for
boats. You might find something that works. The only other things that could
leak would be the rubber hoses going to the vent lines or fuel supply. I
wouldn't think that the gasket around the
sender would leak that much.

&gt; Here in NJ, they get jumpy because its illegal to self serve.

&gt; actually that is caused by having pumps set for the smaller unleaded gas
&gt;  fills , and most buses have the bigger leaded filler.
&gt;  If they put em in a little differently they won't stay on??

&gt; &gt; &gt; I too have this problem, specifically when I fill the tank.  For some
&gt; &gt; &gt; reason, the pumps here in NJ don't register when the tank is full
&gt; &gt; &gt; and I end up having gas spew out of the driver's side bottom.  I
&gt; &gt; &gt; Don't fill the tank past 3/4 and that seems to address the
&gt; &gt; &gt; issue, although there are still fumes.
