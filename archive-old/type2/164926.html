Subject: Friday, not VW related, Bosch F.I., Volvo 164E

Can somebody give me a good suggestion on where to buy parts for our 1975 Volvo 164E, used and new?

Please do not say IPD, they don't carry much for it.

I have been trying to get the correct front brake rotors for nearly a month.

I am also trying to find a good source for injectors, injector parts, injector repair, injector testing.

I was trying to tear off the original crimped on hoses from the injectors, I dropped one and cracked the little plastic &quot;hat&quot; on the end, I reinstalled it but I am afraid that it will not function well.

IPD sells new injectors for $750.00 a set.

The injection system is a Bosch D-Jetronic.

A few days before we bought our car we looked at one from Craigslist, it was pretty far gone as far as being a swamp inside, but it was identical to the one we bought, we went back to where it was parked and it was gone, we looked in a few wrecking yards hoping to find it, we would like a few pieces from it and would gladly buy the whole car for a few hundred bucks, so if you see a 164E in a wrecking yard or know where I could buy one please pass it along.

Also looking for decent front seats, aparently early 240 seats will fit.

Thank you,

James in Portland, Oregon
