Subject: Re: [T2] Is the end near? Few VW buses seen at premier hippie
  gathering!

Oregon Country Fair, eh? I was just down the road on the Oregon Coast
(Florence) that weekend, and there were a few busses on the 101. There
was a nice maroon splitty (waved) and 2 white bays (both waved). In
fact, there was another bus camping at Honeyman SP one of the nights we
were there while the fair was going on. I saw them pulling in, but the
park was too big - I couldn't find them. I guess in answer to your
question, there are plenty of them around Oregon. But, the numbers are
dropping here too.
Take Hal's suggestion, and interpret the V as for Volkwagon. If you
want to have some fun, flash them a &quot;W&quot; (for the other half of the VW).
The fact the Rep's used that to symbolize Mr. Bush in '04 makes it
especially funny, IMHO. The faces switch from &quot;hey man&quot; smiles to &quot;what
the...&quot; questioning looks in a snap of your fingers. Funny stuff.

I meant to trip-report my venture down the coast, but I kinda forgot.
Hapy ran great: $45 in gas for 450 miles, so I got around 24mpg -
astounding, really. He started running a little rough after we got over
the Coast Range, and found by leaning the carb a touch, it made up for
the damp coastal air, and he ran better.
The stretch of 101 between Newport and Florence is very twisty. That
stretch turns white-knuckley when the rains set in, and the big rigs
turn into a grille in your rear-view mirror. This was the first trip
with the new Koni shocks, and I gotta say, it was like floating on air.
Very nice. My wife and I were stunned Hapy could feel so firm on the
road, yet not kidney-punch on the bumps. Even the wind sheer seemed to
be reduced. Overall, I strongly encourage anyone in the PacNW or CA (or
anywhere, for that matter) to check out the Oregon Dunes - 75 miles of
sand dunes from Florence south.

PS. BTW, I'm selling a couple of pairs of Solex on theSamba. If you
know someone that needs them, I'm selling them for what I paid last
year.
