Heat Blower Fan -- 211 959 113C.  Can someone tell me the provenance of
this item?  I don't recall how I came by it, or why I have only one (I
think).  I'm trying to thin out my collection of parts; and I suspect it
may be sought after by somebody -- somebody, that is, who wants to
direct an increased airflow to the passengers in the rear of the bus.
Not me!  I'd rather keep all the heat I can get up front.
