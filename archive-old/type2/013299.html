Dear listfolk,

I've been following all the air conditioner banter and just couldn't hold back
any longer. Forgive me.

VW buses, even Riverias, Adventurewagens, and Sambas or whatever are small things. 
They hard-shell tents, not RVs.

Most VW Bus drivers I know enjoy the outdoors and (gasp) actually expand their cramped 
bus quarters by making the great outdoors their family room.

Generators are incredibly unpopular, noisy, inefficient and smelly things--solar
options making them more so. Yes, I'm even talking about the new top-of-the-line 
Honda$. 

Besides, most campgrounds have rules that prohibit running generators  between 
10 P.M. and 8 A.M.

Ok, you plug it in at the campground. Well, I for one don't want to be within 100 yards 
of you listening to it all friggin' night. I personally prefer hearing the night stillness 
pierced by a hooting owl or love-struck mockingbird. It is also nice to hear things approaching.

May I suggest either camping where evenings cool down and lying still, or getting a small 
fan and opening your screened windows.

Of course you could also sell the VW and buy a 35-foot Bounder RV, or get a hotel for the night.

Air conditioning a little VW bus is about the silliest excess-baggage idea I've seen cross 
this list since I subscribed. There. I said it and I'm glad.
