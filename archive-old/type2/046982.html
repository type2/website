Yep, &amp; pay about 6-8 times as much as a fuel pump for a carbuerated engine.  
Or (list folk) is there backwards compatibility?  I don't know what the 
difference between the two pumps is, myself.

I assume since my 79' westy has a weber carb, that the
feul pump was changed also in the prcess. so will I
have to find a factory feul pump, when I switch back
to F.I.?
