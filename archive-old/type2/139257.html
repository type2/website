Don--

say it ain't so!!!  I welcome your frequent posts, glad you are not shy.
Hope you have your flame suit on because I won't be the only one.  Heading
to the tire store tomorrow?  I am a convert to the stiffer sidewalls, having
recently been rid of my 215/75's and I will repeat the mantra of the dharma:

185R14C.  185R14C.  185R14C.
Load Range D is 8 ply
Load Range D is 8 ply
Load Range D is 8 ply
the &quot;C&quot; suffix means &quot;commercial/reinforced&quot; and is different from the load
range.

now you may be a rebel, and go for the wider 195R14C. or even something like
a 205/75/14.  but keep in mind:

Reinforced Sidewall
Reinforced Sidewall
Reinforced Sidewall

Load Rating &gt;1500 lbs
Load Rating &gt;1500 lbs
Load Rating &gt;1500 lbs.

Budget yourself $65-100 per tire plus mount and balance.  I don't know about
all the budget tires but this is the same size spec'd for the 80's Volvo 240
wagons, due to their requirement for a reinforced sidewall.

The T2 library has a lot of good tire info but available brands seem to be
outdated.

good luck,
Will A. &quot;got 185R14C?&quot;
