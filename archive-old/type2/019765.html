I would check EVERYTHING for leaks, especially in your intake.  Check
all the hoses that run  to all the various places from the  intake 'S'
tube.  Check the line that runs to the aux air regulator and make sure
that the little elbow isn't broken.  If you're vacuum lines are old, put
new ones.  It's cheap and easy to do.  Check that your distributor is
working correctly.  If not, rebuild it, or oil it, or one of the two. 
Make sure you're timing is correct and you get your proper advance.

also check the manifold vacuum hoses (one that goes to the fuel pressure
regulator and decel valve), and the power assist hose for you brake.  If
you want to be hard core, check your injector seals because those could
be leaking.  Might as well replace all your fuel lines while you're at
it.. hehehhe.. granted it's a little time-consuiming :)

check the first few things and see if that helps, if not, move to the
more advanced.  But don't go messing with your AFM until your sure
everything else works..

later,
Mike

&gt; Hi people
&gt; 
&gt; I have been working on my 78 to put it back on the road.
&gt; Its a FI as some of you will remember, I’ve posted a while ago about
&gt; related problems...
&gt; Lately, I fixed a leak near the auxiliary regulator.
&gt; Now the engine will start (high RPM)but unless I push on the gas pedal
&gt; It will dies until it gets warmer. When it gets warmer, the engine will
&gt; go on a funny cycle, almost dying every 20 or so seconds, shaking the
&gt; buss like hell, and it will start again at high RPM and so on.
&gt; The idle screw doesnt affect anything - wide open or all the way down,
&gt; no noticeable difference (to an untrained ear anyway).
&gt; 
&gt; any ideas?  Air Flow Meter?
&gt; 
&gt; thanks!!
