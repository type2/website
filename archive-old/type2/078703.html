Nope - won't even claim a later model can be done that fast.

An early model if you are fast and all if easy to loosen and disconnect.

But not a late model.

Even i don't like pulling the late models.

Lost of maneuvering.

Not complicated, just a good way to invent new words you don't want your 
children to use.

&lt;grin&gt;

Did not know which animal this bus was - newer or older. Very different 
methods.

Bye!

&gt;If in fact you can cleanly pull ( or drop in ths instance ) an engine
&gt;out of a late model bus in 30 minutes or less, stop in some day---this
&gt;might just be interesting.
&gt;
&gt;And by cleanly I mean marking all the electrical and vacuum connections
&gt;so it doesn't take a month to return it to it's original state.
&gt;
&gt;A early bus and a bus with a suitcase engine are two different animals.
