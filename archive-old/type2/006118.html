Hey everyone,

I just aquired a '70 bus free.  Everything is in pretty good shape, all
things considered, but I'm have a fuel pump problem.  I checked all of the
fuel lines, the carb, the fuel pump (gaskets, seal, etc.) and there is no
fuel leakage, but there is gas dripping off the left side of the muffler
body, not from the tip but the body of the muffler.  I thought that perhaps
gas is leaking into the case, but I just changed the oil and a smell at the
dipstick shows no gas in the oil; so ......?  The engine is a 1600 upright
that has been sitting with the bus for about 3 years.  When I got the bus,
the lines to the fuel pump were reversed (fuel line on the bottom pipe, carb
line on the top).  I changed these and initially seemed to get some fuel to
the carb, but now it seems not.  I guess I just need a new fuel pump.  What
do you think?  Is there any way to check the fuel pump to be sure?  It
seemed ok by the Muir method.

A little perplexed,
Brennan Welch
