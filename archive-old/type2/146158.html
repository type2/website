   For the record, my buddy bought an &quot;O'Malley&quot; jig saw at a tool show
and even tho' its grey and black color scheme matched my Porter-Cable
tools, it lasted long enough to make one and a half cutouts in a piece of
plywood...&quot;O'Malley Tools&quot; is headquartered in Texas, but the tool is made
in China... ;-(
