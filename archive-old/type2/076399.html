Subject: Re: [T2] Spare tire hold down? and parts for sale

&gt; Truth be told, I've been operating without either
the bolt or the 
plate
and
&gt; everything is just fine.  The tire does not wiggle
around, make 
noise, or
&gt; pose any threat of escaping.  And with the plastic
cover in place, 
who
will
&gt; ever know?

mine wiggled and made noise, even WITH the strap in
place ('77 model). so i put it up on the nose, 1 so it
wouldnt wiggle and, 2 to cover up that nasty deer
dent.

&gt;First time you hit something and the unsecured spare
flies forward, 
crushing
&gt;your head or that of one of your family
members/passengers, you'll 
know.

well, i can vouch for that, as i rolled my bus over
just the other day. altough the spare didnt fly up and
hit me (it was mounted on the front), EVERYTHING ELSE
in the bus came up and hit me on the head on it way
out the windshield hole. stuff like camping equipment
(tent poles) and stereo equipment (2x10 speaker box +
2 amps) and various other misc. i have multiple cuts
and bruises on my noggin, and i must have been knocked
out for at least 30-45 minutes from what i can
recollect, cuz all i remember is going off the road
toward some trees, then waking up.

&gt;Maybe more likely in a rollover, but still...I'd want
it secured. 

try VERY likely in a rollover. there was more stuff
around my bus than still in it after the wreck.

&gt; It's 
not
like no one's ever rolled a Bus before (John Anderson,
looking in your
direction). :-)

or me. this happened when i was coming home from a
party on xmas eve. you can see how merry my xmas has
been. i drove 20 miles before I wrecked within 2 miles
of my house.

DONT DRINK AND DRIVE!!  EVER!!   ask me how i know.

the bus is totaled. i had it towed to my house where i
am basically stripping everything that's still good.
these items will be for sale, so email me with what
you need. i will be putting up a website soon with
parts available and asking prices. have to pay the
lawyer somehow. sorry the engine is not available, it
will be going into my bug so i might still have
transportation.

and i had just done a whole bunch of work to it. d*mn.

glad i was wearing my seatbelt. i was extremely lucky
to walk away with only cuts and bruises. if i had had
a passenger they probably would not have survived.
(just wait for the pictures)

counting my blessings,
