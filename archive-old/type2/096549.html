Subject: Re: [T2] Today's fun

Richard,

Plugs look ok to me, maybe a little lean, but FI does that.

The one on the top left looks a little more normal to me, but it also 
depends on what kind of driving you have been doing on them...If i 
remember correctly, you drive about 5 miles back and forth to work each 
day?

The insulators look a little too white, and the surrounding looks too 
rich to match the insulator.  The electrodes actually look almost new!

Just my 2 cents.

Cheers, dave.

&gt; After 5 months of running I'm starting to get a feel for the personality of
&gt; my bus: what grade of gas it prefers here, how long it needs to warn up,
&gt; etc.
&gt; 
&gt; * tires
&gt; 
&gt; I've found it's not at all forgiving about tire pressures.  A few pounds
&gt; down in the front and it's much harder to steer and there is a lot more road
&gt; noise.  I'm going to make a point of checking them more often than once a
&gt; month.
&gt; 
&gt; My other car never lost any air in the tires but after I had a new set
&gt; mounted they slowly leaked all the time.  I had the bus tires mounted at the
&gt; same place, Discount Tire.
&gt; 
&gt; * valves
&gt; 
&gt; I finally changed the valve adjustment screws today (the bus-unfriendly
&gt; apartment mgmt is on holiday!) and I did a compression test after.  All 8
&gt; screws were quite worn and 1.5 turns in with the new ones seems good so far.
&gt; One lifter was more than 2.5 turns and the rest were all over the place.
&gt; Compared to solid lifters it's easy to adjust and I think it's worth an
&gt; investigation if you don't know how long ago they were adjusted.
&gt; 
&gt; I wish the compression gauge I bought from mighty-vac had a finer scale but
&gt; all four cylinders are reading 130-135 so I'm happy.
&gt; 
&gt; What a time saver a remote starter is.  I bought one with a red light to
&gt; indicate battery on/off.  I got a little worried after I was done with the
&gt; compression test because I couldn't start with the key but realized I forget
&gt; to reconnect the red/black wire to the starter.
&gt; 
&gt; * plugs
&gt; 
&gt; Can someone read these plugs for me. They are W8CC. #1 is top-left. 2-4-3
&gt; are clockwise from #1.
&gt; 
&gt; http://homepage.mac_dot_com/ratwell/.Pictures/Maintenance2/176-4Plugs.jpg
&gt; 
&gt; They don't match the standard Haynes plug color plate.  Are these plugs
&gt; clean or lean?  The only other plugs I've seen were the ones removed after
&gt; the first start in 4 years; they were disgusting.
&gt; 
&gt; After I did the compression test I forgot to reconnect the plug to the AFM.
&gt; When I realized the bus would start but not rev I figured out what was wrong
&gt; and decided to take a look at the plugs: they had turned black and sooty.
&gt; I'm kind of surprised the bus ran at all...I guess this soot will burn off?
&gt; 
&gt; * FYI
&gt; 
&gt; After the valve adjustment I redid the dwell, timing and idle.  Afterwards,
&gt; I took off the vac-line to the distributor when I went to tighten up the
&gt; distributor hex-bolt but forgot to put it back.  Went for a test-drive and
&gt; the bus burped every now especially under acceleration.  It fell a lot like
&gt; I had a clogged filter. Good to know.
&gt; 
&gt; Everything's back to normal and running great. What a pleasure to drive. I
&gt; may need that rev-limiting rotor after all!
&gt; 
&gt; Once last question. 50 and 52 are stamped in my heads on the inside.  What
&gt; do these numbers this mean?
&gt;
