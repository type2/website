Subject: help! 71 IGN SWITCH

HElp!

I am having trouble removing the ign lock assembly from the steering 
column of my 71 Bus. I do not have the key as I bought the bus for $250 
with a engine fire. The column and lock are fairly well dismantled, but 
it seems to be wedged in tight against the external facia cover. Removed 
all screws, including a really tiny one I will be lucky to find again if 
I lose. What do I do?

TIA
