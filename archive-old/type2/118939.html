Subject: Engine woes

We recently gave in and dropped our '77 bay off at a reputable local VW
mechanic.  What started out as an engine job to fix a severe leaking rear
(or fly wheel) seal has turned into a complete engine replacement.  Just one
example of the other things that we found wrong was a zero compression #4
cylinder.

The problem is I'm broke and the bill has already reached $2000.00.  As much
as I hate to ask this, if we sell our bay, is it worth at least that much to
a buyer?

The body has a little rust, mostly surface stuff, and the drive train will
be completely rebuilt except for the CVC joints.  (I know I should replace
them, but the ones on there are in moderately good shape, and the bill will
only go higher if we add them in with the rest of it.  I was going to
replace both of them with new complete CVC/axle assemblies myself at a later
date.)  The rest of the interior needs work.

The mech is using a rebuilt engine with my exhaust, carburetor, and etc..
The drive train should be like new after he's done.

Barring a miracle, which we are actively praying for, selling may be my only
other option.  Any ideas?
