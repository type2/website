Subject: FI vs carbs, and the 231K mu bus broke down (for 20 min)= boot woes!

I've been silent on this so far; reading Andrew Wood's reply to Robert
Wallace (Hey Bob, any highlander genes in you? :) spurred a reply of
Friday worth-
Comment on the fuel pump being inside the tank- yes it's common to
modern cars; we paid $400 to have it replaced in a Nissan Quest/aka
Mercury Villager, because of the labor involved.  Another downside is
how do you keep rust and other tank contaminants from affecting  the
pump?  You can't change a filter in the tank!  
     Regarding FI vs carbs- it's a matter of the cost of simplicity vs
efficiency-  Solar power is much more efficient than turning turbines
with BTU's or water, but who is using it when the cost is so high?  Cars
went to FI and passed the cost to us because of tightening emission
standards- then efficiency became &quot;worth it&quot;.  Who cared about the
availability of a more complex series of parts or repair knowhow 20
years or more later?
Now we late bus owners bear the responsibility of a learning curve more
involved than swapping out one or two carbs or cleaning them out-
whether we learn it or pay someone else for their learning.
     When something does go wrong it's usually more catastrophic than a
dirty carb or stuck float, and it can take much longer to figure out
what's wrong.  Case in point, MY trusty 78 Westy began to &quot;miss&quot;: and
act like it was running out of gas or a wire was falling off somewhere,
so I pulled over by a road crew and dug out the spare gallon (thinking
I'd forgotten to record my last fillup, necessary as gauge reads empty
after using 6 gall.!)   It started, ran, but hesitated, so I decided to
head for the nearest gas station and did fill it up- hmmm- only 7
gallons to fill....and it wouldn't start so they pushed it into the
corner.  Time for all one can really do quickly, check the wires and
hoses.....that tiny hose going to that invisible port behind the
throttle was falling off (end was split, so I renewed it and had to get
the upper hatch open to see to reattach it.  Nada on starting (a vauge
catch here and there).  A curious bystander offered help, so he held the
coil wire while I cranked, fine spark!  Feeling the fuel pump while
cranking revealed zip (hey he offered to feel it) - bad relay? Bad
pump?   Didn't feel like going to the AFM flap route (gotta pull the air
cleaner and get dirty) so I got out the cardboard hiding under the rear
bed and got under there with the minimag in the teeth and checked out
the pump connections- looked OK, but when I checked under the boots, the
+ wire connector was like totally loose and explained the &quot;intermmitant&quot;
operation I was getting- crimped the connector a bit with needlenose
wires, it held and all OK.  
   A footnote- I had recently UNWIRED my heater box flaps due to this
eastern warm spell, then closed them again last weekend after the
punkinchunkin.....probably bumped the connector enough to loosen its
hold.
Moral- those boots hide a lot of evidence!!!!!!
