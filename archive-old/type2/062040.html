Subject: grinds and growls :(

So I just finished my brake job, new brake hoses up front and new
disks, fixed the axial play in the right front wheel, so the van is
all nice and ready for reinspection and for BBTA. Drove a few miles,
harshly testing the new brakes and they're doing their job. Burned
some tire. 

And now, all of a sudden, after a three-point turn, I get this heart
stopping loud clunking noise as if the transaxle is going to break off
and separate from the bus. It's only there on deceleration,
proportional to speed, so I figure a CV joint is in a lot of pain. Or
could some dirt have gotten into the front bearing when I repacked it? 
Opinions and predictions welcome. :) I don't know; I'm just very, very
tired of all this. The grinding refers to my teeth.

PS: what's the best point to place the hydraulic jack if I want to
lift the whole rear axle? (I've done this before, but I'm not so sure
anymore. Must have been smarter back then.)
