Subject: starter solenoid replacement

Hi John,
I don't think you can replace the solenoid with the starter installed.  The
trick would be dealing with the relay lever that hooks the solenoid to the
drive gear.  It's not hard to pull the starter.  The top bolt holds the
starter on and also is the top right engine to transmission bolt.  You get
to the nut from inside the engine compartment.
