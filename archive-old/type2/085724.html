Get what?  The relay?  Got mine from the local wrecking yard.  Old 
watercooled VW's are full of good relays.  Your local FLAPS should have them 
too.  As would your local auto stereo installer.

&gt;Who'd you get it from?

&gt; &gt; If that(checking your cable connections) doesn't do the trick, check the
&gt; &gt; ground strap from the tranny to the frame.  Also, check to make sure the
&gt; &gt; solenoid is really receiving 12v from the ignition switch.  Check all 
&gt;your
&gt; &gt; fuse block connections and clean them if needed.  You may have too much
&gt; &gt; resistance in the long wire from the ign. sw. to the starter(usually
&gt;caused
&gt; &gt; by corrosion.  One way to get around this is to add a 30A, SPDT Bosch
&gt;relay
&gt; &gt; to the circuit.  I have done this to my '70, and it works great.

&gt; &gt; &gt;My 70 PopTop wont turn over unless I hook jumpers cables up to the
&gt; &gt; &gt;battery... Battery is good, but she wont turn over any suggestions??
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;Thanks,
