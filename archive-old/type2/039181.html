Subject: RE: Exhaust Wrap Good Idea?

A cautionary word about header wrap.

The wrap works very well at keeping heat inside of the header or exhaust.
This will accelerate the effects of heat on the inside of the tube.  The
racing parts catalog I have states that header life is significantly reduced
with the use of the wrap.  It does however have all the good benefits
previously mentioned.  Note:  I have not tried this product, so I cannot
report with first hand knowledge.
