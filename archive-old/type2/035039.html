New windshields cost so much that you really ought to consider just
doing without.

Split window owners pay lotsa money for &quot;Safari Windows&quot; which leak in
the rain anyway. Why should they have all the fun?
Don't buy a windshield! Instead, save your money and simply invest in a
good pair of ski goggles for windy conditions.
Your friends will be impressed when you tell them how much money you
saved in just windshield wiper blades alone, and your hair will always
have that &quot;wind blown&quot; look, so popular nowadays.

Just looking out for your best interests.
