Subject: Ignition Lock Enigma

Hiya All,

The mechanical part of the ignition lock gave up the ghost over the weekend.  One minute it worked just fine, the next minute it was the AAA.  
Anyway, here's the deal.......... I really want to keep on using my present key because it opens all the doors.  So, can I get a replacement ignition switch at my FLAPS and have it rekeyed to fit my present key?  Or would it be a better idea to scavenge an old ignition switch barrel and have a locksmith rebuild it (assuming that such a thing is even possible)?
I need some key advice to lock down this issue.  Sorry, must be some sort of a compulsion.

Mike
