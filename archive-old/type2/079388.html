&gt; &gt; The easiest way to fit the sliding door seal is to undo the two bolts
&gt; &gt; that hold the rear sliding hinge mechanism onto the door (these are to
&gt; &gt; be seen from INSIDE of the bus just below the window). Then with the
&gt; &gt; door ajar, WHILE SUPPORTING THE DOOR (bloks, axle stand, jack,
&gt; &gt; helper...), pull the hinge mechanism out, pop the seal through the
&gt; &gt; gap, slide the hinge back into the door. In my experience this is much
&gt; &gt; easier than removing the track cover and takeing the slider off of the
&gt; &gt; track.
&gt; 
&gt; Err... Bob....
&gt; 
&gt; On US spec buses there are four bolts.  Two are accesible from inside the
&gt; bus, at the rear of the door about half way up. If your bus is a passenger
&gt; model and very original they may be covered with black plastic caps.  The
&gt; other two are inside the rear lip of the door.  Pop the door open and look
&gt; in the gap at the rear.  All four are 10mm heads.  After they are out,
&gt; removal of the hinge goes as you say.
&gt; 
&gt; On replacement, it is important to center the door in its opening at the
&gt; rear for the seal to do its job.  A two-person job, alas, with someone
&gt; holding the door in position while the second snugs the bolts.
