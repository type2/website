Subject: vacuum distributor hoses

Hi All,

I've been playing with timing, idle, etc. on Lily (1972 Campmobile, 1700 rebuilt
to 2000, dual solex carbs, stock dist.) and decided to replace the 2 vacuum 
hoses on the distributor.

Questions:

1.  Should I stay with the braided hoses (when I went to parts store, they 
said &quot;no&quot;)
2.  Is there a &quot;spec&quot; size for both hoses? What are the correct sizes for the 2
hoses?
(Parts stores i went to do not have the exact same size as the hoses presently 
connected to my distributor)
3.  Do I need to go to a vw shop for the correct sizes?  
4.  Is it critical that one stay with the spec sizes?
5.  Which hose goes where?  (as I cannot be certain that the present set-up is
correct)
6.  Finally, why is one hose bigger than the other?

I have checked the archives but these questions were not specifically answered.

Thanks to all,

Dale G
