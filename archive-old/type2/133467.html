&gt; Just trying to see if i have my 76 dialed in...................I got 90 on a

&gt; gas prices.

this is almost reaching &quot;FART&quot; stage along with tires.....

but

I have a 78FI with auto tranny (so I don't expect better fuel mileage)
the bay has a gas tank of slightly more than 14 gallons. so you can do the
math.  doubt if you'll ever see 28.5 except downhill with a  tailwind.

listening to folks here and personal experience you should be able to
expect 16-19 around town with all the stop and go. and might be able to
get a little more than 20 on the road with carefull speed management.

there are exceptions but there is always a &quot;But&quot; in them.  if you drive
pretty much normally expect something in th 17-20 mile per gallon long
term average.  (slightly less with an automatic)
