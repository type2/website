&gt; I'm sure if we had a show of hands, there are a number of people who do not
&gt; carry the most simple insurance to burning down a bus.  I carry two fire
&gt; extinguishers, just incase one isn't enough.  I have been invovled in two VW
&gt; fires, one in a bug and one in a bus that I was driving, but many more with
&gt; other's VW's in caravans.  People get the idea from TV that &quot;it's going to
&gt; blow!!!!&quot; but they don't, they just burn like crazy.

I will add to this check the d*mn thing for a charge too.  had put an
engine in that had sat for a while and a mouse had built a nest in the
heat duct of the engine.  well a little oil and muffler heat ignited this
mess.  new gas lines but it was smokey.
  grabbed the ext from behind my seat, pulled pin,  nothing, nada, zip.

ooooooooooooooohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh ssssshhhhhh*ttttttttt  
my bus was saved by a nearby person who used thier own ext on my fire,
wouldn't take dime for replacing it either......I also keep a 2 liter
bottle of water nearby, won't work on the gas but will help knock down any
leftover smouldering materiels, also will cool things down so they don't
reignite

only other fire I had was with an almost new 412 when the cold start valve
failed and was dumping fuel...ext worked and the fire was quickly out. and
the 412 was back on the road in about a week.  

one thing I have noticed, I have used my ext on other cars, and only on
the VW's was the ext big enough to actually put out the fire...the other
cars were either still lost or it took more ext to put it out.  
(a 20BC-5A) is what I usually carry, although I'm looking for a decent
sized CO2  which leaves no residue.    on the other fire put outs, it took
more to clean up the mess than to actually fix the damage..(but at least
the vehicle was saved)
