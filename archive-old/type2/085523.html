&gt; While I can't directly comment on how hard/PITA working on a dual carb
&gt; setup is. You don't want to force this issue. I would get any specific
&gt; opinions about your bus from the mech (sounds like you have already)
&gt; and keep those at the back of your mind. Making a mech work on
&gt; something he either doesn't feel comfortable with or doesn't like will
&gt; only give you greif. I can see 2 months down the road him simply
&gt; saying &quot;well I said you would have this problem, but you insisted&quot;.
&gt; Start looking around for another mech or buy the muir &amp; work it
&gt; yourself.
&gt; 

Already done. My poor Muir book looks war torn and beat. Time for a new one
maybe. I have no problems working on it myself. However I guess I need to
find out where I can get the tools needed to balance the carbs.
