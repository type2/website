Subject: Re: [T2] idle in D problem after car is warm.

I would check for vac leaks,, assuming you did the tune up recently in warm
weather, and nothing else has deteriorated,,,


and I am really thankful I don't live In Saskatchewan,,, - 22 Degrees Celsius!!!

 Just bought a seasons pass to the ski hill,, and it hasn't gone below freezing
here!

&gt;      I have noticed a problem with the my 79 Westy (automatic,FI) that
&gt; started Tuesday of this week. It starts great  - 22 Degrees Celsius - No
&gt; prob! (as long as the block heater is plugged in). I let it warm up for a
&gt; good 10 minutes and she starts off fine. About 5 - 10 minutes into driving,
&gt; I will get stopped by a light or traffic sign and the bus will idle real
&gt; rough, the generator light will then flicker and the bus will shake.
