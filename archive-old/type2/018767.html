     Trip Report Part I
          or
Adventures in Air Cooled Animals

Sometimes things just don't work out like planned.  And even sometimes,
they're better.

I left Houston last Wednesday afternoon, a week later than originally
anticipated.  My brother found that he needed to return to Lincoln
quickly, so we flew him out and then I took my time about getting Rita
('73 Westy, 914 motor) ready for travel.  She needed her interior
reassembled and a little tuning up.

In putting the stock Westy interior back in I found that the Q-pads/Kool
Patch had changed the clearances on everything just enough to be
excruciatingly frustrating.  My well planned out and simple carpet
pattern had to be butchered into something far holier, if less graceful.
 I've got enough carpet left in Houston that I'll be able to make a
&quot;final&quot; cut when I return.  I knew there was a reason I purchased extra.

The paneling looked beautiful once reinstalled.  I had refinished it,
but this was the first time that I saw it all back in the van.  I had
originally only intended to refinish the roof panels, and then upholster
the wall panels.  My brother thankfully convinced me to do otherwise and
instead refinish all of the panels.  Real wood in an automobile.  It
positively glows.  I'm sure Mr. Hineline would approve.

Curtains, seat cushions -- all redone.  Some minor adjustments are
needed, but otherwise, everything looks great.  Now I just have to
finish up the front cabin... will this project ever end?  BTW, I'll have
some interior stuff to offer when I get back.

Okay, so I went on to the engine.  I'd been putting it off to keep bad
news at bay even longer.  The van was running, but...

Tune-up went wonderfully.  It was the first time I did everything myself
and it was empowering.  Only mishap was putting the wrong wires on plugs
number 1 and 2.  I'll never do that again.  Even did the compression
test, and it was 110, 115, 115, 115.  That put me somewhat at ease. 
Could be better, but could be far far worse.

So all I had to do was pack and go.  As I'm sure veteran Westy owners
can attest to, there is an art to packing a Camper.  Last Wednesday, I
was merely fingerpainting.  Everything was thrown in.  But I had to get
out of Houston.  I had to put Rita on the road.  Katu, ('98 Maine Coon
Cat) of course, didn't share my enthusiasm.  His furriness made me as
concerned about his ability to shed heat as I was about Rita's.  Being
the only watercooled animal of the three of us, I was at an advantage in
the Texas climate.  Of course, in 100% humidity, is questionable.  We
left anyway.

Drove to Arlington where I stopped at my ex in-laws' place for the
night.  This first leg was luckily uneventful.  The cat quickly settled
down under the wet bandana (external cooler).  The van ran beautifully
at 55mph, and got a wonderful 23mpg!  That night we all cooled down,
rested, and steeled ourselves for the journey beyond.

The next day I waited out the heat of the afternoon by repacking (I'm at
the level of drawing stick figures now) and fixing a turn signal
grounding problem.  Bled the brakes.  Oil loss was acceptable (3/4
quart) considering the distance and heat.  I left Arlington around 4 pm,
narrowly missed rush hour traffic, and headed on.

I made it to Del City (south of OKC) with a new high of 24mpg.  The
outside temps were bad, but I felt that keeping it at 55 mph was
acceptable.  Gotta get me some gauges to keep better track of what's
going on back there.  Discovered a bit of a growl in second, but that
may be only when I rest my hand on the gear shift.  I hope it's not the
tranny.  At Del City I stopped for a break at a friend's.  Oil loss was
a bit heavier that day, but then the outside temps were higher.  Around
9 pm things were getting pleasant, and I decided to head on for the
Kansas border.

Night driving was much more to Katu's liking.  By that time he had
adjusted to the noise levels and had discovered that the most
comfortable place in the bus was right under the clutch pedal.  I'm not
sure what he saw in it, but I certainly didn't share his enthusiasm for
the spot.  So he alternately tried my lap, the dashboard, the passenger
seat, and settled on the sink.

As I neared the border my energy waned, so I pulled into a rest area and
put Rita to the test.  Tended to the cat's needs.  Ate and drank a
little from my stores.  Then pulled out the bed, moved a bit of baggage
and went to sleep.  All from inside the van.  Very very nice.

I slept for a couple of hours, then woke and decided to press on while I
had the cool of night.  A few hours later the same I did the same
routine just past Wichita at a turnpike service area.  Slept until dawn
(when the cat woke me) and decided to finish up the drive.

Fortunately, a low pressure front had moved across the Plains so it was
cool and rainy.  Driving was mostly pleasant, especially since I was now
off the Interstate and travelling by way of US 77.  That's what the bus
was made for.  Every American should see what the Heartland of this
country is like from the back roads at 55 mph.  Interstate travel
doesn't do it justice.

Temperature wasn't a concern until I reached Manhattan, KS, when I
stopped at a gas station.  Between the humidity (rainy weather) and the
heat of the engine, the resistance had built up and I had those VW Bus
hot-start blues (there ought to be a song).  Luckily, a previous owner
had installed a hot-start button in the engine compartment, so I went
around, popped it once, and was on my way.  Made it to my folk's house
in Lincoln a few hours later on Friday.

Rita's been parked since.  She's going to get tuned up again in a day or
two.  I need to check out that growl (it's not the tranny... I hope).
But right now we're both resting.  Katu's content, and apparently not
too scarred from the trip.  The weather here is gorgeous.  I think I'm
really going to like this Bus-travel thing.  :)
