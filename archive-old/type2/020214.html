Subject: FS: 78 exhaust parts...

Hi folks...

My e-mail impaired buddy is converting a '78 engine over to the early
('72-'74) style exhaust system (for use in his '73 Station wagon) and
has both the manifolds and the u-shaped tubes that connect the manifolds
to the heaterboxes up FS...

    He'd like to get $75-$100 + shipping for all the pieces...

    Heaterboxes were junk....

    We're located in southern NH...
