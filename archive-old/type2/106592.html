Subject: Fw: [T2] Upper Starter Bolt

 one tip that most people forget is to run a tap or die over your bolts and
 holes. When the nut goes on like butter the bolt is less likely to turn.
 Another hint, if its a bay with an upright and you've only have that one
 pesky nut left, you can remove the moustache bar and lower the engine
enough
 to get it on, few extra minutes work, but often better than an hour of
 frustration.
