Subject: Re: [T2] if it ain't one thing...

i have an alternator instead of a gen. i have heard people suggest this
before. i got one because i couldnt figure out if my electrical problem
was generator related or because of the voltage regulator... this killed
two gremlins with one replacement... and i think the alt cost the same as
the gen. dont remember, i got it a couple years ago.

be advised there are parts around it that need to be replaced as well. i
had to replace the gen stand with an alt stand, the fuel pump had to be
replaced because my 70 bus one was too tall for the new lower position of
the alternator. i am sure there were other things that had to be changed,
but as far as i can remember, those were the only parts i had to
replace...

QUESTION: is the alt generally a 12v or 6v or does it matter?

70 westy without dimming lights (advantage of alt over gen)
