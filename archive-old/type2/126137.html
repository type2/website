&gt;I am having trouble removing the fan from my Type IV engine.
&gt;I want to replace the engine seal behind it to stop a leak.

The fan easily comes off with 3 bolts. The harder part is removing the hub. There was a plate used as a tool to press the hub off using the fan bolts. Bentley has a photo. How are you going to remove the hub and press it back on?
