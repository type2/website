Subject: tar in gas tank

I've seen this before in junk yard busses -- black gooey tar-like
substance slowly (imperceptibly) oozing out of the gas outlet (and, in
the case of this fuel injected vehicle, out of the return inlet too).
I'm assuming this is a product of old long bad gasoline; and, given the
wide range of expertise on this list, I wouldn't be surprised is
somebody has the chemical lowdown of this stuff -- and I'll be duly
impressed by the display of such knowledge.  But what I really want to
know is how to rid a gas tank of this goo.  Will a (long?) soaking in
new gas do the trick?

BTW, what am I supposed to do with the bad gasoline that drained
(slowly!) from this tank (and with any new gas I use to clean it out,
too)?  Is is still volatile?  I can recycle oil easily; so I suppose I
can simply add a quart of bad gas to my used motor oil every time I take
some of that to the local recycling center.
