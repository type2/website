Subject: Two Strokes (2 cycle) engines

Okay, two stroke (cycle) engines...

It took me years before I really understood a two cycle engine.  Here's how
they work...

First you have to realize that two things are happening at once... and that
there are no valves as such.  The piston and holes cut in the cylinder wall
do the valve function.

1.)  Piston moves up.  Piston skirt uncovers the intake port, draws intake
charge (Fuel, air &amp; OIL) into crankcase (below piston) from carb. Oil in
intake charge lubricates lower end.  Compresses mixture above piston.

2.)  Spark plug fires, driving piston down.  Piston crown uncovers the
exhaust port.  Burned gases flow to exhaust system. Piston covers intake
port. Piston compresses charge in crankcase.

3.)  Piston continues down.  Piston crown uncovers &quot;transfer ports&quot; which
allows compressed mixture to flow from crankcase to combustion chamber.
(the exhaust port is still open. Mixture will (and does) flow right on out
the exhaust.  That's why they are inherantly &quot;dirty&quot; engines.)

4.)  Piston begins to move back up and the whole process begins anew.

Note that you get a power impulse with every revolution of the crankshaft.
Two cycle (or two stroke) means that all this happens with one down stroke
and one upstroke.

If you have a Mac, I've a Hypercard stack that illustrates how this all
works.  Also shows four cycle and steam engines.  Drop me a line and I'll
forward it to you.

If you still can't picture it, let me know and I'll try to make it more
clear.  Just remember, more that one thing is going on at any given point
in this process.
