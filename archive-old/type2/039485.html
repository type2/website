Typically a freeway flier refers to replacing 4th gear in your transaxle 
with a taller (numerically lower) ratio.  This is not something that is 
easy for the average joe to do - you would need to contact a shop that 
rebuilds Volkswagen transaxles.  I'm told that installation requires 
disassembly of the transaxle, so it probably wouldn't be cost effective 
unless done in conjunction with a rebuild.

Now on to the more complicated issue - does your engine have the power 
necessary to handle the taller gearing?  If your motor is stock, the answer 
is most likely &quot;no&quot;.
