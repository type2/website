&gt; 	Bob - with all due respect, OG Solexes are getting to be a real PITA
&gt; to get to work anymore, just ask listee Ben Huotx...  Ben's recently given
&gt; up in disgust, and installed a proggy Weber on his '73.  Not sure that it's
&gt; a step in the right direction, but what ever trips yer trigger...

well what I put on my 1700 spare engine (in other words not much
money) was a Fuel Injection system from a 1971 411 sedan,  ran very well
(for an old engine) and costs a total was less than $100

&gt; rebuilt set of 34 Solexes will set you back.  When you are done crying,
&gt; investigate how much a good aftermarket EFI rig will s*ck out of your
&gt; pocketbook.

that would be my second choice,  yes FI can be a PITA to learn and get
right but having had dual carbs I never want to have to keep those
buggers working ever again, I went FI about 10 years ago exclusively and
haven't looked back

as always YMMV
