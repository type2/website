Subject: Seat Belts For Middle Seat
Message-Id: &lt;3.0.3.32.19990420065628.007bec60_at_pop.conknet_dot_com&gt;

	Any sources for lap belts for the middle seat in my 7 passenger?  The
mounting bolts are located on the floorboard directly behind the seat so I
assume the straps have to be relatively long.  Also is there a source for
the perforated vinyl type material which is glued onto the area below the
side windows?

Thanks,
