Subject: Re: [T2] Battery tray welding question

If he is very good with thin rod...  Body metal is very thin for welding
prone to easy burn-through as well as deformation (basically a real PITA!).
Much nicer to use a thin wire MIG setup (gas not flux-cored).

YMMV

Subject: [T2] Battery tray welding question


&gt; This evening, I mentioned to a friend that the battery
&gt; tray in my new 72 westy was severly rusted through. He
&gt; said that he has an arc welder and that wouldn't be a
&gt; super hard job to weld in a replacement.
&gt; Is he right ie-is an arc welder suitable for such a task?
&gt; (please forgive my near complete ignorance on the
&gt; subject of welding. I was forced to take college-prep
&gt; classes in high school)
&gt;
&gt; TIA--
