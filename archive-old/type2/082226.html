Subject: A Horny Problem

Hiya All,

So I'm messing around with the horn on my 70 Bus in an effort to get it to 
sound off consistently in a somewhat clear tone.  It had a bit of a froggy 
sound and wouldn't beep every time when the button was hit.  &quot;Crummy ground 
somewhere&quot;,  I thought after bench testing the horn.  (It was fine!)  Turns 
out that the ground wire from the horn to the top of the steering coupler (I 
couldn't see the male end but I'm supposing it's up there) was just barely 
connected and came completely loose as I was checking the wires.  And that is 
now my new problem.  How the heck does one reconnect this wire without 
completely removing the steering box and coupler?
