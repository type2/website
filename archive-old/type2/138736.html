Subject: Re: [T2] Spare your zapping finger

I rarely respond to hot topics like this, but, This is not one of those 
lists. Everyone is intitled to as many questions as they can think of 
including you. Many of your questions have brought out great answers that I 
use every time I work on my bus. Shure some of your questions have no 
relavance to my bus, just as some of my questions have no relavance to 
others buses. Oh Well! The topics that don't apply to me, I just skip over.

To (mis)quote some famous person, &quot;I may not agree with every thing you say, 
but I'll defend your right to say it.

I recommend you just ignore those who are not ignoring you. Ask your 
questions &amp; get your answers. Lets be happy :)

75 bus &quot;Turtlebus&quot;
80 Westy &quot;as yet unnamed&quot;
Bus-ted minds want to know

&gt; I make it a rule never to subscribe to a list where people don't want
&gt; to use it, and don't want other people to use it. Didn't know this was
&gt; one of those lists until today.
