&gt; OK.  Why do you disconnect the battery by removing the ground cable??

&gt; What's so bad about removing the power cable??

If, while loosening the positive cable, your wrench should encounter the
body of the car you will get some impressive sparks.

However, if you are loosening the ground cable, the only thing you have to
avoid with your wrench is the positive terminal itself.  Much safer!

While I'm on the subject of batteries, here's how to keep your terminals
happy:

To clean the clamps, submerge them in a very hot solution of baking
soda and water.  This will react with any acid that might be on the
terminal.  Hot solution works faster and, after you remove the terminal
from the solution, allows the terminal to dry faster.

To clean the battery terminals themselves, apply the same solution
sparingly.  Be sure to keep it out of the battery's vents!  Wipe the
terminal clean.

Be sure that the clamps and terminals are clean and dry before proceeding.

Give the clamps and terminals a good coating of petroleum jelly.  Take the
bolts out of the clamps and be sure that the threads and holes are all
coated.  Reinstall the clamps (positive first!) and tighten them down
snugly.  Excess petroleum jelly will squeeze out, which you can just smear
onto the outside of the clamp.

Using this method, I never have corrosion problems on my batteries.  It
takes a few minutes, but saves a lot of hassle later on.  If you remove
the clamps later on, just put a film of petroleum jelly on the post and
inside the clamp and the seal is maintained.
