&gt; &gt; The correct tap is an 8mm x 1.25 STI. STI is an abbreviation for
&gt; &gt; Standard Thread Insert. A better solution, if you have the 'meat' for it
&gt; &gt; is to use a Timesert or Keensert.

&gt; I agree, though it is intresting to note that the new Mexican engines come
&gt; with helicoils in all three mustache bar holes from the factory.  They
&gt; work fine if correctly applied and may be better for deep hole
&gt; applications.  Do the Tim/Keenserts come in deep versions?

Keenserts are also for STI taps, and very expensive kits. Deep? Sure.
VW case savers are also deep, cheap, and common metric taps.
