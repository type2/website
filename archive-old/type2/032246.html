Subject: 2 small engine parts from '77 needed can pay
Message-ID: &lt;Pine.SOL.4.02A.9905171014060.6936-100000_at_insci14.ucsd_dot_edu&gt;

I need two little engine bits which I have lost and am tired of looking
for.

1) the oil drain plug/oil strainer retaining bolt.  The funny little thing
which holds the plate below the oil strainer in place.

2) one (1) of the valve lifter screws.  These are the threaded pieces
which you adjust when you adjust you valve clearence.  They are rounded on
one end and have a slotted screwdriver face on the other.  Its about 2-3 
cm long and very fat compared to the type 1 part, maybe this is 10 mm x
1.25 or so, I cant recall and am away from my garage right now.  San Diego
would be the best place to find them, cause I could pick them up,
otherwise the mail would be cheap enough since they are small.  I figure
$10 for both, but you tell me.

Thanks in adcance!
