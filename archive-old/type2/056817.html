Subject: RE: rear hatch

&gt;There's something puzzling about this thread. Why would anyone 
&gt;who is concerned about safety allow children to ride in the back 
&gt;anyway? Isn't this illegal in all 50 states by now? (Drunks are another
&gt;matter.)

I agree with the possible danger of a rear latch, and kids falling out.
But is there really a safe place for a inquisitive kid to ride?

When I was three years old I opened the back door of a four door Toyota
and fell out while the car was in full motion. I guess I was just playing
with the rear handle, the door opened and out I popped. Apparently my
dad just kept driving and my sister had to tell him that I fell out.
It was Father's day and my mother spent the day scrubbing gravel off
my body with a firm brush, ouch.

Moral of the story: kids can get in to trouble anywhere in a car. If they're in
the back there is no way you can ever keep an eye on them. Strap em down nice
and close to you. 

This leads me to another thought, maybe people with kids shouldn't have oil
temp gauges. On a hot day while your eyeing your temp you could be miles
down the road before you realize you're one passenger short.
