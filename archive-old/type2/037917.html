Subject: What kind of carb is this &amp; why does it hesitate?

I've got a 1975 bus that was equipped by a previous owner with an upright 
engine.  As far as I know, the engine is from a 1971 bug - but I would not 
bet that the carburetor matches a '71 bug.

So, 1st question:  The carb is labeled &quot;30/31 PICT&quot; the on the side.  It 
looks in every other respect like a 30 PICT-3, but I can't find any listing 
for it in the Bentley 1968-1979 Type 2 Service Manual or in the Idiot's 
Guide.  So what is it?  Do I treat it just like a 30 PICT-3?

2nd question:  The specific problem I'm trying to solve is a major 
hesitation when attempting to move from idle to acceleration.  This engine 
has also developed an unwillingness to idle until it is warmed up (then it 
idle's fine).  According to Bentley, this is probably a problem with a 
blockage in the area of the accelerator pump/pilot jet, but I'm wondering 
if anyone has any other things to check.  This engine is equipped with a 
.009 distributor with Pertronics electonic ignition, timed to 10' BTDC.

Thanks in advance for the help.  I also want to say thanks for the 
resources I've found at type2_dot_com.  The tech bulletin on adjusting the 
automatic choke is going to be really helpful on this car &amp; is just one 
example of things I've found here that I've needed to know but didn't have 
a resource to check.  THANKS!
