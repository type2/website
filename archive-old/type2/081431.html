Subject: Re: [T2] towing question


MAJOR thing about it
&gt; compared to a trailer is YOU CAN'T BACK UP.  So you have to really
&gt; plan ahead.  I understand that if you get really good with them you can
&gt; learn to reverse short distances completely straight but steering and
&gt; reversing doesn't happen as you got two pivot points.

Uh ya, there is that, especially the ones with the pivoting decks. In my
case the drive is off a downhill with no exit, they 'can' be backed up if
done slowly and if you start dead straight. Otherwise Fagaddabotit
