Subject: Tail Light Housing Seal?
Message-ID: &lt;37007838.15E_at_injersey_dot_com&gt;

While doing some cosmetic surgery on the rear of my bus, I found that
there was no seal between the plastic tail light housing (the bulb
receptacle) and the body.

RMMW's catalog lists a &quot;Seal, Tail Light, Housing to Body&quot; for '72-'79
buses, part #411 941 123.

Can anyone else with a late Type 2 tell me whether their bus has such a
seal?

The peculiar number makes me wonder if this is an afterthought seal not
originally installed by the factory.

Windows choked with one of those inexplicable error messages just after
