Subject: Re: [T2] Re:discovered rocker rust (was cold weather painting)

Hiya Mike,

I caught just a couple of the posts in this thread and I thought I might chip 
in with what I found to be a very important factor in dealing with the rocker 
panels.

I think that the suggestions you have elicited have been very good - in 
theory.  But there is another consideration in saving a rocker.  Namely, what 
caused the rust inside the rocker in the first place?  In my case I found that the 
metal in the wheel wells just forward of the rockers had rusted out.  Oh, 
there was enough metal there to look OK at a casual glance but both sides were 
well perforated with rust.  That allowed dirt and water to be sprayed directly 
inside of the rocker panel.

I could have done the POR thing.  But I would have been spraying POR 15 
directly over dirt.  Not a good idea! And the wheel well spray business simply 
would have continued.  More rust - vicious cycle - you get the picture.

I'd urge you to get down there and really examine that area for openings 
which might be allowing crud to get inside the rocker.  That may save you a lot of 
grief down the road.

Mike
