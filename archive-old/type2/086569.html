Subject: Westy in Video

Trick Turner is the name of the group, the first scene is a lady on the
street trying to get a trick, she gets a undercover cop instead of a john,
then in the next few shots the cop opens the door to a westy and you see she
must be living in her bus and she has two children with her.

Cool Video! Check it out!

Meredith
