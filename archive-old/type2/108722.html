&gt; thats what i was thinking but wasnt sure...
&gt; so what would be the ebst way to cap the spare line off...

Mine's the same way, FI converted to a single Webber, short piece of line on
the unused fitting with a plug in the end of the line.

Just out of curiosity, could this return line be used to drain the tank?
(Unintentionally or intentionally?)

Thanks.
