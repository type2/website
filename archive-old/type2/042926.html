Subject: Oil in my Petrol !!

Hi volks,

   After poking around in my engine bay this evening, I have noticed my fuel 
filter (installed after fuel pump and before the carb) has what seems to be 
an oily mixture in it - complete with silt !!!! - This happened once about 
four months ago but changing the fuel filter cured the problem ?!?! Any 
ideas - I was thinking that the fuel pump could be leaking oil into the fuel 
pipes ?

Cheers in advance

Dave K.
