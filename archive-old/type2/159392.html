Subject: Re: [T2] in-car head removal - floating valve seat

&gt; Still can't afford to pay a mechanic to do as thorough a job as I do. I 
&gt; replace all the related seals, mounts, hoses and etc if they look 
&gt; questionable.

You know, that really is the reason why I never bring my car in to have 
anything done.  Then I know exactly what was done and even more 
important, I learn even more about how things work.  When it starts 
getting to really advanced measurements and machining, that's when I 
have to bring it in, though.  I just don't have the tools or time to 
learn how to properly machine parts.


&gt; That's how an oil change can turn into an engine compartment repaint... 
&gt; &lt;grin!&gt;

Yeah.... since I pulled the engine apart, I cleaned all the tin so it's 
nice and shiny again ;)
