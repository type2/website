Subject: [T2] Changing Muffler on 2cc 76 drivetrain

HI Volks,

I need to change the muffler on my bus. It has a OM
set-up on a 2cc FI drivetrain.  There are bolts on the
top of the tubes/pipes that conect to the muffler. 
These look very hard to get at with the engine in. 
Are there any tips or tricks for getting at this bolt
from to of the muffler on an OM set-up??? 
I can easily get to the bolts on the bottom.  It's the
one on the top that looks like a bear to get to. 
Should I take off the bumper??  Any ideas??
