Subject: Clutch noise

That's the same noise my bus is making that's got me scheduling an engine 
pull. Most likely pilot bearing. Did you grease it before installing your 
new motor?

&gt; when cold, the clutch is makes a brief screeching sound when upshifting,
mostly between 1st and 2nd, 2nd and 3rd. Only during that brief period
when it is slipping while the engine is engaging with the transaxle.
