Subject: [T2] 69 split for sale upstate south carolin


&gt; my boss came in this morning after seeing my bus in the parking lot and
says that he seen another bus yesterday for sale..
&gt; i asked about it but he didnt know if it was a split or bay or year or
condition just seen it ,,,
&gt; i called them and they said that it is a
&gt; 69 split with a 914 flathead engine in it...


Are you sure its a '69? They only made the split window bus up to '67. Id
look it over real well with that engine in it and make sure it was done
right. But for $550....if it runs and actually is a split might be a fun buy
and drive till it dies type of purchase.
