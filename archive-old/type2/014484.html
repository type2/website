Got a buddy that picked up a little wire-feed welder at the local Wal-Mart a few months ago for around 200 rocks. Could have been a one time special and we are in Ky...

Try Meijer, Harbor Freight, Sam's Club, WalMart - hell, check out the local flea market. You'll find one. 
If you have Big Lots or Odd Lots you would be surprised what pops up in the tools section from time to time.

&gt; James,
&gt; $200 - not likely, and if so, not a good welder. Now
&gt; for $300-$350 you can get a Lincoln SP-100, which is a
&gt; nice wire-feed welder, which is convertible to MIG.

&gt; &gt; but cannot for the life of me find any for less than
&gt; &gt; $400 which is
&gt; &gt; outside my financial scope,
