Subject: thanks, and more problems engin and olfactory

First of all, thanks to all of ya'll who replied to my questions about
timing/power/distributors.  I have decided it is indeed the advance
mechanism which is at fault.  I intend to stick with a 009 distributor,
tho, due to price, the fact that I have no idea where I'd put the vacuum
line, and that the 009 worked fine until now.

Second of all, I have a problem.  I bought this other bus, as a parts bus,
but as I started stripping it (for its distributor, as a matter of fact), I
started thinking that this bus (a 79) wasn't ready to die yet.  After all,
the body is in good shape, and it starts and runs (almost).  Bob, if he's
out there, knows this bus :)  BTW, Bob, how's the deluxe coming?

Anyway, here's the problem:  It will start, but its idle varies between
almost dying and about 1500 rpm, back and forth, back and forth.  I also
determined that it was missing on #'s one and three (i.e. pulling off the
plug wire produced no effect).  Things that have checked out OK: spark (at
the plug).  Injector (nice fine mist).  Lifters (pulling valve cover off
revealed rocker arms that are rocking very nicely).  My guess: Bad valves.
What do ya'll think?  If it's valves, what's the potential cost?  Do you
suppose it's worth it?

Finally of all, what the hell is that smell?  You surely know the smell I
mean.  I have smelled it no other place than VWs.  Air cooled VWs.  I
smelled it in my parent's old squareback.  I smell it in my bus.  It's not
altogether unpleasant, when I smell it it makes me keenly aware that I'm
driving my bus, one of my favorite things to do.

Anyway, hope all is well in your world
Eric
