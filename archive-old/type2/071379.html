 to lose the #3 retard unless you also lose the stock cooler. &gt;&gt;

whether you choose to do this or not is up to you, but  here is a little 
tidbit to consider.  vw made the stock cooler to help in the direction of 
airflow thru your fan shroud.  by taking the cooler out you leave an open 
spot.  open up a fan shroud and you will see directional vanes that correlate 
perfectly with the oil cooler in place.  remember.....ymmv
