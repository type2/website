Subject: Re: New Bus Nightmare

I'm sorry to hear about the problems you've had. This
is not the most encouraging way to begin a
relationship with your bus, either!

I'll spare you all of the &quot;could have-should have&quot;, as
they aren't going to help you at this point, and only
cause you more pain.

Legally, I *seriously* doubt you have a leg to stand
on, even *if* the seller deceived you (and I'm not
saying he did). The words &quot;as-is&quot; are pretty solid,
and tend to hold up in court.. Also, I consider myself
to be honest, but I put those same words on *every*
bill of sale; it's just plain smart.

I would wait for the mechanic's word and try to work
with the seller from there. This is not to say that
the mechanic's word is golden, either...honest
mechanics are getting to be increasingly rare. I
wouldn't expect too much from the seller, either
(though for that price, I would *hope* he'd come
through for at least some of the cost).

At this point, all you can do is to hope for the best.
If money's tight, you might consider buying a used
engine to get you by. If you go this route, I suggest
that you buy yourself both Muir's and Bentley's repair
manual manuals, a good hydraulic floor jack (the kind
with wheels), as well as some basic tools, and change
out the motor yourself. The reason I say this, is that
you *will* be doing it again (that's just part of
owning these babies;-), and there's no time like the
present to begin learning.

You're going to need those tools/manuals anyway, so
even if you don't do your own motor-pull, get them.
Knowledge is the most important tool you can have, and
those books will give you a lot.

Also, remember that there is an incredible wealth of
knowledge on the list. If you get in a bind and need
advice, information, parts, or even just
encouragement, you can find it here.

I wish you the best of luck. Let me (or the list) know
if there's anything we can do.
