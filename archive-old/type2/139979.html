&gt; researched it and found on the Autohaus Arizona website they say &quot;From
&gt; &gt;time to time, we hear the complaint that on some cars the SR15N (Bosch
&gt; &gt;new starter) cannot be installed properly due to an interference between
&gt; &gt;the starter solenoid and the heat exchanger/hot air box. This condition
&gt; &gt;seems especially prevalent on VW Type II and Bus/Transporter vehicles.&quot;
&gt; 
&gt; I've actually seen that quote before and found it an odd commentary. There's
&gt; also no mention of that in the archives.
&gt; 
&gt; Could this be a problem with the 67 bus? That model uses the same 12v
&gt; starter and the heat exchanger exits from the rear on the Type 1 engine. All
&gt; the previous starters were 6V so they would be a different part number.
&gt;

Hello Guys   I have install a bunch of these starters and havent had a single 
problem with it hitting anything .   later and have fun  Mark Dearing
