Subject: [T2] '79 Bus exhaust

I dismanteled my exhaust last night as I was preparing to get my engine
rebuilt. I took my catalytic converter off and it was only a shell. No guts.
I guess the PO put a fake on instead of shelling out the bucks for a new
cat. The hollow cat has still sufficient for me to pass my smog test 2 years
ago, but I gues I'll add a new cat to my shopping list.
