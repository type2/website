Subject: 77 rear brakes

I had a leaky cylinder in one my rear brakes requiring a brake-job.  I
replaced both of the drums, the pads, cylinders, and star adjusters,
followed by a front pad inspection and brake bleed.  My problem was that all
the &quot;detent&quot; springs for the star adjusters were missing.  I have been told
that I require new backing plates to fix this.  It almost appears that the
&quot;detent&quot; spring (a piece of spring steel to ride against the star-wheels)
should mount under the star-adjuster body.  Is there a kit of fix out there
so that I may immobilize the star adjusters so that they don't fall out of
adjustment (like they have been doing lately) preferably so I can get the
countable &quot;clicks&quot; when attempting correctly adjust them?

Thanks again!
