My bus came originally with a rear mounted spare, but it was removed by a
PO, presumably because it was a PITA unhitching it every time he needed to
check the oil or whatever.  I have seen one in action, the tire is mounted
to the bumper on a hinged frame that drops down to access the engine lid
(or tailgate).  Mounting the spare on the tailgate sounds good in theory,
but I'm not sure the hinges would stand up to the abuse without
reinforcement.  The tailgate is quite flimsy really.
If I could answer Claude's question at the same time, I don't think the
factory ever fitted the spare on the nose.  Surely it would need type
approval in that configuration and VW spent a lot of money around '72
redesigning the front for better crash protection.  If someone wants to
prove me wrong I would like to hear from them.
