Subject: Fire (was turn sig. switch)

Buddy of mine lost a nice autostick this way when the loser shop he took it too failed to clamp his fuel lines.

He tried to fight it with flour as he was parked in front of a restaurant supply store. Not successful.

Make sure your extinguisher is rated for B &amp; C
B = flammable liquids
c = live electrical equipment

&gt;Just a little note on fire extinguishers.
&gt;I was driving home on the Freeway and came upon a burning Beetle.
&gt;I pulled over and grabbed my fire extinguisher to help out.
&gt;The extinguisher was in the van when I got it and the origin was &gt;unknown.
&gt;Pulled the pin and squeezed the handle and nothing happened.
&gt;The sad beetle driver had the same results from his.
&gt;A third driver brought out his extinguisher and it too failed to &gt;work.
&gt;By the time the Highway patrol arrived the car was totaled.
