Peregrine's engine is back together, and running. The fan and the 
flywheel are staying put -- my prior error was not bothering to check 
endplay. Big mistake.

Now I am planning to drive the bus from San Diego to Tucson and I'm 
wondering about a couple of problems. The first is running too lean. I 
still haven't connected up the EGR circuit, as I am waiting to win the 
lottery before I spring for an EGR filter. Since I have a '76, couldn't I 
just short the leads to the microswitch so that the mixture is enriched 
as though at full throttle all the time?

Also, I am stuck with a 009 dizzy. I picked up a vac can distributor at 
the junk yard, but it doesn't pass the 'suck test'. Is the mechanical 
advance in stock distributors such that they advance the same as the 009 
when there is no vacuum advance? Could I drop the stock dizzy in the 
slot, time it statically to 16 degrees BTDC, and then replace the can 
when I find a good one and change the timing?

TIA, as always
