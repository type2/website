Joe G. asks if VW made/makes police vans.  They sure do/did.  Current ones
are in transition in German cities: some watercooled Vanagons, some Euro-
vans.  When I was stationed in Germany in 71-73, they were all breadloaves.
Interesting difference vs US is that they actually use the space.  In the
US if you need seven policemen, four to seven squad cars will show up.  In
Germany if you need seven policemen, one or maybe two VW vans will show
up.  Another interesting difference is firepower.  Police at international
airports and major rail hubs are as likely to carry submachine guns as
they are handguns.

Anyway the police vans are nothing special externally.  Lights on top, 
painted bumpers and hubcaps.  Some police Vanagons, and more of the Army
Vanagons, were Syncros, but not all in either case.  I didn't make it my
business to go up and gawp at a police van, so I don't know interior
details.

Among German toys, you are unlikely to find civilian VW vans.  Most of
them are decked out as commercial vans, police vans, airport runway &quot;follow
me&quot; vans, army vans, telco vans, etc.
