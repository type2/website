I have a buddy that was just forced to sell a pop up camper before he pcs'd 
to the states and the only reason was that it wasn't allowed anymore.  Heck 
this one had come from America I guess the question was when did the rule 
change.  So do your HOMEWORK and don't let anybody but the authoritative 
source give the final say so.
Peace Out
