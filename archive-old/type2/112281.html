&gt;I filled up my gas tank until the pump clicked off, which I now know not

&gt;expansion tube where the fuel line connects the two tubes and had
&gt;decided to leak! I had the fuel lines replaced last fall, but didn't
&gt;think about these.

FYI

I colored this diagram to illustrate the problem.
