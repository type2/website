As a fellow North Carolina Bus driver, I'm glad to report that NC leads the
nation in biodiesel filling stations. I hope that you'll be at everybus so
that we can go over your plans! I'm interested in the same thing.

time!  :-)

Subject: [T2] diesel engine, baywindow, or vanagon wanted


&gt; As many of you have read in my previous posts I want to run biodiesel or
&gt; veggie oil in a bay or vanagon.  So, I am looking for a diesel engine or a
&gt; bay or vanagon with a diesel engine already in it.  I would prefer to
trade
&gt; my 79 Westy (automatic), my 89 Volvo 240DL wagon, or some of my spare bus
&gt; engines for it.  Otherwise I can sell one to pay for it.  So let me know
&gt; what you have and what you want for it.  As well as what kind of condition
&gt; it is in and where you are located.
&gt; Thanks,
&gt; Kyle
