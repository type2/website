Subject: updated :  [T2] broken oil strainer bolt?

well, the shop took a look at it and said its not really worth patching, 
given the cost involved to repair it at this point and the shape of the 
motor otherwise, so it's off to be rebuilt.

I have been trying to consider all available options and im going with 
the AVP rebuilt longblock. im sending my core in tomorrow hopefully to 
get the ball rolling, then have my local shop swap it out for me.

now im just trying to factor in any other little things I should do 
'while im at it' and im thinking just a CHT guage to monitor this new 
motor, once installed and ready to rock and/or roll.
