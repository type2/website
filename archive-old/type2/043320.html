Well,

I get out whenever i stop and feel the dipstick, smell the engine,
generally commune with it.  I know its not like having bunches of gagues,
but those things tend to make me paranoid and i'd rather get my
maintenance up to date and trust my motor than spend my whole trip
fretting over things. If that means i have to rebuild a tad sooner, i
guess thats the price i pay for my enjoyment.  However, i feel my stop and
check method to work okay for me.  VW didnt install gagues so i figure if
one is mindful enough, one can drive without. I am being tempted to
install a tach, at least temporarily in my 61 to see where i am at what
speed. After that if i keep the same size tires i wont need it.

&gt; I think you do the list a disservice when you say you drive consistently at 
&gt; 70 when you're not.  There are people who will read that and think that they 
&gt; can actually do that.

they can, 70 mph is 4100 RPM, and thats safe given that it isnt taxing the
engine. I stated in my original post that i drive at 70 _indicated_ and
that my speedometer is a tad bit optimistic.

take care,

Steve
