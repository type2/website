Subject: Re: [T2] Engine Oil on Concrete Garage Floor - answered

Thanks.  Sounds like a reasonable idea.

I have to go out for some oil cooler seals or for a long 10mm wrench.

When I put the oil cooler on, I did not tighten it enough.  There is a BIG 
visible gap between the oil cooler seals and the oil cooler.  I can get at 
it from the side if I had a longer 10mm wrench.

I was able to get the box end of the wrench into a 5/8&quot; spark plug socket, 
and with the rubber spark plug socket insert pulled over the 10mm wrench, 
the 10mm wrench is a firm fit in the socket.

Next, I just add the 3/8&quot; extension to the socket and I get a long 10mm open 
end wrench!!

But, the spark plug socket  is 'just' a tad too fat and doesn't allow ne to 
get the needed 1/12 turn so I can flip the socket/wrench combo over and do 
another 1/12 turn.

Oh, well, the sun is shining in Virginia, and it is only 18 degrees F and I 
have the whole day off and a loving wife that feeds me fruit for breakfast 
(pineapple, mango, and sliced banana - nice color combination) and homemade 
bread and is really interested in what I am doing on the '72 VW.


Greg, thanks for the hint on the oil spill.  I will be able to pick up 
another gallon of paint thinner while I am out..  I was running short after 
all.

&gt;Hi Barry,
&gt;
&gt;I would suggest you rinse the area using varsol or paint thinner, then wash 
&gt;that off with dish detergent.
&gt;
&gt;Tide residue will be slippery just on its own.
&gt;
&gt;&lt;/Greg&gt;

&gt;&gt;OK, I have to clean up TWO oil spills.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;After I get the oil wiped up by paper towel, what COMMERCIAL PRODUCT do 
&gt;&gt;you recommend to clean up the final film of oil on the concrete.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Note: it is too cold outside to open the garage door and too cold outside 
&gt;&gt;to use the garden hose to spray out any residue.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;I have tried scrubbing one of the oil spills on my hands and knees with 
&gt;&gt;hot water and Tide , but there is still enough oil on this first spot to 
&gt;&gt;be too slippery to walk on.
