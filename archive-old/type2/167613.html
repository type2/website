&gt; I am very happy to announce that my bus is back on the road after a

dang, your hired, I'm still phutzing with mine, hope to have the &quot;new&quot;
engine in tommorroww....

&gt; Installing the engine took a bit longer than expected, but not that
&gt; much longer. The main hold-up was the lack of a pilot bearing in the
&gt; crank: the former host vehicle for this engine was an automatic, so
&gt; it never had a pilot bearing.

??? all my automatics have had pilot bearings, always wondered what they
were there for but they have never gotten in the way.

&gt; compartment was not at all hot inside. I am very happy with this
&gt; engine. The only remaining details are to replace the pushrod seals
&gt; and to permanently plug up the holes in the tin that are normally
&gt; used for the oil filler and heat riser pipes. For the trip home I
&gt; simply stuffed those holes with chunks of a spare foam engine seal.

spare engine foam has a million uses.

hope I'm posting good news tommorrow!!
