Subject: Re: [T2] Installing master cylinder

Glen,

Just finished doing it 2 nights ago.

My method(78):

I usually have the front end jacked up pretty high.

Install MC brake lines loosely.
Leave the 2 brake switches off.

Fill reservoir.  With switches and wrenches handy under the car, wait till 
brake fluid start comming out of the switch hole furthest away from the
front of the cylinder.

Insert switch and hand tighten till fluid quits coming out.
As you do this, fluid will start coming out of the brakeline next
closest to the front of the car....tighten it down and wait a few seconds
for the next &quot;leak&quot;....you get the idea...follow the leaks and tighten as 
you go.

Wipe down new mc and start bleeding.  When finished, go straight 
to the car wash and wash down everything and anything that might still
have brake fluid on it..

Works great for me.  


Cheers ,dave

&gt; I've replaced a leaky master cylinder on my '68.
&gt; Brand-new german part. Also replaced the hose to the
&gt; filler reservoir.
&gt; Next step is putting in the fluid, adjusting the
&gt; shoes, and bleeding. Argh.
&gt; (I've never had much luck fixing brakes and have gone
&gt; near insane bleeding brakes. I can only assume I
&gt; dented my karma in a previous life.)
&gt; 
&gt; To add to my anxiety, i came across a problem in the
&gt; Type II archives I never anticipated. Something about
&gt; not being able to push fluid from the reservoir into
&gt; the new master cyl. Somebody went as far as filling
&gt; the master up BEFORE putting it in!
&gt; 
&gt; Is the a common problem?! I do not want to take it out
&gt; again.
&gt; 
&gt; I was hoping to:
&gt; 1. Fill the reservoir
&gt; 2. Pump 50-60 times.
&gt; 3. Keep the reservoir filled while i went through the
&gt; bleeding process.
&gt; 4. Go crazy with frustration. Give up and take it too
&gt; a brake place.
&gt; 5. Drive to national parks in Utah this weekend.
&gt; 
&gt; Any help or warnings appreciated.
