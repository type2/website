what i found even more disturbing in reading the CARB info website is that
to get credit for removing a vehicle it need to be destroyed 100% and NO
parts can be resold or reused. This, right after thery state how they are
sensitive
about the concerns of collectors of vintage autos. They speak with for-ked
tounge.
