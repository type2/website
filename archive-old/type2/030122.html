&gt; &lt;&lt; Hello Fine List People:
&gt; 
&gt; We're all familiar with the spare tire mounted on the front of a bus, but has 
&gt; anyone mounted a spare on the back hatch, kind of SUV-style??  I figure you 
&gt; could use the same mounting kit as used for the front.  Also, the sheet metal 
&gt; may have to be reinforced, and maybe a lift-gate shock absorber-type of thing 
&gt; may need to be added to handle the extra weight of the tire.  Has anyone done 
&gt; this??

&gt; I have a question regarding the front mount....will that harm the bus?  Did 
&gt; the Spare ever come mounted up there from Factory?

Yes.  It will wear the paint, promoting corrosion, and also invite the
&quot;Park by Braille&quot; people to use it as a bumper.  I've never seen a
straight nose under a front-mounted spare.

My bus came with a spare tire mount laying underneath the back seat.
Thank goodness the PO was too busy to install it!

George
