Congrats:
I have a 78 Riviera and my name is Adam too, but in Portland Oregon.  Bus's
name is &quot;The Daddy Bus&quot; What color is yours?  Mine is Neptune Blue?  Photos

Can't help with the paint, but buy the books.  Green Bentley is the one you
want.  Also check out www.ratwell_dot_com for info.

Subject: [T2] New Bus!

After selling my 70 Westy named Armanda when I moved from Salt Lake to
Chicago 4 years ago, I have finally bought a new bus.  It's a 78 Riviera
that I intend to name &quot;Speedy Gonzales.&quot;
