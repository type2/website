Subject: Bay Window Replacement

I was looking at the seal on the bay window of my '73 Standard Bus this
morning.
It's pretty crusty and really should be replaced.
I am tentative about removal and replacement of that window though.
Has anyone done it. How difficult is it. What is the process. Does anyone
have access to instructions.
Also the driver's side ventilator seal needs replaced...same questions
there.
Thank you,
