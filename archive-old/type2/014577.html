&gt; Recently installed combination oil pressure/idiot light sending unit  in

&gt; frustrating! Still leaking!   I have 0 tolerance for leaks or rattles in/on

&gt; Read in the archives where Sean used some *Permatex* blue silicone on the
&gt; threads, and stopped the leak.  I am thinking of trying that, but,  was
&gt; wondering if it would be better to use a little *Fast Weld* epoxy putty on
&gt; the threads

I don't think that I would want to use anything as permanent as epoxy on
the threads.  Try some Hylomar.  It stays liquid, but is viscous enough to
seal the leaks.

I've never had good luck with teflon tape.  Better to use something that
flows..

Where is it leaking?  Mine was leaking at the casting line.  A slight crack 
appeared when the sender was screwed it.  I put a 2part epoxy weld on the 
casting line and the leak disappeared.  When I pull the engine the next time 
I will install a timesert to do the job right but the epoxy works for now.  On
ly needed a small amount, about the size of a match head on the case not the 
sender.
