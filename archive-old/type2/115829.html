&gt; BTW, I had to buy a plastic jerry can for the gas...it turns out that the
&gt; Air Resources folks here in CA have finally acted against the legions of
&gt; stranded motorists who constantly ruin our air by transferring minute
&gt; quantities of gas to and from jerry cans:  The cans available here now come
&gt; with an spring-loaded &quot;airtight&quot; filler nozzle contraption which doesn't
&gt; work with any of my cars (new or old), sprays gas everywhere, and has a flow
&gt; rate slightly lower than that of an amoeba urinating. If you might ever need
&gt; a gas can in our great state, be sure and import one from somewhere else.

I found that out the hard way also. The first can I bought from Kragen was
horribly complicated and expensive so I took it back unused.

The second one I bought from pepboys was in my price range and had a much
simpler design. It's actually really great for filling up a motorcycle gas
tank but that's all: the nozzle is short and there is no vent at the back
you can release so the gas flows quickly. The tip barely goes in the tank
and won't fit most openings as you said.

To make up for it they'll give you a funnel that fits the nozzle but it
doesn't screw on or have a rubber seal so on your first pour, gas goes
everywhere.

What I did was to cut the bottom off a 500ml water bottle and use it as a
funnel for a short term workaround.

Those contraptions end up spilling more gas then a regular gas can would.
