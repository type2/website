&gt; Isn't the big difference between the OEM version and the H-D versions
&gt; the welds? Seems like I bought one 15 yrs ago and the original version
&gt; had spot welds and the H-D version was fulled welded. If so, weld the
&gt; OEM version and you've got a H-D version.

The good ones also have thicker material in the forks.  Instead of a
little divot on the front (FIF) side of the &quot;hook&quot; there is a hole with
material ahead of it.  This stops the hooks from breaking off at the
&quot;divot&quot; when they wear.

You're right about the welding, though.  If I pull a throwout fork out and
it isn't completely welded I will weld it up.  However, if the hooks are
worn the fork is trash unless you can weld up the fork a bit and reshape
the ends.
