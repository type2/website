Bill, perhaps you could try those camping saws that lool like a cable
with little teeth along it, used to saw branches- figure  out a way to
get a string or wire started through the current hole, then pull through
the saw and pull it back and forth (this takes two people cooperating).
Also, those carborundum impregnated cables designed for hacksaws to cut
metal- beat the flat ends into a &quot;V&quot; to make them smaller in diameter.
You perhaps could try snaking in a stranded cable that will fit; then
check one end into a drill and &quot;fray&quot; out the other end so the frays
work on the rust as you pull out the cable while it's turning?
