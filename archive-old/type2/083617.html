Subject: Re: [T2] dizzy's and power

Roger,

As an experiment (and possible permanent mod), try this...  disconnect the
vacuum retard hose from the dist.  Cap the hose, but leave the nipple into
the vacuum can open.  Retime your bus to 7.5 BTDC at idle, vacuum advance
line attached. Try those hills again.

As I understand it, (from Karl (who will, I hope, correct me if I am
wrong)) at speed, the manifold vacuum and ported vacuum signals are near
equal and you get only mechanical advance. W/o the retard plugged in, you
should get some ported vacuum pulling advance and a bit more advance under
load.

&gt; So a few months back I replaced the 009 distributor on my bus (1700,
&gt; Weber Progressive) with a dual-vacuum advance distributor from a '79
&gt; California bus.  (The specs for the '79 Cali distributor are dang close
&gt; to that of the '74).  Timing witht the '79 Cali dist. is set at 5deg
&gt; ATDC w/hoses connected.  Around town the driveability of the bus
&gt; improved tenfold, with the bus taking off from a start much smoother.
&gt; Well around town it's been a welcome improvement, but I do a lot of
&gt; driving in the Cascades and I'll be danged if power in climbing hills is
&gt; much lower than when running with the 009.  Now there isn't a whole lot
&gt; of power there to begin with, but when you feel some of it gone, it is
&gt; sorely missed.
&gt;
&gt; So what gives?  Is this to be expected?  As stated earlier, this is a
&gt; '74 manual, Weber Progressive, running '79 Cali dist. w/electronic
&gt; ignition (&amp; the '79 coil).  All vacuum plumbing is new, correct, and
&gt; leak-free; vac can is leak-free.
&gt;
&gt; Thanks
&gt; -Roger
