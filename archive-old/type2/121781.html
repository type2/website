&gt;  I know Mercedes wheels have been discussed as options for late models

&gt; if there were perhaps any cheap &amp; easily available 15&quot; wheels
&gt; available for busses. 14&quot; tires are hard to find and really expensive
&gt; in the proper weight/load class, but there seem to be tons of 15&quot;
&gt; options. Just wondering if anybody knew of anything, or of any other
&gt; issues which would be a factor.

Go Westy! has several 15'' wheel packages, including a steel wheel that  
will take the stock hubcap.
