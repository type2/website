&gt; Hello, this is my very first question to the list.  I am planning a trip in 
&gt; August from Cleveland Ohio to southern New York.  Will my 70 Westy make it 
&gt; without any trouble with adjustments?  It's a rebuilt motor now, I did it two 
&gt; months ago.  It sounds great,  I have never taken it out of state before so I 
&gt; was just wondering. 

I once drove my 65 Westy from Colo to MD without turning the engine off,
nonstop...I routinely drive my current 78 from MD to New England and back,
usually in winter (I ski)
