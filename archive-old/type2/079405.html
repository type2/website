Subject: Vent flapper sealing - a solution

I posted a question recently about what type of material folks were using 
to replace the foam on the inside of the vent flapper doors found on the 
front of the van.

One respondent pointed me towards the little throw away foam paint brushes.

I went to buy some but instead found a 30 ft. roll of rubber/neoprene with 
an adhesive backing for $7.75 at Lowe's. This rubber is 2 inches by 1/8&quot; 
thick. I used a double layer. Nice job.

I could not cut this stuff with a utility knife - I had to use scissors.

Got plenty for other projects.

It is found in the pipe insulation department.

I do not presently remember the brand name but plan to do a hunt for the 
material name on the web tomorrow. There was no company identification 
information anywhere on the box.  Maybe they make other nice products.

Ciao!
