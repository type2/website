Subject: 68-75 trans in so cal?

Folks,
The following is from my local VW guru. His name is
Gentery and he's been working on VWs longer than many
of us have been alive.

Pmail him at popsbugshop_at_earthlink_dot_net if you know of
a good (or bad) trans for sale in so. cal. for a 68-75
bus.
This guy builds busses here in Ky, not buggies.

thanks,
clark
