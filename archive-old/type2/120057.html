Subject: Re: [T2] Air Fuel Mixture Logic

Re: will only idle with the timing over-advanced: I
had exactly the same condition once when I tried to
use hydraulic lifters on a solid lifter cam. I guess
the lash ramps on the cam were slightly opening the
valves too soon. I modified a 009 dist. to run lots of
initial advance and proper total advance and got it
running pretty good until I finally switched back to
solids and cured all my problems. This was on a 914
but thats just about the same as your engine.
