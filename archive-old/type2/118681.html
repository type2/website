Subject: Valve cover leaks

Hi All,
    The other day I did a routine valve adjustment on our 71 and can't
stop the drivers side valve cover from leaking.  There's no dings,
dents cracks or scratches on either the cover or the head.  Both
surfaces are clean and the cover isn't bent or twisted.  Despite using
new gasket I'm at a loss to get this to stop leaking.  I'm now
thinking that the bale, (or is it bail ? ), is the problem.  Has
anyone ever bent the bale so as to tighten it up?   If so how much and
where is best to make the bend ?
