Subject: Update on hard cold start in '79

Hi all,

Thanks for the help.  Switching the FI lead at the solenoid 
from the mystery 4th terminal to the second spade on term. 
50 seems to have done the trick.  We now have power at the 
cold start valve during cranking, and the bus fires up fast as 
ever!

I noticed Mike Benthin also had come across this mystery 
solenoid terminal.  I wonder what it was for and why ours quit 
sending voltage during cranking?
