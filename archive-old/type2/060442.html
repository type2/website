Subject: 17 Buses FS in Germany (mostly junk) (long)
Content-type: text/plain; charset=ISO-8859-1

Hi Volks,

this is a list of buses for sale.  Note that most of them would be 
considered junk, erm, ambitious projects ;-) by anyone.  But hey, 
they're cheap, and they have to be gone in two weeks' time no matter 
what.  The location is Salzgitter, Germany - not far from 
Braunschweig, Hildesheim, and Goslar; an hour's drive from either 
Wolfsburg or Hannover.

Anything from this list that isn't sold in two weeks will be junked.  
Actually, the process has already started, so I cannot guarantee that 
what you might be interested in is even still there at the time of 
posting this.  (In case you wondered, they aren't mine.)

List follows; where year isn't indicated, it's post-73.  Where 
condition isn't indicated, it's bad.  Make that worse.  Do not assume 
anything, ask for me to check it.  This includes things like, do 
engines turn, are all doors present, is there a frame to speak of, 
anything at all.  Note that 1600 engines in post-71 buses aren't 
conversions, as these are all Euro versions.

01. 69 Panel Van, light blue, one retrofit window opening opposite to 
sliding door, cond. reported okay, no engine, no tranny.

02. 71 Highroof Walkthrough Panel Van, dark red, ex-Post Office, two 
retrofit window openings in sliding door and opposite, no engine.

In fact, the following are all post-73.

03. Highroof Walkthrough Panel Van, red, ex-Post Office, retrofit 
windows like in a Kombi, sliding door missing, no engine.

04. Westfalia &quot;Berlin&quot;, blue, sleeper poptop, no interior, 1800 Type 
4 engine.

05. Westfalia &quot;Helsinki&quot;, taiga green, sleeper poptop, interior 
present, 2000 Type 4 engine (but not a good one).

06. Westfalia &quot;Mosaik&quot; (DIY kit resembling &quot;Berlin&quot; in normal Kombi), 
white with a taiga green stripe around, Syro sleeper poptop, interior 
present, no engine.

07. Bus, white, 2000 Type 4 engine, red interior not included in 
price

08. Double Door Walkthrough Panel Van, nato green, ex-jet fighter 
preheating van, used to have a jet engine in the cargo area and all 
kinds of gimmicks, now all interior missing, no engine (but used to 
be a 2000 Type 4)

09. Westfalia &quot;Berlin&quot;, blue metallic, sleeper poptop, interior 
partly present, 2000 Type 4 engine.

10. Bus, red, 2000 Type 4 engine, auto tranny.

11. Panel Van, yellow, no rear window, no window cuts, 1600 Type 1 
engine.

Prices for Listees:  Any Bus from above without an engine, DM 400 
firm.  Any Bus from above with engine, DM 500 firm.  Note that this 
is without any test runs or anything done by us - these are come and 
get it yourself prices.  Any work we'd have to do, prices rise.

The following Buses marked with (*) are exceptions: not sure if FS, 
might be more expensive too, ask if interested, we'd have to discuss 
their sale internally.  They probably also will not be junked quite 
so soon if at all, but if you're interested, you ought to act fast 
regardless - you never know.  :-)

12. Crew Cab, flat black, 1600 Type 1 engine (*)

13. Crew Cab, German Army camouflage coloured, cond. reported good, 
1600 Type 1 engine (*)

14. Kombi, light blue, no engine, no tranny (*)

Not a VW, but also a junk Transporter, if you're really interested we 
certainly can work something out as this is virtually worthless to us 
and we're not really interested in it at all:

15. Hanomag F20 low-bed pickup, white.

All vehicles are offered without German Fahrzeugbrief or TÜV 
inspection, as is, without any claim to completeness or 
functionality.  Many have windows missing, with the normal resulting 
damage to interior.  Many have interior parts missing.  Parts can be 
bought from us cheaply, but they're not included in the above price.  
The Buses are already junked as far as the German officials are 
concerned.  I'm not sure what problems that means for re-registration 
here or abroad.  Many have missing keys, and steering locks removed 
in order to be able to steer them regardless.  No, they weren't 
stolen, rather, well, hauled away as junk because their PO 
couldn't/didn't pay the rent of where they were located.  :-)

A Type 4 engine without a Bus, but removed by us, test run and at 
least running without fatal sounds etc., is also DM 500.  A Type 4 
engine that upon testing qualifies as a &quot;rebuildable core&quot;, DM 100.  
A tranny, I forgot to ask but not much over DM 100 if at all.  Type 1 
engines will be gone to the junker by the end of this week.  Vans 
that have a 1600 engine will very probably be junked accordingly.

ALL THOSE BUSES WILL BE JUNKED IN THE COMING TWO WEEKS.
Therefore, if you're interested, act fast.  There is no possibility 
for us to save one or two because you *might* be interested.  We can 
save one or two for a few weeks if you actually *bought* them and 
paid for them.

Other vans, not from the junk collection and not subject to the 
above:

16. German Red Cross Kombi, nine-seater, 1600 Type 1 engine, original 
Red Cross paint and inscriptions, DM 1,200.

17. 71 German Red Cross ex-Ambulance, not sure about interior, ask me 
to check it sometime, not sure about price but under DM 2,000 I 
think.

Both without TÜV but with Fahrzeugbrief, can be TÜVed at additional 
cost depending on work involved.  Looking quite good though.

Further &quot;stuff&quot; you might be interested in:

18. Westfalia wide bed from VW Wide Bed Pickup, original, one dent in 
sideboard, good condition otherwise, DM 300 obo

19. VW 2000 Type 4 engine, only 8,000 kilometres from new, runs 
excellently, can be test driven (still in Bus but Bus isn't FS), 
hydraulic lifters, electric fuel pump, first installed this year, DM 
2,200 firm

20. Rear engine hanger and cooling tin from 1600 Type 1 engines 
fitted in post-71 Loafs (Loaves?).  Several sets, varying condition.  
No idea about the price... make offer.

In need for other spares but engine and tranny, ask, we might just 
have it.  We also might need to know in order to pull it.  :-)

Ugh.  What a list.  ;-)  Sorry for the official tone at times, this 
isn't meant to sound as impersonal as it probably does.  Just wanted 
to keep it short &amp; crisp, and as unambiguous as possible.

P-mail me with any and all questions you may have.  (Including flames 
for bandwidth waste ;-)  Please use position number (1..20) when 
inquiring to simplify work for me.  P-mail will be checked until 1600 
GMT+1 today, possibly but not sure on the upcoming weekend, and from 
0900 GMT+1 Monday again.

Sorry for rambling &amp; happy Friday all!

Yours,
    Erik.
