Subject: Re: [T2] dropping valve seats in 1700 and later

&lt;Will anything besides monitoring heat prevent
this?&gt;

Yes. Park it. NOTHING on my bus has broken in several years now. Of course I haven't driven it for several years now either... &lt;grin!&gt; 

You need some instruments - temps for head and oil and pressures. Buy good stuff. 

Are you dropped valves because of aged parts or heat? Well you can rule out the heat with some instruments.
