&amp;gt;  My 73 thing with a 1600 DP and a 009 distributor seems to halter when I put my foot down on the accelerator when it is running slowly.
&amp;gt; I thought it could be a blocked accelerator pump, but I have read that the 009 distributor is not correct with a 1600DPm and I should be using a distributor with a vacuum advance &amp;amp; retard. Is this true?
&amp;gt; I will also post this in the thing forum on thesamba_dot_com

Quite true.  I replaced the 009 with a 205 SVDA and the hesitation went
away.  I didn't see any of the mileage claims that some folks talk about
for the SVDA, but the drivability makes it worth it.
