More with the fit of the Dansk product.  The Dansk boxes with the cheapo
spot welded flanges are quite a bit wider than the rolled and crimped OEM
flanges on '72-'78 boxes.  This can cause problems if things stack up against
you alignment wise around the oil filter, particularly on the '76-'78 as the U
tubes coming off the header pipes have the tendency to bend in more like
C's over time which points the exchangers closer together making the filter
clearance and muffler installation a SOB.  The '72-'74 or '79-'83 where the
exchanger bolts directly to the head doesn't have the problem as bad, plus
the Dansk Vanagon boxes have rolled and crimped seams oddly enough
(but aren't stainless like the OEM)   Anyway the guy who did the east coast
stuff mostly did a nice job, worst that was required was a bit of clearancing.
I think there were some gripes about pulled exhaust studs and stuff like that
from a few dealer installs.  Plus of course there were no fan housing to
exchanger gaskets (goop on RTV) and the '78 and '79 flapper valves were
the regular replacements without the ducting to the down tubes.  Regardless,
hard to kiss off $600 worth of free parts on a few minor gripes though.
