&gt; Hi all
&gt; Is there any satisfactory way to clean a Type 4 oil cooler? I have 3 or
&gt; 4 that look like there is just dirty oil inside but Bentley says
&gt;  to replace cooler if any filings etc are found in engine. Tthe cooler
&gt; is downstream of the filter so HAS to be cean but I have serious $
&gt; problems with a new cooler, especially when I have 3 - 4!
&gt; All help appreciated.
