Agreed !

But with a newly purchased bus I can have no assurance that the DM has been
applied to this vehicle by the PO !   This was my first journey in the bus -
I had not even got it home at this point.

Incidentally, I bought a notebook this lunchtime with the specific intention
of logging regular (and irregular) maintenance.

&gt; Can you say, &quot;Periodic Maintenance Inspection.&quot; Both the rotor and
&gt; the belt would have looked like s**t months before. If you had kept
&gt; notes on when those parts were last replaced/inspected you could
&gt; have anticipated a future potential problem  &lt;snip&gt;
