Subject: Major thanks wood interior help!

Thanks to the several folks who stepped up with the request for help
relating to the need for 5'x5'x.125&quot; wood for the interior of the on-going
'67 Resto from &quot;Heck.&quot; 
Following the tip from Bill Keating (willke_at_fullnet_dot_net), the wood was
located at: 
Peterman Lumber
15492 Slover 
Fontana, CA 92335
(909) 357-7730
(5'x5'x.125&quot; White Baltic Birch priced at $8.90 per sheet!)

Dang cheap as Home Depot wanted $23.00 +/- for 4'x8' and another local
source &lt;who flaked out on me&gt; wanted $20.00 per sheet for 5'x5' and never
got it to me. The flakey place did call late Friday to say that they could
get it in by this coming Wednesday as a special favor but the $8.90 was less
than their cost!

I knew that Jim Davis (syncrohead_at_aol_dot_com) and family were planning on
driving to Phoenix for business reasons. JD was nice enough to reply to my
whining (er, ah) request/imposition for help and transported the wood from
CA to PHX for me.

Thanks again to Bill and Jim for the help. This truly helped me BIGTIME! I
am still thrilled. =)

BTW: I also plan on installing the wood in the '83 Westy as a replacement
for the bad wall paper effect. &quot;OOOH Ellis goes Custom!&quot;
