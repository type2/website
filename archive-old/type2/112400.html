Subject: Re: [T2] 82 Vanagon Type IV Engine? Rebuild Problems

&lt;&lt; I have been told it is a type IV engine (it is the factory engine) but I 
have also been told it's a type II or atleast a type II vehicle with a type 
IV engine.  Maybe
 someone can clairify? &gt;&gt;

All &quot;buses&quot; are known as Type 2's. Within this body type, an early pre-1967 
bus is know as a T1; a 68 - 79 bus is a T2; a 80 - up vanagon is a T3; a 
eurovan is a T4.

The early US T3 &quot;Vanagon&quot; had 2 engine styles; either an aircooled engine 
that originally came in the Type 4 &quot;411&quot; or an inline 4 cylinder watercooled 
diesel engine originally found in the A1 &quot;Rabbit&quot;..

I personally would pull the engine.  Its much easier to work on; you are more 
likely to identify all problems do a more thourough, careful job of the 
replacement.
