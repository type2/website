Subject: Re: [T2] Newbie hitting walls...

&gt;  Hey peter     This is a lot of Assuming isn't it  LOL   You know what they
&gt; say about assuming don't you.....  Makes an ASS out of U and ME   :)    You
&gt; stay on this list long enough you will learn never to assume anything
later
&gt;  Mark dearing

Absolutely.  That's why I pointed it out.  I took a look through the
post on the Samba and didn't notice anywhere that hydraulic valves
were confirmed, just that they were assumed because it appears to be a
stock 78.
