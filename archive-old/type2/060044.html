Sounds just like the problem I had in my '79.

Turned out the clutch was occasionally sticking.  With mine, if I put down
the clutch and hit the gas, you could feel the clutch plate popping free,
and then you could easily shift into whatever gear you need.  If you just
put the clutch pedal down, the clutch didn't disengage like it should have,
and pulling the shifter out of gear (with the clutch pedal down) just put
you into neutral.  So, when you tried to put the shifter back into 1st or
2nd gear, it wouldn't let you.  Putting it into 3rd or 4th was more doable,
perhaps because the engine speed was matched better to these gears (?). 

With the engine turned off, either the clutch would disengage itself
eventually, or perhaps since the gears aren't moving, popping into gear
(unclutched) would be more doable.

Anyway, a new clutch solved my problems, and is much cheaper than a tranny
rebuild - just needed one on my wife's f#rd last week -- no christmas
presents for the kids this year!  :{   

Good luck!
