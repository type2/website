Hi Michael,
the type II museum is located in Salzgitter-Gebhardshagen, at the old mine
Haverlahwiese. It's about 30 mls from Wolfsburg, 40 mls s-east of Hannover.
It's always open on Sundays (maybee also  Sat's).
They have about 20 Bays there, also some splits and at least one aircooled
vanagon westy. They are running it on enthusiasm, private money only.
They try to tell Bus-stories about every single car around  there, the
condition is mainly &quot;as they were on the road&quot;.
When you come over for a visit -  it's easy to combine it with a visit of
the AutoMuseum Wolfsburg, the official Factory-Museum.
We've been to both museums two weeks ago to the &quot;50 years official
press-announcement of the Bus party&quot; at Nov. 12th and it's been nice again.

Best wishes from Braunschweig (also very close),
please xcuse terrible english,

Michael Meier

58 split
77 westy

Can anyone give me information on it, and where it is located. I remember
the curator posts to the list occasionally, but haven't seen him in a while.
