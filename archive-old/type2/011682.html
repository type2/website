Subject: re: Storing spare keys
To: type2_at_type2_dot_com

I have to agree with some listees, in that identifying
 hiding sites for spare keys defeats the purpose of
the discussion.  Having said that,  I'll tell you
where I keep my spare keys.  One is in my wife's
purse, one is in my son's pocket (when he is with us),
and one is at home in a drawer with spares for all the
other keys in my life.  If I  travel somewhere by
myself, I also carry a spare in my  wallet, and maybe
another in my luggage.
