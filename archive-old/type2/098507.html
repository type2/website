Subject: Re: [T2] How do the retractable belts work in an accident??

&gt; So I installed the 3 point retracting belts into my 70 bug so my daughter

Some belts work on the rate at which the belt is pulled out, others (like
stock VW/Audi self-adjusting belts) work with a pendulum inside the
retractor reel.

Yours sound fine.  They're really quite foolproof.
