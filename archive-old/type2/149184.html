&gt;I have never seen one of those, it looks like the thermocouple is composed of two mixed wires from a different metal.

Yes.

&gt;- can I cut it myself and sold the wire on the ring directly like if it was a regular wire ?

Yes. I would simply crimp the terminal to the wire.

&gt;- Is anyone know where to buy a 14mm ring out there, I could find too much info on the web.

Hard to locate. I can sell you one if you can't find any. I have or or two left.

&gt;I was thinking to buy a sending unit to VDO (because the ring size is correct) and extend the thermocouple wire all the way to the guage.
&gt;- Again same type of questions , since you have two different metal in the wire , is it possible to reattach two thermocouple wires.

That probably will work but I haven't tried it. k-type termocouple wire which is what the DD gauge uses is color coded red/yellow according to a standard. What color is the VDO harness?

The voltage produced by the wire is very small in the mV range. If you mix and match k-type and j-type you upset the reading. Seebeck's law governs thermocouples:

You can spice in wire as long as both ends of the wire are at the same temperature...
