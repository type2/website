I've seen original, heavy OEM German CV boots that've lasted 15 years or more
on the axles. It seems that the boots made in India, Israel, Brazil or
wherever don't last nearly as long. However, one VW shop owner told me that
you've got to use the cheap boots while they're fresh and haven't been sitting
around on the shelf for a long time, or they'll crack and split shortly after
they've been installed. It seems also that constant contact with the moly
grease keeps the boots from cracking.

Try to locate some OEM German boots. Cleaning and repacking CV joints and
replacing CV boots is a messy job I'd rather not do anymore often than every
7-10 years or so.

I had all 4 cv boots replaced at the begining of
August. By mid October both boots on the drivers side
were torn and I replaced them myself. Like a moron I
allowed the CV to come apart. It was fun. Now the
inner boot on the passenger side is torn. Is it common
for 3 of 4 boots to fail in 2 to 6 months? Should I
replace the other one that was replaced in August
while I'm at it? I don't really

Yeah, replace the last one...obviously there was a
quality or installation problem all around.
