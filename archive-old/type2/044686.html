If you can't screw them out, you can drill the heads out pretty easily.
Use a bit just a bit smaller than the outside diameter of the the bolts.
Drill just deep enough to detach the head.  With the head(s) detached. the
rotor should slip off.  You can then use Vise-grips to remove the remains
of the bolts.
