Except, of course, for that sliding region between the brake shoe and
drum!  Get some there and it can ruin your whole day!  Take care where
the grease might get onto the shoes.

Remember that the brake shoes get hot, and they get shaken around a
lot over bumps and such.  Use only thick grease (I like Bosch
distributor point grease) that won't melt and get flung about.

yes- do be careful not to get grease on the shoe linings or on the surface of
the drum where the shoes meet.    What I was talking about was the bit where
the shoe goes into the brake star bolt.  A little smear of grease there would
prevent the shoe from getting stuck to the bolt - it happens.   This part of
your bus does not rotate and will not spin the grease around.     But I do not
mean blopping a big dripping blob of grease there.  Sorry to have not been
more clear.   

Grease is your bus' friend and there are many moving parts on it which like
lubrication, especially as the splitties are more than 30 years old and have
rarely had all the lubrication done regularly.   The adjusting stars should
not be hard to turn, but should move very easily.    I have only seen adjusted
brakes on 1 (one) VW which had had the stars previously lubricated, unles it
was one I had previously done the brakes on.    I was very impressed with that
one bus, which belonged to a guy who had been very concientious about having
it worked on, and had had many repairs done to it, making a very nice bus out
of some old POS he had found.  Deck lid linges, as many have seen, wear out.
As do door hinges.   If they had been oiled every 1200 miles as recommended by
VW, this would not have happened.
