&gt;&gt; A straight weight synthetic had actually been on wish lists for a 
&gt;&gt; while.  About two years ago there was a discussion at one of the 
&gt;&gt; meetings i attended on new merchandise for the flaps iworked at that 
&gt;&gt; time.  The vendor rep from mobile stated that strange as seemed that 
&gt;&gt; there actually were some difficulties in blending a straight weight in 
&gt;&gt; synthetics.  Looks like the hurdle has been beaten.
&gt;
&gt; I wish it were true.  I couldn't find any reference to a 
&gt; straight-weight synthetic on Mobil's web site, so I called them up and 
&gt; asked.  The person I talked to said he knew nothing about a straight 
&gt; 30-weight oil.  Here are the only weights listed on www.mobil1_dot_com:
&gt;
&gt; 0W-40
&gt; 0W-30
&gt; 5W-30
&gt; 10W-30
&gt; 15W-50
&gt;
&gt; He did say they were working on a 5W-20 oil.
