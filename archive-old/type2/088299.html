Subject: Re: [T2] Old brake fluid

[...]

&gt; Bentley says to replace the brake fluid every two years.  Is this current
&gt; advice?

Yes, this is up-to-date advice. Mercedes to this day recommends changing it
every two years, preferably in the spring.

&gt; Also, what &quot;ages&quot; brake fluid and makes it less effective/problematic?

Brake fluid is hygroscopic. This means it absorbs moisture. It pulls it right
out of the air! The water settles into the lowest point: the wheel cylinders.
This causes 2 problems. One is rust pits in the cylinder and the seals start
leaking. The other is worse, water boils at 212F. Dot 4+ [MB brake fluid]
boils at 500F. Using your brakes going down a mountain with water in the fluid
will cause NO brakes!
