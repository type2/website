Subject: Re: [T2] wheels and tires in the time of cholera.

This is what I like about you, Ron. =D

The tire conundrum resolves itself to me in this way: There is a wider
vareity of LT tires available for the larger rim sizes. Especially now
that putting street tires on SUVs is so popular. ;-) If you &quot;Plus 1&quot;
or &quot;Plus 2&quot; your wheel/tire combos, you can maintain the same total
tire diameter but get more selection in tires.

Granted a shorter sidewall is more likely to remain stiff under load,
but I wouldn't want to do any mountain driving or emergency swerving
with them.
