Subject: Re: [T2] Slight Back Fire/Another Dizzy Question

Thank You Karl, yes it is a 205E Dizzy

As a few of the Full Moonies know I swore I would never touch the timing
again after my last fiasco, I think I need to remember what happened the
last time with the 009 and when I was so proud to tell everyone I had put in
new points and gapped them at .006, in unison 4 guys said ......006 like the
picante commercial and New Your City!!!!!

However if I follow your advice I think I can get it timed close enough to
get a &quot;Real&quot; Mechanic to look at it, then next time I see Derrick &quot;from
Charleston&quot; I'll see if he can work his magic again.

Have a good week and Thank you Again!

Meredith

&gt; [...]
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; &gt; I rebuilt a Bosch 205A for my 72 bus
&gt;
&gt; A 205A??   What did that one fit?  The correct one is a 021 905 205E
&gt;
&gt; &gt; out of two I had, new points gaped at
&gt; &gt; .016, cap and rotor, used a condenser that was on one because I could
not
&gt; &gt; find one to match up locally, I have a 32/36 DFAV and installed the
advance
&gt; &gt; vacume &quot;front of can&quot; to a vacume port on the rear &quot;facing me&quot; of the
carb,
&gt; &gt; for the retard side I teed off the carb manifold that supply's the
Vacume
&gt; &gt; Brake Assist, installed and static timed it and went to fire it up, Ye
Ha it
&gt; &gt; started right up, then I timed it to 7.5 BTDC
&gt;
&gt; Whoa!   WAY TOO MUCH initial timing at idle. If you have vacuum at idle to
the
&gt; retard side, the correct timing at idle is 5 AFTER. If you disconnect the
retard
&gt; vauum, it should go to 5 to 10 BEFORE.
&gt;
&gt; &gt;and 32 Advance ATDC,
&gt;
&gt; No..... you cannot have 32 degrees Advance and have it go ATDC. No way, no
how.
&gt; When you ADVANCE timing you are leading the spark BEFORE top dead center.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; &gt;however
&gt; &gt; when I slowly give it gas I get a slight hesitation and some slight back
&gt; &gt; fire, but once it revs up it seams to run fine as I check my advance
timing,
&gt;
&gt; IF you have manifold vacuum at idle going to the retard side and intial
timing
&gt; set at 5 AFTER [NOT static timing] then as soon as you open the throttle,
&gt; manifold vacuum will drop and you will get an instant 11 to 15 degrees of
&gt; advance.
&gt; As soon as you hit about 2000 rpms, you get 13 - 16 degrees centrifugal
advance
&gt; and 8 - 12 degrees vacuum advance if you reached 8'' of vacuum on the
advance
&gt; side.
&gt; Do you have ported vacuum going to the advance side? [the nipple pointing
away
&gt; from the dist.]
&gt; Ported vacuum is no vacuum at idle and it appears after you open the
throttle.
&gt; Set your timing at 5 after AT IDLE. Then disconnect the retard hose.Read
the
&gt; timing now. Should be around 8 before. Bring the engine speed up to around
3600
&gt; and read the timing. It should be around 35 to 38 degrees + the initial of
8 so
&gt; it should be off the scale. The scale ends at 40, correct?
&gt; Forget that 'max total advance of 30-32', this is NOT a type1 engine. It
is a
&gt; type4, it is designed to run with this much timing.
&gt; Go to the 68-79 Bentley, section 5, page 75 and look up the correct
distributor
&gt; and do the math.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; &gt; I'm sorta afraid to take it on the road while it is doing this for a
test
&gt; &gt; drive, can any see something I missed or can offer suggestions on what
to
&gt; &gt; try.
