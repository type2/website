Subject: must be jelly (front end)

coz jam don't shake like that.

OK - took a recent 1600 mile trip in the 70bus, and it wandered all over
the road, was tough to handle in winds, etc.
It should NOT have, as I have replaced:
all ball joints
all tierod ends and tierods
drop lever
steering dampner
shocks
swinglever pin and bushing
tires were replaced w/ new LT reinforced sidewalls (Bridgestone 603s)
new steering box
front end alignment at a long-time VW shop.

WHAT THE HECK ELSE can I fix? It really has me baffled... last options seem
to be front torsion arm needle bearings (which supposedly NVER go bad if
kept greased) and the rubber bushings in the rear trailing arm mounts.

suggestions appreciated.

other than that, trip was great!!
