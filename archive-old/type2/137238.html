Subject: Re: [T2] moving the battery in a Westy Vanagon?

Hi Volks!

&gt; What you need to remember is this: when starting your
&gt; bus, power from the battery goes to the Ignition
&gt; switch up front FIRST, and then goes to the starter
&gt; solenoid, so moving the battery closer to the starter
&gt; will have no positive effect on your starting
&gt; problems.

Unless he also adds a relay in the starter circuit that's
activated by the current from the ignition switch, and
routes the current from the battery directly to the starter.
My 1966, 6 Volt Bug had this.  Worked like a charm (until 
the relay died, which caused a funny little expedition 
through the car's electrical system because I had no idea
the relay was there and thus checked everything else ...).

Airhowlingly yours,
