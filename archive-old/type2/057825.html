Subject: Oil Pressure sender install

I installed my oil pressure sender on my 73 bus (type IV engine) today.
Getting the oil dummy-light sender out was looking ugly until I
discovered I had a 15/16 socket in an old tool box - perfect fit (metric
equivalent = 24???).

Anyway, installed the VDO extension hose and mounted the sender to the
case.  Took me about 5 minutes to figure out the 'G' marking on the
sender went to the dummy light and the 'WK' terminal was for the gauge.
Why don't they document that??

I haven't run wires to my dash for my gauge yet, but when I hooked the
gauge up at the back it looks like I have about 20 psi at idle (warm,
but not hot engine - 900 rpm) and it increases to about 38 when I
increase the revs to around 2500 (sitting still - no load on engine) -
this is with fresh 20-w50 oil.  Does this sound about right?  I hope so
since I'm in the final prep stages for my 2500 mile, 25th
birthday-for-my-bus trip to Jerome!
