Subject: Popping out of first

Howdy!  I'm David Bradley in Atlanta.  Just bought a '72 Transporter; just
joined the list.  I'm trying to figure out why it's begun popping out of
first gear whenever any serious load is put on it.  I can start off just
fine, but as soon as the RPMs build, pop goes the weasel!  Any suggestions
as to what's most likely and where to start looking?  I'd appreciate any
advice.

Thanks,
David
