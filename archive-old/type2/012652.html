Subject: Scored a Hoover Bit!

Hi All,

I went to the junkyard today and picked up a beautiful looking
&quot;Hoover Bit&quot;.  Zero rust and not bent at all.  It was almost like
finding the Holy Grail.  Now, I made one after following D. 
Mueller's excellent article on Van Ness's page so I don't really
need it but it was exciting to find just the same!  I think I'll
hang it from the Westy's rear view mirrior. :) 

On the same car(73 bug) I picked up the blower housing, flaps w/
connecting rod, exit ducting for a doghouse set up AND the intake
manifold from (i think) a 71 bus.  It has the 1/2&quot; outlet for the
vac booster tube and a 211 part number.  I forgot my big socket
so I couldn't get the fan. :(

There was also a Ghia with an engine case that said &quot;Hencho en 
Mexico&quot; in the rear right under the distributor.  Is this one of
those mexibeetle engines?  It was a goldish(cosmoline?) color and
turned easily.  Heads 'looked' ok too.  Thought about picking it
up.  Maybe for that 1776.........................

Take care.

Derek
70 Westy
