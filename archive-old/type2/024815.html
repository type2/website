&gt; elcom back All!
&gt;  I have been dying to ask this question for 3 days.  I am looking at buying 
a 
&gt; starter for my 66 bus with 71 engine from a guy online.  He says it is 
&gt; compatible for ALL AIR-COOLED VW's WITH A 12 VOLTT SYSTEM.  Is this 
possible, 
&gt; or is the guy a few cabinets short of a complete Westy interior?!?!  
Looking 
&gt; through dealer catalogs, I see that there are many more than one model  12 
&gt; volt starter.  The price is right, but if it may not work, I don't want to 
&gt; waste my bread.
&gt;  
&gt;  

I think the pancake motors, or at least the 2L motors in the late bays used a 
more heavy duty starter, but I am not sure.   There are a number of 
variations on the upright 1600 type 12V starter, some start with 311 or 113 
on the part number.  The one I have in the 61 is real short, I was told that 
if it was longer the reserve tap stuff would hit the starter (?) .  But yes 
there is wide interchangability .  often when I get a starter (or some other 
bits) I say it is for a 69 beetle, as that makes the parts people have an 
easier time looking things up.

Shucks/Kragen's/Checker's also does the lifetime warranty starter deal.  I 
have one in my bug and one in my camper.
