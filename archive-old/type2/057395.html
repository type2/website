   Whoa -- hold on there. Having gone the other route, putting an '81 in
a '73, I can tell you that there isn't all that much difference. The
front and back tin and the side pieces might have to change, but I doubt
the fanhousing, alternator, and especially the heater boexes or exhaust
need changing. Nor does the oil fill tube or dipstick. 
    Obviously the rear motor mount/bearer bar has to change, but that's
not a problem since it's just a straight bolt up.

    I have no clue why you would think that not sealing the engine
compartment would have anything whatsoever to do with engine life. That
hasn't anything to do with cooling, you know? More dust in the engine
might require more frequent air filter changes I suppose, but that's
about all. In fact, if anything, the engine would run cooler.
