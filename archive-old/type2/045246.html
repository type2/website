Subject: RE: [T2] late model bus oil plate = 914  w/ sender hole?

Victor-
How very weird, I'm literally working on both motors right now in my garage,
Finishing a rebuild of a stock 73 2.0 for the 914 and replacing the rear
main seal for the bus (72 stock Westy) and rebuilding the stock Carbs.  The
Bus motor is pulled and sitting on the floor while the 914 is on a stand.
Sure looks to me like they are the same.  While the carb bodies are soaking
I turned around and was adjusting the valves on the 914.
The Bus motor is sitting on a creeper so I can't really tilt it up too far
to get a really good look but I can tell you the cases seem to have come
from almost the same mold.

73 914 2.0
72 Westy
68 Soft back Targa 912 (euro)
89 F-150 4x4 SC

&gt;
&gt;
&gt; can anyone confirm or refute this:
&gt;
&gt; i have heard that the oil plate on the bottom of a porsche 914 engine will
&gt; fit the later model air cooled bus engines (you know, that plate on the
&gt; bottom with the little bump and 2 bolts), that the 914 engines
&gt; came with oil
&gt; temp senders factory installed, and that the sender hole is the
&gt; same size as
&gt; the vdo sender for their oil temp gauge (9/16&quot; dia).
&gt;
&gt; (it would be great to prebake one of these, a la julia child, for an
&gt; installation next oil change. no fuss, no mess.)
&gt;
&gt; thanks,
&gt; victor
