&gt; I'm hoping someone can help, i was traveling to a local VW event yesterday
&gt; when i sudenly heard a noise like a piece of cardboard in the wheel of a
&gt; bike, this quickly turned into a loud thumping noise.  I pulled to the side
&gt; of the road to find the driveshaft had come away from the wheel side.  On
&gt; closer inspection i found that one of the bolts had completly sheered off,
&gt; My first problem is trying to remove the the sheered bolt.

you might find the bolt is actually not in there very tight now that
the head of the bolt is sheared off. sometimes those things are not
that tight after failure of this sort. if it is I'd try to soak it in
a penetrating oil first and see if it's possible to grab what's left
with vice-grips.

&gt; The second and what i am posting this e-mail about is what can
&gt; possibly have caused these?  Is it just possible i have clipped a
&gt; kerp sheering one bolt and over time the rest have worked free, or
&gt; is it likely to be something much more serious?

I don't think this would be the problem. the shaft only transfers
power to the wheels, while the wheel assembly is held by the torsion
plates. IIRC there are several different combinations of
bolt/retainers out there for the CV joins. Some have bend up tabs.
Some (like the ones on mine) have lock washers. You might have just
been unlucky this time.
