TDC is not at the top of the case on the 1700.  According to the scale on my 72,
TDC is approximately 24 degrees to the left of the top of the case.  (about 2
1/4 inches)

&gt;      i don't have a scale on my shroud (or marks for that matter).  is
&gt; TDC generally at the top of the case ( that split or weld mark or whatever)?
