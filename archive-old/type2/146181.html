Subject: Re: [T2] burning bus on COPS

In regards to the post  about smelling fuel coming from the vent tube in
the wheel well, don't plug it ! Assuming this is an early bay '68-'71
we're talking about ? With the small drain hole just below the gas cap?
Crude as it may seem, that funnel /tube thing is how gas sloshing out
the gas cap was dealt with back then. It helps if you don't fill up all
the way to the top.  If the tube is working properly that is the only
place you should smell it. What you need to check is that the tube
hasn't rusted through in the engine compartment allowing gas to flow
down around the battery tray. Is there a strong smell in the engine
compartment as well? Now if this is a later bay, with the exposed gas
cap. You can have a small tear in the rubber elbow directly behind the
opening which will allow gas to flow where it shouldn't. Or... there are
also several small sections of rubber hose around the top of the gas
tank and in the fresh air intakes  connecting the metal tubes of the
smog control . They never get changed, and when they leak, you have gas
sloshing around the engine compartment...major fire risk!!! Good things
to check, anyhow, cheap fix...before the fire that is!  (don't ask me
how I know)   Timo
