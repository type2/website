Subject: Heater cable needed

Hello all,

I am looking for a heater cable for my '79 Bus.  This cable runs from the
left side red lever on the dash down under the van to the heat distribution
box under the floor, below the walk through.  This cable either directs all
heat to the front vents or allows some to be channeled to the walk-through
vent and to the rear vent.

My cable is bent at the red lever :-(

If anyone's got one they don't want, let me know your price.  I checked with
the VW dealer today, they told me it's NLA.
