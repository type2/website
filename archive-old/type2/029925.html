I bought a IRS bus transaxle from Rancho about 3 years ago.  It ran about 
2 months before it started popping out of 4th.

Now, in Rancho's defense I didn't send it back to them, since I figured
that I had just experienced another &quot;GEX-style rip-off&quot; and my blood
pressure didn't need raising.  I just had another trans rebuilt (by that
infamous internet guy) and life went on.

Since then, I have been told that Rancho bends over backward to back up
their work and that I should have sent my failed tranny back.  I doubt
that they'd be too happy to see it at this late date, though!

Live and learn,

George Lyle
