Subject: Re: [T2] E10

Ken Dunn opined:
&gt;  There are
&gt;mixed reports of ethanol corrosion of certain rubbers and aluminum.

	Today on Radio NZ, copper is also being claimed as allegedly 
corroded by E10.  I'm sceptical.


&gt;However, as with most petrol blends the point for concern seems to
&gt;start around 20% (E20 and up).

	I think you'll find that, depending on T and trace water, 
EtOH does not form a single phase with petrol above c. E18.  Nobody 
suggests trying to distribute a two-phase mixture.  So in practice 
there is no such thing as, say, E30.
	Then when you get to E85 you have once again a single phase. 
The experts in U of Canterbury who researched ethanol &amp; methanol 
admixtures with petrol 3 decades ago (mainly on a Mini) liked the 
solutions such as E90 &amp; M90.
	E100 is of course widespread in Brazil, and VW made T2 there 
tuned to use it.  On the immortal J.A.P. 500cc single burning E100, 
16:1 compression was normal.  These alcohols are cool fuels!
	M100, with unknown nitromethane possibly mixed in, was of 
course Munro's 200 mph fuel.
	All these high-alcohol fuels need much bigger jets; I don't 
know what would be needed to make FI work OK with them, but it 
wouldn't be trivial.  Also they get worse mpg; but that's somewhat 
misleading because their densities are lower than that of petrol so 
it would be fairer to quote mile per kg.


&gt;  Personally, I'd run E10 proudly,
&gt;without fear, if I could find it.

	I know of few criticisms of E10.  But my main purpose in 
starting this thread was that I would like to hear from anyone who 
has experience of fuel system damage in T2 (esp carb types) from E10, 
and what are safe tubing, gaskets etc.
