Subject: Re: [T2] Re: Free '74 Camper in Philadelphia


&gt;In my opinion the blue &amp; green plaid which was only offered in the Yellow 
&gt;or
&gt;White Westy in '74 &amp; '75 is the nicest interior and layout offered in any
&gt;bay window Westy.

Is the 74 the first year that sleeps four people (the pop top is in the back 
instead of the front)? If so 74 would be the camper for me, I am much more 
comfortable working with carbs. Anybody know how much rust the body has? I 
would guess if the axle is rusted out the body probably isn't that great.
