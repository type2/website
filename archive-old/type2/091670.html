Subject: RE: [T2] Don't scrap your Buses!

I understand and I don't mean any offense to Bustedbus, but how far (
distance wise ) can one yard go to salvage a bus? How far can a enthusiast
drive to get larger parts such as intact shells etc. I think my limit right
now is about a state and a half. Shipping works sometimes, but sometimes
that becomes cost prohibitive. Maybe the solution is a Bustedbus franchise
:-)
