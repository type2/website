Subject: Re: [T2] vanagon seats into 77 Westie??

Hi COurtney,

It is that easy.

The only down side is that the vanagon seats are about an inch taller than the
baywindow seats. It's only a problem if you have a very long torso or very
short legs. I have captain's chairs from a 1987 vanagon in my westfakia and
they are wonderful.

Happy trails,

&gt; Vanagon seats into it?
