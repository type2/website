Subject: After brake fluid flush....questions

78 2.0 FI 
 
The bus was pulling to the right sometimes when the brakes were put  on.
 
I had a sticking caliper and pulled it all apart and rebuilt it, put it  back 
in and it's great.
 
I totally flushed the brake fluid out and bled the brakes per Bentley and  
the great write up on type2_dot_com.
 
The funny thing about the bleeding is that when I was under the bus,  my 
father was telling me that when I would say &quot;down&quot; he would only be able  to push 
the brake pedal down 60% or so of the way down on both rear  brakes.  The 
front right was better, closer to 80%, and the front left was  the best, just 
about all the way down.
 
After doing this process, the brakes are soft, compared to our 77  Westy.  I 
can pump them up and they work, but the initial action is not up  to the same 
par as the 77.
 
Sooooooooooooo
 
I suspect my flex brake hoses.  I have never changed them on the bus,  and 
that's my best guess, so I am hoping someone will confirm that these  symptoms 
are in line with my diagnosis, or hoping that someone will point  me in the 
proper direction.
 
Thanks!
 
~Jeremy
