I have been watching this thread, and it brings to
mind that some people are saying there is NO
difference between hydraulic and solid camshafts, or
if there is, it's minimal and not really an issue?
I'm thinking of switching to hydraulics as well, but
NOT if it entails splitting the case for a new cam.
Anyone who KNOWS, or has done this, care to comment?
Is your van running fine with a solid cam, and
hydraulic lifters? What about the rocker arms, are
they the same?

Yes, I and my daughter have over 400,000 miles on two
different 77 Westies with the original solid cams and
good used VW hydraulic lifters, steel pushrods, and
the spacers between the rockers.

Trouble free and it works fine. NO power difference.
