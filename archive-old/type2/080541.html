Add a fine mesh brass screen and some smouldering
vegetable material and i think you've got it  !
( Be sure to check local ordinances first -YMMV 8^)
Personally, i like the used vegetable oil fuel supply from
french fryers and fast-food restaurants. Where are those guys ?

&gt;Hello all    Have you ever notice how a car runs better when it's raining.
&gt;The water injection  will increase the mileage and power of an engine. It is
&gt;very easy to do also just make a hooka pipe and put a air stone from an fish
&gt;tank on the bottom intake pipe. this causes the water to vaporize plug this
&gt;to the bottom of the intake,using a valve to regulate the flow. The big
&gt;problem is upkeep putting water in the hooka tank.
