Content-Disposition: inline

Yesterday, I had asked the list regarding a MAJOR (waterfall like) fuel leak on the left side of the engine, when I filled the tank, but what is strange about this whole thing is that the fuel leak STOPPED completely after about 5 minutes, and it has yet to leak again?? Maybe if I fill the tank again?? What gives??
