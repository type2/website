Subject: Is this engine worth saving?

Hello, all.

I've just got around to thinking about the 1600DP I pulled from my bus a few
years ago, and thought it would be kind of fun to start it up, and have a go at
converting it to a compressor (1&amp;2 firing, 3&amp;4 pumping) until the time comes to
rebuild it to go in the bus. I pulled the engine because of excessive crank end
float, and the fact that I couldn't get a crank oil seal to last more than a few
weeks. The flywheel had been swapped over as part of the engine swap, and the
flywheel on this engine was left loose, so I thought I'd have a go at setting
the crank end float.

The initial measurement (with the original shims) was 0.8mm (0.032&quot;)! Took the
flywheel off again, made sure everything was clean, and tried again. Still the
same. &quot;Ok&quot;, I thought, &quot;It's not the original fly-wheel, perhaps these things
happen&quot;. So I pulled the original shims (with a bent paperclip), Yep, all 3 are
there, and I stick in an additional couple of spare shims, and start to put
everything back together. As I tighten the gland nut, the engine starts to lock
up; &quot;OK&quot;, I thought, &quot;I've over done it with the shims. Strange, since I only
added 0.6mm(0.024&quot;). Must be dirt in the works&quot;. So I start to slacken things,
and the flywheel turns about 5 degrees before coming to a dead (metal against
metal) stop! Out of curiosity, I nipped the gland nut up a bit more. The
flywheel still turns easily to and fro through about 5 degrees. Since I now
should have #1 main clamped to the crank, this must mean that it's turning in
the case, yes? Also, there is still crank end-float in this condition, much the
same as before. I can't detect any *radial* play in the end of the crank.

So the question is: Am I on the right lines with the diagnosis, and if I am, is
it worth keeping this engine with a view to rebuilding it myself, or are the
cases likely to be scrap because of the loose main bearing hammering around ?

What can line boring recover ?

Your collective wisdom would be appreciated.
