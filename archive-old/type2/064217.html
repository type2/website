Subject: more on Folly

I did just a little more work o Folly's motor today... removed the last 
of the nuts / studs holding the exhaust system up.  Think that thing 
would come off...  No sir.  In spite of all that banging!  I'll work on 
that.

I have squirted lots o penetrating oil in the spark plug holes hoping 
that will do something good! 

When I get the exhaust off, I can get to the rest of the trip.

Oh well.
