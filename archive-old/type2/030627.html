volks, 

With the uncertainties accompanying the search for a new home for the
list, let me remind everyone of the status file that I maintain at my web
site, along with the most recent digests.  The current status of the list
will always be at:

http://www2.ari_dot_net/dworkin/

During normal times, it won't change much :-)  But if anything happens,
the news will be there as quickly as I can get it there.

In theory, there is no difference between theory and practice. 
But, in practice, there is.
