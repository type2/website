&gt;Go to Sears tomorrow and buy an 8mm allen socket.  On a 3/8&quot; drive ratchet
&gt;or extension handle with a 1' cheater pipe... *then* you have the torque
&gt;you need to remove those bolts.  The torque spec for them is not that
&gt;high, but they have been in place for 20+ years and will take 100+ ft./lb.
&gt;of torque to get started (which is why they need to be clean and why a
&gt;little L wrench won't touch them :-(

To get more leverage from an Allen wrench, try using a deep metric socket
and a ratchet extension of the appropriate or approximate size. Fit this
combination to the Allen wrench to extend the wrench. Works for me.
