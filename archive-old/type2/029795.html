Subject: Rebuild kit for 72-74 gas pump?
Message-ID: &lt;Pine.BSF.4.05.10101231329190.16464-100000_at_mtolympus.ari_dot_net&gt;

Volks, 

Does anyone know if there is a rebuild kit available for the '72-74
mechanical fuel pump?  I know they are not all that popular, but I have
one and I'd like to do a rebuild on it.

                           H Steven Dolan
