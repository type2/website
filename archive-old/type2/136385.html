Subject: Re: [T2] RE: Front Door Seals- glue or not?

&gt; Do I really need to use glue other than on the hinges side where there
&gt; is no groove?
&gt;
&gt; Hi Mike,
&gt;
&gt; I have had some that would stay tightly in the channels without glue and others that wouldn't. I would not use glue (except on the hinge side) and try it for awhile. If it wants to come out of the channel you can always glue it later.

i have found that you need to glue at least part of it to keep it in place
usually the corners and around the hinges etc where it wants to come
loose.
