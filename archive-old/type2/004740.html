Subject: re exhaust leak

You need to fix the exhaust leak.  There is no need to pull the engine to
remove the exhaust manifolds. Dismantle the exhaust with the engine in the
bus.  This is relatively easy on your newly rebuilt, non-corroded
setup...sometimes impossible on old rusty corroded exhausts where studs, etc
snap off.
If the exhaust manifold is leaking, get it off and look closely at the
flange.  These can warp.  Place the flange against a perfectly flat surface.
If you see air in between, take it to someone with a hydraulic press and
adapters and have them carefully(!) flatten the flange again.  This will
allow the triangular gaskets to do their job of sealing the exhaust leak.
Good luck!

So my question is this: assuming the worst location for an exhaust leak -
where the exhaust manifold bolts on to the head - what will happen if I keep
running it without fixing the leak? I'm just getting ready to go camping and
don't want to pull the engine again just yet .Thanks in advance for all
advice.
