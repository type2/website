Yes I am with you there I have already started the FI round up. Question for 
you is that the Auto does not use the vacuum line, but the standard does? 
Then in my search for FI should I be hasty about the system I buy and look 
specifically for a setup from a 77 Automatic? Or does this make a difference 
in regaurds to Vacuum?

&gt;you should have at least one vacuum line to the brake booster,  the 77auto

Is this the thick line from the intake manifold, centered and just below the 
carb? It leaves the engine compartment at the drivers side and goes toward 
the front of the bus.
