&gt; If you read the site, they show the costs of running it. About 1.50 Euros to
&gt; recharge the tank for another 2-300 km. That is cheap, compared to gas.

Lessee, 220V, running at 15A, for 5.5 hours to recharge.  That's $3.63 US
at $0.20 per kWh.  It also amounts to 65 megajoules of energy.  So far so
good.fill

However, the car has a 300atm tank that holds 90m^3.  The work required
to fill that is about 1300 megajoules, assuming something like a
straight line on the PV diagram.

Something does not compute!
