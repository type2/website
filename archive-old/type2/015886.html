 Many thanks to all who have helped with my recent oil leak to tappet repair.
I can now report a quiet smooth running motor!!!!!!!!! and at present leak
free!!!!!
My apology for incorrect use of english, i.e. I had been referring to the
adjusting screw as a tappet and the tappet as a lifter. which may have
confused some. 
I have now replaced all adjusting screws and hydraulic tappets. Also, I put
in the new brown (red) pushrod seals after removing the leaking green and
black ones. I pushed these inplace with an old tube (bought four new ones)
which worked very nice with a slight bump from a rawhide mallet.

Thanks to all for help and patience, Steven Phelps. The list is a wonderful
tool!
