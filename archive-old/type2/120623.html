Subject: Re: [T2] FRONT CHILDS COT

Geez, I have written the differences so many times I
am not going to do it again.
LOOK in the type 2 archives AND library.
That is what they are there for!!

 While we're on this topic...any information on the
 specifics of the sizes/poles/brackets differences
 between years?
 I've actually been looking to buy off Samba but some
 say all years are the same, some 68-71 are
 different, some black poles, some gray poles, etc. 
 I don't know what to get.
 What's the deal and what should fit on a 73?  gray
 poles yes, black poles no?  what's the difference
 between the poles?   -Chris
