Subject: Re: [T2] Jack

&gt; VW jack, has a round base, but it has a hex bolt
&gt; head that a handle would go onto for cranking.
&gt; The only markings on it are &quot;Bilstein&quot; on the
&gt; part that goes into the jackpad.

I bought a jack like that a few weeks ago. It is came
in a bag made of the darkbeige upholstery of an older
type of baywindow. In the bag was also a tube shaped
object by which you could unscrew a spark plug. This
tube-thing fits around the hex bolt. A metal stick was
also included, you can put it through two holes that
are in the tube-thing (sorry, I don't know the word
for it) and so you can probably lift your bus by using
the metal stick as a crank. I don't know as to how far
all the pieces are original.

I also bought a jack which has a crank instead of the
hex bolt plus a green-plastic knob at the end. I
suspect this one is from a later type since it
resembles very much the jack that came with my 1982
Vanagon.

I guess 'Bilstein' is the company that made the jacks.
My Vanagon jack has also 'Bilstein' stamped into it
along with the VW logo and the VW partnumber ('251 ...
...').
