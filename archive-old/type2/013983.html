Subject: Re: [VB] So I done did it. I bought a welder.

&gt; Is your plan for more welder to cut down on the warping???

Eh? no!   Completely unrelated comments.

the warpage was because I wasnt bothering to attempt not to.  When you
run, say, 6 beads about 3/4&quot; apart about 6 inches long side by side....

:)

&gt; I have used my Lincoln SP125 for lots of sheet metal welding, but have it

The lincoln sp125 is more along the lines of the..oh._dot_millermatic (BAH
miller changed their site so my old links dont work..)

What I was thinking of is the 130XP, actually:

http://www_dot_millerwelds_dot_com/occasional/products/mig/M10500/

Lincoln's site appears to have changed as well, and now they dont even
list the 100 and 125 models. (both of which i had bookmarked.)

I have found via the search (but not the normal product listings..) the
weld-pak 100, which is actually the model I have.

http://www.lincolnelectric_dot_com/products/wprod/rpg/pk100155.asp

And the sp125plus:

http://www.lincolnelectric_dot_com/products/wprod/sp125plus.asp


the sp135T appears to the the smallest they list in their normal product
list now:

http://www.lincolnelectric_dot_com/products/wprod/sp135t.asp

A search of the lincoln site no longer shows the sp-100 at ALL.

Anyway.  I'm pretty sure the Millermatic 135XP can handle sheetmetal
fairly well...Kelly? Am I wrong to remember that this is the one you use
most of the time?


The biggest factor here though is that if I need genuine parts (sure, the
CH crap that they sell on the shelf at lowes might work..but so might
those taiwanese piston rings.) I have to mail order them.  If i switch to
a miller, I can pick them up at a dozen area shops.

That, to me, is worth another hundred bucks.

Besides, I prefer blue tools. I hate red. ~grin~

anywho.
