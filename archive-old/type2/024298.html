Message-ID: &lt;7js3t5$kkp8_at_eGroups_dot_com&gt;

A sudden relocation dictates that I must sell my '78 bus before I was able
to begin *really* woking on it. It has a *running* 2.0 FI with a rod bearing
out, so it hasn't ran since i found that out last fall (after I put a new 
alternator, regulator, and battery in it. There are no seats in it (I was 
planning on creating a custom camper interior). It was originally cream/orange
two-tone, the P.O. decided that Krylon blue spray paint would cover the orange.
The body is strait but; rusted rockers, along wheelwells, and a 4x12 inch hole
in cargo area. Two new front tires. I'm near Chicago, someone please come and
tow it away. Make an offer, it's not worth much as it sits but had/has good
potential for a mid-western dime-a-dozen bay.
