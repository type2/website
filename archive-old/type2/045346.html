Subject: RE: [T2] Mystery heater

&gt;I looked inside '77 or '78 and found an electric heater with two 
&gt;12 volt motors on either side. The whole assembley runs horizontal 
&gt;underneath the dash itself and is moulded to fit around the parking 
&gt;brake. 

That's not a heater.  That's a DPD brand air conditioner.  

The condensor for it is a big (3foot x 3foot) louvered assembly that mounts 
under the belly and the compressor is mounted in the right, rear of the engine 
compartment and is driven by a belt from a pulley on the crankshaft.  

Even if you don't want AC, the blowers make for nice airflow inside your bus if 
you don't mind loosing a bit of knee-room for the the unit itself.
