&gt;Do all pancake engines overheat at idle? It seems to me that my 1600 ran

My two liter pancake cools off at idle, even in the heat.  My highway oil
pressure will get down to 25psi on the gauge if it's 100 degrees out and
I'm on the freeway for a long time, and if I pull over, the oil light will
come on at anything under about 1400 rpm.  However, the gauge still shows
~5-6 psi, definately more than zero.  When I run it in hot conditions, I
set the idle up to 1400 rpm even though I don't really believe that 5psi at
idle will destroy my engine.

&gt;Is this valve rebuildable?

Not much there to rebuild... just a piston and a spring, right?  Have you
replaced both already?  You know there are *two* pressure relief valves on
your engine, right?  One on the bottom and one in between the pushrod tubes
on I believe the driver's side.

&gt;Is there a kit available? I haven't been able to find one.

You should be able to find new parts at a VW flaps.

&gt;Is there another place on the engine I could check the pressure outside of
&gt;the cooler and filter galley?

Not easily.  It really sounds like your pressure relief valve is sticking
open though.  I'd keep on that.
