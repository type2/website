Subject: Re: [T2] Searching archives for thread &quot;1600 into a 74 bus&quot;

Thanks.  I have this and the company that provides the
fiberglass bookmarked previously.  

What I really was trying review all the arguments for
and against a slightly modified type I engine vs. the
type IV.  I remember Raby and others discussing the
matter and there being some good points made.  

I guess I need to save my type2 digests locally.

&gt; The archives are a source of frustration to me!
&gt; BTW, I loved my '74 with a type I. I'd still have it
&gt; it it wasn't totalled due to a tyre blowout!

&gt; &gt; I remember this recent thread, but cannot seem to
&gt; &gt; find
&gt; &gt; it in the archives.  I searched &quot;type IV engine
&gt; type
&gt; &gt; I&quot; and came up with one of the postings.  This
&gt; gave
&gt; &gt; me
&gt; &gt; the title of the thread.  But a search for that
&gt; &gt; title
&gt; &gt; did produce the appropriate responses.  It seems
&gt; to
&gt; &gt; search only the body of the post, not the title.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Is there a better way?
