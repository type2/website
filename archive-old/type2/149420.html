Subject: Re: no power on Aceleration

Hi!

Another possible explanation is dirt in the fuel line--maybe at the filter 
screen at the bottom of the gas tank. Not enough blockage to stop the flow 
of gas completely, but enough to prevent running much above idle speed. That 
would explain the symptoms, including might why the trouble began suddenly.

Hope this helps. Good luck!

1970 bus w/ VW de Mexico engine
Beaverton OR USA

&gt;I m having a litle big problem in my bus. she4s an 1969, 1600 cc single 
&gt;port engine with an solex 30-pict 1 carburator. I`ve checked everything i 
&gt;can remenber but she seems to backfire throw the carb.
&gt;Every time i step on the gas a bit faster it stumbles and lose rpm but if i 
&gt;don4t acelarate or step slowly there is nothing wrong.
&gt;I wonder if the problem is the carb but what I  don4t understand is why she 
&gt;ran well before.
&gt;i4ve cheked the valves, the poits, the timing, the spark plugs and now i 
&gt;honestly don4t know what to do.
