&gt; Im getting ready to install the engine back into my 71 single cab.
&gt; What I 
&gt; want to know is, should I install the engine hanger/support before or
&gt; after 
&gt; I hook the engine to the tranny. I've always done it before, but i've
&gt; always 
&gt; had trouble getting the hanger to mount up. A crowbar always helps,
&gt; but its 
&gt; still a pain.

I bolt the support to the engine before I install it.  It's a lot
easier to line up that way, IMO.
