I had to chuckle at reading Micheal Wagner's earlier post today exhulting in 
his joy at passing the DREADED CALIFORNIA SMOG TEST. Been there, done that, 
same reaction! I don't know what it is about beating the system that makes 
one feel so good, but there it is.
I recall a few years back nervously sitting in the waiting room of the 
dreaded secondary &quot;official state-operated test station&quot; to which I had been 
consigned with my '67 BMW 1600 as a &quot;gross polluter',  waiting for the 
verdict as I listened through the closed door while  the engine of my baby 
was revved. When the inspector came in to give me the good word, I felt just 
like a first time Dad-to-be in the delivery dept. waiting room being told I 
was now a Dad. (Actually I was in the delivery room for both my kids, thanks 
to Dr. Lamaze!).
But in any case, congrats to Michael on another 2-year lease on life! My '75 
also has just a couple of more checks before freedom, though it has never 
been too hard to get it passed, what with the FI. The Solex- carbureted BMW 
is already off the hook, and I'll never give it up, despite the pleas of my 
wife.
