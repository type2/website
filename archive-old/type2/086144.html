Subject: STAINLESS STEEL '68-71 Exhaust Kit  $99!

&gt;I just ordered a stainless steel stock muffler setup from Bus
&gt; Depot for $99. Last muffler you'll ever have to buy. Tom

&gt; I bought the complete Ernst kit from bus depot. I have not put
&gt; it on yet but the quality is good and it is the correct single exhaust.

&gt; Are you guys talking about 211 251 053EC ?  Where does it say it's SS?


Actually, Tom is not talking about the Ernst kit, but rather about an
exhaust system that I hadn't even announced yet.  He inquired about
stainless steel a few weeks ago, and since I knew these were coming, I let
him pre-order a couple of kits.  They arrived at the Depot today.

This is a stock Bus muffler, except with a Stainless Steel body rather than
mild steel.  I are getting it from the same South African supplier who
supplies our '72-74 and '86-91 stainless mufflers.  Many on this list have
bought the '72-74 ones and have commented favorably about them here.

Also included is a single piece damper/tailpipe.  This is the stock pipe
used on European spec busses, and is essentially the same as the separate
tail and damper pipes used on U.S. spec exhausts except that it's all one
piece.  Finally, an installation kit (gaskets and hardware) is also
included.  As packaged, this fits '68-71.  If you want one for a splitty,
email me.

I should note that only the muffler body is stainless, not the
damper/tailpipe or the flanges.  However, the price is no more than a mild
steel system, and the muffler should FAR outlast any mild steel muffler.
Since it is a duplicate of the stock muffler other than being stainless, it
will look, perform, and sound the same as stock.  I think this is an
absolute bargain at $99.95.

In fact it may be too good a bargain.  While I had hoped to hit the magic
&quot;under $100&quot; price point, my landed cost was a bit higher than I'd hoped.
So while I'm going to run it for $99.95 for now, once I sort out my total
landed cost including customs etc., I may have to adjust the price upward a
bit.

The part number is 211 251 053ES.  It is NOT on the website, and will not be
for at least a few days or a week (probably until I determine whether I can
really run it for $99.95 or not).  But you CAN order it by phone in the
meantime and I will honor the $99.95 price for listmembers.
