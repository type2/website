Subject: Re: [T2] 68 Baywindow Wheel Locked Up 

----- Original Message -----
&gt;   Also, today while returning some tools I borrowed yesterday I had the
&gt; passenger side rear wheel brakes lock up.  I bled them again this
&gt; morning because I just couldn't get enough brake for my peddle.  It
&gt; didn't help, in fact, that particular wheel didn't bleed correctly, it
&gt; just kind of dribbled out.  I suspect the slave is the main culpret.  I
&gt; will take the wheel off later and see.

    I would be suspect of the flexible brake line for that wheel. If it is
clogged or partially clogged you will certainly have issues bleeding the
wheel cylinder properly and there is some potential for the wheel cylinder
to not release properly when you remove your foot from the break pedal.
Just my $.02 - Jeff
