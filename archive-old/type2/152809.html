Subject: Re: [T2] Re: front brake trouble

BTW I forgot to mention the inner and outer bearings for each of the rotors.
They are cheap, but unless they are making noise or have bad scoring, they
aren't absolutely necessary to change, but might as well while its apart.
 Also - I was just informed, that whichever way the bus pulls, that is the
side that is working. For example, if it was pulling to the right, the left
is not working as hard. Also that the hoses go first, but that may or may
not fix your problems...I guess i always spoil BusZilla, but in turn i am
spoiling myself....I also have a bit of extra horsepower, so the full
tune-up on the brakes was necessary.
 :)
Happy bussing.

&gt; When it pulls to one side when braking, I believe whichever side it pulls
&gt; to, is the caliper that is not braking enough (I often get this backwards,
&gt; so please those of you who know, correct me).
