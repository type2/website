Subject: Re: [T2] Great North American Extreme Bus Race + the hubcap

Hi Mark,

Well, if it can be arranged well see what we can do for you.

But hang on a dang minute here.... Do you even own a running  
Baywindow bus??  Every time I've seen you it's been with a splitty or  
a vanagon.

Doesn't the hubcap had to be carried in a Bus??? I think the list  
should weigh in on this one.


Happy Trails,

Greg Potts
