Subject: Re: [T2] bilge blower heater retrofit

Ok, I got an idea here.

I want to get more air flowing up front, but I don't want to put a fan 
in-line because it will melt.  Here's my new thought:

I would put a fan underneath the car and suck air from inside of the 
car.. like from the rear heater vent, for example.  Then, the output of 
the blower will connect to the warm-air pipe at an angle to the main 
pipe that goes from the back to front like this:


    |   |
    |   |
    | ^  \
    | |   \
    |    ^ \
    |     \ \
    | ^ |\   \
    | | | \   \
    |   |  BBBB

where BBB is the output of the additional blower.  If this worked, it 
would essentially pull the air in the main tube forward and send it on 
it's way up.  This way, the fan wouldn't need to be in the airflow. 
Yes, the air coming forward would be cooled by the mixed air, but if I 
pulled that air from interior duct, it would help recirculate the air more.

I know that it is essentially creating a vacuum and sucking the air 
forward, but this is the best I can think of besides hooking up a leaf 
blower to the ducts in the engine compartment.

Or, if someone has any recommendations for a temperature resistant 
inline blower, that would be handy as well.

Whatcha think?

Mike
