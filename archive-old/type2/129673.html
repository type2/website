Subject: RE: [T2] vacuum port on carb

I will take your word for it on the port since you have a set. I have 2 emails
from them saying that they do not have the port, but they may have no idea
what they are looking for.

How well will this carb perform on a stock type 4 engine?

Thanks,
Corbett

&quot;those CB performance solexes have a vacuum port on the drivers side
carb. it exits away from the center of the engine as well. The web
site is really vauge about the details, and the email responces from
them are many times non existant. However for the money (at least on
my upright engine) this was a very good buy for me. I really enjoy
these carbs.&quot;
