Subject: [T2] 75 oil breather Q's

My 75 was pushing oil out of the dipstick tube, so I was advised to 
clean the oil breather.  I did and it was really gunked up in there.  
I tried to blow through the part where the hose hooks onto and it 
didn't seem to let a bunch of air through...is this correct ?  

Should air flow freely through the breather, or just flow a little 
bit ?  Is there a valve in there so air only flows one direction 
(opposite to the way I was blowing) ?

Any info would be greatly appreciated...
