Subject: hose missing

On the left side of the fan housing on my 78 westy, there seems to be a
male connectior for a half inch (apx) hose.
I just noticed it yesterday. It is on the left vertical wall of the
housing, facing the extra battery. Any ideas what its for?
I am just wondering if it as anything to do with the bus not starting
for more than 3-5 seconds... But thats another story for later on...

Thanks in advance
