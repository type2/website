Subject: Re: [T2] Bus carpeting question.

Chris,

You didn't say *who* you were getting the carpet set from!

The TMI set that I got for my 78 appears to be ok(haven't installed 
yet)...but!  the two pieces that go under the front seats were NOT
finished correctly and i had to send them back.

The edges on the outside were just bare...took pics and sent them
to a rep at TMI and he said that whoever sewed them had not finished
them correctly.  The other edges very covered/sewn with cloth, just
as I had ordered them.

They sent them back with very rugged looking wide vinyl strips sewn
in...don't know about the fit yet.

I got the impression from all of my phone conversations with the folks at
TMI that somehow they weren't doing a very good job of quality control.

See my previous posts on the subject of the headliner I got from them.

Good luck, dave

&gt; Hey everybody,
&gt; 
&gt; I am going to be getting a carpet set here pretty soon, and want to welcome 
&gt; any advice or comments.
&gt; 
&gt; I am looking to get the 10pc chicken set for a 74 bus with buckets. From the 
&gt; internet pics, these look to carpet the entire interior floor, with exception 
&gt; to the two troughs for the brake reservoir and the other for the jack. 
&gt; Apparently, they have a 2pc. carpet set for each wheelhouse as well.
&gt; Anyone have one of these sets? Do they cover well? Are the edges finished off 
&gt; tastefully; moreover, ruggedly? 
&gt; 
&gt; TIA for your comments.
