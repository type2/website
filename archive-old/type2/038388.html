Subject: In the cradle of the Civil War (Everybus trip report)

I flew in to Baltimore Friday afternoon (boy, were my arms tired!), and
Steve met me at the airport and we heading straight for the freeway (is
that what y'all call 'em out there? freeways? highways?) Anyway, the 95
South. Later on we were well on our way -- by then on the 85 -- it was
well after dark, and up an on-ramp here comes the first bus (a bay)
we've seen all day, and it honks at us! So I'm waving out the back
window like the maniacal out-of-towner dorkus that I am, and when he
pulls up alongside us -- it's Sean Bartnik! Who lives just down the
street from Steve! So we had our own little carabus Friday evening.

Saturday was the tour of Kelly's shop, which if I did nothing else all
weekend, that was the one thing I just had to do. If only so I could
bitch-slap him for calling me Elmo. ;-) I'm just in awe of his work --
it's so fine to see a master craftsman, someone who (deservedly) takes
so much pride in a job well done. Now I'm trying to figure out how I can
justify taking a long vacation to North Carolina so I can leave my bus
with Kelly for the nose, et al. ... Hey, I can dream! I really think he
needs some sort of marker for his work, Body by Fisher sort of thing
maybe, license plate brackets are popular out here, or at least a
discreet, clear sticker -- I'd be proud to display it on my bus if he
were to do the work.

Saturday night was the big potluck and jam session in the pavilion. Dave
Jersey got me good -- walks up and starts asking me how's ol' Bob doing
that he hasn't seen since way back when we all used to party together in
Sausalito all those years ago. People have done this sort of thing to me
-- &quot;Hey, Pam, how was Oregon?&quot; -- so I just sort of short-circuited.
Dave said I got the deer in the headlights look. Now there's a
switch.... Turns out he lives for this sort of thing. Weisenheimer. :-)

The jam session was one of the most democratic I've ever seen. If you
can yell at least most of the words to &quot;Wild Thing&quot; at the top of your
lungs, then you get to join in the jam session. I love it. I heard
someone doing a toppo voce rendition of &quot;I Will Survive&quot; that has Donna
Summer turning in her grave and she's not even dead yet (that was the
best, as far as I'm concerned). And Doc Ric's girls were trying to get
people to let them tie them to the center pole with their jump rope (my
kinda gals). It was *really* scary when they found the point-ed
stick.... hee hee

Sunday was Farmington and that was cool! Not so much the VW races as the
swap meet. I'm sooo happy to see VWs get so thoroughly recycled. I got a
horn button for my friend Gary's 1970 Bug &quot;Dexter,&quot; and o-rings for my
carbs where the air filter things sit (one was missing). I coulda gone a
bit crazier, but can you say &quot;carry-on.&quot; I knew ya could. 

I did manage to find Chad and hook up with him to get his Adventurewagen
all prettified. I'm glad he wants to restore it -- what he's managed to
do in just the past week that he's had it is impressive so far. I gotta
send him copies of the literature I've got and do a photo shoot for
details on the interior of my bus for him. And then all the other folks
I got to meet in person finally -- it was so great! 

Besides all that, I've only recently developed an interest in the Civil
War -- it's possible (though unconfirmed) that my ggg-grandfather was a
casualty. It was exciting to see so many newly-familiar placenames --
Fredericksburg, Petersburg, Appomattox, Rappahannock. Chris Huff's
impressive knowledge of Civil War sites leaves me in the dust! I wish I
could spend more time in the area just soaking up the history and doing
family history research. Some day....

P.S. Charlie Ford, get ahold of me -- I got you a present.
