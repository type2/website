&gt;Measure the new compressor pulley and compare with the old OEM pulley. If

I suspect the small (narrow) belt will drive the Sanden just fine, since it 
takes so much less HP than the original piston compressor.

Ace or True Value has a very good selection of &quot;general purpose&quot; belts in 
all widths.  I recently purchased one to repair a dryer and it looked to be 
the same width as the stock A/C belt.  I bet you could find a belt that 
would work for your A/C there.
