Is their a web sight where we can type in our ID plate info and Westy info
to find out  the where fors and such. I know theirs one for vintage buses
but didn't see any 68 up listed so didn't want to enter it their.

Our westy is also raised up in the front, it looks like more than it should,
or is this normal with a non pop top westy? I'm not sure how good the shocks
are but don't think they would make much of a difference.

My first full weekend with her, I hope to get her GOOD and CLEAN!!!!!!
Thanks
