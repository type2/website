Subject: Re: Fuel Filler Hose - Help!
References: &lt;199812182229.PAA13712_at_yiff.azaccess_dot_com&gt;

      I got a fuel hose of the correct diameter from a local auto supply
-- one of the kind that supplies the local repair shops and has lots of
real stuff,  and also does machine shop service, etc. Not like the ones
that sell mirror decorations, etc. Anyway, although it was good quality
hose, and fairly expensive, it wasn't the pre-formed VW part that was
original. So -- I tried putting a large coil spring from a radiator hose
in it, but that only helped a little. The problem is that the bends it
has to make put a kink in the hose, so that now I have to fill it on the
lowest pump setting, or it surges back and stops the pump. PITA, but
better than having gas pour all over the engine everytime you filled up
like it did with the leaky filler hose.
      If I was doing it over, I'd get a steel elbow of the right size
from a muffler shop, and cut the hose and put the elbow in the middle.
Might still do that later on.
