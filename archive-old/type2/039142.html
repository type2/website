Funny, I am a pilot and there is NO WAY you should ever use oil designed for
airplanes.  Some airplane motors actually use mineral oil for the first 50
hours of operation.  Can you imagine the horrible outcome in a VW?  Stay
away from that stuff!  Just because they are air cooled and look similar
does not mean they were engineer even remotely close.

Hi Ron

&gt; BTW, , ,  I recomember using AeroShell oil in my veedubs. It was designed
&gt;  for air cooled engines.
&gt;  
&gt;  Any comments about that?

Yeah... it's made for a totally different application than the environment
in 
and around a VW motor...

You have a tremendous RPM range in a car; an airplane holds at the same RPM 
for sometimes hours.  The seals are of different materials, as are the 
bearings (Airplane cams are generally rollers, VW are solid lobe and solid 
lifter), the oil is made to hold different metals in situ, the detergents in

Airplane oil are different than Auto oil... the ambient temps are a *lot* 
different in the 2 different environments, etc...

I could go on, but to make it simple... I put 60,000 miles worth of wear on
a 
motorcycle (honda 750) motor in less than 10, 000 using Aeroshell.  I wrote 
the company; the told me *definately* not for auto applications... and as I 
was using a non-approved product in the bike, they really didn''t want to 
help me (and didn't), but did tell me what wear I caused before I told them 
(Flattening cam lobes, galled bearing surfaces, destroyed seals)... Mind
you, 
they make more on Aeroshell, and were it economic, they would rather sell
the 
more profitable item... they told me to go with the Rotella oils instead.  
Serious about this.  **DON'T** run Aeroshell in your car.

If you don't believe me, call Shell.  They wil give you the skinny on it, 
really.  Their product info line is really good.
