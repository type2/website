Subject: Re: [T2] Adding and Converting AC Systems

Interesting.  I visited Jerry at his shop a couple of years ago and got the 
impression that he wasn't going to stay &quot;in the business&quot; much longer.  In 
any case, he probably could help.  In my book, he qualifies as a Bus/AC 
guru even though I don't agree with everything he says.  He did also make a 
kit to mount the Sankyo/Sanden compressor in the stock location which 
looked very nice.  Wasn't cheap though.
