Hi,

Everyone stares at buses driving down the highway right?  Why not track down 
one of the places that puts graphics on the side of public trans. buses -the 
kind that go up over the windows and everything- and turn your bus into a 
moving PSA billboard?  Certainly if you contacted a cancer 
prevention/awareness group they would want to support your effort.  They may 
already have graphics from their own PSA stuff that they could let you use.  
In addition you should put a web address on the bus for people to look up.

I've thought about doing this on my own bus.  Not the PSA about cancer, but 
turning my bus into a moving billboard.  I thought about selling the 
potential ad space that the sides of my bus could provide.  I will soon be 
driving back and forth from DC to Baltimore everyday in rush hour 
traffic....

Anyway, that's my 2 cents.

Jeffrey
