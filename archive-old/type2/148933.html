Hi CJ,

A RobotDeathSquad with &quot;Electrical Woes&quot;? Sounds like a good thing to  
me, but YMMV.

Don makes an excellent point. You can't go by the color of the  
battery terminals, because quite often some P.O. has swapped in a red  
one for the ground line. I always make a point to confirm which  
terminal is bolted to the body of the chassis of the bus ---  
Regardless of color or position, THAT's the negative terminal. Accept  
no substitutes.

Getting this wrong can destroy sensitive circuitry, wreck an  
expensive battery or possibly lead to an Earth Shattering Kaboom.


Happy trails,
