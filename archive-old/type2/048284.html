&gt; Yes, GR17X is for the 69-71 bus and is longer. it takes the concave backing

AND it takes a special cast iron generator pulley, they tend to break and
are unavialable new. Without the proper pulley and backing plate the
generator is next to useless... make sure you have all 3 parts before
attempting to install this combo.

take care,
