Subject: RE: Update: City gave bus the boot

Funny... I just a what sounds like a similar run-in.  Got a nastygram from
the city telling me that my bus was a &quot;visual blight&quot; -- shows how little
they know!

Anyhow, long story short, decided to but it back on the road, too.  Had it
towed to local VW shop, he got it running but discovered that it won't pass
emissions, low compression on one cylinder.  So, drove it home last night
(yeah!), stalled out once I left the freeway (sigh!), but nursed it home.

Called emissions folks, talked to a fellow who had driven a '64 camper from
Turkey to Kashmir in his youth.  Very sympathetic in trying to find a way to
help me weasel out of the emissions requirements, but in the end, nothing
for it.

So!  I am faced with my first engine rebuild.  For that matter, first engine
removal.  Eeek!  Muir in hand, but it makes me feel shaky anyway.  Looking
to start in on it later this summer (wife &amp; I are taking some
maternity/paternity leave late June...).  

'72 412 1700 FI, or so I'm told.  The '72, Type IV, and FI I can vouch for.
Automatic tranny, Westfalia conversion.  Named &quot;Entropy,&quot; as I've put more
miles on it trailered than under its own power (about 3-to-1 ratio :-/).
Wife's been very tolerant.

Question: I know that Muir's book says to label everything you pull off --
but with what kind of tape???  Between grease and dirt, everything I've
tried just falls off.  The main thing that terrifies me about doing this is
the prospect of not being able to piece it together again.  I know it's a
silly thing, but I'm really curious.  Do you gurus just *know* what hooks up
where?  Or do you have some special super-sticky tape?  Or is my engine
compartment just unconscionably filthy?

Thanks in advance -- glad to be back on list!
