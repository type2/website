Subject: RE: Westy Roof Resto (L)

Budd asks...

I pulled out a nice roof and luggage rack from the junkyard today for my 
'71 Westy.

For instance, to smooth it out and paint it should I send it to a shop that 
specializes in fiberglass camper shells or boats?  Should I just wait until 
then and have the body shop work on it at the same time as my bus body? 
 I've seen someone post to the list you should use only a special 
fiberglass paint.  What about the fibers that have worn through?  Will 
paint smooth this over?


When I bought my 68 Westy the fiberglass top was thrashed.  The roof sagged 
in the middle and held water!

In 1968 Westfailia made the first full length pop-top for the bus.  In 
1969+ they improved it by adding rib like indentations from side to side 
along the top.


Fiberglass.....

My little three month pop-top resto project did not have the ribs, so I 
don't know what to do with that type of top, however, I do know that there 
are 3 or 4 layers of glass ply in my top and prolly close to the same in 
yours.  That was the worst part of the resto - finding the bubbles, between 
layers, and sanding them until all delaminated glass ply was removed 
(lots-o-dust!).  In some cases I was left with one thin layer that, if I 
had dropped a tool on, could have ripped like paper.  Once sanded and 
cleaned with Acetone I re-applied new layers to approximate the thickness 
of the surrounding areas.  All problems I had with the fiberglass were on 
the outside of the pop-top.  After sanding I applied a marine grade 
anti-fungus paint (white - $140.00 a gallon)  that in two years as stood up 
quite well.  BTW - I only bought one quart and applied one coat - should 
have been two.  I did not use gellcoat.

Wood......

After flipping the top over there was some carpentry to do.  From front to 
back there are 2 strips of wood about 5/8in wide by 2in high that add some 
structural firmness to the top and provide a place to attach the canvas 
along with the front hinges.  Well the PO b4 the PO had at some point 
forced the top up when the hinge (over the driver) really did not want to 
go up.  This resulted in seperation of wood and fiberglass.  Screws were 
then used to repair it, but rusted out years ago.

So I took a sample of the remains to the local lumber yard and they copied 
piece in Poplar.  After removing the old piece with a wood chisle and disk 
sander, I installed the new piece using construction cement (in tubes).  I 
let it sit for a few days then re-installed the little supports found along 
the outer  edge of the new piece.  Then fiberglassed the outer edge and 
anywhere I could for strength (copied from the other side at this point).

The wood piece that crosses the roof at the rear end had colapsed in the 
middle - main reason for sagging.  With the roof laying on its top (upside 
down) I supported it in such a way as to simulate the original curve of the 
roof.  Bricks laying in the middle and angle iron under propping up the 
outer edges.  The crossmember was repaired without removal - forced back 
into its original shape it was covered with several layers of glass and 
resin.

Since the bricks were holding the shape really well I decided to reinforce 
the section of roof that had no crossmembers (what u see from inside the 
bus).  I sanded and applied a coat of resin - then dropped a piece of 
cardboard 4x18in down and covered and glassed it in place, then another 
piece 2x16in on top of that did the same.  About 12in forward of that I 
used another 4x18 piece but put a V shaped piece face down on top of that 
for even more support - worked well - I now have a quasi handel when 
raising the top.

Hope this helps.....
