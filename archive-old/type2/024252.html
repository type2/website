Subject: Turn Signal nightmare
To: type2_at_type2_dot_com

I have tried to connect the turn signal switch on my '71 bus, and I can't get 
it right.  I am familiar with this type of thing...I rewired the entire dash 
of an old Chevy van I had.  But this is driving me nuts!  I manage to isolate 
each of the front signals, but I can't get the rear lights to come on 
separately.  They insist on flashing together no matter what I do.  Is 
anybody familiar with this wiring?
