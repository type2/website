Subject: disabling valves to stop oil leak

Re Fred Stoermer's super oil leak after piston failure...
Hmm- let's assume the piston is cracked and letting oil into the combustion
chamber.  Oil and smoke out the exhaust..._dot_can't figure out why it's in the
engine compartment unless you cracked the case too....Oil gets pumped out
exhaust valve as engine turns. Instead of polluting the  highway with oil,
why didn't you try disabling the valves in that cylinder by pulling the
valve cover (you did that for the adjustment), pulling the rocker assembly
(2 nuts), and yanking the 2 pushrod tubes for the bad cylinder?  Then the
valves can't open, and the oil happily stays in the engine!  This assumes
you didn't break the valve, or you'd still get oil sloshing down the
exhaust port....Yes the followers get slapped a little (you'd have to
remove the hydraulic kind?), but it should work??  I'd pull the plug wire also.
   Once in my youth I burned an exhaust valve after stupidly putting in big
bores in the 71 Westy before a trip to Fla. from Jersey and forgetting
about compression ratios.  The unequal loping 45 mi from parents house told
me it was not good, and I disabled that cylinder (expecting the valve to
break), but I believe I may have taken out the adjustor screws so the valve
was shut most of the time.....
