My 77 Westy is basically stripped at the moment....

I can't help you with the your problem at hand, having not gone through this 
yet. But DAM! I like the veiw you gave me of my ride all naked inside. Same 
year Same color. The stripes on the outside, are they all the same color? 
The ones on mine look exactly like that, 3 small stripes to make one big 
band around the bus. I only have the ones on top and not the ones mid-door.

Good Luck,

Michael Knight
'77 Westy Deluxe, &quot;el Verde&quot;
