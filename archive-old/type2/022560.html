Subject: Saved a bus?

Just bought the grey bus which would probably have been going to Africa.
It's a 1978 microbus with a 'small' headliner, it's no deluxe, but it has a
slidingroof and 2 slidingwindows. Further, it has seventies-style LM wheels
(ronal?)
No seats in the interiour though, but this makes the car much cheaper in
road-tax.

Have no idea about the car's quality, couldn't check it well, and the keys
dissappeared, but it looked OK enough for $250.
If it's quite Ok, I'll fix it and let it pass the APK (dutch Mot), if not,
I have parts for sale...

Hope the watercooled VAG engine still runs, would be incredibly powerful
compared to the 1600DP which is common here.
