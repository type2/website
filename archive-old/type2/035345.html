&gt; 
&gt; Having a bus in the best possible operating condition is like using a 
&gt; well-tuned Stanley plane. &gt; But such joys are a matter of taste, and taste
is not universal.

Hope you guys don't laugh, but this reminds me of why i use an early-mid 60's
Kirby vacuum cleaner in my home.  Every once in a while, she'll clog up and
i'll have to take it apart and lube it, but its been around thirty some years-
while the five year-old plastic dirt devil i have continues to fall to pieces
and perform substandardly. - i have to fix it almost every time i want to use
it. It is a plastic POS and just doesn't feel good.

I'll have that Kirby another 30 yrs if i'm around, cause i know it will be. It
is a good feeling knowing that at least i will never be shopping for vacuum
cleaners. I think about my bus the same way.  It just feels good knowing i can
take it apart and put it back together and drive it indefinitely - truly the
'Forever Car' to quote B.H.

BTW - I pulled the Kirby out of a trash heap, put a belt on it, cleaned it and
it just works like a champ. Someone didn't know how to clean it and gave up -
kind of like a bus thats been sitting 5 years because of a bad fuel pump.

my .02,
clark
