Subject: Sold two Buses in one week-end

Hi Volks!

Having driven a couple hundred kilometres in a late model Loaf,
I decided that post-'74 Bus seats aren't for me.  My back hurts
even now that I merely think of that trip...  So on an impulse
I threw out not just the post-'74 seats, but the whole Buses.

No, that's just the official version.  What really happened is
me getting thrown out of the hall my Buses reside in, and therefore
selling of the, what shall we call it, less probable project Buses.
The '78 Westy was quite easy to let go of, but selling the '77 
Widebed Pickup hurt.  60k original kilometres!  But without an
engine and with major rust everywhere on the lower ten centimetres,
it was rather too ambitious for my limited resources.  Still, they're 
both going to be on the road soon -- way sooner than they would've 
been if I had kept them.

What remains is a couple Panel Vans ('61, '72, and '72 Highroof,
the '61 and Highroof being projects) and a semi-daily driver '74 
Kombi.

After all, Panel Vans rule.  The older listmembers may remember ;-)

Just wanted you to know.

Airhowlingly yours,
   Erik.
