&gt; My problem:  when I start the car in this cooler weather we are having in

mine has just started doing that ;8*{

&gt; Yes, it does stop turning over, but only after about 3-10 seconds.  This 
&gt; cannot be helping things.  Meanwhile, the engine ALWAYS catches on the third 
&gt; revolution, no mater how cold/hot

I still can't find why mine insists on having to be cranked and cranked to
start on colder mornings.

&gt; I do have an EXCELLENT, almost LIKE NEW '77 AUTOMATIC starter/solenoid which 
&gt; I would be willing to trade (Bob, do you remember??) for a MT setup.  Or 
&gt; sell, for a less than comparable MT setup.

you &quot;Should&quot; be able to use the automatic starter, in fact it is a little
more powerfull.  .8 hp vs .7 for the manual
