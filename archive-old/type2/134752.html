Subject: Re: [T2] Arresting Rust

Yeah, I can definitely attest to that... When I purchased a replacement
windshield for my Bus, the VW that I pulled it out of had a little bit of
windshield rust. I could barely see it, so I didn't think anything of it. I
carefully started to pull on the windshield as I loosened the gasket at the
top. I began to tug a little and before I realized it I had actually pulled
out the entire lower windshield frame... I felt kinda bad... but they were
going to crush that Bus anyway.. so at least I saved the windshield.

&gt; If so are
&gt;there any articles around on removing windows from a
&gt;bus ?


&gt;Removing the windshield is only a matter of cutting the gasket (if you are
throwing it away anyway) or using a &gt;wooden implement to fold it back from the
inside and have a helper pop it out.
