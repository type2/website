Subject: 81 Vanagon Westy California Exhaust

Hi Volks,

My Dad has a 1981 Westy originally from California. He is the second owner.
This weekend the engine started making a bit more noise than it had before,
and when I had a look at it I determined the source to be a small leak in
the muffler. 

The bus is still wearing its original California exhaust and past its most
recent smog inspection with flying colours.

Dad is interested in changing over to the 72-74 stainless system; I'm
wondering if there is a market for used parts (both heater boxes and the
cat-con are still in fine shape) among the CA listmembers, and in feedback
from Vanagon owners who have made the switch to the earlier system. His bus
is now past the age for semi-annual smog inspection.

If there is interest in the used parts I will take pictures of the parts
(currently still installed on the vanagon) and send them to the interested
party.


Happy trails,

Greg Potts
