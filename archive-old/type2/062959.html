Subject: Re: 74 oil capacity

Mark,
It may just take a minute for the oil to make its way down to
the sump, which I believe is where the dipstick takes its
readings. I am not sure of the finer points of overfilling
but I do understand it is not a good thing, and it is something
to be rectified as soon as one discovers it. Good luck.....
&gt; 
&gt; All of the literature I have indicates that the oil capacity of my 74 bus
&gt; (and all air-cooled 72 on) is 3.7 quarts with filter change. My engine seems
&gt; to take about 4.5 quarts before the dipstick reads full (top line). What's
&gt; going on here? Something else I've noticed is that if I leave the dipstick
&gt; in for a while it will indicate a higher level. In other words, if I wipe it
&gt; off, put it in and immediately pull it out it will read full. But if I leave
&gt; it in for a few minutes it will read more than full. What are the
&gt; consequences of overfilling the oil?
