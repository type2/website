I can offer this:

One, the companies or research companies claim that the new gas in 
California affects only a very small portion of the cars in use as far as 
eroding seals or gas rubber lines.  I disagree. Nissan is in the middle 
of a huge recall with all their cars because of a number of gas fires 
related to leaking injectors. Nissan's customer service across the board 
has been less than exemplary and costing its customers lots of time, etc. 
The recall was voluntary, but I think they feard a lawsuit. This is all 
stuff I heard from the Z car mailing list. Also, there is a noted 
increase in engine fires across the board and that has been noted in the 
web page related to Smog Check II in California (Search on KSFO and Smog 
check II to find the server). 

It has been proven that the current gas in CAlifornia only has been 
extremely effective to the smog problem (all other reformulated gases in 
the rest of the country prior to this newest gas in California have been 
shown in testing to have made no significant difference in smog levels 
over older gas).

There are symptoms that are directly related to the new gas that show it 
is not as kind to the cars. they are:
*a decrease in gas mileage, at least 1-2mpg (mines down about 3mpg)
*unexplainable poor idling that cannot be fixed
*rotting seals leading to gas leaks

Solutions?

The new gas has many extra oxygen molecules in the molecule chain that 
are released when combusted. This has the effect of leaning out the gas 
because more oxgen is present to combine with the available HCs. The only 
real solution is to maybe double check all lines, replace lines with 
extra Heavy dUty lines that willnever rot (can find at good hose shops), 
and maybe re-jet carbs to run richer. Also the new gas does not atomize 
as easily (not a problem with fuel injection usually where gas is under 
pressure, but definitely a problem with carbs). I would say connect up 
all the things that have to do with preheating the manifolds, etc on your 
cars to help with atomization. All the pre-heater stuff that came on VWs 
originally are going to be very needed in the near future for the whole 
country as the gas current in california is going to be used across the 
board in all the country (from what I ahve read) within the next two years

Hope some of you found this valuable

\thanks for the bandwidth
