Subject: Body work costs

Check it -
    I went to some body shops to see how much it would cost to get the 65's body
work and paint done. I told the people that I wanted a showroom quality shine,
something I can take to shows and bring home trophys with. I went to three
places, one said it'd take 5-6 weeks and cost between 5 and 6000 bucks. Another
said a month and a half and cost 6000. The third said she'd be off the road for
12 - 14 MONTHS and cost 12,000 dollars!  Yes the comma IS in the right place.
Umm, any thoughts on this? I am definately willing to spend 6 - 8,000 to get
this done, but 12,000? I don't think so Tim. 
    Also, anyone have contacts with people who do repairs on pop-tops? Actually
repair isn't the word, more like rebuild from scratch. The canvas is so old if
you put light pressure on it your finger goes straight through. Any help is
greatly appreciated.
