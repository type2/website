Subject: Re: [T2] '72 Bus-A Year to Avoid?

Jeff,

I have had five buses.
1967,1968,1969,1972,0 and 1972 Westfalia/Euro delivery w/79 motor.

Don't believe the negative hype. There is nothing wrong with '72 
model year buses. True that it is more of a transition year than any 
other model year but that it only makes it awkward not useless. In 
fact the same can be said of most teenagers.

My first bus  was a 1972 7 passenger bus that became the original 
Westfakia. Frankly, the bus rocked. I was the fastest, best braking, 
best heat, most driven, most useful bus I have owned. Most of my 
really fun bus camping happened in that bus. I put close about 45K on 
before I passed it on to Joel. Who treated it to some new parts and 
yet another Westfalia interior. I did spend some time fussing with 
the Weber/009 combo but WTF it ran cool, fast and got great fuel 
economy - mid 20s. Joel sold the bus over a year ago and it now 
resides in Ohio. The new owner is driving it back the EveryBus this 
year.

The 1972 Euro delivery Westy I only owned for about 6 months. It was 
very cool but I needed cash and sold it.

If you like the bus then buy the bus.
