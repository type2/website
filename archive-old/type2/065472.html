&gt; Hey Folks, 
&gt; I'm having a very small problem with the FI system in my 79 bus I'd
&gt; like to correct.  I live at the bottom of a small hill.  In the a.m.,
&gt; when leaving for work, is when my small problem occurs.
&gt; I start the bus, and release the parking brake, put it in 1st, and let off
&gt; the brake and begin to accelerate.  Problem is it hesitates big time, like
&gt; its about to stall, then regains power.  So, it regains power, I'm in
&gt; 1st gear crawling up the hill, and ready for 2nd gear.

Do you let the poor thing warm up first?  I hesitate in the morning
too...after a couple of cups of Joe, I am usually ready to be put in
gear and tackle the hill.  I always used to follow the Muir
method...start the bus, roll a smoke, light it and take a couple of
long hauls to get it going good...then put the bus in gear.  Of
course, since I no longer roll smokes, I usually go out just in time
for the morning CBC news cast, start the Bus, sip coffee until the
news headlines are over and then put the bus in gear...

I s'pose that if you wanted to be really anal about it, you could time
it out on your watch.


&gt; I put it in 2nd, and it does the stumble thing for 2 seconds, then back to 
&gt; full power.  By this time, I'm up the hill, and going downhill
&gt; in 3rd.  No problems the rest of the day.  Only happens on this hill
&gt; in the a.m..  What gives?  Fuel pump about to give out? Air flow meter
&gt; about to die?
&gt; 

Sound like cold, thick oil...but you may have other problems [you
definitely will have other problems if you are one of these people who
has it &quot;in gear&quot; and is rolling as soon as the engine catches].

Bugs &amp; Things &amp; Splits...Oh, my!

Roy
