Carb cleaner works wonders on cleaning this aluminum up, Berryman's dip can
is the best, but be cautious, it's wicked stuff. I have a small homemade
bead blaster if you have air, that is the absolute best to use inside and
out. If not, carb cleaner (the dip type). As to paint, no way, just clean it
up nicely and let the aluminum shine. If you must paint it, use plain paint,
it should never get hot enough to cause paint to burn in this area.

Subject: [T2] Cleaning a DP Manifold? Oustside and In.

 

I got a used DP MF from Ken at the BusCo. I'm planning to wire brush the

outside , hit it with some primer and spray paint it with High Temp Paint.

 

1.) Is there any reason to use Hi-Temp paint here , I was thinking of just

using some cast aluminum spray paint.

 

2.) Recomenations as to cleaning the inside would be appreciaed... Tips ,

Tricks etc....

 

Thanks
