I went to see my local repair shop today to have the CO etc. checked for and
to have my FI fuel air mixture properly adjusted. They proceeded to tell me
that I needed to replace the boots on the intake manifold to the air
distributor and the vacuum line from the throttle body to the advance on the
dizzy. My problem is when I replaced the vacuum line the little piece for
the hose on the throttle body came off with the old hose, and of course is
not staying in the throttle body with the new hose attached. Any
suggestions?? TIA
