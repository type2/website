&gt;we put this kit together about 6 months ago, it's very nice.
&gt;

This is a neat looking setup and all, and might mount nicely but,
for those on a bit more of a budget not to knock John, a $25 1 wire
sensor (Ron or whoever) a $7 weld in bung (CB Perf, Jegs, whoever)
and a cheapo $25 digital volt meter you already got or should have will
do the same.  You could use a heated 3 wire sensor if you are putting
it way down the exhaust, that would probably be $40 from Ron.  It
will prolong the sensors life but if the exhaust is tight won't be that
much more accurate, just accurate faster with less time to heat up.
You could also do dual single wires right up in the J tubes of a '76-'78
for a real nice way to monitor each bank of 2 seperately but that would
be tough on a '72-'74 or '79-'83 unless you want to pop for 4 sensors.

For a nice look and still cheap Jegs has a 2 1/16&quot; cyberdyne LED
gage for $49 (used to be $39 till a few months ago) and then the
cheap sensor and 15 feet of wire.  All done for under $90 say and
the gage is nice.  Or they sell I think a 3 wire sensor 15 foot harness,
and mounting bung for $90.

Of course you got to look at a Jegs catalog, and all your VW friends
will laugh at you.  Soon you'll be driving a small block Chevy.

For the real inventive types, about $10 in parts can build your own
bargraph LED display and the slick install in a early vanagon is you can
put it in the bottom row of the single center speaker grille in the dash.
I did this on Dolan's looks cool, used the 20 LED version from
Pelican Parts online tech files and modified it down for only one
bar graph driver and 10 LED's.  You could build you own to mount
anywhere in any Bus you could drill the 10 holes.  I mean someday
to look at it again and post the schematic on type2 as I forgot
how I made it, maybe this weekend.  Or just look at the pelican
parts version if you have any electrical knowledge, I don't have much.
