Subject: Throttle linkage

I was on my way to work today when i stepped on the gas and the pedal went
staight to the floor, i reached down and pulled the pedal back up but it did no
good.  The engine stayed revved up and wouldnt stop until i shut off the
engine.  I looked back at the engine and where the cable goes through the
firewall its all frayed but couldnt find a broken spot.  Didnt have enough time
to look at it yet since i was going to be late for work.  Any suggestions on
what to do to fix it.
Thanx brayn72bus
