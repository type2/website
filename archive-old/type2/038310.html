Subject: Everybus - short report

Drove up in the dark.  It rained.
Got there, only casualty was a wiper blade.  It rained.
Camped in the rain.
When it was time to leave the sun came out.
Cooked Breakfast Burritos for 20.  It didn't rain.

Had an absolutely wonderful time, met Nikki (How's Bob?) and many other
listees and chat folks.  It was great.  Even Sherry (builder of great
engines and my wife) had a blast.

Many Kudos to Chris and the Roanoake Valley bus club for putting on a
great event.
