HI all,

Re GEX engines:
I had a lovely '79 Westy a few years ago that had a GEX engine in it. I bought 
it with about 10,000 miles on it. It ran quietly and real well. Unfortunately I 
only had the bus for about another 5,000 miles before it got totalled on a 
hapless cow down in Baja CA. But for 15,000 miles, not a lick of trouble out of 
an apparently very nice rebuilt 2.0L engine.

My old bus mechanic (CB Automotive, Solana Beach CA)
said he'd seen good and bad GEX engines and concluded that they sometimes did 
good work, but definitely had some problems with quality control.

Re recommendations for a good engine:
Sounds like you could get lucky getting one from a big supplier like GEX or 
MOFOCO- or you could get hosed. 

When I needed one, I talked to a couple of shops around the San Diego area and 
found a shop of bad guys who tried to disempower me and convince me I couldn't 
possibly do it myself (so I should pay them bufubucks to do it). I later heard a
horror story about a nice lady who got ripped off by them and ended up in small 
claims court over a &quot;rebuilt&quot; engine.

I heard of an elusive guy who built engines in his garage and did good work, but
I never quite caught up with him. His name was &quot;Bear&quot; and he lived down in
National City somewhere.

Then I found what you need: a really nice guy and good VW machinist named Don 
Bolton who has a machine shop in his home. He does a lot of VW and Porsche 
engines, mostly for dune buggies and racers. He told me I could definitely do it
myself, with his help and guidance. He rebuilt my heads, machined my crankcase 
and crankshaft, made sure I had all the right bearings, rings, cylinders, 
pistons, a gasket set. He was really patient as I picked his brain and rebuilt 
my engine myself for the first time ever. I'd recommend him to anyone.

If you're nowhere near San Diego County, then you need to find a similarly 
endowed machinist near you. And don't let the bad guys tell you you can't do it
yourself, because YOU CAN. If you have a space to work and some time, you can, 
that is... Get a copy of The Idiot Guide, and the VW shop manual, trust 
yourself, and go for it. 

Drive safely,
Surfer Bob
