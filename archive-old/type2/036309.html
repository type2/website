Subject: RE: Accordian Heater Tube

&gt;  there is a white crumbly piece like gasket in accordian tube.
&gt; Anybody replace one of these?


I now have new genuine VW accordion tubes for $19.95 each.  This is brand
new VW stock, not NOS, so I'd be very surprised if it contained any asbestos
(not that I've had one chemically analyzed or anything).
