Subject: Fire &amp; Theft Insurance in Mexico (NONE!!!)

Hi VW brotherhood,

As I am leaving in 10 days for the southern USA and Mexico (well, not 
sure anymore about the last one!), I did some research and reading about 
entering, driving in Mexico, I have learned that American or Canadian 
insurance covering are not valid in Mexico??? Well OK, so I did some 
research and I was told / I found that it was quite easy to take a 
Mexican insurance, BUT!!!!!

I'm pissed!!! Only one insurance company as answered my inquiry about 
covering my bus against theft and fire, none will cover a vehicle older 
than 20 years!!! Here is the answer from www.bajabound_dot_com

 &gt;&gt;&gt;Dear Ben,

We regret to inform you that we cannot offer &quot;full coverage&quot; on your 
1973 Bus, as it is over 20 years old. This is a strict policy that 
cannot be negotiated. Should you still be travelling into Mexico and 
will need &quot;liability coverage&quot; only, we will be available to take your 
order here at Bajabound Insurance Services Inc.

Thanks for your time and understanding.
Sincerely,
Stefan Schermerhorn
Customer Service&lt;&lt;&lt;

Ok, any advice on that matter? (my bus was evaluated at about $5500 USD 
and is fully covered for this amount in the USA &amp; Canada)

Also, I now I need the &quot;Tourist permit&quot; (Permisio) and I think I also 
need a &quot;import car permit&quot;, what else do i need??????????? My judicial 
files, the color of my underwear, the length of my wi$?%%$?%$&amp;!!!!!
Am sorry to ask those questions here but you are the best reliable gang 
on the web!!!!! And I am sure that many of you guys did travel in 
Mexico...with your Bus!

I am surprise to see that it is somewhat complicated to drive and enter 
Mexico; I was thinking that the opposite would be difficult (coming back 
to the USA)

I traveled (driving) a lot in my life in other country and I am very 
surprise about all the fussy side of entering, driving and insurance 
stuff in Mexico.

If you can assure me that nobody will EVEN want to steal a 30 years old 
Bus, well, I will maybe take the chance of going there with only a 
liability coverage, but I don't like it at all!!!!

I don't want to start a thread about the pros &amp; con of getting / driving 
over there so you can p-mail me with any advice you have!!!!
Sorry if this cannot be ask here!

This late news are very deceiving for me, its been month of 
preparation!!! We dont know what to do now!!!!

Well, I could transform my bus in a Brinks Truck and but anti thief 
lock everywhere. I DONT WANT TO HAVE MY BUS STOLEN!!! I have work a lot 
on it!!!

Best regards and thanks for any advice you can give, I need some!!!! Ben
