Subject: Replacing Fuel Pump

Dear all,

I am totally convinced that I have to replace my fuel pump immediately.
Thankyou.

The job looks very easy undo the two bolts and bolt a new one in, 30mins.
Thats the
way it was on my 1600cc. However not is all the same on my 2litre typeIV.

Having looked at the situation, how do you get at the top bolt? Do you have
to remove
the verticle piece of tinware obscuring the top bolt, and if so (oh wise
ones of the list)
how on earth do you remove the top right hand screw securing the tinware
without 
removing the engine.

Secondly the two bolts securing the pump look like M8 spline headed bolts,
however my M8
spline tool is very tight in the head and looks like it will have to be hit
with a hammer
to get snug into the bolt head, is this advisable.  I would like to replace
the bolts with normal 
headed bolts, what type should I use?

I would be gratefull of any suggestions.
