Subject: Re: Whirring noise in back---fuel pump on when?

Welllllll, 
  Unfortunately this is a non satandard bus that I rescued from someones 
yard. There have been many suprises for me since I bought it. Like it wasn't 
really a camper, the engine should have fuel injection,  the fuel system is  
cobbled up...
   However, I love my bus(I may have unconsciously stroked it a few times) 
and these are just small problems in the grand scheme that eventually I'll be 
able to fix. Someday it will be back to it's original state. That means 
engine top and a few sheetmetal repairs and especially a paint job.
Keep on Bussing
