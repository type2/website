Hello All - 

I'm new to the list and immediately wished I'd checked it out earlier as I
did the exact same thing described below. Unfortunately, things are not yet
all OK, as I can't get the bus to start. It's a '77 2.0 liter FI, all hoses
hooked up, all electrical connections complete and grounded, timing done,
valves adjusted, new fuel, fuel pump operational, etc. The bus cranks fine,
starts to start, and just as I am congratulating myself, it dies. I suspect
the cold start valve, but I thought I would ask for suggestions before
beginning detailed troubleshooting. I recently acquired a VOM to test the FI
system, but I'm hoping it's something simple that I've missed. Any help
greatly appreciated.

I got the bus started last week and then had a major oil leak. I determined
it was the oil cooler. I did not have time to pull the engine and trouble
shoot - too much work/work. So I brought it to a local mechanic. Turns out I
put washers on the case side of the studs for the oil cooler. Rookie mistake
I guess - other wise everything seems OK.
