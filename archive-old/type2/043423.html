This fits 74-79 bus or pickup and is the 49-state version (no unleaded fuel
restrictor). I am not sure if or how it could be modified to work on pre-74
busses, but they do have a different filler setup (as noted above). The neck
would work on California busses, although as someone noted, without the
unleaded restrictor it may not pass the visual inspection. (Then again, what
does California expect you to do if the &quot;proper&quot; California-only one is
simply not available at all?)

Joe responded:

What California expects for you to do is install the proper one, which is a 119A instead of a 119.
The difference is the 'restrictor' in the filler neck which prohibits the larger 'leaded' gas nozzle from being inserted.
Never mind that leaded fuel is not available in California, never mind that this part is unavailable, never mind that a perfectly good 1979 bus cannot be licensed or driven without this unobtanium part. Grrrr.

My mechanic has a 1979 bus that cannot leave. It is now in bus limbo. (Hey! that would make a good name for a club!).
His customer is, as you would expect, not at all pleased. If it goes up for sale, I will get a one-day trip permit and move it out of state or scrap it for parts. Seems a darn shame.

The original intention of the smog law was grand (Witness the difference in air quality between LA in 1980 and LA today)
but this is surely not what Nordhoff had in mind. On the other hand, my 1971 Westy is inspection-free, and I could put any old filler neck in it if I so cared. (Which I don't, my bus has all of the proper smog stuff on it, minus the
charcoal filter)
