Subject: Re: [T2] Part Number Help? Can't find it.

Once again Richard. Thank you very much. If ever I am on the West Coast or 
within a few hundred miles I will definately have to look you up and buy you 
a few rounds. If there is anything I can ever do let me know. Your help has 
been invaluable.

Best Reguards,

Michael Knight
