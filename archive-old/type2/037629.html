&gt; I have no idea about the plug mentioned(actually I
&gt; think I do...I'll get to

&gt; distributor is not advancing, or a
&gt; vacuum leak.  Unless you have a Cr_at_ppy 009, look (I
&gt; mean listen) for a vacuum
&gt; leak between the distributor and the carb. Check to
&gt; see that the line(both if
&gt; present) are corrected. 

I agree with the distributor not advancing properly,
but it could also be a problem with the distributor
itself, as well as a vacuum leak... I had a similar
problem that was cured with a new distributor.

And yes, I use a &quot;crappy&quot; .009 ;-) Not to start
another Holy-War here, but in an upright motor that is
properly tuned, a .009 works just fine. I have *zero*
problems with the .009 in my '69 Westy (1600sp),
including the notorious &quot;lag&quot; that some people
experience from a dead stop. 

Also, compare the price of a new .009 at $50.00 to a
new vac-advance at (Gee, I dunno....I'd have to *find*
one first;-)... I think you see my point! *If* you can
find the proper vac-advance distributor (new), you're
easily talking 4-5 times the price of a .009.... Is it
worth it? Not in my book...
