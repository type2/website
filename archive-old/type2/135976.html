Subject: [T2]oil coming from dipstick ????

ok i have located the oil spilage from the dipstick after a week long research on cleaning and fixing my oil filler cap which i thought indeed it has been coming from but hasnt...~!~
once again i cleaned up late last night and drove a mile up the road this morn and there is deffinetly oil coming from the dipstick...
the rubber boot has been changed (dipstick boot) and the area around the dipstick has been cleaned throughly and i can see it running (flow line ) under the dipstick rod..from looking at it with engine bay door open......?
 
now my friend phil says that there shouldnt be any oil coming from this area and if so there isnt a negative pull or positive pull on the engine right&gt;? cant remember which it was...?
phil if you see this tell me again..?
 
i cant seem to figure out whats going on here...?
i know for sure that its not the oil filler cap now though cause i have it fixed on right and its deffinelty coming from the dipstick its self...
 
only other test i was going to do which wil be later on will be i am going to take the dipstick out completely and cap off the hole for the dipstick and then see if there is any oil coming out..? that will tell me if it is coming from inside the metal tube or out the area where the dipstick meets the metal tube...?
 
anyone ever been through this..?
can someone give me a hand here please..
its causeing a great big ole mess,....
i am loosing anywheres from 1/4 quart of oil to 1/2 qaurt of oil each time i drive it say 1 mile to 5 miles...?
its spraying all over the back of the bus as well..
not to mention it is running all out on the belly of the tin under the fan ....
 
i am running a weber progresive and 76 engine 79 tranny..
i have a new line running from the oil breather also to the weber carb top.. so that it has the right pressure on it... also for its worth it seems i have lost some power again..? or maybe...?but i think that i may have ..?hard to say ... depends at times i guess... hills and such,..
peace and love
chris
