Well, the last one I came across  that failed gave warning by having
the engine die and the bus come to a stop.  Not a happy situation for
the people involved!

Others can start to give a weak spark, resulting in hard starting.

In any case, the problem is easily diagnosed by replacing the coil
with a spare.  If the symptom goes away, the coil is bad!  A coil is
one of those things you should keep in the spares box.
