Subject: More heater options
Message-ID: &lt;381A1299.BB7EF775_at_earthlink_dot_net&gt;

I was at a junkyard today and saw an RV propane heater installed in a
cupboard under the closet in a 1974 Safaré camper. It was 7&quot;w x 13&quot;h and
I couldn't tell how deep it was because I couldn't get it out (I tried).
It had a little information plate in it identifying it as an RV LPG
furnace and specifying clearances.

Just an interesting tidbit to toss out there.
