&gt; pressure to the injectors with the fuel pump off.  One test for this
&gt; part is to turn the key to on and allow the fuel pump to build pressure
&gt; for a few seconds prior to engaging the starter.
&gt; 
Everyone with FI please remember that turning the key on does not run the
fuel pump.  The fuel pump does not run until the key is turned to the
&quot;start&quot; position.  That's why the system needs to hold pressure when the
pump is off for rapid starts later.

You can manually run the pump with the key on if you'd like by moving the
flap inside the air flow meter by hand.  There are other ways but that's
the easiest as it doesn't involve playing around with the wiring :-)
