Subject: Re: [T2] Re: Engine downgrades (a touch long)

&gt; So.....these &quot;off the shelf&quot; engine parts that
&gt; are available at foreign FLAPS are designed,
&gt; machined, and built to the same specs as the
&gt; type 4 (or comparable quality type 1) parts
&gt; that must be mail ordered?  
&gt; 
&gt; Hmmmmm, I always suspected there was really
&gt; nothing to that that Gene Berg mystique!

Well, I don't know.  I believe Gene Berg's policy
is that they never have and never will make Type
4 parts.
