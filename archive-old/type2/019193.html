Subject: THE MOTHERSHIP IS BACK!!!!(it's the points baby)
Message-ID: &lt;382C4DD6.227AE7E2_at_gte_dot_net&gt;

Hello all
	just got in from messing with the points on my bus (that hasn't ran for
about a week.....)then turned the key and zoom!!! there she starts!!
the points are still adjusted poorly but she starts.....tonight i'll try
to use/figure out my newly purchased tach/dwell meter, and set them
correctly....does anyone have suggestions on doing this??? it seems to
me that growing a third arm would help in setting the points....but that
may take me a while and i would probably have to go on a hight protein
diet ....but i'm just talking nonsence here right now  ;)

thanks for all the help in advance
later
ericd
