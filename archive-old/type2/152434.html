Subject: Ride height

Don't worry, this post is not about &quot;slamming&quot; or similar occupation.

The rear end of the 71 westy seems to be sagging but I do not know
what it should be like stock.  I did not find any height measurement
in Bentley.

From the top of the rim lip to the lower part of the wheel well, there
is 2.16 inch (5.5 cm) on the right side and 2.55 inch (6.5 cm on the
left side). I did not measure that on the front, unfortunately. It
seems to me that the front is at the stock height. The bus's front is
clearly higher than the back.


I do not know if the rear wells are the same from 68 to 79 or only
from 68 to 71.

Could someone with a 68-71 or 68-79 with stock rear height measure the
distance between the rim lip and wheel well ?

Thanks in advance !
