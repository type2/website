Subject: Propane heater, electric defroster

&gt;        I wouldnt recommend an electric heater or any other major 12 volt
&gt;power consumer for your bus.  Gas heat is the way to go.  What I did was go
&gt;to Walmart and get one of those screw on single dish type radiating
&gt;adapters for the small propane containers.  I think I paid under $15.  Not
&gt;only do I use it while camping but also just on the way to work in the
&gt;bitter Winter time.  Works great.  It heats the bus up faster than the
&gt;wifey's F$RD.  How many T2'ers out there can say that they wouldnt be so
&gt;proud to have their SO ask to sit in your bus until their car warms up?

I like the general idea but:  the tank should be rigidly mounted in the
event of an accident.  Also, such heaters do produce some carbon monoxide
and require positive ventilation.  If yer bus is anything like mine,
ventilation isn't a problem...

On the cheap electric defrosters:  I'm sure they ain't worth $_at_*# for
defrosting, but how are they at defogging?  Is it better just to keep a
squeegee close at hand?
