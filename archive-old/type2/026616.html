Hi Volks,

oabout a week ago I promised to deliver details on the conversion 
how-to for VW inline-four engines in Baywindow buses.

Well, the how-to is available for DM 125.  This may seem high, but 
there's lots of experimenting incorporated in there, and the guy 
(Jens Pöplow) has no day-time job, he's just living off mocking with 
buses.  Anyway, it's 25 pages, illustrated, and German only for the 
time being.

Sufficient interest provided, we're gonna prepare an English version. 
Also, the price includes a free e-mail hotline (i.e., you mail me, I 
ask him, I mail you).  Anyone interested, p-mail me please.

Yours,
    Erik.
