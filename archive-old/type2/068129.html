Subject: Inside Condensation

I spend *alot* of time in my (heated) camper: how can I control the 
rivers of condensation flowing down my windows?

I provide a moderate exchange of air via a small fan in the floor vent, 
but I haven't designed an intricate pre-heated fresh air intake duct as 
Bob Hoover outlined in one of his sermons...

Does anyone have any other suggestions (besides a towel)?
