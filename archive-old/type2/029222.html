Dear All:

 I can't find anyone locally with GL 4 tranny lube and couldn't find
anything on the web that sold Redline (which appeared to be the list
recommendation)  Bus Depot doesn't have any listed in their web catalog,
Vintage Bus Archive didn't show a vendor, NAPA no...

Anyone have a name and number to call?

Thanks and have a great Memorial Day weekend!

- Brian
