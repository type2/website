&gt; I've been looking for models and stuff of that scale of a 76'ish bus. Just something to paint in various color schemes to see what I really like. Has anyone seen any toys or models of such buses? All I can seem to find is Splitties, and Panels.

if you find one let the list know, I've been looking for one for years
