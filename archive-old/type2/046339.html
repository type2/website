Subject: [T2] BN-2 heater Help?

Hi Volks,

I picked up a Eberspacher BN-2 heater at a swap meet this summer, and am
hoping to get it working and installed before I have to ground Das
Über-Kamper on account of window defrosting/life sustaining heat capability.

Yes, I'm a wimp,  but I want to go camping on Thanksgiving weekend (2 weeks
from today for us Canucks!) and my wife and three kids do appreciate some
creature comfort. I expect to install it under the van between the frame
rails and replacing the heater pipe that comes forward from the heater
boxes. This was a stock placement in late-model Canadian Westy's and with
the BN-4 it won't reduce ground clearance.

I checked the  type2_dot_com library, but the only BN-2 reference is a photo of
a heater that is a lot more primitive than mine.

Wiring diagrams would be greatly appreciated. I still have the switchgear
from the BN-4 from my 73 westy but I have no idea how to hook it up.

I have posted pics of my heater at

and http://www.geocities_dot_com/gord-potts/BN-2side.JPG

THANKS!!

Happy trails,
