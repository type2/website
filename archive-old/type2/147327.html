how the heck am i supposed to be able to get a screw driver on the clamp 
to loosen it?  The clamp doesn't seem to twist at all, and what my 
fingers tell me is the screw head is wedged into the corner where my 
little stubby screwdriver won't reach!


i'm starting to think i'll have to remove the firewall and go about this 
from the other end by removing the fill tube from the tank and then 
removing the clamp and replacing the neck.  oh well.  it looks like the 
neck will have to wait until i have the fill tube as well.

think smarter, work easier
