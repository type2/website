Subject: Re: [BSKA] to turn or not to turn... was: good news, bad news

ok, i was told a while ago, that you need to turn the drums when you
replace the shoes or the grooves will wear the new shoes out faster...
true? or not?

then, more recently, i was told that it would be difficult to get the
drum over the new shoes if i dont get them turned because of the depth of
the lip... if the lip isnt too bad, then it isnt as big a problem... true
or not? and at like $100 each, i cant afford to buy new ones... so if no
one can tell me why i SHOULD have them turned, i guess i will just
reinstall them as is (with a new grease seal, installed CORRECTLY~and i
wont let my ex do it this time...) with a quick sanding to remove the
slick.

anyway, thanks guys,
chris
