Subject: Bad vibes

We're leaving for the west coast Sunday, so of course Mrs. M., the worlds
lovliest &amp; crankiest 82 Westy is at it again.

Specifically, a vibration in the steering wheel that comes and goes.  It can
be gone for a looong time, and return without warning.  It did this morning,
as I rounded a curve on the hiway east of town.  It only can be noticed at
55-58+ mph.

I've checked, 2 different garages have checked.  Nobody found nuthin'.

The tires are all new, brakes are new.  Shocks aren't new, but appear OK.  

You don't feel the vibration thru the floor, seat, etc., only thru the
steering wheel.  This began about 8,000 miles back.  It's a little more
intense now than it was at first.  (Or else my fear of screaming over the
edge of a pass in Wyoming is making it more intense...)

Any clues?  Is it worth worrying about?  Or should I just go have a beer and
a snooze?  BTW, the van has 155K--to my knowledge all the
suspension/steering is original.
