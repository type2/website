Subject: [T2] RE: [VB] A B C/Jerome, oops

I guess I should have read the rest of the news letter from A B C, the
donation wasn't $6000.00 but $5000.00 and the charity wasn't the burn camp
but an animal shelter.

Sorry for an confusion or missunderstandings, I stand corrected.

Subject: [VB] A B C/Jerome


I would like to take this Friday to personally thank the Arizona Bus Club
for the great show they put on in Jerome last month and to compliment them
and all the bus (and others) people that helped make this show a FANTASTIC
success, for they're donation was $6000.00 to the burn camp for kids this
year (according to the recent news letter), which couldn't have been done
without all attending generosity and caring. You see it goes beyond who has
and drives what as to who we can all help. I hope at next years Buses by the
Bridge V  can raise half as much as they did, we donate the proceeds to
Abused Children's Home and raised $2300.00 for them last year. Hope to see
you all in January 19th-21, 2001 at BBB V.

Ronnie   old volks of az.
