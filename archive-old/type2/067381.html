kinda similar thing happened to me a few weeks ago.  a guy back in the
woods a few towns from me has 10 baywindows in his yard, including 3
single cabs (ULTRA rare in new jersey!). unfortunately, the old man is
senile.  i went to his place to ask about selling parts, or even whole
buses.  he said he would only sell one... a 76 or so
westy-rust-bucket-from-hell (trying hard not to plagiarize Rusty :)  )
it had:         no floors (rusted out)
                engine fire
                cracked glass all around
                mildew interior.

said he couldn't let go of it for less than $10,000  (that's not a
misprint).  i picked my jaw off the ground, thanked him, and left.
senility is strange.
