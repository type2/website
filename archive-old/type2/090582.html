Subject: Re: [T2] Multimeter recommendations please

Actron is having a blowout sale on their Sunpro CP7676 Engine Analyzer
(Dwell, RPM, VDC, Ohms, Diode).

$79.99 retail reduced to $14.95 + $5 SH.  I searched around on the web and
this basic model was usually about $60-70 online.  It's new but they are
just reducing inventory because they have introduced new models.
...

Great geal. I dont need it and Im going to get one anyway.
