Subject: Re: [T2] Long Mirror (Posted after searching the archives!)

From: &quot;Mike&quot; &lt;jester_at_cfnson_dot_com&gt;
&gt; Questions:
&gt; 1. My bus' mirror stem is about 3.5&quot; (approx. 89mm) from the
forward-facing
&gt; edge of the mounting flange to where the ball enters the mirror itself.
Is
&gt; this the large-sized stem, or one of the smaller ones?
&gt; 2. ... is it possible to disassemble the mirror for repairs...
&gt; 3. What prevents the long stem from being installed in some buses?

Answered #2 for myself, as the major parts of the mirror assembly are now
set out neatly on the counter.  The night glare adjustment mechanism is a
bit different than I expected, but not entirely impossible to replace.  Not
sure what the little friction disk in the cup is made from, but it appears
to be pressed natural rubber (?).

The sun damage to the black mirror housing is severe.  The surface is
crumbling off with only moderate finger rubbing.  A few more years, and it
would probably be toast.

I can replace all of the parts (except for the glass, of course!) with resin
reproductions, though I'm not sure how many times one could remove the
mirror from the bus before the three &quot;teeth&quot; on the resin stem wore too
much.

Does anyone know if the ball bit on the stem is the same size from mirror to
mirror, regardless of stem length?

Still, if nothing else, managing to get the mirror out of the housing in one
piece was a trip...
