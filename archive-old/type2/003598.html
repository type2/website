If the cut is directly over the gas tank, they did it to replace the fuel
level sending unit without having to pull the engine.

Subject: [T2] Why did they cut my bus?


&gt; In the rear compartment of my 1973 Bus, immediately behind the rearmost
seat
&gt; someone has cut three sides of a square into the floor panel. This is in
the
&gt; panel that forms the top of the engine compartment. The cut is in the
center
&gt; and about 6 to 8 inches on a side. They didn't actually remove the metal.
&gt; They just made a really sloppy cut. Several of the buses I've looked at
(all
&gt; baywindows) have this same cut.
&gt;
&gt; Does anyone know why the cut was made? Can it be repaired? What is the
best
&gt; way to repair it?
