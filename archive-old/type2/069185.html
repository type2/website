Subject: The Beam, part 4 or so..

WEll, its Tuesday, noon or so, and here is what has happened so far...

Sunday, After the setstrike:
Lets se..tried to disconnect the clutch cable from the pedal, just to 
find out a: that it was installed UNDER the hole, instead of through the 
hole in the frame it was supposed to be installed through &lt;and, it has 
been cuttting its way up! which expains why i couldnt keep it adjusted 
right..the tension kept changing..&gt;
and B: the pin that holds it in, was installed BACKWARD! the side with 
the c-clip was on the side you cant get to!!! &lt;scream!!&gt;

so, after removing the whole pedal assemble, i then had to remove the 
whole cable, so i can thread it through the proper hole..
Hmm..the damper on my new beam is leaky, and the one on my old beam is 
dead, as are the shocks...&lt;phhhhzt! and they are up, and they dont come 
back down on their own..:&gt;

Tryed to revmove the drag link thingie, just to realize i need a puller 
after all.

Monday:

Go to rent a puller, and they hand us this awful looking wedge sortof 
device that i KNOW a: wont fit up there, and two, will tear the boot, so, 
i hand it back, and we decide to try the pitman arm piller...it turns out 
to be just a tad to big..

While sitting around with nothing to do, while dad is at work, and then 
getting the gear puller, i start starting at the cancer..

Now, i love her, she runs great,the eninge is in tiptop shape &lt;once i 
finish the tune up&gt;, but...

she isnt structurally sound anymore. The rust isnt just her body anymore 
First the beam, and now...the frame members have cracks, and holes..arg!!!
Not sure yet whwhat i'll do, but, dad is gonna get the welder from work, 
and i guess that we will rig something to hold her together.

Dad gets home witht he gear puller&lt;works vERY well.._dot_used it all of three 
tmes..once on the drag link thingie, and twice removoing a stillgood 
tierod from the old beam &lt;just in case&gt;&gt;
He also looked for the stuff someguy on the vanagon list mentioned using 
on his ball joints, to refurbish the boots. A self curing rubber tape. He 
didnt mention that it comes in rolls of 1 inchX55ft, and costs ~60$'s!! wow..

i guess we will comeup with something else to rebuild the boots..

We go hit up the locl &lt;harrisonville&gt; autoparts stores for a damper and 
shocks..The sutozone hasnt opened yet, so we go to O'Reillys, thy can 
order them..about 1 week to get them..Then NAPA...they dont carry them..
oh, Oreillys had listed: 69 Vanagon. closes they had to a bus....pathetic.

We got the old beam off finially, after it hung on the pass. metal brake 
line.. &lt;woops..no wonder that side was hard to get off..:)


tuesday:

Head into town..after calling Westerauto and sitting on hold for 24 
minutes, then giving up...
Stop by western auto &lt;righ next to the bank dad has to stop by..&gt;
They can get the shocks, will take 1.5 to two weeks. i laugh and walk 
out..dont even carry the damper..

Drop dad off at work, come to the apartment, and call Goodmans Auto 
Parts. 
Guy on the pphone says &quot;doesnt sound to hard..&quot; then gives me a 
price..18$'s ech ofr shocks, and 24.97 for the damper.. the i ask, are 
they in stock..he says: no..but when do you need them.
I says: Today..accually, yesterday.
Then he says: Tell ya what. Let me call you back.

He calls back: I cna have them for you by 3, no later than 4 today!

So, at 4, i'll have them!:)

and then i wote this...


.......david&lt;wishing the keys worked everytime i pressed them..&gt;
