Hi Dan,
 
Can you forward this to the wetwesties list?  Egroups keeps
bouncing my mail &amp; I'm trying to figure out why with my isp
&amp; them--anyway, I have finally decided to sell my bus, so
here is all the info.  I appreciate you passing this on for
me until I get this problem with my mail resolved.
 
Hope all is well with you,
 
Yours,

Subject: FS: 1975 CAMPER CONVERSION BUS, WAAAAAAAHHHH!!


 
  
Well folks, after 6 months of going back and forth trying
to devise ways to keep my bus for camping trips, I've
decided in the best interest of my business (starving
artist don't ya know): and the fact that I have no garage
or carport, I need to sell Da Badda Bing (formerly Old
Yeller).  I bought the bus for local camping only around
puget sound, &amp; have only put 1700 miles on it since I've
owned it (1998).
 
The camper has ice box (including the elusive top rack),
sink (I can't get pump to work, but that doesn't
necessarily mean much:), full pop top, canvas in good shape
but does need small screen for front. Has JVC am/fm casette
player with front &amp; rear speakers. It also needs foam
mattress for the z-ish bed, (we used a self-inflating air
mattress).  Some very small rust spots are developing along
front windshield, so needs to be touched up soon. 
Headliner is in great condition.
 
This is a great camper  &amp; it runs great, still lots of time
for camping yet this summer! 
 
I've tried to list all attributes below, please email me
off list at lori_at_labellestudios_dot_com if you have any
questions.
 
*1975 Camper Conversion (conversion done by Country Homes
Camper in CA, very much like the ASI conversions)
*Bought from Rudy Schaffner at Shaffner Motors VW
Restoration in Edmonds, WA May 1998: mileage: 152,263
*All mechanicals &amp; electrical, brakes, etc. were completely
restored by Schaffner, (including fuel lines) 
*The bus comes with a chronicalogical list of Ownership
Transition (transfers) with mileage on  VW letterhead 
*Engine replaced with Tom Noble 2 litre long block at
140,050 miles, odometer presently:   153,951, so 13, 901
miles on engine
(New clutch installed with the engine)
 
Things I've contributed:
*New battery
*70 amp Bosch alternator (for eventual auxilliary battery)
*Regulator
 
I will throw in:
Bentley manual
Muir manual
some metric tools
volt/tach/dwell meter
snow chains
voltage tester
 
Asking: $6200.00, I should note that I tried to get
Schaffner down from his price of $6500 when I bought it &amp;
he wouldn't budge (and I'm a pretty d**ned good haggler)
