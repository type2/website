Subject: Re: [T2] Is airconditioning a good idea in stock 71 Westy?


&gt; &gt; engine, horse power and the engine life? I am also curious if one were
to
&gt; &gt; put the ac in, how would they connect the duct into stock Westy?
_____________
&gt; There was no factory option that I know of, but there was a
&gt; dealer-installed system with a self-contained evaporator/blower/fan that
&gt; either went under the dash or against the ceiling behind the driver.
&gt;
&gt; These systems were rather Rube Goldberg in design,. but they did work
&gt; after a fashion.  I live in SoCal, and don't really think the hassle of
&gt; rounding up the parts and installing them is worth it.
&gt;

I'm not sure how this plays into the parts you are talking about, but the
'70 camper that I am buying this weekend has one that is behind the driver
on the ceiling... and has parts that are currently disconnected in the back
driver's side engine compartment.  I was hoping to find something out there
aftermarket...  I know that there are kits for some hot rods, but the real
question is fitting, and horsepower loss.

Anyone seen these for VW?
