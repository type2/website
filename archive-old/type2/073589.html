A major reason that VW went to dual port was for fuel injection......And
smog requirements...

I feel it was the worst move they made, I love single ports, and thats the
only thing I will build for a Bus, other than a type IV...

&gt; &gt; I believe VW went to dual port to meet emission standards.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Single port provides slightly higher low end torque because of the
&gt; &gt; higher velocity of the air fuel mixture as it enters the cylinders.
&gt;
&gt; I think that VW had to go to dual port to flow enough mixture after the
&gt; displacement increase to 1600.  Keep in mind that the same basic head
&gt; design had been used from 1200 through 1500, and there wasn't enough metal
&gt; left to make the holes bigger.  Since they had to make a casting change
&gt; anyway, they went all the way to the dual port design.
&gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Single port heads are not subject to
&gt; all the cracking that you find &gt; in dual port heads.
&gt;
&gt; I'm not sure that the cracking worries apply to the long-reach plug dual
&gt; port heads.  Anybody have any data on the long-reach heads?
&gt;
&gt; &gt; Single port provides more engine access especially when changing
&gt; &gt; number 1 and 3 spark plugs.
&gt;
&gt; Very true.  They also make it easier to seat the spark plug boots.  On
&gt; dual port tin, you have to be careful to get the boots behind the manifold
&gt; nuts.
