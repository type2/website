&gt; It sound like one of the key issues with the heater booster is the amperage
&gt; draw - it is this that limits how often/how long the heater is used when
&gt; parked ie camping.  So what is the draw in real terms?  On a fully charged
&gt; auxillaru battery how long can one of these units run?  I know there are a
&gt; 
couple hours

&gt; And how many times can you run via timer from main battery?

once, per setting, in other words you have to set it each time you use it,
but it will run until you have no more power at all.

&gt; I'm just trying to get some idea of the amount of use I can get from this
&gt; unit when camping.  I'm wondering if I'm still going to want to install a
&gt; propane rv heater.

they put out huge quantities of heat, so 15 minutes every 2 hours might be
enough except on the coldest nights
