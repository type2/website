Subject: Rebuild kit 4 2000

Just as the sun sets so does gloom always follow this poor 
&quot;loooooser&quot;......, got the FI system straightened out on my '78 (elvis) 
only to find the valves are shot in one head. So I need to find the best 
deal  on a complete rebuild kit for it, it comes out - it goes back 
rebuilt......
   also......
 my '73 is shot too and needs a rebuild...but Since I have another 2000, 
I am thinking of rebuilding it and putting it in the '73 instead of the 
1700....pros-cons? goods-bads?
       

                                            Thanks,
                                         scott in N.C.
