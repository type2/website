Subject: Re: [T2] Water Injection

&gt;Water injection does not increase horsepower directly.

	Sorry Phil  -  this is not correct.  Please do read my article at
http://www.kuratrading_dot_com/HTMLArticles/writings.htm


&gt;  It allows you to run more timing with the same octane
&gt;fuel without detonation.

	True; but it also gives you more power &amp;/or economy (by 
burning the fuel more thoroughly) even with std timing.
