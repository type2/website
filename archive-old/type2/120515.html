&gt; There's no such thing as a cheap bus. All buses end up costing about

what do you mean it takes money to get a bus ready. I bought my split
for $1800.....
oh yea that new engine that didn't have a broken bearing mount.
then there was that tranny that didn't want to stay in gear.
tie rods and so that it stayed on the road.
brakes so it stopped before going off the road.
that clutch thing so it goes again.

can I take back what I just said :)
but I sure enjoy it now!!!
