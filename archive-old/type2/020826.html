i asked a custom exhaust shop this and they sent me packing..they couldn't
duplicate the connection to the head without doing lesser quality work than
they were willing to. i am much happier with my heat exchangers i
scrounged/bought

&gt; Hey. I'm thinking of getting the local national chain exhaust shop to
&gt; make me some J-tubes for my 77's stock exhaust.
&gt; Anybody else had any experience with this type of cheating?
