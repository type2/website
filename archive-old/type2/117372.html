the auto tranny should not leak......

&gt; At least one of the Auto-Bay owners I know replaces the gasket every 
&gt; spring, but it still leaks by mid-summer. Is this a design flaw in the 
&gt; tranny or a problem with the gasket?  I'm told the gasket is just 
&gt; paper, but I haven't seen one in person.

which &quot;gasket&quot; are you talking about???  the torque convertor seal is
about the only thing that gets changed on a regular basis, and I change
mine when ever the engine is out....the seals are (were) avaliable from
the bus depot for a couple bucks.

 the biggest &quot;trick&quot; with the seals is that you DON'T seat them but rather
they only go in until the front is flush with the housing.  they are BTW
rubber/metal seals but can be easily damaged and I have gotten bad ones
right out of the box so I always buy two and check em carefully for cracks
before installing them
