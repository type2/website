Listers:

Every once in a while, someone will post to the list inquiring about white wall tires for vintage VW's.  We know Coker (sp?) makes them, but are sometimes hard to get.  I found another web site that makes retro-looking tires for not only VW's, but also red-striped tires that would fit 60's muscle cars.  Anyway, here's the link if any body's looking for white walls:

For bugs:

For Busses:

The web site doesn't show the load rating on these tires, so they may not work on a bus.  Call the 800 number to ask what the specs are.
