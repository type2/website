&gt;So I mounted my spare battery today with the relay kit from bus depot.  What

&gt;Is there a problem with that?  Someone said that there was ... but if so ... 
&gt;what is it?

Don knows the answer to this. :-)

If you hook up to the alternator blue wire then the relay will only close if the alternator is running. If the alternator fails for some reason in your proposed setup, I suppose the batteries will be in an enternal struggle trying to charge each other while trying to run the rest of the electrics w/o the alternator.
