Subject: Re: [T2] Nice California Westy

I own several Westfalia brochures from 1972 and 1973.

I shall list all designations here:

In my folders of 1972 and 1973 the spare tire is always inside and not on
the front of the bus under the cover! I know for sure that the Helsinki
models of later years do have that front covered spare tire there.

Düsseldorf with kitchen sink cabinet without clothing cabinet but with
bottom drawer for emergency folding spare tire (no spare tire inside bus);
clothing cabinet instead of spare tire inside.

Malaga with kitchen sink cabinet and clothing cabinet with mirror; spare
tire inside

Offenbach with as malaga but with clothing rack instead of spare tire;
emergency folding spare tire in bottom of clothing rack

Madrid with seat opposite to the sliding door; table in the middle; sink at
the sliding door; multipurpose cabinet along the sliding door side towards
back end, spare tire inside

Helsinki just like Madrid but without multipurpose cabinet along the sliding
door side towards back end;

Berlin (1977) has a reversible passenger seat and the sink cabinet behind
the drivers seat; table in the middle; spare tire on the nose of the
vehicle; alongside the driver side backwards from the sink cabinet are
multiple cabinets

Luxemburg (in the US known as Campmobile 70)with seat behind the drivers
seat facing backwards; table on the drivers side; sink cabinet at the
sliding door; multipurpose cabinet along the sliding door side towards back
end; spare tire inside

Mosaik is a camping kit you can build out and in the bus when needed. So all
is ready to unbolt and take out.
In 1972 it didnt include a sink and cooking unit. only seats and tables
ready to convert to a bed. the seat was placed behind the drivers seat and
the table opposite to the sliding door.
The 1973 Mosaik was completed with a sink and cooking unit. They were placed
at the sliding door and the rest of the interior was not changed.
The Mosaik SO72/7 included a multipurpose cabinet along side the sliding
door side towards the back end.
The Mosaik SO 72/8 had nu such multipuprose cabinet and had a wider sleeping
area.



Hope you get an idea with these explanations. You can always use a search
engine and look for the westfalia designations there.

&gt; It is a non-poptop Westy. Westfalia made 3 models:
&gt; P-21 has no poptop. Has sink, cooler, bed in back, main table in rear,
childs
&gt; cot in front.
&gt; P-22 has poptop. All of above, and bed in top.
&gt; P-27 is the deluxe Westy. All of the above plus 2 burner stove, fridge
instead
&gt; of cooler, front table, storage container/stool between front seats.

Thanks Karl. I also wondered where the stool and front table.

My Canadian model's m-plate says P22. It seems it's the same as the US model
but it has the original stove.

&gt; That 77 has a few things wrong:
&gt; It is white, appears to be originally white because the front interior is
&gt; white. Pastel white is correct for the 77 P-21 Westy. But the green plaid
is
&gt; wrong. Supposed to be yellow plaid. The yellow curtains are correct.
&gt; Not sure about the &quot;signature edition&quot; headliner......

It looks yellow to me, like my own cloth.

The 76 dealer brochure seems to call this Orange Plaid while 77 dealer
brochure calls it Green Red.  I think it's the same fabric as long as it has
the red stripe in the pattern.

I emailed Vincent Molenaar a while back and he said the European models had
names like Helsinki.  Does anyone know all the names and what they
designate?
