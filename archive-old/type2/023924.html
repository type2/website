&gt;I realize I could just take off maybe my radio block off plate or
&gt;something and the paint store could match the colour but I can't believe
&gt;that 40 year old paint hasn't faded at least some.  I would rather have
&gt;a formula for the original.

The problem you're facing is even if you *did* have an old formula book,
the paint materials themselves have changed, evolving significantly over
the past 40 years.  In order for those formulas to work, you would also
have to have the original base, tints, reducers, etc, too.  

Paint companies don't really have a sound business case to keep generating
formulaes for old paint.  How much of it do they really sell?  They'll sell
20 times as much paint for 1995 Hondas as they would for all VW buses
combined.

when my 65 westy was painted I found a paint shop that had recipes for the
colours I needed (velvet green/bluewhite).   (PPG brand) They were mixed to
the recipe....BUT the white came out wrong and had to be remixed and reprayed.
The green is a tad too light.    you can have a mindspin looking at colours,
seeing fractional differences in shades.   Anyway, it came out allright.   The
quality of the paint job depends on the prep work.    And check out your nose,
there always seems to be a billion tiny rock chips there.
