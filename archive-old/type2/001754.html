I installed a Tiger 581 CDI today in my fuel injected '72.  (the FI is from
an '83).  We were not able to get my injectors to fire in CDI mode.  Using a
scope we found we were getting what seemed to be good signal, but would not
fire them.  We determined that the signal was too clean and the ECU needed
more of a spike to work.  So we ended up using a second coil to create the
signal for the injectors. It works, but is not real pretty.

My question is how have you dealt with this problem? especially on a early
eighties FI.


Thanks
