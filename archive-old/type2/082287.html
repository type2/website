In a Rav 4 coming across the country, I averaged 1,000 miles per day at about 
12-14 hrs. Made Cali in four from Boston. Did approx. 800 a day in my friends 
76 once, but only for about 3 days, as that was not a xross country trip. 500 
would be fairly easy in a bus. I think yhat would bring you around 9 or 10 
hrs. driving. But I would also be willing to play with those #s depending on 
terrain. If it's summer, and it's 90 degrees out, and your climbing some 
mountain pass, I would let your bus rest alot sooner. Try to drive more 
mileage on the flats, and much less in the mountains, where your bus is 
really working.
