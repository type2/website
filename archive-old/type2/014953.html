&gt;Yeah, you know...it doesn't matter what type of compass I put in my van, it
&gt;always points West. 

	The compass on the dash in my '74 Westy poptop  worked just fine but there
was one place crossing a freeway bridge where it would spin like a motor,
at every crossing.  It would just take off and whirl like that until we
were off the bridge, always thought there must be some heavy electrical or
phone wiring using the bridge as conduit across the water. It is on
Interstate 5 going north over Bataquitos Lagoon, I was commuting from San
Diego to a project by LAX about twice a week. That compass was a cheapie
and finally the mount croaked... I have not replaced it...might get a GPS!!
