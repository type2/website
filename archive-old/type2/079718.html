Subject: Re: [T2] too much air (windshield washer)


&gt; 
&gt; On the hoses, I have had spectacularly bad luck finding metric hose here
&gt; in the colonies :-( I am told that fish tank air hose is good, but have
&gt; not tried it.  I tend to salvage good hose when I see it in yards,
&gt; especially the reinforciing collar pieces VW used.
&gt; 


www.motorworks_dot_com  has the hose in either 1 or 2 meter lengths...........
