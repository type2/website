Subject: Archives status, should be working...
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

Archives should be working, there were a few 4 hour outages over the last 3
days... I switched ISP's and doubled the bandwidth to 128K.  Hopefully we
are at 100% and should be up and accessible at all times.

If anyone sent me e-mail and had it returned, please re-send.

As noted on the archives page, please use the Complex search if you are
trying to find the most recent messages.  I updated it this week and it
should only be a day or two behind.

http://spike.i405_dot_com/  &lt;== New way to get to archives.  You can still get
there with http://www.i405_dot_com/vwarchive/ too.

Search of &quot;heat* near blow*&quot; which will match &quot;heater blower&quot;, &quot;heat blower&quot;
and &quot;blowing heat&quot; all at at once!

Archives are down while they switch to a new ISP. The message in question
is here at egroups though:
