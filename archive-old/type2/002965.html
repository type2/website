I had my 1600 engine totally rebuilt after I purchased a non -running
71 westy (broken Crankshaft!) in Sept 98.  I used the muir manual that I
found under the front passenger seat - 75 edition all torn and greased up,
to remove and then reinstall the motor.  Muir and I did the entire thing
ourselves, except the actual thrust that matched the engine to tranny.
Anyway, I had methodically labeled everything, and put everything back
exactly, so i jumped in the front seat, turned the key, and NOTHING.  So I
tried everything he suggested, until the last resort - hammer, sign of the
cross, etc.  Got back in, turned the key, and viola! that sweet sound.  It
only lasted shortly though, as I had somehow put the fuel line on backwards
and it stalled after about 20 seconds.
Anyway - I only drive my westy during the summer, but I start it every week,
and last month, for the first time in two + years, i turned the key, and got
nothing again.  I climbed under, tapped it, sign of the cross, etc. and it
has started everytime since.  So, that's my story, and I didn't even know
about this list back then, or else I would have asked the same question.
BTW - I knew nothing about VW's, and everything I've learned has been from
Muir, Bently, and this list.

Have a great Friday
