&gt; I'm sorry I don't have a spare right now George. I was kind of curious
&gt; when I pulled the engine from my 67 bus and noticed that the PO had run
&gt; the engine for about 20,000 miles with the fanbelt way out of alignment.
&gt; He had used a 38 amp generator (probably original to the bus), bus hub,
&gt; but standard backing plate.  I just so happened to have the correct
&gt; backing plate and so while it was off, I compared 2 hubs I had.  I wished
&gt; I had taken a picture of it to show the difference in sizes.
&gt; 
&gt; I wouldn't say it's any big deal if you shim the fan one way or the other.
&gt; As long as it has some bite on the shaft...

That's my thought on it.  I had to move both of the thick washers to the
alterntor side of the fan, so the only washer on the nut side is the
locking washer (the thick wavy one)  There are no sharp edges bearing
against the fan, and the washers on either side are keyed to the flats in
the hub, so the fan drive should be fine.

However, the engineer in me wonders why VW used those thick washers in
there.  I can't see any logical reason, and not understanding why
something was done the way it was bothers me.
