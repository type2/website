&lt;&lt; I was cleaning out my part boxes and found an 009 and a 4BR8 
 distributors.  They seem to be in excellent shape, heck the 009 is 
 almost new with the origional Bosch box! &gt;&gt;

hmmm...dont most vw parts distributors have boatloads of these 009s...you can 
get them anywhere for about $50-60 i think.
