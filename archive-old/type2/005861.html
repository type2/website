&gt; Jim, who obviously treats his VW to caviar and premium grade gas, opines:

&gt; if they could have seen *that* far into the
&gt; future, we wouldn't need to run premium in these little cars now!) or if
it
&gt; was just for overall longevity, and I don't care either.
&gt;

I run regular (87 octane) in Itch. When I had the motor rebuilt, I worked
very closely with my mechanic, and decided to set the CR to 6.8. So far, no
pinging.

It's hard to determine how much, if any, more power I would get from
premium, 'cuz the hill I generally use to see how fast I can go has variable
wind directions - a much more deciding factor on top speed than the gas
grade.

(though I do treat Itch to a tank of premium about once a month).

It's WEEKEND time! See you folks Monday. Have a great one.
