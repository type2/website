Subject: Re: [T2] Bus won't run i need help

I had the same trouble after rebuilding a 1600DP on my bug. Everything
hooked up ..new plugs and everything. cranked over but would not start..
Turned out I had a leak at the intake manifold on one side and that made
the mixture way too lean and not enough to ignite.
Worth a try..check em out.
