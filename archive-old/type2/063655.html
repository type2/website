Subject: road trip Seattle to San Fran--advice sought

We will be driving &quot;The Carcass&quot; (which will no longer be a carcass) 
from Seattle to San Francisco, during the latter half of October.  If 
anybody has any suggestions of what to see / what to miss, we would 
be most appreciative.  Our southerly route will be as follows:

Seattle to Portland on I-5
Portland  to 101 via 26 and 6
101 through Oregon to California
hwy. 1 to Albion
128 to 101
101 to San Francisco

We are also looking for an interesting return route, something east of 
I-5, but staying on the west side of the mountains as much as possible.  
If anybody has any suggestions, please don't be shy.  : )

We're not looking for driveways, only tourist opportunities.

thanks!

.....be on the road in no time.

'70 Westy               So the kids they dance they shake their bones
&quot;The Carcass&quot;   Cause its all too clear we're on our own
