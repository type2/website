couple questions.

got a 78 type 2 with an automatic

1.  how compatable are the 78/79 trannys with the 80/82 vanagons

2.  anyone know a rebuilder, prefer in the mid atlantic area

3.  anyone have a good one sitting in their garage??

&gt; near future.  I see similar wear and tear on transaxles all the
&gt; time and take it as a matter of fact.  After all, the trans could
&gt; be as old as 31 years now!
