&gt;I've seen Chrysler, Honda, VW and Kawasaki products with peeling clearcoat
&gt;as well.  Probably others, but I can't recall specific instances.

It's true that back in the eighties most vehicles had crappy paint from the factory.  I'm told this is because of new environmental regulations that outlawed the use of current paints and forced new ones to be created.  It took a while before the quality of the paints came back up to par, but from what I've seen most cars painted since the early 90's are holding up very well.  I think it's analogous to what happened with emissions.

My '87 Mustang had bad paint which lasted only a few years before it began fading.  The '93 Mustang I have now, despite being ten years old has very nice, original paint.  After a good polish and wax job, it looks nearly new (with the exception of the front 1/8 of the car which suffers from rock chips).  I think paint has improved a lot and is much, much better than it was 15-20 years ago.
