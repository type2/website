Subject: Re: [T2] respirator for sandblasting? 

&gt;   Regarding silicosis- I was talking to a professional sandblaster
&gt;   last night, and asked him about this issue. He said they haven't
&gt;   used silicate sand for years because of the dangers involved. They
&gt;   use different sand even though it isn't as effective a blasting
&gt;   media. And, they always use suits with supplied air, even on their
&gt;   mobile units.

admitting that I am a total amateur, but I use something
called &quot;Black Beauty&quot; which is pulverized slag as that
is what the professional sandblaster I begged advice from
said I should use
