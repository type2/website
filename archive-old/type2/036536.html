Subject: Will the Motor from a 1973 Van go into 1979 ??

Hi Volks,

I'm considering swapping the driveline (1700cc dual-carb motor and trans)
out of my rotting and rolliing 1973 westy into a 1979 van that has no tranny
and an unknown motor, but a great body.

Will it fit? Are the support-system electrics compatible? Anyone done this?

Your comments gratefully accepted.

Thanks in advance,
