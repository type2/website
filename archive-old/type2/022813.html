Hi- Only things I can think of are that a wheel cylinder is sticking (rear
brakes)  or that the rear brake return spring(s)  have lost their pulling
power !! - these should be replaced when you do the shoes - I'm not sure that
everyone does but I guess one day they will give up. Maybe it is difficult,
but can you jack up the rear wheels when the pedal is &quot;wooden&quot; and see if the
brakes are binding- that at least will narrow down the problem to the front or
rear ?. 
Good luck

&lt;On a 1971 bus, the following occurs:
after driving for some time, the pedal freeplay disappears, the pedal gets
very wooden, and, it feels to me as if the brakes are engaging, albeit
slightly.&gt;
