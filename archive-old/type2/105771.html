Subject: porsche pulley in

Done.
No problem and no modifications.
I got a belt from a local chain flaps. I was having a little difficulty
finding a 10AV belt in the range I wanted to try. The counter guy said he
cross ref'd Eric y Barbs fresh start 13345 and fished down a Goodyear
belt which was 11AV0875. Seemed a tad fishy but I took it anyway. Ill
probably grab some 9.5 or 10 x 875 belts from my cuban vw flaps or order
them. Im a bit suspicious of these wider belts because past experience
has me thinking they wont last as well.
Results.
I measured the ratio with the standard upper pulley and the old
stretched out 9.5 x 905.
 (I have a degree crank pulley. Standard size but I think the belt rides a
little lower)
Anyway it was a dissapointing 1.6 DOH!

The 11AV0875 rides nicely up on the new pulley where I like it maybe 1/8
inch down from the lip. And the new ratio was exactly where I hoped to be
at 2.2. Lucky.

I should know if it has the desired effect on monday when I travel to
work. Its pretty summery here already, mid to upper 80s and Ive seen the
oil gauge around the 220 mark. Gauge reads a little low maybe 8 deg or so.
This isnt warm at all but I know when I head out on a real summer trip it
can get 10-20 degrees higher and I tend to drive slower minding the temps.

BTW I dont see that the porsche pulley is much better made than my stock
vw part for like 1/10 the cost. the giant nut is cool though.

peace
