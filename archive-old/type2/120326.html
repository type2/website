Subject: RE: [T2] New items and interest (jailbar partnr)

I have always been curious as to if jailbars were
ever placed on or were intended for the late
model bus or vanagon,.... 

The 84 Wolfsburg Vanagon (low top weekender with
backrests on the middle seat that folds forward)
had jail bars.  The vanagon years had lotsa
changes from year to year and midyear switches. 
Vanagon list could probably help if you really
needed to know what models and years.
