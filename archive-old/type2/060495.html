Hi all,

I have a '76 bus I bought about a year ago, that I'm trying to figure out.  It
seems that the engine is okay, I've been trying to do tune-ups, etc. to keep
it running.  My major problem is the electrical system.  It seems like
everytime I've ever touched anything on the bus, some wire somewhere gets
disconnect or causes a short, or something electrical ends up not working.
This is extremely frustrating,  now I just assume that anytime I open the
engine compartment lid, after I finish whatever I plan on doing that the bus
will sit for a week while I figure out the latest electrical mishap.  It's
driving me crazy, and making me not love my beloved so much.  So, what I want
to do is spend a weekend, or a week, and just overhaul the entire electrical
system.  Try and fix everything once and for all (or almost).  I mean going
over every circuit, replacing wires and connections and fuses.  The alternator
and starter have always worked fine, the battery is brand new.  I think that
the majority of the problems are caused by old wires and dirty connections.
I'm pretty sure that I can figure this out with the diagrams I have.  So, my
question is:  Is this a) a good idea; b) an okay idea, but it will take years
to do;  or c) a terrible idea?  Or, Can I take it to an Auto-Electric Shop and
get them to do it (if so, how much should it cost)?  If this is something that
can  be accomplished what kind of wires and connections should I get, and
where from?  (i.e. what gauges and length of wire do I need, so I don't have
to pull each one and take it to Radio Shack and try and match it;  J.C.
Whitney has a couple sets of spools of different gauge wires and 1.000 piece
connector sets).  I'd really appreciate any input on this.

Thanks,
