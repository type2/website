Deciding to replace my rear shoes, as one wheel does not respond much to handbrake cable adjustment and the shoes are not in great condition.  I bought a stock set of rear shoes for my '79 type 2 bus.  On taking off a pair of the old shoes I see that the old shoes have the handbrake lever riveted on and the bottom third of one shoe falls short of brake lining material.  The new shoes come without a handbrake lever.  The parts guy recommends drilling the old ones out and bolting them on to the new shoes.  Contacting another parts place, they sell me a headed pin with a groove at the other end that accepts a supplied open ended clip.  The idea being to hold the old lever onto the replacement shoes with this.  This clip does not fit tight onto the groove on the pin end.  The Questions are; to hold the assembly together correctly, do I crimp the open ended clip onto the pin?  Is there any need to include packing washers or pressure washers?  How tight should the whole assembly be?  Any lubrication?  Is this a viable conversion, or should I fit type 3 shoes as surgested to me by another supplyer?  (He says these are what I have on anyway, due to the fact that one of the shoes has a third of the lining material missing.) If anybody has done this job can they advise me before I progress as I have not done a shoe change before and don't want to screw up.
Cruse on.
