Subject: Re: title waves...

&gt;Someone said that if you carry a title-less car to AL, the local DMV will
&gt;set you up with a new title lickety-split(well, a few weeks or so).  I'd
&gt;check into this, or maybe a closer state to you that also has this policy.

That is true.  I lived in Alabama a few years back.  There (AL) the law is
&gt;= 25 years old = no title.  In GA the same applies.  The problem is when
you sell the car to someone in a state that questions why the car has no
title issued from the state in which the registration is...Trust me, I just
went through this.

The Alabama DMV was involved in the previously mentioned example, and they
were VERY cooperative.  In fact, it seems that they don't give a hoot about
an old VW.  They cooperated without question.

In my situation, I sold a car with a TN title, AL registration, and GA Bill
of Sale...What a mess.
