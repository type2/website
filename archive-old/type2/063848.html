Subject: RE: Original license plates

I believe that Steven was right on this one.  In the driver's handbook, there is
a somewhat ambiguous statement that says something to the effect that, in
addition to the standard issue plate, one can purchase a special duty plate,
such as the Yosemite one, or one can get plates for the original year of issue
for the vehicle in question.  Armed with the driver's handbook, even a
recalcitrant DMV clerk might be convinced to put out a little effort on your
behalf.  This is one of the things on my to do list, but going to the DMV is
such a low priority (and dismal excursion) that it still has not been done.  

BTW, as DMV's go the one in Santa Cruz is far and away the most pleasant one I
have been to (if one can imagine pleasantness as least amount of time spent with
the beauracracy).

Good luck,
terry
