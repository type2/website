On the  other hand a similar google search for Mark Dearing Salem Import
doesn't  seem to find any stories about PO'ed ex-customers sueing him in
court, let  along them winning judgements against him...




hey Guys  Thank You  I plan to keep it that way. Being in this  bus. since 
1980 and yes you will not please everybody. I have been sued a couple  of times 
but won both cases when I proved that they were wrong . I work hard it  having 
a great following among  the VW group and really enjoy camping  with the full 
moon bunch and  do the tech class at High Country for the  last 5 years, 
which by the way we haven't seen Mario since about April. I am  sure he has a good 
reason. later  Mark Dearing
