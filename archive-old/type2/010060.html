Howdy all,

I hate it when folks don't come back and say what did and did not work
so... 

To the person who Pmailed me and told me to stop whinning... well you're
right.  Guess I should type my letter to the list before I have a margarita 
at the end of a depressing day, instead of after:)  

And thanks for the input MikeG, I appreciate the time you took to write!  No
worries about &quot;insulting my intelligence&quot;.  I double checked to make sure I
did not have the 1 &amp; 3 wires crossed.  That would be a hard thing to do I
think, but I've done dumber things!  I didn't think it would be the cam as
the bus ran great when I pulled it from my last bus.  I did a compression
test for completeness, 120 on 1 and 3.

And to Phil, I could kiss you:)  You live in the NW?  If your'e near
Portland, I'll buy you a beer:)  There is a solid metal tube that connects
those two nipples together (via a rubber hose on each nipple as you say),
and also ties in the vacuum assist.  I unhooked it, and stopped up the
nipples on the 1 and 3 manifolds, and wah-lah!  Bus is firing on all four!
Not sure where the leak is, since the vacuum assist was hooked up as well,
but I'll look into that tomorrow..  

I'm driving without vacuum assisted brakes.  Whew, I had to slam on the
brakes to stop from rear ending someone (who slammed on there brakes to keep
&gt;from hiiting an idiot that ran out into the road).  I locked up the tires,
but whew... took some effort!

-&gt;Just went through the same thing myself. The brake servo draws its vacuum off
-&gt;of the #1 &amp; #3 cylinders. There should be two &quot;pipes&quot; coming from the intake
-&gt;manifold, each with an L-shaped rubber bootie. Check those. The booties connect
-&gt;to a pipe arrangement that exits through the foreward bulkhead, check the hose
-&gt;connection on the other side of the bulkhead. That's where my problem was (hose
-&gt;disconnected) and as far as I can help you.
-&gt;
-&gt;Good luck.

-&gt;&gt; PROBLEM:
-&gt;&gt;         Among other things it seems it is not firing on 1 and 3.
