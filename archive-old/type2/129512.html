Subject: Halon vs halotron (fire ext.) and a plug for a source

 Wish to mention my experience re looking to buy halon ext. for
daughter's bus- some Google fishing showed that Halon was actually
banned back in 96, but existing supplies can be used and recycled- as
its actual use in a fire removes its ozone depleting properties.  Many
companies sell halotron, which is touted as being equal to halon, but
actually needs about twice the poundage for equal usage against halon.
   I dealt with the company H3R, and ordered a 5 lb reconditioned can 
(10 sec. discharge time) for $119, much less than the over $200 I'd seen
for a 10BC rated extinguisher.  The site still lists this option (see
link above) although they notified me by phone they were out and were
sending a new can. Had a nice talk with the rep- he'd like to know how
users dealt with an engine fire that may be only a couple of feet from
where you open the hatch?  Does anyone fire down the vents with any
success? I'll ask in a separate post.
