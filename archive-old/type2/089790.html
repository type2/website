Subject: Still hard shift &amp; noise...WORSE

--part1_166.1100bbb3.2a6dfad7_boundary

'72 Westy with a 1700 and stock tranny.

Well, I went checked the shifter plate, the rear shifter coupling, and 
checked the clutch adjustment and still I had hard shifting and noise while 
in gear and in neutral. (I was wrong when I said that there was no noise in 
neutral in my first post on this problem.)

BUT NOW...

It won't move. Even in neutral, it's like it's halfway engaged and it stalls 
the engine. Push the clutch in and it will idle fine and shift, but once you 
try to drive, it's like it's not engaging all the way. It won't move forward 
or back. It won't even roll in neutral. This happened suddenly while I was 
going back and forth up the driveway... What now?
