Thanks to all for the suggestions, but now I have a new wrinkle.

Rechecked static timing per group suggestions, etc. No change (still backfiring,
etc.). Ran compression test. No compression. None. On any cylinder. Didn't try a
wet test. Checked guage on other engines--it was fine.

I figured even if the valve timing were off a couple notches (I did align the gears
up per the manual) that I'd get some compression. But none? I does seem to have
compression when I turn the engine over manually. Arghh.

I thought I'd query the list one more time before pulling the engine again and
going over it.
