Subject: Re: converters for frig and other 12v stuff

The original 4 amp converter provides enough current for the frig, and
can give a little extra for running some fans and a small TV. But the
current is unfiltered and can cause interference patterns on a TV- you
must keep the battery in the curcuit to act as a capacitor, which creats
issues of overcharging.  You'd do better buying a converter (say 10
amps) that is filtered (can run radios, tv's by itself, as well as the
frig.)  I found a 50 amp one at a yard sale; ham radio operators have
these.  It's wired in so one flick of a SPDT switch will run extra 12 v
outlets I put in; it can run a VCR, 9&quot; tv, fans, interior lights, radio,
and a spot lamp all at the same time without going across the battery
terminals.
