Subject: Riviera?

I am interested in purchasing a '72 Camper near where I live. It is in
good shape and VERY cheap..The camper top is one piece from front to
back and from a distance looks like normal Westy, but when closer, it is
different. It pops straight up about 24 inches. There is room for two
adults to sleep and it has a skylight in the roof. Is this a Riviera?
If so, are they rare? What are they worth in US dollars?

Any help appreciated...
