Hi,
	Gerge Lyle writes:

&gt; 1540, which is at least load range C in 185R14.  Load range D is usually
&gt; the same price, so you might as well go for that.

 My impression is that the gradings are equivalenced as follows 
for standard sized bus tyres:

  standard		1521lbs	95
 &quot;reinforced&quot;	1609lbs	97
 &quot;LR C&quot;		1709lbs	99
 &quot;LR D&quot;		1874lbs	102

 But note that the load range figure changes with the tyre size...

Cheers,
	 W.
