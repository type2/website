&gt; Hey All,
&gt;         This should be an easy one. Last night our '78 bus's turn signals
&gt; went belly-up. They are blinking real fast. My first concern is that they
&gt; are having a flash back to the days of disco. Maybe a bad bulb or fuse?
&gt; 
&gt; Any one want to take a crack at this.
&gt; Perhaps I can pickup the parts on the way home.

Almost certainly a bad bulb (or connection to one).  The &quot;disco flash&quot;
is a built-in indication that the load is low and that you have lost the
signal.  VW, Audi, etc. all have this feature after about '75.

HTH... :&lt;)
