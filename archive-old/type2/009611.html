&gt;So my choices now?
&gt;--------Spend another 180 for a nother new left side head, install it
&gt; and continue to drive the bus waiting for myself to make another
&gt; expensive mistake--Are there any left?

FIX YOUR BUS AND KEEP DRIVING IT!!!!!! 

Do not underestimate your abilities and remeber that there are good folk
like Sean (who has helped me out a few times and deserves a special award
for email and IRC diagnosis) who will point you in the direction of the
light at the end of the tunnel:)
