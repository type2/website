Subject: Re: [T2] looking for THIS hose - see pic

That molded hose is NLA. I am still looking for a replacement for mine. The
ID is 22mm. The largest metric vacuum hose Ive been able to find is 17mm. If
you could find a stout enough 13/16 or close smog hose that would work also.
I looked at some of these hoses in a salvage yard today and they didnt look
much better than what I had. It might be hard to find a used one that is not
all dried up and cracked.

Good Luck

&gt;     For a 76 FI it's the hose going from the S-hose to the oil breather.
&gt;  Mine broke and I was wondering if this is sold by anybody new, if I
&gt; should start looking in yards, or if a non molded replacement will
suffice.
