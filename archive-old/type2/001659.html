My engine was out of the Bus for almost 2 weeks w/ no oil. When I started it
today the valve noise was awful.
(Then my starter blew!!!)
Q: Am I going to have to take out all the lifters and prime each one? Or
will they eventually pump up? I had it running for 3-5 minutes w/ no sound
of getting quieter.
