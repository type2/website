Subject: Engine stalls when choke fully opens


As soon as my choke opens the last bit the engine sputters out and dies. It
is actually in a 71 super bug so single carb 1600cc engine. Any ideas would
be great as I had to put my bus away for our cruel Canadian winter but would
still like to drive a VW.

cheers and merry x-mas
