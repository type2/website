Subject: valve problems

Hello to all who are listening,
Once again I have come upon something troublesome and I
am greatful to have the collective wisdom of this list
available. My problem is this. I attempted to adjust my
valves tonight. I lined up the rotor with the notch in
the distributer. I also lined up the notch in my pully
with the seam in my fan housing (This is a T4).
I then proceeded to loosen my intake and exaust valves
on the #1 cylinder. The exaust came loose ok but the intake
side has a problem. I can completely remove the adjuster and the
valve still sits on the rocker arm. What does this mean?
Is my head trash? Thanks to all
