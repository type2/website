&gt;I understand there's an initiative to drop a '62 23-window deluxe into
&gt;Lake Eeeeeeeeerie to rescue a group of endangered shellfish that can only
&gt;live in breadboxes. Any one else hear about this? ;) Joe

In a related story, a group of sentient bivalves from an alternate 
universe dropped a 23-window deluxe into their local large body of water. 
After only a few hours the bus was lifted out of the water. The crowd of 
bivalves stared in amazement as the bus was literally covered with vw 
fanatics from stem to stern.
