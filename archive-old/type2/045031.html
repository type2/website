Subject: [T2] More 79 engine pull

Thanks to   Steve Dolan I realilzed that I had pulled the bolts that
hold the trans to a carrier and support the rear of the trans. So I
spent some time this successfully puting those back! I was also able to
find the upper left bolt between the engine and trans and remove it. I
can NOT find the upper right one though.  Is it the top bolt of the
starter? If so, where is the bolt that you can hold from the inside of
the engine compartment - this is what the Bentley manual says for
starter removal. If it is not the upper starter bolt, where is it????
Maybe this is why some folks suggested I remove both the trans and motor together........hmmmmm!
