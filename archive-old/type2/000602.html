Don't think anyone sells 'em hence the market in second hand ones.Also
slight problem in the later rear valances is that the chassis no. is stamped
on the bit you're going to remove also the bumper brackets are different for
the early bay becuase of the removable rear valance-also you'll have to
change your tin wear to suit the smaller shape-just a few thoughts but its
easy if you already own a '71 bus ;IMHO the worst thing VW ever did removing
the early valence why?anything to do with discouraging home mechanics as the
computor diagnostic socket arrived when they changed over to the fixed
valance.Just a guess or am i just paranoid-conspiracy he was acting alone

Subject: [T2] a different rear valance question


&gt; Hello list.
&gt;
&gt; I have searched through the type 2 archives and was
&gt; looking for a distributer that sells the removable
&gt; rear valance, rear apron, what ever you want to call
&gt; it. I didn't find one. I probably just overlooked it.
&gt; does any one know of a dealer that sells a aftermarket
&gt; removable rear valance for a 1968-72 type 2. I want to
&gt; convert mine from a non removable one to a removable
&gt;
&gt; a year!  http://personal.mail.yahoo_dot_com/
