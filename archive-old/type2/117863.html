Subject: Re: [T2] Carb Cleaner

&gt; I am going to rebuild my carbs on my '73 (34-PICT 3,4) today and have a
&gt; question: The article in the library on this subject mentioned a carb
&gt; cleaner that comes in something like a paint can that you can actually
&gt; dip parts into. Sounds like a great idea, but just got me a blank look
&gt; at my local FLAPS. My question is this: Is there anything special in
&gt; carb cleaner? Could I use another solvent (diesel perhaps)?

I rebuilt a '74 carb (34-PICT 4 I believe) a year or so ago. The cleaner I
used came in a paint can which also contained a metal basket so that parts
can be placed in the can to soak. I had a rebuild kit which contained all
the gaskets, seals, etc as well as some of the valves. I pretty much
followed the instructions that came with the kit and didn't have any
trouble.

&gt; Also, are there any good resources other than the Robert Kuhn article,
&gt; or any tips for someone who has never opened a carb before?

Watch out for springs. They are easy to loose track of. Whoever last
rebuilt my 34-PICT 4 lost one spring, which I replaced. For some strange
reason, they actually managed to get it to work without it.
