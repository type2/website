I beg to differ. They are not original if they have any kind of English
measure hole in them.

There is no radio in the dash now.....just a black hole......I was
wondering if any of the newer radio styles fit the bus. Where is the other
place to put speakers on a bus, since most radios come with a 4 speaker
connection. So, if I put 2 in the doors, where do I put the other 2?? In
the back area, a la Vanagon??
&gt;TIA for the info.

Re-read this part:

 Those of the
&gt;subjective approach must design the swap themselves to function as they
&gt;deem &quot;best&quot; or suffer functional problems, therefore, lost value. If
&gt;time/money has to fit under your &quot;best&quot; umbrella, stock is the only logical
&gt;choice.

See the Crutchfield catalog for help in designing for your own custom radio
system with custom sized speakers to fit the &quot;customized&quot; doors. They also
will have custom speaker boxes for the rear. 

OR 

Replacing the door panels and putting in a stock system will cost you less
time/money. Take a coffee can lid, cover it with your favorite material,
and cover the panel holes to save even more time/money. Or recover the
existing panels complete with your own idea of &quot;best&quot;. Your holes will be
out-a-sight, man.
