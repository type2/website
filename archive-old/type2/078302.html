Subject: Westfalia / Campmobile / Sink

&gt;Is there suposed to be some kind of support on the aisle side of
&gt;the sink/icebox cabinet to support the opened countertop?

There was on the earliest bay westies but IIRC it was dropped before the end of the &quot;Campmobile 70&quot; interior.  Change may have coincided with the introduction 
of the steel (previously plastic) sinktop.  Later mods are held up by the hinges, and I agree with the listee who said your hinges are bent.  

John Baker, if you have a true Westfalia campmobile 70 interior on your '71, you're missing your sink lid/counter.

&gt;PS Isn't there a link to a westy manual online somewhere?

That's what I thought, but I don't see the parts catalog online for the C70 model (BTW, that's not a &quot;1970 Campmobile&quot; but an interior arrangement called 
&quot;Campmobile 70&quot;.)

&gt;Westfalia made all the Campmobiles. Some had an optional pop-top, among other things.

Yes, the Westfalia label seems to confuse the heck out of newbies.  Westfaliawerke (&quot;Westfalia Works&quot;) made camper conversions referred to as Campmobiles 
in the U.S.  In other words --   Westfalia:Campmobile::Coleman:Lantern.

&gt;Aren't all &quot;westies&quot; pop tops? And the non-pop tops are VW campmobiles/weekenders? Or did Westfalia actually make non poppers?

As mentioned, Westfaliawerke's Campmobiles could be ordered with or without an &quot;elevating roof&quot; as it is called in the parts manual.  There were various configs 
of the interior, too (we're talking pre-74), including the &quot;Campmobile 80&quot; which had (I think) a fullwidth back seat, no suicide cabinet, and a much deeper 
headbanger cabinet since it was not a poptop (and thus didn't have the sunroof pocket, which cuts into ceiling space).

&gt;an option for the Campmobile, but refers to all of
&gt;them as Campmobiles, not Westfalias.

This would be like your Ford Falcon's owner's manual continually referring to &quot;Fords&quot; when it meant &quot;Falcons&quot;.  Westfalia company didn't call their product 
&quot;westfalias&quot; (or &quot;westfalien&quot; ;-).

&gt;Also, the manufacturer's tag on my bus states that it
&gt;was made by the Westfaliawerke. Go figure.

That would make sense when you consider the language spoken by the manufacturers.

&gt;A Westy is a Campmobile, simple as that.
&gt;Westfalia is the company that did the conversion and they were sold at VW
&gt;dealers under the marketing term Campmobile.

Outside the U.S., or beyond the early 70's, there were different labels for some of Westfalia's VW-based camper conversions, I believe.

So many of the kiddies say &quot;I got a Westy&quot; when they have a Riviera, or an Adventurewagon, or even just a bus with a bed in the back....  And let me rant for a 
bit about all those campers &quot;with a tent&quot; that really only have canvas walls on the poptop.

&gt;Now we got Westy's, we got Riviera's, we got plain? buses, we got non-pop
&gt;top Westy's, we got somethat pop all over and some that pop in the middle,
&gt;we got some that tilt in the front, we got some that tilt in the back?

Yep.

&gt;Can someone please reference something that explains all ofthe differences
&gt;to me?....so when someone says that they have a xxxx, I know what they are
&gt;talking about?
