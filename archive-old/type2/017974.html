There are a lot of different factors that go into choosing the right
tire. You have the advantage of knowing your particular driving needs,
but you probably don't have the all the knowledge you really should to
be second guessing the VW engineers.  Luckily, VW engineers have done if
for you, so you don't have to learn all the ins and outs of it--assuming
you are not too different from the average bus driver.  185R14, in a C
or D load range.  VW even tells you how much air to put in 'em!  All
this info is in your glovebox manual, and in the Bentley, and probably
in the Haynes too.

&quot;and there will be a million choices and I won't know where to go from
there. :)&quot;

Ha!  If you have one choice you'll be lucky.  The more likely outcome is
that they'll say &quot;185 what R14?&quot; (since most tires today have an extra
number in there where I just inserted the &quot;what,&quot; which is the aspect
ratio, which is a ratio hight to width, and is functionally a measure of
the profile of the tire) and then struggle with their terminal to find
something when you insist that 185R14 is correct.  Then, they'll come up
with a passenger car tire meant for a Volvo 240 or something, since
there chances are very slim they'll have an 185R14 in a C or D load
range.  They are going to want to sell you something they have in stock;
but you should stick to your guns and make them order the right tires.
It's worth the wait to have that nice stock bus tire.  Tall (to keep
that great bus ground clearance), tough (for anti-sway), and narrow
(easy on that fragile steering gear box and gas consumption).  I just
got some Yokohama Y356s through Sears for a reasonable price.  P-mail me
if you want to know what I found for price and availability when I let
my fingers do the walking.  Which reminds me: use your telephone, and
don't go to a tire store until the deal is done and the tires are in.

P.S. Now would be a good time to check the archives and/or ask the list
about alignment, since they're gonna ask you if you want that too.
