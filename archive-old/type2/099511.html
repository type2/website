Subject: Re: [T2] so, if I am testing for shorts, what am I doing wrong?

&gt;The test results you describe indicates an electrical load is connected 
&gt;from the positive side of the battery to ground. This is be normal unless 
&gt;everything is disconnected.
&gt;
&gt;The question is, is it 5 milliamps a desired load (to the radio memory as 
&gt;an example) or 5 amps to some undesired load.
&gt;
&gt;You need to use the ammeter function (start with the highest range) to 
&gt;determine if it is a trivial desired drain or a higher and maybe undesired one.

I would suggest using a dome light bulb in series with the battery to see 
if it is a large load (bright light) b/c most of the $20 multimeters would 
let the smoke out if subjected to a 5 AMP load in the current meter setting.

If the bulb is bright, big load, if the bulb doesn't light or is very dim 
you might be okay testing it with the meter.
