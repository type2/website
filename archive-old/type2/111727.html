&gt; Anyway, I purchased a few items from the Bus Depot, one of which was a
&gt; new steering damper. I installed it last night at 9:30 pm (couldn't wait)

&gt; that I need to replace the steering components, but in the mean time,

Todd. That damper will just mask the problem if it is in the tie rods.
It might help for a little but come back when the damper wears out.
Climb under the bus and have your SO get in. have here turn the wheel
back and forth just to the point of starting to move the wheels. You
SHOULD NOT have any noticable slop. If so replace the tie rods and/or
drag link. It's an easy job and makes a huge difference. My bay had a
fine steering system, but my split did not. I spent the $100 and got 2
tie rods and drag link. It made a huge difference in drivability.
