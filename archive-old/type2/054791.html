Subject: Re: Heater Box Exhaust pipes?

They run along the frame rail to the rear. They attach to the vent tube on
top of the flapper valve. They work with a syphon effect when you are moving
to draw off the heat from the heater boxes with the heat turned off. If you
just have the ealier round vent caps, they just dump heat off at the flapper
valves.


&gt; I was just told that my ' 78 Westy originally came with &quot;heater box
exhaust
&gt; pipes&quot;. Mine seem to be missing. There is nothing on the heater boxes that
&gt; looks like an exhaust pipe, just a hole in the top of the control boxes to
&gt; vent out the hot air when the control flapper is off. Is someone pulling
my
&gt; leg, or are the boxes really susposed to have there own exhaust pipes. If
so,
&gt; why? And do I really need them? The guy who told me this said that they
help
&gt; to keep the engine from over-heating. Thanks for the help.
