&gt;Hi All
&gt;I have a good solid lifter short engine and need to replace the engine
&gt;in my 83 Vanagon. Is there any reason why I can`t use the square port
&gt;heads from the 83 engine on the solid lifter 78 short engine other than
&gt;having to adjust the valves?

You will need to pry the inserts out of the motor mount holes so you
can use 10mm bolts that go with the Vanagon engine mount subframe.
You will have no dipstick without drilling the hole (upside down with grease
on the bit and you can easily get by with it but will be messy.)  Otherwise
you'll be OK.  The '78 should be hydraulic BTW of course but isn't necessarily
if it had been rebuilt.  The heads will bolt right on regardless.  And of
course
you have to use the Vanagon shroud and all Vanagon tin and ancilliary bits.
Have to use the Bus breather box obviously.

No real task to do though, the dipstick is the only real annoyance.  Doc Ric
has an accursed thing apparently in which a dipstick was merely stuck down
a hole in the Vanagon oil cap.  No real reason that doesn't work either, drill
the cap, calibrate your own dipstick, not gorgeous, useable.
