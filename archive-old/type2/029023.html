Use use 3M  #08633  sealant under the leaky seal, all the way around, its
made for this.

Its better to repair the rust holes, at least with body filler after
grinding the rust out, priming and painting the sill, and then replace the
seal.

Hello all,

Im assisting in getting my roommates westy ready for her big road trip and
one thing I thought Id like to tackle is help seal up the area just below
the front window, you know, where all the rust is?

Just below the window seal there are a bunch of really little holes, and im
assuming that everytime it rains this is where all the water is coming in
and puddling all over inside.

Any do it yourself tricks to seal this up, better than it is now anyway?
Looks arent important on this bus, just functionality so if its ugly, but
works, ill try it.

im still working on the heat thing, we are going to work on sealing the
pop-top the best we can (the best we can given the seal isnt there!) and I
think im getting the girl who owns this bus some thermal socks for
Christmas. =)


Thanks for all the tips,
Chris, Kell, and Tre'
