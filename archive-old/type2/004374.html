Mike sez:
But I occasionally carry a 5 gallon propane bottle or two to the local HW
store to get refilled.


Just a warning.  It is illegal to carry propane cylinders in a vehicle.  I
found out when I got a flat on the way home from a campout last year.  A cop
pulled over to make sure I was changing the tire right I guess but when I
opened the bus up to get out the jack he saw the large propane tank sitting on
the floor and made me tie it to the roof or ticket.  This was in SC.

Peace Brother,
