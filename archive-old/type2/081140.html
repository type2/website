Subject: Inertia reel seatbelts

Just installed an inertial reel seatbelt in my '71 Westy. I know that a =
lot of folks pick up used belts from the junkyard, but my local =
picknpull is so expensive I would rather buy something new than go =
through the trouble of removing my own part, waiting in line, and being =
charged 75% of the new price. (I've had good luck with BustedBus, but I =
don't think they have inertial reel seatbelts).

Got mine at www.gowesty_dot_com part# GVW-211-707 for 68-79 type II.  This =
was a true bolt-in installation, with all necessary hardware supplied. =
Looks like NOS VW parts (mine is dated 1985) that have been modified =
with correct spacers, etc. The salesman said that they do a lot of =
replacement belts for Porsches, which is another part of their business. =
Everything looks more than strong enough, and it only took 10 minutes to =
install. At $110., it's not cheap. But I didn't have to go to the =
junkyard and diddle with stuff, and the next time I reach for something =
in the glovebox I won't be pulled up short like a dog on a choker chain!

PS The instructions mention drilling a hole for one of the attachments, =
but I simply bolted it under the reel. No drilling needed.
