Ack.  The Facet pumps are noisy but the Holleys are even louder.  And they
cost too much, IMO.  If I were you I'd be getting a pump like this one:http://www.partsamerica_dot_com/ProductDetail.aspx?mfrcode=ACD&amp;mfrpartnumber=EP42S

.. nice and quiet.  Had a generic &quot;brand&quot; of that pump on my daily beater 
and never had a problem in four years.  Still worked when I sold the car.
