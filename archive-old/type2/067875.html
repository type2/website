Subject: Re: Bouncing messages, reports thereof...

Ken

I'm not posting them! I keep getting messages bouncing back to me that I sent once yet I'm getting a bounce report more than once... its not something I like to to get myself! Come to think of it I haven't seen any bounced header messages from the list either.

Sorry to be a pain, but I don't think I'm the fault here.

And to report... I have a mail problem :(

Not that frustrated really...
Ian
