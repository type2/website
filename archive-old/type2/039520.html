Subject: Westfalia Parts for Sale

I have a few Westfalia parts for sale:

1.  The rubber seal around the pop-top (3-sided).  I bought this from a guy on
the list awhile back, then it turned out that I did not need it, I just needed
to squeeze the metal clamps on the exiting seal to keep it from falling off.  I
don't remember what I paid for it.

2.  The water tank for under the sink, 1976 Westie.

3.  A couple of drawers from the kitchen cabinet, 1976 Westie.

I'm in Tucson.  If you need it, make me an offer for any of this stuff.
