Valves tightening up is v. bad.  Usually an indicator of a valve or
valve seat failing.  It's time to take it out and pull the offending
head. Please do this before it catastrophically fails as if it does,
you'll be looking at possibly a full rebuild.

&gt; I'm nearing 50,000 miles on my ultra-GEX rebuild. I'm frankly surprised
&gt; that it's held together this long.
