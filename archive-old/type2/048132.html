Subject: Re:[T2] auto tranny switch

&gt; Hello all, I'm planning on putting a 77 autotranny into a 74 bus...

The '74 bus was already an auto tranny bus, right? If not, it's probably
not worth your trouble. Generally, it only makes $en$e to keep a manual
manual and an auto auto. I've heard of it being done, but the conventional
wisdom is that it costs more to switch tranny types than it does to just
go buy the bus you want.

&gt; ... What should I do to autotranny before putting it into 74 bus, i.e.,
&gt; new seals, drain transmission oil, etc.?

If it's been sitting since '86, all of the above are a good idea. I would
add to that list, &quot;install new torque converter bushing and torque
converter seal.&quot;

&gt; ... Is there any thing I should
&gt; look for to that would
&gt; give me a hint that this autotransmission is bad...

Unfortunately, the only real test is to install it and see how it runs.
This is a fair amount of work, but straightforward in principle. And I
believe you can, with care, remove and install an auto tranny without
removing the engine. Be careful not to drop the torque converter while so
doing, and definitely remember to put the torque converter in the bell
housing before you install!

&gt; ...  The PO gave me the line
&quot;it was running fine when I parked her there in 1986.&quot;

These trannies can go for 200K miles plus between rebuilds. I'm told they
usually fail incrementally rather than castostrophically. Can he tell you
how many miles this one has on it?

&gt; ...  Will the 77 autotranny work correctly if I'm not running FI but
&gt; carb?

There will probably be some modifications necessary to the throttle
linkage. FI and carb throttle linkages are different. I can't tell you any
details about this part.

&gt;  ... Has anyone on
&gt; the list done this switch and If so does anything need modified or
&gt; retrofitted...

I put a several year old '82 auto tranny in my '78 and it fit perfectly.
There was one little linkage bracket on the '82 that had nowhere to go on
my '78, so I discarded it. An auto tranny rebuild guy told me the VW auto
tranny was basically the same for many models and years. I can't remember
how far back in time those trannies go though. Another auto tranny rebuild
guy told me that seals might have dried out inside a used tranny during
storage and here's how to tell if you're in trouble: Install it, put in
new ATF, drive 100 miles, then drain the ATF and look in the tranny fluid
pan. If seals are falling apart there will be peanut-sized gunky goobers
in the pan. Larger crunchy metallic fragments are also not good. If there
is just fine sediment, then you're good for the forseeable future.

I recall that depending on what needs replacing inside an auto tranny, a
rebuild can cost anywhere from $700-$1200.

Hope this helps. 

Good luck and persevere,
