Since I plan to put an oil temp guage on my 74 bus, I have been following
this thread with interest. As near as I can summarize, oil temps need to go
above 212F in order to drive out moisture, and temps of 220 - 240 are pretty
much OK.

Now for the monkey wrench: as I was tinkering in the engine compartment of
my bus last night, I noticed the remains of a spec sticker on the fan box.
This is a 74, originally set up with a 1700 engine that, according to the
sticker, met all emissions requirements in effect for CA. It gives the
timing as 10ATDC and then says: OIL TEMPERATURE 170-190F.

That seems awfully low to me. Any opinions?
