Yeah, yeah, yeah..... I *AM* a little behind, but they are finally
scanned, edited and posted.  Come and get 'em.  I hope someday (keep
breathing :-) to write an .html to be neat, but in the mean time the URL:

ftp://ftp.ari_dot_net/users/dworkin

Will point you to them.  There are pix of Derek Drew's synchro, Pat
Flynn's '75, Leno's ?'71?, two &quot;mystery vans&quot; (I don't know whose), as
well as a picture of the final caravan forming up.  If anyone wants the
.tif format images for further editing/wallpaper, I can e-mail if your
server will accept 2meg emails :-), but my space is &quot;chuffed tae the
gutties&quot; right now and I can't decide what to delete.  All of these will
come down next Monday morning for a week or so, but I expect to put
them back up after that.
