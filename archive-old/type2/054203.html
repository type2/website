Subject: Fuel filler hose and fuel sender fix.

I have both removed and replaced my fuel tank and filler hose with the
engine in on my 78. I did it also with the engine out and that was much
easier. Doing it with the engine in requires that you remove a lot of the
FI components that stick up above the engine, but I think it's still a lot
less work then removing the engine by myself, and it gives you a chance to
inspect and replace vacuum line connectors etc. As far as the filler hose,
removing the brain is a 2 minute job (if you do it last after removing the
air filter assembly) and I would guess would save a lot of personal
frustration when re-installing the filler hose.
