It's not all that difficult to rebuild your old stock vacuum-advance or =
combo vacuum/centrifugal advance distributor.

I once looked through a couple of large carboard boxes full of Bosch =
distributors, almost all of which had been replaced with a Bosch 009 =
centrifugal advance distributor. Nearly all of them needed only a good =
cleaning and scrubbing, maybe bead blasting.

The axial (up &amp; down) play of the distributor shaft was excessive in =
many of them. I bought a couple hundred or so insulative washers which =
had the correct inside diameter from an auto electric shop, a place =
where they rebuild alternators, generators, starters, etc. I threaded =
all these washers onto a piece of all thread, placed steel washers and =
nuts on each end, tightened the nuts, and then had a machinist turn on a =
lathe this stack of washers down to the proper diameter needed for the =
distributor.

After scrubbing the disassembled dizzy in naptha, I let it dry a little =
bit and lubed everything thoroughly with synthetic gear lube (heavy oil =
should work fine).=20

Using a nail punch, I drove the key holding the dog gear out of its hole =
in the side of the bottom of the distributor shaft. The dog gear then =
came off the shaft. I was then able to add the correct number of =
insulative washers to take up any excessive axial play of the =
distributor shaft. The correct amount of axial play, as far as I can =
tell, is just a little, enough to let everything turn easily. I then =
replaced the dog gear. After reassembling the distributor, I tested the =
vacuum canister by s*cking (The content filter won't let me say su*k. =
Really!) on it and watching it advance the timing plate.

Bosch makes a distributor rebuild kit which contains, among lots of =
other things, an insulative washer or two for the bottom of the dizzy =
shaft. I found that almost all the old dizzies needed only cleaning, =
lubing and a new insulative washer or two on top of the dizzy dog.

Caution: The first time I replaced the dog gear, I replaced it exactly =
180 degrees from its original position and the engine backfired like a =
rifle shot, scaring the peepee out of everyone in the shop.
