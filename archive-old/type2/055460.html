This is my first attempt at posting to the list. I am the new, proud 
owner of the &quot;Forrest Gump&quot; bus. It is a 1965 camper. From appearances, I 
believe it is a westfalia but I havent found an ID plate yet. It has been 
used to store VW parts and they havent been removed yet and I havent 
moved it yet. I've got to rep[lace the tires and then tow it home. The 
wife thinks I am nuts and she is surely right. But I have been looking 
for a good bus for 27 years!! Every time I find one that isnt completely 
trashed, someone has beaten me to it! I have stories that would make any 
grown bus nut cry. But this time, I was first!
Anyways, what brings me to the list is this. . .I am getting ready to do 
some airbrush work for the guy I bought the bus from. His bus is a 1978. 
But, here is the catch. . .he wants me to do something on the engine 
tins. On one hand, I think this is a great idea. The bus is stock on the 
outside, so some wild designs in the engine compartment will be a totally 
unexpected surprise. And I have come up with a beautiful concept, which I 
don't care to share at this time. But I am worried about the heat and the 
effects it may have. Since the engine is brand new and has all the latest 
cooling goodies, I think the tin will stay a reasonble temperature that 
wil not adversely effect the enamel paint I will be using. Does anyone 
have any input on this? I need to know soon, because he wants to put the 
engine in soon, so I plan on starting monday evening.
