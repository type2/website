Subject: Re: [T2] Painting Valve Covers:

&lt;&lt; No dont do that. Bar-B-que paint is high temp which means it contains some 
ceramic type content. This will act as an insulator. Since they are exposed 
to air, and this cools them, use a flat black spray paint. It wont burn 
away, and its the best at radiating heat. Gloss is a poor conductor as is 
Chrome.

Pity that the VW uses the bales for securing the valve covers...My Bugeye
has an aluminum finned cover that is noticably cooler to the touch than
the stock &quot;tin&quot; valve cover...The aftermarket covers that have been
written up on the list don't seem to be reliable enough to justify pur-
chase...
