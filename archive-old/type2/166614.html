Subject: front doors rebuild

I have a set of front door fully disassembled (bare) and repainted. Hinges
still on...

I have a set of front doors that are going to be replaced with these
refinished doors.  They have all the hardware still attached.  I will take
this hardware out of the old doors and put them into the refinished doors.

What are the procedures and sequence for putting the hardware/glass into the
empty doors, like what goes in first, second...
I seriously need guidance . . .  not 'replacement is the reverse of
removal'.  Do I do the door latch, regulator, outside scraper, window,
inside scraper, vent window, remaining bits and pieces??  I just don't want
to get part way through, like putting on the engine tin and forgetting a few
pieces..

Thanks
