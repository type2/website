&lt;&lt; I usually shy away from autostore &quot;accessories&quot; but I'm wondering if 
anyone has tried this leather wrap and can comment on it.

I've got a leather wrap on my bus wheel that came from a local auto
boutique...$15. Been a while tho', prices that high?
The leather feels much better that the plastic; but not as good as the
wood on another car's Brooklands wheel...
