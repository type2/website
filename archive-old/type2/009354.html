Hi all,
     We're at Cataract Lake campground this morning, just outside of 
Williams, AZ. We've got a nice little spot right next to the lake, under 
the ponderosa pines, with an elegant view of the opposite shoreline. It's 
a nice little place, and for $8 you can't go wrong... ;-) Does make me 
wish I had my fishing tackle and an AZ license though. 

     We made slow progress yesterday, partialy to taking it easy on the 
new engine, partially because we have a habit of finding things to do. 
We're working on finding things to do that we can do while we drive. ;-) 
The drive to this point was largely uneventful, just a straight shot 
accross the CA desert, and up the hills to AZ. The bus has performed 
well, managing about 18mpg for the most part. I'd like more, but I can 
settle for that right now. Of course, the uphill stretches killed both 
our mileage and our speed... One thing you can say about the climate: 
cold. It was down in the mid 40's last night, which is much cooler than I 
had anticipated. Brr. We had a small fire to help, but it was one of 
those nights where one side is always cold...  This morning it's starting 
to warm up, but it's not exactly comfortable just yet. One major problem: 
the percolator we got at WalMart doesn't work. One could safely say we 
are not pleased about this development. I finally gave up on making it 
work and just dumped the coffee in the pot it self. We'll do the old boil 
and strain thing. Yuck. Wish I'd brought my portable drip setup. Oh 
well... 

     The plan for today is to mosey on over to NM, then down through 
Roswell to the vicinity of Carlsbad Caverns. The original plan was to 
camp there and check out the caverns, but at the rate we're going I'm not 
sure we'll have the time. We shall see. On piece of advice when doing a 
trip like this: don't have a deadline to get home, it makes the trip a 
bit less enjoyable...  :-( I guess that's it for now, we need to hit the 
road...


Peace,
