Subject: Re: [T2] Why is my governor seal still leaking? (please help)

&gt; I have an 81 Vanagon with automatic transmission.  I'm trying to get it
&gt; to stop leaking.  Anyway, I replaced a bunch of seals that were leaking,
&gt; and everything is going well except for this stinking governor!

&gt;  I ordered a new govenor seal (it's actually an O Ring) which seemed a
&gt; little strange, because it is larger in diameter than the governor cap.
&gt; Anyway, I pulled out the old O ring, which seemed fine, replaced it, put
&gt; the cap and that metal spring thing that holds it all together.
&gt;
&gt; The (expletive here) cap leaks worse than before I started.

CLEAN CLEAN CLEAN,,,, gotta make sure that grove is perfectly clean...and
yes the O ring is larger than the cap, gotta scrunch it in to the
grove..make sure there are no gaps though.

&gt; Please help!  And, by the way, should there be automatic transmission
&gt; fluid around the govenor?  Seems odd, but hey, what do I know?

well it does move little valves in the govenor so I would suspect there is
some fluid in there but haven't checked or noticed particularly.  but I'm
pretty sure there is fluid in there.
