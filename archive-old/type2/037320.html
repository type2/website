Subject: &lt;F&gt; Just going to work..

A typical weekday in the life of Me &amp; Itch.

7:44A - Son and Daughter pile in. Argue over the front seat (and therefore,
eminent control of the Kenwood KRC) Either KROQ or another
Brittany/Christina/BSB/NSync station gets selected (yuck!).

7:45A - I jump into the driver's seat. Ahhhh. Turn the key to the beautiful
sound of a beast coming to life. Keep the idle low for the first few seconds
to give the lifeblood a chance to circulate. Into reverse. Throw it a rev.
Whumpa. Ahhh. Back out of the driveway. First gear, nice and easy. Second
gear, easy, then about 75 percent to 3600 RPM, to get the cobwebs out. Third
gear, rumble to the first stop sign. Turn left. Same thing to SS#2. It's
downhill to get onto the main drag heading toward School#1. Merge into
traffic with a quick 1st, 2nd, 3rd up to 33mph. Turn left into driveway of
School#1. Select first gear while stalking through the parking lot at
2600rpm - just enough to get a great, throaty sound from the 1915's
extractor without the whimpy &quot;whir&quot; of the cooling fan. The parents are
impressed, I say to myself.

7:48A - Back uphill to School#2. 30mph zone is tackled in 3rd at 33mph -
same reason as the parking lot. The stoplight a mile up will be at pretty
steep uphill angle. I stop. Set the parking brake. Wait. Light turns. Bus
moves forward and makes the left onto Foothill. Motor is still not warmed
up, but the choke thinks it is, so the next few stops are going to require
me to shift into neutral while slowing down to 20mph, to free my left foot
to hit the throttle before Itch dies. I prepare. Third gear at 2800 rpm is
just enough to keep the cops looking the other way on this 35mph street. And
the sound. Ahhhh.

7:55 - Drop off Kid#2 _at_ School#2. Warn him of the perils of mouthing off to
private-school teachers. Turn off the kid's radio station in favor of a good
'old rock-n-roll station, or on a weathery day, the traffic reports. Why do
people have to be such idiots when it rains?

7:57 - Back to Foothill. I've lived in this town long enough to know what
lane to be in on what stretch of the road, so as to make the best time going
the slowest (read: speed limit + 3mph) speed of any car on the road. The
cars that pass going 45 (in a 30mph zone now) soon find themselves behind me
again a time or three before pulling onto the freeway (hehehe). I goose 3rd
gear to 4000rpm on the onramp, with a satisfying shift into the 091's 4th
gear. I accelerate to 3200 rpm, and merge onto the tarmac. Those cars I
demeaned on the city road fly by - not to be seen again... until tomorrow.

8:05-&gt;8:23A - Cruising down the freeway, I stay out of the slow lane - let
the trucks and on-rampers and off-rampers fight over that lane. 3200rpm,
give or take, is 60mph. Same crowd on the road today. I wonder if that
Vanagon with the Porsche motor is going to fly by at 80+. Nope. Not today. I
notice the Porsches. My X-ray vision allows me to pour over the wonderful
motors. What's left of my sanity reminds me of what wifee-poo would do if I
even uttered the words &quot;Porsche motor&quot; and &quot;Itch&quot; in the same sentence.

8:24-&gt;8:30 Down Topanga Cyn. Same rule applied as to lane selection. The
snakers get pissed that they're reading my rear license plate again. I pull
into the parking lot at work - 1st gear at 2600rpm. Listen to that motor! I
park, give Itch a big hug, and make my egress.

5:00P - On the way home, it's pretty much the reverse, except I stay on the
freeway one off-ramp longer than when I entered the freeway this morning.
This stretch of freeway has two mean uphills, so as I'm still 3-4 miles from
here, and the semi trucks pass me, I get this evil smile on my face, knowing
we'll be seeing each other again... on our terms.
