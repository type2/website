Subject: opening stuck vent windows

hey now,

anyone got a good way to get a stuck vent window open? on the passenger side of
rumba the vent window knob/lever will move forward but not enough to get the
window open. take a mallet to it? i've already broken the #$%_at_ knob of the
vent window on the sliding door and don't want that to happen again.

thanks,

jonathan '74 Retrowestie (RuMbA)
