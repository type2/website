Subject: Re: [T2] Ign. Switch replaced, now starter failing

Don't neglect to check the ground strap at the trans. Make sure connections 
on both ends are tight and clean.  I found one with the same symptoms as 
described and found someone had used a rubber grommet to keep tension on the strap 
where bolted to the frame...  Removed the grommet, cleaned the connections, and 
replaced it with a washer.
