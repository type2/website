Subject: Camping at Bug Jam 97 (Dade City FL US)

Hiya Campers:

The official campground for this year's Bug Jam is (I hear from 
Larry Melgren) Campground Quail Run Campground (813) 973-0999.  From 
my digging online and in the DeLorme atlas, this puppy smells like an 
RV lot.  It appears to be 5-6 miles from the show.

I'm leaning more towards Hillsborough River State Park, which is 
pretty and has the advantage of being a whisker closer to Tampa -- my 
fantasy plan being to fahren down from Continental Florida to the 
campground Friday, visit the Bulli Brigade in Tampa on Sat (11/7), 
back to the campsite, and then up to Dade City for the show on Sunday 
(11/8), with a return trip to Tallahassee on Sunday 
afternoon/evening.

If you're interested in Hillsborough River State Park, check out 
http://tampa.info-access_dot_com/hills.htm.  The official park page has 
rates and phone numbers: 
http://www_dot_dep.state.fl_dot_us/parks/HillsboroughRiver/hillsboroughriver. 
html.  This is a pretty spot, one of Florida's very cool Civilian 
Conservation Corps-built locations.  Somehow it ain't camp without 
those log-and-limestone buildings.

If you want to coordinate caravaning and/or camping from the 
Tallahassee Quadrant, lemme know.
