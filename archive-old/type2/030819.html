Hi all, I'm new to the list, so I figured this would be as good a time as
any to jump in. My name is Beth, I am the owner of a 77 Westy and a 72 411
(my daily driver and the love of my life).

I live in Philadelphia and if you've ever been to this area in the dead of
summer you know that it's hotter than hell and breathing the humidity is
like trying to breath hot pea soup. Driving in a car or bus with no AC for
any length of time is like riding a sweatbox on wheels (especially in
rushhour traffic).

For the past year I've been thinking of putting in one of those
evaporative coolers that takes ice (without the ice, they're pretty
useless in humid weather). Only problem is is that they're expensive as
heck.

So, this afternoon I stopped at Home Depot on the way back from lunch with
a friend of mine. I waltzed into the ducting area and found a conical
reducer duct with a 2 inch tall by 10 inch long exit port on it's side. I
picked up another reducer that fits the round open end.

Forgive the ASCII art. It looks something like this when put together:

   ______/
  /
 /     __
 |    |  \

So, I figure, what they heck, it's 16 bucks total. If it won't fit, then I
just return it. Well, I got back to work, run out to my 411, crack open
the passengers side window and *tada* it fits right in perfectly. My guess
is that it should fit right into the bus no problem (actually probably
better since the 411 window is a little weird)

So, this is what I'm thinking:

First, I'll need something to put the ice in. I'm thinking of rigging
something that will hold Frozen Evian bottles (filled with tap water of
course ;) ) inside. Kinda pointless just redirecting hot air into my face.
I'm still working on this, but I'm leaning towards mounting some heavy
foam stoppers that will keep the bottle snug and in place although as the
ice melts the bottle will get a little less snug.

I have a small fan that I can hook up to an DC/AC converter that hooks up
to the cigarette lighter, reverse the polarity so the motor sucks air in
(or just mount it backwards) and mount it on the open end. That will also
give me some amount of screen for the little buggies I'll end up scooping
up while driving.

Now, as for keeping it mounted to the car. The outlet port is pretty
flimsy. I'm thinking of how I'm going to get this so it doesn't go wizzing
out my window while going 60 mph. I'm leaning towards mounting some Bug
fender beading around it or something so it has some way of catching the
window. Anyone have any ideas/suggestions (besides stop being cheap and
buy a real evap cooler)?

-Beth
