Subject: fuel tank for free in the bay area for a vanagon 83 !!!

I have a fuel tank for free for a Vanagon 83 ,  if you are somewhere in 
the bay area, I am locate to  Daly City pretty close  to  SF.
the fuel tank is  in a really good shape , the only thing is that it is 
now rusty inside  because I stupidly try to check if it has a leak with 
guess what ?  ... water !!!
I know , I know !! shame on me , now I learn .....

I also have the filler neck which go with !!!!

I can send some pic if interested , but again , it it in a very good shape

Chris
