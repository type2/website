List-
My summer project has been to try and put together a Bus for the winter so
my other Bus, a 72, that is in fine original condition can stay away from
the ice and snow and salt. I found a 72 Westy with a blown engine and a 1.8
L engine to replace it. It is all together, tuned up and running. I
reconnected the idleing system and adjusted the carbs and I think it runs
very well.  However, I think I can hear a slight knock. It seems to come
and go and I'm not sure it is from inside the engine. If there was a rod
knock how long would it take to get bad enough to be unmistakable?  At what
RPM would it be most noticable?  What else could it be?  I have adjusted
the valves and the carbs work fine. Static timing about 7 degrees BTDC.
When I turn the engine back and forth by hand I can't hear anything too
definite. Also It seems to run hot and the knocking is noticable when it is
warmed up. Could it be predetonation? Is there a way to clean the crud from
the cooling fins?
 You may have seen my previous message about looking for another engine. I
may be jumping the gun and should be sure before I do anything else. This
engine was dirty inside and out but the compression test was good and the
bottom end of these engines are known to be very strong, otherwise I don't
know the history of it.
What can I do to pin point the problem if there really is one?
Thank you,
John Ingram
