Sounds like a good deal but always try to &quot;talk them down&quot;  after all, all
they can do is tell you no!  The engine should be the least of your worries
with this bus.  If there is a good body, the engine can be removed and/or
fixed.  There is enough helpful hands on this list to guide you through
anything.  Parts come sliding in for sale and trade on good days.  I don't
post much but I read everything that comes through on this list and
hopefully, one day, maybe, it will sink in and I will be self sufficient!

Good luck!

&gt; Hello All. I'm a new subscriber to this list so I wanted to introduce
&gt; myself. I'm Meredith Murray and my wife is Debbie. I am currently on the
&gt; vintage bus list because I have a 64 Single cab and a 63 DLX hardtop.
&gt; The reason for my visit to this list is to gather information on a 1972
&gt; westy that I might be able to acquire. I haven't talked to the owners yet,
&gt; but someone who was looking at it said the only thing wrong with it was
the
&gt; engine. I know I have heard of a bastard engine around this time, which
year
&gt; was it and what was the problem?
&gt; The bus is in good shape just looking at it on the surface. It is a hard
top
&gt; westy with a walk thru seat. It still even has the child cot, and all of
the
&gt; interior parts.
&gt; The guy that was looking at it said the owners wanted $500.00 for it. Is
&gt; this a fair price for that year bus with a bad motor? Also could someone
&gt; give me an idea on the price of a complete brake job, thetas parts only
&gt; because I can do the job myself. Also what does a Tranny go for for that
&gt; year in case this one is bad?
&gt; I know I will need cosmetics on the outside, but the inside is in great
&gt; shape!
&gt; Any other advice on things to look out for or be aware of? Thanks for any
&gt; advice someone could give, because it might be time for my first non split
&gt; bus.
&gt; Thanks again.
