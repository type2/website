&gt;Picture #5 (fuel leak)

&gt;Benoit, there is *NO SUCH THING* as a &quot;small&quot; fuel leak!!!!  That small
&gt;leak today may toast your bus tomorrow.  The spot you are pointing to in
&gt;the picture is the junction between the carb and the intake manifold.
&gt;First, that should be a near perfect seal, certainly air (and thus fuel)
&gt;tight.  if fuel is coming out there, then it is dripping down the throat
&gt;of the carb, a bad thing and you also have a vacuum leak, also a bad
&gt;thing. It is time to remove and rehab that carb.

I should add that when I removed my Solex carbs to clean/service them (not 
the first time, but maybe the fourth or fifth time &lt;g&gt;) I found that thanks 
to the wonderful pot-metal construction of the carbs and perhaps to the 
carb attachment bolts being over-torqued at one point in their lives, the 
bottoms of the carbs were no longer flat, but bowed up in the middle, thus 
allowing the fuel leak which I had also seen on my carbs.  I put the 
inverted carb body in a vice and filed the bottom flange until it was 
completely flat again which, together with new gaskets, took care of the 
leak from that area.
