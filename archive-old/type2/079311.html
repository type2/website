Subject: REMINDER: 1 week to get to Arizona, BBB IV campout - January 19 a
	nd 20


I updated the BBB VI web page, I believe all the info I could find is now
published :)

  http://www.OldVolks_dot_com/Events/BBB/2002/

Everything about the event is on that page, including schedules, fees, links
to campground directions, etc.

Photos, Photos, Photos
====================
This year, as in the past two years, we will be doing updates of the web
site with PHOTOS throughout the event!  Thanks to No Quarter for doing the
great shots last year!

This year I will be there in person - it should be even more &quot;real time&quot;
than ever, as we will have cell phone internet access (love those &quot;Night and
Weekend plans&quot;, both Verizon and Sprint cell phones allow Internet Access
from the site of the campground).  We even have a 802.11b 11Mbps network
option, but I haven't found a use for it yet :)

I will have my 35' Mobile Office (1991 Coachman RV) there along with my 1967
Westy - so I shouldn't be hard to find.  If you have a digital camera that
uses Compact Flash - I can upload them from the site.  I have USB capability
on my laptop, so should be able to handle SmartMedia or direct link to
cameras.

See you all there!
