&gt; &gt;I've just been out and bought a new stereo system for my camper
&gt; &gt;conversion '68 type 2 - my question is...
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;       1: what speaker set-up can you recomend
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;       2: where would you put the speakers
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;I want to get as good a sound as possible up front (the camper is open
&gt; &gt;pla &amp; walk through) - and to get e goo sound when I'm up back....
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Any ideas will be greatly appreciated...
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Thanks in advance,
&gt; &gt;

&gt; Hi Jonathan,
&gt; 
&gt; I've got mine in the front wall (5.25's).  In mine there's an
&gt; under last rear seat area with a cardboard wall along the bottom.
&gt; That's where I'll put mine.
&gt; 
&gt; BTW, the speakers will sound better if they are in &quot;phase&quot;.
&gt; 
&gt; 1) Hook up one speaker, leave the wires to the 2nd unhooked.
&gt; 
&gt; 2) Put on an album with a lotta bass.  Try the 2nd speaker wires
&gt;    both ways.  When the phase is right, the speakers will boom
&gt;    the bass *together* in a pulse effect.  You'll also hear it,
&gt;    and, if loud enough - you'll feel it !
&gt; 
&gt; As for the rears in yours, after phasing, (with lots of wire), move
&gt; 'em around while playing some music.  Sit in front and listen.  There
&gt; will be 2 spots where you'll like them most.  This is the &quot;Zen&quot; method.
&gt; 
&gt; Hope This Helps,

John,

WOW!  Sounds good - didn't realise that this would be so complicated
though!

I've been thinking about it today, and have talked with the guy in the
shop, and I think that I'm goin to go for the following layout;


                                  FRONT
                       +--------------------------+
                      /                            \
                     /                              \
                    +-----------+        +-----------+
door 2-way--------&gt; !   seat    |        |    seat   ! &lt;------ door

                    !___________+        +___________!
                    |           |        |           |
                    |   seat    |        |    seat   |
                    +-----------+        +-----------+
                    |                                |

                    |                                |
                    |                                |
                    |                                | &lt;------ above bed

       4&quot;           |                                | 
                    +                                +
                     \                              /
                      +----------------------------+


The 2-way's have built in speakers (or so they tell me), and are quite
reasonably priced...they sounded good in the shop too.  
Above the bed I have a cupboard mounted to the roof....in this I plan to
mount the 4&quot; speakers to the front, and put the CD changer inside.

Sounds good to me, but then, what do I know...?!!

Any comments?

Jonathan.
