I don't jack up my bus to change the oil and filter.

&gt;    Another thing, IMHO, I don't think much of those drive on ramps, since
&gt;you can only really see the left one, its to easy to get off center on the
&gt;other and have one roll over.

Just angle the passenger side mirror so you can see the other one.

It's sometimes a little difficult to get up on those Rhino ramps that stores sell. I made a set of lower profile ramps out of 2x4s a number of years back:
