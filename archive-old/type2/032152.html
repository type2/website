Subject: Re: Theft prevention

My take on auto theft prevention is that it's mostly an exercise in
futility.  Door locks keep the curious and causal thieves out, but someone
who's really interested in stealing your radio or whatever will just smash
out a window.  It's quicker and more effective than any slim-jim or other
lockout tool.  A thief is after getting in and out quickly.  Car alarms
give a nice sense of security, but in practice false-trigger so often that
everyone ignores them.

If you're trying to keep someone from driving off with the van, anything
unexpected that slows the thief down may help.  Again, they want a quick
job so they don't get caught.  (I heard somewhere that a good thief can
break into a Mustang, hotwire it, and drive it off in under 30 seconds.)
There have been a couple stories posted here by people who found evidence
of someone trying to steal their van and giving up when it wouldn't start
-- how about an ignition or fuel pump cut-off switch in a concealed
location?  If you have a tach wired in, you're halfway there; merely
shorting the tach wire to ground will disable the ignition system.

Just a few thoughts.  I'm sure others will add their opinions.
