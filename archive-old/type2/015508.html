The question is, how many miles/hours has this motor been run? If your
motor was recently rebuilt, and you haven't put but break-in milage on it,
you could pull the motor and adjust the end play and save the value of the
rebuild, if the rest of it was in tolerance. If the builder can't get the
endplay right, what presumptions or assumptions might we make about the
rest of the specs ignored in it's assembly??

If, however, this is a high milage motor that has developed wear beyond
spec, it's long block time. If your anywhere near the NW, do yourself a
favor and buy a remanufactured spec motor from NW Con Rod, Seattle.
Rigourous people as to specifications and enhancement of same. Well worth
every dollar they need to do decent work every time.

Excess end play means every time you use the clutch, the crankshaft slips
back and forth. This misaligns the rods too much if the end play spec is
too much. The rod bearings wear excessively at their edges. Excessive end
play in new assemblies is the root of many 20k- life motors. 

Gee, if I spend twice as much for a 100k motor than I do for a 20k motor,
am I fool for value or what???

&gt;Hello all,
&gt;	I finally purchased a dial indicator yesterday to measure my
&gt;crankshaft endplay on my 1600 DP (the one I ordered from Harbor Freight
&gt;never came-ordered first week of January). The endplay measures 0.020. This
&gt;seems like a lot. Can this be shimmed? I really don't want to split the case
&gt;and rebuild this myself. Does anyone sell short blocks?  I am thinking of
&gt;just putting on my new heads, pistons and cylinders and just driving it for
&gt;a while. Spring fever  here in Massachusetts spreads quicker than foot and
&gt;mouth disease.
&gt;
&gt;Thanks in advance for your wise advise,
&gt;
&gt;Jeff
