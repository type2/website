Hey there Volks,

Yep, check for the vacuum leaks. Nothing can mess up a FI'ed motor
like a vacuum leak.

Also check to see if the flapper thingie (tech lingo) in the AFM is
stuck closed from the backfire. Remove the air filter assmbly and
filter and use a stick or really long screwdriver to make sure. You
may smell gas from when the starter is cranking, but if the flapper
is stuck, it'll never run. 

The fuel pump gets power from the double relay. The relay gets a
signal to send power to the fuel pump under 2 conditions. One - when
the starter is cranking and Two - when the is sufficient engine
vacuum to cause the flapper thingie to open. If either of these
conditions are not met the pump shouldn't work.

Just another thing to check, and the reason I have a long stick in my
bus.

HTH, YMMV, etc, etc
