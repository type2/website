&gt; Rhetorical question:  why are we thinking about
&gt; paying someone money (ms_dot_net) instead of getting
&gt; those services free from yahoo or someone else?
&gt; You could start a yahoo group, make an occasional
&gt; post to all the members to require them to
&gt; confirm and save the list as one of the files on
&gt; that part of the website.

because Yahoo isn't free.

you agree when you join yahoo to let em send ads, ie:spam and it is very
hard to opt out.

also not everyone can use yahoo groups
also if you are not using your home address you can't log into yahoo
groups

personally if it goes on yahoo groups I will probably drop off because I
cannot access yahoo groups at all myself, so I will be back where I
started, driving solo.

&gt; I like free.
