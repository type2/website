&gt; To rephrase: With the crank end of the rod held in one place the piston 
&gt; end of the rod can be moved fore and aft about 2-3mm. 

I think I see what you are doing.
Ignore the non-technical approach and
put a feeler gauge between the rod and the crank.
The exaggerated lever effect is not accurate.
