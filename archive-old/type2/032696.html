Greetings -

And welcome to bus-wheel hell...

I guess I didn't quite get the year of the breadloaf.

The 68-70's (drum brakes all around) use the wide-5 bolt pattern, and I've
heard that the pre-68 15&quot; wheel are a direct fit. Anybody heard different?

The disk brake models have 112mm diameter lugs. A wheel book I saw showed
only Audi Turbo and Mercedes wheels as a identical fit, though I don't have
the data on the wheel offset.

Be careful of the American 4-1/2&quot; wheel patterns!! That translates to
114.3mm, and may &quot;look&quot; right if you try to physically mount a wheel on the
hub, but would certainly cause some sort of bad things while under load.

If you're looking to create taller gearing, there's a &quot;baja bus&quot; article in
TYPE2 that says 215*75/14 should fit front and 225*75 in back. Those rears
would yield a calculation of 678mm diameter tire, as opposed to 633mm for a
more popular 185*75 - a 7% (speed increase / rpm decrease) difference. I
would be more inclined to play it safe, and put 205*75's all around, for
663mm and a 5% difference.

Good luck -

&gt; Hi,
&gt;
&gt; &gt; Anybody have any experience with converting to 15 inch wheels on a
&gt; breadloaf?
&gt;
&gt;  I'm part-way through doing so. Finding it something of a PITA.
&gt;
&gt; &gt; An on-
&gt; &gt; line wheel source indicated Mercedes Benz wheel code et37 6.5 x 15 h2
&gt; , but
&gt; &gt; didn't
&gt; &gt; reveal what model(s) or years.
&gt;
&gt;  I havn't been able to pin this down, either. It doesn't seem to be
&gt; easy to
&gt; find this information for some reason. I would have thought that it was
&gt; tabulated by some MB enthusiasts somewhere, but if so I've yet to come
&gt; across it.
&gt;
&gt; &gt;  Any other wheels (available from the local recycler,
&gt;
&gt;  Some, but none that seem to be a bolt-up. Some big Audis (200) use the
&gt; same bolt pattern but apparently need the centre reaming.
&gt;
&gt; &gt; please), with the correct offset and bolt pattern. Some machining can
&gt; be
&gt; &gt; done en-larging the center hole). I'm not looking for custom alloys,
&gt; just
&gt; &gt; a set of stock wheels to utilize 15 inch tires.
&gt;
&gt;  There do seem to be some 15&quot; Merc wheels that do bolt up: certainly the
&gt; ones I have have the correct pcd and a correctable offset, however the
&gt; mounting surface (land?) is much thicker than the VW wheels, so I am
&gt; currently sourcing longer hub studs to enable me to fit them.
&gt;  I have also had to get the mounting holes drilled out to clear the
&gt; 14mm studs, as Mercedes were using 12mm bolts for these wheels.
&gt;
&gt;  There are some earlier Merc wheels that were 14&quot; and were purported
&gt; to be a direct fitment. I think that there may be others available in
&gt; a 15&quot; size that have a thinner mounting face, allowing use of the
&gt; stock studs. I don't know which cars they would have been fitted to,
&gt; though, and I don't think anyone else on the list does either, since
&gt; this question has been asked repeatedly but an answer has never
&gt; emerged.
&gt;  Someone (Karl von Salzen, I think) posted a list of offsets and models
&gt; for many Mercedes (it's in the archives, let me/us know if you can't
&gt; find it) but that doesn't address the bolt-hole/land thickness issue.
&gt;
&gt; &gt; Thanks in advance.
&gt;
&gt;  Sorry I can't be more help.
&gt;
&gt; Cheers,
&gt; W.
