Subject: Re: [T2] MAX out your Propane Capacity / Do propane tanks HAVE to
	be Cylindrical?

In the latest issue of Transporter Talk, the UK's type 2 owners club
magazine (that arrived this morning), there is a letter from a guy who
converted a 1987 Syncro using 2 tanks underneath the chassis.  This was
helped by the extra ground clearance on the Syncro.  There is no contact
number or email with the letter.  He doesn't say how big the tanks were or
how much range he gets.
