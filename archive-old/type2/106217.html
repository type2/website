OK, now I have to ask:  How do you measure decibels???

I thought a decibels were a measure of the loudness of sound, and that sound 
would be twice as loud with every  X___X  number of decibels increased??

I need this info so I can know how to measure the 'decibels' on my  air 
cooled VW type 2 HORN..  &lt;&lt;-RBC
