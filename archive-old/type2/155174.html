Subject: Factory holes in cargo area floor pan

Hi All, 

In trying to track down some leaks in my '77 bus, I pulled out the
carpet and rubber mat in the cargo area.  To my surprise, I found 2
factory holes in the floor pan.  One is just behind the driver's
pedestal, and the other is near the passenger-side bolt-down location
for the middle seat.    Both holes are around 2&quot; in diameter.  The one
on the diver's side goes straight down, whilst the one on the passenger
side angles forward.  One of the old AC lines that was cut is tucked up
in the passenger side hole.  

What were those holes for?  They look either factory, or professionally
done.   

Thanks!

Shad H.
