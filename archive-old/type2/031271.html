&gt; I just removed the auxiliary aire regulator (valve?) from my 78 EFI.
&gt; There is a small rubber elbow attached to it, about half an inch in

&gt; engine stops after 30 seconds unless I unplug the AFM. Would that black

welcome to the world of &quot;Scrounge&quot; this part is a NLA from any source, as
are many of the vacuum and air lines in the Fuel Injected engine.

you now get to test your ability to cobble something up that will work.
actually that part is not too hard.

before I found a junkyard one I fixed mine by wrapping a layer or two of
metal heating duct tape around it and a few small wire ties to hold it all
together.
