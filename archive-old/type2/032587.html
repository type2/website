Subject: switch to elec ignition?
Content-Disposition: Inline

Hey all... so I have a '82 brick Westie 2LFi.  So I'm thinkin' about
swapping out the points, etc for an electronic ignition system.  Any
comments on this one?  Good thing or not?  And is there a consensus on a
brand preference on the conversion?

Thanks again; you've been more helpful than you imagine over the years.

Kevin
