Subject: My Bus runs, but then dies after a few minutes

I have a '78 VW Camper that I've owned for only a couple of months, and
it's done well up until the past few weeks.  I start it up and it runs
fine for a couple of minutes, and then it'll die.  Sometimes it's when I
give it gas, it sounds like the engine bogs down, and then I can't start
it again for a while.  At first I thought it was the cold up here, but
the fact that it starts seems to indicate that it isn't that.  The
battery is almost dying because of all the times I try to turn it over.
So, I'm trying to get it running so I can get home for winter break.  If
anyone has any suggestions I would love to hear them.

Bryan
