Subject: Re: [T2] AC (sort of) for Busses

&gt; Has anyone tried this KoolerAire thing - a fan lid for an ice chest?  
&gt; It sounds good - in fact, I already ordered one.  I just heard of it,  
&gt; and I would guess that many air-coolers haven't yet.

Let us know if its doing anything good because I have some doubt that it 
is going to drop the temperature significantly. I think I would rather 
use the ice to keep my beers cold!   ;-))
