Subject: Looking to purchase a Z-bed at EB

     If all goes well and I can get it ready (and I think it will) I'll be 
piloting my 74 standard bus down to NC for EB next weekend.  I will be 
bringing along an air mattress, just in case, but I am really hoping to buy 
a Z-bed when I get there and install it on Saturday.  I thought I might just 
do a bit of work now to try and make sure I have one to buy when I get 
there, if possible.  If you have a decent Z-bed that you can bring with you 
to sell me, please let me know!
