Subject: Ya gadda bumper for an ugly '71 Westy?

Hi all,

Just wondering - what's the going rate for bumpers? I've been wrestling
with my ugly, rusty, dented front bumper all morning trying to get it
back on the brackets, and I'm thinking a new (or better) one might be in
order. 

On a related thingy - are the bumper - whatchamacallits -
riser/protector thingys on my '71 original? I just removed them because
they were in such sorry shape,and it occured to me that I never see them
on other buses - they all seem to have the &quot;smile&quot; without the
&quot;fangs&quot;...

Headed back out to the lot,

Tony
