Subject: Re: [T2] Sudden loss of Door trigger Function

In a message dated 11/12/02 7:08:45 AM, tigger_at_neale_dot_org writes:

&lt;&lt; Soooo, my question is, is the door release trigger mechanism likely to be
broken, and hence the door handle will need replacing, or is there any chance
that something's just come loose, and I'll be able to put it back, together
properly when I pull the door handle off? ( Obviously, the latter would be
preferred, but if I need to start chasing parts it'd be good to know ASAP. )
 &gt;&gt;

Probably the same thing that happened to mine...There's a horseshoe
shape at the other end of the trigger. Mine broke at its pivot point.
It's obvious once you remove the handle and easy enough to replace,
if you have another trigger...
