Hello all,

Picked this off the net, sounds like the greatest thing
since sliced bread.  I didn't write it credits included.

HEATGARD

Avoid expensive engine damage with this homemade monitoring device

by Glen Deibert
&lt;published in Motorhome magazine, but i can't tell which year/month&gt;

When I asked my wife and son how often they monitor the instrument
gauges while driving our motorhome, I got two blank looks.  This is
probably true for many drivers.  Gauges should alert the driver that
something is happening, but by the time they are noticed, damage may
already have occurred.  Even &quot;idiot lights&quot; can go unnoticed until it
is too late.

Most drivers cannot constantly monitor their instruments, especially
in traffic or on winding roads.  However, heat damage can rapidly
occur during high-load conditions, such as hill climbing or towing
(especially if the engine air conditioner is on).  Damaging temperatures
can also be quickly reached if there is a failure in any part of the
cooling system.  Loss of oil pressure will have a secondary effect of
an increase in engine temperature.

I have designed a device I call &quot;Heatgard&quot; that supplements the
coolant's temperature guage on my motorhome.  Heatgard constantly
monitors my engine electronically for high-coolant temperatures.  It
relieves a driver of constantly monitoring coolant temperature and is
especially usedful when traveling in a scenic or busy area where the
driver cannot look away from the road to glance at the instrument
panel.  The monitor does it for you.

Description
The monitoring circuit uses two Snap Action thermal switches (also
known as sensors), which are glued to the rear of one of the engine's
cylinder heads (this should be the hot spot of the engine).  The sensors
monitor for two different temperatures.

One of the thermal switches will close when the lower of two
temperatures is reached, causing a red light-emitting diode (LED) on
the monitor panel to flash.  If the driver doesn't catch this warning
and take appropriate action, the second switch closes when the higher
temperature is reached (this causes a second red LED to illuminate
steadily and activates a two-tone audible alarm).  The driver is thus
alerted that it is time to take immediate action or suffer engine
damage.

The maximum, or red line, reading for the existing coolant temperature
gauge is 265 degrees F.  An actuating temperature of 248 degrees F was
selected for the flashing LED and 257 degrees for the audible/visual
alarm.  With these temperature limits, you should have a little time
to start doing something to decrease the coolant temperature.  This can
include immedicately turning on the heater (not defroster) full blast,
and taking the load off the engine by pulling off the road and letting
the engine run at a high idle in park.  Do not turn the engine off
until you check for coolant loss.

When the rig is safely away from traffic, immediately look under the
engine for coolant loss.  If you see fluid pouring down, or smell the
characteristic odor of hot coolant, it is probable that you have a
leak.  If you have lost a lot of coolant, idling will not help cool
the engine.  In this case, shut down the engine right away.  If the
electric auxiliary cooling fan only runs when the key is on, leave the
ignition switch in the run position after the engine stops ... this
may help cool the system.

Circuit Design
Upon starting the vehicle, with the ignition switch on, the system's
green LED will illuminate to indicate the circuit is functional.  This
is the ony LED that should ever illuminate unless there is an over-
heating condition.  If 248 degrees F is reached, the first LED will
flash.  This indicates the engine temperature is approaching an unsafe
operating range.  The drive can then take appropriate action to lower
the temperature.  As the temperature reaches approximately 257 degrees
F, the second LED and an pulsating audible alarm activates.  Immediate
action must be taken to prevent engine damage.

Snap Action switches are available with various temperature settings.
We selected the switch temperature ratings based on a coolant 50/50
percent mixture of water and antifreeze and a 15-psi radiator cap,
which is the most common setup.  This gives a boiling point of about
260 degrees F.

There is a time lag for the thermal switch to reset when the engine
temperature is reduced.  After taking action to reduce engine
temperature, the driver may turn off the circuit to silence the alarm,
but continue to monitor the gauge.

Installation
The three wires should be connected to the thermal switches before they
are attached to the cylinder heads.  Do this to ensure that you have
the correct switch connected to the correct wire.

Working in the engine compartment, choose a flat spot near the rear
of a cylinder head that is away from the exhaust manifold and clean
the spot thoroughly.  Apply  Delta Bond adhesive  (or equivalent) to
this spot and push the Snap Action switch into the adhesive.  Form
the adhesive to hold the switch securely to the cylinder head.  Ensure
that the flat part of the Snap Action switch is tight against the
cylinder head.  Allow the adhesive to dry several hours before starting
the engine.  (NOTE: Products other than Delta Bond thermal adhesive,
such as JB Weld, might work; however, these may not transfer heat as
well.)

In addition to the items shown in the parts list, you will need some
lightweight wire (18 or 20 gauge) and some connectors.  Although some
skill and basic electrical tools are required to construct this circuit,
all wiring is straightforward.  The only critical area is connecting
the LEDs and the alarm.  They are polarity-sensitive, and, to function,
they must be wired as shown in Figures 1A and 1B.

After the circuit is built, it may be tested by applying power from a
9-volt battery to the power and ground wires.  Figure 3 shows how to
short the leads to check the action of the LEDs.  Turn on the Heatgard
and momentarily short together the three leads that will be fastened
to the thermal switches ... both red and green LEDs should light and
the audible alarm should sound.  Then, short out the higher temperature
switch ... the nonflashing LED should light and the audible alarm
should sound.

Mounting Display
Mount the monitor display panel under the edge of the dash or at any
other convenient location that is readily visible to the driver.  Attach
the monitor panel with adhesive hook and loop fasteners or a general-
purpose adhesive such as  Goop.

Construct the monitor panel from a small plastic box or scraps from the
parts bin.  We made our monitor display panel from a 3-inch long scrap
section of a plastic rain gutter downspout.  Cut until you get a 90
degree angle mount, then fasten the completed Heatgard to the chosen
location.  If plastic downspout is not available, it should not be
too difficult to obtain a plastic box that will allow mounting of the
electrical parts and mounting to the dashboard.

The completed unit should have five wires coming from it.  Three will
go to the thermal switches, one to a ground and one to ignition-switched
12 volts DC. Next, route the wiring to the vehicle fuse block for power
and ground, and to the engine compartment for connecting to the thermal
switches.  Connect all wires according to the circuit diagram and you
are finished.

Alternative Display
Figures 2A and 2B show a simpler circuit for those who don't feel that
they need two warning LEDs and an audible alarm.  This monitor uses the
audible alarm only and a green LED to show that the ciruict is active.
