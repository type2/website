Subject: Trip Report: Back in the States!

Hey now,
     We're back! We camped in Hope, BC on 10 August with Bob Hoover, then hit
Vancouver to get some things we'd left at Tobin's place-a big thanks to Tobin
&amp; Christa for letting us take thier keys to get in!  Bob again showed his
flair for excellence with an incredibally tasty meal. He's the only person I
know who can take canned food and doctor it up to be a real gormet meal...
     So after getting our goodies from Tobin &amp; Christa's place, we met up
with Bob at the border, and crossed over. Everyone said that usually US
customs were a pain, but the guy just asked what we had, we said lettuce, and
he said &quot;Go&quot;. Easy. 
     After crossing the border we continued south to Johnny Stutsman's place,
and Bob continued south at his usual stately pace (read: 50 mph). Johnny
lives in Seattle, which was very convenient since we had to pick up Sam at
SEA-TAC.
     We spent the evening and most of the next day with Johnny. His wife was
out of town, so he was home to watch his 2 adorable kids, and chat with us
too...  Johnny's hospitality was wonderful, he had 2 loaves of fresh homemade
bread, and lots of delicious homebrew to drink. We spent the afternoon
discussing the merits of westys, splitties, baywindows, oil coolers, and all
kinds of other VW stuff. My Dad just sort of seemed glassy eyed...   ;-)
     So we picked up Sam at 4:30, and Sam &amp; I cuddled in the back of the bus
all the way to Spokane-3 weeks is a long time to be apart. Indra was really
happy to see her mom back too...  ;-) Sam &amp;I have been really happy to be
back together, even though we've been feeling the strain of lack of funds.
Hopefully we'll be able to find a few more places to stay before we get to
New Mexico, since we only have about $300 to get home on-with an estimated
gas cost of about $200.  It's a bummer being poor...
     So we're in Spokane today-13 August. We're staying with Randy Bolster, a
major player in my dad's software company. The Bolster's have been
wonderfully receptive to us, and cooked a great meal for dinner tonight.
Thier house is really something spectacular, with 3 stories, and all kinds of
room for thier 5 kids-2 adopted. Linda Bolster said earlier today that they
also often take in refugee families and the like. Nice people. 
     We went out this afternoon doing the tourist thing, and I saw a place
called &quot;that's all Volks&quot;, with about 7 busses parked out front. Of course,
we had to stop... ;-) Got a little excited for a couple of hours there-they
have a '65 kombi they're selling for $600, engine included, not running but
supposedly rebulidable. A precursory inspection revealed no major problems,
and we started thinking about good uses for the spare engine we have with us.
;-)  We only had about 5 minutes to look though, since we had to be back in
time for dinner, so I went back after dinner to go over it more closely, and
that's when I found that there was some pretty major floorboard rust, and
quite a few parts missing as well. If it was a westy, I might have bought it
anyway, but it wasn't so I didn't. 
     So tomorrow we will head for Montana, and likely end up in Yellowstone,
although Sam &amp; I have yet to find a place to stay. We'll be planning after I
send this out. However, because of the financial scene we will likely be home
in the next week or so. We shall see. For now, it's just business as
usual-many miles to drive...
Peace,
Eddie
