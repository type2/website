&gt;I looked into the website more to see what I could find out about 
&gt;FR12.  It sounds like pretty good stuff.  They say its not flammable 
&gt;either, which is one of the main things.  It doesn't require the higher 
&gt;pressures that R134a runs on either, which is a bonus.

FYI, I have not seen &quot;higher&quot; pressures with 134a.  Mine tops out at about 
250psi in the bus (I've seen 300 on the Mustang's R12 system) and cools 
just fine.  Maybe it's a result of the much larger system on a bus?  Not 
sure, but I wouldn't let worries about higher pressures stop me from 
converting to 134a.

As for FR12 (This is the same as freeze-12 right?) I have a friend who just 
echoed everything that Ronnie just said about it.  As a result, I am going 
to try it in the Mustang this weekend to replace the R12 that leaked out 
recently.  I'll share my results if anyone's interested.
