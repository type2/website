Subject: Re: [T2] Just finished (mostly) my paint job...

I don't know, its kind of bland and drab. Couldn't think of a colorful paint
scheme?

I LIKE IT.................. I knew the 60's would come back, but where are
the Butterflies and peace sign? :-)         Now where did I put that
&quot;SPECIAL&quot; recipe for brownies?

Aha to be 18 again!
