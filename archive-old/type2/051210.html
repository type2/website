&gt;My folks will be retiring next year and moving from Germany to the US
(Wisconsin).  They would like to bring their '94 Eurovan Westfalia to the
States with them.  It is a German-spec camper, 2.0 4-cylinder 5-speed,
&quot;California Coach&quot; model.  

So, that's what's called a grey market car, once it hits a US beach. Others
will know better, but the 94 was about the 2nd or 3rd OBD I spec car. Both
US and German cars meet OBD I spec. I don't know that there was any special
Cal spec for the US. You California Campers will know. I believe OBD I spec
cars qualify for 50 state registration. OBD spec is a world spec flowing
from the first two decades of US specs. What you need to know is, did it
come with reinforced doors?? Not needed if your state says it's a truck or
something other than a car, rule of thumb. That cost should be known if
it's at issue as it takes real money to really do it rightly. 

Is a German 94 engine spec the same as a US 94 spec engine???? What are the
differences, if any??
Surely, try surfing the EPA for 94 US specs. The occasional friendly dealer
parts man/woman may have the answer. OBDII systems started a year or two
later. Engines for most of the European, US and Japanese production meet
world OBDII spec after this third iteration of automotive computer control
was incorporated. You still might have structural variations. 

Grey market cars of the 80's are a pain because they have too many
unobtainium parts, unless your brother in law is named Gunther and lives
near Studtgardtenburg. This is not nearly the issue on a 94, but you should
verify whether door structual beams must be installed or if the German spec
engine uses the same ECU as the US spec. If it's the same part number, then
any required update or revision will be minor indeed, I mean hundreds tops
not thousands. If not, know the cost before saying, &quot;We can't live without
OUR bus, even if it jepardizes our sence of budget realities.&quot; OBD I ECU's
run a grand more or less. OBDII ECU's run $1500 to $3500, and most have at
least two major ECU's.

In the 80's, at least 3 out of 5 grey market cars that got converted were
done in poor fashion, as cheap as possible, adding no real value, but at
minimal cost to sneak under the EPA paperwork. Many from that era had
nighmares of problems getting parts and finding someone who knows of the
grey market issues and will agree to work on them. God help them if they
let Uncle Mort fixit at the Kubota shop.

Tell them to pack a carton or two of genuine maintenance parts with the bus
when they ship it, filters, hoses and such. As a 94 all those hoses may be
original and in servicable order for the time being, but likely will be
needed in just a few years. I'm just guessing the price when converted
would be lower than buying here. May as well insure a long life with good
value for real parts that you know you will have need of.
