&gt; I think I get frustrated because I can't explain to the impatient
&gt; drivers that I'm going as fast as I can!  I recently saw a bumper

I saw a sign in the rear window of a '66 once that I've thought about
making for my van. It said: 

MY FAST = YOUR SLOW
PASS WITH A SMILE!

   &quot;I'd like to make the midterm [exam] essay, but I've read essays
    written by engineers and it's not pretty.&quot;  -- J. Sutherland, ME464
