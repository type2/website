What

On a scale of 1-10, 1 being replacing a T-IV altunator and 10 doing a
complete restoration, this swap would be a 12. It cannot be Neandereered.
It's a job for a team of Cro-Magnoneers. And they're 'very' spendy.  

Motor mounts must be custom designed and fabricated. Cooling tin must be
custom designed and fabricated. Both will require REAL jouneyman skill and
experience with a true love of adventure, not just someone with a green card.
