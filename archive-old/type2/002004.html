&gt; I am a new subscriber to the digest.  I have been
&gt; having a problem with my Dual relay on a 1982
&gt; Westfalia.  When I disconnect the dual relay from the
&gt; fire wall, my van starts and continues running.
&gt; However, when I attempt to connect it to the fire wall
&gt; via the metal screw, then engines dies.
&gt;
&gt; Not being an electrical engineer, I understand this to
&gt; be a grounding problem, but my expertise ends here.
&gt; Anyone have a similar problem?  I am beginning to
&gt; think the dual relay my be ok but that the wires that
&gt; plug in  are the culprit.  Any help appreciated.  Thanks!

I believe you have a bad double relay. The new replacement has a plastic
case, so it doesn't need to be grounded or even mounted to work. Replace
your relay.
