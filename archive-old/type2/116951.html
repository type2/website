Subject: warped flywheel? on 76 bus

They are at the Depot as well, look under kits or click the &quot;expanded listing&quot; button when you come to the end of the listings. Or search by part number from the main screen. Ask for your 5% listmember discount for orders over 50 bucks.

Also, where are you in the country?

Busboys carries all this stuff and you could save on shipping if you are west-coastal. I find their prices to be a little lower on most items also. Also, when you call busboys you get busdriver level help, not an answering person.
