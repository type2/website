Subject: Distributors

Hi All,

So, all this distributor talk has got me thinking about a few things, which
raises a couple of questions. Since the distributor only fits in one way, I
can just pull it out and re-install any old time without worrying about
orientation, right? I have a 70 with the original 1600 single port, but it
has an 009 mechanical advance on it. I picked up a used vacuum
advance/retard dizzy with a bunch of other parts a while back, and have been
itching to try it out, but have not for fear of getting everything back
together right. is it really just drop it in and re-time? Makes sense, but I
need a little reassurance here. Also, most other stock 70's I have seen have
only a vacuum advance. Can I even use this advance/retard dizzy? Should I
only use the advance side and not hook up the retard? Any tips on where to
hook up the vacuum lines on the carb/manifold and what to time it at? All
these dizzy questions this early in the morning are starting to make me
dizzy. Oh well, thanks for any info the wise list can supply.

Jeff
