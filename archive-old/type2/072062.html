Subject: por-15

we're back on the por-15 subject? my experience this week: the factory put
some pints of clear in cans called silver, and i tell ya, clear painted on
the inside REally stinks. why, i am still mezmorized. windows and doors
have been open for the whole week, and its never going away until i top
coat it with something (prolly my free can of silver...if'n that's what's
in there). moral of the story - try to get a supplier who can take back
mistakes.  i used the black earlier, and that didn't smell at all after a
few hours. and the por-putty might be fun for narrow rust spots. less is
more. you can build it up which is more fun than removing.  a respirator is
essential. por must stand for plastic over rust ;)          - steve
