Subject: Re: [T2] DIPSTICK GASKET LEAK

Darren,

&quot;librarian's&quot; comments are exactly correct.

It is probably easier to replace this way than trying to &quot;stab&quot; it on
correctly when you install the fan shroud.

You need to crawl under your bus with a flashlight, a couple of
old rags, a new &quot;bellows&quot;...and just get with it...count on getting
dirty...it does wash off though!...and it probably is better if 
you don't have really fat fingers like me!

Unless I have forgotten something, nothing but maybe a pair of long
nose pliers are necessary....maybe.

Cheers, dave

&gt; Hello,
&gt; 'librarian' recently posted a note regarding the dipstick gasket leak and
&gt; how to repair.
&gt; just wondering if anyone has repaced this, and if there is another method to
&gt; fix this leak
&gt; other than the bellow and if you need to remove the tin and alternator belt?
&gt; Thanks muchly.
&gt; (my van is a 72 with a 75 1800 engine.
&gt; the oil seems to be leaking onto the tin below the dipstick.)
