Hi Volks,

a little belatedly I've done a flyer for you to put in the back 
window of your bus on Drive Your VW to Work Day tomorrow.  It shows a 
blue early bay Kombi (as seen on my club's web site) with the 
appropriate inscription below.  To download, go to

and select colour or greyscale and size to fit your needs.  Sorry 
about this being so late, it didn't ever occur to me until last 
night.

Have fun!

Yours,
    Erik.
