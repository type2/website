&gt; I had the same problem this summer. What would make a pilot bearing fail so
&gt; completely? 

The usual suspect... lack of lubrication.  Every time you have the engine
out, you have to lay a lump of grease in there.  While it is not suficient
cause to pull an engine, I would say that every 50K or so, this is a &quot;must
do.&quot;  For me, getting to 50K w/o an engine pull is usually way more of a
problem than failing to lube the bearing :-)
