&gt; San Francisco Auto Repair Center offers Volkswagon repair classes, taught by
&gt; their 35-yrs experienced mechanic. There's one beginning September 10, and
&gt; one in November. Five 3-hour classes, meet on Tuesday evenings. Cost is $75.
&gt; The class covers the basics for all air-cooled VWs. 

Wow would I ever go for something like that.  Unfortunately I could only swing it if 
it were in Vancouver or Seattle.  A 3 hour drive once a week for 5 weeks I could 
handle.  Or maybe I should just take a 5 week vacation ;-)
