&gt; I found the problem. While we had the axle stubs (the pieces going
&gt; through the drum and which have the 46MM nut on them) my wife cleaned
&gt; them for me. She did such a wonderful job that they were absolutely
&gt; clean when we put them back in...

&gt; Anybody else ever had that problem?

I wouldn't call having a wife willing to clean parts a &quot;problem&quot;  :)
