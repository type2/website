Subject: also running hot - advice?

Hello...

So, with all of this running hot and oil cooler talk of late, I have to say, 
on every one of my long trips so far, my bus runs way hot. I have the gene 
berg oil temp thingy, and if I try and go over 60 for any period of time, it 
starts flickering. Now, this is going up and over hills mind you, but its 
all the time, and in weather that isn't even all that hot. I can take it 
down to around 50-55 for a little bit and it will stop, but the motor is 
much stronger and feels like it should be able to tackle 60-65 with no 
problem.

I just don't understand if this is normal, since VW never included an oil 
temp gauge then wouldn't everyone just using them for normal day to day 
vacationing be possibly running them way too hot without ever knowing it?

Before I installed the temp gauge warning system everything seemed fine, and 
now I constantly worry about ruining the motor. I don't want to push my bus 
any harder, but part of me thinks this can't be right.

The motor is a type 4, 2l with hydro lifters. It only has 50,000 actual 
miles on it, not rebuilt and not removed from the bus since it's original 
installation.

Either, I need to just learn to drive slower, or somethings wrong, or there 
is something I can do to help a somewhat inefficiant system.

If its A, fine, I can deal with that, once I realize thats my only problem.

If it is B, I guess maybe the thermostat that open and closes the flaps? 
Maybe mine isn't cooling itself properly, if that makes any sense.

If it is C, I better get cracking soon. An oil cooler for my motor is around 
200 bones, plus getting someone to install it for me.

Im getting married in 22 days now, and have WAY too many things to try and 
tackle a learning experience right now. That plus we are going to be taking 
the bus on our honeymoon from San Francisco up to Montana, through Canada, 
and back down the coast. 3.5 weeks I will be driving Jasper and I would like 
to do anything I can to keep him chugging along happy.

Any thoughts, suggestions, or tomfoolery is always welcome...
