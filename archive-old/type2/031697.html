&gt; Hi, I recently bought a 74 Riviera in Juarez, Mexico. I live in Colorado.
&gt; I have driven the van while I was down there and it &quot;seems&quot; to run fine. I
&gt; have to go down and pick it up soon but i have a dilemma.
&gt; 
&gt; it be much wiser for me to pull it on the 10 hour (probably 15 with the
&gt; bus) journey back to where I live. Or, if I check the oil and drive it
&gt; like a baby back, would that be ok. Thanks ahead for the advice!

I personally would put it on a trailer and tow it back that way...
