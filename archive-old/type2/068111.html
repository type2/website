Subject: Sliding Door Rubber? 

1.The rubber seal along the bottom of the sliding door is disintigrating.
Where is a good place to get a new one? Any particular type, or brand to get? 
Any tips/tricks on changing this? 

2.Looking into the engine compartment from the back, there are two 
approx 2&quot; diameter pipes about 3/4&quot; long coming out of the engine tin, 
aft of the fan, alternator, dipstick. 
The right one has a hose to the air cleaner's &quot;nose&quot;. I assume it is for
warm air during cold weather warmup. 
There is nothing on the left hand one. What is it? Should it connect to
something? Should it be plugged?
