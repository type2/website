Subject: Weird Feeling In the Rear
Message-ID: &lt;37160514Weird Feeling In the Rear*_at_m400gw.wiley_dot_com&gt;

&gt; My problem is quite strange and I am wondering if anyone can help me. 
&gt;About a month ago I put new wheel cylinders adn shoes on the rear of my 70 
&gt;Campmobile. Ever since then I feel this weird like &quot;shimmy&quot; I feels like it 
&gt;is from the rear.

Check the tightness of your Engine carrier Bolts (which hold the engine into 
the bus), the rear support bracket bolts, and the 
cv axle bolts. Don't know if its this but a shimmy at speed is a scary thing.
