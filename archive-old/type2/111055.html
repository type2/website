Subject: Re: [T2] an urgent Cry for help!

well i know some guys that own a repo truck and could come and get you but it would cost big time to come all the way from s.c. to texas and then to Va...

i tell you what it might not be much of and offer but if you can get her as far as s.c. you are more than welcome to keep her at the house her in upsate south carolina till you can come back for it...
i have a decnt size yard so i could easily stick it to the side as long as you came back for it?

whats wrong with it..?
maybe we could fix it here if you can afford to get it this far i would be more than happy to help you get her fixed along with the others in the area i have met...

sorry i would come to get you in texas but i dont think that my bus would pull that bus....

let me know...
also i am on the airs list for south carolina if needed be...

if you can even get it as far as say upper part of georgia i might be able to help you better...

i will be on vacation all next week so let me know a trip to georgia i could do in not to long of a period...

toccoa georgia maybe,...?

like i say though as long as you come back and get it if you can get her to my house in south carolina you can then go t Va regroup and come back with another oppurtunity or maybe even money...
i know the tow guy but not so well that he will drive to texas or va for free...

locally he will coem get me if i am broke down though and i just buy him lunch but thats alot diffrent to..
peace and good 
i check my email throughout the day everyday...
also remember south carolina airs list...
good luck and stay safe...

&gt;Hello all. I'm in urgent need for someone to help me tow my bus back to 
&gt;Virginia. Right now I am in Houston Texas and i can't get my bus back to Virginia. 
&gt;The bus won't make such a long trip  by herself. I can't afford the cost of a 
&gt;transportation service to have my bus shipped back to Virginia and I don't 
&gt;have a truck or trailer so I am in quite a hard place. Im moving back to Virginia 
&gt;on the 27th of this month and I'm franticlly trying to find a way to get her 
&gt;back home. Can anybody help me out? I can provide cash for gas and some money 
&gt;for your efforts. I can't afford much because I'm a very broke college student 
&gt;but i can probably afford between $300-$400. Thank you very much for any 
&gt;help! Fare thee well-Evan
