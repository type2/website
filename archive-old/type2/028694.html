My 68 bus has an annoying habit of stalling after about 30min of driving
(although it has happened right away). It stalls and then won't start for
about 5min. Sometimes it doesn't completely stall it just loses power for a
few seconds and kicks back in.I've tried two different dizzy's 1 vaccum and
1 009. Tried two different carbs. It started happening after I replaced my
carb, fuel pump and fuel filters/ hoses and my points all in one day.
Sometimes I can see bubbles in the fuel line where it goes into the filter,
what are those from? This is a most annoying problem because I can't
recreate it on demand, although it happens practically every time I take my
car out. ARRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRGGGGGGGGGHHHHHHHHHHHH Help someone please!!
