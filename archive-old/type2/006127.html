I was able to bust both my rear transmission mounts by jacking the motor too
high during a motor removal.  These mounts (prt# 211 599 431) were hard for
me to find.  I wasn't familiar with how the mounts were implemented and
didn't realize that I could break them.  Of course it took me nearly a half
dozen motor removals to do so (I've had a few problems).  I believe these
mounts are used on busses from 1971 to watercooleds.  So be careful not to
raise the motor too high.  And have fun.
