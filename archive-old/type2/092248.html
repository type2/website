Subject: Re:Gas Tank prefilter

&gt; The gas tank (at least from the late 60's to 71 if not later) have a pipe that sticks up into them about 1 inch with a screen on them. This is like a prefilter.

So that was the screen I heard rolling across the bottom of the tank
when I blew air up the line (gas drained) to see if it was clear?  It's
been running fine since I did that.  Doesn't the pipe help guard against
a large piece of crud from sliding over/into the opening and blocking
the flow to the external filter?
