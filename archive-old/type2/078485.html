&gt;Hi all
&gt;I'm trying to add a CD/Radio unit into my 79 Westy and
&gt;it seems that the cutout is a tad too small for a
&gt;standard unit to slip into. Anyone out there have any
&gt;thoughts on a solution (without cutting) that has
&gt;worked ...
======================&gt;
If you really love your bus, and you plan to keep it for a while longer 
than just a bit, I would suggest you find another radio.
Now then, don't take that as a personal affront, but I mean this suggestion 
with the best of faith in it's offering.
Technology will change, and your enlarged cutout in the dash will be there 
long after the technology has passed the CD on by.

My suggestion, and others might attest to the good sounds and seen the 
benefits of what I did, is doing similar to what I did when I had to decide 
on what radio to install.

I bought a radio with an audio input jack that will allow me to plug in a 
portable Cd player, DVD player, MP3 player, whatever, as the technology for 
righteous tunes changes. ............. Best of all, the radio fir into the 
VW sized cutout with out my having to sully the dash.

Speakers ............... Same philosophy ........... Please, no holes !!

Some pictures of my various no-holes installation practices and results can 
be seen on my web page where I have filed pictures on Casper and NewBus.

Buses do not deserve to be cut on until it is necessary to remove rust cancer.
