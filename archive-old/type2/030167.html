&gt; I had to take some pics today. There is oil everwhere. How can it get from
&gt; the cooler to the tin abve all four jugs? How does it get inside AND outside
&gt; the fan housing? I am stumped. Look at the carb.

&gt; 
&gt; Any input?

Have you checked the torque of the case bolts?  You might be squirting oil
mist out of the top seam of the case.  I had one like that and it looked
similar to your pictures.
