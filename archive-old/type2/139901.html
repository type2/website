&gt; &gt; just don't take US 550 from Durango to Ouray(sp) 5hrs in second...!!!

yeah was in my 65 Westy, didn't know better and I am sure overheated it.,
never ran right after that

&gt; On a &quot;schadenfreud&quot; basis, the climb out of the the Columbia River gorge
&gt; on I-90 has always been fun.  Yes, you are in 3rd all the way, but all

one of my favorites is US 50 West of Winchester VA. beautiful scenery and
some stiff grades but not a whole lot of traffic and it is all going the
same speed as you are.
