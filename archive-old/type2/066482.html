Subject: little orange seat

        M. Le Pesant,
        Bon jour. My French skill are pityable, but the guess that 
Sarah posted, &quot;Little Orange Seat That Goes Between The Front Seats&quot; 
sounds about right. &quot;Jump Seat&quot; is sometimes used to describe less-formal
seats, usually the kind that fold up to the wall or bulkhead, but
what you're describing doesn't fold up, does it? 
        Can this orange seat be turned around to face into the
back as well as into the front of the Westie? 

        With Best Regards,

        Bill Abbott
