Subject: International drive your VW to work day DISASTER
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

Hi Volks,

Normally I use my 17 year old Vanagon to drive to work. This morning I got
the email about the
International Drive Your VW To  Work day. Great idea, I printed out the
colour poster put it behind the window of my '78 bay window bus and decided
to use this one today.

Well, I got to about 300 yards from my work place which is about 20 miles
from home. Then suddenly the bus started to make a hell of a knocking noise.
As I was in the middle of an intersection I slowly crawled into the parking
lot where it is still sitting when you read this. Took a (city-) bus and
train to get home. I will tow it back later.

Anyone got any idea what it could be? The engine will still start and run
but makes a loud knocking noise. Broken valve ?

Pmail me if you have a suggestion (I'm in digest mode right now).

Happy driving.
