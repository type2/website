Subject: smoke in tin?


When i run my engine (1800cc dual carbs 74 bus) for a few minutes, then
stop it smoke comes out of the fan... from inside the tin. Does this mean
that there is an oil leak in there (i.e. oil cooler) and the oil is
burning on a hot surface?.... the longer i run the engine the more smoke
when i turn it off....if i run it for 5 minutes its pretty bad. its a
whiteish smoke. 

My only doubt is that I can't imagine it being oil burning that quick. can
the engine get that hot that fast?

 Oil pressure light is not coming on, is working correctly.


either way i forsee removing the alternator, fan, tin, and shroud to get
in there and see whats going on.


thanks everyone

Eddie Goodwin
