Subject: 82 Vanagon - Heater control flap housing

I was under the vanagon bleeding the clutch tonight and noticed that the
Heater control flap housing has a short duct that points to the rear (directly
at the front of the valve covers). This is the exit for the heated air when
the heater flaps are closed. Shouldn't there be an extension on this duct
taking the hot air farther to the rear? It seems that the existing setup would
contribute to heating the oil in the valve cover. Any ideas or suggestions to
correct this?
