Subject: Re: [T2] gas heater

I have no idea what to ask for it.  I just wanted to donate it.  It did have
a leak at where the gasline went into the heater unit.

&gt;
&gt;
&gt; I pulled a gas heater (BN4 I think) out of my 71 westy and would like to
&gt; raffle/donate it to the list.  Proceeds could either go to the list or
&gt; to the Kristie Laurite fund.  I think it has all the parts, duct work
&gt; and I would ship it to who ever wants it or send it to one of the
&gt; gatherings for a raffle.  This was a factory installed unit and has the
&gt; fire wall cut out with it.  Anyone interested Steve 71 westy Sunrise
