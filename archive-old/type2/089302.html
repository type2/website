Subject: Re: [T2] 15w40

I was going to stay away, far away, from this thread but......
Go here and read the section on 'viscosity index improvers' and then remember
all the posts that ask &quot; is 230 to 250 too hot??&quot;
http://www.vtr_dot_org/maintain/lubricants-redline.html
Think it is all BS? Here is another site with info on it, but not as
informative as the 1st one:
http://www.eskimo_dot_com/~dalus/bmw/all/misc/all_oilfaq.html
Multi-grade dino oil has not changed over the years. Only the additive
packages. That is the only difference and so-called improvement. I have
repeatedly written to Castrol and asked them how they got past the 210 degree
polymer breakdown and how they substantiated their advertising slogan
&quot;Engineered for greater protection against thermal breakdown&quot; on every bottle
of oil. That has been going on for over 5 years now. They refuse to answer any
questions!! BUT they have changed the BS slogan on the front now. They now
say: &quot;Engineered For Greater Protection Against Breakdown&quot;. Hmmm, I wonder why
they stopped using the word &quot;Thermal&quot;???  But, alas, it still includes
'thermal' on the back.
But just like tires, you guys are gonna use whatever you want.

&gt; &gt; I hope there is no danger starting up the oil thread.
&gt;
&gt; Richard, it's a holy war, I tell you... Louis vs. Sulimein all over again!
&gt; Crusade vs. jihad! :-)
&gt;
&gt; &gt; The Bentley shows similar temperature ranges for 20w50 and 15w40.  What's
&gt; &gt; the advantage of using 20w50?
&gt;
&gt; The numbers on a can of oil read as follows:  the first number, usually
&gt; followed by a W is the viscosity at room temp (70 degrees fahrenheit)  the
&gt; W means &quot;winter&quot; and says it will still pour at freezing temps.  The
&gt; third number is the viscosity at ~250 degrees fahrenheit.  If there is no
&gt; third number, then the first number is also the viscosity at 250.
&gt;
&gt; Thus a 20W-50 oil protects like a  20 weight oil at room temperature and
&gt; like a 50 weight oil at 250 degrees,  a 15W-40 oil protects like a 15
&gt; weight oil at room temperature and like a 40 weight oil at 250 degrees. An
&gt; sae30W oil protects like 30 weight at room temperature and like a 30
&gt; weight oil at 250 degrees.  An sae30 oil does the same, but may not pour
&gt; at freezing temps.  I believe it is *possible* to find an SAE30 oil but it
&gt; is a challenge :-)
&gt;
&gt; &gt; Also, I asked someone about a single grade oil like 30 and 40 but they
said
&gt; &gt; it has a hard time circulating.
&gt;
&gt; IMHO, this is pure bull.
&gt;
&gt; &gt; What's good for our TypeIV engines?
&gt;
&gt; Well, yes...  err... I dunno :-)  My religious belief is that I used to
&gt; run 20W-50 year round.  We had an oil thread last fall, tho that changed
&gt; my mind.  Karl, who I respect greatly, opined that at 250, the multigrade
&gt; oils may protect like the second number for a bit, but that the multi-vis
&gt; additives broke down quickly and you were left with straight weight oil of
&gt; the loser viscosity index.  This did match my experience, so this spring I
&gt; changed to straight weight SAE50W and in the fall I will change it to
&gt; SAE30W.  This is new to me, but so far it is working out.  We are just
&gt; starting into the 90/90 (90 degrees, 90% humidity) days here, so the
&gt; experiment is still running.
