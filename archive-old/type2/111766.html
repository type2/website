Subject: Wood interior

HHmm that would be my bus.. very nice compliments
thanks! It's comfortable and I should update the
pictures with the Z-bed installed.
I did reply off list about the interior
to Ben. I'm happy to give details on how DAS bus's
interior progressed. Next project Wood headliner.
Best thing to do is take your time. ;-)
