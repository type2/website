Subject: since it's friday...

Well, I thought I'd share my good luck.  Three or four years ago, back when gas was relatively cheap, I was working on cruise ships and decided I didn't need my Honda Goldwing anymore.  A good friend of mine had been begging me to sell it to him so I did.  (Glad I didn't choose to ditch the bus.)  Ever since gas has gone up and I've been stuck here in Chattanooga, I've been trying to get him to sell it back to me.  Well, I finally caught him in a moment of financial embarrassment  and he sold it to me.  WHHOOOPPPPEEEEE!   Same price and he did a bunch of upgrades to it.  Now I have an excuse to get a trailer and a Jamie Rivers hitch set-up and hit the road.  Well, If I could only get out of Chattanooga.  :)  Have a great weekend!  KR
