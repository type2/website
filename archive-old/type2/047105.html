Subject: Re: [T2] '71 wheels same as '72-'78 Wheels?

&gt;For all practical purposes, '71 through '90 steel wheels are
&gt;the same.  There are minor differences in what the central
&gt;hole looks like, but they're invisible with the hubcap on.

Though this statement is true in a retrofit sense I'll chime in it
is NOT true in a forwardfit sense.  The '71-'73 or so vintage wheels
are welded entirely around the periphery of the center portion to
the rim.  '75-'78 are welded less, '79-'85 or so even less, and
by the late 80's just small beads.  Now I'm sure any are sufficiently
made but the problem can occur when your newly blasted and
painted set you've been running on your '71 DON'T fit on the '87
without grinding the fully welded weld bead down most of the
way around the wheel.  GRRR.  Only a problem using early
wheels on a late Vanagon with big brakes which should technically
not be a problem for anyone on this list, but I figured I mention
it.  I think the center hole stabilizes in appearance by about '75
or so BTW, the very early wheels are a bit rounder in contour
in there, and are before they started carrying the standardized
DOT, 5J x 14 (or whatever), and year code markings.  The early
ones just have a big VW stamped like split wheels and maybe
a year code.
