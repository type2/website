&gt; &gt;My philosophy on getting a new bus is that the best way to go about it is
&gt; &gt;to find the best body that you can.  Look for rust-free, look for
&gt; &gt;straight... I do &gt;*not* look at mechanical condition...


I would second that wholeheartedly.  It is far cheaper to put an engine,
trans, brakes, etc. into a bus, than to do the major body work required by
years of exposure to road salt and hard winters.  A rusty bus with a good
engine/trans is worth no more than the value of the engine/trans.  I have
seen many a bus in junkyards that were mechanically decent but had so much
structural rust that they were way beyond repair.  But rarely the other way
around.

Of course, the standards vary geographically. You guys in
California/Nevada/Arizona junk busses that would fetch $2k just for body
condition alone here on the east coast, and that's no exaggeration.  There,
they end up in junkyards for mechanical reasons, here due to rust-through.
