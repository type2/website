Subject: Gas pedal problems

I have a sticky accelerator. I'm going to replace to cable tomorrow, but while
I was looking around I noticed what was the remnants of a spring on the pedal.
I found a spring at the Bus Depot here:

http://www.busdepot_dot_com/busdepot/details.jsp?partnumber=211721549A

but mine was set up different. Mine went through the hole in the floor and
connected to both ends of the &quot;S&quot; shaped rod that hooks on to the bottom of
the pedal. At least I think that's what happened. All I have is a few coils
wrapped around both ends of this bracket indicating there used to be a spring
there.

So how is this supposed to be? Where does the spring in the above link hook on
to.  Maybe this is a dumb question, but I'm feeling pretty dumb, so if the
shoe fits.

One last thing. I just got a Bentley the other day, so if all of this is in
there and I haven't found it yet, just tell me to clam up and pint me to where
it is in the book

Thanks,

Zach
