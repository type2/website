Subject: [T2] Bird's beak fuel filler neck

I will trade one Bird's beak fuel filler neck (like new) + money

for

2 Westy sage green front doors, and one sliding door.

The Bird's beak fuel filler neck is better quality than the new, open throat 
fuel filler necks for sale now-a-days.  Truly, it appears as NOS (New, Old 
Stock).

I will pay fair market value PLUS shipping for these three doors, but they 
MUST be near perfect; no dings/dinges/RUST.

California people, take note. This is the fuel filler neck which you are 
looking for!!!

I just came across this on Saturday, and I will not sell the Bird's beak 
fuel filler neck outright.

And if you see this model, you will KNOW that it is NOT easy to replicate, 
and I would not expect to see them being repro'ed for a long time.  Can't 
just make a model and pour the rubber!!

So, you California busers, give me a break on my search for these primo 
doors, and I will give you a break on a choice California needed item.
