Subject: oil cooler

Because I live in one of the highest elevations in Arizona, everywhere I go is
down hill. Getting most places is a breeze in either of my busses, but getting
back home is either a loooong gradual up hill or a short steep up hill, or
both. I am considering installing an auxiliary oil cooler before next summer
to help keep my engine happy when I'm climbing out of the deserts south of
here.

Is there anyone out there who has added an oil cooler to a 2L engine who has
pictures of how they installed it?
What's the best way to tap into the oil gallery to get the oil to the cooler.
I can't seem to find any pictures of an adapter that takes the place of the
oil filter mount. Can I still use the good Mann or Mahle oil filters on these
remote filter mounts or am I stuck with using an exploding fram filter?
