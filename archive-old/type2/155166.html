Subject: Re: [T2] Coil Autopsy

Sounds about right for the construction of an ignition coil.  

They use so little space for the windings because of the high voltages
involved.  Tracking could become an issue, so they play it *real* safe
with the voltages involved when it comes to insulation.  You'll probably
find that the high tension lead is connected to the steel core. Check
the spacers (either phenolic, plastic, or paper) that hold the core off
the bottom of the can.  They may have tracks on them.  

Don't worry about the oil, it's non PCB mineral oil.  Icky, and clings
to damn everything, but harmless. (don't drink it, tho)  If you unwind
it, you'll probably find the primary on the outside, most likely 20-ish
gauge wire, and the secondary on the inside (38-40ga, IIRC).  Ignition
coil is an induction coil, and relies on the collapsing magnetic field
of the primary to create the high voltage spark on the secondary side.
(taken care of by points or computer).  

You may never even see the tracking if you unwind the coil. It could
have been tracking across the bottom of the cap, or almost anywhere
(that burn mark you saw?  Could be it.)  

Messy, but neat, eh?

&gt; The coil was purchased just a couple months ago at Autozone in California

&gt; Father's Day this year I started feeling an occasional misfire that

&gt; Swapping in the old original Bosch coil got things back where they should
