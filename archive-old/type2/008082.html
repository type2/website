Subject: Gas Tank...again
To: type2_at_type2_dot_com


Hey, All my leads on a gas tank have fallen through. Even though, in this months Hot VW, California Imports advertise one for 199.99, I called and they did'nt have any and did'nt know where to get any. I've emailed several places and come up empty. Does anyone know a phone number, email address, homepage, etc.. where I can find
a new gas tank for a 1976 Westy? Please email me if you do.

Thanks,

Greg
76 Westy
