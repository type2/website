Subject: have to double pump my clutch

my clutch was working fine, then I went from boulder
to summit county.  coming over the eisenhauer tunnel i
noticed it was hard to get into gear.  finally i
realized i now needed to doulbe pump my clutch to get
enough pressure to depress the clutch.  could this be
an altitude thing or a cold thing or is one of my
slave cylinders on its way out. if so, can i replace a
part of the cylinder or do i need a whole new unit?

thanks
