Subject: Re: [T2]tire broke inward this morning on me

Fact,

A professional mechanic has a duty to do professional work.  Sometimes
it means refusing to do a job.  There is no excuse for something like
welding a ball joint in place.  As we see here, it was done, it got the
car home, and it broke.  It was not safe.  A cab or bus ride home would
have been.  The mechanic with the welder was flat out wrong to do it.

BTW, I am an ASE certified tech...

 &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;This just burns me to no end. Another case of a &quot;Brand X&quot;, &quot;Half Ass&quot;
 &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;repair shop giving the industry and Technicians in general a bad name!
 &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;  This is why some states are making noises about Licensing 
Technicians.
 &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Watch what happen to the labor rate when that happens. Not sure how 
I would
 &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;vote on this one. I don't want Big Brothers nose in my shop, but if 
this
 &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;kind of thing continues to happen, he will be there.
 &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;  There are some jobs you make money on by &quot;not&quot; doing them. This 
is one,
 &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;repaired in this way.
 &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;  You should never have to weld a ball joint in. Its a sure sign of
 &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;something being wrong. They knew that. So the fact they did it, in 
the way
 &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;they did, makes them very dangerous.
 &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;  Enough Soap Box for today. Please all, remember to use a little 
common
 &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;sense when doing, or having your car worked on. Especially on 
safety related
 &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;systems, steering, brakes, fuel systems, lighting, etc. Don't try to
 &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;outsmart the engineers who designed it, fix it right the first 
time! Quality
 &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;repair work is not expensive, its priceless!

 &gt;&gt; Hey Howard    Man this is what burns me.  Somebody jumping on their 
soapbox
 &gt;&gt; and mouthing off without any facts.    Fact  he was 5 hours from 
home,  fact he
 &gt;&gt; was shown the problem, fact he had no more money, fact there wasn't 
another
 &gt;&gt; torsion arm around.  fact he had to get home.   fact  the choice was 
his to
 &gt;&gt; make and he knew what could happen. he made the choice. He choose to 
weld it in
 &gt;&gt; place and take his chances.   But what you are saying is that you 
wouldn't have
 &gt;&gt; done anything but push the bus out the door till he could get 
another arm and
 &gt;&gt; some how more money.   sounds like you need to keep taking lefts 
till you do
 &gt;&gt; get a right   later  mark
