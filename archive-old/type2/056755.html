Subject: electrics

hi all
I own a 72 RHD crossover model camper and I'm having problems with the
electrics. can anyone help me with where I can get full wiring diagrams
with routing of cables and cable colours on it? Any diagrams will help
except, of course, those from the Haynes joke book. I also need as much
information as possible on the diagnostics wiring and connector pin-
outs.
Thanks for your help 
Andy
