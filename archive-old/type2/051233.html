Volks,

Mr. Baldwin is by and large correct, but the additives *raise* the octane
rating (which is tested and published in any case), so moving up an octane
grade is not necessary.  They lower specific heat content, as alcohols and
ethers contain less BTU's per pound, which will raise your fuel
consumption (my gas milage drops 2-3 mpg here in winter when the
oxygenated fuels come out :-(

&gt; Environmentalists don't like the additives because they result in some
&gt; significant side effects, e.g. water pollution, why california is
&gt; looking to ban some of them, apparently people don't like drinking
&gt; water that tastes and smells like grain alcohol and causes cancer, go
&gt; figure ;-)

Very true of MBTE, which is horribly poisonous and carcinogenic; partially
true of methanol, which is merely poisonous; up to you on ethanol (grain
alcohol :-). The really bad thing about both alcohols and ethers is that
they are excellent solvents.  In some cases, they can dissolve your fuel
system (older carb floats and some fuel lines were made of an ether/
alcohol-soluble plastics) and can remove deposits around your rings and
valves that were holding your engine together :-)  In any FI vehicle, you
should have no problem other than lousy gas milage.  In your T1-powered
bus, replace the gas lines, rebuild the carb and hope the rings hold
together.
