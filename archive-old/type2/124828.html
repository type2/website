Subject: Re: [T2] Can't get lug nuts off!

&gt; I reccomend using a socket with a breaker bar. Once you have the socket
&gt; on the lug and a good amount of force on the breaker bar, hit the
&gt; breaker bar where it connects to the socket with a sledge hamner.

And if you go this route, might I suggest buying all Craftman tools and
sockets, and doing it in the Sears parking lot? That way if they break, your
already their to call 'em on their lifetime warrenty. :) Lol

Cheers
Chris
