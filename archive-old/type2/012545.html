Hi Pat,

I'm in the process of having my 80 Westy engine
rebuilt.  I'm going to have the mechanic try for 135
psi compression, because otherwise they don't have
enough power.  Some mechanics like to rebuild for
lower compression to get more life out of the engine,
but our &quot;bricks&quot; (80 and newer vanagons) need all the
power help they can get.  I believe if you had the
proper compression, you would be getting in the low
20s on mostly flat terrain when driving close to 55
mph.  I used to be able to get 21 to 23 mpg on trips
to the beach.

Rob
