Subject: Re: [T2] Motor Changes For the Bus


&gt;Boy are you off the mark. The 912/356 motors are nothing like either the 
&gt;Beattle or T-IV motors, other than being horizontally opposed and air 
&gt;cooled. By 1955, the Porsche motor used but a few bits of hardware that 
&gt;was the same as VW. Everything of consequence is different. The later 
&gt;iterations put out 50% more horsepower in stock trim than any VW T-IV. The 
&gt;biggest obstacle with fitting these motors in a T-II has to do with the 
&gt;custom tinwork needed to seal the motor compartment along with custom 
&gt;engine/tranny mounts and adapting bigger CV's/axles for the extra torque. 
&gt;Then you will really have some fun swapping gears to get the torque band 
&gt;to work well pushing twice as much weight. The Porsche motor has a much 
&gt;longer stroke and wider power band, but to find a good harmony of gears 
&gt;for the Porshce engine and tranny to work well with the Bus load will add 
&gt;to the cost in time/money for the experiment.

Didn't mean to say that anything was interchangeable like some Rolex watch 
versus a fake Rolex - just that at some point long ago the designs - 
Porsche and VW four bangers - were similar and then the engineers took the 
Porsche version to the moon while the VW version continued to putter along 
as the same old design with minor improvements.

I t'ain't rich so I'll stick with my junkyard queen - the Corvair.
