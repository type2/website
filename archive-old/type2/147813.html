I saw a '70 or '71 Riviera camper at the Woodburn show last month with a T4 
engine installed.  They used the T4 moustache bar hung off the framerails with 
custom brackets near the bumper mounts.  Not sure if the stock mounting points 
were removed or if it had stock T4 cooling or an upright conversion .. didn't look 
all that closely.
