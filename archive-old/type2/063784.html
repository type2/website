&gt;Also The '76 panels were actual wood on the face, whereas the 
&gt;replacements were a plastic contact paper with a wood grain print. 

You can tell a pre'78 from a post-78 right away just from looking 
at the condition of the side paneling and wood trim.  The older 
ones with the veneer look like crap - the veneer wears off and 
discolors.  The vinyl, surprisingly, holds up much better. When I 
found a '79 in a junkyard once, I transplanted all of the panels 
into my '77 just for this reason.
