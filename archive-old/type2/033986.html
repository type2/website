Subject: The Great bus relay update

On Monday of this week Marv Krupps roared down my street as Wayne and I were
getting ready to load the '69 on a trailer for its journey to Virginia. It
was quite a site seeing Marv pull in the driveway in his supercool bonestock
1971 single cab. The hupcap changed hands while Wayne snapped some pics with
the throwaway camera that accompanies the hubcap.

Marv was nice enough to help us get the bus on the trailer and follow us
around to find a notary public. After bus selling was completed Marv and I
sat down for some lunch and a fine chat about buses, busing and buses. We
also talked about buses:) For those of you who have not met Marv, he is a
super nice person and a great lover of air cooled VWs. He and Lucy, his wife
of many years, own 7 aircooled VWs and nothing else! 

The next stop for the huncap will be Hillsborough, NC and the fine
countrybusfreakestate of Matt Freeman. From there we will hopefully travel
on to Chapel Hill, NC to meet Dallas and have another cerimonial meal and
hupcap exchange.
