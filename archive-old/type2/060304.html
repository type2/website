Subject: RE: vw theft prevention

I went the cheapo route.

I made a sign that I lay on my dash board. It says  &quot;PLEASE DON'T SIT ON
THE BABY SNAKE . . . . IT REALLY PISSES OFF HIS MOMMY!!!&quot;

Something like the guy who was was walking down the street, every few
minutes raising his hands and snapping his fingers.  His fellow traveler
asked him what he was donig.  He said  &quot;It keeps the ELEPHANTS away.&quot; 
His felow traveler said, &quot;But there aren't any elephants within 3,000
miles!!!.  Answer: &quot;See, it WORKS ! ! ! &quot;

(Don't ask me what this all means.  I am STILL trying to figure out the
'42' thing.)
