Subject: Engine install update

Still haven't connected the batery on my 80 Vanagon to crank it over yet.
Quite frustrated with myself! I decided to prelube the engine before I turned
it over for the initial compression test. Even though the rebuilder had run
the engine on their machine I decided that becouse the oil cooler had no oil
in it I should refill the oil galeries and cooler before cranking it with the
starter. Using the largest syrenge I could get at the local feed store, I
pushed oil into the oil pressure sender hole via the extension hose for the
O.P. guage sensor. On the 3rd syrenge full my heart sank! Drip DRIP Drip, goes
the oil from the filter. On investagation I think one of my cooler seals (top
one probably) is leaking! (&amp;*#E$%&amp;!!!)(_at_#$^&amp;*). I should have done the prelube
before I put all the sheet metal on and installed the engine. AAARG. I'm just
glad I didn't crank over the engine with this leak. Could have been a
catastrophy.

I know I've heard that the engine has to come out to change the cooler but is
it possible to change the seals with the engine in the bus?
