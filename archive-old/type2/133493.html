&gt; Thanks for the help so far. I finally bit the bullet and purchased a 70
&gt; bus and now I have a few questions. I am in Savannah, Ga and am going
&gt; up to Trenton New Jersey to pick up this bus. I am going to be driving
&gt; it back approx 750 mile trip. It's in driveable condition, but I would

take route 301 from Delaware to Virgina bypass lots of the traffic on I-95
and nicer route and places to pull off and rest let the engine cool off
and there are some AIRS folks along the way.  be sure and take the list

&gt; like to take some precautions do you have any suggestions? Also I would
&gt; like to get the oil changed before I start the trip, is this something
&gt; I have to go to a specialist for or can just about anyone do it? Can

nah any one can do it, just don't pull the drain bolt too tight when
putting it back on

&gt; anyone recommend a good mechanic who can take a look at the bus in
&gt; Trenton or near there to either give it a once over and oil change?

sorry can't help you there
&gt;
&gt; Thanks for your help, I'm sure I'm going to have a ton more questions.

take a Bentley manual and some basic tools, and maybe a few minor spare
parts like a set of points.  make sure you cell phone is charged and your
triple A is paid up.  carry some food and water too., (for you not the
bus)

have a safe trip
Bob
