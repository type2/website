Ken et al

Checked in with local VW guru and he had two suggestions.
1) you cannot afford to pay me to fix this :)&gt;
2) With the T4 engine it would be easier to pull the axels and drop the
tranny to access the clutch and its associated components. 

I have neither pulled the engine or dropped the tranny before. Davd Schwarze
whose opinion I value suggests pulling the two together. I have one floor
jack to work with so I wonder whether this is feasible?. Opinions are
welcome

How far is too far to drive for free beer? What if  pizza is offered with
beer? :)&gt;
