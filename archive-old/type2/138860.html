&gt; Has anyone seen an oil drain plug that had an allen wrench hole in it?

Yep. Some of the engine seems to have them and some don't. Mine is original:

I don't know why people have such trouble with this plug. Even the one I
found at the junkyard today looked like someone had tried to remove it with
a chisel.

&gt; Any
&gt; thoughts how to get my out so that I can put in a &quot;proper&quot; plug in so that
&gt; during future oil changes I can get it out with an opened-ended or box-ended
&gt; wrench?

The correct tool for the job is an 8mm hex bit on the end of your ratchet.
Works everytime.
