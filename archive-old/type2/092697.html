Subject: Re:engine stand-using engine lifter??

The catalogs sell a lifting harness/bar with a threaded shaft. You hook 
this bar to the engine with chains and then hook it to the lift.

Once the engine is in the air - you simply adjust the thread shaft on the 
lifting harness and that will allow the engine to hang at any angle you 
want it to.

It would not be hard to make one with a good look at a picture in a 
catalog. Just need some metal stock and a welding machine.

&gt;A neighbor gave me one of those hydraulic engine lifters with the big
&gt;arm that lifts up as it is pumped- anyone make a base for this that
&gt;allows the engine to be slid onto it and then lifted?  Problem I see is
&gt;that attaching 4 chains to a base must have some neans to keep them
&gt;vertical and not angled towards the lift hook?
