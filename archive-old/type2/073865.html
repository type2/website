Subject: Re: [T2] 2.0 FI Again

oh yeah, I forgot.. my engine would not start at all because I forgot to
hook up that sensor!

It's located just in front (towards the front of the car) of the intake
manifold.  The wire from the sensor should then go into a little
connector which then goes into the wiring harness along with the two
injector cables.

Look to see if you have a hole where the sensor should go.  The hole is
just under a centimeter in diameter.  If you don't have the sensor, go
grab yourself one!

&gt; &gt;From what I have now heard, I started to look for the
&gt; cly head temp #3 (Temp sensor 2 I assume), but I could
&gt; not find it where the manual states....between the
&gt; intake flange and the spark plug hole of cylinder #3.
&gt; I did however find the wire that I assume should
&gt; connect to it.  I can't for the life of my figure out
&gt; where to hook it up.  The only thing I see that could
&gt; be this sensor is just on the firewall side of the
&gt; distributor, and it is already hooked up (could be
&gt; wrong)
&gt; 
&gt; Off on a limb, the PO said that he had a cylinder head
&gt; rebuilt, and when looking throught the #3 spark plug
&gt; hole, I see a very clean cylinder head so I assume
&gt; that's the one.  My question is, when the work was
&gt; done, could they have put different engine tin in and
&gt; forgotten to hook up the sensor?  Just grabbing at
&gt; straws.
