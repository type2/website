Subject: Re: [T2] Dipstick Test, Fanshroud, and Engine Temps

&gt; Crawled all over the archives looking for the definitive procedure for
&gt; performing the &quot;dipstick test&quot; to try and get a &quot;feel&quot; for if and how hot my
&gt; bus is running.
&gt;
&gt; The fan shroud was warm.  Not uncomfortably warm but pretty warm.  I would
&gt; say hot shower warm.
&gt;
&gt; Grabbing the dipstick where it enters the block was about the same.  Pulling
&gt; the dipstick out and touching the &quot;wet&quot; end was too hot to hold onto.

not supposed to touch the &quot;Wet&quot; end. the handle is fine.

&gt; Now a fellow airhead here at work says the fanshroud should be &quot;cool&quot; to the
&gt; touch (personally I don't see how it could be colder than the ambient air at
&gt; best but he seemed to think that it was supposed to be that way)

older &quot;type I&quot; style engines did stay cool(er) because the fan wasn't
right on the engine and it was thin tin.  the &quot;type IV&quot; engine fan is
right on the end of the engine and above the muffler it gets considerably
warmer, not hot but a lot warmer than the older style fan.

&gt; I am new to aircooled engines and given that my bus has &quot;almost&quot; left me
&gt; stranded a few times already I am a little nervous about it.  I hate that
&gt; feeling of &quot;am I going to make it?&quot;

the excitement, of the trip, as you get to know your bus you will &quot;bond&quot;
with it and know what is normal and what needs to be checed,

remember the old &quot;$5,000&quot; rule.   when buying a bus it will cost you
$5,000 to get it reliable either up front or in repairs.

enjoy the ride
Bob
