Subject: NOT an oil thread, just a question!!! Walmart oil at 92 cents Canadian!!

So Wallymart has their oil on the shelf at 92 cents Canadian which is about
60 cents US. That is an incredible price. It is 10-30 and appears to be
similarly bottled as the Esso they sell. Comments on this? At 3000km
oilchanges, would this oil suffice? I don't know about it's additive package
and of course Wallymart people know nothing. Wonder who is making it for
them, it carries all the approval ratings, but IS marked energy conserving
which I've been told is not a good thing for air cooleds.
