&gt;I am thinking of building a custom cabinet to house my DVD player and TV which
&gt;will reside behind the front drivers seat so I can watch from bed. The DVD is
&gt;already set up for 12V but the TV I'm looking at is a standard 13&quot; using 
&gt;regular
&gt;110V plug. ( I work for a DVD/TV manufacturer so I have access to  these 
&gt;items). I
&gt;have heard of a power inverter but I'm not sure if this is the route I 
&gt;should go
&gt;or if I should get a video source already made for automotive applications 
&gt;even
&gt;though the screen size is so much smaller.  Any thoughts? I realize I will 
&gt;need an
&gt;extra battery but I am getting conflicting opinions from the guys at work on
&gt;wether to get a standard battery or a marine battery.

Neither of those options is ideal, but the marine battery (which may be 
labeled &quot;Deep Cycle&quot;) is a better choice than a standard starting 
battery.  As for the TV, I'd ditch it and get an LCD panel.  The prices 
have come way down and they are smaller, lighter and consume less power 
than a tube-style TV (all good things for a VW camper application).  You 
should be able to find a 12V one for less than $150.  If you must use a 
tube TV, try to get one that runs off of 12V as using an inverter to power 
a 13&quot; 110v TV is very inefficient.
