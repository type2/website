Subject: Re: [T2] Bus won't run i need help


What do you mean when you say you have no spark? Do you have spark from the
coil to the diz? Where does the spark trail end?

We had a case up the block here where there was a nice spark from the coil
to the diz but none at the plugs. New wires didn't help and a new cap/rotor
didn't either. This was a &quot;known good&quot; coil. The symptom went away once we
substituted another coil. The bad coil had been running fine when the bus
was parked...

&gt;OK just put a new motor it went in while. Everything hooked back up. It
&gt;cranks over and everything but it will not start. I have no spark. Before i
&gt;get tons people asking me if i have a good coil, points, condensor and wires.
&gt;I have checked all of them. If i am doing something wrong let me know. I need
&gt;my bus back running by monday since this is my first day of college and i
&gt;need transporation. If anyone wants to give me a hand this weekend and they
&gt;are in the Northern, IL area that would be great. Thanks alot
