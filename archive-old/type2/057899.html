 Hello List,


 For those of you who are following the trials and tribulations of my
attempt to keep my 73 Westy going, I have a happy thing to report!! Last
week I wrote about me thinking that I dropped a valve and was ready to pull
the motor again. While waiting for Gordon Couger to drop by to see if he
was going to buy the 76, I decided that I would look one more time at the
valve adjustments.

 How I messed up, I'll never know, but after pulling the valve cover off, I
saw that the #3 intake valve adjuster was totally backed out !! After
shaking my head at my ingnorance, I proceeded to adjust the valves and
ensure that they were properly locked down. I went ahead and adjusted #1 &amp;
#2 while I was at it, popped the valve covers on and proceeded to take her
for a spin. 

 While driving up the street, I started noticing an odor, so I decided to
turn the Great Pumpkin around and go home. I pulled into my driveway and
then the had a large amount of smoke coming from the engine compartment. I
immediately back it out towards the street, since I didn't want my house to
catch on fire, then went looking for the source of the smoke. 

 Well, as you may have guessed by now, the right valve cover wasn't seated
properly and gave the right heat exchanger a nice oil bath!! So, to add
with the other oil stains from the motor pull a couple of weeks ago, I now
have a trail of oil and another puddle to clean up, maybe my driveway will
qualify for EPA Super Fund clean up!!!

 Well, Gordon bought the 76 bus, I got the valve covers on properly, and
the Great Pumpkin runs great...I hope I don't have any more problem since
I'm driving the bus to NM in two weeks!!!
