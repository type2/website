Subject: '79 westy gas venting question

    Hi everyone,

    Spring is here so I had to re-subscribe to get my '79 westy back in
shape. I was driving it around town and noticed a gas smell in the van.
After checking out the fuel lines, and looking for leaks i traced it to the
gas fume vent line that goes into the charcoal canister. When I removed the
line from the canister the fuel smell went away.

    Does that mean that I have to (1) replace the canister? (2) or that my
lines are on the canister incorrectly? And I am wondering if it is dangerous
to just let the fuel vent into the engine compartment, as it is now doing to
avoid the fuel smell.

    Many many thanks,

    Sheldon
