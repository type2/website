called FRP, (fibreglass Reenforced Panel)

&gt; last week and this idea of sealing the under

&gt; pannel would be an excellent substitute for metal

used em on the underside of my porch roof to keep the pigeons out.  not
sure if they would be strong enough to really do anything on the van if
you hit a rock or something????
