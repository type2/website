&gt;My '72 Campmobile (Sounder) needs a new engine. My local mechanic (Seattle

&gt;the sources for new engines? Which places have the best quality? Prices?

I wouldn't recommend GEX.  If I had to buy one I'd probably go with Mark
Stephens.  You probably won't find one for under $1,000 not including
shipping, which could be considerable.

&gt;Question No. 2: It's a long story, but is an engine from a '73 Westie
&gt;compatible with my '72? And if it is, what's preferable: Keeping my Weber
&gt;carbs, or keeping the newly rebuilt stock dual carbs that are on this '73
&gt;engine.

The 73 engine is almost identical to the 72.  The crosspipe that feeds the
brake booster is on the opposite side of the engine so you will need that
from your 72 plus the front (FIF) engine tin from the '72.  You should
probably use the '72 fan housing too, although the 73 one will fit.  72 has
no bracket for the smog pump.

I think I've made my opinion on the dual Solexes known.  If you have newly
rebuilt stock Solexes, keep them and thank God for being so nice to you.
The 72 has different intake manifolds, throttle linkages, and air cleaner
but the 73 system will work great if it's okay with the smog weenies in
your area.  The taller 73 manifolds should give you a little extra torque
over the shorter 72 version, but I've never seen this confirmed in print.
