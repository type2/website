Subject: fixing things up and misc. ramblings...

Happy Friday, everyone.  Between struggling through a messy set of OS
upgrades and patch installs, I've been doing a bit of thinking about what
to do next with Spike the wonder bus.  Here are some thoughts...

- - First, I've cancelled the insurance and removed the plates for the
winter.  I'm back to driving my trusty Jetta, but I'm trying to decide
whether to keep fixing it or trade it in on a Subaru Impreza wagon.  Not
really bus-related, but any advice from anyone who has owned one would be
appreciated.  Taking the bus off the road gives me some time to hand it
over to a mechanic to do the things I can't do myself and keeps me from
driving it around in the salt.  Too bad, too.  It handles much better in
the snow than the Jetta does.

I've come up with a list of things I need to do to Spike over the next
few months:

- - Patch 2 rust holes (driver side floor and rocker behind sliding door)
- - Replace rear brakes (everything on both sides) &amp; possibly master cyl.
- - Replace *entire* exhaust system incl. both heaters (mucho dinero!)
- - Replace right front wheel cylinder
- - Valve adjustment (my first one)
- - Replace fuel lines (not cracked, but I don't know how old they are)
- - Get the backup lights and horn to work
- - Get a front-mount spare tire thingy
- - Overall tuneup/adjust carbs - tough to start when cold and backfires 
        occasionally, though I think this may be exhaust-related.

I'm basically looking for advice on what I should attempt to do myself and
what I might be better leaving to others.  I've got basic mechanical
knowledge.  I've replaced things like starters, alternators, brake pads,
etc.  I know wiring pretty well, and will probably do the electrical stuff
on my own, but I don't know my way around the inside of an engine and as
much as I hate to say it the quality of my work tends to suffer from my
lack of patience.  

Looking for any thoughts on what you suggest I try...

- - Tom
