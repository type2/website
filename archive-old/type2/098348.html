&gt; aircleaner does not have the thermostatic element any more.  Is there even any
&gt; reason to hook up the preheat hose?

there are several different arrangements.  My '71 has a &quot;J&quot; shaped tube
that begins just aft of the cylinder finning of the #2 cylinder, then
bends up and passes through the rear breast plate tin.  From here, a
flexible hose carries the hot air up to the air cleaner.

I've noticed this tube missing from many VWs, often with a gaping hole in
the tin to let hot air recirculate in the summer.

The hot air is not warmed by the exhaust, but by the cylinder finning.  I
have no idea why this is.

My air cleaner thermostat no longer works either, but I hook up the
preheat hose in winter and remove it in summer, blocking the J-tube with
a plug.  The preheat hose definitely improves drivability and may prevent
carb icing as well.
