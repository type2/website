Subject: Re: [T2] VWTrends rumor- March issue to be printed

I'm with the other guys that like printed material...been doing computers 
since 1976, so have seen things come a long way, but sure do see that a 
lot of things show up in magazines before they show *anywhere* on the net.

Yes, Everett and thesamba would probably like it, but we are talking some 
serious additional bandwidth for him.....

**Anyone have their latest vwtrends handy to show what the circulation 
was?**

Think of 10-20,000 more readers per day on thesamba.  Then Everett would 
have to charge for access.  :-((

It's really hard to curl up on the couch with a nice drink and a 
computer...hard to read a computer in an airport terminal, or at the camp 
site too....hard to fold over pages on a computer so as to remeber why you 
kept that particular issue of the magazine...ohh...yeah, it had that 
newest gizmo that you thought you needed...right there on the page....a 
page that didn't go away because of storage problems on a computer...or a 
dead drive.

Cheers, dave

&gt; It will be the last one unless some Christmas miracle happens to put them 
&gt; back in business


&gt; I wonder what other magazines got the axe ?
