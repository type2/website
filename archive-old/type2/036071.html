Subject: boot ?

Yesterday someone asked me if I had any jumpleads in the boot.
Boot ?   My bus doesn't have a boot !   
Vans in general don't have boots !   (Not even front engined ones !)

But there *is* such a thing as a van with a boot !   (Made by VW of course.)

How cool is that !?   A van - with a boot !

The VW Fridolin !
