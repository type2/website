Subject: Fuel Filter Access

Our lovely 1970 bus died the other day (sort of &quot;stumbled&quot; a couple of times
and then died at a light- had to be towed home), and after some scholastic
research and talking to people who know way better than we do (still a
novice with engines, etc), we've come to believe that there is a good
possibility that the fuel filter and hose needs to be replaced.  My partner
in crime is trying to do that today. I just got a call from him asking
whether the entire engine needs to be removed to access the fuel filter.
This seems unlikely to me, but without the bus or any manuals in hand, I
couldn't say.  Does anyone here know of a better way to access the filter?

Thanks in advance for your help!

Kelly
