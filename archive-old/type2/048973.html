Subject: RE: [T2] hand brake cable length and brake shoe questions

&gt; Bus Depot offers hand brake cables for late 71-79 bus for 9.95
&gt; the length of this is 2966MM
&gt; RMMW offers hand brake cables for 72-79 bus for 12.95 the length
&gt; of this is 2960 MM Which would be correct?  I know they both can't be
right.

Not sure which length is a typo, obviously one of our measurements is off by
6mm.  But it's a moot point because both agree on the part number.  You need
a 211 609 701T, regardless of what the correct length is.

&gt; Also I noticed there is a difference in rear brake shoes during
&gt; the 73 model year (my bus year) at chassis number 213 210 2497.  My bus is
233
&gt; 210 0455.

You must ignore the second digit of the VIN number, as that just denotes
body type (camper, passenger van, cargo van etc.).  Which means that going
by VIN number, you _should_ have the earlier style. Also, my reference lists
a manufacturing month change of 12/72, so you might want to check it that
way as well. As you noted, neither guarantees anything completely as
sometimes VW switched things around, but your odds would be good.

&gt; Just FYI on this part
&gt; Bus Depot 29.95
&gt; RMMW 24.95

Not so.  RMMW generally ships generic brand &quot;white box&quot; remanufactured brake
shoes. For the $5 difference, we ship original-equipment German made Pagid
shoes - and they are brand new, not resurfaced.  Most retailers can't get
you brand new shoes for your bus at any price, let alone German ones for
under $30 - we import them ourselves in order to get you this price. When we
did sell the generic ones that RMMW sells, we sold them for about $17.  I
can safely say that there is virtually NO situation where you will find a
RMMW price lower than ours, comparing apples to apples, because we work at a
MUCH lower profit margin than they do.  In any case where our price looks
higher, it is almost certainly because we are shipping a higher-quality
product (as is the case above, where for $5 more we are shipping a product
that wholesales for $15 more).
