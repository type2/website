Subject: Bellhousing compatability, Vanagon vs. Bay

I would like to use a vanagon bellhousing in my baywindow bus.  
Unfortunately, the vanagon bellhousing is set up for a hydraulic 
clutch (the baywindow is a cable).  It doesn't appear that I can 
switch the arm mechanisms out because the pivot rod in the vanagon 
bellhousing is of a larger diameter.  Has anyone run into this 
before and found a solution?  Did all Vanagons have hydraulic 
clutch actuators?  Has anyone retrofitted the hydraulic clutch 
mechanism to a baywindow?

Thanks,

-David
