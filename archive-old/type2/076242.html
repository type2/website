Subject: Re: [T2] engine cutting out problem

In my experience coils will create a miss under load first then get worse.
I would check that the intake system hasn't developed a vacuum leak due to
loose manifold nuts.
I,ve seen it before.
Also check air cleaner.
Good luck.

Subject: [T2] engine cutting out problem


&gt; Well after getting the bus back on the road and enjoying not having
&gt; heat (soon to be fixed :) ) I small problem has returned. Sometimes
&gt; while on the highway and usually not full throttle but a little below
&gt; the engine misses, not much, just enough to notice. On this 79 2 liter
&gt; w/ FI I have recently replace the dist cap,points,condensor,plugs &amp;
&gt; wires. The only time it seems to do it is when it has just rained or
&gt; it is quite humid. I have looked at most of the engine connections esp
&gt; the temp sensor II and everything seems tight. In the next few days i
&gt; plan on checking connections w/ multi-meter, but not there yet.
&gt;
&gt; So, anyway does these symptoms sound familiar to anyone? Since I
&gt; haven't replaced the coil, I sorta suspect it. Would a coil that is on
&gt; it's last leg become more unreliable when humid? TIA
