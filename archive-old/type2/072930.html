The Mothership is a stock two litre with FI.  She has traveled around
America roughly three different times and I only had one problem with the
FI system.  No it wasn't a connector rattling loose.  It was the AFM and
jack Stafford and I salvaged one from a yard in LA.

The guy that owned her before me said it never let him down once.

You guys that are nay-sayers to fuel injection just don't want to take the
time to learn about it.  I am no expert at anything on my bus but I take
care of the biggest portion of the work myself and have done so with much
success.  I believe the key is to keep the system clean and tuned.

I am convinced that VW built a good system and so far cannot complain at
all.  I don't believe I ever want a carb set up on a pancake simply because
it wasn't originally designed that way.  I am sure VW gave the option but I
will trust FI anyday of the week.

Just my 14 cents worth of change.

Peace,
Charlie Ford
