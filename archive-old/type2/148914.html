Subject: 1978 2.0L FI unit Spark Plug Swap

1978 2.0L FI unit.  Going through the motions of swapping sparkplugs.
Following Muir's book.  Except that one hole/threads looks to be messed up
at the beginning.  I tried other plugs and they get a few turns down by
hand, and then stop.  Tried once with ratchet, but that really did not help.
 
Do I have to take the head off and get it machined?
 
Using the Bosch wcc7 with the double green stripe plugs.  Three have 388 on
the white part, and one has 488 on it.  Wondering if that matters? Would
that indicate that it's a tad bit bigger than the hole?
 
 
Also, do I need the anti-seize goop too to lube the threads?
