Skye,

For higher adventure, a bicycle is prescribed, I think. 

In all honesty, if you put your energy now into learning about your bus and doing some analysis and preventative maintenance, you'll need neither the bike or the motorcycle. But the bike could be fun from time to time.

If you've read Muir, you may be familiar with the concept of becoming one-- in tune -- with your bus. The truth is that Muir and everyone else who really knew/knows their bus spent a lot of time with it. They have proven themselves to themselves in terms of the bus and have learned its foibles and failings.

You'll notice on my signature that I have a '72 Riviera Camper. I've owned the bus since January and haven't driven it yet. I've put many, many hours into it trying to get it ready.

I had to totally rework the brake system, even though most of the lines looked good. They were original lines and stopping is the most important thing. This is the first thing I did. Some of the lines turned out to be right on the edge and cracked when I removed them. In reworking the braking  system, I got intimate with everything under the tires and realized that I was missing some required parts for my emergency braking system...so I made the parts. Not my best work and it may come back to bite me, but I know that if I wind up with my right rear tire jamming on me that I need to pull the cheater bar and big socket from under the folding bed and remove that wheel--and I know I need to keep that cheater bar around because this is not one of my confidence zones. The bus will run and stop fine without the emergency brake. I'll just need a block of wood on a string if I park on a hill. Drop the wood block between the driver and passenger seat and pop it under the driver's tire w!
hen you park. When you get ready to go, you pull the wood block up into the bus by the string...sometimes you have to move the bus a little. But I need the e-brake to pass inspection, so at least I've got one put together for that.

I bought a '77 2.0 liter, fuel-injected (FI) engine for the '72 bus. I wanted the extra power of the later engine and the engine that came with this bus would need EVERYTHING to live again. I inspected that 2.0 liter engine and found that it really needed a rebuild. So I rebuilt it. Perseverance. I've replaced what was worn on this engine and kept what was okay. I measured stuff and inspected it. 

I bought the engine because it's a 2.0 liter, fuel-injected engine. Carburators are simpler to set up, but fuel injection is supposed to be more dependable. I'm a little nervous about how well the expensive fuel-injected components will work, given the wear I found on the engine, so I kept my eyes and ears open and found a guy selling an entire set of fuel-injection components from a '77 bus. I bought them; had to lay out some up-front money that we really couldn't afford, but the total cost, including a spare brain is less than half what the spare brain alone would cost...I was building a confidence zone. I'll keep the spare parts handy.

I had to replace my lifters and camshaft, so I decided to move to hydraulic lifters and camshaft. It was a little more expensive, but the bus will no longer require valve adjustment...which I really don't mind doing...but more importantly, my valves will always be properly adjusted...meaning I'll have less opportunity for head problems due to improper valve adjustment; I'll get better cooling from this engine; and I'll get better power too. 

I found that the '77 2.0 liter engine used a different starter than the '72 and that I needed to replace the bellhousing with one from a '77. I also had to replace my '72 fuel tank with a later fuel tank because the fuel injection has a return fitting for gas that kind of goes in a loop through a pressurized circle called the fuel ring. I cleaned out that tank with acid because it had rust in it.

The '72 was the only year (I think) that VW had a Type 4 engine and no access hatch over the engine compartment. I realized that it would be nearly impossible to make the adjustments I'd need to make without this hatch, so I found one in a junked bus, bought it, cut it out, and welded it into my bus (after cutting this big ass hole over my engine compartment..talk about making you nervous!) I went ahead and did this now, even though I've been pressed for time, because waiting would mean that I'd have to pull the engine, tranny, and fuel tank later to do the job. I'm not a good welder, but it'll work and I got the hatch in place for around $40.

I pulled the CV joints and cleaned them up. The rubber boots were all torn, so I knew they would have been exposed to dirt...meaning they've worn too much. One of them was too bad to even use; the other three are going, but not quite gone, so I cleaned them and will reinstall them once I finish with everything else. In fact, I'm thinking of leaving them off for my test run of the engine. With the axles out of the bus, pulling the engine in case something else goes wrong will be much easier. Once I install the axles, it'll be messy. I'll buy a new CV joint every now and then until I get them all replaced; I'll keep the best one for a spare. I've never had a CV go out on me, but I wouldn't want the experience if I can avoid it. I plan to keep this bus, so it's best to make them new again. Again, I have less confidence in the CVs than I'd like, but I *did* avoid certain on-the-road failure by replacing the one that was totally worn. Even if I don't have the time to replace them, !
I'll still buy a new CV joint and keep it in the bus when I get a chance.

I pulled the wooden floor out of the bus to inspect for rust and then sprayed it with rust converter--use a mask, this stuff will give you cancer. I've already purchased the seal for the front window and will buy a new, non-foggy glass somewhere down the road, but I'll have to repair the window sill when I do and that'll be a weekend-long job with mucho welding and grinding and painting. Maybe even a long weekend. The floor was rotted and I'll have to replace it before my camper interior fits right. I kept the old wood for a pattern, and I've priced what I need at Home Depot--about $50.

I've had to fabricate mounting points for FI components, figure out how to merge the '72 wiring with the '77 engine wiring (I'm almost done with this), hunt down missing, hard-to-find parts (thanks again, Karl, John, and others), clean decades of grease and rust off all manner of parts, figure out how to install the engine by myself (with the tranny attached), etc., etc.

The point of all this and the reason I just spent the last 30 minutes of my life describing what I've done to a bus I haven't even driven yet is to help you get to where you need to be for the level of independence that you've expressed the desire to attain. 

See, I've invested the time to get to know my particular bus. I've peeked underneath the skin at different parts of the bus, instead of just waiting until it breaks and then having a time looking for a part or trying to figure my backup plan. This is the meat and potatoes behind the old phrase &quot;you can't judge a book by it's cover.&quot; Well, if you can't judge a book by it's cover, than what can you judge it by? The answer is as true for buses as it is for books. You must study the thing and learn it; then judge it. Then you will have the proper degree of confidence, or lack thereof.

When I started this adventure, I knew nothing about Type 4 engines or fuel injection. In fact, I've never really even seen another Type 4 engine...unless you count the 1700 that cam pre-disassembled in the cargo bay of my bus. With the help of some very generous and knowledgeable listees and some books, I've managed to get it to within a few days of first fire. I'm hoping I did my part right, but if I've messed up, the recovery will be much easier than the journey to where I am now. I have knowledge now. I have hands and fingers knowledge; the kind you can't get from books or classes or training programs -- I know: I am a professional training designer (Employment thread slipped in here, eh?). I've also built confidence zones. Where I *knew* repairs were needed, I made them; where I'm uncertain, I've tried to minimize the risk or stock spare parts.

One trick I will tell you that will save some headaches: look at the bus as a series of systems. The Bentley Manual, which you need, separates the systems very well. Check the most important systems first: braking and steering; then start looking at power and such as that. A few simple tests, such as a compression test, will give you information about the general health of your bus. To be &quot;homeless&quot; in a Westy -- an ingenious oxymoron -- you need to know how healthy your bus is before you find yourself living in a bus that won't get you where you want to go next.

Thanks for listening to my rant. I hope it helps put things in perspective if they're not already.

Thanks! Joe
