&gt; Hello All:
&gt; 
&gt; This is an odd one.  First, some background.  Last summer I built a
&gt; new engine for my 71 bus, and it's been running well for about 5K

One good thing to include would be what type of engine &amp; how many
carbs.

&gt; of oil about every 250-300 miles.  In the last couple weeks, I
&gt; noticed my oil pressure was dropping to about 20-30 PSI on the
&gt; freeway, where it was about 50 PSI normally.  The funny thing was,

Has the air temp outside increased? Perhaps the engine is just getting
warmer and the oil pressure goes down as the oil gets thinner due to
heat.

&gt; make a difference.  It turns out that wires 1 and 3 made no
&gt; difference in the running of the engine, but 2 and 4 each made the
&gt; engine sputter and run rough.  This would indicate that 1 and 3 are
&gt; not firing, but there's a spark going to all 4 cylinders.  A little

Welllll. mabey, mabey not. It could also mean something mechanical is
causing these two to not have one of the three things needed to run
(compression,fuel,spark) I would first check compression. If there is
none on these two cyls then something mechanical is afoot. Seems
strange that both of these went out. they don't share a head. Other
than oil about the only mechanical pieces they share is crank &amp; cam
&amp; you would notice a broken crank. check compression first &amp; report
what you find out.
