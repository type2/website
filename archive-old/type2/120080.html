&gt; I found this neat tip at aricooled_dot_net wrt distributor grease:

&gt; &gt; This high temperature grease won't fly out onto your points like vaseline, or
&gt; &gt; this on every 3k miles. This is also GREAT for input shaft and throwout
&gt; &gt; bearings (inside the gland nut or flywheel), since it won't get hot and then
&gt; &gt; fly out onto your clutch! Also used for generator or alternator bearings. This
&gt; &gt; is a must for your garage.

&gt; Has anyone tried this on the pilot bearing?

I have a tube of Bosch distributor grease and I have used it on pilot
bearings and shaft.  It works as advertised.

I wouldn't use it for any high-speed bearing, like alternator bearings, as
it is not made for high speed use.
