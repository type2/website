Subject: Re: [T2] speedo working but Odometer does not change!

Sam,

In my 71 the speedometer cable keeps both the speedometer and odometer
moving. Since you changed the grease cap the speedo cable is now
turning it is likely that your odometer problem is unrelated to the
grease cap and cable and is instead a problem with the odometer
itself.

square

&gt; probably the same problem.
