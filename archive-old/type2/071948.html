&gt;I've heard the older Type4 engines had a history of dropping valve

&gt;is still a problem. I went with Mark Stephens for my heads because they
&gt;have historically had a reputation of building better than stock on
&gt;Type4 heads and they offer a good warranty. We'll see how they hold up.

FYI, I bought some Mark Stephens heads too, and the combustion chamber
volumes vary by up to 1 cc.  I thought this was a problem, Mark Stephens
said it was not important and not to worry about it.  Well, maybe it is,
and maybe it isn't, but I *am* going to worry about it.  I'm going to
polish the combustion chambers and round off all the sharp edges (including
the edge of the combustion chamber itself) and then CC them again and take
off material until they are all as close as possible.  This will probably
void my warranty but I don't really care about that - I have a low opinion
of the value of most warranties.  Opinions on the above welcomed.
