Subject: Heading to Emory's campout...

Howdy Volk-a-maniacs,

The crew and I are all going to Emory's campout tonight just south of
McMinnville (Oregon).  Mostly a Porsche show, but they let us in too.  Now
that we have 5 splitty's in the family and on the road, we're looking to even
up the odds a bit.  Come join us if you're in the neighborhood.  We'll be
camped in the back corner of the field where all the splits are.  Say howdy
and introduce yourself.
