&gt;I just did a quickie oil change on the bus.  I had planned an order of 
&gt;filters and a switch to synthetic.  Well, the weather beat the filters 
&gt;here, so I changed out the 30wt for some 20-50 as a temporary fix 
&gt;today.

If you can, look up the viscosity ratings for each of those oils (within the same brand) and see if they are nearly identical. 20w50 normally isn't much of a boost during winter over SAE30.

&gt;I read the spec of 3.2 quarts without filter, added 3, checked, 
&gt;started up and shut down.  Checked again 15 minutes later and I'm high 
&gt;by about half the distance between the marks, shoot!

As a matter of experience, I always fill up 1/2 quart lower than the spec, run the engine, let it sit overnight and check it again in the morning then add more. The stick will let you know you have enough oil but you won't know how much until it's cycled through the system and settled. Measuring the oil you add to the filter isn't enough to get it right the first time.

&gt;Does this call 
&gt;for a drain off or am I within the margin of error?  How much is too 
&gt;much?

Just undo the plug for a few seconds (oil cold of course) and check the dipstick. Repeat until the lever is correct.
