T'aint so.  It just makes getting home to that AC a bit more anticipatable.
Y'all need to just open those windows and enjoy the breeze. :O)

(My first summer in the South, whilst in the military, we enjoyed 120 degree
heat (heat index) field exercises.  Sat under trees in the shade and
sweated.  AC in my bus would be sweet, but I doubt I'll ever have the $ to
do it.)
