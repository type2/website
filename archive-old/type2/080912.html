I just got done with restoring the interior in my 71 westy.  The light =
above the table wasn't working so I patched it to the interior light =
above the drivers area.  I notice a clicking noise coming from the fuse =
box area and when I went out to start the bus the next morning I have =
absolutely no power.  No lights no red or green warning lights nothing, =
the starter does not click.  I thought maybe bad battery so I tested =
that and the charge is full and connections are good.  I replaced the =
fuses that looked marginal and still no juice.  Any suggestions.
Steve
