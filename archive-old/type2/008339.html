Subject: carb linkage/pedal FIXED!!!! YAHOOOO!!!!
To: type2 mailinglist &lt;type2_at_type2_dot_com&gt;

Hey everyone,

Thought I'd like to share the good news! The carb linkage/excessive
travel/throttle sticking problems are no more8-)

I first cleaned off all of the crud and lubed the hinge on the pedal.
Helped some, but not much. I was still not able to get the carb
linkage to fully engage. I crawled under the bus and checked/lubed the
linkage, better, but still no go. I decided to pull the pedal linkage
and see if something was bent. It wasn't. When I was about to give up
and put it back together, I noticed that the linkage that mounts to
the bottom of the bus had a lot of side-to-side play. Hmmm.... also
noticed there was nothing to hold it in place. Pulled a lock-spring
(sorry, don't know the proper term) off of one of my heater control
arms and put it in place....SHAZAM!!! Aparently, it had been missing
for some time and was allowing the linkage to move a bit side-to-side
and that in turn was not allowing the carb linkage to open fully.

Took the bus to the movies and it runs like a new bus! MUCH, MUCH more
power!!!! I was able to take a hill at least 15mph faster than
before!!!!

If you haven't checked your linkage and have a lack of power, try it!
