Subject: Re: [T2] NEW ENGINE

there have been a couple articles in hotvw's about them. they are made in 
brazil by a company whos name i cant recall. the guy at the shop here has 
sold one other one to a guy that built a 2180cc, he told me he has been 
running it a couple mo. with no problems.


&gt;Who manufactures these aluminum cases?  Any feedback in the plus/minus 
&gt;columns out there?
