&lt;&lt; I know this won't change anybodys minds on this, but have you ever done the
&gt; figures on what a semi tractor weighs in comparison to what it tows?  Here
&gt; in Kansas, it is legal on the interstates for a single axle semi tractor to
&gt; pull 3 full sized LOADED semi trailers!!!! &gt;&gt;

We could get really ridiculous and mention Australia where they run trains of
trailers on flat straight roads, but that's got nothing to do with a Bus, 
either...
