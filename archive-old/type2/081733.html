Subject: Re: [T2] unhappy rear end

The rear wheels steer the vehicle. You use the fronts to correct for it.
A loose rear will cause all kinds of tracking problems.


&gt; I just got my 74 single cab out of the shop and the front end is very tight
&gt; and happy...however, since the front end is no longer loose, the loose back
&gt; end rears its ugly head!  It seems that the mechanic has discovered that
&gt; the left rear torsion bar bushings are worn slap out!  I've verified this
&gt; because you can move the entire spring plate front to back (fif) about an
&gt; inch.  Would this looseness cause the rear end to take on a mind of its own
&gt; and cause the back end to sway?  it seems that when driving, the truck
&gt; seems to be steering itself from the rear sometimes (which is
&gt; scary).  Geometry tells me that the effect would be negligible, but it's
&gt; really scary to drive this thing with the rear end wanting to go in all
&gt; directions!  Is this swaying possibly due to the worn out torsion bar
&gt; bushings?  TIA, Greg
