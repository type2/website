&gt; I did happen to see a late Westy stool,
&gt; It's not in particularly great shape, and
&gt; it's not even correct for my model, but
&gt; I always sort of wanted one, so what
&gt; the heck.  I think that this came out of a '78
&gt; brown and white Deluxe---the plaid is sort
&gt; of green and brown.
&gt; My bus is chrome yellow with the
&gt; green/orange/yellow plaid and mustard curtains.  I've been trying
&gt; for months with no luck to find the original type of material


You won't find a green/yellow plaid westy stool because one didn't exist.
Only the deluxe Westies came with a stool from '74-79, which means orange or
blue/green plaid in '74-75, green plaid (with some yellow) in '76-77, or
brown plaid in '78-79. Chrome yellow Westies were not deluxes, hence no
stool offered in that exact plaid color.

By the way, I do have a green plaid stool for sale for $65.  It does contain
the same green and yellow colors as the chrome yellow Westy plaid, but with
more green than yellow (since it came from a sage green Westy).  Of course,
if you already have a good stool but in the wrong color, reupholstering the
lid with correct fabric is the obvious solution.  In a pinch you can cut
some plaid out from the underside of the upper bunk mattress since that area
is never visable.
