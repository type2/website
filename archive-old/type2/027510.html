&gt;Also, my Type 4 engine is leaking oil (big surprise).  I've seen leaks from
&gt;the valve cover gaskets, and also suspect that oil is leaking from the
&gt;pushrod tubes.  In addition, oil appears to be running down the sides of 
&gt;the
&gt;oil filter and dripping off the bottom.  Finally, the oil sump is covered
&gt;with oil (on the outside).
&gt;
&gt;Short of pulling the engine and replacing everything I can reach, Jason
