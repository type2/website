Subject: Re: [T2] What would you do?

Thanks Greg.  I'm in Austin, TX.  It would be a little easier I think if 
I were along the west coast.

I wouldn't mind a manual.  I've thought about just buying another bus 
and in fact I've had mine for sale for a few months without any takers.  
If I could sell mine, I would probably just buy another...

I've check the Samba for a body or even a running camper, but didn't see 
anything that would work for me.  I'm assuming that it would be fairly 
expensive to tow something from say California or Oregon to Texas.

&gt; Bringing in a rust-free chassis is almost always cheaper than doing 
&gt; major rust repair.  WHERE ARE YOU LOCATED??? The supply of rust-free 
&gt; chassis varies widely by location.
