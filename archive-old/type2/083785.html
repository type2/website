&gt; Bull hockey, what they pay is negotiated and you have the right to refuse
&gt; thier &quot;offer&quot;  the books are only guides not diffinitive, also if you have
&gt; records of major work like new tires, engine etc this affects the value

Chuck,

First, what Bob says is absolutely correct. I ought to let one of the
lawyers on the list answer this (I know your out there... you don't need
to come *all* the way out of the closet, just hint a bit, that'll be
enough :-), but...

There are two issues here...  liability and collision.  In the case of
liability, someone else has injured you (by damaging your bus)  you are
entitled under US Law (and the laws of most civilized places) to be made
whole.  That is, you are entitled to recompense that will allow you to
return your vehicle to its previous condition.  In practice, tho, there is
a limit...  If you can be returned to you previous condition by buying a
replacement vehicle for less than the cost of repairing the damage to
yours, the courts will limit damages to that lower, replacement, amount.
that's what &quot;totalling&quot; a vehicle means... the damage to yours is so
severe that it would be cheaper to replace it with a vehicle in similar
condition.  The Kelley books are one way to establish this level of value.
Insurance companies like them because they don't have to expend a lot of
man-hours to find you a replacement vehicle, BUT they are not the only
source!  One other excellent source of values for older VW buses is the
type2 archives!!!  The type2 list and its predecessor lists have always
encouraged &quot;for sale&quot; posts.  Part of the reason is that buying or selling
a bus is dead flat on topic as part of volkswagen bus experience.  The
other reason (sneaky buggers that we are :-) is to establish an archive of
bus values.  Search &quot;for sale&quot; and the yer of your bus.  Look at all the
hits.  Print them.  Bring them with you when you talk to anyone concerning
the accident.

If your bus gets hit and the attorney/agent for the other driver offers
$500 for your all-original, low mile 1978 Deluxe westy, and you come back
with a dozen ads for 1978 buses for sale with an average price of $5000,
then you can start negotiating from a firm and more realistic base.

On Collision, the story is a bit different.  Read your policy.  If it
includes a phrase that value will be determined from some book, Kelley or
other, and you signed on for that fun-filled cruise, then you are stuck
with it.  If it says fair market value, tho... back to the archives!

In any event.... one thing I learned a long time ago is that lawyers
talking to lawyers get better treatment than civilians talking to lawyers.
This is a situation very much like the one we had here a couple weeks ago.
It is one of the sadder facts of life that a woman talking to a mechanic
is not going to get the respect that a man will.  A mechanic talking to a
mechanic will get even more.  If their lawyer gets a call from your
lawyer, then that says to their lawyer &quot;This guy is serious&quot; and the
discussions move to a higher plane.  That surely isn't justice, but it
surely is life :-(
