Regarding all the roof paneling in Chuck's 70 being painted white:
When i bought the 73 Westy the roof had a white colour to it although almost
transparent.
I was giving it a good cleaning and noticed this white &quot;paint&quot; was coming
off.
I stopped there and havn't thought about it since.
The roof seems to me to be very original so maybe it came that way?

Just a comment.
Great to have the list back.
