i had to change my lifters in my motor and am not sure if i have them nasty
little pushrod tube retaining springs on right. they dont seem to sit very
well but they do seem to hold most of the tubes in. however with all the grief
i had getting the old ones out i cant see them going anywhere. anyone got a
detailed pic of where they go?
