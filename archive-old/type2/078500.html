Hi Travis,
    If you feel you have a fuel delivery problem invest in a fuel pressure gauge from a local flaps (friendly local auto parts
store)  and install a long hose on it so the gauge can be monitored while driving.  You could just replace the fuel filter and see
if the trouble goes away. It is usually better/ cheaper to pin point problems.

Subject: [T2] Progressively-Worse Missing/Hesitation


&gt; Hello -
&gt; On recent drives in my 79 bus I'd been noticing that about once every 100
&gt; miles or so (mostly on the freeway), I'd feel the the engine miss ever so
&gt; slightly - just a slight burp or hiccup now and again.  Happened again on
&gt; the way to this year's Xmas destination about 150 miles away.  But on the
&gt; way back home last night, in a howling Columbia Gorge wind, the hiccup
&gt; turned into a serious belch.  Instead of a single miss every so often I
&gt; began to get successive episodes of hesitation at 55-60 MPH, whereas the
&gt; whole bus would shake momentarily.  Then, it would run fine until the next
&gt; one -- and as I drove on the episodes began getting progressively worse and
&gt; closer together, to the point where I was concerned about making it home.
&gt; Sometimes I would go 5 miles without a hitch, and then I'd spend the next 5
&gt; riding out different series of misses occurring every 15-20 seconds or so.
&gt; I did make it and once I did and was driving through town to my
&gt; neighborhood, I noticed that the hesitating  didn't go away at slower
&gt; speeds, as it continued to miss going up the hills to my house.  Strangely,
&gt; the bus seemed to be idling normally once I finally came to a stop at home.
&gt; Now, about a year ago I wrote in about a serious lurching/bucking/hesitation
&gt; problem that turned out to be the result of particles in my gas tank
&gt; clogging up my fuel flow.  I had the clog blown out (albeit without removing
&gt; the crud from the tank) and was told that I would probably not have further
&gt; clog problems as long as I kept my fuel tank at least half full -- my tank
&gt; was well above the 1/2 mark during my entire trip last night, and I've never
&gt; had the problem come back as I always keep it above that level.  Does this
&gt; indeed sound like a return of a fuel tank clog problem (which I'd rather not
&gt; have to deal with) or can you think of something else -- besides a floating
&gt; particle that has finally made it back down to the fuel exit point -- that
&gt; might cause such a sudden degradation in the smooth running of my engine?
&gt; (BTW, my engine is fuel injected.)  Thanks for any ideas you may have.
