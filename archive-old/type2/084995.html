Subject: Re: [T2] dellorto rebuild - correction!!!


&gt;These carbs originally came on the Alfa Romeo Alfetta - late 70's, early 80's.

WRONG!!! I had the flu yesterday and was not very sharp when I wrote this.

The DRLA carbs came on the Alfa Romeo &quot;Alfa Sud&quot; - a front engined, water 
cooled boxer 4 cylinder. It was supposed to be some sort of tribute to the 
Italian South - which is called Sud (say sood or sued) . I don't think that 
model was ever exported to North America.

That's what I pulled my 36mm carbs off of.

The side draft carbs came on the Alfetta. We got the Alfetta in limited 
quantities here. All of the ones that I saw were suffering from terminal rust.

I junked out one of each while I was living in Italy '91-'94.

I still maintain that an Alfa or Fiat catalog is a good source of carb 
parts for Dellortos.
