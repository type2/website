You can find the battery voltage with a multimeter or a test probe. 
Likely the brown with white stripe is ground return.

Assume the voltage floats and don't directly ground anything unless you 
are sure If you want to find the speaker wires, use a 9 volt battery to 
find the speaker because they will click as they move out and in as you 
put 9 volts on them and take it away.

Or take it to a pro who will do what I just said. ;-)
