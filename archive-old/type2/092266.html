Subject: a place for multi weight oil?

Having a very old engine (over 237,000 orig mi) I believe I &quot;blew&quot; the
oil cooler seals on a rather cool morning that followed a heat wave as
we had last spring.  I had 30 w oil in it, and even though this engine
has trouble keeping 20psi when the oil is 240 deg, it goes to 60 on such
a cool day.  I started a dripping that occurs only when it's cold, and
it stops when it's hot (the very second I see the oil pressure go down
to 30 at 190 deg as the relief valve to the cooler opens!  I believe in
single wt oils on consistant hot days, but what do you do when it's 40
on some fall/spring night and 80 the next day?  If we are aware of the
effect of heat on a multiweight, then I see a place for using it when
one no longer is zipping off for 200 mi but perhaps just driving around
home in winter.
   As a physisiologist, I agree that a high oil pressure can be due to 2
things: The pump got a lot stronger in its push (unlikly in cars and
people, except as a function of rpm's or beats per minute) or high
resistance in the pipes.  Like people, one needs a certain amount of
resistance to show the pump is working, but too high a resistance means
there is a narrowing or blockage somewhere.

 Multi grade oils were developed for Joe Q. Average who is too lazy to
&gt; swap to a different weight for temperature differences, and was finding
&gt; that his engine with the 40 weight in it wouldn't spin at -20
&gt; degree's--because he forgot to change the oil.
 It's a convenience that's all-
