Hi listees, Charlie asked me to forward this message I sent to him to
the rest of the list...Art

Charlie;
   From the first time I ever saw a single posting to this list I have
felt
a
part of being in a &quot;family&quot;, a group of folks who have similar interests

(driving a unique vehicle that gets me where I'm headed) and have
witnessed
the
nearly instant outpouring of help when it's needed, I  will pledge the
help
of
whatever is necessary to get a fellow list member back home safely. I
can
usually be able to cough up a hundred bucks or so, unlimited physical
help
in
my humble shade tree shop (ask Mike Gensler, it's humble), whatever
knowlege/experience I can offer and a safe place to park it for the
night.
I
love these critters we call VW's, busses or Bugs, they are all something
we
hold in common.

Thank you Charlie, for being you;

&gt; This week I saw an outpouring of support for a fellow list member.
Now
&gt; admittedly as time passed and we learned more about the situation we
found
&gt; that the money pledged, over 1250 bucks and still coming in, was not
&gt; needed.  It might have been needed!
&gt;
&gt; I felt it was best to be prepared to help if the need DID arise.
Steves
&gt; has given me help in the past and I was simply returning the favor.
Maybe
&gt; I overreacted as one list member implied, or maybe I didn't.  I really

&gt; don't care.  So many folks jumped at the opportunity to come to the
rescue
&gt; in any way they could.  This is just one way I percieve this list as
well
&gt; as in other ways.
&gt;
&gt; A lot of folks helped me on my journey around the country, and I
simply
&gt; feel I must give something back somehow, in the best way I know how.
