Subject: Lower Air Deflectors - Forgotten
Mime-Version: 1.0

While reassembling my engine, I today realized that I left the lower air
deflectors off (DOH!).  What is troubling me is that I got everything
sealed real nice, torqued down perfectly, etc.  Now I am contemplating
whether or not to pull the heads to put them back on.  If it matters, I've
got flaps and a thermostat. ;-)  I am hoping that having this will somehow
make up for the lack of the air deflectors that I am sure you too left off
once before.  My Beetle does not have them or a thermostat and for some
reason that I am not sure of, I have never worried about it on the Beetle,
but the Westy is different.

I am not trying to start another cooling thread I promise.

I guess I am all frusterated because while carrying my generator around the
garage by the pulley with one hand, while saying to myself &quot;You're going to
drop this...This is a bad idea&quot;, I dropped it and warped my fan (DOH
AGAIN!).  Now I am all frusterated and am calling it a day.

Thanks
Derrick
