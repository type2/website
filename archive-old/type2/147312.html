Subject: oh my gosh my locks work!

a picture is worth 1000 words

http://radom_dot_org/gallery/vw/projects/locks/

anyone out there that is still climbing in through your sliding side 
door consider the 30 years of gunk in your locking mechanism.  there are 
two allen screws holding the handle on, 3 phillips that hold the dirty 
spring loaded lock device, and one clip that attaches it to the handle 
on the door.  it was all apart in less than 10 minutes, and now it works 
great!

the bad news is is that the code on the drivers and passenger side locks 
is different.  i'll pull the sliding door lock and see what it says.  
i'm hoping to get the code and have a rear hatch keyed the same.

anyone have an engine bay lock for a 78?
