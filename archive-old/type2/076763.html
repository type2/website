Look at rust and collision damage. They make small magnets to test for rust 
on car bodies. Check with an Auto Body suppl;y store. Not expensive.

Some rust is acceptable because it is easy to fix BUT is it easy for YOU to 
fix. You don't want seam and frame rust. Harder to fix.

I would be content to know where the rust is so at least there are no 
surprises later.

Another method is knocking with your knuckles.

All else can be fixed - some expensive but it can be fixed.

Muir has a good chapter on buying a VW. Get out your Muir and Bentley and 
look at the pics so you know how things should look and you know how all 
the controls work.

Look for missing stuff (accessories). Headliner decent?

Pull up all the mats and carpets that will come up. Anything wet? Rust?

Will he allow you to wet the car down to look for big leaks?

Check the roof - any CB antenna holes?

Drive it on the highway and in town.

Smell the oil for gas.

See what maintenance is needing to be done. If he was sloppy this time, he 
has been sloppy all the time. Figure this is best this bus has looked in a 
long time, people clean up stuff before they sell it.

Ask why he is selling it.

Check for a loose front end - on and off the jacks.

Look under the battery. Rust?

How many taped together wiring connections? Fire hazard?

Windshield wipers work?

Lights all work? if not why? Missing wiring, corrosion, cut wires? I bought 
my first car ('66 Mustang) and they were having wiring troubles. To isolate 
the problem the PO cut ALL of the wires to each of he exterior and interior 
lights. They twisted the headlight wires back together and taped them. No 
brake lights, no reverse lights, etc. I did not notice 'til much later (Home).

Does the vehicle sit level? All busses sag a bit in the back, but I mean 
left to right.

Windows all open and close properly?

Lock work? Inside and out?

Any homemade repairs? Incorrect carburetors or ignition? Muffler decent? 
Heater's in fair to good condition?

Condition of the fuel system? Any fuel leaks?

Check out the heat. Levers work.

Feel the bottom panels and the bottom of the doors.

Check out the radio but test the car without the radio so you can hear the 
car.

When you first arrive and first look at the engine, feel to see if it is 
warm. Did he pre-start the engine or is it cold? If it is warm it may have 
a dead battery he was trying to charge, hard start problem, etc.

When you leave if you bought it - ask for all the papers and books and 
spares he has. He might forget some.

&gt;Hi All,
&gt;
&gt;I may be buying a 73' westy hard top this weekend.  I will probably have
&gt;about 30 minutes to decide if I want it or not since it is located about 2
&gt;hours away.  He has been very open with the condition of the engine and
&gt;exterior/interior and says it runs great, no issues at all.  He has done
&gt;lots of work with the engine.
&gt;
&gt;So,  any tips or tricks on what to look for when I check it out?
&gt;
&gt;Also, what should I expect to pay for something like this.  The paint is
&gt;good, only rust is on the bumpers, 2-3 minor dents, great working engine,
&gt;and the mattress is in good shape.
&gt;Just a ballpark figure....
&gt;
