Subject: crappy bus is no longer

hey all...
just got back from the shop to grab a bite to eat...then I'm off to
finish my job.
I went through the whole clutch cable, bowden tube, and clutch pedal
assembly and could find no problems....so I yoinked the motor by myself
today. (I'm getting too good at it...I shouldn't be pulling motors this
much) anyways...what I found was a busted pressure plate.  A 9-spring
plate...2 of those thin wire clips busted and the screws were out of
adjustment...so I put on a big honkin 3 spring pressure plate (the old
one) and then stuck the motor back in.  now I have to go and hook up the
electrical and air cleaner and it should be back on the road.   ahh
yes...and I replaced that brake line that blew too....so now I have to
bleed the brakes (oh joy!!) and then I should be all set.

thanks to all who replied to my message. I'm a bit happier now that I
have it almost fixed...and I was a bit disgruntled earlier if you all
couldn't tell...
