&gt; &gt; I always thought a very sneaky place to hide stuff would be behind that

&gt; One day, when I have lots of free time (not taken up by repairs on my bus or
&gt; school work), I plan to design a tool box that'll bolt to the undercarriage
&gt; lit the side step or the propane tank. It'll extend about 3 inches below the
&gt; side of the bus and about 1/2 way to the middle of the bus. There is almost 5
&gt; inches of dead air between the bottom lip of the bus and the floor boards, so
&gt; you'd get almost 8 inches of height inside the box. The door would use a piano

on one of my older buses I designed a mount for my spare tire in that
location between the frame and a hex head same size as lug nut thru floor
where I could crank the tire up and down...found out the hard way when you
have a flat that is a hard place to get to. so never repeated the project,
wouldn't have any room on current bus anyway but it was a great place to
get the tire out of the way if you didn't want it on the nose
