&gt;  I have been informed by the esteemed Vdubber aka Hoover that
&gt; I was correct the first time and that it is a 2 stroke 4 cycle.

Yup, keen ol' Hoover is right!  It all boils down to a cycle = 180 
degrees of movement and a cycle = 360 degrees of movement.  This is by no 
means a complex-mechanic's-degree explanation but for those with the 
simplest of minds (like me!), it helps you to understand.  Does this mean 
that a 2 cycle engine would be a 1 stroke 2 cycle then?
