Does anyone happen to know the guy or have the # of the guy that sells tags at
many VW shows in Florida?
I see him at most of the VW shows I go to here, but of course at that time I
didn't need a tag.  He sells the old tags that have the year of the car on
them... which the State of Florida will allow us to register to a car of that
year.
Should anyone have any input it would be greatly appreciated.

Thank You,
Joe
