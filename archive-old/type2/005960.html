I put the cooling flaps &amp; alternator boot on my 1800 type IV while it was out for gas tank replacement.  Is the flap on the oil cooler side letting a percentage of cooling air get to the oil cooler?  It looks like it is just blocking the oil cooler, and directing the cooling air to the cylinders.  Hope I have installed it properly, but it really seemed to be just one way to get it in.

Thanks, Joel Lambert, Atmore, AL  74 westy, 75 bus (daily), 79 bus, wrecked
