Subject: Am confuse!!! (very thecnical)

Good day guys, i hope you can help me....because am very confuse in 
regard of a valves adjustment on an engine that am re-sealing!!!

Here is the deal, it all began when we thought (customer and me)  i was 
working on a 2.0L 78 engine with hydro, along the way when the heads 
were out and i had to remove a lifter wile changing the pushrods tubes 
O-Ring, after many measurement:
Valve diameter = 41mm intake / 34mm Exhaust
Bore and Stoke = 93mm bore / 66mm for stroke
Case = AW014863
Head # = 021-101-371S (still not sure of those number????)

Anyway, to make a very long story short, wile i was almost done with 
this engine, it was time to do the valves as i know now that i have 
solid lifters (i know Vanagon lifter, i hope that Bus's hydro lifter are 
the same?????).... so like always, 006 on #1 and up to #2 
but????????????????
Now that am on #2, intake valve on #1 as now a 1/8in gap????????? 
anyway, as i try to do all other valves and cylinder, i found that all 
valves are way to tight (like if this was hydro lifter - 1 turn in), so 
i do all the valves to 006 anyway...

Here is my problem: as soon as i move to the next cylinder, the one 
before end up with a very loose valve (Mostly intake except for #2), 
that loose is at least 1/8in????? So i say to myself, something is 
really wrong here, so i double check the TDC on #1 (visual piston 
position, pulley position on &quot;0&quot; and distributor position on #1 and on 
notch) Everything is fine, i even check the cam lobe position though the 
lifter hole (looks fine to me but difficult to be sure)  So i go to a 
1.7 am bulding right now , the core is not close so i compare the lobe 
position with both engine, they looks OK to me, but am not sure!!!!

My conclusion: Well, i have none! the only thing i can see is a wrong 
cam or a offset cam position....i don't know what to think.....

Thank a million for any advices!!! Am lost here..... and very tired.

Regards, Ben
