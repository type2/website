&gt; Solvents are stange materials.  Something that dissolves in water
&gt; might be fiercely resistant to paint thinner.  Gunk that laughs
&gt; at mineral spirits may wash away with rubbing alcohol.  The moral
&gt; of this is that if one solvent (mineral spirits) doesn't work,
&gt; try something else.

I have successfully used Lysol Toilet Bowl Cleaner to remove the
brake dust buildup on my plastic '84 Vanagon wheel covers and the
painted wheels themselves.  I have no idea how this will react
with alloys, but it *can* discolor metals.  It makes brake dust
removal very easy, but be sure to *rinse thoroughly* and do not
leave it sitting on surfaces very long.
