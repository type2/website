Subject: Removing tin from under motor (passenger side) to get to
  thermostat

Group,

I'm preparing to put in my new thermostat and while removing the tin I ran
into a problem.  One of the bolts that holds the tin in place is giving me a
problem... the bolt that goes into the middle of the heat exchanger spins
and won't come out.  My guess at this point is that there is a capture nut
behind it (inside the H/E) that has broken loose and is just spinning.  So,
without removing the exhaust, I can't think of how to resolve this - or if
I'm correct in my assumption of the cause.  BTW, I've already put a vice
grip on the bolt... trying to remove the bolt by pulling and tuning at the
same time... no luck.

Your feedback and other thoughts would be appreciated.
