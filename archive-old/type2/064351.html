Subject: Cv's, bearings, linkage...

Hey hey to all
I have a couple of questions that I would like advice on.
1. What is an appropriate solvent for cleaning the grease
out of my wheel bearings so that I may check them. Bentley
says not to use gas but doesn't give any alternatives
They say the gas removes too much grease abd will hurt the
bearings.

2. I have 2 cv boots that are ripped and 2 that are not.
I bought 4 new ones for replacement. Should I go ahead and
do all 4, or sould it be ok to just do the 2 ripped ones?

3. My final question is in regards to the tranny linkage.
My linkage is suffering and needs overhaled. I however,
will not have the time until next spring. My question is
will driving my bus with cruddy linkage do harm to the 
tranny itself?
