On Star Trek Voyager tonight there was a baby blue '74 or '75 (maybe)
hardtop westi that was used as a getaway vehicle. It was pretty cool. If
you are wondering how it was on Star Trek, some of the crew are stuck on
Earth. But anyway, has anyone else seen a westi as a getaway van. 
And yes you have a trekie on your hands (just kidding).
