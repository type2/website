&gt; I don't have experience with setting up an electric fuel pump on a Type 2,
&gt; but in marine applications the Coast Guard specifies a cutoff switch that is
&gt; triggered by a loss of oil pressure.
&gt; 
&gt; It's not as simple as it sounds, because there has to be a special bypass
&gt; circuit to energize the fuel pump for engine start.  After the startup
&gt; sequence, when the engine stops and oil pressure drops the power to the fuel
&gt; pump is cut off.
&gt; 
&gt; This is intended to prevent an electric fuel pump from continuing to operate
&gt; if the engine stops with the ignition still on, which might happen as the
&gt; result of an accidental grounding, collision, etc.

Where do you get those, and how much are they? This sounds like a good thing
to have on a VW; if you lose oil pressure (leakage, oil pump quits working,
whatever) the engine would shut down as a self-preservation measure.
