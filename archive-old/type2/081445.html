Subject: T2 Racing

I realize this thread probably deserves to be dropped, but I seem to
remember reading in a couple of my Porsche histories that the racing shop
used to build T2's with 356 and 911 motors and upgraded suspensions that
were then used by the team when the factory was heavily involved in rallying
all over Europe.  The thought of chugging up the hill in my Westy towards
Turn 9 at Laguna Seca and then dropping down into the Corkscrew gives me the
willies.  I'm sure that at anything more than a fast jog she'd roll over on
her left side and whack the Armco, scaring the bejeesuz out of the
spectators sitting under the trees.  Probably spill their chardonnay and
cucumber sandwiches all over their Ralph Lauren spectating togs, don't you
know.
