Subject: RE: [T2] Bus upholstery

In the past I have purchased kits from an outfit in SoCal called &quot;Pony
Express.  The first kit was through JC Whitney a decade ago (for a bug)
and the second was 6 years ago for my '71 bus.  The second kit was
purchased direct, though they don't like to deal with retail.  I don't
know if they are still around, but the quality is good.  The driver's
seats of both sets are in need of replacement through daily use, but that
is pretty good service.

&gt; Unless you're looking for custom stuff (i.e. Sewfine), TMI is pretty much
&gt; the only supplier of &quot;original style&quot; bus upholstery.  So no matter where
&gt; you buy it (and prices vary greatly), it's likely that you'll get TMI
&gt; upholstery.  Even the custom upholstery suppliers like Sewfine typically
&gt; ship TMI as their entry-level stuff.  But this isn't neccessarily a bad
&gt; thing; I have had no problems with TMi's fit and quality.
