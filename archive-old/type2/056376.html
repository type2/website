Subject: Carbs for Vanagon

Hey. I got an 80 Vanagon, aircooled. The FI on it is a cruel and unfunny
joke. Here's the problem:

Aside from having a crazily mixed up wiring harness, that I think I've
fixed, the fuel injectors seem to get absolutely no voltage. When I test
'em, according to Bentley, my test light does not light. ASide from that,
I dunno WTF is going on. It's very frustrating, especially since I've had
such good luck with my busses ('66 and '71). 

So, I've decided to look into a possible alternative. Carburetors. I know
in Europe, they sold Vanagon's with carbs. I think I'd really like to put
carbs on this thing. They're more trouble free and easier to deal with. 
Does anyone know of A&gt; The kind of carbs to use and B&gt; someone who sells
those kinds of carbs? TIA!
