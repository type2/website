Subject: In need of a distributor Vaccum can.

Good morning and happy 4th to my US neighbor (well, for sunday)..

I sold my spare 009 to a friend, as i have 3 x 73' spare distributors, 
but i realize that if the vaccum can go wrong, well, no need for a 
sprare distributor!!!!!

As anyone of you have one for sale, or know where i could buy one, use 
or new.

Another last question, what about a better battery regulator, am in need 
of a new one but i feel that the old style one doesn't fully charge my 
twin batteries....

Regards, Ben
