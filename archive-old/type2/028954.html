Volks,

We can all save a buck or two by buying foreign (non German) repos. Just
remember we have West Coast Metrics in California that makes there own
rubber products for VW's. These are the highest quality repo parts and the
only new repo rubber parts we'll buy. Be careful when shopping for non
genuine vw parts a cheap price is most likely going to be Mexican or
Taiwanese. I'm not saying it's all junk and it is the cheapest a easiest way
to get the job done. But isn't everyone always complaining about the PO who
messed up this and that. If you want quality repos then make sure its WCM.
That's our philosophy anyway. Put some genuine pride back into that
wonderful machine. As some nutrition specialist say &quot;no junk in the temple&quot;.

&gt; &gt; some bushing between the steering column and the gearbox is damaged.
&gt; &gt; the master cylinder (that i just replaced with a remanuf. one) is
leaking
&gt; &gt; somewhere.
&gt;
&gt; WRT the steering couplers.
&gt; Pulling the steering out of a 68 a few weeks back I did my best to break
&gt; it loose from a cracked ancient coupler. It took shears and determination.
&gt; Those things have braided wire molded inside.
&gt; I have never cut apart an aftermarket one but hopefully they have the wire
&gt; as well. Which brimgs me to the thought.
&gt; I have read posts in the past where people say that they lost all steering
&gt; and others who warn of the exreme hazard of the coupler breaking through.
&gt; I have to say &quot;no way&quot; not with this thing. It could have cracked and
&gt; caused a lot of play in the steering but I cant believe it could come
&gt; apart enough to affect the steering more than 1/4 to 1/3 (im just pulling
&gt; thoughts out of the air here). Which brings me back to the Q about has
&gt; anyone ever cut open an aftermarket coupler.??

The only aftrermarket ones I've seen are made in Mexico they appear to have
only fiber in them * like a tire tread type of material* , and not wire. But
I haven't cut one apart yet.
