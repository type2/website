&gt; If you have a doghouse oil cooler I wouldn't put your Turbo inlet near the

&gt; going straight up and being sucked in by your fan...

THis would also suck hot air off of the transmission and, as was already pointed out, and result
in a nice insulating layer of dirt.  I would think this would be bad since the fan would suck it
in and deposit it on the cooling fins.
