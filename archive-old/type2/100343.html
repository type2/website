Subject: Type 2's  &lt;-&gt;  Toilet (US Version)

TGIF - I've been waiting a full week for this one!!

OK, I went to fix my toilet, and when I was replacing the flush mechanism, I 
noticed that there was a hose that came out of the flusher that fed water 
right down the drain pipe, directly into the bowl.

Wait a minute, this can't be right!!  This is just throwing water into the 
bowl, that was just emptied!!  This has got to be a waste of water.

Why not move this hose so that it fills up the TANK instead of throwing the 
water down the bowl?!?!?   This way, no water would be wasted, and the tank 
would fill up a bit faster..

All right, you say.  EVERY flusher in the USA has this small feed into the 
bowl; it was designed by mechanical (water?) engineers that way; it has been 
proven to work for a hundred years like that; if it was not needed, then you 
can be sure that the toilet manufacturers would NOT have spent the extra 
$.05 for the little  hose!!

But wait a minute, I say.  Isn't it possible that millions of people have 
using a poorly designed flusher mechanism, and that I could have a new, 
revolutionary idea.  After all, I've been flushing toilets for more than  
___ {&lt;-pick a number, I'm not going to give away age...}  years now.  Don't 
I know first hand how it should work??

Toilet &lt;-&gt; type 2 = moral of the story, if you question the wisdom of the 
designers of the type 2, and wish to make your own 'improvements', remember 
to flush twice before looking...  and be sure to join a good auto club.
