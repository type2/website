Subject: Re: [T2] Kerosene: Friday

If its the craft i think they were those engines had blowers and burned 
very high octane with a lot of fancy additives in it.  In a pinch they 
could run on standard gas for a while.  when throttles were opened on 
those kind of craft fuel disappeared very quickly.  At a standard cruise 
i was told that fuel intake wasnt that bad.

&gt; I've read about 10K miles of fuel per new car. Can't substantiate that

&gt; I was in the Navy and our ship supported the invasion on Haiti. We had 
&gt; a couple 500 gallon (I think 500 gallon) bladders (looks like a huge 
&gt; green marsh mellow) dropped each day from a cargo plane to run 4 Seal 
&gt; patrol boats. Awesome boats.
&gt; They had 2 big block V-8 engines that were punched out to 500 ci (or 
&gt; close) with straight exhaust right out the back. They ran on very 
&gt; expensive fuel of some sort. AWESOME to listen to. They were built on 
&gt; Cigarette boat style hulls. Can't remember if they had blowers on those 
&gt; engines or not but I think they did.
&gt;
&gt; I thought to myself how they were using in a few days more fuel than I 
&gt; would in a decade or two...
