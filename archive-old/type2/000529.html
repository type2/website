This isn't a quality replacement, but it's lasted 4 years for me. I got a
piece of roof flashing, thats the stuff which consists of a thin sheet of
lead or possibly aluminum with a bitumen backing. Cut to size, warm up with
a blow lamp a slap into place. It doesn't get too hot here so it will stay
on, but its not so good in the warmer bits of the HE.

Finally though I've found the real thing in a scrap yard.
