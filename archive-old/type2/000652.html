&gt;&gt; OK so maybe I'm overreacting, but does the Type 4 engine ECM for the
&gt;&gt;  FI&gt; use anything that may be affected by the Y2K problem.

Yes, you really should be very careful driving it on 1-1-2000 and not to
forget 29-2-2000 (2000 is a leap year although many people think not!). Also
you have to take into account that since the ECM was probably made in
Germany it is off by 6 to 9 hours from US time so you could start having
problems on new-years eve.

Take care (hey it's Friday!)
