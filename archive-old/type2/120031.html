&gt; &gt; What's everyone using as for battery rating (cranking amps) in there Buses?  I
&gt; &gt; bought one for the 67 Panel that was 450 CCA but seems weak.  I noticed
&gt; &gt; Wal-Mart sale a Max something with 1000 CCA. Anyone had luck with this?
&gt;
&gt; Are you sure that's not 1000 CA _at_32F? Otherwise that's an awful lot of
&gt; energy for a battery that can still fit in your engine compartment.
&gt;
&gt; The smaller size 42 battery will be around 450 CCA. The larger, standard for
&gt; a bus, size 41 battery will have a much higher rating: 40-50% more typical.

IIRC, buses up to my '71, and perhaps beyond, were equipped with the same
battery as bugs, which is logical considering that the engine and starter
were the same.  It's common to put a group 24 battery in though, as they
fit fine, are much easier to find (and probably fresher) and have a bit
more capacity.

Just about any battery will spin a VW engine just fine.  Group 24s
commonly start 7.4 liter Chevys.  I tend to go on the price per month
ratio, which for Pep Boys seems to max out with their 72 month batteries.
Pep Boys is also pretty good about warranty adjustments,  If the battery
doesn't work, you get an adjustment, no &quot;charging system test&quot; required.
