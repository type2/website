&gt;Anyone have good used T4 oil cooler they'd sale?  Pulled the engine out of the
&gt;Bus to check my leak (It's an upright T4), found it was coming from the oil

CIP1 has a Bruck oil cooler for $70:

Although I think their distributors are no good, this oil cooler worked great. You have to modify it to fit the T4 bracket (it would appear that its from another VW/Audi vehicle and repackaged):

Before installation:

1. remove the foam
2. file the tabs in these areas:
