I've just become the proud owner of a '69 Bus. My wife has always wanted a
red '69 VW Bus, and a friend found one in the barn of the place he just
moved into. And he let us have it for $25.00. This particular Bus had been
sitting in a barn for at least 6 years (or I should say that the plates
expired 6 years ago) and looks it. We got it running, put on new tires,
completely rebuilt the braking system ( between the brakes and the rust it's
probably why it was parked) and it moves under it's own will and skill now.

But I have some questions;
1. The shifter has interesting movements and its a gamble as to which gear
it goes into. which parts of the shifter should I be looking at first?
2. The engine seal is so-so how critical is it?
3  It also has serious rust issues where both front seats mount what's the
best way to repair the seat mounts.

TIA
