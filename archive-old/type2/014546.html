Due to an oversight on my part, my '71 Campmobile (&quot;Lurch&quot;) has rolled down a 
hill and become intimate with an oak tree.  The front end is toast.  
According to local advice, I have two options: 1)  Keep it for sentimental 
reasons and put a new (used) nosepiece on it $$$, 2)  Find another camper.  
The whole family loves our camper, and if it is replaced, it would need to be 
as close a match as possible.  
This happened before and I was able to upgrade from a '69 to a '71 -- same 
color (white).  I doubt I can be that lucky again.
I'm a-lookin'
