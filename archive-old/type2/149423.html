Subject: Re: [T2] hydraulic lifter blowout

Dino said:

&quot;When they were
finally removed the bottoms had partially blown out.

&quot;The bottoms of the lifters
showed no wear. When the lifters were disassembled a couple showed major 
wear on
the inside.  Was this due to faulty lifters? Had anyone ever had this
problem?  He is replacing all the lifters.&quot;


Dino, are you getting the -8- lifters back??  I am sure we would ALL like to 
see the bottoms, and the major wear on the insides.
