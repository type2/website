Subject: Re: [T2] heater

If I am understanding what you are doing correctly...

You are replacing the stock fan with a bilge blower, correct??

If so, anything over idle and this will do nothing.  The engine fan rans 
much faster than the bilge blower, which will force the heating system flap 
to stay open, thus only using the engine fan, at idle the flap will switch 
back and your blower will work.

As for a melted blower.  I have had one of those blowers installed on one of 
my buses for years.  I have never had one melt. I thought I did once, but 
once I took out, I found out that it just fell apart (they are just plastic 
fans). The first lasted 2 years, the second has been in for over 4.

The ducting from the cabin is a great idea.  Make sure your heating system 
is completely sealed and insulation along that big long tube under bus 
improves heat more than you would think.

Good Luck,
Snoopy
