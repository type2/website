Subject: Inspecting fuel tank connections
Message-ID: &lt;007301be8da6$0cee8b80$da5fac3e_at_xohgoynt&gt;

Hello.  Vehicle: type 2 ,2 litre,  *NOT* fuel injected, 1979.    Right , I
am now, literally , having bad dreams about  my van catching fire.  I want
to have a look , just a look, at the fuel tank filler hose and also at the
outlet from the tank and any vent outlets etc. that might deserve
inspection.  There are 3 basic questions I would appreciate an answer to.
Q.1 The filler hose is apparently visible if the round plate at the right
hand side of the engine compartment is removed.  I cannot see any screws or
anything holding it on so I am assuming that it is a matter of levering it
off,  but before I do that I'd like some-one to confirm that is the case so
I don't finish up forcing something.  (Any ideas about repair access /
techniques if required,  please).
Q.2 Concerns the plate between the engine compartment and the tank.  I want
to take this off so I can see the tank.  It is held on with screws round the
edge but having taken all these out, it is still held in quite firmly.
Again I don't want to force it out if I've missed something that needs
undoing.  Does anyone have experience of this please.
Q.3.  How many actual exit  points are there from the tank. You know -
vents, outlets, etc. and are they all visible if I manage to get that  plate
off.
Also, while I'm on the subject of vents - I have noticed recently that there
often seems to be a smell of fuel coming from the ...(searches for the
correct term) ..well vents really.  Those slatted sections at the back
corners, at the top.  I've being trying to get a clear picture in my mind of
exactly what leads where but  I'm finding it very difficult. I suppose
everywhere has different emissions  laws leading to different layouts in
this area of the van.  Mine is for the British  market if that's any help.
While there seems to be a certain logic in vents for gas expansion finishing
up smelling of fuel, it seems highly suspect to me and I don't like it at
all.  I'm not going to try repairing things myself - I don't think this is a
situation that requires my dubious mechanical skills, but I would like to be
able to go to a mechanic armed with as much knowledge as possible.  Any
useful information very  much appreciated.  By the way,  Al Brase,  a
campaign to prevent people getting burnt and horribly injured or worse is,
to my mind, very worthy so good on you.  All this stuff about fires makes me
nervous but it's much better than complacency, eh.  Goodwill to all  and
thanks again.
