Back in the late '50s splits did come in a two-tone version which included 
black. The upper half (from the belt line up (including the &quot;v&quot; in the nose) 
was black and the lower half was a color called &quot;sealing wax red&quot;. It was 
predominately found on the deluxe 23 window Type 2s.

I don't believe that color combination lasted past 1960 or so.
