&gt; afraid to take it apart for fear that I would ruin the gaskets.

Joel,

I had a similar problem with my '71 1600DP and isolated the carb as the 
problem.  Cleaning it won't help
if the problem is a vacuum/fuel leak that only manifests itself after 
the engine is warmed up.  You might
try to borrow a carb from someone to confirm that the carb is the 
problem, then you can let the owners
know what it will take to fix it (and how much it'll cost).  That way 
you'll be &quot;sure&quot; instead of charging them
extra $$$ for what you think is a solution.

Good luck,
	t
