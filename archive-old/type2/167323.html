Subject: Nokian tires

Winter is coming and for anyone considering buying a new set of  
Nokian tires,  I've arranged a discount for list members at Tire  
Factory. Detail are here:

http://www.ratwell_dot_com/technical/Nokian.html

$5 off per tire using the coupon code TYPE2. Keep in mind, shipping  
is already free from Tire Factory (and no tax unless you live in  
Michigan).

Nokian tires are not inexpensive but you'll find everyone who's  
bought them has been extremely satisfied.

Hakkapeliitta CS s currently out of stock but I'm told there will be  
more coming very soon.
Hakkapeliitta CQ and Hakkapeliitta C2 are in stock in good quantities.

For specifics on these tires, follow the link on my webpage.
