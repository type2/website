Subject: Brake Job Questions

Hi Gang,

I'm planning on doing a rear brake job on my 77' and had a couple questions.
My challenge here is that I live downtown, so I can't leave a vehicle
sitting with the wheels off for more than a few hours...therefore I need to
have ALL the parts on hand before I start.

1) I'm replacing all the hoses (front &amp; back). I've think I heard there are
braided hoses available. Is there any benefit to braided over OEM rubber,
other than firmness? Anyone know where to get them?

2) I'm doing rear bearings as well, using the busdepot kits. Any other parts
I should maybe have handy?

3) Rear slave cylinders are pretty cheap...should I replace them as a matter
of course even though they don't leak. I suspect they are original...

4) Should I replace all the metal tubing too?  Is this a PITA, and is it a
good idea even if nothing leaks?

5) How likely is it that my drums will need to be resurfaced?

Thanks for any insight,
Rick
