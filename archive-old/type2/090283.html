&gt; also if i pushed in the clutch and let out
&gt; slowly, the groan would go away, until i let off

You mean like the sound a dying CV joint makes?

&gt; got myself all the way across S.dakota, and
&gt; started hittin the backroads home, when she
&gt; finally gave up.
&gt; i started to take off from a stop, and i could
&gt; here some type of grinding noise with no
&gt; acceleration.

Like the sound a CV joint breaking up makes?

&gt; after babyin the accelerator i was
&gt; able to get her up to 4th again. just tryin to
&gt; get as close to home as i possibly could.
&gt; but any form of load on her, and she started
&gt; slippin. until finally, no more;(
&gt; now....my engine is fine. and my problem is some
&gt; where within my drive train. i have that figured
&gt; out. because she starts with no problems. and
&gt; runs amazing cool and strong.

I would say it was somewhere between the transmission output plates and
the axle stubs.

&gt; but when i put her into gear she does nothin.
&gt; the engine keeps runnin while i'm in gear. but
&gt; it's like there's no tranny.

Oh, there *is* a tranny, it is just not connected to the wheels!

&gt; SO......i pulled my engine on the side of the
&gt; road. checked my clutch assembly, but saw no
&gt; problems there.?.?
&gt; with the engine out, i pushed the bus, watching
&gt; and listening to the tranny in all gears, and
&gt; heard no abnormal noises. the drive shaft turns
&gt; freely in neutral, and rotates when being
&gt; pushed.
&gt; but when my girl was towing me to the next gas
&gt; stop, to pull the engine, i was hearing on and
&gt; off groaning.?.?

That was bits of the dead VC rattling.

&gt; so that's where i'm at now. with our bus
&gt; stranded in Yankton, S.Dakota. 2hrs from my
&gt; homebase. loaded with all of our gear.
&gt; i'm plannin on pickin up a truck and trailer
&gt; tommorow to go get her.

Bring a pre-greased spare CV with you, an 8mm six-point allen and a
triple-square tool with you.  Also, a jack, a jack stand, good vice-grips
(JIC), a hammer, and the Sears external C-ring tool.  Oh... maybe a
puller, tho on a bay probably not. Should take 1/2 hour by the side of the
road, and you can drive it home.
