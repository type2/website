&gt; All to say, that I have taken your advice (and my wife's bonus!), and
&gt; ordered a rebuilt engine from busdepot_dot_com. I hope it turns out a
&gt; little better than the GEX, but from what y'all have said about
&gt; busdepot, I'm sure that it will.

I just installed an AVP engine from Bus Depot into a 72 bus. No leaks and
the engine is super smooth: it idles smoothly, revs smooth, accelerates
smoothly. I rebuilt the stock PDSIT carbs and they turned out to be
excellent. It's too bad these buses are too often converted from stock.
 
&gt; I did come up against one difficulty while stripping connections from
&gt; the engine - I couldn't find the O2 sensor. I don't really know what
&gt; I'm looking for... would somebody mind pointing me in the right
&gt; direction? This is an '83 aircooled.

It's on the exhaust pipe, driver's side, near the bumper. It will probably
be hard to remove and you may strip the flats if you use a crescent wrench.
