I've also found that it is much more of a hassle getting into the US, not
Canada.  The Canadians always let me through with hardly any questions at
all.  My girlfriend, however, is of Japanese descent and she gets HUGE
amounts of hassling from the US guards.  They even made her say the pledge
of allegience (sp?) one time, to prove she was a US citizen.  It really
pisses me off, but she doesn't mind.  She has no accent (third generation
born here, she's born in NY) and yet they suspect she's trying to somehow
sneak into the country.  

I guess what I'm saying is, be prepared for some long waits coming into
the US, but don't sweat going into Canada.  I've found Canadians to be
pretty laid back folks, with good senses of humor.  You'll be fine.
