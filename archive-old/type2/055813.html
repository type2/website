Subject: jalousies for stationary windows

hey volks,

yeah, i know jalousies aren't correct for my '60 westy, but i love that
air when camping :-)

anyway, anybody swapped jalousies for stationary side windows? seems
easy enough but i'm not exactly sure where the jalousies screw into.
they look like the loaf jalousies but...  any tips before i get the
windows out and stuck in the rainy midwest.

thanks!

tony
