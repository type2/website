the turnsignal relay is located on the backside of the fuse panel, it is the 
largest of the relays on 70 and later. the silvery relay in front of it  is 
the dimmer relay. disconnect the battery ground strap before you remove it, 
and label the wires. they can't be fixed, but normally relays are cheap.
