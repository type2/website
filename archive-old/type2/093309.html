Subject: Exterior door mirror question

I can't say whether or not this will work for the late style plasic mirror,
but here's what I did to replace the glass in my early bay (71) chrome
mirror:

This mirror is probably not an original, as it had the plastic edge molding
between the mirror glass and the chrome metal housing.  For whatever reason
(probably exposure to UV), the plastic edge molding when south and the
mirror glass fell out of the housing.  After obtaining a new piece of mirror
glass, cut to shape, from my local glass guy, I cut a length of plastic
tubing (about an 1/8 inch OD, came from a friend who is an anesthesiologist,
but probably could find at an aquarium supplier), that was equal to the
perimeter distance around the mirror glass, and an eqaul length of MIG
welding wire (any stiff wire that fits inside the tubing will do).  I pushed
the wire inside the tubing so that about an inch of wire was sticking out
the end of the tubing, then stuck the protruding end of the wire into the
other end of the tubing, so I now had a loop of tubing with the wire inside.
I formed the wire/tubing loop so that it was more or less the shape of the
mirror glass, and then, after placing the glass in the housing and pushing
into place against the spring, stuffed the wire/tubing loop around the edge
of the mirror glass under the rolled lip of the housing.  Done, and so far
it has held up well.

Has anyone ever replaced the mirror in the door mirror of a late baywindow?
I'm not talking about the chrome mirrors but the black plastic mirror.

I broke mine a day or two ago. I'm wondering if there is a method to remove
the old glass and install a new one or if at the factory the edge was
molded to hold the mirror AFTER the glass was inserted.

Any list expertise here?
