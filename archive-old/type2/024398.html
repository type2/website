Subject: Center pin woes resolved
Date: Fri, 1 Dec 2000 17:30:29 -0600 

I've finally got my new center pin installed, this after countless hours and
two center pin kits. I had real troubles with the first kit, which was
bought from a well known bus parts supplier. The kit was German. I think
made by Meier. It was in a blue box. The bushings from this kit did not want
to go in, seemed too big. And after reading and hearing that the '68 and up
bushings didn't need reaming, my heart sank when I tried to slide the pin
through these bushings. Well, I tried reaming them with a brake cylinder
hone. Where do you find a reamer? Then like a fool, I forced the pin through
with a hammer. BIG MISTAKE. I realized this wasn't going to work. In the
end, I ended up removing the front beam, by myself in the rain. Yes it's
heavy. Being careful not to damage anything, the pin only came out with heat
and a lot of hammering. I got the second kit from a FLVWPS. It was made by
Bilstein, and I can't tell you how much easier these bushings and pin went
in, just like the procedures described. I thought maybe I'd gotten the wrong
kit the first time, but both had the same part numbers. So if your kit
doesn't seem to be working you might try to find the Bilstein kit. Thanks
List.
