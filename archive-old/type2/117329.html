&gt; Still rather a newbie, I  have a question...

&gt; So, whilst pondering this, I had an idea.  I'm getting ready to start
&gt; releasing the line of bus repros that I'm currently working on and wondered
&gt; if it would be generally acceptable to listees if I offered a barter.

I personally like swapping

&gt; Needless to say, one of the first items will be those tail light housings

these are avaliable new, I bought complete sets off this list last year,
not very expensive either...
