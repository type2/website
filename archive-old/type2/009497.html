Please Help,.

After the right front dics brake on my 71 bus had been giving me more and 
more problems and finally stopped retracting from contact with the disc, I 
decided to rebuild the caliper today.  I got the pistons off, cleaned them 
and the bores with soem fine grit sandpaper.  Then I cleaned everything in 
brake fluid, gave them a shot of assembly lube and put them back in place 
with a new o-ring and the old, cleaned , dust covers.  After I blead the air 
out of them through the top bleeder valve, (bottom one is broken in the 
whole and being fixed tomorrow), I went out for a test run.....
Worse binding than before!!!!  When I got back home from a ride of about 2 
miles at about 30mph, the luggs were so hot I could not touch them for about 
15 minutes.
My question in WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON|???  I figured if I rebuilt the 
caliper that would solve the bindin problem but now it is worse.  Does 
anyone thing the lack of bleeding from the bottom bolt could have caused 
this problem??
Any and all help is appreciated as I am leaving for a cross country trip on 
thursday!

Thanks
