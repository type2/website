My bus just happens to be bright orange, so I'm thinking about making a large black paper mouth and nose to paste on the front. They'd look just like they were cut out of the bus, using the headlights as the eyes. Walah! - a Great Pumpkin costume for my bus!

could we all come up with?  Gotta be Type2-relevant ideas, or else
