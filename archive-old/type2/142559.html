Subject: Re: [T2] brake/brake pedal problem?

Brake booster has issues... Research it but I think you'll need to replace it. 

Also inspect/replace all of the rubber flexible brake lines if you don't know where they were done (safety issue). When they deteorate (sp?) they can act as brake fluid valves leftting fluid out to a wheel's brake but not back which could cause a problem like yours but most commonly - overheats the brake at that wheel. 

Also inspect for dinged metal brake lines - as in - metal lines dented or crushed by flying rocks. I had a Fiat 131 with weird brakes until I realized that the metal lines were crimped by road debris. This actually shut off my brakes at the rear making the front work much harder and causing alot of nose dive during even mild stops. This is not your case but it is still worth an inspection. Just lay under the bus and visually/physically (with your finger) trace each line from the master cylinder to each wheel. Costs nothing but some time and will give you a moment to inspect the rest of the underside for rust or missing pieces.
