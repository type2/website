FWIW, My wife and I kept pretty careful notes while driving our bus all 
over the western US one summer with different octanes of gas. For our 
1978 automatic tranny Westy, we found that we got slightly better gas 
mileage with 89 octane than with 87 octane, and even better gas mileage 
with 91 octane premium than with the 89. Differences were on the order of 
1-2 mpg. We determined that the most miles per dollar came with 89 (at 
that price structure). We weren't pinging with any of them, except at 
high elevation. At high elevation, the 91 octane didn't ping and the 87 
did. 

You actual mileage may vary. :-^

Drive safely,
