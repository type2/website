&quot;What you are driving absolutely makes a difference in your=20
chances of an encounter.&quot;

Actually, the first &quot;profiling&quot; cases that went before the courts
were predicated on suits brought by owners of VW Busses.
The plaintiffs argued that they were being singled out because
of their vehicle, not by any violation.  The precedent was used
recently to argue, here in NJ, against profiling young African-
American males in luxury cars on the NJ Turnpike.  I will dig
up the case logs if anyone is interested. =20

I agree though that the better shape the bus is in, the less likely
you will get pulled over.  All my rustbuckets have been cop
magnets. =20

PS Still looking for a rust free late westy so I don't get pulled over

74 Super Beetle
76 Hardtop Westy
(both rustbuckets)
