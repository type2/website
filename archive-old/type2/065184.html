Subject: Re: Air filter needed... 

JE said:
i need an air filter for my (well...my fiancee's) '77 FI Westy. i've gone
around to local FLAPS and even a VWFLAPS but they ain't got them. any
suggestions as to where the best place is to order one from?

So I say:
Hmmm... Sounds like the FLAPS situation in Raleigh is pretty weak.
I've bought these filters at several places in S. California, including
lame-ass, generic chains like Chief, VW parts dept.,NAPA, and Kragen.
The last FRAM one I used didn't seem to FIT as well as it should, but I've
never had trouble BUYING one.

Try asking any auto repair shops that do work on VW's in your area where 
they get 'em? You could probably mail order one from Bus Boys, but you'll
grow long in the tooth waiting for your catalog... 

Good luck,
Surfer Bob
