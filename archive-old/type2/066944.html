Well... let's see. I guess that would be to throw the dogs and all into 
the 35' motorhome. Local stops would include the Winchester House, CA, 
and Ripley's in Idaho (world's largest ball of twine). Between Hiltons, 
we'd have to rough it at roadside campgrounds... the satelite dish can 
only pick up 69 stations, with no local programming.

On the reality side, we'll be insulating the canopy on the Toyota and 
camping the great NW. After traveling a bit, I'm finally learning 
there's lots to see here in our own &quot;backyard&quot;.

It would be fun, however, to see about fitting a beetle w/ a car top 
tent and seeing more of the coutry. It might not be as exciting as 
seeing it from a pre-68 VW van, but is unique in its own right.
