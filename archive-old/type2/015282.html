Subject: AFM 018 vs. 020
Message-Id: &lt;3.0.5.32.19990616132232.009ab320_at_mail.bhm.bellsouth_dot_net&gt;

I discovered that my spare AFM is an 020; not an 018 as came with my '77
engine. I recall a recent post regarding the difference between these two,
but I never saw an answer. Are these compatible?

*****************

hey Joe,
Having just discussed AFM's with Karl von Salzen :)
I can tell you that they are compatible.

&gt;from Karl:
76-77 was 018
78 All-79 Fed was 020 [79 Cal was 022 because it has a O2 sensor, also has 
electronic ignition]
If you go to VW for a 018, it subs to the 020. They are interchangable.

good luck with your bus!
