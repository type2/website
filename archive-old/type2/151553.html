Subject: Brake Pad (Caliper)Lube?

The time has come to replace the brake pads on Ursula, my '85 Westy.  All of
the parts have arrived from Bus Depot (thanks Ron!) and I was ready to get
down to business.  When I opened the hardware kit for the front brakes there
was a little pouch of silicone lubricant along with all the other bits and
pieces.  Now I could be crazy, but somehow the thought of putting lubricant
near my brakes just seems a bit stupid...  A look thru my Bentley and Haynes
manuals along with a quick review of the archives left me with more answers
than questions, so I thought I would check in to see what the latest
thinking in whether or not to use the lube, or just go with dry assembly.

Thanks in advance,
Jay Brown
