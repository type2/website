Subject: John Brown's Buses in Harpers Ferry, WV

It's that time again. John Brown's Buses 2003 will be happening October 
17th-19th. We had a nice turnout for the first year, including two Canadian 
buses! I just found out today that we can double up on sites, so it won't 
be as expensive as last year. Check out http://www.johnbrownsbuses_dot_com for 
more info on the camp out and the local attractions. There's also link to 
Greg Potts' pictures of JBB 2002. Come join us!
