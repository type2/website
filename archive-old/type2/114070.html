Subject: Re: [T2] 1978 GE case

&gt;. Couple of ways to
&gt;use 'em...Set 'em off where a small compressor will suck the smoke in and
&gt;force it through a duct or pipe system. If there's any leaks in the system,
&gt;the escaping smoke is easy to see and repair. Especially nice if it's a sweat-
&gt;ed joint as you don't hafta drain any water back to fix it... ;-)

Nah - just hook your VW exhaust pipe to the pipe in question, evacuate the 
building, start the engine, and start pouring a pencil thin stream of 
diesel fuel into the carb... Makes LOTS of smoke and cleans out the carbon 
in your engine. &lt;grin&gt;

Of course you wouldn't want to drink any water out of those pipes for oh, 
about 75 years or 5000 gallons of water - whichever comes first...
