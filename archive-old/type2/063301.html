Subject: rear engine lid seal

Hello
I received the replacement rear engine lid seal and it came in 4
peices. It appears that it is the right circumferance, but
I don't see how it stays in. There is a groove in the seal that
is supposed to go in the metal lip. When I did this it stayed 
for a minute, but didn't seem very secure. Also some of the
4 peices will need a little trimming and I can't decide if
I should have the vertical parts outside or inside of the horizontal
parts. The seal I removed was all one peice and I really
didn't pay enpugh attention to how it was in there.
Thanks for any thoughts, ideas, or suggestions....
