Subject: Re: [T2] Fuel economy results with CDI

&gt; What an awesome improvement. I would not have suspect such a huge jump.
&gt;
&gt;  Before the CDI, I was running about 13.5 MPG for combined city/highway
&gt;  driving (highway speeds of ~68 MPH).
&gt;
&gt;  With CDI and .028 plugs, I pretty much stuck at 13.5 MPG.
&gt;
&gt;  With CDI and .045 plugs, I am at 19.3 MPG.

Which should not be. Personally I would fix the combustion issue rather
than being satisfied with the CDI masking it
