 Well i went up to paoli today and picked up a friends car dolly and cut =
 across 56 to the store and turned right as before,  the 77 vw van was =
 sitting in the guys front yard looking really really ugly, my dad who =
 was my help for the day about puked....ok he broke up laughing at =
 me....notice i said at me, not at the van....well after attempting to =
 convince im i wasnt a lunatic, we worked out butts off rocking the van =
 back and forth trying to get it up on the dolly ramps, after a back =
 breaking 10minutes the two of us managed to get it up on there....
 
 summary of trip home:  lots of wierd looks....
 
 and the bad news.....about two blocks from my house i noticed a wierd =
 rattle sound coming from the van, sounded like a gear grind but louder, =
 i stopped the truck and walked around expecitng a chain to be off or =
 something a didnt see anything....so we drove the rest of the way home =
 with the sound getting louder and louder...well when we turned into the =
 driveway i looked in teh mirror and saw the culprit, both driveshafts =
 were half off, one had come loose from the tranny, the other from the =
 wheel....they didnt appear to break, the bolts just looked like they =
 were neatly back out and it let go....except for road rash on one of =
 them they dont look damaged, they will need new boots adn repacked with =
 grease tho...i might have to replace the one that rubbed the ground....
 
 I spend the rest of the day getting my temporary garage put up, took =
 about 3hrs with two of us, occasionaly 3 of us working on it....looks =
 decent, nice and strong, so im happy, i got it 90 percent done and =
 pulled the 61 electric bug im restoring into it and called it a nite, i =
 still have to put the anchors down into the ground to hold it and finish =
 lacing the fabric down on the sides....
 for 600 bucks, it makes a nice large garage that gives plenty of room to =
 restore a car year round, its the garage from cover-it storage, =

 its 499 plus shipping, came to 610 total...nice warranty also...highly =
 recommended.
 
 my dad asked me and interesting question today, he said...if someone =
 comes up to you tomroow adn offers you 550 for that van would you sell =
 it....i thought for a sec and said ya i quess i would....ever wonder =
 what it would take to make you get rid of your vw project?
