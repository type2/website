Subject: Re: [T2] '76 FI engine?

Amen to that!!  The emails without a face make some people feel they don't
have to live by the rules of politeness that we all need to live in society,
or maybe some people never learned these rules which reflects to a poor
upbringing.  As a teacher, I have to deal, and try to change some of the
rude behavior of students, too bad some &quot;adults&quot; have to live this way too.

I noticed your mistake, but chalked it up to forgetting what type of engine
the posting was about, but some people have to belittle others in order to
make themselves feel smart, very sad for these small minded and insecure
people.

&gt; I apologize for my incorrect posting.  I had my 1776 that I just got
&gt; finished recently in my mind.  My screw up.
&gt; 
&gt; And believe it or not a few listees that will go nameless had to pmail with
&gt; the rudest most cussing out for this mistake..................
&gt; 
&gt; I feel that my posts and help I give are generally helpful.  It is a shame
&gt; that a few faceless cowards resort to using the internet to talk to another
&gt; listee in  a manner that they would not do face to face, or, trust me, they
&gt; would be spitting teeth.

&gt;&gt; At 04:11 PM 1/19/02 -0500, you wrote:
&gt;&gt;&gt; You cannot pull a non-hydraulic lifter without splitting the case. or for

&gt;&gt;&gt; end............
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; HUH???
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Apparently I've been doing the impossible all these years...  And has
&gt;&gt; anyone EVER seen a T4 hydraulic (or solid for that matter) lifter that
&gt;&gt; was mushroomed anywhere.  Now this informations is pretty much
&gt;&gt; true for a type 1 engine, though I'd still be amazed about a hydraulic
&gt;&gt; type 4 retrofit lifter (which is what my local guy installs) mushroomed
&gt;&gt; that far, maybe those crappy slip in T1 lifters.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; We aren't talking apples and oranges here volks the topic of this is the
&gt;&gt; '76 TYPE 4 engine.  You can pull any T4 lifter at any time you darn well
&gt;&gt; please boys and girls after merely pulling the pushrod tubes.  You can
&gt;&gt; even do it on waterboxers but unless you buy expensive collapsible
&gt;&gt; tubes you can't replace those without pulling the head.  Anyway I don't
&gt;&gt; want anyone getting confused here with incorrect information.  You can
&gt;&gt; in fact retrofit hydraulics ON TOP of the ole solid lifter cam though some
&gt;&gt; will warn of this, many have done it and are happy enough with the
&gt; results.
&gt;&gt; You need to secure all of the hydraulic valve train including pushrods,
&gt;&gt; solid rocker spacers, etc. in order to do so.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Anyway for informative hints on the T4 valvetrain please reference
