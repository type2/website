Subject: Tranny bellhousing gasket
Message-ID: &lt;19991109172227.47593.qmail_at_hotmail_dot_com&gt;

Im getting ready to replace the bell housing thats on the tranny in my 
sandrail. Its out of a bus and is the two piece style. When I pulled the 
housing off the donor tranny, there was a gasket between the two pieces. I 
cant find this listed, so does anyone have or or maybe know the part number 
I can ask for?

Thanks,
David
