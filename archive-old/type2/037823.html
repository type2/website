&gt; First, can anyone share with me what the cost of a 71 bus was new...how about 

I bought a dealer demo off the lot in early 72 for $2,195.  This was the
stripped version as it was used as a courier vehicle for the parts dept
and it had a little body damage.

&gt; Second, Bob on the list mentioned a &quot;junkyard&quot; in Elkridge, MD near 
&gt; Baltimore..anyone have any info on this yard...I really need to see if they 
&gt; have a door for my Ghia and some misc. parts for my westy...

I am sure they have some of the parts, however Klaus the owner works full
time in DC and since this yard is on his fathers place he is only there by
appointment.. drop me a private line off list and I will give you his
e-mail address


&gt; rebuild with help from a good friend. I must note this does not make my 
&gt; boyfriend very happy... I'm spending more time on VW's than with him as of 
&gt; late. I keep telling him, just a few more weeks (yeah, right!!!)

sounds like you need to get boyfriend into buses or find a new boyfriend
