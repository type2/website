Subject: Re: &quot;lugging&quot; the engine

it's important to note there are two things going on when you &quot;lug&quot; an
engine.

1) oil pressure at the bearings drops. Obviously, pressure is dependent on
how fast the oil pump is spinning, and when the engine RPMS drop, you have
lower pressure. This combined with a higher LOAD (low gear) can be a
problem.

2) Slower cooler fan. If you only do it once in a while, it's no big deal.
However, if you DRIVE in too long a gear, your engine IS overheating while
you drive, since you have a huge load, and minimal cooling air.

If you shift at 4K and stay above 2K you are fine.
