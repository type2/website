Greetings,
    Just as a thought;  I would always consider what you are willing to 
invest!!!!!!!   
Now-a-days you can purchace a new car and drive it and not worry about the 
next morning starting up, or when your next valve job is coming up.  I look 
it like this:  NO matter what condition the Bus in question is in or how well 
maintained it has been you always need to be ready and aware.  It looks like 
this one has a good history, but thats all it is.  Look to the future and try 
to see what you would be able to to with a  Bus  sitting around that you can 
find  and only spend say $1,000 at the most, but still have that $4,000 left 
to invest, sort of like your cushion.  It's how a poor college student 
thinks! Good luck!!!    

Live Life,
Dan in Reno
