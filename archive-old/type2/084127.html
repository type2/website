&gt; Subject: San Francisco listees
&gt;
&gt; Hi all,
&gt; Due to some business travel, I'm going to be in the San Francisco area for
&gt; about the next month and a half (yes, I'm still going to EveryBus).
&gt;
&gt; If there are any listees in the area who want to meet up at some point,
&gt; please e-mail me off-list.  I'll be there through May 18 so there's plenty
&gt; of time :-)

Just in time for Kelly Park on Sunday, April 7.  Last year we added a late Type 2 class but the showing was a bit disappointing.  If we could get double or triple that this year it would be great.

There's also an open house at Volks Authority on Friday, a Bus centric swap meet on Saturday, and dinner on Saturday night.  Go to www.ggcvvwca_dot_org for details on Kelly Park or go to the Wolfsburg Pacific club site (http://63.230.74.177/newwolfpac/) for details on all the events in their calendar section.

Sean, if you would like a Bus to drive to the show I could loan you my '70 sunroof.
