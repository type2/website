Subject: Re: [T2] Jackstands 

    &gt; Never rely on Jackstands to hold up a vehicle while...

Hell, I jacked up my bug to see why the valve cover was
stuck on so goddamned tight and some clown who couldn't
parallel park backed right into me knocking the car off
the jack.  I saw it coming and came out from under. I'd
have buried my mallet in her if she hadn't peeled away.

Moral: If you want kill 'em, don't come up screaming...
