Subject: thermostat flaps

How involved is it to install some thermostat flaps?  the engine in my '81
westfalia does not currently have the flaps and I was thinking about getting
some from the junk yard.  I recently installed an oil sump temperature gauge
and am surprised at how long it takes the oil to heat up - gonna try to help
it a little..

Thanks!
