Subject: Question on air compressor

I have a 5HP air compressor in my garage for years, and I have an air filter
installed close to it to pull out water.   I run about 50 feet of hose off
of it, and at the end of the hose there is water again.

I use this thing quite frequently, and it really is a pain when sanding
cars, etc., to have water spraying out the vent on your tools.

Is there something I can add in the line close to the tool that can pull out
this water?
