&gt; I appreciate the righteous concern, Dave, but I'm not *that* stoopid. I
&gt; actually *knew* (emphasis on knew) a guy who's vehicle dropped on him (not a
&gt; bus, but heavy enough to do the job).
&gt;
&gt; At first glance it looked like I wouldn't have to crawl under the bus to get
&gt; this done (which is why I asked), but the more I look, the more I think I'll
&gt; be doing some crawling. Jack stands will most definitely be used.

I knew that, Sean. But there others on this list who
would not only consider it for themselves ( as is their
right :) but would advocate that you do the same ( WHY ?).
I have never tried the wooden cribbage, my stands are
rated 12 tons and very stable at maximum extension, with a
wide welded frame base to prevent sinking and collapse.
It takes no time to place them and verify the stability. Just a Habit.
