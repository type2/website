Hi Rick,

I see no cause to get into a shouting match with anyone.  I like both T1 and
T4. In my last post I attempted to clarify... mine is the pursuit of longest
possible life from my T1 engine.  So far, so good.  Time will tell whether
or not it's possible for a T1-tm to last as long  ;-)  You say no way?  I
say it's uncommon but possible.  Bigger and beefier is not always better
than balanced and nimble.  She really is hummer and was built with love and
great attention.

If I owned a T4 equipped Bus, I would love her as well.

One thing I am curious about that maybe you or Jake can answer concerns
valve seats in T4 engines and overheating.  I spoke with my old partner Matt
today who took over our shop. He claims that in the last 8-10 years here in
WA without leaded gas, T4 cylinder head temperatures are commonly in the
450-degree range and that the seats come loose past 525-550 degrees. Almost
every T4 he serviced had exhaust seats pop out, severely blued upper
cylinder walls and some needed *yearly* repair. These all had working EGR
systems, as his experience showed a temperature reduction if the EGR was
intact.  He spent the better part of two years trying to track down the
problem and met with a representative from VWoA and Tom Noble (the largest
VW rebuilder here in the NW several years ago).  The VW rep said they didn't
like selling rebuilt T4 engines &quot;because 50% lost valve seats within 40K
miles&quot;.  Tom Noble said the same and that he voided any warranty if the jugs
were blue. These were regularly serviced, stock grocery getter T4 Buses and
campers.

Have you guys any similar experience and/or come up with a cure?

Steve, I have really enjoyed our discussions about the type 1 vs the type 4
engines and I don't want to get into a heated shouting match, but no matter
what you do to a type 1 engine, it will not outlast a type 4 for very simple
reasons.  This is purely for educational purposes, right?

When they designed a type 4, they really &quot;beefed&quot; up the case, cylinders and
heads.  If you look at a stripped long block type 1 and type 4 side by side
you can easily see what I mean, the type 4 LOOKS stronger and it is.  Then
if you go clear down into the case and compare the cranks and more
importantly the bearings, you will see another BIG difference.  You can't
put those big of bearings on a type 1.  Also look at the cases themselves,
you will notice a big difference in where the head studs mount and the
ribbing between the cylinders.
