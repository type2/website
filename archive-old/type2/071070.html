&lt;&lt; Good news for Montana volks. I just found a supplier of Redline products in
 Kalispell. They carry Redline MTL GL4 synthetic. The place is Terry's Small
 Engine 406-752-1016. I just ordered 4 quarts _at_ $7.95/qt. Terry is sold on
 Redline products and uses it for racing and snowmobiles plus other auto
 applications. &gt;&gt;

i hate to exploite something, but this is an excellent opportunity,  so
without mentioning brand names and getting into a * my brand is better than
your brand * FART then i will just say that if you are interested in an
extremely top of the line synthetic oil, that has never been beaten in any
independent lab, or road test EVER  then email me and i ll send you a catalog
for FREE  and you can order it yourself  warehouse direct at a better than
redline price for a twice as good product.  interested???????
