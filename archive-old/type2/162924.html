Subject: Re: [T2] rapid response to low oil-P

&gt;&gt;  The main  -  almost the only  -  types of motor vehicle in
&gt;&gt;  rural Africa then were Land Rover, Peugeot 403, and VW.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;    The 403 convertible was Lt. Columbo's car...

	If it's tolerable to mention French cars to some extent  ...  ;-)   -
that same friend who'd seized the Splittie in Ghana bought in mid-'64 
a brand-new 403   -  a tax-waiver perk for Yanks returning home from 
Peace Corps service.  He'd stopped in Paris on the way home, gone 
into a main Peugeot showroom, and been proudly offered the 
much-trumpeted just-unveiled new model 404.  &quot;Forget it  -  I want 
the proven 403 which impressed me in Africa&quot; he said.  &quot;But look at 
these Pinin Farina tailfins, sir&quot; the salesmen gushed.  &quot;Unproven  - 
get me a new 403&quot; insisted this unusually far-sighted Yank.  They 
wrote him off as a nutter, and with some difficulty found the last 
new 403 which he'd just got off the ship when I met him.
	If you had the new VW water-cooled bus pushed at you in 1983 
and replied &quot;no, I want the culmination of 4 decades of air-cooled 
development  -  get me the old model&quot;, would that be so crazy?  Well 
anyhow it may qualify as bus content  :-)
