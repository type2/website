Subject: Sticky stuff that holds the plastic on behind the door panel?

What is the sticky stuff that holds the plastic sheet on behind the door
panel?

I am removing the speakers from the drivers door and I want to replace the
plastic sheets with new ones that do not have a hole cut in them for a
speaker.

They currently buzz and flutter because the sticky is tired.

Can I but the plastic inexpensively?  I was going to make new ones but I will
be ordering a few things soon, do any of the bus vendors carry them?

Thank you,

James in Portland, OR
