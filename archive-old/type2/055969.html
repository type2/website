Subject: Re: replacing main jet in Kadrons

Jack,
	Personally, I think a 120 main jet in Kadrons for a 1776 seems right...
My '71 bus (just sold to a friend) is running 110 mains with a 1641, and
it positively screams!
	Preliminaries... The timing is set with a strobe at 28 to 32 degrees
total advance (for a .009 dist only!), revved up??? A dwell meter
reveals the right figure at idle? (I think it's like 48-52 or
something??) Try this, too, while you have the strobe light out: Take
the inductive clamp and clamp it on the other plug wires, one by one,
while pulling the trigger. Each time, rev the engine. Any missing
flashes will indicate a misfire. (It's a good check)... The valves are
adjusted right-on??? Plugs at the right gap? It is very important that
everything is in order BEFORE you deal with the carbs, or else you'll
	Now... since you have a '71 bus, you'll have the front disc brakes with
the brake booster. What you must do when adjusting the carbs is this:
Securely plug BOTH intake manifolds at their vacuum fittings on the
intake manifolds, where the balance tube between the carbs goes. They
must be independent to be adjusted properly! Now, disconnect the
throttle linkage at the right side carburetor so that they, too, operate
independent of each other.
	Remove both air cleaner assemblies, including the bottom plates, from
the carbs. Find the idle mixture screws for both carbs. They will be on
the right sides of the carbs, slightly above the bowls, and pointing at
about a 50 degree angle upwards. (Find the one on the right carb
first... it's easier to find.. then find the one on the left)  Find a
screwdriver that you can use to adjust those screws. It's a little
tricky to get one that will work, but find one...
	As a beginning step, I like to set the idle at about 850 rpm. Set it at
1000 or so if the idle is too rough. Do it in stages, by turning each
carb's idle speed screw (not the mixture screw) down or up by 1/4 turn
until the idle is OK. Use ONE carburetor synchronizer (I have a Uni-syn)
to dial in the carbs until they both have the same vacuum. If the vacuum
is off the gauge, you may screw the center of the uni-syn in or out to
allow for this. But, get the same vacuum when the uni-syn is placed on
top of each carb. 
	Then, shut off the engine. Take your special idle MIXTURE screw
screwdriver and screw the mixture screws in fully (be GENTLE!). Then,
unscrew each one about half to 3/4 of a turn. Restart the motor. Now
what you have to do is find the &quot;sweet spot&quot;... Screw the screws in or
out (probably out for yours) in 1/8-turn increments, for both carbs,
until the idle starts to increase. Once the RPMs have reached their
limit (i.e. you unscrew a little and no difference is noted) then
unscrew another 1/16 turn for each and call that part done. 
	Your idle should have changed notably, idling better and smoother. It
may have changed the idle speed. Recheck the RPMs and re adjust the idle
speed like you did before to about 850. Now, use the uni-syn again to
make the vacuum levels match on each carb by adjusting the idle speed
screws (again, not the mixture screws)... 
	OK... now you must shut off the motor and reinstall the air cleaner
assemblies. Restart the motor. You must reconnect the carb throttle
linkage back to the right side carburetor, without the rpms changing at
all. Usually, the rod's length must be readjusted so that the
socket-part slips on the ball easily. Two 8mm wrenches make this pretty
simple. Just loosen the lock-nut where the right side socket is and
screw it in or out for the right length, then retighten the locknut.
Most of the linkage is adjustable for length, but I was lucky and had
plenty of adjustment on the right side...
	Now, shut off the motor. You may reconnect the vacuum balance tube
between the carburetors.
	One problem here might be a vacuum leak somewhere in the balance tube
setup, or (likely) in the line that goes to the brake booster...
	I installed this motor in a van with an untested brake boosting system.
It did, however, have a terrible-looking line that went up front. I
spent 40 bucks or so down at the hardware store and ended up with a
copper line going most of the way between the carbs, for the vacuum
equalization part of it... maybe 5/16&quot;??? This is important because any
equalization line that will flex WILL rob you of all kinds of power and
make a big flat spot upon acceleration, so I'd try to minimize it if
possible.
	I also got a 5/16&quot;(?) to 1/2&quot; adapter fitting, with a handy cutoff
valve in the middle, if anything forward of it should fail... I could
turn the valve to &quot;off&quot; and limp around until I could fix the problem...
	I plumbed the 1/2&quot; copper line down to the steel line, under the body.
I replaced all the 1/2&quot; rubber, reinforced vacuum booster line with some
clear, semirigid plastic stuff i found at the hardware store as well.
Clamps everywhere... I used rubber or plastic hose sparingly, to
minimize any power loss problems. But... I also left enough for the
whole works to be able to move a bit, naturally, as the engine moves...
	If you have a flexible rubber line between the carbs, it is really akin
to a vacuum leak. The engine will run like crap and you'll be unhappy. I
was unhappy, having done this. Then, one day I revved the engine while I
was feeling of the line. I could feel it &quot;breathe&quot; and realized that i
had used the wrong type. No instructions came with my kit, and I had to
make my best guess at how it all went together... I messed up and used
the wrong line for it...
	This was in addition to hooking my valve cover breather tubes directly
to the intake manifold fittings... It was embarrassing, but I had to
learn the hard way... 

Good luck and let us know!
