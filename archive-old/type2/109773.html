Subject: won't start....sometimes

Installed new cylinders, pistons, heads, new points, plugs, wires, cap, coil, 
condensor, alternator, new double relay, fuel pump, replaced much old fuel 
and vacuum lines, hoseclamps, alternator belt, as well as miscelaneous wiring.

Got it running fine for two days.  The second day of running we backed it up 
a steep driveway (reverse)...kind of sputtered and gave us much less power 
than usual.  Many hours later when we went to leave, it wouldn't start.  Had it 
towed...looked it over, checked a few things, still wouldnt run.  The next 
morning it turned right over and ran fine - the first time.  But after turning it 
off, the second time it wouldnt start at all.  I can smell gasoline, i think 
that is the cold start valve.  After looking at it further and setting the idle 
and timing AGAIN, it ran (last night).  This morning, however, it started 
right up then died after 15-20 seconds of idling.  After that it hasn't started 
since.  I got up at 7 to drive to Cape  Cod to get it looked at by a pro, but 
i'm still here.

I can eliminate a few things:  There is fuel and fuel pressure; the battery 
is fine.  Plus everything we've replaced during this overhaul (listed above).

My initial thought is that the cold start is flooding the engine, so in the 
morning (after sitting all night), the gas has evaporated and the engine is 
dry, so it starts up.  But that wouldn't explain why it died in idle this 
morning, right?  We've been through this engine numerous times, and the only 
conclusion we can make is sometimes it starts, sometimes it doesn't.  One moody motor. 
 See if you can help me, if so that would be great.
