Subject: Front End wobble

Hello all!!!

Well, I've got my bus back from the guy doing the body work. Unfortunately,
he didn't get to finish it all...about 90%, but hey, for the price I paid
($0.00), I can't complain!! Anyways, the problem I have that I'm seeking
advice is this:

When driving down a road and I went through a dip, the front felt like it
was wobbling. The first time it happened, I didn't think about it a whole
lot but a couple of days later, just a little bumpy area on my street
caused it to wobble pretty good. I put it up on stands and looked at all
the steering linkage. The only thing that really stuck out was the bushing
between the drag link and swing arm seemed worn. All the tie rod ends and
ball joints were good and the wheel bearings on both sides were good and
greased well. The steering dampner and shocks look like they could stand
replacing but otherwise I'm dumbfounded. I've checked the archives and
didn't really find anything that helped.

Would worn shocks/dampner and worn bushing cause this or is there something
else I should look at??
