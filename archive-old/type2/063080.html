Subject: rear brake drum removal--help!

Well....I've spent most of the day trying to get the #*&amp;_at_!! right 
rear wheel to turn, on a '70 Breadloaf that's been sitting in covered 
storage for five years WITHOUT the parking brake on.

I've tried, with tire removed:
* squirting half of a can of WD-40 in through the lug bolt holes
* tapping, striking, hitting, and banging the face and sides of the

        brake drum
* with drive shaft removed and cotter pin in place, rattling away on 
        the 46mm nut with an impact wrench--in both directions
* removing 46mm nut, removing axle shaft, and tapping, etc. as in 
        step 2 above

all to no avail : (

I plan on replacing all brake parts except the backing plate, and 
hopefully the drum--so semi-destructive suggestions are welcome!

Thanks in advance!
