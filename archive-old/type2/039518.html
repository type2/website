Today I cleaned all the double relay connections then drove off to end up on
the side of the road.  I changed the points, checked the gap and wiggled the
double relay.  Finally, in desperation I checked the heat temperature sensor
for the third time and realized the connection was loose under the plastic
sleeve.  So I took the sleeve off and connected the wires and vroom.
