Flaps?  The aftermarket fanshroud lacked any provision for such..no holes,
etc.

&gt; Your experience seems to reinforce my general negative feelings about GEX.
&gt; You've done more work on this one than if you had simply bought a
&gt; longblock and parts.  Slapdash work and cheap parts seems to be the norm

Hehe.  Had it been my choice (or had i even been consulted) that would
have probably been the referal i would have made.  Likely a mexi engine.

Personally, i'm rebuilding my own...;)
