Does an adapter exist?..... I've heard of
them,......never seen one avail. in any catalogs ..... are they mere folklore?

Such an adapter exists.  It bolts to the oil pump studs to give you a place 
to bolt to for the rear brace.  I have used one in the past successfully.  Go 
to www.busdepot_dot_com, type in part number 0091480.  It goes for $12.95
