The battery issue has been covered plenty in the past.  Check the type 2
archives.

Actually, just about any 12V battery that will physically fit in the space
is OK.  Many find a Group 24 [size] battery works very well and provides a
substantial reserve for camping, etc.  You could even install a Group 27,
but that's probably overkill for &quot;normal&quot; operations.

FWIW.....

carry a battery for a 76 Transporter, nor do I even have a listing for it.&quot;
