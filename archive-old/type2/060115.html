Subject: RE: Theft prevention

Despite the perception of some that nobody will bother an old Type 2 when 
sweeter fruit is readily available, we've had 3 break-ins on our rather 
scruffy 1970 Campmobile in just over 6 years.  The first was by trashing the 
passenger side front vent window, the second by breaking out the driver's side 
front door window with a big rock (which they left behind as a gesture of 
goodwill), and the third was an attempt to strip parts from the engine 
compartment.  Our engine room lid has a working lock, but I had forgotten to 
lock it after an oil level check.  

&gt;From our (and the police's) perspective the typical break-in is perpetrated by 
a junky looking for anything that can be turned over fast for a few bucks, and 
careful choice of a vehicle victim simply isn't part of their &quot;thought&quot; 
process.

The third incident mentioned above continued in progress even after my wife 
and daughter drove up and parked in front of our bus, then walked back and 
accosted the 3 perpetrators.  My wife spent many years as a juvenile 
corrections officer, and is disinclined to be passive in such situations.  
Only after my daughter ran to the house to call 911 did these idiots finally 
comprehend that they were in jeopardy and amble off into the night.  All the 
while a half dozen neighborhood dogs were going crazy with barking and some 
close neighbors were standing on their porches yelling at these turkeys to 
cease and desist.  Oblivion rules, man.....

I suppose a battery cutoff switch inside a locked engine room would be a 
deterrent to actual theft of a bus, but if some jerk(s) really want to get at 
what's inside they'll just press on regardless and to hell with the 
consequences (if any).
