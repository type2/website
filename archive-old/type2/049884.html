they have mucho safety switches, anything goes wrong the safeties shut the
system down, step by step through the system till you find the problem, if
it is heating without blowing then it will shut down via overheat very
quickly

&gt; While I'm at it... any lock de-icing techniques that people have found useful?
&gt; I've been using hot water in the mornings... It get's pretty below zero up here
&gt; in northern Canada. 

warm your key, lighter under the key for a few seconds before putting in
the lock (HOLD THE KEY WITH GLOVES amhik) repeat as needed
