David,

Wolfsburg would be on the top of the list. You can visit the VW Museum
(great collection) as well as the factory. Hanover has the VW Type 2
factory, its probably easier to get a tour there as it is not a &quot;popular&quot;
as the Wolfsburg plant.

If you are in Stuttgart, there is the Porsche museum which has diesel
Beetle prototype that Porsche was working on for VW back in 52. There is
also Mercedes plant where the last batch of beetle prototypes were built in
38. Mercedes also has an excellent museum.
