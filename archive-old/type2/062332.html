Subject: Re: Hydraulic lifters in an early Type IV case?

&gt;       After all the talk on the list about replacing pushrod tubes, I
&gt;checked mine.  Leaky.  I was wondering if I could also replace my solid
&gt;lifters with hydraulic lifters while the push rods and tubes are out.
&gt;The case is an 1800 that came out of a '74 411.  I only want to make this
&gt;conversion if the case can still supply enough oil to the rest of the
&gt;engine components.

The case is the same, as far as I know.  I'm using hydraulics in a '72 case
with 12,000 trouble-freee miles so far.  One problem - the cam is different
with hydraulic lifters.  You may have to swap your cam for the
hydraulic-lifter one, although I'm really curious as to why the normal cam
wouldn't work, and I'm gonna try it some day to find out.  It looks like
the only difference is the shape of the lobes, and it's a very discreet
change, from eying the two side by side.
