&gt; &gt;I have a Porche 914 2.0 litter that I would like to put in my '68.  I
&gt; &gt;have a couple of questions about the installation.
&gt; &gt;1. Do I need a knew tranny? If so what kind?
&gt; Yes, Porsche, or at least a 75 or later Type IV

i dont think this is the case.  type4 engines were started in 72, and the
porsche engine can use a bus flywheel and pressure plate AFAIK.  So all
you would need from this end would be a flywheel and pressure plate from
a 72 bus. Worst case scenario you would need a 72 or newer
bellhousing/input shaft/throwout bearing/throwout bearing fork, but im
pretty sure that this is the same 71-74.

personally i wouldnt use a 75 or newer bellhousing because that style of
combo takes a more expensive starter... though you can then use a bigger
diameter clutch :)

cant say for sure on a 68 tranny though, it has a lot of one year only
stuff, so you will have to research that more.

But, i have been assured that the bellhousing/input shaft are the same
69-early 74??? regardless you can swap bellhousing/input shafts around
between all 69-79 bus trannies.

Many have put type4 power into 67 and earler busses, so it must be
possible in a 68...

&gt; &gt;5. Is there just a kit to do it all for me?
&gt; Not that I'm aware of. If you engineer a kit for marketing, you could sell
&gt; three of them next year.

joe cali has plans to build your own kit (http://home.att_dot_net/~nextgen/) 
kit. (he has links to a lot of vendors that can help too.) His kit even
includes provisions to run flaps and all cooling systems as stock :)

oregon performance sells a lot of stuff to help put a type4 engine in a
type1 (http://www.spiretech_dot_com/~opshroud/)

also the newsgroup rec.autos.makers.vw.aircooled has a lot of type4 fans
in it, ask your question there as well and you should get a good reply.

never have attempted to do this myself, but these two resources are highly
praised by many who have.  All folks that say to put a type4 engine in a
vehicle with a type1 style engine bay say to convert the engine to an
upright configuration rather than converting the engine bay to fit a type4
in its original configuration....

peas,

Steve

p.s. i have a spare vanagon 2 liter i am thinking of making into a type1
style engine for lots of vroom in my 71 :)  all i really need is a 72-79
engine case as the vanagon has a style of breather not compatible with the
t1 style gen stands.
