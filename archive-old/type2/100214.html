Subject: RPM &amp; MPH

Sorry, no tach installed in my '78, and I have this question:

At 4200 RPM (this is the max horsepower point, [67 HP] right??), and in 
third gear, at what speed would I be traveling.

At 3000 RPM (this is the max torque point, [101 ft lbs] right??), and in 
third gear, at what speed would I be traveling.

Many thanks.

Barry sends
