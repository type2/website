&gt;       Thanks for your reply ! I just have another question: What is a &quot;mexican
&gt;   loaf&quot;, maybe it's because I don't really speak english ???

Sorry for the imprecise language. A &quot;Mexican loaf&quot; is a T2 transporter
built in Mexico, and yes, new ones are being produced there. For several
years they have made watercooled versions of the T2 by putting a 
radiator and grille in front and a gas VW I4 engine in the back.
