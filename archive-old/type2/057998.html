Subject: low compression 

I love my 7:1 1600 DP in my '71 bus.  I'm running a progressive Holly/Weber,
009 set at 30 degrees, extractor, stock valves with cleaned up ports, stock
cam.  I get about 15-16 mpg but I can run 65-75 all day in 100 degrees +.
We've climbed Pike's Peak, (slowly),  been all through Colorado, New Mexico,
Oklahoma, Kansas, Arkansas, and a little into Arizona.  To me, it's worth
the slight loss of power and fuel mileage to get the dependability and
cooler running.  For what it's worth, I've never gotten a higher compression
engine to last this long.
