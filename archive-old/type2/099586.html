Subject: Re: [T2] re Full Flow filters for upright engine

&gt;I am having an engine built on nearly new Mexican cases. I'm getting it
&gt;drilled and tapped for full flow. I have read in the archives that people
&gt;have used Fram HP1 filters for this, since a normal filter will explode at
&gt;the 300psi pre-pressure relief valve pressures here. I am wondering if the
&gt;stock Mann VW filter can take this pressure, or are there any other choices?

For a disposable filter, Gene Berg recommends only the HP1.
He's also got a cleanable/reusable filter that spins on the same
mount.  The advantage being, that you can SEE what's being filtered out,
and so get a heads-up when something just starts to go bye-bye.
