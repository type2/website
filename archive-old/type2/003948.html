Subject: Buses Near The Bay

Hey Folks,
         Interest in my attempt to revive this campout has been light, but I
will be there anyway, sooo, I will make the following offer: I'll cook
dinner, hamburgers (and I use the good stuff, 93/7, not the stuff loaded
with fat) and hot dogs Friday night for anyone who shows up-I'll keep the
grill going 'til around 9:00 PM, maybe later. Saturday morning I'll have
plenty of coffee at my site for anyone who rolls in late. I checked on the
boat trip over to Smith island, and it leaves from the park, $30.00 for
adults, children $15.00 ( I think under 6 was n/c). I believe it leaves at
10:00 am Saturday morning, returning at 3:30 P.M.. Please drop me a line and
let me know if you can make it, more info at the link below. TIA, Jeff
