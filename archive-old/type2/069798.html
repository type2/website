I had the same thing happen. Turned out to be the throw-out bearing
lever had one of the arms break loose. It is a simple repair; but you
must pull the engine :&gt;(

&gt; Hey all,
&gt; Well, I thought my clutch cable had snapped last night, but it turns out that I'm not that lucky.  The pedal is still staying up and I had a helper press the pedal while I watched underneath and the pedal is activating the operating lever like it should be.
&gt; 
&gt; This means that my problem is definitely an internal clutch problem.  So, my question is what the hell happened?  I was coming to a stop, pushed the clutch in and heard a loud *snap* sound, after which the clutch would not disengage.  I  could only make it home by driving using John Muir's shifting without using the clutch method, which I must say works remarkably well.
&gt; 
&gt; The question is what broke?  Clutch plate?  Throwout bearing?  At any rate, the engine will have to come out to investigate.  I'd just as soon do it myself but I think my dad wants to take it to the mechanic to have it fixed.  I don't think I can talk him into pulling the engine.  I'll have the transmission oil seal and the crankshaft main oil seal replaced, as I suspect the clutch will also be oil fouled.
&gt; 
&gt; Any help would be GREATLY appreciated.
&gt;
