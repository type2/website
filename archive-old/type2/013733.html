I often spend as much time preparing a safe work invironment as I spend
on my required repairs.
Drive on ramps were invented to speed up owner oil changes on rear wheel
drive cars and the engines in the front.
They are not a save device to use under drive wheels since the drive
wheels sometimes spin, grap and wow you've run completely over them
damaging your car or sending them flying like a 40 pound bullet.
Think safety guys! If you want to call me a fool while you're in the body
shop or emergency room I'll accept that you will be more careful in the
future.

&gt; front
&gt; and use jackstands.  MB
