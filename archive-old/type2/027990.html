     Hello Matt,
     
     I've had a frustrating time with my '71 Bus' factory sunroof, although 
     mine may be more deteriorated than yours.
     
     When I bought the Bus, the mechanical worm gear/cables (there are two 
     of them) were not functional.  They are intended to travel in a 
     plastic &quot;channel guide&quot; and interact with the hand crank and gear to 
     provide the sunroof movement.  In my case, the channel guide was 
     busted, cables were rusted and kinked and even the seal was bad.  I 
     took it to a sunroof pro.  After giving me an estimate of $800 (parts 
     included) with no warranty, he advised me to make it into a manual.  
     The guy, who says he's been doing this kind of stuff all his life, 
     spoke negatively of VW's sunroof design saying that it works 
     marginally for the bug, but when it comes to the bus, it's the same 
     design used on a piece of metal that is three times as heavy.
     
     What I have since done is replaced the seal (about $120. from Rocky 
     Mountain Motorworks) and added a handle (basic kitchen cabinet style) 
     to the sunroof in order to grab it and push it back, in order to enjoy 
     the awesome summer days we have here in Portland, OR.  
     
     There's just one thing:  how to get the roof to seal.  As of yet, I 
     push the roof into position and wedge a piece of wood in the back 
     corners (using the lip of the ledge that the sunroof is pushed back 
     into when open) to prop the roof flush with the seals.  There's got to 
     be a better way.  I'm considering using hinge-type devices mounted to 
     the roof and connecting with the sunroof portion in order to give it 
     the 2-inch lift it needs.  I haven't perfected anything yet.  Any 
     ideas from the rest of you?
     
     Hope that helps,
     
     Ben

O.K.,  its gettin warm out, and i really want to be able to open the sunroof 
in my 79 Bus. When i got it in the fall, the roof dropped a little bit when i 
turned the crank, but wouldnt open up or seal shut. After a few good rains i 
was convinced it was worth it to caulk up for the winter.  
   I havent messed with it yet, but i really would like to get full use out 
of it this summer. I have been wondering how the inner workings are set up, 
and where to get them and for about how much they would be. i tried checkin 
it all out without breakin the seal, but cant figure it out. If anybody has 
had experiance with these things, please help me formulate some ideas in this 
little head o' mine.
