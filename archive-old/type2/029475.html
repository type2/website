&gt; I live in LA and it overheats and frys the engine all the time. I am looking
&gt; for some ideas on what to do in order to make the engine run cooler?

To be a smart aleck:  Simply figure out what is making it overheat and fix
it!

You need to check your cooling system, timing, mixture, etc.  Engines that
overheat do so because of something wrong, so all you have to do is track
it down!

don't try to fix the problem with add-on gadgets.  The bus should run
correctly in its stock condition.
