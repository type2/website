Subject: Re: [T2] Need Help  - Do you have a favorite Bus Rec  ipe or
  meal?

thanks jaime LOL youre not alone..... course i learned that from a older fellow way back that  i was working with....then....AND said he had cooked that way for along time now ......
   
  funny they made fun of me at times and diffrent folks but they all wanted to try it you know they did hahahahahahaha~!~
   
  i would keep condiments from hardees etc butter,ketchup,mayo etc... in the truck also so that i had whatever i needed for sauce and marinade ... cuase usually didnt have room to tote full bottles of that round with me....
   
  so you were actually never able to do it on a bay engine???????
   
  but waS  able to on a Econoline Van?............
   
  hmm so the bay engine does not get hot enough for this.............
   
  might be able to cook something simple like hmmmm.....Salmon filet maybe?
   
  LMFAO.....

&gt; Skip the frying pan...Wrap in aluminum foil and wire to the

I tried this a couple times... in the aircooled Volks bus....it is hard to 
put food under the engine...
I put it in a tin fry basket..placed it approx where the thermostat is 
located.. general area and found out it really doesn't get hot in the 
&quot;breadbox&quot;..

Then I put the food above the engine tin ,, in the intake area... it really 
stays cooool there,,, that is where the cooling air is circulating.

And,, to booot.. I thought I had it perfect,, a 1 hr drive,, at 350 deg head 
temps...
about 100kms ..... at about 120 kms hr.. the engine runs 350 deg which 
sounded just like the oven temps.
The drive took a little longer as there was traffic which slowed me down, 
which lowered the engine bay temperature , as the head temps didn't get over 
300 deg.

I assumed there would be heat transfer from the head to the tin to the 
cooking tray. Not enough to make the chicken even warm to touch.

I have tried it successfully in a 68 Econoline Van,, it has the oven 
[engine] lid between the passenger and the driver seat... you can place the 
food on top of the heating element [exhaust manifold]... wait 10 minutes,, 
open the lid,,, flip it over.. wait 10 minutes and it is ready to eat! All 
without stopping.

I shouldn't tell the truth about this ,, as I know I have a reputation as 
the guy who cooked the chicken on the way to the picnic....lol but in 
reality,, it was cooked before I left home... I was just hoping to keep it 
warm on the engine.... and wasn't even sucessful at that. I had to warm it 
on the bar-bee
