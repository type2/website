Happy Friday to all,

The decal on my sink/icebox says that the rear facing seat is not to be
used while the vehicle is in motion.  Can anybody shed some more light
on this?  Is it because of no seatbelts or some other reason?  Seems
like the passenger would bump his head with the driver's head.

I picked up a couple of rear seat folding mechanisms for a full width
seat so I am planning to fabricate the rest of it and have a full width
folding bed/seat that will seat three across with seatbelts.  I never
liked the closet anyway.  I also like the idea of the rear facing seat
behind the driver as a place to hide/store a porta potty.  I also have
the fold up table.  I will not install the icebox/sink unit as I think
it takes up too much space.
