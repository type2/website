Subject: Re: [T2] Ring compressor shortcut?

&gt;&gt;Anyone got a easy, fast, shortcut for a ring compressor aside from buying 
&gt;&gt;one
&gt;&gt;
&gt;
So easy it will make you wonder why you didnt think of it. A Mobile VW 
mechanic that used to be in town (Hey Dillan you out there?) showed me a 
cheap trick:

Use a hose clamp. Buy one or two that will fit around the piston and the  
rings. Put oil on the rings and piston and then tighten to compress, but not 
too tight, just enough to compress the rings. Slide the piston into the 
cylinder, and just push gently, and the hose clamp will slide up and off. 
Job done.

Ring compresser = about $2.00.
