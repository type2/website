Subject: Wacky Idea (temp. sensor modification)

I think this idea has some merit - If set up so you can't lean the
mixture and can limit the amount of &quot;richness&quot; to soem reasonable level,
then it seems OK at first glance.

One could use cylinder head temp as a guide - but I suspect that even at
a &quot;perfect&quot; mixture, if one is runnign the bus too hard (up-hill, high
temps, hi speed) then adjusting the fue; mixture to try and compensate
wouldn't solve the root cause of the hi temp problem.  The O2 sensor
though..Hmmmmm...would this work?  Hmmmmm....

---SNIP---
&gt;I've heard a few tales of people wiring a resistor in series with Temp
&gt;Sensor #2 (in L-Jet FI buses) to slightly alter their fuel mixture when
&gt;going to a larger displacement.
&gt;Now, with that in mind, wouldn't it be possible to wire a rheostat in
there
&gt;instead, so the running mixture could be adjusted by the operator? 
&gt;Furthermore, couldn't you put that rheostat on the dashboard, and adjust
the
&gt;mixture while the bus is in motion?
&gt;The first problem, of course, is that with a resistor in series, you can
&gt;only reduce total resistance ( = richer mixture, I believe?), not
increase
said resistance.  



&gt;Secondly, you'd want a good CHT or two on the dash, to monitor the
&gt;temperature in there (or, perhaps even an EGT (Exhaust Gas Temperature)
&gt;gauge if you want to get really airplane-like), and an EGO (Exhaust Gas
&gt;Oxygen) gauge attached to an O2 sensor in the tailpipe to monitor what
the
&gt;mixture's actually like.


Thanks for any input...  :)
