Subject: Alabama

Well, I'm finally able to get away for a few days.  Loading up my dog and my gear in the Bopmobile and I'm headed to Mobile, AL tomorrow.  Never been there, want to see the battleship and all of the other ships and planes in the park, seafood, seafood, and more seafood.  Might make it all the way to Gulf Shores state park if they have any space.

Anybody want to tag along, meet up on the way, have a cup of coffee and a story, etc.   Any particular AIRS list member I should be aware of in case of trouble? I'll be heading down I-59 to Birmingham, then I-65 to Mobile.  Seems I can't make the campouts.  Just have to get away when I can.  Hopefully they won't have any of Don's weather. :)   Wish me luck. Cheers...KR
