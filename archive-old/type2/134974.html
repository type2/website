Subject: Re: [T2] horn/light relay

From: &quot;Jack Stafford&quot; &lt;sunbus_at_earthlink_dot_net&gt;
&gt; My bus is painted L20B Brilliant Orange.  It is often rendered invisible
by...

I picked up some reflective tape from Wally World the other day.  It was on
mark-down sale, so they may be discontinuing it.  I got some white and some
red.  I plan on adding the white along the front and back on the bulge
(what's the proper name for that belt around the bus anyway).  Not sure what
to do with the red yet.
