&gt;I'm pretty sure that icing only occurs when the temperature is between

That has been my experience, but it is only an observation based upon what 
I believe to be a correct analysis of when carb icing has happened to me.
On those occasions when it has occurred, I simply find a spot to pull over, 
make a cup of coffee while the contained engine temperature goes to work on 
the iced area, and then I am off again.

I'll tell you when I have really noticed carb icing; cold and damp days 
when I make a rather long downhill trek in 2nd or 3rd gear. A place that 
comes to mind is Mt. Rainier.
