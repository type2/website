Subject: stripped jets

Hello everyone, (I have been saving this message for a while)
    Last weekend I posted asking some questions about proper jetting for a 
weber 32/36DFAV.  When I was removing the jets to see what size they were, 
the primary main's threads stripped a little.  This was pretty upsetting 
since the I had never removed the jets since I bought the carb new. I 
reinstalled the jets to get my bus running again until I got some different 
sizes.  When I installed the primary main it did not seem to seat properly. 
However the jet treaded in smoothly. Once I had everything back together I 
started it up.  It started and idled fine. The choke also operated properly.  
But if I rev the engine and return it to idle, it starts running unevenly, 
almost stalling. It seems it either not getting enough fuel or too much.  
since then I have fiddled with it some more. I've tried to reseat the primary 
main. I have tried to install the perfect secondary in the mains spot. It 
would not thread in. To me this indicates the threads are messed up. symptoms 
are the same. Here are my questions:
    #1. can anti-seize be installed in jets?
    #2. Why would the it idle fine until I rev it and let it return to idle, 
then run rough? Could it be something besides the jets?
    #3. Can I use Teflon tape to try to seal the primary main?

    Any ideas are appreciated. Thanks for reading my post.
                        Happy Trails,
                        Pete
