Subject: Flywheel end play -- Dial indicator

Chris,

You could press the flywheel toward the case with two C clamps, and
rig something that you would check with a feeler gauge when you remove
the C clamps and pull the flywheel the other way.  We did this during
a panic overnight rebuild of a Formula Vee the night before an SCCA
race.  Got through the race OK, but when we rechecked, we found there
was significant error.

FYI..... dial indicators are not expensive.  Also very useful when you
are determining if you need to install new valve guides.  Check the
Harbor Freight or Amazon (toolcrib) websites and you will be
pleasantly surprised/relieved.  Also many fleamarkets (if you like
that venue) seem to turn up machinists' tools of various kinds.

Subject: Flywheel end play

Just got the drive plate off my old block and I'm in the process of
putting it on new longblock. The question I have is there some way to
measure the end play without a dial gauge? I got the motor from AVP
the paperwork sent with it stated that the flywheel end play had been
set. The new block has the shims in place but I don't have a gauge...
