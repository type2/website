ok forgot the basics,  78, 2 liter, FI, pretty much stock. auto tranny

&gt; this morning as I accelerated off an exit ramp onto the interstate there
&gt; was a &quot;PSSHHWHAP&quot; for lack of a better description,  immediately pulled to
&gt; shoulder and shut it off.   AAA brought me home....

louder than an exhaust system leak

&gt; .  no apparant loss of power
&gt; .  cranks normally no sounds from engine
&gt; .  starts and runs normally, just LOUD!
&gt; .  so far quick look don't see anything loose or missing.
&gt; 
&gt; .....
&gt; my ideas so far

pinned it down to the 3/4 side
&gt; 
&gt; .  pulled exhaust stud (or 2)

nope checked em all, nice and tight

&gt; .  stuck open valve??

nope tops of valves are pretty much where they have been.

&gt; .  pulled head studs?

none that I can see.  can't see upper row but lower row is tight

&gt; .  ?????

broke a edge of a valve???
lost a ring???   doesn't sound right, BTDT

Thanks for the brainstorming.  looks like the head comes off
