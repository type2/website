&gt;The '72-'79 trans will not fall to the ground when you remove the engine.
&gt;It does not hang by the CVs, it will not fall, you do not need to support
&gt;it.  It is held in by two bolts that secure the bellhousing to the frame of
&gt;the Bus.

In fact this makes the '72-'79 design a major PITA in my opinion, but Sean
is right, no way on earth it will fall anywhere unless you pull the two
&quot;special&quot;
bolts holding the carrier in place.  Funny that, Sean and I have had the
discussion, if you know busses and see that bolt laying about, you know
instantly what it is, nothing else quite like it.

&gt;The '68-'71 transmission is NOT supported independently of the engine, and
&gt;it WILL fall to the ground if you take the engine out without supporting the
&gt;transmission.

A trivial addition is of course the Vanagon 091 has no rear carrier and will
indeed drop, a glorious design as it allows you to easily pull the trans and
engine as a unit taking out only 8 bolts (OK not counting the CV's but they
go quick with an air ratchet) or to leave it in place and pivot the tranny
down
to make alignment a snap compared to the evil '72-'79 design.  For either
the '68-'71 or '80-'92 I rec using a small hydraulic jack under the
bellhousing
to allow you to easily adjust the angle during in/out or just a regular ole
jackstand, milkcrate, lump of wood, whatever.  It isn't that heavy, even the
autobox.
