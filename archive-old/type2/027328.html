Having driven in California, Eastern &amp; Western Europe, plus Southern Africa, 
in the past, I have to admit that British motoring laws do seem much more 
sensible than many!

When I have driven in thick fog, during night-time, using my low-mounted, 7 
inch, Lucas 20/20 Homofocal, Rally fog lamps, in conjunction with only 
parking cum side lights, there has been virtually no glare back. Zones of 
visibility have extended from kerb-to-kerb, either side of the vehicle, from 
5 yards in front, to at least 100 yards forward. In the day-time, it makes 
little differance, what lights you use, with regard to what you can see with 
them.

If you intend to fit only a rear fog lamp, may I suggest using a a VW Type 2 
or Type 1, 3 or 4 heated rear-window switch, substituting an unmarked hazard 
warning switch lens, or even make your own coloured lens out of 
self-coloured, translucent acrylic, as I have done for my three VW Type 4 
heated rear-window switches, used on my 1973 VW '1600' Type 2, for rear &amp; 
front fog lamps, plus auxiliary driving lamps.

Regards.
