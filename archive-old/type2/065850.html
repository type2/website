Subject: Dual Kadrons FS

Hi folks,

I'm selling off some used dual Kadrons I recently acquired and will not have
the time to fiddle with. The price is $75.  They are the Solex 40/44 with
steel dual port manifolds and chrome air filter assemblies, no linkage included.

I don't have instructions/diagrams to go with these.  They appear to be in
good condition with the exception of one piece on one carb: (not sure what
it's called but I can describe it:  looking down the throat of one carb
there's an aluminum eyelet looking piece that has a spring/screw going into
its side--this piece is damaged on one carb and will need to be replaced).
I haven't investigated so I wouldn't know what this little piece costs/or
where to get it or if it's something included in a rebuild kit.
