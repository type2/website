I always thought that my idea to be
&gt;different would be to take a bus and then get it perfect and then make it
&gt;look like rust and cancer with the custom paint job?

That is different enough to only come from the mind of an artist. Hard
catalyst high grade enamel topcoat in dead flat grey to mimic primer. Rust
red anti-rust enhancement of seams. Black holes painted on pristine running
boards. Illusion of dents in smooth panels. Aftermarket stickers on Bosch
parts. Patterns painted on the axel shafts to make them appear bent, but
straight edge proves them true. Permanent dog piss stains painted on
wheels. Greasy finger prints and smears painted about. Turn signal switch
appears to be hanging loose but upon inspection is firm, and function
nominal. Wires underdash with quicky splices and wads of tape with ends
hanging loose, the that hook to nothing, just provide ambiance. Cracks
painted on the dizzy cap. Oily dirt build up painted on the bone dry motor
case with drops of amber epoxy collecting at low points.

Truely inspired, fer sur. It just might win people's choice at a big VW
meet. I would vote for it fer sur.
