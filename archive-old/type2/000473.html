You say it's listed in your catalog. I'd really like to see it as I paid for
my catalog about three years ago and have yet to receive it. Are they out
now? TBear.
PS When you guys first starting posting, I called and someone said they
would send me a catalog. I have not gotten it yet. I guess some things never
change.
