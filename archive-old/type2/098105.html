Subject: Re: [T2] Don't cut a hole for the sender!

&gt; &lt;&lt; It is not really neccessary to cut an access hole for the fuel sender. &gt;&gt;
&gt; 
&gt; I second that!  Once you've loosened the panel in front of the engine and 
&gt; moved teh top of it back, the sender is removed from the top of the tank by 
&gt; giving it less than a quarter of a turn and then lifting it up, to the side 
&gt; and out.  Reverse the process to install the new one.
&gt; 
&gt; mark

If you have a 73-79 that is. For those that don't know, the sender on 68-72 is 
a cylinrical affair that's at least 5 or 6 inches tall. No way can you wiggle 
that thing out with the gas tank in place. A hole will most likely be cut in 
the deck before my tank goes back in.
