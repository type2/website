&gt; ok here is the deal on my tire questions.
&gt; 
&gt; a lot of the archives mention getting stronger sidewall strength in your
&gt; tires ( ie light truck tires etc.)  but have many of you actually searched
&gt; tire shops for these tires.  light truck tires rarely have much more side
&gt; wall strength as the archives would let you believe are needed.  i had a
&gt; bunch of mails sent to me last week from people who use certain brands and i
&gt; looked into each and every brand the listees sent me.
&gt; 
&gt; none of them were acceptable.  all were under the 1520 lb minimum the bus
&gt; requires ( stock).  one member mentioned that it would be worth every penny
&gt; spent to buy at least a 6 ply or even an 8 ply.  the only thing i found in
&gt; those parameters was what the tire shops called *a trailer tire* .  a
&gt; superheavy duty tire that has a high load capacity ( capacity only determined
&gt; by how big your wallet is )  and had the highest sidewall strength. they had
&gt; a 6 and an 8 ply.   my question is since these are called * trailer* tires
&gt; could they be used with good success on a van??  trailer tires are made to be
&gt; just that...only used on a trailer....no turning, no curb checks, smooth ride
&gt; not needed...only that they be super strong.
&gt; 
&gt; anyone have any extra info on this...or possibly WHERE  to find good tires.
&gt; the tire rack is a good web site but doesnt carry the specs on each tire you
&gt; might be interested in ( weight ratio, aspect ratio, sidewall ply
&gt; etc.)........
&gt; 
&gt; fwiw..the van is a work van....i haul loads in it regularly.  heavy loads up
&gt; to 2500+ is only once a month.
&gt; 
&gt; am i being paranoid....or should i just go buy a set of dunlop sp-40s and
&gt; call it good???

I have never gotten a good answer on the trailer tire question. LT's do
have a stiffer sidewall, but not necessarily a heavier load rating. LT
loadrange C's are not rated for the load of a LT loadrange D. 

Are we talking about 15&quot; or 14&quot; rims?

In my experience, good 14&quot; 6- or 8- ply tires are available in loadrange
c and d ( and remember, the number refers to EACH tire, not the total 4
or total axle...)On my '65 splitty I run a tire called &quot;trailbuster&quot;
27X8.5, available through Beggs tire factory all through the western
part of the US.  It is about the size of a 205/75, and is 26.75 &quot; in
total height, nice for a reduction box rear end. It is loadrange c,
6-ply rated, with about 1750 lbs per tire at 50  psi. 
I just ran them 8000 miles through mexico, loaded to the gills (4600 lbs
in a bus weighing 2600 empty) and was delighted.

I have gone looking for 15&quot; tires for earlier buses, and have absolutely
no lock finding a 205/75R15 with LT 6- or 8-ply sidewalls. *EXCEPT* in a
trailer Tire.

So what the heck is the difference between trailer tires and others?????

The sidewall stiffness ( not necessarily strength) is very nice for
handling in a taller tire like this, as it lessens the &quot;tire wag&quot;
experienced by many buses. I refuse to run a passenger rated tire
because of the feel during cornering. 

BTW this thread has been gone over and over in the vintagebus list,
since the taller tires needed with reduction gears and potential of 15&quot;
stock rims makes it an even bigger issue for splitty owners than bubble. 
But still no good answer......maybe the late model people can solve it
once and for all.......:)
