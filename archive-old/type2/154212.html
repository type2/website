Subject: Re: [T2] FI to carb conversion

Another plus about FI is how forgiving it is.......if everything is running 
fine it runs like a champ.  If there is a vac leak here or there, the van 
generally will still run!

There are inexpensive books to buy on ebay that were dealer manuals.  I have 
all these, and after reading them a few times, was ready to handle anything.

As a matter of fact, when the local VW dealer has a customer with an AFC 
fuel injected car, they send them to me!  At my house!

The system is truly child's play.

Search for VW AFC manual...........
