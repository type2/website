Subject: real bodywork estimate

Hey everyone,
  I was wondering what kind of price I am looking at to get quality bodywork 
done on a bus.  I have a 69 which needs;
1. Both quarters in front of rear wheels replaced
2. New battery tray welded in, as well as a small piece of the wheel
   arch in front of the tray
3. A little work over drivers side dogleg
4. At least one rear corner
5. Small bit of rust beginning at windshield
6. one small hole under slider
7. Rust treatment in a few areas
8. removal of parking lot dings, and bondo using as little filler as
   possible.
I want to essentially do a restoration on the outside of the body and not 
skimp on quality.  This bus is from West Texas and has only been up here in 
Vermont a short time.  She is solid and deserves the effort.
Also if anyone knows someone in the New England area who specializes in Vw 
bodywork, could you let me know?   Thanks    BG
