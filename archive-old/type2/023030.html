&gt;As far as I'm concerned the only good reasons for taking the spark plugs out
&gt;are: its time to replace them; you are playing with your carburation and

&gt;I'm a believer in, &quot;If it ain't broke, don't fix it.&quot;  Just do regular
&gt;maintenance to keep it that way.  I've had a spark plug strip out 100 miles
&gt;from home (P/O cross threaded it) and don't like to tempt fate by taking
&gt;plugs out just because.
