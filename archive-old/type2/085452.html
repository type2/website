Subject: Subject: Re: [T2] Is my buss worth working on

A look at your URL revealed many things, like the fact that your bus is in
much better shape than mine!!
It depends on your interest and willing to work level. When Greg told me
&quot;your bus will never be a show bus&quot; it was somewhat liberating. I was able
to fix my bus with simply driving it in mind. Nothing fancy, just fun.
From what I can tell, you don't have very much to worry about here.
The body is quite good, Your cargo floor seems to have seen some dempness so
I would reccomend stripping it, rust converting it, and repainting it.
I had the same holes in my wheel wells, a little fancy tinwork for a patch
does the trick, you could easily pop-rivet this into place, and with some
undercoat noone would be the wiser.
If you are just looking for a driver, not a show car, I'd say you have a
very decent start.

Perhaps someone else could explain all that grease on and around your tranny
tho, that was my only real concern.

Adam
