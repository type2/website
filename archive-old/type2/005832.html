Subject: 71 Brake booster to a 68 beam
Date: Fri, 4 Aug 2000 17:50:11 -0700
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

Has anyone done this? I know that you need the check valve in the vacuum
line. I've already put the 71 disc brakes on my trailing arms and would like
to have the power assisted brakes also. Are all boosters 71 to 79 the same
or is it 72 to 79? I see in parts books they separate the M/C at 72 to 79 as
being the same. I know if you put a 68 beam on a split bus that it will
raise the front end about 2 inches but if I can make an adapter for the 72
or newer beam to fit on my 68 DC I might try that instead. Any thoughts or
comments. I just like the feeling of the power assisted brakes and my wife
will drive the bus with them, without no way!
Thanks,
Britt
