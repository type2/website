Richard Atwell wrote of &quot;marine clean&quot; :

&gt;Yes, it's biodegradable.

as I stated, my tank's pretty clean for starters, but the bus it came out of is a year from being roadworthy. will marine clean be all I need to do the tank, and what about the tank sitting for a year, should I do something to it first?

thanks to all,

Billy
