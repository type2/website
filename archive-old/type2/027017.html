Eddie,
   Since you have the 12 volts at the fuel pump, and it still doesn't run, 
check to make sure that you have a good ground.  Also, keep in mind that the 
fuel injection doesn't use the run of the mill fuel pump.  It's one that 
makes higher pressure, in the neighborhood of 30PSI if memory serves me 
correctly.  50 dollars for a new FI fuel pump sounds too cheap.  Either it's 
not the right kind or it's plain no good. Also, is the pump mounted lower 
than the fuel tank so gravity can get the fuel to the pump?  That's how it's 
supposed to be.
Anyway, hope this helps.
