Subject: Re: [T2] still no spark......

&gt;   Well i have tried everything everyone has said to try and get spark out
&gt; of my coil.  I still don't.  I have power at both the pos and neg screws on
&gt; the coil, but never out of the main wire.  I even put a test light down in
&gt; there to make sure the wire wasn't bad.  Please if anyone could help... i
&gt; really wanted to drive my bus to bonnaroo on thursday but it looks like i
&gt; will be in regular car :(

Whoa, stop. If you have power at BOTH terminals, that means the points are
open. Leave the test light on the negative side, that is the one with the
green lead going to the dizzy, and rotate the engine with a wrench on the alt.
pulley nut. Watch the test light. Every time the points close, the light
should go out. If it does NOT go out, you have a problem with the points.
Either they are not closing and touching or you have grease/oil on the face of
them.
The light HAS to go out for the secondary circuit of the coil to collapse and
send out a spark when they open again.
