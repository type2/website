Subject: Re: dwell angle: why such a broad range of values?

&gt;From what I understand, 50 degrees dwell is perfect, but when I worked in a
shop we always set them at 48 so as they built up deposits they would move
through the 50 degree range.

&gt; Fellow point-setters:
&gt; Why is VW so generous in specifying the dwell angle on their distributors
&gt; (New points: 42-58 degreees), while other vehicles, also using the Bosch,
&gt; have a tighter spec (BMW 1600: 60 + or - 1 degree). Has anyone got data on
&gt; what exactly is the best dwell angle setting? I do find the BMW runs better
&gt; when set to spec. Wouldn't the VW also do so, if we knew its optimal
&gt; setting?
