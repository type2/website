Subject: Re: [T2] towing question

Take the advice about heavy vehicle and braking very seriously...  Last
summer I towed a westy from OH to AZ (at least I'm moving in the right
direction!).  I used a trailer with electric brakes.  Just as an experiment
I turned off the electric brake controller and tried to stop hard from 65-70
mph.  It was not a pretty site, with the controller on and properly adjusted
I hardly knew the trailer/vehicle was there.  As an aside, I was towing with
a F*rd Expedition with the big motor and towing package.  Leave plenty of
room for stopping!!!  BTW when the wind gets the trailer fishtailing), a
slight activation of the electric brake controller can straighten things
right out.

&gt; Matt,
&gt;
&gt; I should probably not jump in, as my post is very &quot;metoo&quot;, but...
&gt;
&gt; If you lift the rear and tie off the steering wheel, you can tow it to
&gt; alpha centauri.  I'd regrease the wheel bearings every light year or so,
&gt; but there is no limit or problem with towing from this end.
&gt;
&gt; If you lift the front, then (a) you have to be sure the trans fluid level
&gt; is good and (b) that it isn't leaking out too too fast.  If both of those
&gt; conditions are met, you are fine for ~200K miles or so.
&gt;
&gt; If the trans is a leaker or you are nervous, you can pull the outboard end
&gt; of each half-shaft (or the whole thing if you are feeling frisky) in an
&gt; hour or less with the triple-square and/or allen head socket and again you
&gt; are off to the stars!
&gt;
&gt; And as Dave and Chris both said... having said that, I like a flatbed
&gt; truck for towing :-) (And a towing vehicle that is at least 2x as heavy as
&gt; the bus!  Braking and stopping is the real problem with towing.)
