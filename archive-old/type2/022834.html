Here's the source you need with contact information for the auto literature 
you need............

Logan Gray
P.O. Box 922
Beaverton, OR
        97075-0922
503.292.7747 (evenings only)
503.292.5636 (24 hour fax)

It's awfully nice to discover that one of the best possible resources is 
right in your own neighborhood!  That was my happy discovery with Logan.  
This gentleman has most anything you'd need if its VW literature in nature.  
Should you decide to call you will most likely run into a machine.  Logan 
will call you back in a few days.  Everyone I have referred to him the past 
has declared the wait well worth while.
Best of luck in your search,

Mike
