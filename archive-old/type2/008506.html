&gt;  ...my dad ... sugested a Mazda Rotary Engine 

 They don't have enough torque to use in a bus. Realistically, there's not
much point in having masses of power in a bus as the beast doesn't have the
aerodynamics, suspension or handling to go fast. What most people want
is the ability to accelerate, hold speed into a headwind and climb hills
(though some want to do all three at the same time, and that _does_ need
serious horsepower!!!).
 That means an engine with plenty of torque: notice that VW upped capacity
from 1700, through 1800 to 2000cc without a significant HP increase: just
a much fatter torque curve.
 Now this is a simplification: you can use the 200bhp in a rotary if you
put in enough effort, but to do so you need to regear the drivetrain so that
the engine revs high enough to be able to work, and that will make the thing
more difficult to drive, even when you've dealt with the conversion
hassles. To get good driveability you want good torque at low revs, and that
pretty much equates to a big engine.
 They say there's no substitute for cubes: it's not strictly true, as Colin
Chapman and Ferry Porsche have proven, but in a bus you've already given up
the alternatives, since it's neither light nor slippery. 

 Torque is king.

Cheers,
