Subject: Engine help please!

hello,
I have a 1974 westy with an 1.8L engine with duel carbs, automaic
transmission. The engine crank won't turn over so i decided to drop  the
engine.  i removed carbs, and electrical wiring from engine. also the 4
bolts that hold the trans to the engine. as well i removed the two bolts
from the engine mounts, on both sides (i have a chain round the trans
ready to support its weight). I am following the directions in the
Robert Bently manual. it says to remove 4 bolts from the torque
converter through the hole that was machined in the flange next to where
the engine and trans join. this involves turning the crank so that you
can visably see and remove each bolt from the converter as it turns
round with the crank. problem is as i said i can't turn the crank at
all. what other alternatives do i have to geting the engine removed? is
it possible to do it without removeing the egine and trans as a whole?
cause i would really rather not do that. The engine only seems to be
connected to the trans, but maybe i'm forgting to disconnect something
else?

thanks for your time
