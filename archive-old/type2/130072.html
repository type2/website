Subject: Re: Windshield For a `71 bus

&gt;From: Jules Herr &lt;jules.herr_at_gmail_dot_com&gt;
&gt;I just bought my first bus, a 1971 camper, after a long love
&gt;unrequited affair with the vehicles. In addition to getting the engine
&gt;back up and running again I need to replace the front windshield.
&gt;My question is:
&gt;What model year bus windsheilds will fit my vehicle? This would be
&gt;helpful when calling around to junkyards.

Unless you are seriously, seriously stressed for cash, don't bother with a 
junkyard windshield. It will prob. be foggy around the edges, may have a 
clean edge for making a new good seal and you will have a hard time getting 
it out, then in without stressing it.

I just called Safelite and they sent someone around to install a new one. 
It was like $150 plus $50 for the seal. They would use my seal as long as 
it was new and of good quality, so you can save a few bucks if you get a 
Bus Depot seal for like $15. But call Safelite to make sure they will let 
you use another seal. Even if they don't the $200 is money well spent. They 
had to install mine 5 times and used three seals and two windshields before 
they could stop the leak. But they did and they did it for free each time 
until it stopped leaking. The last time they did it the guy had me come in 
on a Saturday afternoon when they were closed and he spent about 4 hours 
working on it. He ended up having to use a belt sander to adjust the 
perimeter of the windshield and some funky stuff on the edge of the seal to 
get it to bond cleanly with the paint. All for about the same cost as a 
windshield plain. And you can pick from clear or partial tint.
