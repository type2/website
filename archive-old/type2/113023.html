Subject: Stock dual carb setup.

Perhaps I wasn't totally clear during my first post. Repair parts for 
the stock dual carbs for a 72 are rare at the least.. My question was 
about alternatives and what others have tried. I'm trying to get a 
consensus as to where to head with my bus. I'm tired of asking questions 
and having the canned &quot;man, 72 carbs are so hard to take care of blah 
blah blah&quot; answer thrown in my face. Should I go FI? How much does it 
cost? Should I go dual  {weber|dellorto|kadron} in it's place? Come on  
lets do some talking here! :-)
