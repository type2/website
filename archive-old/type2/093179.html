&gt;A straight weight synthetic had actually been on wish lists for a

&gt;i attended on new merchandise for the flaps iworked at that time.  The 
&gt;vendor rep from mobile stated that strange as seemed that there actually 
&gt;were some difficulties in blending a straight weight in synthetics.  Looks 
&gt;like the hurdle has been beaten.

I wish it were true.  I couldn't find any reference to a straight-weight 
synthetic on Mobil's web site, so I called them up and asked.  The person I 
talked to said he knew nothing about a straight 30-weight oil.  Here are 
the only weights listed on www.mobil1_dot_com:

0W-40
0W-30
5W-30
10W-30
15W-50

He did say they were working on a 5W-20 oil.
