&gt;When I am driving my 71 cold and I push in the clutch to come to a stop, the
&gt;motor will die.  If I am coming to a stop and I push in the clutch and then
&gt;blip the gas, it will not die.  Is there something wrong with my idle
&gt;circuit or what?  I could not find any useful information in the archives.

Look first for a vacuum leak. That can be at the worn throttle shaft and/or
the vacuum advance or hose thereto. See posts by Isaiah and Orange for
other sources.

Then you must verify timing, idle and mixture. Then set the choke properly.
Also make sure the throttle plate is adjusted properly.
