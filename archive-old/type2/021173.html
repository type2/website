&gt; I wanted to share my experience with Freeze 12 refrigerant as a replacement
&gt; for R-12.  OBC:  If Freeze 12 works as well as I think it does, I am going to
&gt; strongly
&gt; consider dumping the 134a from the A/C in the bus and replacing it with
&gt; Freeze 12.  I have ester oil in the bus but Freeze 12 is compatable with it
&gt; - in fact, they recommend it if you need to add oil to the system.

David:
Nice to know. I've changed both 87 Vanagons to 134, but have heard bad things
about it. No problems so far for me, but it's only been a year.
I might have mentioned earlier that I have the complete VPC system that was in
my 78 (I put it in in 84). (I have every piece, including the instructions,
templates and warranty cards.) I removed every piece when I junked the vehicle
in 1998. I would like to use it someday, but not sure which form. I have a 72
hardtop Westy that would be the  logical choice. So, what I need is the
westy-type evaporator- fan assembly, or under dash, (but that seems scary).
If you know where there is such a part, I'd be interested.
