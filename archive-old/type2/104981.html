Subject: Re: [T2] Pep Boys &amp; fuses

Pep Boys:
i bought 5 brand new tires from them (thinking that if they are a
national chain, i can get help if i get a flat away from home)... first,
it nearly took an act of congress to get help, then i found out later
that i had gotten one 205 and 4 195s... then i discovered after that,
that i had 2 short valve stems, 2 long ones and i dont know what the
spare is cuz it mounts backwards on the front, so i cant see it. i am
beginning to have second thoughts about getting my tires there... oh, i
took the 205 back and they installed a 195 no charge, BTW.

Fuses:
haven't had to buy any for the bus yet, but when i was driving my 65
beetle, i didnt seem to have any trouble finding fuses at my flaps,
although sometimes the clerk didnt know they even had them. i lucked out
once... my parents used to have a dasher wagon (or is that wagen?) and
long after they sold it, my mom found some fuses still plastic wrapped
and stuck to the card it came on.

and it even has a price tag from WHITLOCK for $1.19!!!
there are 5 red and 5 white fuses in here

i am a little confused, though. it says an assortment of eight 8amp and 4
16amp, but like i said, there are only 8 total... weird. i can scan this,
too, if anyone is interested. i just think it's neat to have NOS, even if
it is just late 70s, early 80s... then again, i'm just a silly girl,
right?

wavin, not wanting to open my &quot;NOS&quot; fuses,
