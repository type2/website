Subject: Re: '68 Konbi hesitation

&gt; what carb??
&gt;The boston engine line is for 34pict3. Hesitation only for the last 4 
months
&gt;but before that was OK?? I have 1600DP 009 34 pict and experience the
&gt;hesitation every day but it is more like a lull or dull spot when
&gt;transitioning from idle to throttle. Im used to it no a big deal. This
&gt;doesnt sound like your prob. are you sure a bout the TDC mark?? I would
&gt;verify that it is _at_ tdc (pull sparkplug, put stick or screwdriver in 
hole to
&gt;feel piston, turn by hand, verify tdc mark it at top of piston travel) 
10
&gt;deg w 009 should be right.

the carb. it a 30.
The hesitation has been going on for about 4 months.  When i got the 
engine it was OK.  When I adjust the carb. sometimes the hesitation gets 
a little better and sometimes a little worse, but I can't get rid of it.  
The only way I got 95% rid of it was to go with 10 BTDC, but then I got 
(what I think) is an overworking engine at 45-50MPH.  I used to have a 
similar problem when I had my beetle, but I did the same thing you do 
just deal with it.  But it is a little more noticeable in the Bus.
