Subject: Garage worries


&gt;I am this weekend taking the van into the garage, a specialist aircooled
&gt;place that maintains all the buses that are used by the Australians, New
&gt;Zealanders and South Africans that use Britain as their home base for
&gt;travelling around the continent.

&gt;It just worries me that the guy will find something to fix whether it
really
&gt;needs it or not and I may end up paying a high price for peace of mind and
&gt;no really desperate mechanical maintenance.

&gt;I know that this isn't a very easy subject to help me with but I was
&gt;wondering whether the huge experience of the listees could give me any
hints
&gt;of how not to be caught out.
