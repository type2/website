Subject: Stereo Wiring

Volks;
My ever-bus-patient wife bought me a nice stereo for my birthday to put
in my bus.  Since the bus has no accessory position for the key switch,
is there a way to wire it to the ignition with out leaving the key
on(don't want to burn that coil).  I was thinking there should be some
way to wire it to the on position for the key, for normal operation, and
with a switch for listening while the key is off, camping.  My current
radio is hot wired, and it's kind of a pain to turn it off and on all
the time, especially around town.

Any hints?

thanks
