Subject: &quot;Balanced Engine&quot; Rebuild

I am in the final staged of rebuilding my 72 westy.  I have been
following much of the advice from the sermons in an attempt to get a
better than stock rebuild.  I have balanced the rods and pistons to
within 1/2 g.  I am now in the process of setting my compression ratio.

As the engine stands now if I assembly with my shims I'll get Compresion
Ratios of 7.03,7.19,7.20,7.02.  Talking to several shops as to weather
this is close enought they all seem to think so.  However, from reading
the sermons, Bob seems to go through great length to &quot;exactly&quot; balance
the combustion chambers.  In the attempt to get a better than &quot;stock&quot;
rebuild, which is my goal.  Which may not be the goal of the shops I
have spoken to.  If I work the heads (add 2cc's to 2 of the head
chambers) I can get CR's to 7.22,7.20,7.21,7.21.  Is this the type of
balance Bob is talking about.  

Has anyone out there had experience in this area and know the difference
or know the work associated with working the heads.  I attempeted to buy
the book &quot;How to Hot Rod a VW engine&quot;, which apparently discusses this,
but locally it was sold out.  Also if I do attempt to rework the heads
where do you remove the metal from?

Any advice, suggestion or comments would be appreciated

Thanks
Brent
