Subject: Dead Battery Blues, part 2

First of all, thanks to everyone for their kind support and suggestions. My
especial thanks to Terry &amp; Sunshine, and Thom for their words of cheer.
Anyway, this is where we are at with our 75 bus.

Something unknown has been draining the battery. My regular mechanic cannot
find anything, so I'm thinking that it may be (as suggested by my elders
here) that all the connections are just old and I'm losing power all over
the place. I don't know this for sure, but the electrical has been given a
pretty good look-see and nothing is now apparent (once by your basic Joe
Mechanic, once by a guy with some VW years behind him).

I have been advised to take the bus to St. Paul, MN to the Old Volks Home
for a diagnostic and potential fix. The Diagnostic (not just electrical, but
the whole she-bang) will be $100. I am not qualified to do this myself (but
I am willing to learn).

Has anyone heard of the Old Volks Home, for better or worse? Is $100 a fair
price to look my baby over (as you can tell by that remark, I'm very
attached, so ultimately, I know I will pay it, if I must)?

I am determined to get myself into shape (mechanically, speaking), as well
as my bus, and get her out there on the road. In fact, sign me up for the
next Inuvik!

 Stout-heartedly,

wendy
