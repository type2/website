&gt;in my 74 Westy, I just noticed today that the gas pedal appears not right.
&gt; It appears that it is just connected at the bottom right and the bottom
&gt;left appears just loose.  As a consequence, the gas pedal leans to the
&gt;left, almost underneath the brake pedal.
&gt;
&gt;Is there some sort of bracket that holds the gas pedal at the bottom?  How
&gt;do I go about hooking it back up and returning it to normal?

There should be a bracket welded to the floor and a pin that holds the pedal to the bracket.
