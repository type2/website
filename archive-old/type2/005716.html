Subject: Re: [T2] front Westfalia plaid bench seat???


[...]


&gt; I have a quick question. Did the bay window Westfalias
&gt; ever have a front bench seat?

The only bay window Westfalias I have seen with 1/3, 2/3 front seats were
early....before 73. The 2/3 seat hinges in the middle. Does not have a solid
frame like 67 and back.

&gt;If so, was it the same
&gt; vinyl seat that was used in the standard bus models or
&gt; was it ever made with any of the plaid fabric that the
&gt; westfalia bucket seats were made of?

The plaid did not start til 74. Early bays used basket weave. 68 to 72 Westy
used honey vinyl. 73 Westy was gold cloth.

&gt; If their is such
&gt; a thing as a plaid Westy front bench seat, does
&gt; anyone have pictures? Thanks!
