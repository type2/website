Subject: Engine is in!
X-Diagnostic: MESSAGE MAY NOT BE TOPICAL

After several months, my engine is finally in! I still have to make the 
connections and put the rear tin on, but it is IN!! My lovely and talented 
fiancee helped me (I think I'll keep her) and we finished just before it 
started to rain. Took about an hour and a half including putting a piece of 
tin on that I discovered I had forgotten. Pretty uneventful, really. And no 
wasp stings this time, either.
