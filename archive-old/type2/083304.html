Subject: Re: [T2] Electrical Genius has a question....

Troy,
	Here is not what I have already done, but what I plan on doing.
Since there are several accessories I might like to add later I
started thinking that the way to do it is to buy an additional fuse
block. Mount it under the dash &amp; run all accessories off it. I am not
sure if I will run a larger wire back to the engine or just take off
one unused terminal on my fuse block. But on my fuse block there was
one unused fuse/terminal. I used this to connect my CB &amp; Radio. To get
to the terminals unhook the batter &amp; then unscrew the 2 (i think)
screws holding the fuse block on the metal. There was one of mine
which had nothing comming off the top end. I used a spade connector to
get power +12v off this. &amp; used the existing ground on the frame for
the ground side of my electronics. Hope this helps.

&gt; Hello all,
&gt;             I got a CB radio today.  After EB I knew I should get one.
&gt; My buddy gave me his old one.  So I am home now, and the electrical
&gt; genious in me has a question.  How in the world do I hook it up?  A lot
&gt; of people said the splice a line off the cigarette lighter.  Well, I
&gt; aint got one a dem darn things!!  I have no electrical experience at all
&gt; and am not even quite sure what I need.  I do have a package that has
&gt; connectors and a crimper and stuff.  Any guidance for the mentally
&gt; challenged?  Thanks
