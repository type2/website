If you are really interested in knowing your 'exact' oil pressure, buy an
aircraft gauge and sender, not a cheep VDO unit. Aircraft Spruce and Specialty
Co. has the Stewart-Warner units for $300.00+ in their catalog, and these units
put out a 'guaranteed' indication(+-.2%!) alla time!  Now Thats accuracy!

My .02 1/2.

Chris.
