Subject: Re: [T2] windsheild installation

What Jeff failed to mention, What he does is perfect! HE is big and strong,, his
wife is small and smart... big strong guy [ew ew ew ,Tim Taylor voice?&gt; on the
outside putting the windshield in,, and positioning it a bit,, and a nice &lt;good
looking too, sucking up voice?&gt; gentle touch on the cord, pulling the rubber &lt;SEAL!
I am talking about a SEAL thilly!&gt; in place,
Then as the job gets closer to breaking the windshield,, the outside pounder has to
get a lot more gentle, and the inside puller has to be a little stronger.

&gt; I've done this more times than I care to think about. I've never used soap,
&gt; but have always used powder to help the seal slide in place.  My wife is
&gt; my (perfect)  helper for doing windshields/glass. She is on the inside of
&gt; the bus pulling the cord while I'm on the outside pushing on the glass. As you
&gt; get the windshield about 3/4 way seated it does get pretty hard pulling the
&gt; cord out-this is when we switch,and I start pulling the cord and she pushes on
&gt; the glass.
