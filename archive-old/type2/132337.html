Subject: Re: [T2] upgrading to 73+ brakes?

Maybe true.  I did read that or was told or something, but I could not
convince myself that was the case.  I think that I have the originals, but
maybe not.  I measured both, I think, and they were the same.  But who knows
what any particular bus actually has on it.

&gt; I think that you have to change the spindles as well.  Be sure before you
&gt; take the plunge!
