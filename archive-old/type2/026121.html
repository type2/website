Subject: Valve train wear - what is &quot;normal&quot;?

I just adjusted my valves for the second time ever.  I could not glean any
useful information from this process the first time around because I don't
know when the PO last adjusted anything.
I set them all to 0.006&quot; the first time.  This time (after 2500 miles) they
were all around 0.008&quot;.  What I would like to know is, is this a normal wear
rate?  (BTW this is a type 4, 2 litre engine, obviously with solid lifters.)
I could not find this information in any of the books I have or in the
archives, only references to tight valves.  Should I be relaxing or
worrying?
