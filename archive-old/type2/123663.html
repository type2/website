&gt;&gt; I then checked the entire wireharness and AFM as per the Bentley
&gt;&gt; manual with no faults found...the only exception was I didn't check
&gt;&gt; the fuel regulator because the van runs fine once warm and has no
&gt;&gt; problem starting.

&gt; It's kind of a long-shot and, at a *guess*, it's not relevant to
&gt; your problem, but I'd still check the fuel pressure. Go down to your
&gt; local Ace Hardware and get a water pressure gauge that reads up to
&gt; 45 lbs. Get a brass hose barb that screws on to the gauge with a
&gt; 1/4&quot; barb. Get a length of FI hose and a couple of hose clamps. For
&gt; $15 - $20 you're in business and can ensure that fuel pressure
&gt; *isn't* the problem. It's one of those &quot;tools&quot; you use once every
&gt; year or two and the price is right.

Yeah, I guess eliminating that is something I'll have to do.
