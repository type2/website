Well, folks have left the type 2 list citing being hassled by other list
members.  I don't really see it, though.  I think that some folks just
don't &quot;suffer fools gladly&quot; and take it upon themselves to leave.  If that
person happens to be a good contributor, the list suffer a loss.
Unfortunately, if there are personalities involved, occasional dissonance
is unavoidable.

I also moderate a Scion forum, and this group is a bunch of rabbis
compared to the free-for-all there.  :)
