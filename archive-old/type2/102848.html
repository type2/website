&gt; I've already combed

&gt; knows of any documentation as far a manuals and instruction books that are out
&gt; there for these things.

There is a lot of info there, did you see this?

&gt; Also, how can you tell if the fridge runs on propane or not.

Electrical. You are thinking of the Vanagon fridge.

&gt; I have gotten it to turn
&gt; on with battery power but I don't know if it even is the propane model.  I
&gt; think I have most things on the bus figured out but I would love to hear some
&gt; advice from those who have dealt with all of these things before.
