Subject: Tranny rebuilder

I'm looking for a source to service my tranny. I would hate to install this
back into my &quot;64 
Delux after I restore the entire bottom of it to find it has troubles. Any
one who can help drop me a line I'll be stating this resto this winter and
will drop off anywhere in the New York region of the States. Also cauld use a
set of aluminum rocker moldings in restorable condition.
