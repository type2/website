&gt; when the engine is running and the valve cover is off, there is  oil

&gt; 
&gt; will have to let you know about that.  There is definitely  oil being pumped 
&gt; 
&gt; through the head though.

hello jeremy  each push rod and each rocker should have oil pumped thur them. 
if not then the rocker and valve stem will be starved of oil and make noise. 
Try this take the valve cover off and syart the bus have something under it to 
catch the oil that will come out and spray some lubacant like wd 40 around 
the valve that is making the noise ande see what effect it has, This will tell 
you if you have an oil problem or if it is the valve guide or spring.  It 
coulsd also be a cracked spring.  later and have fun  Mark Dearing
