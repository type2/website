Subject: hard to get clean in hard water..

I finally gave my bus a much needed wash tonight. No wonder she seems slow,
she's got an extra 40 lbs. of hard water deposits on her!!  Can anyone
recommend a god wax or polish to remove this crap. Elbow grease and Turtle wax
didn't cut it. Hopefully whatever is suggested won't cost me an arm and a
leg...hint hint.

Thanks
