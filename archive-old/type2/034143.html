Subject: VW in Galax Va.

I was traveling in the western part of Virginia this past weekend and
spotted a Westy with vines growing over it, sitting in front of an old
building.  Not sure what year it was, but it has the backup light/taillight
setup that my '71 has.  The place was closed so I did not stop, but it
has haunted me since then that a nice Westy is sitting there starting
to rust away.  Anyone close to Galax, Virginia?  If so p-mail me and I
will give you the location.  It sure looked like it could be rehalibated
and put back on the road.
