Subject: Re: [T2] Darn VDO Metric vs. NPT

&gt; I hooked up my mechanical oil pressure gauge today but I couldn't get my VDO

&gt; 
&gt; I read all the prior threads on this subject and I thought I understood it
&gt; but after ordering items apparently I do not. I thought my case had the
&gt; M10x1mm hole as was agreed upon but Hoover says it's 1/8&quot;-27 NPT. The sender
&gt; I pulled out was stamped 1/78 and my bus was built in 2/78 so it's probably
&gt; the original and was removed for the first time.
&gt; 
&gt; I know with 100% certainty that the FI temp sensor is M10x1 and it won't
&gt; thread into the hole. I have a tee adapter for a bug that has female M10x1
&gt; threads and neither the stock sender nor the VDO dual pole sender wants to
&gt; thread into it properly so why is it advertized as M10x1 (?3).
&gt; 
&gt; This is all what I have:

&gt; http://homepage.mac_dot_com/ratwell/.Pictures/Maintenance3/242-OilPressThreads.j
&gt; pg
&gt; 
&gt; What I can't figure out is the threads of hose labeled (?1). It's the same
&gt; on each end and I can identify the other thread as an AN fitting.
&gt; 
&gt; Has anyone else had this problem and identified these threads? VDO's tech
&gt; support was inept at best and now everything is closed for the holiday.
&gt; There only seen to be two threads advertized but they're all different
&gt; enough I can make them fit nicely. Is there something basic I just don't
&gt; understand?


Richard,

First off, you need a thread gauge. They come in metric and inch and they
are not expensive, a good tool to have. You also need a caliper or
micrometer to measure the diameter of the thread, then you can identify any
thread.

The VDO pressure sender is m10x1.0 tapered. The stock sender is m10
straight, all of the original switches I have seen also have an aluminum
crush ring underneath, which is only needed with a straight thread. The
stock switch bottoms on the case while a tapered one will not unless you
over tighten it. I am not sure why the VDO senders are tapered threads when
the VW cases are straight threads, but that is how they are. The head temp
sender is straight as well. I think what is making this confusing is not
only the distinction between metric and inch threads, but also straight and
tapered. There are no tapered threads used on the VW case anywhere. This is
surely because the case materials crack easily - VW used straight threads
and sealing rings to prevent this from occurring.

I don't believe the VW case is ever 1/8-27&quot; NPT unless someone has done this
to it after it left the factory - the oil pressure switches are m10x1.0
straight. 1/8-27 is very close to m10, so close that those two thread sizes
will &quot;go into&quot; each other, but some sort of damage or distortion of the
threads may result, depending on the materials of the parts. For example,
many VW cases may now appear to be 1/8-27 due to having a switch installed
into the case of this thread size. The switch is steel, the case is aluminum
or magnesium, the case will deform to the switch threads quite easily. The
m10 x1.0 tapered threads of the VDO senders also deform the case threads,
but to a lesser degree, as they are the same pitch as the case. I don't know
the torque on the sender, but with the vdo tapered one I would use about 10
ft-lbs. 

Bear in mind that an oil pressure switch I san item found on every vehicle,
and a great many of them look identical to each other. On an old motor one
might find almost any oil pressure switch there, it could be the original
one or a replacement part. There are literally hundreds of these parts made
that all look the same at a glance. If it is a tapered one, it is not
original, I say this because I have dismantled quite a few motors known to
be untouched since the factory and they all had straight threads on the oil
switches.

The new VDO oil pressure hose seems to be a 1/8-27 hose with two adapters to
make it m10x1.0 tapered on both ends (one male, one female). The old VDO
hose had metric threads and no adapters.

If you want to use a mechanical gauge for startup pressure measurement, the
best way I have found to do it is to get an instant fitting nipple from a
hydraulic supply:

http://www.cs.fiu_dot_edu/~jstric01/images/VW/vw_type_iv_air_cooled_2.htm

Instant fittings do not come in metric that I have found (though metric ones
surely are used in Europe), but you can get brake pipe unions that adapts
1/8-27 to m10 at any auto parts store. Thread the quick nipple into the hole
and the nylon hose just slips in and out. Very slick, doesn't leak, and easy
to remove once you are done with it.
