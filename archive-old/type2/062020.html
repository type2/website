Subject: where not to go to get your front end alignment.

Since I recently put new tie rod ends in my bus, it needed to have the
toe-in set. Yesterday (saturday) I drove around town looking for
places that were open. I stopped by an auto parts store I'd been to
several times that had an alignment bay, Western Auto. When I went in,
I was told that they were booked through the end of the day, but they
had a bay open at 11:00 sunday. So rather than go look for another
place, I decided to go ahead and do that. Well, when I went there this
morning, I was informed the technician couldn't work on my car because
&quot;he didn't have the tools&quot;. I explained the tools necessary were 2
14mm box ends, a wrench to turn the adjustable tie rod, and an
alignment rig. The counter droid went and got the &quot;general manager&quot;
who said that &quot;every time we try to align an old bug something
breaks&quot;. I pointed out the reason I needed an alignment was because I
had new tie rod ends, and I had thus just undone the clamp bolts and
put in new tie rod ends, and tightened the clamp bolts, and that I
knew everything would turn freely and no breakage would occur. Then he
informed me that &quot;they just don't line well,&quot; and that's why they
didn't do alignments on VW's, Renaults, or BMWs.

I wouldn't have minded this so much, except the fact that they took an
appointment for one day, and made me come back before turning me down,
on a day where I couldn't get it done anywhere else, and then gave me
this chickenshit &quot;we don't have the tools&quot; excuse from the &quot;front end
technician&quot;.

I won't be going back there...

It's annoying to have to pay someone $40 to adjust toe-in anyway, I
need to invest in a rig to do it myself.
