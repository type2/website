&gt;You mention you got stuff from &quot;Bill and Steve's.&quot;  To whom are you
&gt;referring?  They seem to be the best bet...

&gt;Thanks,
&gt;Eric

Eric,

Ah... customer service in the form of hones advice piques your interest. 
Caveat number one: The last time I delt with them was in Jan. '93. I don't even
know for a fact that they're still in the biz.
Caveat number two: Their specialty is not vans. But they do carry some parts for
them. Or did.
Caveat number three: Uh..... lost my train of thought. Getting dinner for your
kids will do that. (I guess I'm not too seriously addicted to this list  ;-)
Oh... there's a 20% restocking fee :-&lt;

Good things. Their price on the door seals was less than half of the next lowest
price (German and Brazilian). When I bought them, they were $37.95 and $14.95
respectively (Yes, that's right, $37.95 for German front door seals for a '72
TII). 

That said, here's their last known address:

Bill and Steve's Foreign Auto
10464 Alondra Blvd.
Bellflower, CA 90706

Voice:  310.866.9045

Good Luck, Eric!   
I'll call them tomorrow and warn them that their address has been posted. Power
of the 'net, y'know.
BTW, I've no connection with Bill and Steve's. Caveat Emptor?
