Subject: steering box and horn replacemnt doings

Replaced the steering box recently; while there, figured I'd
A) replace the big rubber square that connects the box to the steering
column and
B) redo the horn wire, which has been a button-on-the-dash hack for some
time now...

TWO THINGS TO REMEMBER - VERY IMPORTANT!

One,  replace that rubber 'bushing' when you do any work to the steering
column that looks likely to give you the chance. They don't break very
often, but break they do, and byebye steering. Especially if you are
replacing the steering box, there is no reason NOT to spend the $10 or so
bucks here... plus, you will likely never have to do this again for as long
as you own the bus.

Two, in a 68-70 bus, the electrical circuit for the horn is as follows: the
hot wire (yellow and black) comes from the brake switch line or somewhere
straight from the fuse block (depending on year), goes to one terminal on
the horn - have been told that some horns prefer one terminal over the
other to be hot - and the wire on the other terminal (brown) connects to a
spade lug  on the underside of the steering column, under the bus. You can
just see it, above the steering box, in the front (FIF). There also is a
rubber  grommet  in this area that insulates the column from the rest of
the car, don't worry about it now; the gist of this is that the column is
now &quot;seeking&quot; ground, but is isolated.
The horn button is the key - underneath the button is a ring of tin or
something; below is another ring, this one of copper. When you push the
horn button, you are pressing these two together momentarily and BEEEEP
because  attached to that FIRST ring is a wire, the notorious 'horn won't
shut off' wire.  This travels down the center of the hollow steering shaft
(itself travelling down the center of the hollow steering &gt;column&lt;) and
connects  to the bolts that hold that little rubber bushing twixt box and
column. Convoluted, no? It gets worse.

PAY ATTENTION AND SAVE YERSELF TWO DAYS OF LYING UNDER YOUR BUS REDOING
STUFF! AMHIK!

That wire from the horn button, which travels down the steering shaft, MUST
be attached to the bolts on the STEERING BOX side of that big rubber
bushing - this bushing is basically what isolates the steering schmeck from
the rest of the car; when you push the horn button, you are completing the
ground circuit thru the bolt and then thru the steering box to the frame.
If you connect that wire to the steering COLUMN side, it ain't gonna work.
Bentley does not tell you this. Muir does not tell you this. Archives
didn't mention it. Bob Hoover didn't know. Clymer, Chilton, nope. Which is
silly, coz its the most import thing here.

When your horn won't shut off, its because that wire is grounding to the
shaft somewhere. Which is analogous to connecting the wire to the wrong
side of that bushing!

Now, tighten up all those nuts, put in new cotter pins and rejoice in tight
steering and/or loud horniness!
