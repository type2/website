Subject: The lights where out!

Volks, Just thought I would share this story.  Back in November I was
driving home from WV after an intense kayaking trip.  It 4:30 am and the
headlights turn off and then
on again.  Strange I think.  December, driving to Phish concert, delayed
1/2 hour because I can't get my headlights to work.  One week later I am
on my way to a
Disco Biscuits concert in Phili and the lights still don't work.  I'm a
slow learner.  I decide to either remove the fuse box on my 80 westy to
find the culprit, or only
drive during the day.  I drop the box and suddenly I leave the darkness
and entire the exciting world of light.  I left the fuse box hanging for
the last three months.
Well my inspection is due.  I'm not sure, but I think a hanging fuse box
is not a good idea.

So, last night I begin to rewire the entire fuse box searching for the
short that has plagued my night vision.  I trace each wire . . .
Suddenly I find this odd circular thing
mounted to the frame.  Each and every wire connected is a brown ground
wire.  I jiggle the fuse box, and see a scary sight.  Sparks begin to
fly throughout the dash.

Moral of the story:  The PO told me she had trouble with a windshield
leak.  Water had settled on this shelf and caused corrosion of this
ground.  I took my trusty
wire toothbrush and cleaned the entire area, all connection terminals,
and inspected all wires.  I may use some anti-corrosion lubricant, like
the stuff you put on your
battery terminals.  My hanging fuse box was pulling just hard enough to
get a connection.  I'm just thankful I did not have a fire!  Check your
connections regularly.

80 Westy
