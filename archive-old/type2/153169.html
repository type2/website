Subject: Re: [VB] oil coolers, heat and etc

...

&gt;
&gt;My criteria to him for this bus engine was &quot;BOMBPROOF&quot; engine for long road
&gt;trips to shows, etc.

this was my rationale as well - i originally purchased the aluminum 
case block because the bearing webs wouldn't twist or pound with 
excessive heat or miles. plus, you could weld up any damage and start 
over! sadly, the way they make these cases is DIFFERENT than the vw 
aluminum type 1 cases of the early 70s (europe only). so they are 
crapola, IMH(but WELL researched)O.

&gt;  It runs well around town &amp; has great torque on
&gt;hills-can go over 7000 ft elev. passes in 4th gear which I was in 2nd or 2rd
&gt;on before, but does get to 230 + when driving over 55 mph for over 15-20
&gt;minutes in warm, dry weather. I have 6000 miles on the engine ($2800) &amp; need
&gt;for it to last.

that sounds almost exactly like my specs except for the heating. my 
oil temps tend to be 180 in town after some time, go straight to 220 
on the highway and stay there if i stay at 60 or so. they will hit 
230 if i go faster. part of that is 115 degree 3% humidity phoenix; 
some is due to my LOW compression ratio - i am using less of the bang 
available in the gas, and the motor spins more  ( works harder) to 
acheive the extra speed. some is due to case heat retention, which 
signifcantly slows  oil cooling via the case  compared to stock :P 
i've considered bumping CR up to 7.2 or so for fun.

sadly, your price tag is also in line with mine  X(

oh, i'm using a mild schneider cam - mainly slightly longer duration 
to suck a bit more air into the 90mm machine-in pistons. a stump 
puller more than a highway cut, so falls off after 4000 or so 
anyways. 60 mph is fine by me. just wish it was for the 80+ crowd 
here in PHX.



&gt;But I am questioning the wisdom of this engine in a DC w/ tilt  &amp; roof rack
&gt;also!

  lowering the CR is fairly easy - take off the cylinders, and put in 
the appropriate spacers. i use the berg blanchard ground ones, but 
others claim the scat ones are fine. there is a CR  and  spacer 
calculator on T2_dot_com under ness-tek. CC yer heads, add cylinder sizes 
and viola: it gives the size spacer needed for desired CR.

THEN you get to screw around with valve geometry, which is my next 
kettle of worms :P
