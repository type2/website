Subject: Re: [T2] Vanagon seats - Erdman Avenue Maryland


They sell for $25 - $35 for each front seat, but the back seats should go 
for just $25 each.

The price list has bucket seats at $15, plus $5 for the tracks (the seat 
tracks are needed; they are built in on the bus seats) and $25 for captains 
seats (these have arms on them), also plus $5 for the tracks.

Theoretically, the pair of frontcaptain chairs/seats should go for $60.

There are TWO BLACK VINYL vanagon front bucket seats at another junk yard.  
They are also nice, and for $15+$5, they are a bargin, too

&gt;
&gt;What do Vanagon seats sell for?
&gt;
&gt;I've been working (very slowlyA) on converting GTI seats and let me tell
&gt;you I'm not sure that it will work.
&gt;
&gt;Either way it's a PITA.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;&gt;There is/was a tan/brown '87 vanagon with EXCELLENT seats!!
&gt;
&gt;Ciao!
