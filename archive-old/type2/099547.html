Subject: Re: [T2] More power out of 2L FI

&gt;Well I picked up the 79 westy with auto trans that I posted about last week.
&gt;I'm both happy and surprised by its performance, had been planning to build
&gt;a bigger motor but have since changed my mind as it works well as is.


Modern fuel injection with a better flowing intake. Check out TMW induction 
and Megasquirt.

Also you could fit a modern VW or GM or whoever you want.

There is a list member that put CIS injection (VW mechanical injection from 
the 80's) on his bus engine and had positive results in the power and 
mileage departments.
