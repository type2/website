Subject: Re: [T2] Book Timing or Mechanics Advice Timing????

&gt;Your mechanic is smoking crack... and you're
engine will soon be smoking, too.

Why?  Are you suggesting this is too much
advance?  Only if he's running a 009 or 050 that
cannot compensate for different amounts of
vacuum.  

&gt;Time your distributor according to what MODEL
ENGINE you have, not the distributor.  However,
if you've got an aftermarket distributor, you
probably want your total max advance to go no
higher than what a stock distributor on that
engine would time to.  make sense?

10deg ATDC (-10) Vacuum: 7-12deg Adv, 16-18deg
Ret; Centrifugal: 21-25deg _at_ 3400 rpm = 34 - 45
BTDC max advance.  38 is relatively conservative
for a dual vacuum advance dizzy.
