Subject: Re: [T2] 1971 Westfalia

Fantastic! Buy it. You'll hate yourself later if you
don't. Then, talk to Jake Raby about a 1678cc that he
has created specifically for buses. I've driven one,
and am currently building one for my '71 Bus. In my
humble opinion, you've got the best year for a
bay-window. Still the T1 engine and the earlier
styling, but with the key factor of front disc brakes.


Good luck, 
John Cloonan

&gt; Hello All,
&gt; Anyone there? I am new and green as grass in the
&gt; spring on this list. I 
&gt; found a 1971 Westy in Washington state for 3000
&gt; dollars. Motor is a fresh 
&gt; rebuilt and the unit is complete and rust free. I
&gt; camped in it for a few 
&gt; days and fell in love. Now I want to buy. Should I? 
&gt; Would like to tow my 
&gt; BMW motorcycle and the 1600 motor sure is no
&gt; powerhouse. The interior is 
&gt; good and complete but the canvas is going south.
&gt; Tires are fair. Paint is 
&gt; fresh. The mechanic is a personal friend and been in
&gt; the business for 20 
&gt; years. The deal includes redone front seats and a
&gt; bumper hitch. I want to 
&gt; buy.  Stop me now or put up with me in the future. 
&gt; Thank you,  Bill 
&gt; Shockley, Tomahawk, WI.
