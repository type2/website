Subject: Re: [T2] Gas Smell 


I had gas fumes with &gt; 1/2 tank of gas.    Turned out it was the o-ring on
the gas gauge sender.  According to the book you have to pull the engine &amp;
tank, but my PO had used a cold chisel (or something) to cut a small access
plate just forward of top engine access door ( '72? ).  This was sealed up
with duct-tape, so I was able to quickly get to the sender, replace the
O-ring, and seal it back up. You might look at this if there are no
externaly visible leaks.  Obviously be careful cutting if you have gas fumes
present. :0
