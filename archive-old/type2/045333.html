Subject: [T2] WTB/Need Info: BA6 Relay

I'm missing the relay that goes under the dash for a BA6. As I have been
for about a year, I'm fuzzy on the details of which part it is I'm missing,
but if you know BA6's, you can probably figure it out for me.

For historical perspective, I picked up this BA6 about a year ago for a
good price. It was supposed to be complete, but upon comparison to the
charts on the Type2 site, I'm missing the one relay that's labeled on the
wiring diagram as &quot;Heater relay with ballast resistor for air circulation
blower.&quot; I haven't tried to install it yet, but I've saved a bunch of
e-mails with tips and I *do* have a mig welder. I'll fabricate mounts on
the bus and have someone else help me fabricate some exhaust and ducting.

Ron (Bus Depot) sent me a note some time back that he sold the &quot;triple
relay&quot; (part # 411 963 209B) for $60. He also has one labeled &quot;main relay&quot;
(part # 211 963 135), but that's $175 (yowsa!). I honestly don't know which
part number I'm looking for.

Any help will be appreciated. And for those of you who get to go junking,
I'd love it if you would be on the prowl for one or both of these for me.
Any bus that looks like it once had the heater will be a candidate.

Thanks! Joe (hoping to install heater this fall)
