Well I am not positive about the wiring of those radios, but I have worked
with a lot of new systems.  I can say that I have never seen an inline
fuse in the ground wire so the black wire is probably your positive.  The
blue wire is most likely your negative because it would very hard to
ground the radio through the outer shell.  I know that in new systems the
blue wire is for a remote connection like an amplifier but I doubt if they
had those back then.  It only makes sense that you would have a positive a
negative and speaker wires.  However you said you had 2 speaker wires,
does this mean you have two sets?  Your speakers need 2 wires a piece, it
is possible that there are 2 positive speaker wires and they share a
negative.  Then you are left with no negative for the system in which case
I guess it must ground through the shell.  Sorry if this was of no help.
