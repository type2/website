&gt; Well The time has come for me to put a new 1600 dp in my 71 westy
and I 
&gt; was wondering if anyone ahd suggestions for a quality company to
order 
&gt; from.  Because of the price factor I have decided to buy a rebuilt 
&gt; longblock as opposed to a new one.  Some of the companies I am 
&gt; considering are;  Strictly Foregin, Moffoco, Barrett enterprises,
GEX, 
&gt; Quality German Auto Parts, Rogers European Engineering, eliete
Foregin 
&gt; Auto, and Chirco.  Does anyone have ANY experience with any of these, 
&gt; good or bad.  I am planning on ordering in the next week so let me
know.

If it were my money, you cannot beat the deal from Beetlemex.  $980
for a new engine!  It'd be hard to buy the parts for a quality rebuild
for this amount!

You might save a couple of hundred by buying a rebuilt, but the
economics say that the rebuilt won't be nearly as good.
