I did the same with an email and my prepaid (3 years ago) arrive last
week. I haven't ordered any parts yet as I am now awaiting their
forthcoming &quot;updated price list&quot; due in a few weeks.

&gt; You say it's listed in your catalog. I'd really like to see it as I paid for
&gt; my catalog about three years ago and have yet to receive it. Are they out
&gt; now? TBear.
&gt; PS When you guys first starting posting, I called and someone said they
&gt; would send me a catalog. I have not gotten it yet. I guess some things never
&gt; change.
