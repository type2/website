&gt; the best to use, and the best way to take the  UGLY  housepaint of the dash

&gt; figuring out a good white to paint the rims and bumpers so I can put the rear
&gt; bumper on it and the bumper sticker Jan gave me, and I know you can stick
&gt; stickers right on the bus but I don't want to.  I have a plan, you see . BTW,
&gt; anyone ever find a list of what colours VW used for wheels and bumpers?
&gt; 

Removing the old paint, I'm sure you know by now, will depend on how it 
was applied, and whether they used enamel or latex (probably the 
latter). I don't know any paint strippers that will attack latex, but 
I'm guessing that it is not going to stick to the dash very well, unless 
they used a good primer underneath. I'd try a scraper or putty knife at 
first (start under the lip of the dash where it doesn't show). It might 
scrape off, especially if you can get the edge of the scraper's razor 
blade under the paint. Take your time, and you might be lucky to have it 
lift off.

The other methods are heat (but not around the window seals) and/or 
sand paper. I've used a high powered hair dryer with limited success to 
remove paint before. Just hold it close, and you can soften a area the 
size of the blower nozzle in about 1 minute. Actually, there are other 
tools designed for blistering paint, but I'd be careful of using that 
much heat on the dash.

If the paint refuses to peel off, drill mounted sanding disks work 
exceptionally well for small areas like this. They sell for under $5, 
and the little self-adhesive disks are easy to use. Buy the coursest 
grit you can find, and have at it. BTW, I'd put a drop cloth from the 
roof (behind the seat), and drop it over both seats, to the floorboard. 
With both doors open, and wearing a paper dust mask, it's a job you can 
finish in a day. If you can pull the gauges and such, you'll be ready 
for paint in no time. &lt;grin&gt; 

The paint on our old 65's bumpers was the same color used for the top 
and interior. They used L289, Blue White. This was when it was new, so 
I'm pretty sure it was correct (at least it looked to be the 
same-as-stock color). I can't recall, but I think the wheels were the 
same color as the bumpers. 

If prepped, the dash could be painted at the same time. One of the 
members here had a great idea. If you slip a large diameter string under 
the windshield rubber, the paint line won't show (as it will be under 
the rubber). I'd forgotten about that trick, but it does work well.

&gt; 65 Camper Update
&gt; 
&gt; examine the inside of the carb (prolly a rust clog) again, and do a 100 miile
&gt; tune up and oil change.  Yes, 100 miles, that motor sat for years and the oil
&gt; was gross.    Did I mention that it was only getting about 11mpg?   What is
&gt; up with that?  I bet it'll be happier when I get that ugly brown paint off
&gt; the dash.
&gt; 11mpg?  I'd be interested in what your eventual mileage is. Our old 65 
knocked down 17, never better or worse. My old 60 beetle, which I was 
only able to drive 300 miles before it was totaled, pulled down less 
than 10mpg. I never had time to figure out why, and it was &quot;gone&quot; before 
I got home again.
