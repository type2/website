Rob;

Take a look at the relay;  under the fuse box, should be towards the driver's
side.  Start with making sure it's pushed into place.  A loose one will leave
parking lights on,  no head lights.

Ask me how I know..... 8^)

&gt; is the mechanism that shuts the headlights off when you turn the key off but
&gt; leaves the parking light on (so you don't wear down your battery)  How does
&gt; this work and is it repairable or should I look for a new ignition switch
&gt; (if that is where the turn off feature is located?)
