Subject: [T2] Still Losing Oil--After replacing rear main Seal

Hey Everyone--

Well I am getting a bit frustrated now--just pulled the engine, with the help 
of my friend, replaced the rear main--also the rear tranny seal--got 
everything back in--the engine is running great--but I am still losing a 
great deal of oil--filled it up with about 2 1/4 quarts--drove about 100 
miles yesterday--checked the oil this morning and I was down a little below 
the FIRST line on my Dip stick---I have a 71 1600 DP with compression as 
follows #1 160 #2 135 #3 150 #4 160--checked the oil cooler while the engine 
was out and it was not leaking--replaced one push rod tube that appeared to 
be leaking---I need to figure out where this oil is going!! I leave in 5 days 
for a 1500 mile trek up to Maine---Any thoughts would be great--I looked 
under the engine and seems a little oilly on the passenger side of the 
engine--sort of right below #1 cylinder--all I know is the oil is going 
somewhere---I thought with Compression like that I wouldn't be burning the 
stuff--Thanks for the help--Adam
