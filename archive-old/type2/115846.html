&gt; the dealer sells these ones still.

When I tried to get another pair they told me they'd gone obsolete. They
were $7.

About a year ago I bought a pair through BD for $5 each but the price is now
$8. The BD keys must have come from the VW source because they have the
bumpy pattern in the logo that many of the blanks sold by the VW locksmiths
don't have.

111 837 219A is the part number, the additional code S93 mean R profile.
