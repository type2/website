Subject: Re: [T2] Air Horn

I probably toot that air horn once or twice each year. This is not
one of those occassions.

I toot my own horn every chance I get!  Seriously, I picked up a set of 
Hella dual Air Horns a few years back.  I planned on mounting them below the 
nose of my '70.  Anybody tried a set of these?  Happy with them?

Eron
