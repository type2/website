List-
The starter in one if my Busses was very weak. The solenoid seemed to work
fine but it just cranked the engine slowly. I replaced the whole starter
with an extra one that I had and now it cranks fine. I had ordered new
brushes for the weak starter but I'm wondering if I should just pay to have
it rebuilt.
My questions are: What would they do to it when they rebuild it? Could it
be just the brushes that were causing the problem? Could I fix it myself?
Since I don't really need it, it will be a spare so I have lots of time.
Thanks,
