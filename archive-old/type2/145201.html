Subject: Re: [T2] Last of the Aircooled Buses

&gt;&lt;&lt;The front of the van probably looks like the ones
&gt;that were made in
&gt;Mexico up until 2002. Slightly different roof also.
&gt;http://www.pauldottrip_dot_com/puerto_vallarta/pages/DSCN0771.htm
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt;As per the caption below the picture &quot; and yes that
&gt;is a radator up
&gt;front&quot;
&gt;
&gt;I give--why does an air cooled Bus have a radiator
&gt;mounted on it??

Maybe it's an A/C condensor?  ;-)


The late model air-cooled buses seem to have
the familiar &quot;upright&quot; engine configuration
with throttle body injection.  I suspect that
they are dual-fuel as well.  A small tank of
gasoline is on board for starting and when
all warmed up, switch over to alcohol fuel. ?
