&gt; Sounds like you're having a good time there.

I'd forgotten what fun it is to sit that high up and drive a bus!

&gt; What kind of tires are you running?

Toyo Spectrum Touring Radials
P195/75R/5R14  92S
Tread Wear 580
Traction A
Temperature B

All seem to be in good shape wear-wise, but one needs a new stem and another
a small leak plugged.  They were on the bus when we got it.
