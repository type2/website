Subject: Re: [T2] Battery Isolator Problem

I have mine set up with the heavy duty RV one like yours.  I have also 
added one of the  switches with the big plastic key used to disconnect 
batteries in the circuit.  Put the key in and turn switch and now the 
aux can jump start the starting battery.    I have been around 
electronics and automotive wiring too many years too be caught with 
small gauge wire in high current situations.  You should see melted 
cheap jumper cables we get  returned sometimes.  2 gauge wire all the 
way. and  a  small  separate fuse panel for everything coming off the  
aux battery.

&gt; By the way, you do not want small-gauge wire to be what limits the 
&gt; current flowing through your relay - it's a good way to fry the wire.  
&gt; The wire and relay need to be sized for the load or you risk burning up 
&gt; one or the other, or both.  We have enough bus fires as it is.
