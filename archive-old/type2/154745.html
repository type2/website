Subject: Re: [T2] Z bed won't fold, then it wouldn't unfold

It is a '77 Westy.

I have been wondering from some of the replies I have been getting if it has started working correctly and I don't know how to operate it.

My wife has it full of recycling bins she promises to drop off tomorrow on her way to work, hopefully tomorrow night i will have a chance to try some of the advice I have received.

I did see springs on the side of the hinge, I flicked at them a bit trying to see if I could make something happen, and it did suddenly release the irst time I ran into the problem.

Thank you,
James in Portland, Oregon


&gt; I'm not sure what year bus you have, but I have a '78 and it's supposed 
&gt; to do that. There is a spring-loaded catch on both hinges. So, let's 
&gt; say you have it set up as a bed, if you lift the seat portion, the 
&gt; catches will click and now all you have to do is pull the seat towards 
&gt; the front of the bus and the backrest will rise up and fold into the 
&gt; seat position. 
&gt; 
&gt; Now, usually to unclick it (when it's in the bed position), you just 
&gt; keep pushing the seat porting towards the back of the bus and it will 
&gt; click again and then you can pull the seat back down (towards the front 
&gt; of the bus) to the normal bed position. You might want to check out 
&gt; your catches because they can get bent and/or have broken springs.
