&gt;I have a brand new bosch 009 distributor that came with various other

Sorry Nick, the 009 is COMPLETELY inappropriate for your bus.  Please wrap 
it up and
send it to me, so I can use it as a spare for my 
bu...........er...........I mean......add it to
my collection of distributors that are COMPLETELY inappropriate for buses.

Seriously, they do not work well at all on type4 engines.  They work just 
fine on type1
engines running dual Kadrons or dual 32/34PDSITs.  Type1 engines with 
single carbs.
work best with the correct, stock dizzy--IN MY PERSONAL EXPERIENCE.  Others may
have other opinions and/or past experiences.

Check out the rebuilt distributors on aircooled_dot_net.  Their SVDA would be a 
big improvement.
I carry a spare distributor--complete through plug wires--in every one of 
my cars.  This ensures
flawless operation of those parts installed on the vehicle (things just 
work that way).

The 009 would see you through an emergency, but would not serve well in 
regular use.
