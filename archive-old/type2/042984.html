&gt; Is it possible to adjust your clutch too much?  

Yes

&gt; There is still some play in the peddle(1/2 inch).  

I *think* that should be enough, but YMMV.

&gt; How do you know when its adjusted too much?

Because the clutch slips and you have to race the engine to achieve the
same speed. :-)

&gt; The reason I ask is that after adjusting the clutch our shift points are 
&gt; sooner.  I used to shift into third at about 34 miles per hour now it sounds 
&gt; like  I need to shift at about 28.  

Kim, your clutch cable is too tight and the disk is slipping.  Back the
wing nut off a turn or two.  If you run it this way too long, you will
toast the clutch disc, then you are up for an engine pull :-(

&gt; Should I assume that shifting points change when you adjust the clutch?

They should not change!

One other possibility is that your clutch disc is simply worn out.  It
happens eventually, tho clutches tend to get replaced at engine haul time
so they rarely get the chance :-)  In any event, if your engine races and
your bus is not moving as fast as it should, then the clutch disc is
slipping.
