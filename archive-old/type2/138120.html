Subject: RIP VW Trends

Was looking at car magazines yesterday and saw the current VW Trends on 
the shelf. Nice cover, a Westy from the pre-Cambrian period. And a 
headline about 40 things every type 2 owner should buy/do. I turned to 
that, thinking that it may be a shame that the magazine is ceasing 
publication.

When I got there, I found that the text said one of the 40 things was a 
set of Hella rear light lenses for late 50s-early 60s buses. And there 
was a photograph of a late bay lens.

I closed the book and slipped it back on its shelf. RIP, VW Trends.
