Subject: BA6 Heater to List Member

Hello all,

I'm feeling flush and rosy this morning, as my newly-rebuilt engine starts 
like a champ and purrs like a kitten.  Damn those random but necessary 
ground wires, especially on those freakin' aftermarket hard-start relays.  
But I digress....

In my glow of good VW karma, I've decided to offer to the list, free of 
charge*, a BA6 heater I removed from the van.

*whoever wants it can either pick it up in Houston or pay actual shipping 
costs.

I need to know what all parts to send along.  I have no idea whether this 
thing works or not, but would think the risk of it not working should be 
worth shipping costs.  It came off my '78 Westy.

Pmail me with any questions, and I'll post back to the list as soon as it's 
spoken for.

Thanks,

Beth in Houston
'78 Westy, engine has 0 miles!
