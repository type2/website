Hi All,

I know a fellow that is selling a 1961 Westy up here near Toronto.

The interior is basically missing except for the cabinet in the rear corner
of the pass. side of the van, and it has the two curved pieces of birch
that go in the rear corners of the van. It does have the submarine hatch as
well. Basically it is missing the entire so-23 interior except for the
pieces I have mentioned.

It has 34,000 original miles on it and is still 6 volt. Body is suppoesedly
very straight but could use repaint. All brakes have been recently done w/
NOS German brake compnents. Basically the bus is driveable at the moment
(w/ minor tweaking/adjustmetns) it is needing of 80% of westy interior and
a repaint.

The guy wants to get ~$4500 CDN for it ($0.75 CDN = $1.00 US) which IMHO is
far too steep. I told him I would post it, e-mail me if you are interested
in it and I can get you more details. Usual disclaimers apply, just apssing
this along.

michael
