&gt; Well I have had a number of posts regarding my desired change over to carbs

&gt; 	&quot;DON'T DO IT.&quot;

well, I dont like the VW FI too much, so i would say go for a nice set of
duals... much more reliable, but we have had this argument over and over
and over on this list.  I am keeping my 82 vanagon FI because of emissions
inspections in missouri, but short that i would put in duals in  heartbeat
(if i could afford it)

in short, FI is better, but i personally find carbs to be more reliable
and less time consuming to troubleshoot... at least in comparison to 
the FI on the ACVW vans (we've had this argument several times too, check
the archives)  Might well be my lack of knowledge on the subject too...
but learning FI has a time cost that i am just not willing to invest at
this time.

If you do take long trips, and keep the FI be prepared to whip out your
multimeter and stash of spare parts to figure out whats wrong when it
gives out.  And dont expect any help from local mechanics or parts
houses... carry all you need both knowledge and parts wise.

take that FWIW... and also if you do go to carbs, as long as you save the
FI stuff and dont hack up any wires you can always go back if you have a
mind to.  I like FI even, i have been thinking of putting a rabbit GTI CIS
unit on an aircooled motor... has some benefits (fuel is constantly being
injected onto the intake valves, i bet its evaporation helps keep the
heads cooler...  CIS injectors have a 100% duty cycle, they just inject
fuel constantly, but in a small enough volume that the appropriate
ammount is in there when that cylinders turn to fire comes up)

take care,

Steve

p.s. search the archives at www.type2_dot_com this subject has been discussed
SO MANY times that you should find all you could ever want to know and
then some more... and some more after that.
