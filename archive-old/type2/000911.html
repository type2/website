Subject: Fuel leak &amp; check your fuel lines
Message-ID: &lt;000601be840f$7dff1ec0$133d883e_at_hal200mmx82mb&gt;
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

As part of getting the BA6 running I had to splice into the fuel line by the
tank out-let. I have a 3&quot; line then the fuel filter, this being a '76 1600
up-right, the out let is on the bottom an 'L' shape &amp; non-removable.

I crawled under to change the fuel filter &amp; fit a 'T' piece, I noticed a
dark spot on the line near the outlet. I wiggled it to see if it was a leak
&amp; the pipe started to drip, by the time I had got a big fuel container the
pipe had poped off! Fuel was being pumped _at_ pressure over the solenoid
WAAAAAAAAA!! I switched off the inspection lamp, compressor etc. Got a 2'
length of pipe &amp; had to lay in the stream of fuel to get the new pipe on.
Drained the tank &amp; got the new lines in, when I last checked the lines were
perfect.

I found several things about fuel that day.

1/
Although I had a wet blanket &amp; a fire extinguisher under there with me,
ALWAYS have some one near. Even if it's a just a neibour.

2/
Petrol stings when it gets in your eyes.

3/
Petrol makes you sick when you drink it

4/
Petrol make other list member go &quot;poo you stink&quot; when they turn up 5mins
later (hello Stuart, Monday looking good for the parts bus)

5/
The smell comes from your skin for several days even when you bathe &amp; change
your clothes.

6/
You get an uncontrollable fear of any-one with a cigarette!

yours in flames
