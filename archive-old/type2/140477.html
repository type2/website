Subject: Re: [T2] beetle muffler on bus

&gt; is it ok to use a beetle style muffler on a 70 bus?

Sure, if you want to risk dying from carbon monoxide poisoning.

Bus mufflers exit at the corner where the slip-stream is.

Buses have a vortex at the rear. No air flow away, it comes back to the bus . Ever see the back of a bus all 
spattered with oil spots when the engine has a small leak? That is because of the vortex. No matter how good 
you think the rear hatch seal is, it leaks! Exhaust gas will enter the inside.
