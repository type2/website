Tony:

I've dabbled in home and car speaker building for many years.  I have plans for a 2-sub woofer and 1 upper bass speaker system for my 71 bus.  Vented systems are rarely the best or easiest to design.  Let me know what brand and model of woofer you plan on using, and what exactly you're expecting this system to do, and I can probably come up with some suggestions.  

To confuse the matter, 99% of people working in the car audio industry don't know what the heck they're talking about.  Take any advice you get from these people with a very large grain of salt.
