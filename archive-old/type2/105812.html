Subject: Re: [T2] Rear Break adjuster

&gt; I was ajusting the rear breaks today and found the adjusters still and
&gt; almost frozen.  A quick spirt of screw loosener set them free.  Took em
&gt; out and cleaned them.   However, they were still a bit stiff when I went
&gt; to adjust them again.
&gt; 
&gt; What is the proper grease,if any, to use in this location?

Anti-size lubricant (sometimes called copper grease). Like this:

Permatex makes a copper and Aluminum one as well that may be easier to find.
Coat it everywhere there's a surface: adjuster threads, screw threads, in
the cups where the adjusters fit in the mount on the backing plate (term
escapes me).
