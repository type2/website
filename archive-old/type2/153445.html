Subject: Re: [T2] Milage of my Quest vs bus

From Kevin H. Roberts:

&quot;odometer sensor in tranny (ouch)&quot;

 Is that why mine has been stuck on 87,000 since I got the bus?  How much are they?  Cheers...KR

You are referring to your 76 camper?

If yes, does the speedometer needle work?

If yes, you have a broken gear on the end of the odometer shaft. Common problem. This place sells them but
they are not cheap:

You will need to count the number of teeth on yours. I think it is 11 but it has been a long time since I
counted one.

If no, the speedometer needle does not work. Then you have a cable problem. It is screwed on to the back of
the speedo correctly?

Ist place to look is at the left front wheel where the cable sticks thru the center of the square hole in the
wheel bearing grease cap.
