&gt; Scott,
&gt; Are the flanges available in stainless? If your company goes to the  
&gt; expense of
&gt; having these flanges waterjet, I would think you would make them  
&gt; out of
&gt; stainless, so the same problem wouldnt happen again...plus the  
&gt; repair would be
&gt; much better, i.e. you would be welding the same material together.  
&gt; When you
&gt; weld stainless to mild steel, the chromium, nickel, manganese, etc.  
&gt; immediately
&gt; cause an electrolytic effect, and you can actually watch these  
&gt; welds rust right
&gt; before your eyes. I'm gonna crawl under the bus tomorrow and check  
&gt; all of my
&gt; flanges, and if I need to replace, I'll cut some 304 out with the  
&gt; plasma
&gt; cutter. Then again, I have those types of tools.

i have not made the flanges in stainless, but as you say, it could  
easily be done.

as i understand it, the flanges are mild steel because the stainless  
has a propensity to warp under the heat it is subject to. not sure if  
this makes sense from a technical perspective, but that is how i  
understand it. all the VW manifolds are made in this same way, so  
there surely is a reason the factory used mild steel. if it was  
simply to reduce cost, then why would the pipes be stainless and not  
also mild steel? i don't have the answer...

the pipes that we rebuilt are usually original, meaning at least 25  
years of service before needing replacement, not a bad life-span. so  
i am not concerned about the flanges rusting again without having a  
reasonable life-span. but it might be something to look into. we also  
don't have a welder set up for stainless, another hurdle for us to  
leap. all food for thought.
