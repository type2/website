&gt;What's the average temp in FL? Around 75-80 right? What's your engine's

&gt;longer it will last.

My Porsche mechanic told to never warm up a car by letting it idle.
The quickest way to warm up the engine is to start driving it..not hard.
Letting an engine idle keeps the engine out of its operating temp too
long and you get more wear.
