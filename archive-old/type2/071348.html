Hello,

Looks like Steven's builder has managed to locate
some just this morning.  I'll have a set myself later
in the week for stock.  That way, should the need
arise, I'll be able to do a late syncro'd split-case
transaxle without having to turn the world upside
down to locate those parts.  I generally have the
rest in stock to include gaskets and seals and have
recently acquired a number of new-in-box split-case
trans bearings.  

Good luck Steven and keep us informed on your
project!

PS- Still waiting to hear about the reduction gearbox
bearings for all you on the Type 2 list.
