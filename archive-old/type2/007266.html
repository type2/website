Subject: Re: Alignment and Camber Tools?

&gt;I am going to check the camber and toe setting front and back on my bus.
&gt;Has anybody ever had any experiences with tools for such checks sold at
&gt;JCWhitney, etc?

I bought a caster/camber tool that I'm very pleased with from Rob at
Advanced Racing (see http://www.advancedracing_dot_com/).  A picture and
description can be found at http://www.advancedracing_dot_com/smartcam.html.
It's a bit pricey at $200 (was $160 until SmartCamber updated the electronic
module last year), but it's extremely easy to use and very accurate, and Rob
includes the stand alone accessory kit for that price, unlike the Porsche
aftermarket companies that try to sell it for $50 extra.  You could make
your own tool for measuring camber, but you might always be wondering how
accurately it measures, so in my case, for my peace of mind as well as
simplicity and the ability to use the same tool for different cars, I
decided to shop for one I'd be content with overall.  If you do make your
own and run into problems with alignment, you can double check your readings
and make inferences to help you along, e.g. if the car pulls more to one
side you can suspect that side has greater positive camber than the other,
and proceed troubleshooting/adjusting your earlier measurements from there.  

If you search the Net and your local papers, you might find a retired
mechanic selling tools and pick up a professional gauge for the same price
you'll find for the JC Whitney top-line models (don't forget to factor in JC
Whitney's shipping prices).  At the time I was shopping around I found a
couple used bubble type caster &amp; camber Bear models for $75 &amp; $175 (these
sell new for around $375).  Professional equipment is not necessary,
especially if you're not doing alignments all the time, but it's a pleasure
to use a good tool so consider treating yourself :)!  Also, add up the cost
of 3-4 alignments and you'll find you could've purchased a good tool for the
same amount.

For the toe-in, the two sticks method seems to be the tool of choice for
backyard mechanics.  I use a Matra VW tool that I picked up at a swap meet.
It's spring loaded on the scale end and has offset extensions on either end
for clearance, though I believe I'm still only able to get to about the 8 &amp;
4 o'clock position instead of 3 &amp; 9 on the rim.
