 Hay dave,
I'm doing just that.
 I have a 1970 transporter and I'm replaceing the 1600cc with a 2liter from a 
1976 westy.
 That dam east coast cancer killed my baby
 well i'm in california now and have a good project going now
 I'm using the cross member from my westy to suport the engine.
 I'm cutting off the old motor mounts and using the 2 liter mount
 alot of work but i think it's better then trying to use the stock mount.
I'll also have to shorten the 2liter mount to fit the frame on my transporter.
I'm also looking for info on the pilot shaft bearing to see if it the same as 
a 1600cc
to the 2000cc motor.
 then i'm getting an upright shroud from dtm tech 
 for cooling purpose
 so if you find any thing else that would make this easyer drop me a line
