Subject: Re: [T2] Prepping Westy for paint

Hi John

I know exactly how you feel, I did my own paint job just a few months ago,
recarpeted and redo all the pop top (including sewing and installation of a
new hand made purple canvas) yes is some work involved in the process but
the question is how far you really want to go, since mine was pastel white
but some previous owner spray a very ugly yellow over the bottom half, so I
decided to painted all over with the original yellow tone used those years.
My error was that I took my decision just after reassembly the interior and
recarpeted, so the interior is still white and the amount of work was the
same.
If you want a good finish do the things in the right way or if you want just
an improvement over your actual situation its O.K, my advice is to choose
what do you want FIRST and then work for it and please don not change your
mind in the middle of the process because the results used to be undesired.
If you want I had some pictures of my budget resto that I can pmail.
