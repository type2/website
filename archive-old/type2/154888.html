Subject: RE: [T2] Cold Start Valve wiring... and more

Ok, got the cold start valve working properly.
Thanks Karl and Scott!

Now, the motor only starts for a few seconds and then tapers off. I suspect
that it is only getting fuel from the cold-start valve. I CAN feather the
throttle when the starter motor is operating and get a blast of RPMs, but it
then immediately quits.

But where to start with the diagnosis? (beginning with the usual suspects).

Things I &quot;know&quot; work:
Timing
Spark
Double Relay
Injector resistor block
All new vacuum lines, hoses and connectors
S-Boot is nearly perfect

BTW, this is a 78 2.0L (California with EGR omitted)

Thanks,

Jon
