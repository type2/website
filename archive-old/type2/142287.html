Subject: RE: [T2] VW parts vendor with fastest delivery...

I hate to be the one to complain about a vendor, especially when they are on
the list, but I always have to wait for BD. Even with expedited shipping. The
last thing I ordered was a brake caliper and I got the wrong one, no invoice
and only one bleeder screw when I ordered 4. It was also took longer than
expected to get here. When I called, they were out of stock on the other 3
bleeder screws and told me that I would just have to bend the brake line to
work with the new caliper. Luckily I was planning on bending new brake line
anyway. It worked, but I have no idea what year caliper I have on it now. It
was bigger, but seemed to clear everything. Not ideal, but I needed brakes and
I wait for 3 days for this one.

BD is one of the only places that I deal with, but I always have to order more
than a week before I need the part. If you do not pay for fast shipping, then
it takes 7 days to process your order, then it is shipped. Always has been
this way for me. I just know this and try to order early.

I am also in Va, not far from BD.
