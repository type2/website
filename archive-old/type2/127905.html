Subject: Re: [T2] Brake Pedal = Stalled Engine

per the original post:

&gt;&gt;Should there be any change in the rpm's when the pedal is pressed? 
 I checked
the lines leading to the brake servo and the &quot;check&quot; valve, all are
functioning 100% with no leaks.&lt;&lt;

no, there should be no change when the pedal is pressed.

since you have stated that the check valve is operating properly,
be sure it is not installed backwards.

good luck,
