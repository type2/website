&gt;&gt; Turns out that wd40 &quot;poisons&quot; the ceramic in the plugs so that it conducts

&gt;&gt; New plugs....end of story...yes, he did clean his plugs and then sprayed

&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Bob,  did you have wd40 nearby when installing new plugs???&lt;grin&gt;
&gt;
&gt;NO never always keep WD40 in a seperate locations so they cannot co-mingle
&gt;
&gt;besides I usually use CRC anyway BUT not on plugs...they are clean out of
&gt;the box, don't clean plugs, I replace em

Oh you know I misunderstood Dave's original post, Bob brings that to clarity
if your dad &quot;cleaned&quot; the tips of the plugs, that was probably a bad idea.  I
was talking the outside ceramic.  Thought somehow that was shorting out.
