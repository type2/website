&lt;&lt; My ''80 Westy does that too, in addition to a nasty grind/squeak when

 its brake pad (or, worse, the caliper) on one side or the other.  I hope 
 someone has a good answer to that -- it is indeed a rather 
expensive-sounding 
 noise. &gt;&gt;


Check to make sure you have both caliper mounting bolts in place on both 
sides This could be a reason why you are hearing your grinding noise. With 
only one caliper mounting bolt your caliper will kind of float around and 
when you brake the caliper will be forced to hit the inside of your rim. 
Leave a nice scrape around the inside of the rim and the outside of the 
cailper.
