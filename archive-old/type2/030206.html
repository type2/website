&gt; &gt;I finally completed my slow job of converting the '71 from generator to
&gt; &gt;alternator.  
&gt; 
&gt; Good for you. It is the kind of job that takes attitude and tenacity. The
&gt; big problem I have with in-situ fan shroud removal is getting the back of
&gt; the shroud to fit the lower tin upon replacement. With the motor out, it
&gt; takes a minute or two. With the motor in, it MIGHT fall into place ok, or
&gt; it COULD take hours.

In my case it fell in the middle.  The left side dropped in perfect, but
the right side was stubborn.  One trick I learned was to put fender
washers and hex head bolts on the ends of the shroud and the hoover bit.
The larger washers guide themselves onto the correct side of the cylinder
tin and doghouse tin

&gt; If you haven't already, I would replace the
&gt; indicator bulb. Excess
&gt; resistance in the bulb or it's circuit can cause problems with Bosch
&gt; alternators. It is critical to correct function.

The alternator seems to be working correctly except for the initial
startup.  Voltage is within specs and steady at all engine speeds.  I
think the initial light is due to excess resistance in the wiring or the
idle being set too low.  I'll check the idle speed when I get home to my
tachometer.  If it checks out I'll go after the indicator circuit.
