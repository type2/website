Ahhh-- forgot to mention that I also adjusted the afm.  There's a little 
screw that you can loosen (it has a locking compound on it.)  I adjusted the 
screw about a tooth and a half to the lean side and reapplied some locking 
compound.  I'm in San Diego so I had to pass the dyno california test too.
