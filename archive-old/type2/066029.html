Subject: New purchase.

Hello all,

        I have been reading alot of mail from everyone on the &quot;Vanagon&quot; &amp; &quot;Type2&quot; mail lists. Both 
have an unbelievable amount of information on them for us VW enthusiasts. I am one myself and would 
love to own one of every design. From a Bug to a Bus and everything in between. Since this is 
financially impossible, I will have to settle right now for a single purchase. I found a 1978 
Westfalia camper. I will try to explain the condition and hopefully I can get some idea of the 
worth of this vehicle. It is currently sitting in a garage waiting to be removed for further 
inspection.

        The condition of his van is as follows:

        - No engine
        - 140,000 miles
        - Door in good working condition
        - Some rust starting to creep in the rear quarters
        - 4 speed transmmission
        - Sink, stove, ad refrigerator
        - Needs to be painted
        - Support beams in good shape
        - Needs tires
        

        Most of the work is involves restoreing the interior to get it clean and t replace the 
little things here and there. I don't know what condition the suspension or steering is in. I think 
this is enough information for someone out there to give me range to shoot for. The thing about 
this van is that, it is the first one I have looked at and I have never owned one of these things 
before. It is right near my house and the guy has shitload of spare parts lying around. I guess I 
am trying to save the time and money of driving around New England and trying to find a van 
somewhere. I don't want to be driving all over the place and finding the van to be a piece of crap. 
I live in RI and have no idea what the market is like for these vans. Are they hard to find around 
here? Do the prices vary from different areas of the country? Any advice on this matter will be 
greatly appreciated.


        Thank you for listening to my rambling and I hope someone out there can help me.
