Subject: Re: [T2] Running hot

&gt; It's tough to get reliable responses to &quot;is my oil too hot&quot; questions
since
&gt; everybody drives with a different style, over varying terrains, using
&gt; different temp sensors located at different places on the engine.  The
&gt; closest &quot;universal&quot; test is the old &quot;dipstick&quot; test.  After a run go back
&gt; and pull the dipstick.  If it's too hot to handle, or you can just barely
&gt; handle it, then your oil is too hot.  By reference I can drive my '81 at
&gt; freeway speeds (65-70) for several hours and then *easily* handle the
&gt; dipstick - it's barely warm.


Ah.. So then I am not overheating.. :-)

For those of you wondering on the dipstick method, this pretty much works.
But keep in mind that it is highly unscientific and nothing beats the
combination of probing the cylinder head temps and the oil temps.

Now where did I put that coffee.
