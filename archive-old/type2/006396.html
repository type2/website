I have a '79 7 pass. and am interested in converting it into a Westy.
Actually, I am not as interested in the conversion process as I am in the
end result. Would I be better off just saving my nickels and dimes and
buying a Westy or would there be some value in converting it myself? The
main reason that I would want to convert it myself is the whole &quot;parable of
the boiled frog&quot; thing. It is easier to push smaller purchases past the
committee (my wife) until I finally have a Westy than to spring the whole
thing on her at once.
If I were to do it myself, where could I find the necessary information (web
sites, books, people that have already done it, etc)?

I have browsed through the archives for related posts but was unable to find
any. If there are some then just let me know where to find them.
