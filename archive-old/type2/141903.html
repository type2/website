Subject: Engine Install Question (Leaning)

Thanks to all who replied to my previous question regarding the 2.0L into a 
74 westy.  I install the motor and tranny this afternoon but it appears to be 
leaning towards one side??  It leans towards the passangers side by about 2&quot; or 
so.  Everything is snugged but not fully torqued.  Are there any adjusting 
points? Here is some background.
 Ive intalled a 78 2.0 into a 74 westy.  Converted to a 2brl carb, and 091 
tranny.  Everything fits fine, its just leaning??  Any suggestions, where I 
should look, what may cause this or is there a way to adjust??  One more thing, 
the bus is still jacked up and the passangers CV is still disconected.....

Any suggestions would help..
thanks in advance
and have a HAPPY TURKEY DAY.
