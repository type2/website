&gt; amazing junk yard nearby that has about 200 busses (mostly bays) in it,
&gt; great for finding hard to find stuff.

hmmm,  a trip to Richmond may be in order...are they open Sundays?? are
they pick and pull or do you have to &quot;know&quot; what you want??  and of course
how are the prices?  hmmm, maybe link up with some other locals (Barry?)
and do a group scavange/recovery.  could share tools that way too. only
need one of each heavy tool.  (if it is like Crazy Rays it costs a $1
every time you run to your bus for something you forgot)
