Subject: fuel pump

I am still having problems to start my 78 westy. It is a 2L fuel
injection. It was parked for winter
It will start and stop after a few seconds. Sometimes I will run for
maybe 5 seconds but as soon as I press the gas pedal it dies very fast.
I checked the cold start valve, it works. Changed the fuel filter.
When I turn the ignition key on I hear a click from the little box on
the fire wall (drivers side) I guess that’s normal? But I don’t hear the
fuel pump. I disconnected the pump and it works with a small battery.
Any ideas where I should look?

I did an experiment by unplugging the hose after the fuel pump, and when
I rotate the engine, fuel is comming out, like if the fuel pump is
working but I don’t hear it. Can the fuel come out even if the fuel pump
doesnt work or am I just loosing my senses? Is the engine forcing air in
the fuel tank? I still have a lot to learn as you see...

Hopefully I will not have to bring her to a mechanic - or maybe I
should. And she probably feels a bit neglected, I have so little time to
work on her.
