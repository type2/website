Subject: Re: [T2] re:    Pertronix questions

Hi all,

I'm one of those who has had such a failure just this year.  they only 
lasted 200 miles and left me stranded and missing a very important 
weekend visit with kids/grandkids.  I went back to points and will 
probably stay until I'm certain of a more reliable replacement.

Jeff

&gt;&gt; Hello Guys     I have seen so many of the pertronix fail it is
&gt;&gt; silly, I tell everyone using them to carry a set of points and
&gt;&gt; condser with them.  I personally  have been using the Crane units on
&gt;&gt; my customers cars with  only one failure in the last 15 years.

&gt; I have a question for the list. several people have been running them
&gt; with little problem, and some have have horrible experiences with the
&gt; durn things. Who has bought one in the past, say 2 years or so and
&gt; have one fail? I have 3 in various stages of use and no failures.
