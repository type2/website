Subject: Re: [T2] Bus Front Beam

&gt; should I buy a stock front end or a lowered front end, say 2&quot; or so?....if
&gt; I
&gt; buy the lowered front end how far can I go using stock parts?  is there
&gt; any
&gt; advantage to the lowered front end?
&gt;


We would need to know exactly which lowered front end you're talking about.

The ideal solution to lowering is with drop spindles and that wouldn't
require a new front beam (though you said you need one anyway). Adjustable
beams lower by changing the geometry of your suspension. Drop spindles just
relocate the wheel to a different location while maintaining the original
geometry.

Is there a benefit to lowering? Aside from appearances, probably not. You do
lower your center of gravity a bit. Is it enough to do any good? Probably
not.
