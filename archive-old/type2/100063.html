Subject: Thieves hit my westy! Help replacing front window!

hi.

I was crushed yesterday to find that someone had broken into my 76 westy.
the bastard thief used the traditional method of breaking into a bus and
wedged a tool in the small front window on the passenger side. the good news
is that they didn't break the window, the bad news is they bent the frame
and latch all to hell.

I took a look at the window and didn't see any obvious way to replace just
the frame and latch... or how I would pull the whole assembly to replace it
with one from the junkyard. I'm sure this is a common problem, does anyone
know how to replace that unit?

this is the 9th time someone has violeted one of my vehicles in SF. today
I'm going to look at car alarms.

many thanks,
pete
