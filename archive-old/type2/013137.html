I look at your opportunity this way.

If it's already out I'd pull the heads, install new rings, install new
rod bearings(after checking the crank), have the heads cleaned and
inspected, lap the valves. As part of this procedure you'll be installing
new pushrod seals, valvecover gaskets, oil cooler seals; in short *it's a
lot easier and cheaper to add this insurance at this point and drive with
confidence*. Total cost for parts, about $100.00 plus the head service
and having the glaze broken off your cylinders. I wouldn't even venture a
guess about labor if you did not do the work yourself.

&gt; &gt;you tell what type of condition the motor is while it's out of the
&gt; &gt;vehicle?
