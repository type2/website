&gt;Are you hand cranking an early (earlier than I  heard of) bus 
&gt;that has this as an original equipment set up, or using an 
&gt;aftermarket widget that you added on?  The 1600 cc thingy 
&gt;makes me think the latter is more probable.  If so, I want 
&gt;one!

I'm using an original setup, which was used up until '57 or '58 or so.
Completely factory.

I've never seen an aftermarket one.
