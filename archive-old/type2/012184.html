Well, I convert that to 50 degrees F, which may have
stiffened your seals up a little. I usually warm mine
up with a hair dryer before I put them in, it softens
them up a touch, makes them work a little easier.

As to sealant, I've never used it on any aircooled
window, but logically, it makes sense. On the other
hand, how would you get it in there? Use it in place
of lubricant, and hope it doesn't dry before you get
done?

&gt; Temperature was about 10 degrees celcius. (don't

&gt; equivelant).  

&gt; I would appreciate your feedback on the topic of
&gt; sealant.  There is a
&gt; posting from someone who said that a sealant should
&gt; be applied.  I
&gt; understood that sealants were necessary or
&gt; recommended, that the rubber
&gt; would make the seal if properly set on clean metal. 
&gt; What's your view?
