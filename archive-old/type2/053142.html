Subject: Target Bus Attire

For those that emailed me regarding the shorts and things at Target -

Den just reminded me about this.

I did go by my two local Target stores when the thread was hot, and alas,
the Hawaii shirt was no more, as were the boxers.

I was remiss in not pmailing those who asked.

Please forgive Itch - it was his fault.
