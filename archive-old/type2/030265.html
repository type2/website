&gt; I've had Pertronix and Computron and they both failed and I re-installed
&gt; my stock points.
&gt; I'm just not going to be crippled by cheap *super ignition* that isn't
&gt; super at all.
&gt; Getting another replacement of a poor product isn't a fix when you're on
&gt; the side of the road installing your stock point set to get home. If they
&gt; paid tow charges as part of their warranty they would be owned by AAA.

And youve never had points fail?
Really this is one of those preferance things and some people just arent
comfortable with them.
Ive had the same pertronix for about 3+ years I suppose it will faile
eventually. I have a spare dizzy under the bed which Id have if there was
points in there too.
