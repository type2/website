&gt; &gt;install a cigg outlet, and buy an inverter and a little floor heater?

WAY too much current draw.  A little 1000W heater would pull 80 amps
continuously!

&gt; 
&gt; would folks on the list speak to the practicality of an installed accessory
&gt; outlet (cigarette or westy silver socket) and an electric blanket hookup?
&gt; has anyone had success with that set-up? and how about the potential to run
&gt; an electric blanket on a long line to the sleeping areas.

Probably too much current draw for those either, but motorcyclists use
electric clothing while travelling.  Would probably work a treat in a bus!
