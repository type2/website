&gt;	Here's one.  I have a Campmobile with vehicle ID numbers that
&gt;classify a 1970.  
&amp;
&gt;	However, The vehicle nose has the signal-running lamps up top on
&gt;either side of the air inlet vents(suggesting 74'?-79), instead of below
&gt;just above the front bumper.  

I have a VW tech bulletin somewere from when the replacement front skin 
for the earlier style became NLA from VW, it describes the use of the 
newer model replacement skin as a replacement and lists the extra parts 
-like the indicators- needed for the repair/replacement.
