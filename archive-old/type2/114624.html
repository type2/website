Subject: ball joint thread size?

I cannot find a tool place near me to help measure the thread size 
using the nut, But I'm guessing it's somewhere around 17mm 1.5 pitch?  
Please if anyone knows, or can direct me to a resource, It would be 
much appreciated, so I can try to locate a die to clean up the threads

Thanks
