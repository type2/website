Subject: [T2] Type 4 case

Hey Volks,
How much should I expect to pay for a decent type 4
engine case? 1.7, 1.8 or 2.0 ? I currently have a 1.7L 1972
Type 4 in my bus but it needs work and I'm thinking of building
up my own long block. Any thoughts or input would be appreciated.
Thanks,
Jeff and The Frijole Grande (with one rod a knockin')
