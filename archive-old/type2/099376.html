&lt;&lt; Now for the hard question.  

Where can I find a 46 mm socket or wrench?

Thanks &gt;&gt;

Any good FLAPS should be able to order it from their tool supplier...Mine's
an old S-K 3/4 drive and breaker bar; but an adaptor can bring it down to
1/2 to use my ratchet handle or torque wrench. Keep an eye out at yard
and garage sales for tools...Even broken, Snap-On and other brands are
worth buying...Just turn 'em back in for replacements.
