&gt;
&gt;&gt;Just bought a '68 camper and need to have it towed home (approx 45 mi one
&gt;&gt;way) so we'll be doing the old UHaul and trailer bit I guess unless anyone
&gt;&gt;has a better/cheaper/safer idea?
&gt;
&gt;You can pull some truly hair-raising towing stories out of the archive if
&gt;you apply yourself. 8) I'd agree with the others, get all the wheels off
&gt;the ground if you can. That bus exceeds UHaul's maximum by only about 1K
&gt;lbs and their people are supposed to watch for this so you will have to lie
&gt;to them and claim you're going to pull a Beetle if you want to rent the
&gt;trailer.

     According to the users manual on the '78, if you tow for more than 
30 (or maybe it was 50) miles you must either use a 4 wheel or remove the 
drive shafts. When I moved from Texas to N. Cal, I paid the extra $70 for 
a 4 wheel trailer. I was busy enough with packing the whole family into a 
moving van, and didn't feel like the extra time pulling the axles off and 
putting 'em back on was worth the $70. 

     Be sure to shop around, I found wide discrepancies between uhaul, 
penske and ryder-eventually got my moving van and trailer for about $500 
less than the competitors from penske. And on that subject, when moving 
long distance/one way (I know you aren't, this it more for the list), 
check into towns in the general vicinity of your destination. I chopped 
$200 off the price of my move by returning the van to LA rather than 
Sacramento or San Francisco. Sure, it's a bit of a drive, but I've got 
friends in LA, so it was a good excuse to visit 'em...  ;-)


Peace,
