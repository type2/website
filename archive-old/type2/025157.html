Subject: RE: [T2] type2 price question



If you are in the know, there are plenty of busses for reasonable prices out
here on the East Coast.

Here in California I'd say you'd have good luck with that quality/price
combination. Saw a sage green for sale as you described a few months back.
Don't know about Eastern States, prices probably a lot higher.
