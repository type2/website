&gt; I asked my local VW mechanic what he thought I should do.  He suggested that

&gt; look like.  I guess I'll know in a few thousand miles if this works!!

I don't know if it would be a good idea to use JB weld for this purpose.
I'd rather have something more solid and exact.  You could make
metal shims to go in the bottom of the holes before the dowel pins go in,
filing the shims to get exactly the right projection of the pins.
