I know what you mean, but those options all assume I have some $$ available 
for it. If it was setting in my driveway, I could begin fixing it up without 
any $$ off the bat.

My wife would NOT appreciate me getting another bus, since my hitop is 
already taking quite a bit of time... ;)

However, it's awesome of you to offer to help!

I don't mean to sound flippant but being SoCal isn't a problem from my point 
of view.

It could be towed or shipped OR a new owner could show up with a power plant 
and I'd help slap it in.

I'm working with ya people.
