&gt; The question is, was it the *same* engine? Or did they beef it up for longer
&gt; service life?

AFAIK, the only change made to the bus engines to increase service life
was the installation of the bus muffler.  The smaller outlet dropped a
couple of horsepower on the top end, which makes the driver take it a bit
easier.
