Subject: Re: [T2] Shift Coupler

ok, i have to say something here... everyone so far has said the trans
has to be pulled to replace the rear coupler... my buddy pete just
replaced mine in about 15 minutes by lying under the bus and just
switching them out... no trans removal involved. now mine is a 70, maybe
that has something to do with it (i have heard people say there are more
difficulties involved with working on the pancake engines) it did involve
me wiggling the shifter to move it in or out of his way... not sure
which. what year is the bus in question?

my part only cost about $5...

chris, the girlie one
