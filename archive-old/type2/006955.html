&gt;Does anyone know of a good way to clean up the corroded aluminum
&gt;on the louvered windows in a camper?  I have tried the usual corrosion
&gt;removal jellies with very little success.  Any ideas?  Is it going to
&gt;have to be steel wool and elbow grease?

Steel Wool and elbow grease is what I had to use.  After I got it cleaned 
up, I waxed the whole thing with Johnson's hard paste wax to help keep it 
from corroding again.

There is a company here in the Silicon Valley that can remove aluminum 
corrosion, but I decided that pulling the things apart and removing all 
the glass and rubber was too much trouble.
