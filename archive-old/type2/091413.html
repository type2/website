Jim,
	Spend the small amount extra &amp; get the correct muffler for your
bus. They both function the same, but the bus muffler exits from the
side &amp; tends to put those nasty exhaust fumes out of the low pressure
pocket that follows our busses on the highway. You might be ok if all
your seals are perfect, but why risk it. Plus i just looked at
busdepot &amp; noticed that the regular bus muffler is only $60, so not
much more.

&gt; The general consensus is to get her fixed ASAP.
&gt; I know I probably shouldn't open this can of worms, but here goes.
&gt; What reccommendations do you have for a muffler.
&gt; I have a stock 1600 DP I pulled from my Beetle.
&gt; One of the FLARS has a plain Bug muffler for $45.
