Subject: egr valve gasket and cleaning

On the subject of egr valves. I need the gasket between the plenum and
the valve. I also need the gasket between the valve and the
air pipe from the exhaust. Does anyone have a source for these or do I
have to cut them out of some gasket material myself?
Also I know this had been mentioned before,but spray oven cleaner works
great on cleaning the inside of the valve.
