&gt; I've never heard of that either, connecting an ammeter to the earth.
Reasoning it
&gt; through, ideal resistance of earth strap = 0, resistance of ammeter
= 0, so ammeter
&gt; could read from 0-full current flow!!!!!

The true resistance of the earth strap, while low, is not zero.  When
current passes through the earth strap, there is a voltage drop across
it.

The meter I saw appeared to be a standard panel voltmeter of perhaps
100mV (a guess) input for maximum needle indication  It could
accurately measure the small voltage drop across the ground strap.

Thinking of it further, I have no idea how they handled the starting
current, which should have fried the meter if it was designed to
indicate mid-scale with normal charging current.  Perhaps they put a
diode in the circuit so that only charging would result in current
flow through the meter.

If I were to do this, it might be better to use the hot wire that goes
from the isolation relay to the aux battery.  If you measure the
voltage drop across this wire, you will still get a good indication of
the amps going into the battery.  Since this wire isn't used for
starting, your meter would be protected.  You would need two wires
instead of one to the meter in the front, but two-conducter wire is
easy to find and use.

&gt; In my experience, my voltmeter's connections
&gt; have been 2-3 times less reliable than the actual battery/split
charge connections,
&gt; so it would be a useful indicator of ammeter reliability!!!! (Full =
ammeter good, 0 =
&gt; ammeter wiring faulty!)

&gt; So, how about a single light (say green), that flashes when all is
okay (like temp,
&gt; pressure, revs, fuel all within a specified range). It could be
located on the dash and
&gt; also at each side. It flashes, you know all is well. It stops
flashing and you start to
&gt; check the gauges for out-of-ideal conditions. Just a pipe-dream.......

There are instrument packages for aircraft that combine several
instruments (CHT, EGT, Oil Temp, Fuel Pressure, etc.) into one unit. 
These allow you to set alarms for high and low conditions on each
sensor.  If one of these conditions is reached, an alarm goes off and
the pertinent data is shown on the LCD screen.  Sounds like just what
you need.  Have your Visa card handy? :)

&gt; I admire the top fuel dragster drivers who have a single gauge (fuel
pressure) in front
&gt; of them.

Well, with their engines it either goes or blows.  Not much time to
perceive a problem in a quarter mile!
