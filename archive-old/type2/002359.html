&gt;   I am thinking about parting out my 73 Bus and was wanting to know if
&gt; the Exhaust(complete system) could be installed on my 77.

Yes, if you also swap out the heat exchangers.  The ports on the heads are a
slightly different shape, but the difference is small enough that the
gaskets will make up the difference.

&gt;    The other Question is will the AFC's from a 411 or 412 fit or work
&gt; in a Bus?

I'm fairly certain they are not interchangeable - at least on the 411's I've
seen.
