&gt; for what it is worth, I had a 60 with a sunroof.  hated it, never could
&gt; get the thing to seal.  always leaked from day one!
&gt;
&gt; &gt; ragtop measures out to just fit in, I still may just weld a new patch in
&gt; &gt; place of the hole.  Sounds like the water issue may be more trouble than I
&gt; &gt; can stand.   Thanks again everyone for the help.
