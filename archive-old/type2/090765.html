Subject: Re: [T2] Coil Failed

&gt; I was driving my bus home last night when the engine quit (1600 DP

&gt; scene of the crime and installed it.  Started right up.

&gt; I've never had a coil fail before.  Is this common or could something
&gt; else have caused the coil to fail?

Well as someone else said, a bad condensor *can* cause a coil to fail.
Letting the bus sit with the key on (to play the radio) can also strain
the coil.  But after 20-30 years, just age can cause failure as well.  It
is not common, but it does happen.
