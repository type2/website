Subject: Re: Lookin into 77/78 Campers

&gt;If anyone has any information that might help me make up my mind between a
&gt;77 or 78 camper bus,  I would really appreciate it.

Minimal differences.  The '78 uses hydraulic lifters, which eliminates the 
necessity for valve adjustments.  On the other hand, these lifters tend to 
get somewhat noisy when they get up there in mileage, and there is the 
potential for a lifter to collapse (not extremely common, though).  If 
you're not the type to do your own valve adjustments every 6k miles, buy 
the '78.
All other parts are the same, unless there are differences in California 
emissions that I am not aware of.  I would probably base my decision on 
other criteria (condition, etc.) rather than the motor difference.  By the 
way, are these the Deluxe models (with stove, dual battery, city water 
hookup, etc.)?  If you plan to do a lot of camping, you might appreciate 
those extra features.
Good luck!
