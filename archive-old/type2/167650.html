&gt; &gt; Whole dumpster of other stuff, several fair bay heater boxes, and
&gt; &gt; somewhat sadly about 50 T1, and T4 cranks, all greased carefully, in
&gt; &gt; cloth wrapped around them, had been sitting in plastic containers, set

&gt; Speaking of VW places being auctioned: Does anyone know anything about the
&gt; VW place just outside of Morgantown, WV on Route 119 (just before you hit
&gt; Point Marion, PA)?


also wasn't there a place near Uniontown PA on the old route to
Pittsburgh??  I bought some cables from the guy, said he had several
construction trailers full of cables for VW....??
