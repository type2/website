Subject: FREE to a good home

For all of you Vanagon owners: I have a brown rear seat from an 83.5 water cooled Vanagon that I will give away for free to anyone who wants to come get it out of my barn which is located about 20 miles northeast of Cincinnati, Ohio (sorry, but I won't ship it).  Since I have sold my Vanagon, I no longer need this seat.  It is in Very good condition with no rips or stains, color is brown with kind of a sprinkling of black in the panels. It is NOT a weekender bed, just rear full width bench with back that folds down forward. Please email me off-list if you want this seat.  If you have any aircooled parts you'd like to give me as an exchange, that's great, but if not thats OK too.



Peace, John Baker
