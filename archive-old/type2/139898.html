&gt; &gt; I'm looking at the maps now and find that the &quot;direct&quot; route goes via
&gt; &gt; I-15 fto I-70. That looks like a pretty steep highway.
&gt; &gt; The other option is to take I-40 to Santa Fe, NM and then swing north
&gt; &gt; on I-25 which will dump me right at the office.
&gt;
&gt; Well, I've done both and do recommend the southern route, especially this
&gt; time of year.  There are a couple of geologic &quot;facts of life&quot; in

&gt; for the rest of the trip.  There are significant grades along the way...
&gt; Albuqueque is in a bowl and it's a long drop and rise on I-40 and 25,
&gt; Santa Fe being the peak of the exit. There's another peak indicated at the
&gt; Colorado border (which I see on the topo map, but do not remember) and one
&gt; coming into Denver (again, I don't remember it) but there is no real slog

Raton Pass.
