&gt;Hello everyone.
&gt;My friend has a '78 automatic fuel injected bus.  It just recently had a

&gt;haven't figured out is that it quits every time it gets warmed up.

Fuel
Air
Spark

Start with the most obvious, and work towards the less likely.

My order of inspection would be:
Check for spark immediately when it acts up, and before it cools down.
Then go to a fuel flow check.
The go to and air check.
