Subject: Paint and Body supplies

Where do all of you out there get your supplies for body and paint?  Are
there any mail order places besides Eastwood that you all know of?  I am
looking for a source for wet/dry sand paper and for a HVLP gun that will
shoot both Polyester primer and paint.

Any help would be apreciated.
