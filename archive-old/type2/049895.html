Subject: [T2] Seat Heaters

I ordered an &quot;Easybleed&quot; brake bleeder tool from IPD. They're actually a
Volvo specialist located in Portland, but they have a nice catalog with a
lot of useful tools and products. One thing I saw in their catalog was a
&quot;seat heater kit&quot; I immediately thought of the van, because I have to admit
one of the nicest features of my '97 Golf K2 is its' seat heaters. They
provide almost immediate heat to a place that really needs it. 
Now the kit in their catalog is described as an &quot;inexpensive alternative to
original equipment&quot;. So it doesn't look like it's just Volvo specific. 
The kit is made in USA and includes &quot;one seat cushion heater element, one
seat back heater element, finished wiring harness and stylish illuminated
switch.&quot; It says further that it installs with common hand tools in about an
hour. Cost is $72.50/seat. Part number is CQ9K3600
I couldn't find these on their website www.ipdusa_dot_com. I haven't called
them, but I'm wondering if this could be fitted to a bus. I have sheepskin
covers protecting my seats, and it seems like these could fit nicely
underneath. Has anyone ever used a kit like this?
