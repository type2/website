Subject: 75 westy parts..

well, since the 75 is now retired, it has been sugested to me to part it 
out..

if you need something, letme know. and quick, cause alot of the interior 
is out in my old garage..and it has to move fast, as i have no where to 
put it...

btw: the stuff is NOT in excelent condition, but..
