&gt; I have an AC in my bus (dunno who installed it, it's a huge white console above
&gt; the cockpit) and I was wondering if the blower for it can be converted for
&gt; auxiliary heating in any way.. I DONT need air conditioning, but I could use
&gt; some more heat.

Dear Chris,

I have a 77 with the overhead ac. An ac engineer friend of mine is going to convert it to a
115v ac system by replacing the engine driven compressor with an electric compressor. Why? For
camping. I'll be able to go to any hot park in this hot state of Florida, plug in, and sleep
coolly at night.

Think twice before yanking yours.
