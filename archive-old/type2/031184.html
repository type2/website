&gt; Well it's Friday!
&gt; My only question today is: I need to pull my engine and tranny, but live in 
&gt; an apartment complex that won't let me do it here. Any suggestions? I was 
&gt; thinking of renting out a storage space or something. Any ideas would help.

Where is here???

in many older parts of the country they will rent garages, automobile type
garages.  I have rented one for (currently $60 month) for better than 15
years.   not perfect but usually listed in the classifieds. If your in
Baltimore the one next to mine is vacant.
