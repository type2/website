BTDT
&gt; 
&gt; Bus is '78 FI, 2 liter with 150k miles.  Very good starting, power and

about the same as mine  

&gt; and hear a &quot;clunk&quot; followed by increasingly louder &quot;clacking&quot; sounds.
&gt; Pull over and towed it home.  Bus starts right up, loud clacking seems to 
&gt; come from right head.  All valves seem loose (stock hydraulic) except one

mine was a bad connecting rod to piston bearing, side of piston is
slapping against side of cyl.  (consider it dead)

YMMV
