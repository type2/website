Subject: Excuse my umbridge

It comes to mind that last year China, by natural reproduction, created 7
million people!  It also comes to mind, that there are 18 billion people,
&quot;there&quot;.  Now, because I am a simplistic man, and it is not quite Friday,
China has also become the worlds highest consumming beer country, and
&quot;quickly&quot; behind it, or in front of that statistic, is the fact &quot;they&quot; are the
number one cigarette consumption country in the world, and there fore, why are
&quot;we&quot; as a group worried about &quot;smog&quot; tests,..here, when the &quot;bad stuff&quot;, is
already aloft, and comming via the &quot;natural&quot; wind course, eventually, it will
not matter, how many &quot;hydrocarbons&quot;, are emitted from what you have to deliver
same, it will already be upon you, and &quot;change&quot; to that option, will take
&quot;humungous&quot; effort!  Some how, living on the &quot;Wet Coast&quot; of Canada, I feel all
of the &quot;smog&quot; tests, will be proved irrelevant, because, &quot;we&quot; are the
receivers, and in a &quot;perfect&quot; world, (I am still looking!), there could be
&quot;change&quot;, by consortium, and not commercialism, but the &quot;dragon&quot;, is awake,
and now the requim!  Sorry, prolly these Perscription drugs for &quot;flu!
