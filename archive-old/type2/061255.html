Hi Volks,

I just got a message from the ad photographer claiming copyright.  I 
added a copyright notice to the site, but I'm not sure if it's going 
to be up there much longer (as these things happen quite rapidly at 
times), so if you didn't yet save the image you wanted, now would be 
a good time to do so.

The URL again is 
http://www.bulli_dot_org/erik/suv.html

Please excuse the intrusion on a Tuesday.  And if any of you have any 
matching Bay pictures -- I'm still looking.

Yours,
    Erik.
