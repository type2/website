Subject: Re: [T2] Can you turn on the heat already?

&gt; The flaps on the fan shroud are gone.  I'm not sure that I
&gt; ever had them but, I can't find them in my box of junk.  Anyone know
&gt; where to get them?


Busted Bus, Interstate Used Parts, Bus Boys, are good places to start.


I really can't see why they matter but, I've seen
&gt; a few references mentioning their importance.


Your oil cooler hasn't been getting the airflow it needs with the flaps
missing. They direct air to the oil cooler when wide open.


Was there
&gt; ever any other type of gasket in this area?  Maybe around the bottom
&gt; of the heat exchanger?


Not in any of the ones I've seen.


My heat exchangers are leaking at both ends
&gt; but, I don't have the money to replace them for this winter.  I will
&gt; replace them before next year though.  I have some flexible RTV
&gt; silicone that I'm going to try to use to seal up both ends of the heat
&gt; exchangers.  I hope it will last until spring.  If anyone has tried
&gt; another solution that worked well, I'd like to hear it.


The orange high heat RTV might work. But I'd get some aluminum tape (listed
as bumper repair tape at my FLAPS) instead. Or JBWeld if you never want to
touch them again.

Sorry, can't help with the flappers or connections. I haven't messed with
those yet.
