Subject: Re: [T2] 1960's Fringe Around Windows

As a groovy dude, with 6&quot; fringe in the double cab, and a more modest 
2&quot; fringe along with tri-colored dingle balls in the bus, I feel      
qualified to answer this one. Any local fabric or upholstery shop     
should be able to help you with that; just pick your color. Of course,
if you want the more fancy, pre-made ones, there are lots of tiendas  
that cater to the local latino population and their automotive        
customizing tastes which will carry the fancier stuff. Not sure what  
it's offically called, though...                                      
&gt;                                                                     
&gt; I cant seem to find this on the net What is the name of the fringe
&gt; (tassels maybe?) which hung from the ceiling (windshields) in       
Southern                                                              
&gt; California cars, 1960s &amp; 1970s?
