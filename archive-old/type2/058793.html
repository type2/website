Chris:

Just read your tale of woe, and man it sounds like you got the big problem
we all dread; complete teardown.  I sympathize.  As a minimum, you're gonna
have to get the lower end reworked, crank, rods, bearings and possible an
align bore.  Doesn't seem like this should have happened after only 10k
miles though.  Who did your rebuild??  You said ATK.  I hope you didn't
mean AVP 'cause I just bought a rebuild there...anyway.

Since it is still running, I'd start off by doing a compression check
before you tear it apart.  With 10k miles, you should have good compression
(above 115 psi) provided that the heads/pistons/cylinders aren't damaged.
If compression checks out OK, you might not have to replace these items
which could cost $600-800.  You'll know for sure when its torn apart.

&gt;From your description, it sounds like it might be a warranty item.  If the
bearing was installed improperly, its likely that the engine would have run
hot from day one..did it?  I did this once years back in my old beetle.  I
installed no. 3 bearing wrong and there was a slight resistance in one
spot.  Being in high school and my first rebuild, it didn't seem too bad so
I let it go.  When I got the engine running, it always ran hot.  It lasted
several thousand miles until it melted down on a long trip, with exactly
the same symptoms as yours.  In my case, the pistons,cylinders and heads
were OK and I reused them.  If the failure you had was due to just running
hard and overheating the engine, you're probably gonna have head damage
(cracks, dropped seats) or damage in the cylinders (scoring, scuffing)
IMHO.  If thats the case, ya might have some trouble on the warranty.

Labor is gonna cost you some bucks here since the whole damn thing has to
come apart.  You can save a bunch if you tackle it yourself or with
assistance by someone mechanically inclined.  That along with a few
mistakes is how I learned, and it really wasn't too hard.  You'd come out
with a better understanding of your bus also.

Best of luck
