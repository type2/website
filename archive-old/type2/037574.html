Subject: Westy dome light switches

Volks:

I searched the archives with wildly varying results, so excuse the
fodder at the end of this message.

Both switches on my dome light(over the table) are
malffunctioning/missing pieces.  Anyone know where to find these parts? 
I need the 2-position push button switch with the lock nut and the 2
position twist switch with the knob (or whatever was on there).

thanks
