&gt; I'm looking into the underside of the front driver's side wheel well, and

&gt; rubber snubbers on it.
&gt; 
&gt; The rust is in an S-shape, starting in front of that post, running down under 
&gt; it and then curving around and under the lower torsion tube &quot;mouth&quot;. Only 
&gt; about 15% of the lower tube has solid metal around it.
&gt; 
&gt; Is this something that can be repaired with weld while in place? What is the 
&gt; best fix?

best fix is a new front tube, but that is a royal PITA to change out and
finding a good one can be some work.

a &quot;GOOD&quot; welder can fix em with a bit of work without removing them.  This
is a job I take to a professional welder.  that being said, I had mine
welded up about a year and a half ago to hold me until I get the time,
money and whatever to take my bus (daily driver) out of service for a
major front end job, I will probably put in new or rebuilt steering box
and maybe brake booster, also will rehab the entire front suspension and
brake system to boot.. in other words it is a major project
