Aha!  I see it now.  I somehow missed the jumper between S9 and S8.

Thanks, Richard!

I guess I'd better re-inspect S9 to make sure it isn't popped.

Is S9 supposed to be an 8-amp or 16-amp fuse?  Bentley doesn't say.  
Page 4-5 has a sketch that suggests S9 is 16-amp, but then says that 
the slots that take a 16-amp fuses &quot;varies among model years&quot;.  It then 
refers me to the vehicle's owner's manual, which I don't have.
