&gt;        If getting a good T4 case proved all that difficult, I'd be
&gt; looking at sticking Subaru or some other watercooled engine in my westy.

Welllll, a couple of friends who are hardcore RX-7 nuts showed me
an article about some commercial kit that will put an RX-7 rotary
engine into a loaf!  Sorry, I don't have the article any more but
it looked pretty slick!
