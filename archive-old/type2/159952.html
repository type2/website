&gt; When I was in junior high, many, many years ago, a friend of mine and  his
&gt; dad built an airplane with a VW motor in it.  I don't know for  sure, but
I'd
&gt; bet it was a pancake.  I ran into him at our 25th  high school reunion and
&gt; he said that he still has the plane and  occasionally flies it.  Wonder if I
&gt; could just strap some wings to  the Bopmobile?  Cheers....KR

A quick Google thru VW-powered aircraft shows that although it's a VW engine,
it's not &quot;just&quot; a process of replacing the flywheel with a propeller adaptor
