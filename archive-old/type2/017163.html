Subject: ID: 30 amp vs. 38 amp

I've got a generator I'd like to identify.  It's got the VW rebuilt
sticker with part # 113 903 031.  The housing UNDER the sticker
identifies it as a 30 amp unit; but it came out of a '71, and is mounted
on the 38 amp style fan.  The bus it came out of has an aftermarket
regulator that doesn't indicate amperage; so I'm down to the VW part
number as my best clue, I think.
