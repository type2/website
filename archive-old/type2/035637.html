Subject: Stepped feeler gauges

Volks, Nikki was the one who mentioned the stepped or &quot;go-no-go&quot; feeler
gauge.  This is because I favor them and gave her my spare when I did her
valve adjustment.  The gauge I use is made by KD tools.  The part number
is 2424 and it *should* be available on the KD rack at your local FLAPS,
but if it isn't a quick search of the net turned it up at this site:
