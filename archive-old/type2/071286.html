Consumer advocate groups tell you  that you don't &quot;need&quot; lots  of things. You
may not &quot;need&quot; higher octane, but if you take the time to tune your engine for
the gas you are going to use, it will be worth the effort. My experience  has
been I can get anything to run on regular, but performance will be lackluster.
Tuning for the higher octane makes noticeably more power. If you  think your
big lumbering bus doesn't need any extra boost, retard the spark and fill it
with 87. Personally. I'll take the 93 octane and keep up with traffic. (only
my opinion)...Johnny
