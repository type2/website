Subject: Re: [T2] Radio block-off plate

&gt; For the purpose of temporarily covering the radio cavity in the dash of my '70

&gt; year.  Has anyone seen one of these or successfully made one that looks
&gt; stock?

I took the shroud from a dead underdash A/C unit and cut the material to
fit the opening, also the ashtray opening too since I put my eberspracher
heater controls there.

matches almost perfectly
