Try to find a '73-'79 donor bus in the junkyard or maybe an old =
Squareback or Fastback Type 3, and borrow the top hatch and a hand's =
width of surrounding metal from it. You could use a cutting torch or a =
Sawzall. Then cut a hole in the deck above the engine in your bus and =
weld the donor hatch in place.

R.D.
'79 bus

Has anyone tried or know someone who has tried to put a hatch over the =
engine in one of the earlier bays?  My 72 doesn't and it was suggested I =
tried this.....now, before I start looking for a lid to put into =
it...does any have anything to suggest or to take into consideration...?
