Subject: Re: knocking rear end

I went through a similar noise in the Burrito Express ('70 Dormobile).  The 
noise was a very loud ban that was related to wheel rotation and would come 
and go with changes in speed.  The CV joints were fine.  Turns out the 
bearings in the carrier were bad.  The replacement process was 
straightforward though messy.  It's in Bentley and there's others on the 
list that have been through this.

 &gt; I can hear a pretty bad knocking noise from the rear left ( if looking
 &gt; from behind) of my 72 bay.  It seems to be coming from either the
 &gt; wheel or the rear wheel shaft but I'm not sure as it only happens
 &gt; when driving along.
