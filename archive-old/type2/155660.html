Subject: Re: [T2] Bus No Start -- Me Very Stumped

Travis, you're right. This really sounds like a battery/charging issue.

Here's what I'd do from where you left off:

-Disconnect wiring to second battery
-Disconnect and clean both ground straps at both ends then reconnect
-Install (temporarily) a known good battery in the bus
-Perform Bentley test on double relay

At this point try to start it again. Don't trust the FLAPS battery test or
charge.
