Subject: A little (heater) relay help!

Hi All,
     It's Sunday and I'm trying to get my heating system to work.  I can't 
seem to make the blower motor go.  I've got juice flowing back there as far 
as the relay.  The little red wire with the fuse goes into the block that 
plugs onto the relay has power, but the yellow &amp; brown (I think brown) wire 
that goes to the heater blower connector is not lighting up my test light.  
Does this mean the relay is kaput, is there a way to test the relay? Is 
there something else I should look at?  Is there another wire going into the 
relay that should have juice?
     Also, is there a source for these?  I checked the FLAPS website and 
couldn't find it, should I actually go there and see if it's on the shelf?  
Does Radio Shack have an equivalent?  I checked BusDepot and can't find it 
in the catalogue or by VW part number (211 963 141).  Any help is 
appreciated.


Thanks,
