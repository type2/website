Subject: Re: [T2] hot air tube under the bus

&lt;&lt;Type B gas vent material (double wall vent connector, galvanized
exterior, aluminum inner liner,&gt;&gt;

Great concept--good idea.

The weakest point of that particular double wall tubing ( flu ) is the
galvanized outer shell.

It'll rust up faster than molasses on a 100 degree day.

Now, if you had a single wall steel tube      ( with decent wall
thickness ) and had it ceramic coated by Ole Stan Wilder the rusting
factor would be cut down to a minimum, ( or maybe even zip ) and the
bonus plan here would be that the tube would be more apt to hold the
heat till it got up front of the Bus, without any added insulation.

I like the concept----clean and simple.

Where's the master of disaster Stosh been anyway?

Haven't seen or heard from him in awhile.
