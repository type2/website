&gt; 
&gt;      My new '69 which was maintained by the VW dealer burnt it's valves in
&gt; 25,000 miles. And I hate to think how many times it was rebuilt after that.
&gt; I recall one alignbore and one new case among those. Your above mentioned
&gt; parts hauler probably never left the city. Mine was mostly highway,
&gt; pedal-to-the-metal 90% of the time, with a heavily loaded vehicle --- that
&gt; just burns up a too-small engine. Any engine that is run full-throttle most
&gt; of the time will live a very short life, even big Detroit rron. With a T4
&gt; 2.0L in a bus you can run 3/4 trottle and still make the speed limit most of
&gt; the time.

That almost mirrors my experience exactly! I bought a 70 from a
junkyard- had to get an Alabama title, got the key and the owners manual
from the PO. It had 115k miles on it then. One day #1 owner stopped me
and told me he had bought the thing new, put white pinstripes on ONE
side only, so he knew it was his old bus. Seems this bus had been from
Iowa to Alaska 4 times, now on its 4th engine. Failures had been a
variety of things, but a couple of broken crankcases. The then current
engine was a German case, 1641 cc, single port,and it was a good one, I
finally took it out at about 80k miles only for excessive endplay. I
think the owner in between us had probably not changed the oil very
often. We used this motor hard. My brother took it to a Porsche swapmeet
in Pennsylvania, said he had the speedometer needle pointing STRAIGHT
DOWN going down some of those mountains! (It did read high, but that was
still pretty fast.)
I would be really interested in stories about long lived motors,
including:
1. How long they lived
2. How hard they were loaded, driven, city, highway , desert,etc
3. How they were built- size, oilcoolers, intake, exhaust, cams,
rockers, valves, etc
4. How they performed- I know that's pretty subjective, but isn't it
all?
5. What kind of maintenance you gave them
