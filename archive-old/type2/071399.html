Subject: Finally found a bus(I think)
Content-type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII
Content-transfer-encoding: 7bit


I think I have finally found a bus. It is a 71 bus no motor. Rust free has a
couple dents at bottom of nose. They guy who has it now says it had an hi-
performance motor. I don't know what kind was in it. He said it had an IRS
transaxle. Is this going to make it hard to find a motor?Is this a plus? How
can I tell what kind of transaxle is in it? Any help would be greatly
appreciated.
Regards,
BillM
