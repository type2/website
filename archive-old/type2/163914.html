Subject: '71 steering box nightmare

Okay.  Have had bad (loose, noisy) steering box since 11/04.  Bought a used
one from a listmember (who shall remain unnamed for the moment) but the
actual replacement didn't make it to the top of the list until Monday.
Against my better judgement, and primarily for lack of a garage and for lack
of confidence that I'd be able to actually accomplish the procedure, I took
my Bus to Wagenschmitt to have the transplant done.

Turns out that the &quot;new&quot; used steering box was worse than the old one!

Then, the conversation went like this:

Me: &quot;Oh.  I suppose I'll have to send my old one to Redding and get it
rebuilt.&quot;

Mike: &quot;I hadn't realized that you were planning to rebuild that one.&quot;

Me; &quot;Well, I wasn't, because it costs more than $300, but obviously I need
to.&quot;

Mike: &quot;Problem is I cut the old one off.&quot;

Me: &quot;You WHAT?&quot;

Mike: &quot;Otherwise, I would need a special puller to get the pitman arm off.&quot;

Me: &quot;You can't be serious.  I know I could have bought a puller that would
work.&quot;

Okay.  So, obviously, I'll be doing this job myself next time, even if it
takes me a week in the middle of the street.  Currently, the only pitman arm
puller that I own is the sub-$10 Harbor Freight model; does anyone have any
experience with that?  (Does it fit?  Does it work?  Does it break?)

Does anyone know of a SPECIFIC pitman arm puller that actually works?  There
are an awful lot of them available online for less than $50 in various
shapes and sizes, and that's a heck of a lot less than the $150 core value.

If I ever contemplate taking my Bus to a professional mechanic again for
anything other than a brake job, someone slap me.  Last time I was out $450
plus the cost of a weekend van rental for no benefit (the generator that he
installed failed, twice, and I ended up doing the alternator conversion
myself anyway)... this time, I'm out about $285 ($135 labor plus a $150 core
charge).

Anyone want to buy a '71 Bus with a strong 2002 engine and new Hankook
tires?  (I only think I'm kidding...)
