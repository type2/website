Subject: fuel tank CRUD?
Message-ID: &lt;19991103134003.55076.qmail_at_hotmail_dot_com&gt;

David, I have a fuel tank that I pulled from a very nice '77 (FI tank).  I 
looked down through the top sensor hole, and this is what I see!

There is a 'square shaped bowl' that covers the inlet/outlet pipes for the 
gas lines, inside the tank.  It IS NOT flat inside the tank!!

This square bowl is about 5&quot; square, and about 3&quot; tall/deep and open on top.

There is one hole at the bottom of the bowl, right at the bottom of the tank 
that allows the fuel into the square bowl if you have less than 3&quot; of fuel 
in your tank.  The hole is about the size of a nickel.

I could only see one of the inlet/outlet pipes, and is is flush with the 
bottom.  I imagine the other is also flush with the bottom, but without a 
dental mirror, I could not tell.

This square bowl must allow the fuel unimpeded access to the two in/outlet 
holes, so if you are going up or down a steep hill with just a few gallons 
left in the tank, some fuel will be captured in the square bowl and the fuel 
will not simple migrate to the front or back of the tank, leaving the holes 
'high and dry', so to speak.

(Important: the hole is middle of square bowl, toward the right of the bus.  
Hole is not in the front or back of the square bowl. That would be a dumb 
thing to do, as it would only prevent fuel starvation on either going UP a 
hill, or DOWN a hill, and who wants to have a dead engine on either 
occasion!!)

If you have any 'crud' in this square bowl, and it is a sinking type crud 
thing, it will probably cover one of the two holes on and off, but pretty 
much constantly. The crud could have gotten in the square bowl from the hole 
on the bottom, or from the wide open top of the square bowl.

Guess you would have to pull the tank and shake the crud out, IF YOU HAVE 
ANY crud.  (Your question was 'How can I find if I have any crud' or 
similar, and my opinion is that you CANNOT find if you have any crud without 
looking, which probably means pulling the tank.
