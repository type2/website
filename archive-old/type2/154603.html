Subject: Re: [T2] Why is my 77 Westy running so cool???

I picked up a cover from a shop this week and the guy that I got it from mentioned that I didn't actually need it, I can't see how the thermostat 
could get any heat around it without it, I will be using the sheet metal when my 
new thermostat arrives this coming week.

Its like blowing on anything, if you have wind passing over it the heated air 
around it will get replaced with cold and the cold air will keep sucking the 
heat out of the thermostat.

I have no proof in this particular case and I have never tested it but I can 
fall back on the fact that VW designed the thermostat to be behind the cover.

. No wonder I'm not getting any 
&gt; heat into my cab. I have a thermostat installed, but NO under pushrod tube 
&gt; sheetmetal on. The thermostat appears to work fine, but man that engine is too 
&gt; cold which is not good for sludge and varnish etc.
