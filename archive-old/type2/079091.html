Subject: Engine woun't start

    Hello Volks,

Today i've finally putted the engine of my 1969 bus in it's place after
assenbling new cilinder's, pistons, valves and guides and the only problem
fonded after spending allloooooottt of time working in it, it simply doesn't
start. I've been looking in the archive but i'm having problems with it. I
suspect it is an timing or mixture problem. What is the best way to set the
timing just right and that mixture is good ot what else could it be?
