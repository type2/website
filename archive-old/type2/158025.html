Subject: Re: [T2] 2000cc rebuild!!!

&lt;&lt;if you want the maximum reliability and power then it is almost
mandatory that you put the fuel injection system back into the engine.&gt;&gt;

Reliability?

Nothing can be more frustrating than a non fuctional AFC system---

If you enjoyed being towed when the system decides to mafunction then
injection is the way to go.


&lt;&lt; Carbs may look nice but you can believe that VW didn't go to fuel
injection because it was easier or cheaper, but because it was what got
the most out of that engine. also better MPG too.&gt;&gt;

You can't possibly beat the simplicity of the carbs and a set of points.
Yea, you'll get a metered amount of fuel att he right time, and possibly
get better MPG---
But a good running carbed engine can and will have as much power if not
more as the squirted engine.

I'd much rather dial in a set of points and condensor once a year than
to be pulling my hair out trouble shooting a messed up AFC system when
it quits, and put me on the shoulder of some back road in Podunk
Nebraska.
