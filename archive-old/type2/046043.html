Subject: RE: [T2] Auxilliary air regulator

&gt;I am trying to get the auxilliary air regulator to work in my 78 westy.
&gt;There is no voltage at the connector.  From the diagram it appears that
&gt;it takes its current from pin 35 in the ECU.  It flows through the AAR, 
&gt;then to groung through terminal 88c of the double relay.
&gt;My question is:  Does pin 35 simply supply 12 v all the time, or is it 
&gt;a timed thing done inside the ECU?
&gt;I believe my harness has a short in this wire.  If all 35 does is supply
&gt;12v, can I wire 12v from the coil to the AAR, instead?

My knowledge is with d-jet FI rather than l-jet like the buses all have, but 
the aux air regulator is common between the two systems.  There should be 12 
volts supplied to the aux air regulator all the time the ignition is turned on.

I would NOT direct-wire it to the coil except to test its functionality!  
That's just a quick way to burn up an perfectly good coil.

Use a voltage meter (or a 12v light bulb) and check for voltage on the 
appropriate wire on the harness (with the engine running).

The aux air regulator will work even without the wire hooked up to it.  It just 
takes a little longer for it to close.  When wired up, it should take less than 
5 minutes for it to close completely.  Without the wire, you'll have to be 
driving for 15-20 minutes before the heat transfered from the engine case gets 
it hot enough to achieve the same thing.  This just means you'll have a high 
(2000 RPM) idle for a short while.
