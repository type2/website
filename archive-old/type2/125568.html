Subject: Re: [T2] Painting Engine Tin

I'm not sure how hot it really gets, but I'm painting up my tin (white so I can easily see leaks and stuff) in High Temp (1200 degree) paint that I found at NAPA. Says you can use it on exhaust componants and stuff. So I sandblasted and it's lookin' pretty good. 

I wouldn't use the BBQ paint though. It's porus and will let water and air get down to your metal and rust it. Think it mighta' been on this list somewhere that I read that. :) 

Cheers
Chris


&gt; So, my question to The List is, what type of paint did you use?  I would 
&gt; imagine that some hi-heat paint like Rust-Oleum's BBQ paint would work well, 
&gt; but does it come in colors other than flat black?  I'm running an 
&gt; aftermarket exhaust and the tin behind (FIF) the fan gets pretty hot, and 
&gt; I'm sure it gets hot enough to burn off regular rattle-can paint.
