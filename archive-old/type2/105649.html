&gt; Thought that I'd post an update on the current T2 projects that we're
working on...

Left one out...

- `77 Sliding Door Inside Handle(Part# 16-19): Forgot about this one until
my son tried to get out of the back!  The master (rebuilt handle that
&quot;exploded&quot; when I put too much force on it) is just about ready for the mold
process.

The handle will be all resin (replacing the metal core) and is completely
solid, not hollow at the mounting end like the original.  It's been modified
internally where the screw goes through it to increase the strength.

I'm going to cast the one for Giacomo in bright orange just to make it more
visible (yeah, weird, but I love the color orange).  The production handles
may be either gray or black, though a variety of colors will be available.

On another note, are the little plastic screw caps that cover the screws
that hold the interior panels still available from any where?
