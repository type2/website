Subject: Field Testing Results

So my wife Jo and I got back from our trip to Maine in the '78 Westy and all
the backlog of work is caught up.  Now it's time to post the results of
field tests for some of the new products we used.

1.  aircooled_dot_com's external oil cooler, with fan:

Worked well, but I had to scramble to find local hoses and fittings due to
some kind of clerical mix-up at their end.  Despite a lot of additional
expense and hours spent driving from speed shop to speed shop, I found
everything I needed in time for the trip.  It kept the oil temperatures
hovering around 240 degrees, a huge improvement over my normal oil
temperatures, despite 90+ outside temperatures.  Now if I can figure out why
the stock cooler is not functioning...

2.  Bus Depot super-big Brazilian Bus mirrors:

HOOAH!  I love these things!  There is a minor problem with the passenger's
side, the adjusting nut is too loose and the mirror shifts when the door is
closed hard.  Correcting this means yanking off the glass which I didn't
bother to do on the trip.  Lots more visibility and pretty neat looking,
too.  I felt like a Big Rig driver with these babies!!!  I noticed they
closely resemble late-model Jeep Wrangler glass...  Perhaps the rights-side
convex mirror will fit these housings?

3.  Koni Adustables, B-D Special:

Love the ride.  Flat out these are great shocks.  I think I need to ratchet
up the rears a little more however, as a misreading of a setting suggestion
lead to the rears set at one-half of a turn, not 50% of total adjustment.
This may have bearing on...

4.  Hankook tires 185CR14

Quiet, comfortable, but scary as hell in a cross wind or in defensive moves.
At one point driving a congested Interstate in Connecticut, I had to make a
sudden lane shift to avoid highway debris obscured by traffic.  I though the
rear was going to tuck under a la my old 1961 Beetle with swing axles.  This
very well may be related to Item 3, the settings of the Koni Adustables.
Future reports will be filed!

5.  Bus Depot Underdash Tray:

Overall I liked this item.  There are a few problems to be considered
however.  First of all, the unit interferes with the heater control cables.
The floor/windshield cable was displaced and popped-off its mount during
installation, losing the spring that keeps the flap in place in process.
Secondly, the cup holders on the outer edges are made only for standard soda
cans; taller beverage cups (e.g., McDonald's) do not fit.  Use B-D's ashtray
units instead!

6.  Reproduction Spun Aluminum Cups/tumblers:

These were offered on eBay last year at this time.  The guy who made them up
was very disappointed at the low demand for them.  But they are fantastic!
They are just the right size for a cool drink at the park (or a nice double
shot of your favorite liquor) and &quot;are so old they're new&quot; with their
colorful appearance.  Too bad they did not catch on more.

7.  High-torque starter for VW 3-speed automatic:

I forget where I got this gem, but I had it installed last winter by the
local a/c Porsche garage (German Auto) (they really got a kick out of the
Westy BTW).  This thing is awesome.  Sounds and starts like an American V8
:-)

8.  New ball joints and steering crank bushings with alignment:

Mickey's Alignment in Broomall, Pennsylvania, did a nice job installing
these items on short notice.  Tightened up the whole front end.  Rides like
a new car with this, the Hankooks and Konis.

Other Lessons Learned:

1.  Keep an eye (nose) on the propane lines.  I was not careful in shutting
off the LP and highway driving seems to have sucked some of the gas into the
passenger compartment via the stove top.  This stuff stinks.  I spent hours
looking for what I thought were gasoline leaks before I figured it out.
However, I found a few genuine -- but small -- gasoline leaks anyway.
Please, please, please, thoroughly inspect your gas lines, petrol and
propane, each season!

2.  I left the refrigerator on one night while we stayed in a B&amp;B.  Drained
the auxiliary battery dry (Exide marine deep cycle).  Charging it with the
alternator was a problem because the current flow melted fuses and relay
alike in the 12VDC and 120VAC circuits.  I ended up jumping the darned thing
as the on-board systems are designed to top off the battery, not charge it
from a state of deep discharge.  Next on my list to buy:  isolators and
low-voltage disconnects.

Otherwise, we had a thoroughly enjoyable trip and now my as-yet-unnamed
Westy has been from East Port on the Bay of Fundee in Maine to Southernmost
Point, Key West.  Maybe one year soon it will have to visit San Diego!
