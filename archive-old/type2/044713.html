Has anyone come across a sliding door, supplementary, rear, interior lock 
handle, to open the slidind door from the rear.

The appropriate components, for such a factory fitted option, appear to be 
illustrated in the 1968-79 VW Type 2 Official Replacemunt Parts Microfiche &amp; 
Catalogue, on Page 75, items 16 etc.

On the British &amp; European specificaton VW Westfalia Continental, the normal 
interior door handle, at the front of the sliding door, is obstructed by 
furniture, so the supplementary handle, would be very useful
