Hello all,

Found this on the Type 3 list, though it would be interesting to find out
what our Star Wars names would be.

&gt; For all the dark sides out there:

The Star Wars naming protocol has finally been cracked:

To get your star wars name : Take the last 3 letters of your surname,
 add the first 2 letters of your first name. This gives you your Star
 Wars first name.

Your second name is the first 3 letters of your mothers maiden name and
 the last 2 of the town in which you were born.&lt;

Have fun,
