Subject: CDI / Distributor Selection

Background:  Currently my bus is running a 71 DP engine.  Initially I 
was using the distributor from the original 68 SP engine with a 
Petronix, but the Petronix failed 30 miles shy of completing a 
cross-country journey.  So I put the 71 DP distributor (vac adv/ret) 
which has a leak in one of the vaccuum cans.  Since then I installed 
an 009 distributer that I had laying around (don't ask why the 
original 68 SP distributor didn't go back in with new points/condensor).

Anyway, I've been considering purchasing the Mallory HyFire VI CDI 
and a Mallory coil, and I was wondering what would the recommended 
distributor be assuming all 3 were in working order.  Which leads me 
to question 2 - can you fix the vaccuum cans?

TIA.
