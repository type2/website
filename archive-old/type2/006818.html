&gt; then are

I just check them.  If they off more than I want to deal with I adjust them, 
if I can, or return them for one that I can adjust or is accurate enough.  
Oil temp is a thermistor, so if it reads too high put some added resistance 
in the circuit.  Oil pressure is also a varying resistance so do the same 
thing.  And CHT is a voltage so again, add resistance if it's too high, get 
another one if it's too low.
I realize that this isn't a &quot;perfect&quot; solution, but it's good enough for most 
of us.
