&gt; Can you use the front tin from a 72 to 74 Beetle?
&gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; An excellent idea.  You will have to scrounge up a few parts, but most of
&gt; &gt; them are readily available.  Since VW did this themselves, you are assured
&gt; &gt; of a well-engineered design.  The only tough part is the front tin, which
&gt; &gt; was only made in '71.  Other tin can be modified without too much trouble
&gt; &gt; to do the job.
