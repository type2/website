Subject: Carb adjustment after rebuilding

Can anyone give me some tips and/or tricks to getting my carberators
adjusted after having rebuilt both of them? The carbs in question are off a
73 Bay window, with the 34 PDSIT-2/3 and 34 PICT-3 carbs. I tried to get the
various adjuster screws back about where they were (counting the turns to
get them out and then re-installing them that many turns), and she's going
to visit a professional mechanic to get them tuned just right on Monday, but
I'd like to be able to drive her down there. Any help is appreciated!
Vielen dank~
