Chris:
&gt;Well, it's either an 1800 that had twin carbs originally, or a 2000 &gt;that had AFC FI originally, it's conceivable that you have a 75 with an &gt;1800, but it must be a real early 75, since all the 75s I've seen had &gt;the FI system and 2000 motor. Check your chassis and motor number.  I don't agree. I think all US spec 75's had 1.8 afc injected motors. Also, California model 74's apparently had afc (though this was a real mongrel sharing few parts w/1975 49-state versions). 75 and 76-79 motors
both are listed at 70ps (I guess that's a European horsepower rating
similar to DIN and SAE(net))- they acheived it through different means,
the 2.0 having smaller valves and lower compression ratio, if I remember
correctly.
&gt;Anyway, I just when through this after rebuilding a 71 FI 1700 from a &gt;sedan for use in my 73 bus. I'm trying to make a holley progressive and &gt;an 009 work together in harmony. I've found some comfort running with &gt;the timing set at ~6 btdc at idle. Make sure your points are within &gt;range first.This setup isn't perfect, because the van idles at 1450 &gt;-I'd like it to be 1,000, but so far - no luck.
I don't think it will ever work well, unless you're in Phoenix,
certainly not in the upper 49 state region. ther's a good reason VW
never made a single carb 1.8-2.0 and it wasn't just to raise the sales
price. 
Sorry to be the bearer of bad news!
