Subject: A good day in VW land and fuel hose needed

Today was a GOOD day in VW land. I drove my 71 single cab for the very first 
time (even if it was just around the block). I havnt got it taged and titled 
yet. I also cant get it to idle correctly. It idles VERY fast and after a 
few moments, just dies unless I feather the gas. No adjustments seem to help 
it, so I cant adjust the timing either.

I also NEED the fuel hose that goes between the filler neck and the neck on 
the tank. Its about 9 inches long if anyone has the correct hose. Right now 
I have a gas can with a fuel line running down to the fuel pump and thats 
not cool.

After fighting with my sterring wheel on my '72 HighTop camper for a few 
weeks, I took it down to a friend shop and used a HUGE SnapOn puller. Lots 
of  torque that was putting the SnapOn tool to the test and the wheel 
finally gave way. Now I have a nice sterring wheel, but the PO had tried to 
take it off and lost all 4 screws I need for the turnsignal switch.
