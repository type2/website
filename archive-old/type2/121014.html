Subject: Re: [T2] Alternator or regulator or something else

I had a little piece of paper in mine.  You know the little cap that's 
on the top of fuel injector cleaner bottles...  Well, it would nestle 
itself perfectly over the fuel inlet and cause the the car the run all 
funky, especially when the tank was low.  It was definately intermittent 
because sometimes it would be in the little cup inside the tank, and 
sometimes it wouldn't.

You'll have to pull the tank out to get it.  If you do, just drop the 
engine slightly, not all the way.  Also, I don't know if this is the 
same on yours, but on the firewall, there are two screws to unscrew it 
from the bottom under the car.  I spent a good 20 minutes trying to get 
it off until I realized there were two more screws ;)

Also, if you plan to take out our tank, you might want to get prepared 
and get some replacement hose for your filler tube.  I went to the 
marine store and bought some big fuel line tubing...  I think there are 
other spots to get hose also.  Another thought is getting the tank 
cleaned and/or cleaning it yourself.  You might find rust in there. 
This would also be a good time to change the fuel filler elbow.

Just some thoughts to be prepared for before you pull.  I always hate it 
when you do something and then realize you gotta do ten more things you 
didn't think of...

HTH,
mike

&gt; Hey Folks,
&gt; 
&gt; Having read all that is present in the archive and library, I am about to
&gt; embark on a diagnostic/remediation exercise on my '72.
&gt; 
&gt; Symptoms include:
&gt; 
&gt; battery runs down
&gt; brake warning light is dimly illuminated when the headlights are on (there
&gt; is a connection to the voltage regulator, according to the wiring diagram).
&gt; 
&gt; maybe related:
&gt; 
&gt; occasionally, near total loss of power (originally, I thought this was
&gt; ignition related and have replaced every ignition components and have
&gt; installed a pertronix system.  I now think it is electrically or fuel
&gt; related - maybe a intermittent fuel blockage).
&gt; 
&gt; My plan is to make sure all connections are clean and tight, perform voltage
&gt; checks, per Bentley, then to replace both the regulator and alternator.
&gt; 
&gt; If anyone has advice, it will be appreciated.
&gt; 
&gt; Really, I would greatly love to eliminate the intermittent power loss
&gt; problem.  If I do not find some electrical issue, I plan to yank the tank.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks,
