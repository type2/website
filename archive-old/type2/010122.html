Subject: Pedestal covering material

While looking for canvas at an upholstry fabric outlet (which I didn't 
find) I came across some pebbly black rubber stuff, an almost perfect 
match for the material glued, then torn and unglued, from the seat 
pedestals of my bus. Has anyone on the list tried to use this stuff to 
restore their pedestals? Seems like it would make them look spiffy-new, 
except for two problems. First, they obviously lack the OEM welt that 
slips under the sheet metal flange. And second, I have to wonder whether 
the stuff would be stretchy enough to make the curve around the top front.
