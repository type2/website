&gt;A)Restored Example
&gt;
&gt;B)Very Nice (not quite restored but very clean or
&gt;original nice condition)
&gt;
&gt;C)Daily Driver (clean but has a door ding here and
&gt;there or just a touch of rust)
&gt;
&gt;D)Beater (its rusty, dented, combo of both, people
&gt;look at you funny when they see its not abandoned-well
&gt;maybe not quite that bad:)

Well Wolfgang (our 1971 Wesfalia) is a cross between C and D.  Spray paint
primer on the outside.  One of the previous owners ripped out the whole
interior and built a Ham radio workbench.  Wolfie is used as a daily driver
and we have aspirations to bring him back to an A.  : )
