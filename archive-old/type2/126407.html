Subject: Re: [T2] fuel line hoses

I'm paranoid about fuel leaks. Seen too many car fires, VW , Ford,
Datsun, Chevy, etc...

When I had the shop replace the drag link on my bus they noticed a
small leak in one of my fuel lines. They offered to replace them for
$100! I bout died since it's 30 min of work and $15 in parts. But the
minute I knew about the leak, I couldn't bring myself to drive it home
to do the work myself. So I paid. Ouch. But I have all brand new fuel
lines.

I've got some steel braid line coming soon. Not cheap but the next
time I'm diving into the bus I'll be replacing the cloth braid with
steel braid. Still not perfect, but I fear friction. Same with the
brake lines...
