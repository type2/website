&lt;&lt; Greetings, gurus!

I am in the process of buying a 1974 Type 2
camper and hope you all
might give much-needed advice. &gt;&gt;

The early '74 models were dual carbed, and the later '74s from California 
were fuel injected.  You have an engine that has been converted to a single 
carb.  And yes, your 1800cc engine is considered a type 4.

Pick up a copy of the Robert Bentley service manual and the Idiot's guide.  
Several vendors on line have these books for sale, as should your local VW 
buggy shop.  They are both helpful in adjusting your valves.  

I suggest you find a reputable air cooled mechanic to evaluate this engine 
for you.  I am dead set against the single carb conversion kits.  Some people 
on this list (Marvin) will tell you how great this setup is, but if you live 
anywhere the temperatures get below 60 degrees, this setup is out as the 
manifold is not heated to keep the fuel from condensing before it reaches the 
heads.

If you are as unmechanical as you say, I suggest against buying a 26 year old 
vehicle for a 2500 mile trip.  You need to either have lots of time, 
patience, and cash to fix the little problems that may arise, or you need to 
take the time to learn how to handle these and at least learn the basics of 
you engines operation, before you attempt such a trip.

I've owned my '74 Campmobile for 10 years and I'm still learning.
