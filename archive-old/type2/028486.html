Clever fella you are ;-)  I like the modified cutter idea.  What do you use
for the crimpable cable ends and where do you get em?

&gt;[...] Anyone know where to find parts and/or tools for swedging?  I have to
&gt;make up some sunroof cables for a Type 3 Ghia using Porsche cables and need
&gt;to take the end off and reattach it.

Well not to get into it, but cable ends are just good ole crimped.
What you want to find is an industrial type hand held crimper, looks
like a set of cable cutters with 2.5' handles but has interchangeable
dies.  Used to make up aircraft cable style assemblies and commonly
for crimping large electrical connectors.  A good set can cost about
$300+ with only one type of die though.  Now there are also cheaper
things at Ace Hardware for crimping the connectors and stops onto
aircraft cable for garage doors and the like.  They are split half things
that you polt together.  They are harder to use, slow, and don't work
nearly as well.  But they might work for this.  I think you'll be OK with
