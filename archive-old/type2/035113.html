Tony in New Jersey asks:

&gt;If you were starting from scratch, which systems/units would you rebuild
&gt;first, then second, etc? Let's make it a two-part question: First, if it
&gt;were running- however roughly- and you needed it for transportation, what
&gt;would take precedence to keep you on the road with as little down time as
&gt;possible while still working on it and, secondly, what would be the
&gt;sequence, if you were doing a rebuild.

This is a fair set of questions, but difficult to answer because each 
combination of bus and owner is a little different with respect to the 
condition of the bus, the skill level of the owner, the money available, 
and the working conditions. Just to look at the last category, it makes a 
big difference whether you have a garage or not. It is hard to be a shade 
tree mechanic if you don't gots a tree.

Nevertheless, I think that some generalizations can be made that answer 
the question. Some of them are specific to buses, others will be true of 
any older vehicle.

There is so much variation between model years in buses that it is 
hopeless to try to talk specifics. But that's what the archives are for.

So here goes. Second question first.

If you have the time, money, skills, and space, then the thing to do is 
to get everything off the body, carefully labeling, bagging, and 
photographing each part and assembly. Clean the body thoroughly, weld in 
new panels as needed, get the body straight using as little filler as 
possible, prime and paint. Do not remove any more original paint than is 
necessary to do this. Add rustproofing and insulation. Then rebuild and 
reinstall systems in more or less the order they came off the bus.

Onwards to the first question.

Step one. Unless you know that the fuel lines were replaced with the 
correct sizes and pressure ratings of fuel hose yesterday, do it today. 
Take care in how you route the line through the front cooling tin.

Step two. Make certain that running and driving the bus does not cause 
damage. CV boots intact and filled with grease, fuel and ignition systems 
in a tolerable state of tune, no obvious rod knocking, not too much oil 
leaking. Clean the engine and engine compartment as best you can. Make 
sure all the cooling tin and seals are intact.

Step two point five. Take soap and water and a small brush to the seat 
belt webbing, or replace seat belts outright.

Step three. In a bus that is running and rolling, the most important jobs 
after replacing fuel line is to be sure that you can stop the bus, and 
that you can steer it. Brakes, steering, front suspension. Replace brake 
hoses, inspect pads and shoes, adjust rear brakes, check for adequate 
vacuum to booster. Replace brake fluid. Inspect steering joints for wear. 
Lubricate whatever can be lubricated. Have steering aligned.

If you have the time and the money -- and this is not too expensive by 
any means -- rebuild the brake cylinders, calipers, and master cylinder. 
Put on new pads and shoes all around. Replace most of the steel brake 
lines. The brakes in a bus can be brought to as-new condition for very 
little money and it's a good idea to do so. 

This is an example of where I part with the &quot;I paid $200 for my bus and I 
use it as a daily drive&quot; crowd. A complete reconstruction of the braking 
system can be done for as little as $300. Why would anyone not do this?

An essential part of the steering system is the rubber at the pavement. 
Check the tires -- tread, load rating, etc. -- and replace as need. See 
archives and library.

Step four. If the bus is running and you can steer and stop it safely, 
the next step is to make sure it doesn't rust away on you. Attack rust 
spots. Weld where needed, remove all the rust you can, paint with POR-15, 
get paint on metal, and rust-proof. Replace window seals if they are old 
and show signs of deterioration.

On a driver, step four can take a long time, perhaps a couple of years, 
so attack the worst places first and keep going.

Step five. Assuming that the engine still has adequate compression and 
you aren't hearing any strange noises, this is a good time to have it out 
with the interior. Fix seat springs, padding, and upholstery. Take care 
of floor covering. Get little missing bits squared away: the white 
buttons in the coat pegs, hangers for the seat belts, etc. Most people's 
impressions of the condition of a vehicle are strongly effected by these 
little visual bits -- including your own.

And while we're on the subject, keep your gasoline tank as full as 
possible at all times. This accomplishes two things. First, where there 
is gas there is no condensation, and therefore no chance to rust. Second, 
a half or more empty tank is the ultimate boom box: it increases the 
noise of the engine. 

Step six. Start building a replacement motor. See my &quot;12 months to a new 
motor&quot; buried somewhere in the archives.

Step seven. Painstakingly go over every inch of electrical wiring. Clean 
every terminal. I use dilute acid, flushed by water, to leave terminals 
bright. Put a little vasoline on exposed terminals. It's the rare bus that 
does not have splices in the wiring. If the splices are not soldered, 
take them apart, clean up the ends, twist, solder, and cover with shrink 
tubing. Check that no one has spliced in 22 gauge wiring where VW 
originally installed 16. Make sure there is no deterioration of insulation 
anywhere.

Step eight. Get your starter and generator or alternator rebuilt. If you 
are in a city of any size, there will be a place that can do this in 
three hours or so. 

Step nine. Get Bulley with your heating system. See library.

Step ten. When you get done with step six, drop the old motor and put in 
the new. At some point you will want to tear down the old motor to 
inspect and see what's what. But in general you just want to store it as 
a backup. Check clutch parts and go over exhaust. Pull the gas tank, 
clean it out, maybe have the tank recoated inside.

Step eleven. Get your fuel and ignition systems in perfect tune.

Step twelve. Replace wheel bearing if worn, replace clicking CVs, repack 
bearings and CVs.

Step thirteen. Go back to step one.
