Subject: Cracked Reservoir

This may be a stupid idea - I don't know what the 68 setup is for this.  But 
from what I understand, the topic of much recent discussion is a 
cracked &quot;upper&quot; brake fluid reservoir which, by definition means that all it 
does is supplies fluid to somewhere else via a rubber hose.  Since this is a 
NLA, 1yr-only, very-hard-to-find-used item, why not just fit a later-model 
reservoir (or one from some other vehicle perhaps) and run a rubber hose down 
to the rest of the setup?

In my 73 the reservoir is under the drivers seat and has a hose that goes down 
to the lower reservoir that is mounted directly on top of the master cylinder.  
Seems like if I had to I could do the same thing - use any &quot;upper&quot; old 
reservoir and plump it to the lower one.
