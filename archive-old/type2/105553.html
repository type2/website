Subject: Magical self adjusting timing

71 Westy, 1600 DP, stock eveything.
I have noticed the past couple of days that the bus
was not running like her old self, lacking &quot;pep&quot;.
I had just replaced points, condensor, plugs, etc.
about a month ago, at which time I set dwell at 50,
timing at 5* ATDC at idle.
So in the parking lot this morning I hooked up the
timing light and found that somehow the timing had
magically retarded itself to about 10* ATDC.
What is the likely cause of this? Loose screw on
points causing dwell to change? Crappy points that
&quot;stretch&quot;. Or could it be a worn out or faulty vacuum
advance unit on the dizzy. The dizzy is the correct
205Q that I picked up at a swap meet, so it is mostly
unknown.
Peace, John Baker
