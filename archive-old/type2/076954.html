Subject: Vanagon seats - Erdman Avenue Maryland

I stopped by Erdman Avenue Maryland junk yard on Dec 6, Thursday PM.

There is/was a tan/brown '87 vanagon with EXCELLENT seats!!

Light tan, clean, bright seats . . . The front captain's chairs will fit the 
late bays thru most '91 vanagon.

More surprising is the EXCELLENT middle (2 people) and EXCELLENT rear (3 
people) seats!!

In 6 years of haunting junk yards, these are the best I have come across.

I now have -4- Vanagon captain's chairs, and my '78 and '72 are both on 
track for seats.  If I bought any of these, my wife would SHOOT ME!!!

Be advised, they may NOT be there next week!!  The Vanagon I got my current 
extra set of vanagon seats from a couple of weeks ago is GONE, so I was 
lucky at the time.  It only lasted a month!!

Somebody with a Vanagon or late bay really ought to pick them up.

PS.  According to the price list, the door handles should be just $5; and if 
you want to snag the key lock from the ignition, I will tell you where the 
key is hidden !!

A quick talker should be able to pick up the three door handles and ignition 
switch for a song! !  Or don't the vanagon people have the same problem we 
bay people have with different keys for different locks??
