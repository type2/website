this may sound dumb but are you sure they are not for a 
beetle?

&gt; Hi everyone,
&gt; 
&gt; Slough VW swapmeet today.
&gt; I found something I've been after for a while -- a pair of 
NOS
&gt; chromed split bus headlight surrounds. Great price. But 
now
&gt; that I'm home with them I notice the adjusting screws are 
in
&gt; different positions from the ones on my bus. My new ones
&gt; (they're Bosch) have screws at 6 o'clock and 9 o'clock. My
&gt; old ones have screws at 4 o'clock &amp; 10 o'clock.
&gt; 
&gt; Will the new ones fit? Why are they different? Is it a 
Bosch
&gt; vs. Hella thing?
&gt;
