Subject: Re: [T2] Nicknames

Hi Folks,

Few have mentioned the &quot;unofficial&quot; nicknames that we give our Buses, 
especially in times of distress.  Most of mine are unprintable on a family 
list such as this, but there are many to choose from.  Sometimes a 
particularly difficult Bus situation will result in very creative unofficial 
nicknames -- like the ones I came up with while stranded on US-50 at the 
Utah/Nevada border.  Fortunately these often-derogatory names are only 
temporary and are given up once the Bus's problems are solved.  Most 
nicknames are given out of love, or the Buses will give them to their owners 
in a moment of bonding.

On a more realistic note, Bus names are as varied as their owners, and have 
some sort of story behind them.  Check out Mike Visket's site at 
http://home.earthlink_dot_net/~visket/Type2/BusNames.htm to see just how many 
there are.  A Bus's gender is also determined by the owner, and those 
reasons are also as varied.

As for me, Sweet Pea was named by the previous owner because of the Sage 
Green (pea green) paint.  Even when they repainted her to a different green, 
the name stuck.  I figured that Buses were like boats, and changing the name 
would be bad luck.  So, she remains Sweet Pea.  I tell folks that she's my 
current love -- because I spend a lot of money on her, and I spend a lot of 
time on my back underneath her!  Perhaps there's a reason I'm still 
single...
