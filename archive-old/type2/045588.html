Hi,
	More grist to the mill!

 For best acceleration you keep the engine as near to peak power as you
can, shifting either side.
 For best economy perhaps you should shift either side of the torque
peak? That's where the engine is nominally most efficient. I think 
that there's a risk of lugging it, though- I don't like to open
the throttle much if I'm under about 1800-2000rpm, and the torque
peak for my engine (1970cc with stock dual solex setup) is at
2100, I think.

 ISTR that the rev-limiting rotors for bus engines are 4500rpm for
a type-1 but 5200 for a type-4. I regularly run my engine up
to over 50mph in third, which is well over 4000... As to what
a sensible redline should be: well, I disagree that 3800 is 
appropriate. I'd say at least 4500 is comfortable and would
expect a redline on a tach to be about 5000 (maybe a little
under) for a rev-limit at 5200.

Cheers,
	 W.
