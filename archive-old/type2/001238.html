&gt; In regard to your observation of only a few buses and most owners
&gt; being &quot;very stereotypical&quot;  . . . .

&gt; That those you saw are &quot;stereotypical&quot; (meaning pleasantly laid
&gt; back, one assumes?) would not surprise me in such a place, but

They looked like they got stuck somewhere in the sixties scene. Their buses
like they did not get much attention for many years. I did not talk to any
of them (just passed them by). They could have been very nice people but at
first sight they appeared a bit rough.

&gt; side, and I'd hate to think you went home under the assumption that
&gt; the only folks in America still driving buses are wearing love beads!
&gt; It's a BIG country, and marvelously diverse.

I know. I've been to California many times and saw lots of buses there. Many
of them in very good condition and driven by all sorts of people.

&gt;From a tourist point of view I also preferred CA over FL. The Orlando area
is not very interesting if you're not into theme parks (I was there for a
conference).
