it has been many years since I was in Germany and had a couple VW's while
there, therefore some of my information may be out of date, but

&gt; lights at the  turning-signals.   Do the amercan versions have these

&gt; that for me, or where I can get it.   Thanks a lot     Matthias    

I am not sure of the wiring diagram but that should be on the list.  if
you still have &quot;Town lights&quot; they are wired in the same place instead of
&quot;Town lights&quot; 

if Not then you would have to change the light switch because there is an
extra terminal on the American versions.   when it is pulled out, there
are two positions, half out -  parking lights, full out - headlights

this switch is avaliable from Rocky Mountain, Bus Depot and others.

I am not sure but I think the turn signal relay is also different.  
but get the wiring diagram first. this may be difficult because the wire
run may be different.
