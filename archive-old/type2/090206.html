&gt; I removed the engine from my 79 (78 FI engine) last

&gt; tubes, will the oil come pouring from the crankcase?

Well, it is certainly wiser to drain, and it can be a close thing but if
you have not overfilled the case and it is level (and it stays level while
you are working on it), then it will not spill.  I think you would still
be wiser to put the engine on blocks high enough to get pan under it and
drain it now.

&gt; Also, I thought it would be a great time to replace all
&gt; my fuel lines and injector seals.  What size line should
&gt; I look for and is it commonly available at the FLAPS?

I've had problems at the majors finding/buying metric lines[1].  They will
happily sell you &quot;something close&quot; which is *wrong*!  I think you would be
happier buying the right diameter line from a VWFLAPS or from one of the
list vendors.  While you are at it, buy (and insist on) FI clamps all
around as well.

[1] IMHO, this is INSANE of them!!  I make a point of asking for x mm line
and when they tell me don't have it I ask if that's because no one in the
US drive a foreign car but me.  I tend to make a bit of a stink, and hope
the rest of you will as well.  It is way too late in the day and we ought
to bite the bullet, ditch the US/Ugandan[2] measurement system and switch
to metric.

[2] That by the way is the total list of counties using inches, and the
Ugandans are changing fast.

(can you tell I'm feeling grumpy this morning? :-)
