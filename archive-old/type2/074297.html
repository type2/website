Subject: Re: [T2] SOLEX carbs  in a '72 camper

1972 bus: 1700 cc type IV engine, 34 PDSIT -3 and -4 carburetors.  They are
essentially 3 carbs, 1 for each side and one for idle.

I also have a 1972 stock 7 seater (blue/white delux) with this engine and
carb set.  I have rebuilt these with the kit that is available from several
vendors.

Fuel shut off electric valves for each side and for the idle circuit.

There are electric chokes on each side.

If anyone has an extra choke, I could use one, the connector broke off of
one of mine.

&gt; 
&gt; OK, I have some time on my hands here at work (is it obvious??) and I
&gt; started looking at a manual entitled 'SOLEX - Selection and Tuning of the
&gt; Carburetor'
&gt; 
&gt; Wow, neat pictures!!
&gt; 
&gt; Question:  what SOLEX carburetor comes standard on the '72 bus/camper, and
&gt; what years VW bus can this be found on??  (Sorry, still at work, and the '72
&gt; is rusting quietly at home.)
&gt; 
&gt; Oh, yes, if you (me, that is) take one apart, is it easy to put back
&gt; together??  I have two extra carburetors from a '70, one intact and one with
&gt; the choke thing taken apart.  If these are the same as on the '72, I would
&gt; plan to clean them up and replace the ones I have on the '72.
&gt; 
&gt; Hey, guys and gals, it IS friday!! Loosen up.
&gt; 
&gt; BTW, I saw a '68 in a mechanics back yard that has an extended/longer rear
&gt; view mirror.  It is screwed onto the overhead vice twisted in (completely
&gt; stock).  If you have an early camper and cannot see out the rear window
&gt; because your rear has dropped with age (or are sitting tall in the saddle
&gt; because you are 6'4&quot;), this mirror will let you see out the back.
&gt; 
&gt; I used a similar one on my '78, and it worked beautifully.  I don't know
&gt; what it would cost, but if it is excellent condition, I would go back for it
&gt; for someone who could use it.  I have ENOUGH junk in the house. The wife's
&gt; philosophy is 'if you haven't worn the clothes in the past 20 years, get rid
&gt; of it; if you are not going to use the VW part in the next 5 years, get rid
&gt; of it!!'
&gt; 
&gt; (((  But honey, I'm going to get back down to 165 lbs, so can wear that
&gt; cowboy vest with the fringes and spangles; and I do need to get that third
&gt; set of tires, just in case . . . .  ))
