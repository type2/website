Subject: Re: [T2] Timing gun issues...

You're right!  Sorry bout that.  I hooked it up that way and it worked right away.  Now I have a new issue....Where do I aim this blinking dot?  I know you're supposed to aim it at the scale (which I have to order, but for the time being I have one made of cardboard), but how/where exactly?  Thanks alot for your advice to a newbie.

Yes, it does. Read down on page 4:

Connect the spring adaptor and spark plug
lead between the spark plug (or distributor
cap) and the removed wire as shown in Figure
1. Route the timing lights spark plug wire away
from the exhaust manifold and surrounding
hot areas to prevent damage.
4. Connect the RED clip to the positive (+)
battery terminal.
5. Connect the BLACK clip to a secure engine
ground such as the alternator bracket or
engine block. For safety reasons, do not
use the negative (-) battery terminal or fuel
system components as a ground connection
point.
