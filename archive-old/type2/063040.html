You know, I always thought that one of the things that set us apart from the old
Soviet Bloc was that we could travel freely without worrying about random
searches and checkpoints from the cops (Papers, please...).  What a myth, eh?  

Still, I think its frightening.  Just for looking suspicious, can a cop hassle
you.
