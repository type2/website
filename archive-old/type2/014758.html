Subject: My new web pages are up and running!!!!!

Hello everyone.
  After many long hours I have finally got my new web page up. It is
completely different from the old site and has a slightly different address.
Please go take a look and see what you think. I still need to add some
better pictures of the 71 Westy and the Vert, but it is a start. And just so
you know, it was completely created useing only MS Notepad and a little
photo editing from Adobe photo shop 5.0. There is a nav bar that will take
you to the type 4 conversion page and one for the 71 westy, the other pages
are Bug and a for sale page with nothing on it currently. 
  Please let me know if something does not work right or needs correcting.
Today is its first day up and running.

Scott Solomon AKA &quot;VW addict&quot;
71 Westy
76 Triple White 'Vert
72 Super Beetle
