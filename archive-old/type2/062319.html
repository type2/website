So David Schwarze says:
&gt; 
&gt; and I'm broke.  Actually I was just kidding about not making it - I decided
&gt; several months ago that I would be attending BBTA come hell or high water.
&gt; If I let life's little problems influence my decision, I would never, ever,
&gt; EVER make it to Busses by the Arch, and that would be a shame.  Of course I
&gt; wouldn't ever kill someone for not feeling the same way, but I sure am
&gt; disappointed.

Yeah, right David.  The real reason that you're showing up is so you can
mooch parts from other Type IV engines behind the owners backs.  ;p

Har!!
