You don't need Wiring Works - just some time, A Bentley, and some good tools.

If you have to do any crimping go to the store and buy a good pair of cast 
iron crimpers - - - not the type that also strips the insulation and made 
out of recycled Chinese soup cans.

Mine is made by Dykes or Crescent (dunno which). They have long handles, 
look like long wire cutters, but the handles are color coded so you hold 
them correctly. Nearest the tip are snips, between that and the pivot are 
the crimper knurls. They make a very good crimp - permanent.

I saw some good quality ones at Lowe's and commonly see them at Electrical 
Supply houses. May cost you$15-$20. Sears should have them too. Stay away 
from cheap import combination snips/crimp/strippers from the FLAPS. They do 
none of the functions well - maybe except the stripper part. I use a simple 
utility knife and score around the wire where I want to strip the wire.

Buy some raw wire if you need to from an Electrical supply house. Just snip 
1&quot; off of the wiring under your dash that needs to be repaired anyhow to 
show them what you want. Buy several colors - yellow, black, white, red, 
etc. They sell it by the foot. Don't buy alot of wire unless you think you 
need it. Most of the crummy wiring I have had to replace required a few 
inches here and there or the P.O. simply cut a wire off short. I have never 
had to replace a whole harness except on a car that was the victim of a fire.

Buy some blue butt connectors, and some blue insulated female spade 
connectors. You can get them 50 or 100 at a time and in the long run they 
are much cheaper than $2 for 12 from the FLAPS. The connectors I see 
commonly at the FLAPS are covered with plastic, I prefer the ones covered 
in a vinyl. Seem to be more durable. The difference visually is that the 
cheap ones are opaque and the good ones are somewhat transparent.

Have the Electrical Supply store demonstrate the crimpers if need be.

Finally also buy a roll of vinyl electrical tape - your color choice. If 
you want to really do it right a piece of shrink wrap to cut into 3&quot; 
sections to shrink over any butt connectors would be worthwhile. Have them 
explain that as well. Tell them you are restoring a car or they may worry 
about the house you are repairing... &lt;grin!&gt;

Again stay away from FLAPS - they commonly carry the worst quality stuff at 
the highest prices. For a bit more money you get several times the amount 
of materials at a real Electrical Supply store. Every town has them.

Work on each circuit separately. Test each one after a repair. Any wire 
that gets hot is a problem. Also test each circuit to ground with a 
continuity test. With the lightbulbs removed from a turnsignal circuit 
there should not be any indication of a ground. With the lightbulbs in 
place the circuit will ground through them.

Does that give you something to work on?

&gt;Bentley manual has a good wiring diagram for your bus.
&gt;
&gt;Take each wire individually and chase it from it's source and to it's load.
&gt;I did this when I was adding relays to my headlight circuits. The
&gt;schematics make perfect sense after to learn to read them - color codes,
&gt;wire numbers, symbols, etc.
&gt;
&gt;Once I learned to read those schematics effectively it is easy to see that
&gt;the bus wiring is not too bad.
&gt;
&gt;I would be happy to correspond with you and head you chase the wires once
&gt;you get a copy of the schematics so we are looking at the same things. We
&gt;can do it on the list and everyone can pitch in here and there until we get
&gt;you straightened out. Don't pay anyone. Spend a bit of that same money you
&gt;would pay somebody on a decent light, a decent digital multimeter, and a
&gt;Bentley. When you get done you will be smarter, have some new resources
&gt;(tools), and you will hav &lt;http://health.yahoo_dot_com/&gt;Yahoo! Health - Feel
