Well, thanks for the replies about my question of which-terminal-does-what.  My
frustrations of not knowing which wires to play with are now at an end.  

Ironically, this is because it turns out that the PO *didn't* use monochromatic
black wire for rewiring the lights... but instead, wrapped all the wires in
black electrical tape.  

&quot;Why?&quot;  I don't know.  Maybe he was color-blind and figured *he*'s having
trouble, so everyone else should too.  :)  

Or maybe he was *really* depressed, and it wasn't enough to dress in black?  

Maybe he thought if he turned all the wires black, it'd be hard to hotwire? 
(Through the turn-signals?!)

Maybe it was a minimalist art statement?

Or maybe he was snowed in at Estes Park, and there wasn't a typewriter to type
&quot;All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy&quot; on, but he had this electrical
tape, so...

Lord only knows.  

Anyhow, the wires are now the proper colors that I recognize from my diagram,
and that makes my life infinitely simpler.  

Well, finitely, but still a lot.  &lt;:)  (Geez, tough audience.)

I'm still trying to track down my short, but now that I'm no longer lost in the
wilderness (other &quot;black&quot; wires have, in fact, turned out to be wires that were
very very carefully and anal-retentivally wrapped with electrical tape, with no
bubbles or creases to tip off an observer, and I'm starting to wonder about the
sanity of the PO), I think I should be able to figure this stuff out.  &lt;:)  

So I'm teaching myself to find shorts.  (They're in the top drawer, with my
socks.)  

Everyone should learn a trade, I guess.  I just wish there weren't so many
trades to learn before I can drive my car.  :P  

Hey, by the time I get Lazarus on the road, she'll be brand new!  I mean,
literally.  &lt;:)
