Subject: Re: [T2] RE: Michelin Agilis 51/61 Tires- Dis-Information

Another option in a D rating I found recently is the Goodyear
HT....still available, rated at 1710 lbs, but likely a little harsh ride
at full inflation....may be my next tire if I can get the pricing sorted
out...then again, my Continentals seem to drive and wear pretty nicely
too, and for about $50ea through Tire world on line, the pricing is
pretty nice...

Kumho has a D too, but I don't have any information on it...

Den.
