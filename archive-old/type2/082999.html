Subject: Anyone on Yahoo Groups READ THIS OR YOU WILL GET A LOT OF SPAM (No VW Content)

I went into my Yahoo profile and everything in here is true, 
all my marketing preferences were set for Spamming.

Thanks,
Chris

From another list I subscribe to... Rumour has it that it 
affects
Yahoogroups members.  You might want to check your 'marketing 
preferences'.

March 29 - Tired of spam you're getting at your free Yahoo! e-
mail
account? Get ready for more. Tucked inside a privacy policy 
change
the company made this week was notice that more Yahoo! e-mail
marketing offers were coming &quot;even if users had formerly 
indicated
they were unwanted. YAHOO! GRANTED ITSELF PERMISSION to spam 
by
creating a new &quot;marketing preferences&quot; page that lets users
pick &quot;yes or no&quot; to specific categories of marketing pitches. 
The
problem is, Yahoo! set every users' option to &quot;yes&quot; - even if 
long
ago, they indicated they never wanted any Yahoo! spam.

Users who don't want marketing offers from Yahoo have 60
days to do the following: Visit the user profile preferences 
page at
http://edit.my.yahoo_dot_com/config/eval_profile select &quot;Edit your
marketing preferences&quot; from within the Member Information 
section;
and individually change selections in a series of marketing
categories from &quot;yes&quot; to &quot;no.&quot;

In e-mail marketing lingo, the process is known as &quot;opt-out.&quot;
But even performing that slightly cumbersome operation is no
guarantee that Yahoo! marketing offers won't come, since the 
firm
reserves the right to add marketing categories at any time.

&quot;I'd suggest re-checking periodically,&quot; writes another
mailing list poster.
