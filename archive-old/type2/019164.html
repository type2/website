Whoops! I believe I meant for all of the below to be BTDC, not ATDC.
Sorry--what a pro! I don't quite have the hang of the
terminology yet.

Hi Friends--

I have a Weber 32/36 carb and a Bosch 009 distributor. I just installed
a pertronix ignitor, and I am wondering if I need to change the way I do
timing on my bus (there is a post in the archives which makes that
claim).

I have read that maximum advance on a 009 dizzy should be set to 28-32
ATDC, and that should coincide with about 8 deg ATDC at 1200 rpm (I'm
using a timing light). It seems like I've always used those specs.

Now that I've installed the pertronix ignitor, setting the timing at 8
deg _at_ 1200 rpm results in maximum advance _at_ only 24-26 degrees. I almost
wonder if the bus runs better that way, but I'm not sure if that is the
way to go.

1. What do I base timing on: the measurement at 1200 rpm or maximum
advance (or even idle--I don't have the specs for that)?

2. The pertronix ignitor shouldn't make a difference, should it? If so,
what?

3. If I should base timing on maximum advance, any opinions on what is
an appropriate range for setting it? Is 28-32 the only proper spec, or
does my other equipment figure in?

Thanks for the help--
