Subject: re: gas leak, 78, Need Advice

on one side of the van if you reach up the air vent your will find some
rubber tubing which connects two metal pipes. this is the evaporator which
i understand gets rid of gas if you overfill it. your leak is probably here.
i had the same problem a couple of weekends ago which pour about an inch of
gas into the left tray on my bus in the engine compartment. *whew* replace
it.
