&gt; &gt;Thanks Bob !
&gt; &gt;I only have 300 engines at this time :)
&gt; &gt;I am happy to help.
&gt; ======================&gt;
&gt; Hey,
&gt; Who knows?
&gt; Maybe some day I will QRO one of my buses to more Corvair HP.

I never really thought of my bus as a QRP rig, but now that I think of
it...

I'm wondering about the supply of corvair parts.  Do they have a healthy
aftermarket built up?  Does (gasp) chevy provide better support than VW?
