This is correct.

&gt;I say:
&gt;
&gt;I've gotta smog my 76 soon, and I'd like to know if this'll be the last time or not!

It's every two years and if you we're identified as a gross polluter (great license plate idea GRSPLTR ;-) you have to smog every year but that was repealed or so I read.

I was told by the smog referee that the test will depend on your VIN but I'm not sure how they calculate it, Karl?

Mine ends in &quot;0&quot;, and I did it in 2002 and they told me my next test would be in 2004. If it ended in &quot;1&quot; would my next test be in 2003 then every two years after that?
