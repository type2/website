My .02...

AAA has saved my sorry butt many a time since my good friends first
bought me a membership for christmas 22 years ago...

Get the gold that'll tow you 100 miles.  A whopping cost of about $80 a
year - you get 3 &quot;incidents&quot; per year - more at the same service level
for $35 each.

I can suck up $80 worth of maps alone on a good year.  Just walk in and
ask for all the maps you think you could ever need...  Any time you
want.  Share them with the many lost people you will encounter.
