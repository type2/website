Subject: Strange noise - right rear - 78 camper

A litle background: The vehicle is '78 Camper, 103,000 miles, PO was/is
litle old lady (owner for five years) and she had good (expensive) VW
service done, whenever she thought the '78 was not perfect.  Spent $2500
over the 5 years ownership.  I trusted the vehicle when I first saw it.
Still have belief in it.

In one year, I only drove it 3000 miles, and max of 120 mile trips.  Now, I
want to take it on a two week run through the Pocono Mts in Penna, US
Military Academy West Point, through Cape Cod, and then Atlantic City, ferry
across to Delaware and eastern Maryland/Virginia coast.

Looks like about 2000 mile!!

Last night, after adjusting the rear brakes (new shoes by yours truely) and
testing it around the neighborhood - 4 blocks - 5 medium hard stops, two
left turns at cul-de-sacs, it developed a clicking noise at the right rear
wheel area,

The click was very audible, and by letting it coast in the driveway, I
counted 3 clicks in one revolution (no gear, engine off = coast).

This morning, I jacked the right rear up, turned the wheel, and NO CLICK.
(similar NO CLICK when I adjusted the brake(s) yesterday morning.

Backed the camper out, NO CLICK.  Drove the camper (Westy) through the same
course, attempting the same speed and braking stops, and two left turns.  NO
CLICK!!!

I know, if it it ain't broke, don't fix it.  But I plan to take the camper
on a two week run this Thursday, and I would like a bit of advice on the
potentials for breakdown, and if it could be fixed *NOW* without a mechanic
hearing the clicks, if I could fix myself (I do brake jubs, oil change,
other minor nut &amp; bolt stuff).

Sorry, I am on DIGEST, so I wont hear/read any responses to the list until
late Sunday.

I live in Springfield VA (703 440 0448) E-Mail is PRAY4ME_at_EROLS.COM

(Many AirCooled VW people name their machine.  Since I named my HARD DRIVE
on my Pentium as 'PRAY4ME', I no longer have to do a low level format of the
drive.  Perhaps Pray4Me should be the name of my VW '78 Camper, also)

Off to Andrews AFB for shopping, and back to toe-in the wheel to 1/8
negative (I only have a HAYNES manual, just learning about Bentley and Muir)
