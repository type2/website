Hello Listees,

Karen and I had a great bus camping trip this weekend.  My friend and fellow 
listee, Pete Sottnik in Tulsa invited us to join the Tulsa VW club in a 
caravan to Prague, Oklahoma for their annual Kolache festival.  After the 
festival there would be a campout for those interested on the banks of the 
Verdigris river just east of Tulsa.

We met at a shopping center on the west of Tulsa at 8:30 Saturday morning.  
This meant that Karen and I would have to get up early to load the bus and 
make the hour drive down to meet them.

We got things ready the night before (oil change, wash job, air the tires, 
etc.) so all we had to do in the morning was throw the stuff in and go (yeah, 
right).  Anyway we arrived on time and even though we didn't know anyone 
there besides Pete, we were made to feel welcome and right at home.  VW 
people are the greatest!  There were ultimately a total of 14 VWs of all 
kinds including a NB, a Golf Cabrio, 4 busses (1 split westy, two bays and a 
Vanagon westy), several beetles, a Ghia, type3 station wagon and some others. 
 All in all it was a pretty good assortment of VWs spanning the years.

I was told that we would have a special parking place when we got there.  Boy 
was I surprised to find out that our group would actually be in the parade!  
It was pretty cool though.  The people of that small town really seemed to 
enjoy seeing the VWs (especially the busses).  After the parade we parked our 
VWs in a ropped off area where people could come and look closer at them.  
Sort of an impromptu car show. 

We enjoyed some food and beverage at the festival and then headed back to 
Tulsa for the campout.  Karen and I were first to arrive and so we picked a 
spot.  We were soon joined by others and we had five busses and the type 3 
wagon in our camp.  It was a pleasant evening with good food, friendship and 
VW talk.  We awoke to thunder and rain which quickly passed.  No problem.  
Pancakes and sausage for breakfast.  What a great campout!

The trip back to home was uneventful.  The bus ran great as we logged about 
340 miles for the weekend and got about 20 mpg overall.  Just thought I'd 
share my great weekend with you all.  Have a great week!
