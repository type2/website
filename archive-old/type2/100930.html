&gt; This seems like allot of effort to get a little brighter light. I am not

&gt; I am not a fan of these kind of modifications. Which usually only add insult

I just got back from the left coast and had a rental while out there, and
the fact that I was only doing 55 and had powerfull high beams was the
only thing that gave me the time to avoid the deer in my lane of the
highway.........sorry give me as much light as I can get without
blinding the guy coming the other way, and high beams that will cut the
night to the next county......

this is an interesting thread as I was considering the h4 mod before the
deer incident
