Subject: Side Mirror Removal

Can't find it in the Archive. Checked for &quot;Mirror AND remove&quot; and found
lots of stuff, but not the RIGHT stuff. 
 
The arm on my Mirror was busted off when I got the bus. The sleave where
the arm goes is sheered. I've got a new mirror coming from BusDepot one
of these days, so I went out to take off the old socket so I'de be ready
for the new mirror. I can't get it off though. 
 
The &quot;bolt&quot; is on the outside of the door. It's round, but has either
side shaved flat so you can fit a wrench over it. I can turn it, it's
hard, but it turns. I can KIND OF see the inside of the door where it's
spinning, but I can't tell if that's a bolt on the inside too or what.
No WAY can any of my tools reach in their to grab ahold of whatever it
is. 
 
So what is the propper way of removing the Drivers Side Door Rear View
Mirror on a 76 bus? 
 
TIA
Chris
