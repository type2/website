Well, I'd better make this a general post so everyone can hear it loud and clear.

A DP engine will seem sluggish if the valves are too tight. Certainly there are other causes, but this is what has most often plagued me.

A DP engine will seem more zippy if there is an intake leak (such as leaking boots in the heat riser-to-carb connection). Bob Hoover once explained this to me rather eloquently. The bottom line, though is that intake leaks are &quot;baaaad, very baaaad&quot; (say this with a George Bush on Saturday Night Live accent for Friday effect). &quot;Intake leak baaaaad. Dual port goooood.&quot; Hey, I'm working at home tomorrow, so today *feels* like a Friday to me.

Take care! Joe

&gt;I could not believe the difference in power between the DP and the SP.
&gt;All else is the same, except for clutch feel, etc.
