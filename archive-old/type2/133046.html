Subject: Re: [T2] Horsepower Numbers

David,

Uh-oh...now ya gone and done it....
It's gonna be a loooong horespower vs torque day.


http://vettenet_dot_org/torquehp.html

Yes, in a certain sense, horsepower accelerates a bus...because
horsepower is calculated from the rpm and torque numbers.


More torque, then your hp numbers are gonna be higher...same torque at 
higher rpm==more hp.

&quot;Horsepower sells cars, torque wins races.&quot;....wellll...maybe...

Read the tutorial above...takes a while to sink in, but it makes sense.
And don't skipp to the bottom before ya read the top!


Cheers, dave

&gt; With all due respect, it is horsepower that accelerates a bus, not 
&gt; torque.  If your engine is producing 30hp, it will always accelerate at a 
&gt; known rate (I'll leave the calcs to the physics guys).  If it is producing 
&gt; 80 lb/ft of torque, how fast will the bus accelerate?  Answer: no way of 
&gt; knowing unless you know the RPM of the engine at that point... and when you 
&gt; factor in RPM it becomes... HORSEPOWER.  :-)
&gt; 
&gt; I think you mean that the horizontally opposed T4 engine has relatively 
&gt; good low-end torque, which makes the engine perform better (i.e. more hp) 
&gt; at lower rpms than the peak hp would suggest.
