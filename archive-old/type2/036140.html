I should have pre-pre-pared for this. How 'bout:

If you want your name on the Bus Name list, email me at visket_at_earthlink_dot_net
and I'll be happy to skillfully sort your name into the list.

Also, if anyone has a more sophisticated &quot;sorted list manager&quot; where volks
can add their names on-line, feel free to use this as a starting point.
