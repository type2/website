Subject: Re: total advance?

As a shadetree mechanic, my understanding of total advance is:
the advance (in degrees) that the distributor obtains over the
timing at idle.  Practically speaking, look at the timing mark
at idle, rev up engine and watch timing advance.

They have fancy timing lights (called advance lights) which allow you
to do this with more precision then via the above method.  With these,
you note timing at idle, rev engine to specified rpm, then turn dial
on timing light to bring timing mark back to idle position.  By looking
at how far you had to turn the dial to achieve this, you have an
accurate determination of advance obtained at that rpm.

Don't know what this should be on a 009, but I'll bet somebody here
does!
