Hi Volks!

Don't you ever get yourself a second bus, they told me.
One is allright, but after you have to, they multiply.
Not quite as quicky as Rabbits do (which is why I sold
my first Golf the week I bought my second one, and never
parked them next to each other overnight), but they're
from the same family, so expect offspring soon.

And ever since I did buy my second Bus, they've been
getting more numerous -- and the pace is accelerating.
Took me a year to get to number three.  Half a year
to number four, and to get rid of number three, which
is in the Netherlands now.  I thought I was over the
worst.  Until this last Monday.

Only just a couple weeks ago it was a '76 Widebed Pickup
I harassed you with.  Today it is a '74 Kombi.

Somehow everyone around me seems to know I'm into Buses, 
even my employer's customers.  One of them, while we did 
some programming for them in the town of Delmenhorst, 
asked me if I needed another one.  My answer was my fate: 

&quot;Depends.&quot;

It turned out that his Dad had bought the Bus in question
new, for his plumber's shop, in '74, that it had
accumulated less than 70k kilometres since, and that it
had been garaged most of the time.  No, it's not flawless,
there's been a lot of welding going on, most of it rather,
hmm, shall we call it &quot;solid&quot;.  Not pretty, but solid.
Bit scruffy in the cargo bay.  Nice cab and dash though.
No rust holes.  No collision damage.  Nice original paint 
where the welding isn't, and at least same colour paint 
where the welding is.  Colour is Orange.  Full length
roof rack.  Flawlessly clean engine ith good engine seal.  
Even a year left until its next inspection.  New tyres.

Sigh.  I need another Bus like I need a third leg.

To hell with it.  If this thing drives the way it looks,
I'll even pay the US$400 asking price.  I'm trying to get 
it down to $300 though, on the grounds that the welding
isn't really presentable.

And then I'll have four of my own, and will still be a
50% co-owner of two more.  Grr.  Anyone need a '72
Highroof Walkthrough Panel Van project in North Germany?
Thought so.  How about a '78 Westfalia Helsinki project?  
A '61 Panel Van project?  (Those are the co-owned ones.
The Westy might even be sellable, the other guy has
cooled on the idea too.)  Any takers?  Huh?  Huh?  Maybe 
a Bug or three?  A Bug convertible?  A '77 Audi 80?  
Anyone?  Huh?

And do I really want to sell any of this?

&quot;Depends.&quot;

Airhowlingly yours,
   Erik.

couple of water-boilers; failing to shrink the collection 
to manageable proportions in the foreseeable future.  Hey,
but I'm down to only three Panel Vans, that's something!
