Subject: re: Place for out-of-print owners manuals

I just ordered a NOS Owners Manual for my '64 Standard/Microbus from Sun
Bugs, don't have the address/phone number here, but it is someplace in
deepest California, they had a flyer in a recent NEATO newsletter.
$38, included shipping.

For any non-air-cooled VW, I'd check out the BMW pages, or look in
Hemmings Motor News, where you can get most anything, though you will
pay $$$.
