&gt; &gt; the big question is what would have been changed/damaged by the backfire.
&gt; &gt; before backfire (which I caused not engine problem) it ran ok.

&gt; Honestly, I don't know what it would do other than pop off hoses, but
&gt; then again I've never had a backfire.  I do know what you're feelin,
&gt; though, because you just want to know how the backfire could have caused
&gt; the problem.  Unfortunately, you can't guarantee that it is in-fact the
&gt; backfire that is causing the problem...

lunch break, and here is where it stands.

if the AFM is unplugged it starts and runs... idles the way it should.

. so suspect the AFM....

stick my spare AFM in and find I've been carrying a &quot;dud&quot; along for years.
glad I didn't need it on the side of the road.
  so pop the cover on the AFM and start the bus, if I hold the flap ever
so slightly open, the engine idles and advances. so &quot;suspect&quot; the backfire
may have moved the flapper on the shaft????  is there any way to check or
adjust this??   I've no experience messing with the AFM guts.. and if I
don't have another one in the garage somewhere I'm messing with the only
known good one??

anyone have more info on how to adjust flapper.  nothing in Bentley...
