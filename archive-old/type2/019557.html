Subject: Still lookin 4 a mechanic in NY

This is my second plea to the list for a  mechanic in the NY
metropolitan area, long island. Heck I'd pretty much travel anywhere
(within reason) for an honest bus mechanic. I have just acquired a 1976
bus which I want a real mechanic to look over completely. I am looking
to do a total restore but need competent advice from a mechanic who
knows busses an will tell me what I'm up against. The body is in decent
shape and she runs well but it looks to me as if I need tons of fuel
injection stuff, (hoses,valves etc.) there are all kinds of things
unplugged in the engine compartment. So I thank you all again in
advance.
