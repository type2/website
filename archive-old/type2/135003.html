Courtney,

My '74 Campmobile has been doing this lately when I'm heading up a big hill, 
I've been putting it down to water in the petrol from a couple of service 
stations, have you gotten fuel from anywhere new lately?

&gt; My 1200cc standard VW has just decided the other day to sit and idle fine, 
&gt; but will hesitate, pop through the carb on occasion, and stumble if you 
&gt; give it any gas under load. It does better while sitting still, but under 
&gt; load will display all the above symptoms. I can barely get it up a hill in 
&gt; 3rd, have to go back to 2nd to get the revs up and stumble, jerk, cut out 
&gt; up the hill slowly. I've replaced the coil, the points, the distributor 
&gt; and everything electrical to no avail. (I have spare parts that are known 
&gt; good).

&gt; I checked the plugs a month ago and they were fine looking. There are no 
&gt; apparent electrical shorts anywhere.appears fine.
