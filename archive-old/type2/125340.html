Subject: RE: [T2] Wheel Cylinders

&gt; Autozone has generic ones for $25. Napa ranges from $21 to 
&gt; $35 and also carries a $9 rebuild kit. Busdepot has $15 ones 
&gt; and $7 ones (&quot;Indian made&quot;). Has anybody used the $7 ones 
&gt; from BD? Any advice with the rebuild kits?


Actually there is a third alternative. We also sell Italian made ones
for $9.95. (Link below.)  I have found these to be comparable to the $15
German ones, although some people prefer to spend the extra $5 for
German just as a matter of course.  I think I'd recommend them over the
Indian ones, given the small price difference. We have had a higher
return rate on the Indian ones, although still well within an acceptable
level (well below 1 percent). Personally I have used all three on my
vans at various times and never had any of them fail until years later.
