Subject: Administrivia - list getting seriously constipated

Ladies, Gentlemen, (and the rest of you, too)

Right at the moment, the list backlog is approaching 200 messages, and 
growing.  The oldest message in the queue is now from 11/02! *Please* stop 
it on the counting! *Please* keep it on topic!  Traffic is way up all of a 
sudden, and if we overload things, then no one gets anything!
