Subject: Re: [T2] Dwell Creep

Still haven't solved the dwell creep. Had some time to do some
examination of the distributor. This distributor is a relatively new
Bruck SVDA (aprox 2000 miles)

The distributor shat does not appear worn. I also tried to move the
shaft up or down and it has no play in those directions.

&gt; When dwell changes with RPM it is usually a result of either a worn
&gt; distributor or a missing spring between the distributor shaft and
&gt; distributor drive gear.

&gt; If the bearings in the dist are worn you can get all sorts of funny
&gt; &quot;standing waves&quot; in the vibration pattern that change the dwell angle.

Bearings seem OK.

&gt; There should be NO side to side movement in the distributor shaft relative
&gt; to the distributor case.  If there is, replace the distributor.

There is a very slight side to side movement.

&gt;  VW put that spring between the drive gear and the
&gt; distributor shaft to pretension the shaft at the top of its travel and
&gt; keep the cam in the same position relative to the points.  If it is
&gt; missing then dwell will wander all over the place.  Replace that spring!

Hmm. I'm having trouble picturing or locating this spring. Is it on
the inside of the distributor body?

I did notice some play in the movement of the plate which holds the
points. There is some unexplained movement around the horizontal
plane. For example, if I grab the points assembly and move it back and
forth while mounted to the points plate, I can make the plate wobble
about millimeter up and down. Doesn't seem desirable. I don't have a
good vacuum distributor around so I can't verify if this is actually a
problem.

When I have the money the solution is obvious - Bosch SVDA distributor
with pertronix. 009 until then? - I'd rather not.
