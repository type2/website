Subject: 009 v. 050

Could anyone point to a source for determining the differences between the
Bosch 009 and 050 distributors? Originally thought the 72 Micro had a 009
(don't laugh, just bought the damn thing), but it appears to be a 050. It
certainly isn't stock, that's for sure. I seem to recall seeing a
discussion of the various distributors for VWs, but my aimless wanderings
on the web and elsewhere today failed to come up with anything, and my
various manuals are mute on the subject.
