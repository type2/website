Subject: late bay owners 76-79

fellow listmembers......

I have been working on finding all of the &quot;this isn't connected to anything&quot;
type stuff
and putting it all back together regardless of how important it seems, and
still working
on these tubes that come out of the fuel system someplace, I believe to help
it breathe.

The top right hand side of my charcoal canister, there is a thin little tube
that goes noplace
currently, and I think that is part of this same system.

Here is a pic of what I do have now, I think I am definetly missing some of
those items.
Could you take a look at this and see what I'll need to get this put back
together correctly?

Just not sure what I need to order, or if I can get what I need at a
hardware store/flaps to fix this?

thanks for any tips, info, tomfoolery you can shed on the subject...

Christopher
