Subject: fuel smell round 2

ok pulled the carb apart- remember was getting fuel smell out exhaust-i
think primarily at idle- someone standing behind my car at idle tells me
it smells like gas. i cant smell (result of brain surgery-another story)
i havent had anyone run behind my car at 55 mph! im assuming im lean
since i pulled plugs- all are very light tan/white swirled pattern -its
pretty but lean right? anyway back to idle-float is working fine ,jets
all in place and tight (Dr. Tim! )so on to idle adjustments 1600 dp-009
and new 34 pict 3. idle speed screw was 5 turns out and mixture screw
about 1 1/2 turns out. could that be my problem at idle? too rich? i
have changed oil and plugs (Dr. Tim) i need a new gasket so its not
ready to go together yet. but on monday ill get to it unless i can find
a gasket today. should i just run through the regular set idle routine
with tach and see what i come up with?
thanks in advance!
brian and the kreeper
