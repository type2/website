&quot;Lowers rpm&quot; is a very relative term.

Itch has an 091 (.88 4th + 4.57 R&amp;P) which raised the top speed in 1, 2, and
3 considerably (17.6%) over the standard '69 tranny. The .88 4th and 4.57
(as opposed to the original .82 4th &amp; 5.375 R&amp;P) give me slightly (~400)
lower rpm _at_ 60mph (3200+ vs. 3600+), but make the jump into 4th from 3rd
much easier to handle (not as much of a rpm drop).

I'm running a 1915, so Itch can handle the taller gearing quite nicely. I'm
not so sure about a stock 1600, though.

Also, the guy that built my tranny asked me if I wanted a .82 4th instead of
the .88. My first inclination was to go .82. I'm glad I didn't, because I
live in the hills, and I'm sure I would bog down on at least 3-4 hills I
must scale to/from work. With the .88, I make them without having to
downshift.

Terrain, GVW, Tire size, and motor power all should be considered before
making the jump.
