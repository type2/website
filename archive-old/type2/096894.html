Bob makes a good point! Also check the breather hose coming from the 
engine and make sure it is hooked up to something like the air 
cleaner or the carb. If some is coming from the vents the it is 
coming off the top of the motor somewhere so have a good look around 
for leaks such as around the oil pressure sender.

&gt;probably burning off the assembly materials and the greasy fingerprints on
&gt;the exhaust etc, but keep an eye on it.  however coming from the vents on
&gt;the back pillers is a concern, was the engine on???
