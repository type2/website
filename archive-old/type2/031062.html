sounds like it is part of an Eberspracher(sp) gas fired aux heater that
were installed on some vans.  if it were complete and working it is a REAL
furnace.  if you can I would try to find the parts to get it working. in
the meantime I would put something over the hole, ducktape or something
removable. and carefully take that spark/glow plug and save it, VW wants
$130 for one.  

clamp off the fuel line, make sure the wiring is disconnected and ignore
it until you can find the heater parts.
