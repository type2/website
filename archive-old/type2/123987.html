Subject: Re:Strange thoughts when bored at work...

&quot;Assuming it could be perfectly sealed, how well would keeping the
cylinders and heads in a waterflow work?&quot;

Why not just add a water spray into the cooling fan and shroud?  Then
the water would help cool the engine by evaporation.  Just make sure
to use a mechanical pump to spray in the water because an electric one
would be noisy, not to mention dangerous!!!!    :-)

    Have a good weekend everybody!
