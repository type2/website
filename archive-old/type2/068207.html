Hi,
I am in search of an earlier camper and looking to spend up to $2,500 for a
van in reasonably good shape.  I live in Lebanon county. The year is not too
criticle, although my first car was a 69 camper so I am slightly partial to
them.  If you know of anyone looking to sell, or if you have any advice to
aid in my search it would be greatly appreciated.

I am in central Pennsylvania and would appreciate any help.

thank you,
Owen Zimmerman
