Subject: lambskin seat covers
X-Diagnostic: MESSAGE REQUIRES APPROVAL

Whoever out there has a &quot;G.I. Joe's&quot; outdoor an Auto
outlet close to you (West coast only?). They have
sheepskin seat covers that fit a bus seat like they
were made for it _at_ $21.00 each...on sale. the side
of the covers are faux sheepskin but the seat area is
real. They come in the original tan or gray or black.
Was nice to have this cold morning!

My dog is usually pleased with what I do, 
because he is not infected with the concept of what I &quot;should&quot; be doing.
