Subject: Re: Flywheel System Logic

Can anybody substantiate this 100,000 rpm business? Isn't that what
somebody said? I don't know squat about this, but just having played with
they gyroscope I got for the kids it seems to me like a heavy flywheel
spinning that fast could flop a passenger car over on its side as a matter
of course if you tried to contradict it...
