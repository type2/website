&gt; Okay Tony, I'll bite... WTH is Burt Monro ?
&gt; 
&gt; 
   The World's Fastest Indian...Or at least
as played by Anthony Hopkins in the movie
of the same name...Burt ran a 1920 Indian at
Bonneville during the sixties (when he was also in
his sixties) at 178 mph...He made his own racing
tyres by sawing the tread off of regular tyres and
using black shoepolish to disguise the cracks in the
tyres. He also designed and built his own engine...Did
I mention that he was also from New Zealand? Talk about
overcoming adversity... ;-)
