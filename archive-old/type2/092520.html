Subject: Re: Fw: [T2] Broken Easy Out

They can weld a tool steel rod to it. Sometimes that works. I should have 
said, consult a MACHINIST. This the the type that will have the advance 
equipment and skills necessary to remove the broken cobalt, then the broken 
stud, then rethread with a timed insert.

Left hand twist cobalt drills will work for the stud, but don't normally 
work with hand held drills. Must be jugged up in a press if trying to 
remove a hardened stud. If the easy out is cobalt, you will need a diamond 
drill. A machinist won't do, you need a MACHINIST Cum Laude.

&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;Just curious about what tricks a machinist
&gt; &gt; &gt;might use in this sitution that couldn.t be
&gt; &gt; &gt;applied by a human bean.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Electron discharge machining. Take it out one atom at a time. Bring your
&gt; &gt; checkbook.
&gt;
&gt;The last time i made a visit to my local
&gt;automotive machinist I didn't notice any
&gt;electron discharge machining equipment.
&gt;
&gt;Are there any other methods that are commonly
&gt;used to professionally remove broken studs ?
