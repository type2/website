Joe,

I was at Josh's Camper page and noticed a picture he had for a sundial
interior was missing.  It was linked from my page/isp directory.  I had
removed the JPG due to the 1mb limitations imposed by my ISP months ago not
realizing it would affect other web pages.  I have put it back up, not on my
pages but in the ISP's directory.  Went to the page and tested it OK.  If
you missed it let me know and I will send it to you.

Josh will be missed......

Peace,

Mike &amp; Christine Mott
