Subject: Re: [T2] Moisture in my oil?

water is a natural product of combustion.  A bit of that will get past
your rings and if the engine doesn't get hot enough to evaporate it it
will show up in the oil as &quot;milk&quot;.

&gt; How can I have moisture in my oil at -30 to -

&gt;
&gt; It is brown and milky, looks like I have to
&gt; change it.
&gt;
&gt; I have been using gasoline additives and
&gt; alchool to get rid of water in my gas, does it
&gt; end up in your oil?
