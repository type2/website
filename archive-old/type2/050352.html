Subject: [T2] solar

I have had a solar panel on the pop top of my pre '72 campers for many
years.  It's great to use the slant of the top to get the most direct
exposure to the sun.  I have seperate batteries for this.  They sit under
cover just behind the raised pop top.  Which, by the way, does stay
raised about a foot when i drive in warm weather.  I typically run stuff
like fans and a TV and radio.  My task now is to set up a seperate fuse
box for my solar.  Are there any thoughts on this?
