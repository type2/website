&gt; Ok , any ideas

Sorry to say there are many reasons for a Volkswagen to run hot. Other
than the ones that you listed try:

Your fuel/air mix may be off.  if it is not getting enough gas and is
running lean, it will run hot.  Take it to a mechanic to have this
checked.

You say you cleaned the bottom of the oil cooler.  If something got sucked
in though the fan and blown into the oil cooler, it will be laying on top
of the cooler and blocking air flow.  The only way to be positive on this
is to remove the fan and shroud to look but spraying engine cleaner, then
a high pressure hose up from beneath may work.

As you drive, do you find that the throttle is fully engaged most of the
time? Do you drive with the gas pedal all the way down? If so, then you
may have a weak coil or low compression or you may simply be driving too
fast.  In any case, a fully open throttle for long periods will cause your
engine to run hot.

What is the air temperature where you live? If the air is 35 degrees (95
fahrenheit) then the bus is simply going to run hotter.

                             OOK!
