&gt; Ok. so let me get this right. The studs that hold the rocker arms down,
can
&gt; be removed? and this one stud, when they rebuilt the head and shot the
&gt; helicoil into the hole, was just done badly or whatever. So then all i
&gt; should have to do is take out the stud and put some locktite on it and put
&gt; it back in. Then i can sleep soundly!!?? WOW. I hope that thats all it is.
&gt; Ill let you know
&gt;

Yes, I understand that rocker-arm-assembly studs often  will do this (strip
out) especially if rebuilt with helicoil inserts...sometimes they will pull
out &quot;de novo&quot; and you will have to helicoil or threadsert the stud socket
yourself. (or have a mechanic to do it with the proper tools ) .... and the
cool thing is it can be done WITHOUT pulling the head or dropping the
engine. Because of the shape of the stud (bigger at the base than at the
tip) the stud will not be able to be pulled out of the hole in the rocker
arm.... you will just turn the nut and it will spin the stud but won't be
connected to anything at the back end...it FEELS like the nut is loose and
you can't tighten it...but you are really just spinning both nut and stud.
If a bad helicoil is in place you can sometimes manage to spin the stud back
in and it will just pull out again after a few minutes of running the engine
because the Helicoil is stripped out and needs to be replaced. Anyway, good
luck ...and don't get frostbite working on your bus :-)

PS: Golden Tip O' the Week
go to a medical equipment supply sshop and buy a box of 100 disposable latex
rubber gloves and start wearing them whenever you are wrenching on the
bus.... protects from busted knuckels and scrapes and keeps your hands clean
so you don't have to be digging grease out from under your fingernails for a
week after each wrenching session.
