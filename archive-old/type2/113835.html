Subject: Re: [T2] Clutch cable

&gt;Did the orignal question get answered? There are two cables:
&gt;
&gt;72-79 (3215mm) 211-721-335J
&gt;68-71 (3200mm) 211-721-335E
&gt;

Yes it did.  I had to drive 60 miles one way  to get the correct one. I had 
to go to Peek Performance in Maryland. It went in easy and works like a 
dream.  I need to replace the cable sleeve but that can wait a few 
days.  I'm mobile again. Thank goodness I had AAA Plus to tow and take me home.
Lessons learned: Always keep AAA Plus up to date and make sure you have the 
correct cable as a spare!
