Subject: valve stem seals

I'm just about to install  valve stem seals on a 1776. and I am not sure
where on the stem to place them.

I'm trying to guess how oil gets between the stem and the inside of the
valve guides.  My hunch is that it enters the inside of the valve covers
through the channel in the push rods. lubricates the rockers,  and flows
back to the sump through the push rod tubes. Does it just splash around
underneath the valve covers and somehow work its way into the guides?

If this is so, then the seal can't go on the spring side of the guide but
should be on the other side of the guide. If this is so, can it just be
sitting anywhere along the length of the stem in that cavity?

Thanks Jack
