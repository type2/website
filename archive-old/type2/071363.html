&gt;      Anybody have any good ideas for removing crusty old
&gt;  paint off of rubber window mouldings and those little
&gt;  plastic gizmo's around the door handles  ?
&gt;      Bought a new, '79 van, that has a fair paint job but a
&gt;  lousy masking job !

Peter, I haven't found any paint strippers that say they are ok to use on 
plastic or rubber.  More importantly, I think there is too much risk of 
accidently getting this stuff on the paint, especially when wiping the 
stripper off.  I use lacquer thinner to remove overspray if it hasn't been 
too long after painting.  Even if it's been awhile, try it anyway as it may 
remove some of the overspray.  Don't get any on the paint if you can avoid 
it.  After the lacquer thinner has softened the overspray, use a new single 
edge razor blade to scrape it off.  If it's been a long time since painted, 
the paint should come off another way--it should chip off the flexible rubber 
when scraped.  A round toothpick with the tip broken off works well to remove 
the paint off the door handle seals, but a small screw driver tip or the 
non-sharp corner of the razor blade may be necessary--be careful!!  If all 
else fails, especially on old porous rubber where the paint was absorbed into 
the pores and can't be all scrapped off, you can use black tire paint to 
&quot;touch up&quot; the rubber--an old detailers' trick.
