Subject: Best way to fix hydralic. lifters
To: type2_at_type2_dot_com

My friend bought a 78 bus with a hydralic 2 liter motor....

a couple of them are making noise....

the bus has not been run for a couple of years, I think the hydralics just 
need to be pumped up....

whats the best way to do this with the least damage ?

thanks for your help......
