Well, the fun and games are over.  For now anyways.  Being that this was
my first EveryBus, I promised myself that I would take pictures to
remember the event.  I was not disappointed.  My engine, as a lot of
people already knew, was running pretty bad.  Friday morning I managed
to limp to Linville, NC on three cylinders to meet up with Doc Ric and
everyone from the Roan Mt. carabus. Ric and others took a look and we
ended up fixing the problem by just swapping the injectors on cylinders
1 and 2.  What gives??  So we head to Greensboro and the bus runs fine,
although Ric's had a heating problem that would continue through the
trip home.  I got to EB with the intention of still dropping my engine
to replace the rear main seal and some other stuff.  However, after some
thinking through, I decided that I would hold off because I do not have
enough money to buy more parts if we ran into other problems.  I do
thanks all those that volunteered to help me.  Now, with Steve Dolan's
expert advice that I still had a vacuum leak  (eeerrrrrrrrrrr!!!!), I
set out shortly to replace my injector seals with ones that were given
to me by Mike (to the man that gave them to me, correct me if I got your
name wrong).  Will also be replacing the fuel lines in that area with
some that Mr. Dolan gave me.  I am sort of annoyed at myself because out
of all the tools floating around there, including the ones that Jason
had right next to me, I never did get my compression checked.  LOL  I
will stop running off now and just let you know that all the pics I took
can be viewed at www.wicals_dot_com &lt;http://www.wicals_dot_com/&gt;  .   One last
thanks to Doc Ric, Steve Dolan, Jason LASTER, Mad Uncle Dave, all those
from the Roan Mt. carabus, Mike-for the injector seals, Mike Benthin,
and everyone else that helped me out while I was there.  For our first
trip, my family was very impressed and happy to meet all those that we
have been talking to on the list.  We look forward to all the other
events and will do what we can to make those as well.  Thanks everyone,
and happy busing.
