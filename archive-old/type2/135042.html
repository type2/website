Subject: Re: [T2] 'Remanufactured by Bosch' Alternator

I did over 200 miles, Yuma to Tucson, on a failing alternator. Had to 
stop half way to get battery charged. Swapped alternators the next day 
(I carried a spare).

The big problem occurred when it got dark. You can't use lights and FI 
at the same time with a dead alternator and a mostly discharged 
battery. I did without the lights for a mile or two.

This experience is now on my &quot;never again&quot; list.
