Subject: sudden loss of brake fluid: Welcome to Brake Repair 

Greetings from the coast, Bill !
  Wow, seems like it's been a lousy couple of weeks for the Portland area 
busses: First Brandy gets rearended and now your brake 
adventure...Good thing you noticed it in time! On 
the brighter side: The amount of expertise the 2 of you will gain by working on 
your busses will make you better people and even more useful to this 
list (HEHE...)But seriously: I replaced my rear wheel brake cylinders 
last year. Nothing catastrophic, I just noticed I had a very slow 
leak on both. Replaced them both. About 4$ each, from J.C.Whitneys. 
The replacement cylinders when they arrived turned out to be from Italy --- I started 
to sweat profusely, but they proved okay: 30000 miles and no 
problem...This is also a good time to replace your brake fluid. I 
actually pumped about 1 quart of new brake fluid through the system 
before all the old goo was out. Looked like it hadn't been changed in 
ten years...
  About your specific questions:
1. Diagnosis sounds right. Pull off the wheel and undo the 2 bolts 
that hold the brakedrum on. Remove the brakedrum, using gentle 
persuasion (rubber mallet). If it sticks you'll have to back up the 
brake adjusters a few clicks, then wack the drum a bit with the 
hammer again. Once it's off, you'll see what's wrong. The brake 
cylinder is on top of the brake assembly (assuming your 70 drum brakes are 
like my 73's). 
2. Considering how cheap new cylinders are (see above), I would not bother with 
rebuilding.
3. Once you have the brakedrum off you'll see if you need new shoes. 
You do if they've got brake fluid on them.
Check for wear at that time as well. If you choose to replace, 
replace on both rear wheels, and get a brake hardware kit, with all 
those little thingies, as well. 
4. I would check the condition of the right wheel brake cylinder and 
shoes as well. Take it from there. 
5. Not much else. Whatever you do, do it in the right sequence (so 
your new shoes don't get ruined by spilled brake fluid...):
        1. Replace brake cylinders
        2. Replace brake fluid and bleed system. Clean up.
        3. Put on new shoes. Grease the little adjuster wheels with 
            anti-seize. 
        4. Adjust brakes + handbrake

Well, looks like you got a busy weekend ahead. Are we still on for 
that brew on the 15th or 16th of Dec???
  Have fun,
                        Gregor


&gt; Greetings: 
&gt; 
&gt; On my way to a friend's house for Thanksgiving dinner tonight in my bus
&gt; [the &quot;Alice's Restaurant&quot; overtones were heavy], the brakes went spongy
&gt; for two or three pumps, then pretty much disappeared.  Pulled into a
&gt; parking lot and checked: The brake fluid had gone out through the left
&gt; rear wheel.  [&quot;Yessir, Officer Obie, sir, I cannot tell a lie:  I *parked*
&gt; my bus over that puddle of brake fluid.&quot;]
&gt; 
&gt; Thanksgiving day traffic at 4pm is very light, so with a friend to follow
&gt; me I crept home [you've heard me complain about living at the top of a
&gt; hill; not today].  We went back to our friend's place and had a
&gt; Thanksgiving dinner that couldn't be beat.  I got home a couple hours ago
&gt; and have been reading up on brake repair for a 1970 bus [drum brakes] ever
&gt; since. 
&gt; 
&gt; After triangulating among Haynes, Chilton, Clymer, and Bentley, with some
&gt; Hoover thrown in for Kentucky windage, I'm figuring brake cylinder here. 
&gt; [Sure, obvious to you pros (if that's really it), but something of a
&gt; Rosetta Stone moment for a rookie.]
&gt; 
&gt; Well, I was only gonna do some writing on Friday anyway, right?  So:
&gt; 
&gt; 1. Does the diagnosis sound right?  With the wheel on I can only see that
&gt; fluid's coming out from inside the brake drum.  When I get the wheel off,
&gt; what specifically should I be looking for?  Even if I've sussed out the
&gt; right place to start looking, I'm still not experienced enough yet to
&gt; understand what kind of failure would have caused this kind of
&gt; spectacularly abrupt problem--something broke?  fell off?  came unscrewed?
&gt; got plugged up? something else? 
&gt; 
&gt; 2. Assuming it's the brake cylinder:  Rebuild or replace?  If badly pitted, 
&gt; then replace; but are there any other considerations?  Time versus money? 
&gt; Completely right versus nearly right?
&gt; 
&gt; 3. Am I out for a set of shoes now, too?  Is this likely to have ruined
&gt; them from contact with brake fluid? 
&gt; 
&gt; 4. At what point will any of this work on the left rear brakes require 
&gt; work on the right rear brakes too?  
&gt; 
&gt; 5. While I have the thing apart, what else should I be looking for?
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks in advance for any advice.

&gt; 
&gt; p.s.  Ken, even though it's Friday on the West Coast, I sweartogod I'm not
&gt; trying to resurrect that &quot;bumper sticker&quot; thread, but:  Our county traffic
&gt; engineers office is giving out bumper stickers that say I BRAKE FOR RED
&gt; LIGHTS, though they seem a little reluctant to send them to people outside
&gt; the county.  I'm investigating further; if anyone's interested, send me a
&gt; private e-mail and I'll let you know what I find out.
