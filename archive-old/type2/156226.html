Subject: Re: [T2] Ozark Trail 11'x8' 'Dining Canopy on clearance at
  Wally World

I just had to make a run to Wally World to get a rod &amp; reel I've  had my eye on  (Shakespeare Intrepid - nice light combo).  I  bruised by where that canopy was and they didn't have any.  Nor a  tag on the shelf.  So it must be discontinued.     Cheers...KR

today to check out the Ozark Trail 11'x8' 'Dining Canopy that Kevin Roberts
talked about a few weeks ago.  It has been marked down to $17!  Of course, I
picked one up.  Get them while they last.
