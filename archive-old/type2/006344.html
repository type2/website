&gt;How tight should I tourqe the nuts on the exhaust ports on my 2 litre, I
&gt;think they are loose because I put a big boulbus exhaust on and it rattled
&gt;and such

Eric- rather than give you that torque spec, let me suggest
that you look at the additional supports for the original equipment
heat exchangers, and make sure you have something there.
If you are supporting the whole thing on the exhaust ports alone
you will be back asking how to replace broken head studs very soon.
