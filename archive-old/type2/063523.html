Subject: cleaning FG westy

Well actually I've never had a westy, but I have had a fibreglass boat.. I'd use
clorox  liberally and get it sparkling in no time.   I have a mahogony homemade
camper top on my '69 and I've bleached it from time to time at refinishing time.
I don't think clorox will hurt the paint...Never hurt mine, but my paint is
polyeurethane.
