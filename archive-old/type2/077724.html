Subject: RE: Marval Mystery Oil

When I lived in Chicago --all my cars were outside--So I tested Marvel
Mystery Oil regarding &quot;upper lubrication&quot;--I will tell you this -- Before
MMO was put into my VW and I started it up in Cold weather the motor was
noisy until it warmed up--After MMO was put in the Motor and upon starting
the motor was A LOT less noisy, instantly!!--and I mean a LOT!! I notice the
same effect here in Phoenix--That is whenever it gets cold--MMO is the ONLY
supplement I will use or recommend--TWWM, uj
