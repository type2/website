Subject: starter relay/ugly breakdown: update

Greetings, all:

I put a new fuse in the starter relay, and the bus started just fine.  I
feel like I'm driving a ticking bomb, though, since I don't know what
caused it to go belly-up last night and realize it might do it again at
any time. 

Until I get any further bright ideas [or someone loans me one of theirs],
I'm just going to limit myself to driving only to those places I'm willing
to walk back from.  If/when it goes south on me again, I'll share my pain
with you. 

Thanks to all for their advice and encouragement.

Bill
