Subject: ain't love grand?

Well today is the day.  Stella and I celebrated our 1 year anniversary
together today.  Too bad it was rainy and all around crappy out
today...otherwise I would have given her some fresh oil...oh well...
I'll take her out camping this weekend :)

Just think...a year ago I was some stupid kid who didn't know a thing
about buses....i may still be some &quot;stupid kid&quot; ;-) but I know a thing
or two about buses now...

A year with a bus will teach you a LOT...so to all of you
newbies...stick in there!  As they say ...its a steep learning curve.  I
know I still have a LOT to learn!

now...what else should I get stella for our anniversary?
