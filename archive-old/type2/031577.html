understatement of the year, I think the torque converter alone must weigh
as much as a manual tranny. (ok slight exageration but not much)

&gt; If you remove just the engine...it might

yes I always check before the engine comes clear of the lower studs, it
can easily be pushed back into the tranny with a needle nosed plier or
even a pencil eraser, on end of long pencil

&gt; if you don't remove the engine straight back...the result is a bent shaft and 
&gt; that's the end of your tranny.  Any way that you seperate the engine from the 

well not really, the shaft is replaceable and there are a few floating
around. I always grab em when I see a dead tranny lying around so I have
one or two in the garage, came in handy when someone towed the van without
the engine and it fell out &quot;somewhere&quot; on the road

&gt; final drive/tranny remember  to replace the Torque Converter Seal and 
&gt; Bushing.

hint, the torque converter seal (which is on the tranny not the torque
converter) does not go all the way in to the seat, but must remain flush
with the front edge of the tranny housing.  otherwise it leaks like a
gyser.... ask me how I know!


good luck
