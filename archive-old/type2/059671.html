Howdy Volks,

I just purchased a rebuilt Bosch generator, stamped 38 AMP and am replacing
a dirt filled 30 AMP.  Considered an Alternator, but wanted to keep things
open to revert to 6v generator at a later time...

Anyway -- the pulley confuses me.  As I'm sure we all know, this is a
two-piece pulley that you put shims between the two halves to adjust for
belt tension.

What confuses me is that two generators I have -- the inside half of the
pulley does NOT spin freely on the shaft ... yet the new ones does.  I also
notice a &quot;key cut&quot; in the shaft, but nothing seems to mate with it... Not on
the one I took off, nor on the one that I put on.

How are you supposed to tighten the fan on with the 46mm bolt?  It just
spins freely the shaft freely... I ultimately had to put the both halfs of
the pulley on and put the 21mm nut on ... then I could tighten the 21mm nut
against the 46mm bolt.  But is this supposed to be how it works?

That wasn't how it worked when I took the other (30am generator) off.  I had
already taken the front half of the pulley off, yet the half closest to the
generator was what I used for leverage to break the 46mm bolt.  In other
words, it didn't freely spin on the shaft (yet popped off, and I really
don't see WHY it held the shaft).
