Subject: re Vanagon 2L Motor Weight

Hey Everyone,
Well still trying to figure out what to do the westy has been driven to my uncle's house with a fully heated garage and nice work space. Just wondered what people thought of this drop the motor there in CT about 250 miles from my home take home in the back of my subaru wagon the turnkey motor bring it to the guy here and get the top end of the motor rebuilt assemble at home and the drive it back down with the turn key ready to go.  But anybody know the weight of the motor can I put that in the back of my wagon without killing my wagon a 92 Legacy too. 
Thanks
Kevin
