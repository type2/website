Subject: Re: replacing nuts

&gt;I gave up trying to find copper nuts in metric size - I lost one out of my
&gt;set of four - I had to use a stainless one as a replacement -I'd like to
&gt;know where you get the copper ones from!

I got mine from Harloff Auto Parts in La Mesa, Calif..  I know, not much
help to those in other parts of the country.  I would try a fastener
company - in the San Diego area, one such place is Ababba Bolt in El Cajon.
You may have to buy in quantity but they will have just about any bolt or
nut you need.
