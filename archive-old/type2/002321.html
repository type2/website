Well my single cab is back on the road with a new used 1776 and new dual
Kadrons. Man does she run nice!! Great power and top end too. The 1776 makes
a huge difference from a tired 1600 sp (duh)!!! I put the brake booster to
the carb balance tube and the brakes work great (without the booster they
were terrible)! Overall I'm pleased with the results.

Now to my question. I'm trying to make the VDO oil temp gauge previously
installed in the accessory instrument window of my dash work. I got a VDO
dip
stick sender. When I connected it to the wire from the guage and then
grounded
the sender, the indicator pegs to off the scale, i.e. greater than 300. And
yes, that
is with the motor not running, cold. Does this mean that my sender and guage
are incompatible or I just have it hooked up wrong?

Any thoughts or ideas appreciated!
