&gt; I don't suppose I can just purchase new hubs can I?
&gt; 
&gt; Hoping I'm not going to have to spend too much more money...

I came upon a similar dilema about 2 weeks ago. I *wanted*
so badly to re-use the old ones. However, I also hate doing
things twice. OTOH, I am POOR. My solution was to find a used
one ( I only needed one). I paid $20 and it was already removed,
came with a good boot to boot!!
So that is my $.02


&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; VW busses, Mountain Bikes and Macintosh.  What else is there?
&gt; 
&gt; 

LOTS!!!!!!  :)
