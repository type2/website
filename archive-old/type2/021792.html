If I read the original post right it sounds like she had the tire rebalanced
after the wheel weights fell off.
Missy also said something about the weights are now on the inside of the rim.
Were the weights on the
outside before? If this is true I can't see the tire changing &quot;balance&quot;that much
the weights are now needed
on the inside! It sounds like that tire could be bad.
Just a guess.
