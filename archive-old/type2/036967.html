My take on this is that the oil bath filter harkens back to the era when
owner maintainance was the norm and the local FLAPS was miles away.  One
less part to replace, and a handy use for that half-liter of oil left over
after the oil change.

These days, people want to stay clean, so replacable elements are the
norm.
