Subject: Re: [T2] Help w/ vacuum lines on 74 dual carb

&gt; Ohhhh, now my head hurts.  I was feeling very comfortable with the top

&gt; And the other vacuum port attaching to the lower one (on the left of
&gt; the carb).
&gt;
&gt; My concern all along is that there is this other port, which appears
&gt; to be vacuum and is currently capped off, below the air cleaner
&gt; assembly on the thing that connects the two carbs.  Now I'm not sure
&gt; that even the advance vacuum line is correct.

Ray,

You left out the first part of the first sentence of my mail to you ...

&gt; &gt; I don't own a dual carb bus, never have, but the theory of the vac
&gt; &gt; advance/retard distributor is...

Alas, the position of the various ports on various carbs is a very
carb-specific matter :-(  Since I have not owned a bus like yours, I can't
say for sure which port does what on your carbs.

&gt; Steve, I guesss first I need to know whether port or manifold connects
&gt; to the advance on the dizzy.

Vacuum advance connects to ported vacuum.

&gt;  I really do not want to buy a vacuum guage.  Maybe I will have to.

Ray, I strongly suggest you do!  They have all sorts of uses on a bus.  At
this point in time, my recommendation is that you go out and buy a
mity-vac at your flaps.  They are less than $20 and include not only a
gauge, but a vacuum pump.  The vacuum pump is very useful for bleeding
your brakes, the gauge will let you tune and check your engine.  A very
useful all-'round tool!

&gt; Anyone have a stock dual solex setup that can take a look at there
&gt; carbs and dizzy for me?

The ideal solution!!!  Please, someone with stock dual carbs, go and have
a look!  I would go out to Springfield and take some pics of Barry's '72,
but I promised my boss I would come in to work today, even tho it is a
holiday.
