Subject: Re: [T2] 78 T2 Air Intake Boot

You might try a product called Automotive Goop

(http://www.eclecticproducts_dot_com/goop/ad-automotive.asp)

to repair that boot.  Clean it up real well using detergent, a scrub brush
and cloth, and hot water.  I've used this stuff with success for similar
repairs.

Subject: [T2] 78 T2 Air Intake Boot


&gt; The air intake boot on my 78 T2 has several cracks. I think that this is
&gt; leading to some of my problems. Cant find any new ones for sale. Some of
the
&gt; other ones look close, will they work or should I try to seal up the one I
&gt; have. Any thoughts. Thanks, Pete.
