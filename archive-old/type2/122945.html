Subject: RE: [T2] Engine &amp; Heater

&gt;Regarding the lack of heat, I discovered that the in-line fuse that goes to
&gt;the BN4 fan is missing. I (temporarily) bypassed the fuse (since I don't 
&gt;know
&gt;what goes in there yet) and got the fan to work. Also heard clicking.

Clicking is what they do. Mine has a slight click and the other one I have 
seen here
is the same. &lt;click click click&gt; Very slight but still there.


&gt;
&gt;Still no heat, though. I don't think its getting any gas. When I squeeze 
&gt;the
&gt;little hand primer pump in the fuel line, it looks (and sounds) like the 
&gt;fuel
&gt;is squirting back into the tank. I think the PO mounted it in reverse
&gt;orientation.

Also check the different variations in control levers.. might be you have 
engaged
the fan but haven't got the heat turned up.

&gt;Also noticed that the (clear) plastic fuel line going to my heater is 
&gt;really
&gt;hard and stiff. I imagine the fuel line should be regular rubber fuel line
&gt;instead of what looks like fat aquarium tube?

Hard to say, remember it's cold out and stiff is ok. Hard and deteroriating 
is
bad. I think I read somewhere that some people prefer hose that wont bend
and thus kink cutting off the supply of fuel. Odds are it isn't aquarium 
hose
since it would have been eaten away by now Im assuming.


&gt;Thanks everyone who offered suggestions on what to do with my engine. I 
&gt;think
&gt;I'm going to try and find an 1800 to 2000 type 2 engine and rebuild that. 
&gt;The
&gt;brother of my bus's PO wants the beetle engine back (apparently it's more
&gt;powerful that his current engine). Any guesses as to how much it might be
&gt;worth?

Tell him you want an engine for your bus and trade him :) Make him do the
work. Who knows what a motivated person might find.

I'll run into you at some point in person. Could be cool to caravan some 
where :)
