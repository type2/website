I'd be glad to add it to my site. Send it to me and I'll make it available.

Thanks for doing this for the VW community!!

&gt; I'm not particularly for it or against it, but the engine dolly plan is
now
&gt; available direct from me as a .pdf file.  If you haven't got the Acrobat
&gt; reader for that, I know it's freeware from the adobe site
&gt; (http://www.adobe_dot_com I think).  Print it off on your own printer and away
&gt; you go.
&gt;
&gt; Anyone else who wants one but isn't interested in that degree of trouble
can
&gt; send me their postal address and I'll mail you one (freebie, my little
gift
&gt; back for all the help), or get it from the archives.
&gt;
&gt; If the CAD guys want to distribute it from their site, I'll send it there,
&gt; too.  Their call.
