yes it is the &quot;type 4&quot; engine if it is stock, the fuel pump is on the
inside of the frame beam just behind the drivers side rear wheel.  awkward
as all get out to get to, but very straight forward.

&gt; Now I've got two books that go into this process and one says that removing

&gt; tricky enough to make removing the engine the easier option.  The other book

NAH don't take the engine out, but if it is out for another reason that is
the time to work on it.

&gt; makes no mention at all of removing the engine and implies that taking the

&gt; possibility of rebuilding the pump using the rebuild kit, and claims that
&gt; this may be done with the pump still in the vehicle.  I would not be very

only the type 1 engines have a rebuild kit (AFAIK) the type 4 engines are
fuel injected and have a high presure electric pump.  these buggers are
EXPENSIVE so if you can find a good used one so much the better (Rocky
Mountain #0 580 463 016 $ 214.50 (1974 is $312.75!)

&gt; any light on the subject.  Also, what is the best way to clamp fuel lines -
&gt; are there particular clamp specifically designed for the purpose or what.

use a round (not six sided) pencil,  I have small dowels, also I have put
a stopcock valve in my fuel lines so I just turn the valve. (also great
when parking to keep the vehicle from being taken) I used the brass gas
line fittings, with ball valve so there is nothing the gas can damage.
