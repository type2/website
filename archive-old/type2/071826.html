&gt;  Okay, I'm lazy, I'll admit it. The 2L 77 I bought has a stuck motor. Can
&gt;  turn the engine over a quarter turn in each direction before it sticks
&gt;  solid. Now if it were a 1600, I'd suspect a broken flywheel or something
&gt;  lodged in the dist gear, but this was a running type 4 before this happened
&gt;  and the engine appears too clean to have suffered lack of maintenance. As
&gt;  this is my first type 4 I'm looking for the most common things or things
&gt;  peculiar to type 4's, dropped valves,jammed flywheels, etc

possibly something between the piston and head.   You could try pulling the 
plugs and rummaging around, or just pull the heads off

funny thing is the other day I pulled apart a motor with the same symptom- an 
H case 1500.  That somehow I ended up with after and frioend had it 'seize' 
on her.   The reason is this case was severely excessive carbon- the pistons 
could not move all the way towards the head.  guess too rich is a problem, huh
