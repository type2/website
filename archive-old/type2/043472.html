Subject: HCBF and Part needed

Hello List
If your going to HCBF this weekend and happen to have a bottom right
push rod cover plate for a 72 pancake please let me know, I will buy it
from you for the ride back home. Again the piece I'm looking for
attaches to the bottom of the engine on the passengers side and covers
the push rods and the thermostat on that side.

Thank you, and for those who will be there take another look at our bus
so you can stop by and say hello.
