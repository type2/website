I also tried disconnecting the retard hose and timing to 7.5 degrees.  The
reason is that the dual vacuum distributor was designed to retard the
timing at idle way back to something like 5-10 degrees ATDC for emissions
purposes.  By plugging the vac retard and timing at 7.5 BTDC you are in
effect disabling this &quot;feature&quot; of the dual advance distributor.  I don't
see how it would keep the engine from &quot;slowing down faster&quot; and it most
certainly doesn't keep the idle high unless you fail to readjust your idle
after making this mod.  You will definately have to set your idle down a
bit but once that's done it will work just fine.

Not true on the type IV.  With the dual advance distributor hooked up and
set to factory specs, there will be around 40 degrees of total advance -
why should it be different with a mechanical-only distributor?  There is a
lot of information on this in the archives - I don't feel like doing the
math again right now.  But know that if you only have 32 degrees total
advance, you are not running as much advance as VW intended.  That's &quot;one
of&quot; the problems with the 009 in the type IV - to get enough total advance
you would have to set it at around 20 degrees BTDC initial, which is of
course way too much.
