Subject: Help - I've chopped my sliding door up

Actually not that much of a crisis. I'm in the middle of welding inner and
outer repair panels to the sliding door of my 79 bay. I think I've sliced
the door a fraction off square so I can't quite get everything to jig back
up right.

Can somebody please give me the measurements either side, from the bottom of
the panel up to the first crease under the window. Can you also say if it's
a left or right hand panel. I'm presuming both types are the same but the
dimensions reversed, if there's any difference.

Many thanks

Andy Vevers
