Peoples,
  Thanks a lot for the advice about fixing my gas tank sender unit. Now can
anyone out there help me with my taillights!! Problem is there's no juice
to the drivers side brake/tail and backup light, but the blinker works OK.
The passenger side lights and front lights work fine. 
 Now I've just put a new engine in, and before the old one came out there
was no light problem at all. Plus the horn has stopped working too.
Coincidence, maybe, or maybe I've missed some essential connection in
putting the engine back in. Wiring diagrams are only so much help to a
novice like me. Fuses are all fine, wiring is in place and the contacts are
clean so any ideas? 

I'm stumped.
