Wildly Variable!

If you have a good Leibstritz (sp?) muffler and live in Nevada you
might go a couple of decades.  If you have one of those tinfoil
mufflers from Mexico and live in Saltlandia you will replace the thing
every year or two.

Personally, I won't work with any muffler but the Liebstritz.  The
time and hassle of making a Mexican or Brazilian muffler fit the bus
(including such fun tasks as heating and bending the heat risers to
match the intake manifold, and threading the holes that didn't get
threaded by the manufacturer) will far exceed any monetary savings you
might realize.  My experience is that the Leib muffler is much longer
lasting as well.

Anyone know about the stainless steel mufflers I hear rumored now and
then?
