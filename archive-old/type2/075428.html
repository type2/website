Subject: Big Oil leak....not push rods, then what??

Hi There,
I have a '78 2.0 FI camper........I live in Portland, OR

So, a leak started, slowly, about two months ago.  After a couple of long, hard rides around the PacNW, the leak as started to get much worse.

It now leaks a couple of spots the size of small apples when I park it after it has been driven for a little while. I have to add about a 1/2 quart per week, depending on how much I drive it. 

I brought it to a guy so he could take a look at it-- he replced the fan seal b/c it was a little banged up, but now it is worse.  He said the leak doesn't appear to be coming from the Oil cool seals, nor does it look like it is coming from the push rods.

So, after he looked at it, it is still leaking all over the fan casing and underside of the engine, mostly towards the rear of the bus.  There is also oil &quot;mist&quot; all over the back of my bus and all around the the engine cmpartment (it is actually puddling up around the crankshaft).  It is also appearing on the windshield when I turn the defroster on.  And it has an awful smell to it after it sits for 10 minutes after being driven (burnt oil on the engine block?).

Someone said maybe this could be that:

-Oil filter put on more than hand-tight; last oil change was before those hard trips.
-Dipstick weld: Apparently there is a weld that sometimes comes undone?
-Filler pipe? It is also oily.

Is the bus bad to drive, even if I keep putting oil in it?
Thanks all,
Pete
