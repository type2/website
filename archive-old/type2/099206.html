Subject: Re: [T2] compression low

Mike ,,
You need to tell us if you checked the valve clearances,, 
I take it they are hydraulic ?

If you could do a leak down test,, it might help you alot also
Search online ,, google_dot_com leak down test  

CHEAP Quasi leak down test for those without a real tester
Look at your compression gauge, see how it threads in to the spark plug hole,
Find a way to remove the gauge and use the hose to apply compressed air into the
spark plug hole
set the engine at #1 TDC, and put air into the cylinder
Listen at the AFM for air leaking past the intake valve... any air is bad
Listen at the tail pipe for air leaking past the exhaust valve... any air is bad
Listen at the oil filler with the lid open, for air leaking past the rings,, you
will hear some air leaking as rings always leak a bit
Listen for air leaking past the cyl to head seating surface underneath the
engine
Repeat for 2,3,4.
