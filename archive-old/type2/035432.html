Subject: Snow/Ice Driving Impressions

Hello All. I have just had the pleasure of taking my ' 78 Westy out for a 
little drive in the most horrendous driving conditions that central NC has 
seen in all of recorded history. All I can say is &quot;Wow!!!&quot;. This machine goes 
through snow, ice, slush, curbs&lt;it was burried under 20 inches of snow&gt; 
etc...I even had the unique experience of pulling a big macho 4wd truck out 
of the ditch. A very humbling thing for the driver of said vehicle, to be 
sure! I am frankly dumbstruck by the westy's  ability to navigate through 
what I thought were un-drivable conditions. I've spent the past two days 
giving our local medical personel lifts to and from their respective jobs, 
and they too are completly impressed. A State Patrol Officer wanted to buy it 
from me on the spot on Tuesday morning, after I had stopped to offer HIM 
assistance! The only non-stock items on the bus are the 27/8.5/14 Futura 
Durango A/T tires, and a set of KYB dampeners. Absolutly Fabulous! I cant 
imagine what these little beasties would have been capable of doing if they 
were ever equipt with 4 wheel drive. It would be mind boggling, indeed. BTW, 
my heat also works very well, thanks in no small part to all of you on the 
list.
Having altogether too much fun,
Stray  ' 78 std. 2.0L FI Westy
