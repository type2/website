Subject: RE: Type 2 Cabin heat

There seems to be a general concenus from the list that 12 volt heaters are
not worth bothering with. I have a 12 volt 10 amp fan heater which makes no 
impression at all on the temperature.

I recently made a post saying that I was going to insulate the heater pipe 
forward of the front chassis cross member and block off the pipe that goes to 
the tiny heater at the rear of my 'loaf' walkthrough.

I did both of these the other weekend and have found a definite increase in 
hot air (volume and temperature) up the front.

Although its by no means cold over here in England at the moment I actualy
turned the heater off because I was warm enough the other day!

The next plan, on the heater front, is to install a thermostaticaly controlled
air recirculation system....
