Mime-Version: 1.0

&gt;&gt; &gt;I have been to the dealership across the river in
&gt;&gt; &gt;Nuevo Laredo and they have always been nice and
&gt;&gt; &gt;helpful. They even gave me a partsbook! 
&gt;&gt; &gt;On one occasion they looked up ambulance fans for me
&gt;      ^^^^^^^^^^^^^
&gt;
&gt;&gt; Note they gave you a free reference, spent their time to help find what you
&gt;&gt; wanted, in your words, &quot;nice and friendly&quot;, and in return they get NO SALE,
&gt;&gt; value not recognized by market. You may appreciate their attitude and thank

Read on...........You may appreciate their attitude and thank them for
their help. Some of the market (ie; others than you) will call them crooks
as they leave with the freebee information.

Message being, those parts people get reactions good, bad and ugly to their
efforts, and they don't set the prices nor do they make the decisions which
parts become NLA. 

&gt;
&gt;hey doc, give the guy a break, he apparently is a regular customer, I know
&gt;I know I don't buy EVERYTHING I price but buy enough and the folks don't
&gt;mind a few searches.

Know also how many times I contact the dealer to get price/availabliity for
a potential client and get the same reactions. I'm a crook as far as some
of them are concerned, like I have some control over the price. Hopefully,
they won't be back to take more of my time and advice so they don't have to
pay for my services. I give every courtesy to those who follow up and buy
some goods or services from time to time. But those who call the third time
and still no sale I won't take the effort next time to diagnose over the
phone the solution to their problem so they don't have to come to the shop
and suffer the possibility that I might write up an invoice and expect them
to pay for value received. It takes all types to make a world. I extend
courtesy up to the point that it becomes apparrent it is not appreciated. I
expect some VWoA dealer parts people develop a simlar attitude to a more or
less degree. Few of them are indifferent to anyone perceived as a real
client.
