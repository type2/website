Mr Haynes, in common with the near-deity Mr Muir, is not infallible.  The
information in the manual is wrong and relates to the upright engine, which
has a different temperature thermostat.

+AD4- Haynes says in my manual which will cover your engine that 
+AD4- you test at 65-70
+AD4- degrees C. The thermostat should open to a minimum of 46 mm.
