I ordered an AVP engine in October of last year and installed it in
November. I now have 3,200 miles on it without any AVP related difficulties.
It still does not run perfectly, but through trial and error and the
technical assistance (and entertainment!) of the list I truly believe that I
will achieve mastery over my vehicle, an 83 air-cooled Westfalia,
&quot;Hammurabi.&quot;

I was in Sacramento the last part of last week and on behalf of myself and
the list I paid AVP a visit, unannounced.

They are not easy to find, as the listed address in the phone book does not
correspond to the actual physical location of the business. I drove
earnestly up and down the boulevard in vain several times before I intuited
that the numbers go down, then up again to the place where they are not.
But, at the Harley shop at the listed address they knew where the shop is
located and the gentleman behind the counter there scurried out, gave me
directions and had me out of the shop before the resident Hells Angels
(Sacramento, you know) could get their dander up sufficiently to kick my
a**. I really did not want to hang out there anyway.

I drove up the shop, big sign AVP International, and went inside. Leonard
greeted me with a kindly smile. The waiting area is a stand up space of
approx 8 square feet. The reception (Office) area is where he, and only he,
apparently assembles engines. We talked for a while, and he remembered that
I had called in need of a specific piece of engine tin. He said, 'This is
the good part of owning your own business, come with me.' He locked the door
and we mounted up in his old Dodge 4WD Diesel Simon and Simon Truck and took
off for his Private Junkyard. We poked around there for about twenty minutes
looking unsuccessfully for the piece that I needed. We came back to the shop
and he showed me around the entire operation.

AVP is smaller in scope than I might have anticipated, but I was happily
surprised. It is a true cottage operation run by a fellow who knows what he
is doing, and does it himself. He had a young assistant there that I did not
have the opportunity to speak to, but appeared to be a very intelligent
young man. The young assistant does all of the prep work, limited machine
work, and core evaluation. Erin collates all of the pieces of the engines,
and Leonard does the final assembly. I did not witness the final steps of
engine dyno testing at the facility, so this must be performed at another
location. It was apparent that my specific engine had been tested, so I feel
confident that this must be the case. I did not ask.

I believe, after visiting his shop that he is a competent rebuilder and
worthy of the money I spent on my engine.
