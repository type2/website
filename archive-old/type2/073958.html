&lt;&lt; As for first gear - I shift it into 2nd first then it slides right into
first (couldn't go into first with out doing that). May not fix the actuall
problem but it works for me. &gt;&gt;

Sounds like a non-synchro first (owners of older LBC's will recognize the
technique). Try letting the clutch out in neutral, blipping the throttle, and
then sliding into first (double-clutching on a down shift). Or...replace the
synchros...
