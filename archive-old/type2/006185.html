The Appalacian VW Assoc (Ermal Washam and his hench people) put on one heck
of a VW show/campout in Severville Tn this weekend. They hold &quot;Circle Ur
Wagons&quot; twice a year..this was #9..and it just keeps getting bigger and
better. All sorts of VW's, a gazzilion show cars, if you're into that, a
vehicle sales area, commercial vendors and swap people galore. There were
more used parts available than at the 2 Farmington NC shows I've been
to..and that show is known for the parts availability.

Can't imagine you'd need a part that wasn't there. (Personally picked up
both bumpers..with brackets for our 69 Ghia..$20 each/ shroud with entire
flap system...finally! for an upright $10/ pristine 71 bus fuel tank, with
new sender and filler tube, complete with cap..$15 (Don't need this right
now..but couldn't passs it up)/ whole bus light assemblies, with lenses..$5
and the list goes on. Advantage of type 2 campers: you're in the compound
(on the banks of the Little Pigeon River) way before the gates open for the
hordes who attend. Add the great free meal on sat night, live band, engine
blow, helicopter rides, and this years feature..live professional
wrestling...wait- that goes on the debit side:), and you can see why this is
one of the premier events in the East. I think the spring one is in Apr or
May...check the AVWA website. If you live in this section..you really need
to come to this.

Regards, Marv Krupp...lots of parts...and real broke.
