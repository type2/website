I have a 72 Type II.  For the last few months, she will develop a problem
that comes and goes.  When you turn the key, everything works but the
starter.  Dash lights light, aux functions function but the starter does
nothing.  Not being the sage mechanic, I decided the starter was bad. 
(previous owner said it was the original)   I replaced it and the problem
went away for about a month.  Then it came back.   I then checked and
cleaned the ground connection at the suggestion of a local shade tree
mechanic.  Problem gone for another 30 days.  Last month, it came back!!!
 This time, out of desperation I replaced the ignition switch and yes I
got another 30 days.    Yesterday, it came back and I have run out of
ideas.  Any suggestions?
