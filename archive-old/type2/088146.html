Yo Mike

As I said - he is asking $1500.00 Canadian - but I'm sure they are open to
offers.  It's about 1/2 hour North of Brockville - you are close to Montreal
right? It's not that far.  As I said - it doesn't run - so I'm not sure how
you'd move it.  But if you are still interested lemme know and I'll send the
email address.

BTW - how is the Mango bus coming alone?

&gt;
&gt; I know of a 72 hard top standard bus in eastern Ontario.  If your old
&gt; bus  moved to NY it could easily have crossed the border into Ontario.
&gt; I had the VIN but I seemed to have misplaced it.  This 72 that I know of
&gt; has an amazingly solid body but doesn't run and is for sale - cheap
&gt; cheap cheap.
