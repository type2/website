I've got a 2L in a 75 westy and I've set the timing statically according 
to muir. It backfires a little but otherwise runs fine. should I screw 
with it ? It doesen't sem to run hot.The points are set a little bit snug 
on .016.When I time it by ear it ends up around 12* BTDC although it 
should be at 7.5. I,ve sort of compromised I guess I'm around 9 now.Should 
I reset the points? I'm planning a 200 mile road trip and don't want to do 
any damage.
