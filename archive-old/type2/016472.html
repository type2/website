Subject: Strange Baywindow...

    Kinda in keeping with the thread about the small pop-top westfalia
conversions... I spotted a White Baywindow yesterday that has a rather
large square pop-top (I'm going to look at it again today and find out
more info)

    At a glance it has a top that is about 3.5' long and from rain
gutter to rain gutter.  This is pretty close to the middle of the bus.

    Hopefully someone there will talk to me, when I stop by this
morning...

        JonR
