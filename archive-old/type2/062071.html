Subject: FS: '71 European Westy w/gas heater

I've decided to sell my '71 for the best offer I can get in the next two
Still needs some paint up near the windshield since there's a
little rust that needs to be repaired. The windshield is scratched, so I
was waiting to replace it to do the job. I have extra paint to finish the
job.

Here's the scoop:

Aqua - non-stock color...I painted it myself and you can tell. This is no
show bus, but it looks decent. I cut out and sanded out rust before
painting it. Painted the interior to match the exterior. I did the job to
preserve the bus and improve its looks some. Has some bondo which can be
detected visually, though not until you get up close--hey, I did my best.
Complete westy interior with European-style bunk up top--this goes all
the way across...like a double bed, instead of being a cot. Needs front
seat covers. Still needs some paint up near the windshield since there's a
little rust that needs to be repaired. The windshield is scratched, so I
was waiting to replace it to do the job. I have extra paint to finish the
job.

Currently, some of the paneling is out of the bus, but none of it is
trashed. I took it out for painting and was toying with the idea of
refinishing it...though I never got around to it. Some of the paneling was
painted over by the PO, so you'll want to do something with that...either
repaint, strip, or replace. The sink and closet are out too, but waiting
to go back in. The closet has a speaker hole in it. I have built a box
where the closet used to be and the same speaker is installed into that
box. You can put the closet back in if you want to, of course.

Good tires, brakes, engine, tranny.  Shifts stiff if you don't time it
right, but doesn't pop out of gear (I think it's the shifter coupling, and
I have the part, but haven't installed it).  Once you get the timing down,
it shifts fine. 

The canvas is not original, but it's decent...bug-tight, camoflauge
pattern. No roof or luggage rack seals on the bus.  

The engine is a recent top-end &quot;rebuild.&quot; I used parts I had, including
relatively new (1000 miles) pistons &amp; jugs. I didn't get the pushrod tubes
sealed properly, so it leaks there. If I can steal some time, I'll be
working on this soon. I haven't done a compression test on this engine,
but it sounds powerful and I plan to do the test and will inform
interested parties. I'll be willing to include a rebuildable engine with
the bus as well, though that one has excessive end play and would need
align-boring. The end play on the engine in the bus is 0.003. I also
haven't gotten the carb &amp; timing adjusted right on this engine yet, but I
will next time I steal an afternoon from my kids. The heads looked almost
new, but I lapped them in with valve grinding compound anyway.

New clutch, pressure plate, and lightened flywheel--I picked these up at
an auction, so I don't have much $$ into them. This is the good stuff,
though. The clutch cable needs to be tightened, but man, this thing really
grabs! (My old clutch had gotten oily and slick...I'll bet I was losing
mounds of power.)

Gas heater is supposed to work, but I've still never run it. I somehow
managed to disconnect some wires...I've been in the dash, so I think
that's where I did it...and I haven't figured out how to feed juice to the
heater properly...so I haven't messed with it. I have the manual for the
heater, I just haven't pursued it past the staring at it in awe stage. 

The ignition switch (electrical part) needs to be replaced. I have the
part but again, haven't gotten around to it.

One of the tail lights doesn't work. This is a crazy problem. I've got
juice to the bulb contacts, the bulb is good, and when I plug it in, it
doesn't work. Hmmmm.....it may not be grounding properly.

Well, if you're interested even after I pointed out all of these flaws,
maybe you're the right candidate for ownership. I've put a lot of time and
$$$ into the bus, so I don't want to sell it to someone who's going to
drop the ball. It's not a basketcase...or even close to it. I have a box
of extra parts too, some of which can go with the bus...some of which
can't. All the lenses on the bus are in good shape except the front turn
lenses, which are fair. I have the front windshield seal waiting for
replacement glass. The ventwing in the back leaked, but I have a junkyard
replacement for it (it's currently siliconed into place to stop leaking).
The driver's side window rollup mechanism is GONE. The PO installed a rope
contraption that works, but you'll eventually want to replace it.

Thanks! Joe
