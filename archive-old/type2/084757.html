Subject: Re: [WetWesties] What's the correct reply?

At 00:35 2/13/2002 +0000, you wrote:

&gt;Seattle area)
======================&gt;
Smile, pause, and then say
&quot;Yup, it's nice to know there's still good people out there&quot;.

That response either flatters them, of throws it back in their face; 
whatever their thoughts were to begin with.

Works every time.

To kids,
I say,
&quot;Hey, work hard, play nice, don't spend your money on junk, and you can 
grow up to be the same.&quot;

Again,
Works every time.
