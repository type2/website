Subject: Re: [T2] Early Bay Seat replacement

NOT A CRTICISM - but... I have never seen a factory seat belt that shared the same bolt for the shoulder belt and the retractor...

Is that safe? 1 bolt handles all the stress of a crash, 2 handle 50% each I think. I need to go home and refresh my memory about how the factory belts are done. Can't remember...

GREAT install. I went with Vanagon seats but did some very serious looking at some Golf seats I had for the same install. Those Jetta/Golf seats are SO comfortable. I am going to use them in our Beetle eventually. 

Congrats! Saving your pics for future reference.
