Subject: fr. wheel bearings

     Wel,, yesterday Lea and I were going to have a look-see at her front 
     wheel bearings and brakes BUT the outer bearings wouldn't budge, 
     either side.  I even used the big rubber mallet on the tire AND a 
     small punch against the center of the bearings.  They are stuck, a 
     permanent part of the spindle maybe!  I put it all back together and 
     took it to the only shop in town that I trust and asked them if they 
     had a drum and/or inside bearing puller and would they be willing to 
     bust the old bearings off and give it back to me to do the rest.  No 
     problem, they say, just give us two days.  Cool.  Hopefully, the 
     spindle won't be damaged but I'm not counting on it.  Are these 
     available other than junkyard?  I should start looking now just in 
     case.  Buzz me privately if you know where I can purchase new 
     spindles.  I curse the ever hateful PO!!!!!!  If I learn anything 
     really good, I'll post the list.
     Thanks  Ray   Gainesville, FL
