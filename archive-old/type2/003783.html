Subject: Re: Auxillary Battery: Circuit Breaker(s)??
Message-ID: &lt;003c01beb882$cc43b080$4d59fed0_at_default&gt;

&gt;
&gt;Do I need one? or more?
&gt;If so, do I install it between the batteries and the connections on the
&gt;relay???
&gt;or does it go between the aux. battery and the outlet I will plugging
&gt;my inverter into?


You shouldn't need a circuit breaker as long as you are going to use fuses
between the battery and whatever the battery is going to power... they do
the same job but fuses are a whole lot cheaper :)
