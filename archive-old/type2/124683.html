Subject: No trip report and CV Joints

Buenos Dias, Roberto,

I don't think any production VW bus ever came with a limited-slip 
differential... so that means if any one of your four CV joints breaks, your 
bus does not go.

Chevrolet marketed a car called the NOVA years ago, and could not understand 
why it failed to sell in Spanish-speaking countries, where as you know NO-VA 
means no-go ;-))

Moving right along...  It has been a long time since I did CV joint work on a 
VW, but I do remember a lot of discussion about extending the life of the CV 
joints by interchanging the right and left shaft+CV assemblies.  The idea is to 
reverse the loading on the joint.  If the shafts are of equal lengths, the 
procedure takes just a short time.  When I did mine [on BMW] I liked to paint 
arrows showing forward motion rotation on the shafts.  These arrows would 
remind me of the direction of rotation... also helping to avoid confusion as I 
reinstalled the assemblies left to right.  A few years later, when I could not 
remember if I had reversed the shafts, a quick look would tell me.  If the 
arrows indicated backing motion, I knew it was time for another change.

Possibly someone on the List can advise if your shafts are of equal lengths.

Glenn

..The job was pretty simple using the workshop book instruction, the only
problem was I toke apart a CV joint to packed of grease and in the rush I
put togheter in a wrong way ( it is amazing how hard is to make a new CV
joint move in comparsion with the old ones), I made my self to redo the
thing an after a few hours of a very stept learning curve I put the bus on
the road againg but unfortunaly we have to back home due to the heavy rains.
At the end of the story a few things comes up, first always keep a 6mm allen
wrench with you (I thougt is one of the fews you wiil need in a VW bus),
after cleaned I inspected the olds joint and found that perhaps the terrible
sound that they made I think they can last longer if you are far of a safe
place to work (I would like to hear from you on that point).

&gt;This situation made me think in what could happen if I keep the bus rolling
with the CV calcking, and after it is fall apart could the bus still rolling
just with one side axle working?
