Subject: FS : Complete Sportsmobile interior!

Hello all! We have to part with our 71 Sportsmobile camper (the bus has
already rust away!) The top is gone, but we still have the complete
interior; with the working 2 way fridge, all the groovy yellowish
padding, the interior is perfect except for the Z-bed base which has non
original holes for 6x9 speakers. If anyone is interested just p-mail me.

Yannick

P.S.: If I'm believing the original sales brochures, I'm also missing
the small garbage can.
