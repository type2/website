Subject: Re: [T2] Hi Listers I'm Back!!! need engine info...

My bus had a beetle engine it with one of those brackets. I put 17000 miles
on it with no problems at all. That said, I'm putting in an engine with the
threaded holes in the universal cases, and I plan to keep it that way.

&lt;I have to disagree a little here Karl.
It does mount to the oil pump studs but also bolts through a lower case
bolt.
Given a choice of using a good bug motor with the bracket or spending over
1K for a new motor I would use the bracket.
Yes a bus motor is better. But the brackets work. Ive seen them in action
and have not actually seen one fail.&gt;
