Subject: brake issues

------=_NextPart_001_0000_01C12E7D.51242EC0

Does anyone out there know where a guy could get new or used backing plat=
es for the rear brakes of a '69 Westy? Somehow my bus ended up with ones =
from a later model and they don't work with the shoes and drums of a '69.=
 Big problems. Perhaps the hub and drums of a 71 or later might work..any=
one know for sure?
Thanks in advance,
Jeff
