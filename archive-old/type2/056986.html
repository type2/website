Subject: Need a Helicoil for a '82 Temp Sensor?

Long story made short: 
My '82 Vanagon suffered from a massive loss of power every now and then to 
just plain no power... replaced fuel filter, fuel pump, and a friend checked 
the complete FI - was OK... problem went away but then came back. Found out 
the the Temp Sensor was cross-threaded and was causing the intermittent 
problem.
Anyways had to go to my local NAPA store and have them order a &quot;Helicoil 
Thread Repair System&quot; so I could screw in the Temp Sensor. Don't need it any 
more, used only once so 11 of the 12 inserets are still in the package.
Will sell it for a third of what I overpaid for it: $20 plus $2 for postage.

'71 Westy-resurrection in progress, '75 Bug-actually 99% restored, '76 Pinto 
wagon-daily driver, '82 Vanagon-the faithful workhorse which everyone wants 
to borrow to move stuff with, and the 3 Vespas (still in parts thought) for 
spares
