Hi Courtney -

&gt;&gt; Has anyone
ever come up with a way to actually beat this
problem??

Some might frown at this &quot;non-OEM solution&quot;, but mine was pretty
shot anyway, so I just painted over it. Maybe when the
flocking was original,
it worked well, but it had seen better days - patches of it were crumbling
off.  If you do this, make sure you scrape off any loose stuff (messy, and
probably a health hazard) and use a
waterproof paint, sice it gets wet with
condensation.
