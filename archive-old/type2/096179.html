probably burning off the assembly materials and the greasy fingerprints on
the exhaust etc, but keep an eye on it.  however coming from the vents on
the back pillers is a concern, was the engine on???  that is the intake
for the cooling air nothing should be coming out, cool air should be going
in while the engine is running.
