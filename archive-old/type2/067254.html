&gt;long - it's kinda like sitting still with the engine running. Unless
&gt;there's a strong wind, you just sit there in the exhaust.

&gt;Never have fumes in the bus - but to just sit there with it running for
&gt;hours in a campsite would be HEINOUS! Then you would need a second

Hey, Kath - you shoulda bought a Eberspacher!  :&lt;)
Seriously folks, a properly running gas heater is PERFECTLY SAFE to use while
camping. ( Now, if you're idea of camping is in the garage with the door closed,
then that could be a problem)  A second battery would be a good idea if it is to
be used all night, but with the thermostat, the timer will shut itself off when
the bus is warm, so it will not run continuously all night if you don't want it
to. As far as ehaust, a running 4 cyl engine puts out quite a bit more exhaust
than a gas heater.    Quite a bit.
