On 1/27/00 2:13 PM, Postal8888_at_aol_dot_com thus spake:

&gt;Durango A/T tires, and a set of KYB dampeners. Absolutly Fabulous! I cant 
&gt;imagine what these little beasties would have been capable of doing if they 
&gt;were ever equipt with 4 wheel drive. It would be mind boggling, indeed. BTW, 

Trivia: there were something like 7-8 of them made with 4WD, as concept 
vehicles, but they never went into production. Good picture of one of 
them catching some air off a sand dune in the book &quot;The VW Story&quot;. Alas, 
for production 4WD, one is forced to go with the Vanagon Synchro, or some 
sort of FrankenBus...


Peace,
