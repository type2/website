Subject: Re[2]: M-Code location for 62 flip seat Westy

     
     
     I found the m-code plate.  The m-code plate for a 62 flip seat 
     Westfalia camper is under the cab bench seat on the passenger side.  
     My plate reads:
     
     11 04 2
     367 D34
     HO 231 SK1032 931388
     
     The m-code plate is screwed and painted in place.  It doesn't look 
     transplanted.  The &quot;1&quot; in SK1032 could be an &quot;I&quot;.  The &quot;D&quot; in D34 is 
     clearly a &quot;D&quot;.  
     
     
     I understand the date of manufacture, 367 = bus, and 931388 is the 
     chassis number.  I'm really interested in getting the paint codes. The 
     bus is blue.  
     
     Does anyone know how to read the rest of this?

This is a good question that I don't know the correct answer for.  
     
The 1962-63 SO-34 &amp; SO-35 Westfalias were interesting conversions.  
They were made from walk-thru Kombis.  Westfalia cut the bulkheads 
behind the seats off at the base and fitted a &quot;flip&quot; bench seat 
over the two seat bases.  The VIN plate with m-code info was on 
the bulkhead behind the passenger seat that was &quot;thrown away&quot;.  
     
In 1962-63 the VIN plate was still attached by screws so it seems 
possible (and probable) that Westfalia &quot;relocated&quot; the VIN plate.  I 
have only seen a handful of these campers and only one nice one.  I 
have never looked for a VIN plate in one.  I know of a pretty 
stripped (no useable camper parts) '63 SO-35 in a junkyard in 
Alabama that I will see again in about a month, and will look in it.
     
Is there anyone out there with a '62-63 Westy that can answer this 
before then?

&gt;I have a 1962 &quot;flip seat&quot; Westfalia camper.  I'm told it's an S034 
&gt;Westfalia interior.  I'm curious about finding the VW model code 
&gt;plate.  I tried to follow the directions on the NEATO web page but I 
&gt;still haven't found a model plate.  
&gt;     
&gt;In my bus, there is no wall behind the front seat dividing the cab 
&gt;from the cargo area.  The front seat back flips over to the face the 
&gt;interior of the bus when camping.  The camper is based on a 62 
&gt;walkthrough and was picked up in Germany in 1962 by my father in law.
