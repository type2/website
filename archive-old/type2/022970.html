&gt;so, how do you rig up a standard stove in a westy to a colman bottle of 
&gt;propane?  this seems like a better alternative than getting an underbelly tank.

I *just* got done removing my exterior tank and converting the stove to run 
on a bottle.  What you need is a Coleman adaptor for this purpose, which I 
found at a Coleman outlet store here in Texas for about $20.  It converts 
the small bottle opening to a regulated 1/4&quot;id hose output, which you can 
then splice into your existing stove line (mine had 1/4&quot; hose output).  BE 
CAREFUL doing this.  It has to be reliable to be safe.  I used a barbed 
brass fitting to join the hose, which is special hose made for these 
applications, and clamped it down well with good quality hoseclamps.  I 
also ran the line to a cabinet well away from the stove, and I unhook the 
bottle when the stove is not in use.
