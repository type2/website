&gt; While doing some work on the ol' bus today I crawled under to see how bad the
&gt; steering coupler was. As suspected it was cracked and needs to be replaced.

Someone sent me this photo a while back and I saved it. Was it this bad? ;-)

&gt; Anyone know the size of the
&gt; bolts off hand so I can get some new ones before I start?

The bolts are M8 35mm long. There are washers on each side of the coupler.

I haven't surveyed all the vendors but the Bus Boys coupler is the el cheapo
Mexican one for $15. OEVeedub has the real deal from Germany for $20 (we at
least know it lasts 25+ years).
