Hurray!  Celebration!

I use that subject based on the Bosch FI manual that states it means
&quot;Fuel Injection&quot; in German.  It may be profanity for all I know, which
might explain the message I got from Al Brase:-).

On Monday I completed the installation of a homebrewed, cobbled
together, not-quite-duct-tape CIS fuel injection installation on my 71
1600DP mostly stock engine.  

I started with the intake from a 76 FI b**tle.  The manifold ends were
modified to hold the CIS injectors using off-the-shelf 3/8 MPT X 1/4
COMPRESSION fittings.  The fuel distributor was a Rabbit unit mounted on
the oil bath cleaner stand.  A fuel pump/accumulator mounting from a BMW
525 was mounted on the frame rail behind the passenger rear tire. The
fuel pressure accumulator was attached to the block using a
fabricated(read hammer modified) mount attached to the rear main bearing
stud just behind the thermostat.  A few modifications were needed for
the gas tank supply and the return.  

The result is extreme low end torque, excellent throttle response, great
cold starting, and what appears to be better gas mileage.  (I'm just
draining the first tank).  I cant believe it, but I'm considering the
need for some taller gearing:-).

It took me about a year to cobble the pieces together.  Numerous trips
were made to a junkyard with lots of European cars.  I started the
actual install about 7 weekends ago.  I have to say, I only drove about
200 feet before I knew it was all worth it.  I used a hill close to home
to compare.  I was previously stuck at that awkard spot between 3 and
4th.  You early bus owners know what I mean.  Too fast to rev higher,
but no grunt in 4th, keeping me about 37 indicated mph.  Yesterday I hit
it full throttle. I let off when I passed 50 mph:-)!


The CIS System is very simple to understand and fairly simple to swap
from other cars (as far as swaps go).  And most owners with cars
equipped with the system comment on the reliability.  For you FI owners,
it should be pretty straight forward.  As you can tell, I'm very pleased
so far.  I've now got a much smoother idling, quiter, and much more
powerful engine.  I'll keep you updated as to the long term reliability,
for those of you interested.  

I do need to thank Scott Frasier for his extensive patience with me and
Patric Marcum for providing parts.

See you down the road.

Soon, I hope.
