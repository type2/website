Subject: Need photos for a list-sticker!!!

All,

Yep, I'm working on some artwork for a future
type2_dot_com list sticker!

You can see my first effort by going to the following
page (ignore the text; it's intended for the listee
who's offered to do the actual printing):
http://www.futureone_dot_com/~jcnkb2/sticker.html

Of all the people who've seen the above artwork, only
Ken Hooper didn't complain about having a splitty on
their window;-) Soooooo...

...I'm doing a &quot;Generations&quot; theme: a 23-window
splitty, a loaf Westfalia, and an A/C Vanagon,
side-by-side. I'll either do it in a front view, or a
3/4 view (from the passenger side). 

For the purpose of getting the perspective right, I
need photos of a splitty (doesn't have to be a
23-window...I can do that) and a Vanagon. I can use my
'69 for the loaf. I need both views...front and
passenger 3/4. It can be an ugly, dented, rusty,
hot-pink and emerald colored bus...it doesn't matter;
it's just for perspective.

Better still, if someone has (or knows where to find
on the net), a photo of these three busses *together*,
that'd be great! And no, I can't use the image from
the Bus Boys site (sorry).

Also, the photos need to be saved in .jpg format,
otherwise, I can't re-size them without getting
severely jagged edges (like in .gif format). I will
also need them to be fairly large so that I can resize
them....I can resize smaller than original, but not
larger.

Any help will be greatly appreciated!
