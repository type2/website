peoples assessment will  be different, especially taking into account
the implications of an unexpectedly extended trip a a result of a
breakdown- this could mean anything from  financial disaster or a
welcome opportunity to extend a trip and make some new friends
depending on your situation...

Don't know about other posts..but that's exactly what I said.

&gt;The other thing is that the fact that you paid $400 for a bus doesn't
mean it's a $400 bus. The volk on this list are going to be the ones
that pick up bargains and have the spares and expertise to build a
reliable vehicle out of someone elses &quot;unreliable POS&quot;.
If you've had a bus for six months, replaced worn out parts with
ones that would have cost hundreds of dollars to source professionally
and invested a couple of hundred hours in preventative maintenance
and basic renovation, you can't really describe it as a $400 bus: it's
a $3000 bus that you bought for $400!!!

In my case, I bought a $400 bus that IS a $400 bus (campout attendees in the 
Mid-Atlantic will confirm this :)..or maybe :(. In the 53K we now have on 
it, I replaced the front disc brakes..and other than tuneup stuff..nothing 
else. It's NOT (and never will be as long as I'm the owner :) a $3000 bus 
and my point was that there are some pretty reliable junkers out there..that 
do not need a bunch of bucks tossed at them..unless you're a resto-freak. I 
also agree it's easier to be more cavalier about your wheels when you don't 
have a set schedule of arrivals and departures.

IMHO, those who can afford the ready-to-go busses..should go for it. But for 
those who can't..VW reliability, even in 30 year old busses, can be 
good..and long trips can be enjoyed.
