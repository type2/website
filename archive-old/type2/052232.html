Subject: [T2] RE: Setting Total Advance Without Degree Wheel

Some scientist type will probably knock this full of holes but it seems to
work for me.  I have a timing light (from Pep Boys) that has a timing
adjustment knob on the end.  I set the knob at whatever I want the total
advance to be (say 30 degrees).  Then rev the engine up to where there is no
more advance.  Leave it revved up and adjust the distributor so that the 0
degree timing mark lines up with the case halves.  All the while, you are
pointing the timing light at the pulley so you can see the light flashing
when the timing mark matches the case halves.  Now, when you set the timing
light back to whatever initial advance should be, the light should flash on
the correct timing mark (for your distributor) at idle.  I find this reverse
method particularly useful with a 009 since it requires a different initial
advance than what most pulleys have marked.  You always want total advance
between 28 and 32 so, if you find that first, you find initial advance at
the same time.

&gt; 
&gt; The pulley has a notch at 0 deg, 7.5 deg BTDC, and 10 deg BTDC.
&gt; With the notches at the top of the pulley, the 0 deg notch is the
&gt; leftmost one. Get a string and use it to measure the distance from
&gt; the 0 notch to the 10 notch. Now measure off that same distance
&gt; from the 10 notch and you are at 20 deg BTDC. Put a mark there
&gt; with a pen, liquid paper, or whatever. Now measure the distance
&gt; from the 20 mark (that you just made) and you are at 30 deg BTDC.
&gt; Put a mark there as well. Measure it all again to make sure it
&gt; is right. When you are sure, use the edge of a file to make
&gt; yourself a new notch at 30 degrees.
