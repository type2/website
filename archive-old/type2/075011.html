Subject: Re: [T2] 68-73 Westy Closet/Cabinet mods.


&gt;Adam wants to cut the top off of the closet/cupboard unit in his westy and
&gt;shorten it down enough so that it won't block the passenger side rear
&gt;window. This way it will still provide some storage space and will also
&gt;allow lots of light and visibility. It seems like all we will have to do is
&gt;take a saw to the cabinets and splice the top back into the remaining
&gt;cabinets...

I'm afraid I've never done this, but it sounds like a very workable, very 
good idea to me. My own project this summer involves chopping my z-bed in a 
very similar way; cutting out a middle section of it and re-attaching the 
sides, to shorten it so that I can put my sink next to it, in the rear. It's 
a mad scheme, but carefully executed, I think both our plans would work well 
and result in a pair of very nice custom campers.
