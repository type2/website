&gt;That is usually caused by the wire from the &quot;g&quot; post on the sending unit
&gt;grounding out.  I'd check electrical connections before anything else.

actually, ground at the VDO sender  is a &quot;zero read &quot; on the gauge, and it'\s
an open circuit that pegs the gauge...

&gt;That being said, here's an odd posibility:  Check to make sure the big ground
&gt;strap on the transmission has a good connection to the frame.  Sounds weird,
&gt;but has been the culpret in many a strange problem.

if you are reading this, here's another item for your list of things to do... this means you !
