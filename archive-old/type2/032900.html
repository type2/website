Subject: Nice people...good people

Dear List Members,

Please, please, can we quit being so prissy? Everyone here has something
to contribute and tolerance is tolerance which means we have to get
along with people we don't agree with. Don't have to like, just
tolerate. Live and let live...that sort of thing. :-)

VW content: Speaking of nice people :-) if you need a really good
mechanic who will work with you on tough problems and you live within
striking distance of Smyrna, GA. John, Toby and Dr. Jimmy at Import
Services and Restoration (ph: (770) 434-4093) are THE BEST! Tell them
Gus sent you ;-). They also have all kinds of hard to get parts.

Pacifically (pontifically?)  yours,

Chris and Gus (the &quot;Got Heat?&quot; bus)  in Atlanta
