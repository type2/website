I hate to say it but you might as well sing as to the 
quality of sound. I ran a old fujitsu high powered 
cassette deck in my 74 westy with 2 150 watt 6x9's 
under the bed and a zoom tube sub in a cabinet 
I built btween the seats. I got excellent sound.
As for the remark that you would get bad sound
because the van is a rolling box,   remember you 
living room is square and if you put great sound 
in  you will get great sound out
