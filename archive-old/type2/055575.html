Subject: instrument panel removal

On my '71 Westy,  I need to remove the instrument panel from the dashboard
in order to get at the wires for a new ignition switch that I'm installing.
The end pieces of the four heater/vent contol levers prevent this panel
from being lifted out.

Bentley suggests removing the plastic plugs that hold the end pieces to the
levers.  If experience is any guide, I expect those plugs to crack as I try
to force them back through their holes,  assuming that I can contort my
wrist to get at them with the pliers.

Has anyone successfully removed these plugs without breaking them?
Is there an alternate way to get the panel off?  For example, can the
blue/red rubber tips on the end pieces be removed?  Will this allow the end
pieces to slip through the slots in the panel?

Thanks for any help.

Jack
