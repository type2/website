Subject: Kill this thread: [Re: Any Web Page Professionals out there?]

Please kill this thread.

To refresh memories and help newbies, please remember that messages about
toys and sightings and waving and such are not appropriate except on
Fridays, Fridays do not endure for more than 24 hours, and it is never
appropriate to post messages that amount to idle chitchat (yes, not even
when I do it =^ ). We maintain a chat server specifically for that purpose:

	irc.type2_dot_com

Thanks,
