Subject: Re: [T2] Floppy vent wing- how to tighten?

Bill,

Tried that method when I put my 78 back together.  I ended up splitting 
part of the rivet.

Here is what worked better for me...

I had a round punch that is actually pretty blunt nosed but still had 
a center point on it

Put the flat side of the rivet on the flat part of my vice, had the
wife hold everything upright and then just tapped the punch down into the 
rivet a couple of times with a hammer.

Looked like factory.

Cheers, dave

&gt; While on the subject of vent wing pivots, I will be reassembling mine
&gt; shortly and was wondering what the preferred tool is for crimping the new
&gt; top rivet? I was thinking of using  a strong pair of pliers and a BB stuck
&gt; into the rivet hole in order to spread the rivet wall.
