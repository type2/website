I have a Blaupunkt Las Vegas model CD player in my 77.

We put the wire to the fusebox to the taillight fuse (#11 I think), and mine
has an inline fuse. We just used the inline fuse holder from the previous
stereo.
The bolt and nut on the back are for a support bar, if you use one. I had
one existing with the previous stereo. The deck should have come with some
sort of sleeve that will attempt to keep it from sliding back and forth.

Hope this helps

&gt; I have a blaupunkt am/fm radio I would like to install it in my
&gt; 72 van (it
&gt; seems correct for the period).
&gt;
&gt; However, all I have are about two inches of cut wire coming out form the
&gt; back of the radio that should go to the speaker. I can tell
&gt; because of the
&gt; picture on the back of the radio. I can see where the ground wire should
&gt; attach, it is the male connector sticking out close to the antenna hole.
&gt;
&gt; I am not sure where the wire that shows &quot;+12V&quot; should go. I imagine that
&gt; goes to the fuse box? But which fuse is best to use? Bentley's
&gt; manual is not
&gt; helpful.  I have also heard that the wire that goes to the fuse
&gt; box should
&gt; have an inline fuse. Is this correct? and if so, what size fuse?
&gt;
&gt; Finally, should the radio reside in some type of bracket? or is
&gt; the bolt and
&gt; nut sticking out the back meant to be used as a support?
