wondering if anyone could give me ballpark prices and maybe a list of all I need to do
to the '77 to make it hydro.

So I wrote:

Well, I ain't an expert, but I think it's pretty cheap.
You need different springs on the valves. 
You need different lifters (duh...).
I think the case needs to be remachined because the hydraulic lifters are 
slightly larger bore?
I think the cam is the same. Ditto the pushrods and rocker arms.
I've seen turnkey engines listed with conversion for like $110 extra- something 
like that? 
I bought all new hydraulic lifters for my '78 last rebuild and those parts set me
back about $100 I think.

Check my details, good mechanics out there?

Have at it,
