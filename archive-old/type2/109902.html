&lt;&lt;  Just tell me they didn't destroy another cool old car (like our buses).


Nope. It was left completely unscathed. And it is VERY prominent in the scene.

Doesn't play a prominent role, it's just there in the middle of everything.

In &quot;The War of the Roses&quot;, Kathleen Turner seems to drive the family
SUV over Michael Douglas' Morgan...The Morgan (owned by Robert Couch
at the time) was mounted on a hydraulic sled that lowered the Morgan
as the SUV went over it. That Morgan is alive and well and back on the
road...
