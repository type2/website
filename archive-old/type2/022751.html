Gail:  get the pop-top rubber seal kit from Bus Depot. I think it costs about $100, and installation will prob. take you a couple of hours.  let me know if you have any questions about installation - i did this on the ex's bus a few months back. good luck.

Just made a quick trip to Colorado Springs this weekend.  Now, need to find out about seals and weather stripping around the pop-top of a 78 Westy.  There was a terrible amount of air coming in around the whole top.  What does one do about this, and where do you find the seals. More about trip later.
Thanks, 
Gail Doles
78 Westy.
