Subject: hot wheel revisited
Date: Tue, 13 Feb 2001 09:09:20 -0500
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

I posted a week or so ago about a rear wheel heating up after driving a few
miles. I replaced the brake hoses and thought I'd fixed the problem. Then I
drove to a campground 80 miles away this weekend, and realized I hadn't
fixed the problem. The wheel was smoking hot (again) by the time I got
there. So I am going to have to go in and look at the bearings. This is a
very strange and confusing problem, as there has been no other sign at all
of bearing problems. I'll post the autopsy results.
Bob
