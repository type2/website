Subject: Re: [T2] the search for heat ends now  ..  Espar Airtronic D2

&lt;&lt;What are the dimensions of that Espar heater? It looks pretty small -
I wonder whether it could be mounted in the dead space behind the master
cylinder or the corresponding space on the passenger side.&gt;&gt;

There are so many other mounting  possiblites inside of the Bus why
would you randomly pick two of the smallest ?

I guess what I am asking--if the Espar heater was a little too big to
fit under the seat's--you wouldn't look for an alternate place to mount
it?
You then wouldn't even think of buying one then?

What a nice installation, good selection of one of the many mounting
possibilites, and that Espar unit will offer nothing but toasty
passenger's in the coldest weather.

They work super in Semi tractor bunks --it'll work great in that Bus
too.

No doubt in my mind.
