Subject: mice and patchwork camper

first of all, for all you mouse and cat lovers - the Foam Unit stats:

yes,   i got  *another*  mouse this morning.  She still loves me!  :)   This
one was large and dead.   This is four mornings in a row,  and she hadn't
brought one in before.

oh, yeah, the bus.    the left rear wheel came off really easy.  i was
amazed.  confused.  perturbed.  looked over my shoulder.  

the shoes were a bit moist, as the cylinder had leaked.  one of the clips
that holds the shoes to the backing plate was fallen apart.   i took the
whole mess off, put on new cyl,  cleaned up the shoes, greased up the stars,
 and put it back together with a clip on each shoe.

the right rear was a bit harder to get off, but not too bad.   nice and dry
in there, and the cylinder all rusted up.   redid that side too.  

the hand brake now actually does something.  i greased and WD-40ed it so it
would stop complaining.

no brake lights still.  hmmmm.   no power to sender.   lights do not come on
when i pull the wires and touch them together.  test light similarly does not
light up.  

 as it was really hot,  my inspiration was melting,    when i got a friend to
help bleed them,  the rears were not letting any fluid through. ( the fronts
were fine.  also,  the master cylinder leaks.   :&lt;   )  I guess that though
the rear hoses *looked* okay, they weren't.   i changed the right one,  and
the old one was clogged.  then i had other things to do, and had to split.
  my revised schedule has the camper ready to go by monday, when i can buy
tags and be legal.
