&gt; Hi, I recently just asked a similar question, but from a different point of
&gt; view. However, I did find out a few things that might help you. Some
&gt; companies (like State Farm) WILL offer FULL coverage on your Bus. However,
&gt; they need to send out an appraiser to your vehicle. You basically tell them
&gt; how much you want to insure your Bus for, and they'll base your premiums on
&gt; that. 

I've had full coverage on my buses from Maryland Casualty, Farmers, and
currently with Met Life  prices are competitive, but no full coverage is
cheap

&gt; Geico, and most others however will NOT insure the car for anything other
&gt; than what the Kelley Blue Book would value it at. And, well.. despite what
&gt; WE make think our cars are worth, the truth is that it is a 30 year old car,

&gt; money for one.. so our cars a devalued significantly. The only value our
&gt; cars have is to the collector car market, which the KBB doesn't seem to be
&gt; on par with.

but there is a  Kelly &quot;Green&quot; book which is for &quot;historic and
collector&quot; cars and both the split and the bay are in this book...quite a
difference in price listing even when comparing identical cars in both
books (which seems strange)  I didn't know this book existed until I was
arguing with an insurance company about the value of my bus after a minor
accident....a librarian suggested looking in the Green Book when I was
researching values at the local library...didn't know anything about it
but they had a copy on thier shelves,  as soon as I mentioned it to the
insurance adjuster they immediately changed thier tune, as though they
knew this book was there but hopeing no one else did.
