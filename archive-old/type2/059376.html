&gt; Another ? - according to the VIN, my bus is a Kombi, but everything

&gt; &quot;cabinet&quot;.  It also has louvered windows.  Is this a Kombi or did
&gt; someone in the past try to make it a &quot;pseudo- camper&quot;.

Having just aquired a 1969 Campmobile myself, I've been learning about
all this stuff too. 

&gt;From what I've been able to gather, VW Campers start out as Kombi's
(Type 237), then are sent over to Westfalia Werke and outfitted with
the camping equipment. I wasn't aware that they sold many non-poptop
campers in this country, but it apparently seems to be true. I'm
starting to notice quite a few.
