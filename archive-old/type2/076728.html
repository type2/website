Subject: Re: [T2] Sucked a valve?

Joe:
This really sounds like an electrical problem, when the engine just stops
dead.
Do you have spark?
Does this engine have FI?
I'd go through the trouble shooting stuff for the ignition and fuel
systems and then check the compression again before EVER taking  the
engine apart.

&gt; Before I bought it, tested the compression -
&gt; 112-115-119-115. Thought I had a strong motor.

&gt; &lt;snip&gt;

&gt; Then, pow....while driving on straight and level, blew the
&gt; muffler off (I dont think the clamps were tight) and it just
&gt; quit. When tried to re-start it, all it does is turn over
&gt; (no perceptible noise) and puffs moderate amounts of black
&gt; smoke. No start, no run. Towed it home.
