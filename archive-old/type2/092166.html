Subject: Re: [T2] type IV flywheel question

Steve, I believe the felt ring is there to stop the clutch disk dust
from getting into the grease in the pilot bearing. My engine didn't 
have one and I don't think I could find a replacement. I have a distant 
memory of reading some where that it was no longer needed or something
along the lines of that. Someone else might know more about that, 
but at least you know what it does now.

&gt;seems i'm missing something as i attach the flywheel onto a type4 - there's
&gt;a component in the bentley manual fig. 16-2, part #23 and it is called the
&gt;felt ring for pilot bearing. what does this do, and is it essential?  -
&gt;steve, wondering while the parts store is closed
