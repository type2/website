Subject: re: MG TD VW Based Replica in Bakersfield, CA area

Ran across a posting for a 1952 MG TD.  Turned out to be a VW based replica
without engine.  Started at $1,500, dropped immediately to $800, and voice in
the background was yelling &quot;$500! Tell them we'll take $500...&quot; Seems like at
least one person at the number is a motivated seller.  Couldn't get much in the
way of condition other than there was no engine.  I know nothing more about the
car or the people selling it. 

Apologies for the lack of Type 2 content, but thought there may be someone with
a spare engine in the Bakersfield area looking for a winter project.  Phone
number is (805)363-6842.  

Regards,  Bob Douglas
