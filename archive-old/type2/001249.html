Bob,
    Thanks! Thats exactly what it is!! I wasnt even thinking! I was looking
through My safare Manual awhile ago and it did mention the ebenspacher (sp)
Gas Heater. I do have a furnace under the sink. Unfortunatly NO HEATER in
enging comp. I think it goes on keft side upper of compartment. This might
be the last remaining artifact of this beautiful beautiful thing! I thought
it was some sort of glow plug But it didnt make sense it being in there.
Thnks for reminding me about what my bus has.( i feel like a geek) Now I can
sleep tonight. whew!
    Thanks again. One day I'll take all the listees out to dinner in
Chicago!!!.errrr or not..

searching for a cheap ebenspacher( fat chance) Steve
