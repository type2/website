Subject: Re: [T2] CHT Gauge wiring.... HELP!

Hi Todd,

I installed the VDO CHT gauge kit in my bus just before EveryBus this 
spring.

The supplied wire will only reach the dashboard if you follow the most 
direct route possible from the sender to the dash. In my case I used 
cable ties to attach the wire to the frame and I drilled a small hole 
just to the left of the heat riser pipe to feed the wire into the 
passenger compartment. I put the gauge in the clock pod and it only 
just fit.

 From what I've read on the list I'm led to understand that lengthening 
the wiring will make the gauge less accurate. I'd recommend you reroute 
the wire.

Happy trails,

&gt; Hey guys,
&gt;
&gt; 	I got my CHT gauge and sending unit. I installed both.... however, I
&gt; do not have enough line for them to meet! I routed the CHT wiring from 
&gt; the
&gt; left side of the bus all the way to the right side, and followed the
&gt; original wiring harness as it makes it's way down that long stretch of 
&gt; pipe
&gt; down the under-passenger side of the Bus. THEN, as it makes it's way 
&gt; around
&gt; to the front, I ran out of wire JUST as it enters the cabin. I'm about 
&gt; 3-4
&gt; feet short of wire. Does anyone know where I can get the wire I need 
&gt; for the
&gt; CHT gauge? From what I understand, I have to use special wire.. or is 
&gt; that
&gt; just on the sender? Can I just use any old wire?
