Subject: Re: Pop top canvas

If the fabric looks sound (not rotting or especially weak--if you can
poke your fingers though or easily tear the fabric, ya don'twanna try
this) get a large spray bottle and as you (or someone helping you) is
raising the top, dampen the fabric evenly all over untill you can
CAREFULLY get the top all the way up.  I would moisten further when
locked inplace and then let dry.  The top, now, with luck, should go up
and down easily.  you could also moisten the fabric with a dishtowel and
water if you like, just try to get it evenly wet.

I hope this helps,

&gt; After 3 months of waiting,  I finally have at the bus farm a very nice gold
&gt; colored '76 westy with 37K original miles on it!  This is one nice bus
&gt; except for a few &quot;dings&quot; that the elderly couple who bought it new put on
&gt; it.  The sliding door moves like a new one, the paint looks new, tranny
&gt; shifts as smooth as silk with no play and the body is solid, that's
&gt; pronounced &quot;no rust&quot;.  I have never had a bus so nice, my 19 month old
&gt; daughter and I are going to enjoy camping next summer.
&gt; 
&gt; My question is has to do with the very nice original top which is in great
&gt; shape, no tears.  But when I tried to put the top up this past weekend, it
&gt; was very tight from shrinking over the years and I didn't want to tear it.
&gt; Any way to put a little &quot;stretch&quot; in the old fabric?  It would be nice to
&gt; save the top.  Is there some sort of &quot;saddle soap&quot; or some other fabric
&gt; cream that can be put on the canvas to soften it up?  Thanks.
