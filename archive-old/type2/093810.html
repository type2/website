Subject: Re: [T2] doophed up friday question

I have pulled them off of other engines i recycled.  but  i think the 
spring and sleeve were probably put back on after changing engines.  
Most of the vehicles i parted out dated to the 60 to 65 time frame.  
only a couple still had their original 1200 engines. The tube through 
the shroud i believe was on all  that had the shroud left on them.

&gt;&gt; Dont know if it was the same on type two versions but on my type one 
&gt;&gt; engines there was a spring between the shroud and the carb. I believe 
&gt;&gt; there was another tube also.  I modified mine so the tube stayed in.  
&gt;&gt; flared the other end slightly and put a clip on it.
