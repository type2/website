Subject: My Canvas Install Experience

Good Morning Folks,
        Installed my new canvas this weekend-I'd rather do another front =
axle beam swap than tackle canvas again. I ordered it from Bus Depot, =
hoping to get gray, but Jerry told me orange &amp; tan are standard, but =
he'd try to get me the gray. About a week later, it arrived, in a box =
that appeared to be too small to have the  canvas in it, but that's what =
is was, folded neatly...and it was gray! Thanks Jerry! Since I removed =
my old canvas weeks ago, I was already ahead of the game. The directions =
say to find the center, front and back, top and bottom, on the roof of =
the bus and on the canvas, and mark it to line up the canvas. I did that =
on the bus, but the canvas was folded directly in the center, leaving a =
crease, so I didn't need to mark that, just used the crease mark. I have =
heard from some folks that the replacement canvas does not provide =
enough material to do the fold at the top over the plastic strips, but =
the directions indicted that there was. Well, at the front, I found that =
there wasn't. I had to staple the canvas (BTW, buy/borrow/rent an =
electric stapler) flush to the roof, and there was barely enough to =
reach the body, but once that metal bar that goes across the inside =
front of the roof is back in place, I don't think it will be that =
noticeable. My most exciting moment was when doing the front, and the =
support legs were disconnected from the roof and the roof was supported =
by a box (per the instructions). I hit the box with my elbow, knocking =
it out from under the roof, and I found myself supporting the roof with =
my head.Ouch! Now, the sides were a different story on the canvas =
length. There is just enough material to do the fold over the plastic =
strips. Some advice: pick a cool day to do this.To attach the sides at =
the bottom, you must lower the roof and support it on the box while you =
squeeze in between the roof and the upper bunk-it gets very hot up there =
on a sunny day.I used an ice pick to poke the holes through the lower =
bead at the bottom of the canvas to attach the metal strips and the =
canvas to the body. Once you're done, raise the roof s-l-o-w-l-y and =
watch/listen for any tearing on the canvas. Mine looks nice and tight =
when the roof is up, very smooth. Everything you've probably read before =
on this job is true, especially getting all those little screws back in =
on the bottom strips, and especially at the corners.  All in all, not a =
fun job, but I'm satisfied with the results.
