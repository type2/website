Subject: upgrading fuse box

  Has anybody rewired their bus with an EZ Wiring universal kit? I need to replace my fuse box and have developed a short in my wiring as well.  The EZ kit is $160.00 including a modern fuse box.  The kits are designed for hotrodders.  Just wondering if anybody has tried going this route and what difficulties may lay ahead.
