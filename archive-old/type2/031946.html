Subject: Arrgh!! Do I use the cylinder head shim, or not??
Message-ID: &lt;Pine.OSF.3.91.990505154604.27772C-100000_at_Sherlock.SIMS.Berkeley.EDU&gt;

Hey all,

Haven't made much progress in my two '81 Vanagon engine rebuilds as I've 
been mulling/stewing/freting over problems with my two sets of rebuilt 
heads.

Here's the general question: how critical is it to maintain the 
&quot;original&quot;, &quot;factory&quot; distance between the top of the head (the point 
where the rocker arm pedestals touch the top of the head) and the face of 
the crankcase?

To put this question in a more tangible form: do I use the head spacer 
with the rebuilt AMC (Spanish) heads, or not?

And here's the background and my understanding of the situation:

When I bought these AMC heads new, many years ago, the instructions that 
came with the heads said that the sealing ring or shim that goes between 
the head and cylinder should not be used.  I questioned the list about 
this (i.e., why the shim isn't necessary) and the response I got was 
&quot;because the shim is cast in place in the head.&quot;  Accordingly, NOT using 
the shim didn't mess up the head geometry established by the factory (and 
didn't mess up the compression ratios.)

Fast forward to today, when I get these heads rebuilt.  Knowing a little 
bit more today than I knew back when I bought these heads new (though, it 
seems, I still don't know enough) I decided to cc the heads and got 
less-than-perfect results; a &quot;small&quot; measurement of 52cc's and a &quot;large&quot; 
measurement (on the other head) of 57cc's.  Cranking these numbers 
through the spreadsheet I get a range of compression ratios of from 7.53 
to 7.15 using the head shims, and from 8.04 to 7.60 without the shim.  
The last range is clearly too high, so I've got to use the shims, it seems.

In talking to the shop that did the heads, they've advised that I can use 
&quot;non-standard&quot; barrel shims to bring the compression ratios closer from 
one side of the engine to the other, but there's been no talk about 
shimming the rocker arm pedestals or changing the length of the push rods 
to compensate.

To add to my confusion, I found the VW tech bulletin that advised using a 
1.6mm (.063&quot;) barrel shim and no head gasket in place of the original 
paper barrel gasket and head shim.  &quot;Ahhaa&quot; I shouted, the correct &quot;stack 
up&quot; is .063&quot;.  But, when I measure the barrel shim and head gasket that 
came with the gasket kits, I get a combined measurement closer to .04&quot;.

I guess I need to go back to the shop with these heads, corner the 
mechanic and have a long talk about all this........

But, am I running myself around in circles for nothing?  Does the fact 
that these engines have hydraulics somehow render all this worrying moot?
