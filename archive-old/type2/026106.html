Hello people of the list,

Some of you may remember my ongoing problem with carbs, running rich,
not idling properly etc.  Even after fitting new carbs last weekend
something was still not right and I could not get it adjusted properly.

Well last night I took the bus to meet one of my colleague's mechanic,
who worked for a VW dealership years ago, to see if he could shed any
light on the problem.  This guy is sharp!  He put the bus straight on
the lift, had a look underneath and voila ... there it was.  Every so
often, in time with the irregular thump I had been hearing from the #3
area, we could see that cylinder blowing.  It's hard to tell whether
it's coming from the exhaust manifold or between the head and the
barrel, I'm hoping the former so that I won't have to pull the engine
again (it was out last summer for painting the engine compartment).

Anyway, this leak was causing the CO output to read low, so setting the
mixture for a 'correct' reading was making the engine run rich (I knew
it had been rich but I thought it was just a carb problem).  We adjusted
the mixture for an apparent reading of 1.5%.  This should up my mileage
from the 10mpg area to something more sensible.
