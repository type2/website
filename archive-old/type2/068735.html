Subject: Re: Fire in the Engine Room 

regarding how to find out you have a fire and suggestions I've had
since my engine fire:

Smoke alarm in engine compartment (a friend gave me one for my birthday

String across engine compartment hooked to normally open switch in fuel pump 
circuit. Fire breaks string shutting off fuel pump.

And how I found out: Big cloud of black smoke in teh mirror;-)
