&gt; Hello Steve    While this is mostly true Vw did improve the later type 1

&gt; ever talk to Boston Bob Mcdonald(Bosto Engines) He is always looking for late FI
&gt; bug cases for building motors in Zambowias (SP)  the things that smooth ice
&gt; rinks , which are very hard on motors. Some of these use the VW diesel motor .
&gt; Balancing the rotating parts on a motor will only help it last longer . only
&gt; cost about $75.00 down here  

I was wondering if using the aftermarket aluminum case would make the
type 1 engine as tough as a type 4 engine.
