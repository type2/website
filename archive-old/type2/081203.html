Subject: Re: [T2] tail light probs

Hi Chris,

Darn, I jus love these electrical short questions. It takes all day working
on a bus to trace one using a multimeter, trial and error etc. ... but long
distance diagnosis is easy ...

The short under the dash may be related to the brakes. I would suggest
turning the headlights on and then jiggling the wires under the dash around
to see if the brake lights flicker. If they do try tracing the wire from the
headlight switch -- it should be black and white -- to the dimmer relay to
make certain it is clean.

Cheers,

&gt; Hi Class...have a problem i need some help out on.
&gt; when i turn my headlights on, my brake lights come on.
&gt; when my headlights are off my tail lights work fine. turn signals and
brake lights work fine. but when i turn my headlights on. the brake lights
come on and stay on. so i can't see my turn signals or my brake lights of
course.
&gt; any ideas? do i have a cross or short wire somewhere? duh.
&gt; i have another short, i believe, in my fuel/warning guages also. but as
long as i don't mess around with the wires under my dash that short doesn't
seem to be a problem at the moment. something that i will definately be
lookin into tho, when i get off of the road.
&gt; anyways..any help u can pass my way would be much appreciated. thanks in
advance, and a gr8ful peace out to all of u wonderful vwheads.

on guttin her and startin a makeover this coming fall.
