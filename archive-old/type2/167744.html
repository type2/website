Subject: Post Mortem: (was &quot;No Fire on #2 and #4?&quot;)

Just a quick follow-up to my problem where I wasn't getting full power 
from #2 or #4 on my 1600SP in my '67.

Looks like the problem was indeed a vacuum leak where the intake manifold 
meets with the cylinder head.  I pulled the manifold off, replaced the 
gaskets and everything seems to be A-OK now.

Thanks for all the tips!

Cheers,
    Tom

&gt; One thing I did was a &quot;Poor Man's Compression Test&quot;: pulling each spark plug 
&gt; wire out of the dizzy cap to see if the RPM changes, i.e. see if that 
&gt; cylinder is firing.  When I did this, there was no noticable change on cyls 
&gt; #2 and #4, making me think that they weren't firing properly.
