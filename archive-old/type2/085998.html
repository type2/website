Subject: Pistons -- flat top or dish top

Hi all,

I called today to get prices on pistons and the shop person asked me if I 
wanted flat-top or dish-top pistons.  I asked the difference, and she said 
that the dish-top pistons are better suited to bus engines due to their 
heavier weight, and the engine &quot;pings&quot; less when the engine is under stress 
(like a hill).  The drawback to the dish-top pistons is their lower 
compression, and the fact that the engine wears quicker b/c the compression 
starts lower on the dish-shaped pistons opposed to the flat-top pistons 
(using compression as an indicator of engine heath).  Does anybody have any 
info or opinions on this subject?
