Subject: Save the VWs!

        Jim, 
        It was me. And I guess I bow to your superior knowlege of shows and
scene. San Francisco Bay Area is still overrun with pre-68 VWs- heck
this is car-heaven, I see DeLorians, Triumph Stags, all kinds of wierd stuff
on the road daily.
        But it seems to me that you're red flag is like the Sierra Club-
warning of a potential disaster to the common good and asking for a
public consensus about it. I prefer, and support, the Nature Conservancy
approach. Sad fact, you can only rent public consensus. Buy the land,
buy the bus. I suppose you can even find a way to justify refusing
to resell to an overseas buyer. Me, I don't like the way that feels.
        The effects of scene police that keep the scene pure have
always seemed worse to me than any evil they seek to prevent. I agree
there's a problem as you describe, but I don't like the obvious
'solutions'- what are you suggesting besides awareness?

        Bill
