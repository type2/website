Subject: RE: [T2] Frame section

Greg,

Try Way out salvage. www.wayoutsalvage_dot_com
Also Bus Boys might be able to help you. www.bus-boys_dot_com

I'd cut you a section if I still had one of my many parts buses, but I'm
trying to cut down, heh.

Subject: [T2] Frame section

I have tried Busted? Bus and The Bus Co. for a frame section to replace my
mouse pee?rusted area where the brake prop. valve mounts.? 
Unfortunately they can't do me any good right now.
Does anyone know of someone else who parts buses that might be able to
supply a small section of frame rail?
OR, does anyone know if the frame section in that area is the same on all
Bays?? I think I can chop what I need from a '72, if it is the same (can't
really get close enough to look right now, it's 20 miles away, no wheels,
and full of bees)
Thanks, Greg
