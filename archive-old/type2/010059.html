Hey Now --
I've been doing a lot of perusing in the archives lately about mufflers --
selecting them, removing them, installing them, cursing at them, etc. --
because mine is toast and I'm getting ready to stick a new one in there.  I
have a stock crossover pipe -&gt; catalytic converter -&gt; muffler -&gt; tailpipe
arrangement.  During the course of my reading, I've seen several mentions
(in so many words) of &quot;watch out; you'd better do it right because if you
don't, carbon monoxide will leak into your heating system.&quot;  That's not an
attractive prospect for me, and not something I wish to worry about
(especially due to CO's undetectable qualities).  Now, I will only be
disconnecting my old rusty muffler from my existing cat and reconnecting
the new muffler (with used tailpipe) in its place.  Is there any risk of CO
leakage at this juncture of the exhaust system and if so, what can I do
about it?  Thanks in advance for any wisdom, everybody...
