I found it funny that there was a topic on the master brake cylinder warning
light.  on my way home from school today i had the pleasure of running a red
light when i realized i had lost my power brakes, and low and behold whenever
i pressed the brakes the (B) red warning light came on, i couldn't believe it
still functioned.  So since i still at least had non-power brakes i got home,
tightened the vacume hoses for the vacume assissted brakes (its a 72 Westy
with front disks, vacume power assisted) and cleaned the eletrical hook-up for
the vacume power assist unit, it was soaking wet with water, i went through
tons of puddles so i wiped it off, gave it some WD-40 and i now have my power
brakes back, i'm probably going to seal it with silicone when it gets dry out
to keep that from happening again, thank god no cars were coming the other
way.
