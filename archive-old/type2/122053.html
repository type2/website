Subject: Small Problem

Well, I had my bus in the shop the other day (Last Thursday) for a little tune-up work. While I had it there, I had them take a look at my brakes. Just curious to hear how much longer they are going to last me. While they were checking them out them tightened up my emergency cables, which now limits just how far I have to pull the e-brake unlike before where I had to pull it out completely in order to keep my bus in one stop. I drove it to work on Friday (no problems), even drove around after work for a quick happy hour and went home, finally resting the bus in my trusty garage. I didn't drive it Saturday or Sunday but when I went to leave this morning for work the drivers side rear wheel would not let me leave. My first thought was that I pulled the e-brake too hard it wouldn't let go. But I also realized that the passenger side was fine. I tired throwing it in reverse and backing out (with much gusto!) to no avail. It seems nothing will shake it loose.
 
Anyone ever run into this predicament before?
