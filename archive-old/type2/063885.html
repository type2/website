&gt;Is this a community?  It really sounds like one to me.

No.

(It is a mind-rending pagan CULT.) ;)

Market-making and profiteering are allowed, by the way--in exact 
proportion to one's value as an asset to the list. Such judgements may be 
safely left to the admin, whose integrity is unimpeachable and whose 
judgement is flawless. ;)
