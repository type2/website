Sapphire 17 AM (no FM)/8-track (mono) radio in my '71 bus??  Talk about

somehow I'm reminded of the Star Trek episode where the alien computer
starts to communicate with the Enterprise computer and starts to pull
information faster than the Enterprise computer could go, causing nasty
sparks to fly!

IMO the best sound for a bus comes from an AM broadcast, transmitted
through the dash-mounted speaker in Marvelous Mono.  Is Wolfman Jack still
on the air?
