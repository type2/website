Howdy,
I have an 82 Westy that just went through a 2.0 FI engine transplant
(factory rebuilt from Volkswagon of America). The engine is purring like a
charm. No problems (knock on wood).

However, when my mechanic was installing the engine he asked about the
clutch. I told him the PO had put in a new clutch and pressure plate
recently (within last 5 thousand miles). He said fine and put the new
engine in without replacing the clutch.

Well since I got the van back I've noticed a &quot;shudder&quot; or &quot;chatter&quot; when I
am accelerating from a stop in either first gear or reverse. This shudder
is very short lived it only lasts a few seconds as I'm letting out the
clutch and it only happens when the vehicle is hot. Meaning when I first
hop in in the morning there is no shudder. But after driving for a bit the
shudder crops up.

Interestingly enough my Father-in-law seems to be having the same problem
with his 85 Westy which also just had a rebuilt engine installed (I took a
ride in it and his shudder seems very similar to mine). He's been haggling
with his mechanic about it for months now and before I go to mine I thought
I would query the list to see if anyone had any thoughts on the matter.

Is it possible that the clutch was some how damaged during the engine
install and is simple slipping? I assume that the fact that it only happens
when the van has had a chance to warm up indicates that some sort of heat
related expansion is occurring somewhere. The question, of course, is where?

Any and all ideas would be appreciated,

Ian


PS-Possibly related? When I had the engine done I did have the shift
linkage pin and boot replaced. Since doing this it has been very difficult
to get the vehicle into first and reverse (If I drop into second before
shifting into first I have no problems). My mechanic has been attempting to
adjust this for me but hasn't found the sweet spot yet. I have no idea if
the shudder and shifting problem are related I just thought it best to
provide as much info as possible.
