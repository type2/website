&gt;Went to Midas the other day to have a complete replacement of my 
&gt;exhaust on the T*y*ta. Saw a bug up on the lift. Said to the guy, you 
&gt;replace Bug Mufflers? He said, veery slowly, yes, we do. I pondered 
&gt;this for a moment, and asked the inevitable question: do you guarantee 
&gt;them for life? He paused, looking unhappy, and answered slowly, yes. 

Beware!  Shops like this typically &quot;make&quot; a muffler for special applications
like VWs.  They take a cheap-o muffler that would go on a Japanese 4-banger,
cut the pipes off of it and WELD it to your heat exchangers, possibly using
pieces cut/welded from your old muffler as well.  I've seen it done and it
ain't pretty!  Beside hacking up things under your VW, they're also using a
muffler that is designed for an entirely different engine.  Wrong back
pressures, heat ranges, etc.
