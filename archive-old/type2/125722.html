&gt;So if anybody has ever gotten this seal from them and knows which side goes 
&gt;towards the body and would let me know I would appreciate it.

I've found the engine compartment lid seal to be the worst of any reproduction seal available:

You would have to glue it in place because it's obviously the incorrect shape but it would still be a poor fit with the door in my opinion. Since it has to keep out exhaust it's a shame.

At one point I was trying to get WCM to make a better fitting seal. Their rubber is good but their copy is the wrong shape. I'll have to plead with them again.
