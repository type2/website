Subject: Fuel Line cutoff alternative

Happy Friday all
In the year or so I have been on this list it seems that 
the subject of how to stop the gas from flowing when 
removing fuel lines has come up at least 3 or 4 times. I 
have been meaning to post this info for some time and 
today I finally got around to it. 
While perusing one of my motorcycle catalogs (Chapparral 
at http://www.800-841-2960_dot_com/) I saw these nifty Quick 
disconnect couplings that shut off fuel flow when you 
pull them apart. They are claimed to be compatible with 
all types of gas or racing fuel and come in 1/4(part#306-
1229 $13.99) and 5/16(part#306-1230 $14.99) sizes (kinda 
strange since most of the bikes that this catalog caters 
to are metric. They are made by Motion Pro and can 
likely be ordered through any motorcycle shop.
I haven't used one myself so no firsthand knowledge.
