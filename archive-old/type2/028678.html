Fellow and sister Bussers:

I am finishing up the final touches on my '71 Westy (no pop top) daily
driver -- the &quot;Lunch Box.&quot; She is looking real sweet (took a &quot;Best Bus&quot; at
the IVWA Summer Nationals last month -- sorry! I couldn't control my
immodesty) but I still have a few things to do. Herewith, a request for
information, and some information to share:

INFORMATION REQUEST: I have the standard curtain slider track over the
sliding door on the passenger side, but I seem to be missing some hardware.
The aluminum track is intact, a complete set of the plastic sliders is
there, but I can't figure out how one attaches a curtain to the sliders.
There are holes in the sliders: Are there metal wires, or clips,or something
else that you use to hang the curtain on the sliders? Any help greatly
appreciated!

OUTGOING INFO:

SAGGY BUTT seems to be a common malady for busses. Over the years there have
been occasional discussions on the list about saggy butt solutions, and in
the archives a number of old listers suggested coil-over shocks, air shocks,
or torsion bar adjustment (the last being a time consuming and potentially
dangerous task). The problem was that no one had much information about
where to get coil-over or air shocks.

Anyway, about three months ago I discovered that there ARE AIR SHOCKS that
will fit VW vans. After much searching, frustration, and a little creative
research, I found out that air shocks for '85+ Chevy Astro Vans will fit the
VW van (cost: about $80 beans). This is a good quick cure for the saggy-butt
problem, and I have had good results in my bus so far. But a warning is in
order: The shock towers on the VW are not designed as heavy load-carrying
devices. If you have moderate sagging problems, air shocks can help; or if
you are carrying heavy loads for short distances, they can help prevent
excessive bottoming-out. But if you have serious sag, a torsion bar
adjustment is your best bet. I don't know this for sure, but I will also bet
that if someone makes coil-overs for the Chevy Astro, they'd fit the VW too.

I also have some experience/ideas on WOOD PANELING REPLACEMENT, HEATER
IMPROVEMENTS, and PAINT ON THE CHEAP. I'd be happy to provide more
information on this stuff (part numbers, procedures, pictures, etc.)to
interested persons; contact me at:
sleonard_at_intrex_dot_net
If there is sufficient interest, I'd be happy to post info directly to the
list.

Regards, Steve Leonard
