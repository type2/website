Subject: Tail Gates
To: type2_at_type2_dot_com

The tail gate on my '71 Westy is pretty badly rusted on the inside and it 
also has a big dent under the window.  I want to replace it with a used one 
from the local Pick-N-Pull, but I'm not sure what years are compatible with 
my '71.  My &quot;seat of the pants&quot; feeling is that '68 thru '79 are 
interchangeable.  Can anyone confirm that?
