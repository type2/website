Subject: MicroMachines Available (limited)

The local Toys-R-Us has the #10 series
        ^^^^^^
These include (on a blistered card:)
White Rabbit looking cabrio w/ground effects
Orange  60's something Ghia sedan
Red and Monkey-puke yellow 23 window Bus (the best of the lot)
Green and Monkey puke 67(?) Beetle 
Lime green `vert beetle

They all have what appear to be cut-out fenders, Mag rims w/fat tires
Sorta achieves that 4x4 look so desireable with the rug-rats.
The display card features planes,trains and various automobiles in
livid 4-color process....

the manufacturer is &quot;Galoab&quot;
the line number is 75030, #10 Volkswagens/Micro-Machines

I don't remember what we paid for them (less than 10.00US) but saw
them at the VolksFolks show selling for 25.00 (???)

What I can and will do is the next time the SO and I go to play at toys-R-us
we'll see how many units are still available. I'll post then to the
collective list and 
we'll figure a way to get `em to youse....
