Subject: Re: auxiliary battery

&gt; Do some good shopping around because I have drained my
&gt; auxillary battery 'alot' not once or twice but many times.

Yep - me too. Most weekend trips drain it. Nice to hear about the
&quot;Battery Minder&quot; - i'll check that out. Incidentally, I've also used my
deep-cycle as a jump-starter on a couple of occasions. Not what it's
designed for, I know, but it got me home :-)
