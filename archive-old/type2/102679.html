Subject: Wow! Spare tire carriers, ladders, racks, etc.

Volks,

While briefly searching for a spare-tire bike rack for my 78
Westy,
I found the below site.

It's geared for Vanagons, but I'm compelled to ask the gentleman
that
makes them if they might be modified for Bays.  I'm also
compelled
to really really really hope the money tree grows again so that I
might
buy some of this incredible stuff!

Any of you T3ers have one of these products?
