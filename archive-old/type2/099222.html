Subject: Qu re using 77-78 FI stuff in a 75 FI engine

Given a 75 engine that's out for top end rebuild, there is a discussion
beteen me and Jon as to whether we can replace the 75 airbox/throttle
which has  the funky throttle switch (he said they get dirty &amp; that's
why they were removed by late 76?) with one off a parts engine I have
that has a later harness, 7 pin AFM, and I guess I'd need a later (77 or
78) ECU?  The parts engine has 2 injector connectors cut off, and we
don't know which harness ends go to which cylinders- does this really
matter?  I recall reading that all the injectors get pulsed at the same
time (taken off the wire to the condensor), injecting 1/2 of the final
needed gas each pulse?
Is that true?  
    If I do use the later FI, I realize the volume of the 75 engine
(1800) is not like the 2000 - but Jon says since it's air flow
controlled, it should not matter that the later ECU is used when matched
to the AFM???
