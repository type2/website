&gt; &gt; Although some don't like them, I would also
&gt; &gt; recommend getting a VW catalog
&gt; &gt; from www.jcwhitney_dot_com. They tend to have some
&gt; &gt; pretty good prices and
&gt; &gt; selection and pictures for just about everything.
&gt; &gt; They also seem to be
&gt; &gt; carrying some better brands now, like bugpack.
&gt; 
&gt; Check JC Whitney's shipping charges. I quit using
&gt; them
&gt; because they are too high! Some listmembers have
&gt; been
&gt; having bad luck with Bugpack.

Personally, I've had *nothing* but bad luck with
Bugpack... I wouldn't recommend their crap to an
enemy! I keep hoping they will just go away, but they
seem to find enough suckers to stay afloat.

Ya gets what ya pays for.... and Bugpack is *no*
bargain at any price.

IMHO.
