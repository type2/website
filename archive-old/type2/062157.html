Subject: Photovoltaic Power on a Bus

The latest issue of Home Power Magazine (#54 - August/September '96) has 
an article on a gentleman who has put five 75 watt PV panels on the roof 
of his '69 Kombi. It's an interesting article. 

Initial thoughts: Very robust well thought out electrical system, which 
is totally separate from the Bus' own electricals.

Expensive as all get out. &gt;$4K for 2,000 watt hours per day, but he can 
run for 3 days on his batteries and he doesn't have to run his engine to 
recharge his batteries.

Had to retrofit with a '71? front end discs to compensate for loss in 
braking power when he added 400 lbs of traveling weight to his bus.
