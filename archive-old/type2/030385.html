Volk,

We are moving again. (I hear you groaning from here :)  As you all know,
we were down from Friday afternoon until this (Sunday) afternoon.  The
reason is that our host (Atlasta_dot_net) has sold their Georgia operations 
to duesouth_dot_net.  As a result, the list is moving to the Seattle office of
Atlasta_dot_net.  On the one hand, this move *should* consist of two seamless
switches, one from our current box to a temporary box while the permanent
box gets shipped to Seattle and then another seamless move from our
temporary box to our permanent box in Seattle.  The problem is twofold.
First, very few moves of this nature are seamless; second, I will be out
of town and entirely offline from Wednesday thru Sunday.  David Raistrick
is managing the move (and I profer my homage and great thanks to him for
his work in keeping the lists going). and will keep the status file up to
date as much as possible.

For anyone who does not know, the current status of the list can be found
at:

Also, while I am away, George Lyle will be taking over the admin
functions.
