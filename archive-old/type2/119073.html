Subject: Re: [T2] Steering coupler

Oooh, ouch, no it was not anywhere near that bad. That's scary. Mine does
have some visible cracks though. I had already bought one from Ron at BD for
$18.95. Same part# but I dont know if its the mexican version or not. Hope
not. From that photo it looks like maybe it will be easier to get to from
the top. Did you replace yours durring the resto?

Thanks for the info!

&gt; Someone sent me this photo a while back and I saved it. Was it this bad?
;-)

&gt; The bolts are M8 35mm long. There are washers on each side of the coupler.
&gt;
&gt; I haven't surveyed all the vendors but the Bus Boys coupler is the el
cheapo
&gt; Mexican one for $15. OEVeedub has the real deal from Germany for $20 (we
at
&gt; least know it lasts 25+ years).
