Subject: Help with steering wheel removal

Ok folks...here's the problem.

I've got no less than three westys...one, a 73 camper is being parted out,
one, a 72 is being refitted, and the final a 74 is a daily driver..

however, the previous owner had jerry rigged or rather duct taped a starter
switch to the 74s steering column. I have keys to both the 73 and 72 and
took a look at Haynes manual, dealer manual, and even a couple of photo
sites form this list on steering wheel removal to just switch the switches,
etc...

well, guess what...I did all the stuff it says to do and then began using a
puller on the steering wheel and I can't get one off the 72 or 73

the puller actually breaks part of the plastic from the wheel...so I am not
starting on the 74 until I find a better way..

I do not have a puller like the one in the vw manual, but it would seem that
if this thing is going to come off it would be easier than this...

Any got a clue as to steering wheel removal..these are all locking wheels,
but the manual makes no mention of anything special...
