Subject: Re: [T2] Plumbing &amp; Fuel Pump for a late BN4 Gas Heater

I intially had trouble getting the heater to work correctly
on the bench, but then I got a hold of a fellow named robert
and his email address is warmerwagen_at_hotmail_dot_com. He messes
around with heaters here and there and we spent a couple hours
one evening on the phone and figured everything out. From
that point I was able to leave the heater running on the bench
for extended periods of time just like it should. It would
reach a given temp then the fuel pump would shut off while
the fan continued to run until it would cool slightly and then
she would fire back up. Now in the vehicle it does that a 
couple times and then just shuts off. Then if I turn the 
switch on or off it won't start again. I let it sit for a 
couple hours and then it starts right up again. I think I
will try running it with just the purolator fuel pump and see
what happens. It is just a pain messing with all those fuel
lines and everything.  I just really want some heat in the bus cause I have a 8am class on M,T,Th this semester and don't want to freeze every morning! I know, I'm in TX but
it doesn't mean I like being cold (or cool I suppose for
some of you northeners)! :)
