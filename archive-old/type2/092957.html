Subject: Re: [T2] Installing window glass

You'd be surprised of how hard it is to break this glass. i dropped one of 
the rear side windows on CONCRETE and it survived just fine.

The way you break glass is to pry on it with a screwdriver or hit on it 
near a corner.

Go for it. If you want to visit me here in TN we can install it for you in 
my driveway...

Another option would be to see if one of the local glass shops or auto body 
shops or glass installers would let you watch...

I did my first window install with an old mechanic at an car restoration 
shop and it was SO easy. Of course then there was the '57 Beetle that got 6 
new windshields b/c they kept breaking them (body was tweaked).


&gt;i have been wanting to do this...do you know of a video of it being done?? 
&gt;or at least some pics??
&gt;
&gt;i am afraid of showering myself in glass
