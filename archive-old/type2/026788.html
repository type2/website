Brett,
   You said....&quot;I am looking for a bit of advise for the removal of a 
starter on my 77 bus.
I only have one bolt left to remove, it is the top bolt and I cant seem to
locate it. Chilton's states &quot; have a helper hold the nut on the top bolt
with a wrench in the engine compartment while you remove the bolt from
underneath the vehicle.&quot; I cant seem to find the nut in the engine
compartment, and the bolt that I feel on the starter feels round....

   I drove a 77 for almost 20 years and had the starter out often.  The top 
bolt of the starter is the upper right side engine mounting bolt.  The 
forward end of the bolt has a funny shape to it to keep it from turning, not 
round, but kinda like 1/2 moon shaped.  Open the top hatch above the engine 
and loosen and remove the nut from the upper right engine to transaxle bolt. 
  Then push the bolt out towards the front of the bus.
   Of course installation is just the reverse.
If that's not clear, P-mail me off list and I'll try again.
