Hey there Karl, (and listee's)

I don't write the ads, I just post 'em. Seriously, I think what the
seller &quot;wanted&quot; to say was that the engine/tranny were rebuilt in
'91.

Or, maybe, they have installed a '91 subaru engine in it (which would
also account for the $7k price tag ). [I wonder how Mr. Hoover is
doing with his subaru swap]

I kind of lump these kinds of ads into the &quot;owner doesn't really know
what they're talking about&quot; category. You know... the 59 &quot;barndoor&quot;
bus for $cheap ads, (3/55 was the cutoff for barndoors - see recent
related vintagebus thread), the 1978 &quot;Vanagon&quot; ads, and the 5 speed
(4 foward, 1 reverse) aircooled vw ads (ok, Mike G's ride doesn't
count He HAS a 6 speed).

The other thing that always bothered me were the ads for VW bug, 2
door, etc. When did you ever see a bug that didn't have 2 doors. (ok,
uncle jess's empi limo doesn't count).

Ok, I'll stop complaining now ....
