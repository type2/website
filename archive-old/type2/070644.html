Subject:  68 to 73 Westy Luggage rack questions


The PO of the 72 once removed the luggage rack to clean it. When it 
was reinstalled it was done crookedly. The PO told me it was a real 
bear to get the rack back on. I was thinking about pulling it off and 
trying to readjust it. Any thoughts?

Has anyone found stainless steel replacement for the luggage tie 
downs on the surrond the luggage rack? I have a really cool vinyl 
cover that appears to be made from the same material as the side tent 
floor. The cover has leather straps that slip into the tie downs. I 
would like to use this but I do not trust the rusty nasty tie downs. 
Any thoughts?

Chris
