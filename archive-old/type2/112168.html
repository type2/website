Subject: 67 Flywheel confusion HELP ME!!

I am trying to put a 71 engine (1600 DP) into a 67
bus.  Since both 71 and 67 were 12 volt systems, I
assumed it would just be a straight bolt on situation,
but NOT!!  First off, I find that the flywheel is too
big for the bell housing on the 67 tranny. WTF?!?! 
OK, maybe for some reason the 67 bus (confirmed by the
VIN that it is a 67) has an older tranny in it. So
grind away the bell housing to make the flywheel fit.
Engine goes in and will turn by hand, good sign. But
when I electrify the starter (which is a 12 Volt
starter) I get a click and then nothing. The starter
is hanging up on the flywheel. Again, WTF?? 
So, does a 67 bus have a 12 volt flywheel as in a 71
or does 67 use a bastard flywheel of somekind??, and
what about the starter is there a special bushing for
the starter. Just what do I have to do to make a 71
engine go into a 67 bus???
