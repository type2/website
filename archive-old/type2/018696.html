Wow!  my eyes opened wide in disgust at how much rust there was on my
shifting plate and spring when I finally got the vice grips out and
popped that thing up...

There was no spring.  It had become one (by means of total and complete
rustation) with the shifter base.  The PO must have gotten mad at it
some time or another too because my gearshift lever was bent/twisted....

I think this has been the cause for my shifting slippage...

does anyone have a good shifter base/ stop plate/ lever/ spring that
they would sell??

It has to be free of major rust...
I know the kit is cheap...but better to use stuff off of another bus
than to buy brand new...its good for the karma!

either way...I must get one soon.

Thanks!
