Subject: Re: [T2] T4 push rod ID

&gt;I am disassembling a 2l T4 engine w/hydraulic lifters. One of the push rods
&gt;was chewed up (badly!) on the cam end.  I ordered a new one from Bus Depot
&gt;(071 109 301) but it doesn't look like the others.  The ones in the engine
&gt;have tapered ends while the new one has &quot;bulb&quot; ends.  I have no history on
&gt;this engine so I really don't know its condition, I'm just trying to get it
&gt;to run.  Could this engine have incorrect push rods or will the odd push rod
&gt;work OK with the others?

Alan,
I'm using 2 of these 'new' push rods sold by Bus Depot, Have
approximately 8k 
miles on them no problems.  They do look different in comparison to the
stock 
as you mentioned, they looked fabricated by a metal specialist??. 
Besides 
the looks they seem to work just as well.  I do recall taking
measurements and 
comparing it to the stock push rod.  I',m using them so they must have
been 
passed my approval :-)  They should work just fine with your type 4
engine
equipped with hydraulic lifters.
