&gt;I'm fairly befuddled about which is the best way to go on the other
&gt;parts. With options like German or Brazillian rings and various choices
&gt;on main and rod bearing sources,

Fortunately, bearing manufacturers have some integrity, unlike many of their distributors.
Hard to go wrong there. I like new ones.
As for rings, well, there's a lot of controversy . cheap rings are cast iron, they seat well
and wear rather quickly. They reseat old barrels nicely, and don't last very long.
Hard rings might not seat in used barrels. you could smoke from the start.

&gt;Has any body out there on the type2 compiled a preference of Name Brands
&gt;for rebuild items?

Yes. Volkswagen.

&gt;I hear complaints about gasket sets, cylinder heads and engine
&gt;rebuilders. I tend to lean towards the German parts but after all they're
&gt;all just aftermarket parts. Aren't they?
&gt;
&gt;I don't want to get stuck in the rut of just buying the cheapest to get
&gt;by. I've got a Beck Arnold parts distributor here in Dallas but quite
&gt;frankly we have a case of sour grapes, they're liars. I've made several
&gt;trips to pick up parts that they said were in stock and then when i got
&gt;there they wanted a deposit to order it.

Sometimes, you can mail-order and get the same deal.

&gt;RE: Solution to the cylinder head setup = cc the cylinder on TDC with 5
&gt;wt oil to the first lowest spark plug thread. With the engine on the
&gt;table this counds like the most accurate.

Kids, Don't try this at home. There is a more accurate procedure outlined in your book.
 ( And there will be a quiz tomorrow 8^)
