Subject: Tire Price and Warranty

I like the Idea of Buying products and having the labor done at the same  
place. That way if I have a problem with the product (tires ), I can go to that  
place and get the problem fixed without getting the run around. And if 
possible  I like to purchase from a well established dealer because if I do not get  
satisfactory service, I can complain to their bosses, and they have a 
reputation  to protect. And if they are state wide or nation wide I can get service 
out of  town, under my warranty.
