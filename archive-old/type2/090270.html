Subject: Re: [T2] what i love/hate about bus ownership

Man, around here when I drive the 16 year olds are too
intimidated to wave at me. They always think just
because I'm young and driving a bus that I'm a sex
feind. Their parents never trust me. I hope I get it
put back together soon. God, I'm drunk...

&gt; we call them hippies around my parts...and yes I do
