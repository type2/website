Subject: Seattle: core 1600DP engine available

Anyone in the Seattle area need a used T1 engine to rebuild?  I've
removed a 1600 dual-port engine with single-relief case from my bus.
When I removed the old engine, it was running well enough to drive
normally, but it has has zero compression on cylinder #3 (#1 and #2 at
120, #4 at 125), lots of end play, and low oil pressure at idle.  I had
thought about trying to rebuild it myself, but decided against and
bought a new Mexican engine instead.  The engine is located in
Ballard/Loyal Heights, near Golden Gardens.

My skill level is that of a novice who can read directions, so I might
be somewhat over my head in installing an engine on my own.  Ideally, I
would be thrilled to trade the core engine for experienced help this
weekend or next in getting the new engine dressed up, installed,
timed/tuned, and running like a dream.  Anyone interested?

Thanks,

- Miles (206-251-3791)
