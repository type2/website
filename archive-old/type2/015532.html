Not necessary if it is machined and assembled properly in the first place,
but some might consider it an enhancement of procedure. It is not called
for by Bentley. But if the warrenty provisions from your builder says to do
it, then you must do it to maintain the warrenty. If it is not in the
warrenty requirements, then doing it might be used as an excuse for breach
of warrenty. If you don't retourque them properly you danged well can skew
things out. 

The supplier of the long block has no direct control over many things that
can foul up his work. DIY installer could drop the motor on it's head with
a piddlin' jack support. Shippers can bang things up. Someone says, &quot;My Dad
used to use (any brand of snake oyl) to breakin all his flathead V-8's!!
Swore by it.&quot; Ok, sounds good to me. These things can all be the foundation
of failure just before or just after the warrenty runs out. If these things
worked, the warrenty provision would REQUIRE their use, not ban their use
by abscents of their mention.

More important is the initial torquing procedure, following proper pattern,
and at least three stages, side to side, to bring the stresses up evenly on
the case. You can warp the case with poor procedure here. Most important of
all is the machining tolerances. The bases for the cyliners in the case
must be dead on plane with reference to the axis of the crankshaft and 90°
to the axis of the cylinders and the mating surfaces in the heads must be
in plane and parralled to the cylinder bases surfaces, and the cylinders
themselves must be the same length to a thou or less. If you allow a thou
for the crankshaft error, a thou for cylinder lenght error and a thou for
the head cutting you can be at the limits of spec. A half thou tolerance
all around is more better.

Retorquing the heads after running in will have no meaning if these
tolerances are out, and for that matter, the initial torquing will have no
meaning as well. A stock tolerance VW air cooled engine is very different
beast when compared to a bored block configuration. That's why so many of
the GEX etal engines fail. They are assembled out of spec because the time
and skill and care to confim spec is abscent. That's non-stock/spec
parts/procedure = failure.

One enhancement I did on my Porsche boxer 912. I used valve grinding paste
to do a final mating of the upper cylinder to head mating surfaces. Gave
them a beautiful flat matt perfectly matched sealing surface. Go easy with
this. Just enough for surface conditioning. You don't want to cut anything
at all even measurable by a half thou tolerance micrometer, a few ten
thousants only. And final cleaning of the grinding paste must be thourough.
A single particle of that grit can scour your new cylinder or scratch a
stress riser into a new ring so it cracks the first time you load it during
breakin procedure. Make sure those mating surfaces are bone dry and
surgically clean for final assembly. This will insure best head seal far
better than any retourquing procedure.

What DM requires most of all is abscence of assumptions, everything must be
empirically verified by redundant measures the eye cannot see. Rote skill
with calibrated micrometers and error analysis is not optional. It is not
that there is no error in the work, it's a situation where you confirm by
accurate skilled measure the maximum probabaly error inherent in the
procedures, and that max error is within the standard or enhanced specified
tolerance. Confidence=confirmation of facts. 

I won't warrent my time to remove a failed motor if it was not supplied by
a machinist I know and can personally talk to and verify his resume and
reputation for results. If I can do this, then there will be no failure due
to either his or my workmanship and he and I will gladly guarantee against
any parts/labor to fix any failure at no cost for the specified period
because the probability of a failure is remote to the max if the warrenty
provisions are followed in fact and reasonably documented. Not keeping
receipts showing purchase of specified lubricant and filters for the
specific provisions of the warrenty is to be imprudent at best. Not
documenting conformance to warrenty provisions in most cases voids
warrenty. If you have 7 invoices for lube and filter all dated with milage
written on them and invoices or notes for reasonable maintenance and
adjustments you won't have to rely on &quot;Yeah, I did all that.&quot; and neither
will the builder/installer. You can then say, &quot;Yeah, I have all the
receipts and records to show compliance with warrenty provisions!!&quot;  That's
reasonable evidence.
