Subject: Shinybus / Faded Paint

	I'm woefully tardy with reports of taking delivery of my '70
seven-passenger and pulling the engine &amp; repairing the stripped spark plug
holes &amp; installing thermostat &amp;c.  But...

	...I've been trying to make the two-decade-old Earl Scheib (sp?) 
paint job look a bit nicer.  Here's a comparative picture!

Note the markedly greater shiny-ness of the middle panel. :)  I tried both
Turtle Wax Color Back and POR-15 Wax Prep.  I find that the POR-15 product
gives a nicer result on my paint; YMMV.  I followed this with POR-15
Carnauba wax. (You say carnooobah, I say carnowwwbah...  How *do* you
pronounce it, anyway?)

	That small panel cost me the better part of one hour's elbow
grease.  Well, at least it's not a panel van!!!
