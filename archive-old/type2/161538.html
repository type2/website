Subject: City/Battery aux. battery panel

Hey all,

Does anyone know of a source for the switches on the fridge control panel,
battery charger panel or whatever it's actually called? The power switch on
mine a pretty much frozen. I can use the fridge but the power on/off switch is
really stuck. So rather than risk breaking it I just leave it on city power so
it doesn't drain the auxiliary battery. Not a big deal yet but I'd like to
replace the switches or the whole panel ideally since the charger doesn't
work, but have had no luck so far on The Samba or the Bus Co.

Any suggestions?

Thanks, Doug
