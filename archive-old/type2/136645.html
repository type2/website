Subject: Bus Depot Thermostat

Hey folks, I just purchased 2 thermostats from Bus
Depot which their website purports to be the only
available replacement for the type IV engine.  The
part number is 111119159AGR.  Their website says to
remove the endcap to feed the wire through it but it
comes with no endcap that I can see.

I just called Bus Depot and the gentleman with whom I
spoke on the phone indicated that no one there knew
how to make this thermostat fit.

It's kind of hard to describe since it looks nothing
like the original.  It has a big stiff spring wrapped
around it, An 8mm stud, nut and lockwasher on one end
(I'm assuming to mount to the bracket) and a very
small female threaded opening on the other end.  Does
anyone know how to make this thing fit the type IV
engine?  tx, Greg
