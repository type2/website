Subject: Re: [T2] Turn Signal Switch 72 Bus

Years back, the high beam switch portion of the turn signal switchon my 72  was malfunctioning. At a junkyard i grabbed one from a later bus (I don't know what year). AIRC A couple of the wires were different colors than the wires coming out of the old switch, but i plugged it in and it worked until I parted that bus out. I think I guessed at hooking up the mismatched ones and got it right the first time.

-------------- Original message ----------------------
From: John Ingram &lt;johnvi_at_cloud9_dot_net&gt;
List-
The turn signal switch on my 72 bus has failed.  Bus Depot tells me  
that the switch is backordered and has been for a long time.  The 72  
bus has a switch that is 72 only.
