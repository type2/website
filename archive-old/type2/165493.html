Subject: Squeal/whistle in engine

I had to rebuild my engine (1973, 1700, single weber carb) last fall because 
one of the main bearings ceased, and now there is a fairly loud 
squeal/whistle when the engine is running. It seems to be coming from the 
left side of the engine.

When I first fired up the engine and noticed the squeal (on the right side), I 
tightening the intake manifold nuts a bit more and that eliminated the squeal 
so I thought it was just intake leak, which made sense because my intake 
manifold studs were in really bad shape.

Well, I finally got all the intake manifold studs replaced/fixed and got the 
nuts torqued down correctly but the squeal seems to be getting worse and now 
it's on the left side. Any ideas? My next thought was to take off the carb 
and intake manifolds and check the gaskets for proper seal...
