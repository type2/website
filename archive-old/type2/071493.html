&lt; Remove the 2 10mm nuts holding down the 3 + 4 injectors. Lift them up and 
 out of the intake. Leave all the hoses attached! Have someone crank the 
 engine. While it's cranking put your hand under each nozzle. Is it getting 
 soaked with fuel? The nozzles should be spraying. If not, let me know.
  &gt;


I have already done this and found no fuel. that is what made me decide to go 
get a fuel pressure gauge to make sure that there is sufficent pressure. 
There was. I'm on my way to check if a donor ECU or cylinder head temp sensor 
will do anything. The only other thing that i figure may work is new 
injectors, but i dont suppose that all of them would be bad at the same time, 
unless of course something got in and clogged them, but i had changed my 
filter about 1500 miles ago. That reminds me that i used to use some injector 
cleaner additive till about a month ago. It was a bottle that you added an 
ounce to each tankful. It claimed to keep the seats of the injectors clean. 
It seems to have been discontinued, as i cant find it anywhere all of a 
sudden.
     i'll keep up and post my results of the days endeavors this afternoon.
   I hope the guy at the shop doesnt take too much offense to me workin on my 
van in his lot. I guess he doesnt have much of a choice since he has pushed 
it off for the last three days telling me all the time that &quot;I'll look at it 
in about two or three hours, come back then,&quot; and never actually doing 
anything  ;o)

thanks all...
