Subject: using fiberglass to repair air cleaner

I have a 75 bus with an 1800. It has a hole in the air cleaner housing
that the P.O. had covered with tape. I would like to repair the hole
with fiberglass but I am concerned that it may not stick to the plastic
that the air cleaner is made of.
Has anyone done this kind of repair before? Is fiberglass a good choice
or is there something better.
Thanks,
Tom
