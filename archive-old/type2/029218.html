Subject: Jetz Update

Well I dug out the Bentley last night and answered my first question, the
34 PICT 3 has a 125 main jet.

I am still stuck on what size and where to get bigger jets.  No one carries
them locally, Bus Depot doesn't either.  Does anyone know what a fair price
is?  Any tricks to install them without pulling the carb?

Would appreciate any help or suggestions.

Thanks again.
