Maybe my assembly was missing a few screws or something but I've taken the
fan housing off my upright with the engine still in the bus.  And it was
easier than pulling the engine (I'm tired of pulling my engine).  As a rule
I'd go out and try it.

Christopher
&gt;Can you remove the fan housing without pulling the engine? I've been told
    &gt;you couldn't... Maybe that's just the upright engine.
    &quot;No&quot; on the upright, and &quot;nearly no&quot; on the pancake...
