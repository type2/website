&gt; Yes, the key is time.  A friend who restores old farm tractors has a large vat
&gt; with maybe 10-15 gallons of Diesel fuel in it.  He removes oil pan, valve
&gt; cover, plugs, etc.... then soaks the block with crank, pistons, head for a good
&gt; long while.  He lifts the engine, allows it to drain, then blows it out, then
&gt; tries to turn it a bit..... and repeats the soaking.  His method has the
&gt; advantage of cleaning out oil passages. YMMV.  But basically the important
&gt; thing is not to rush it.  The engine took months/years to get stuck.  Take it
&gt; easy.  Glenn

many many years ago, a friend and I found an old MG-TC under a tarp behind
some old guys house, he practically gave it to us, but it had been under
that tarp for years,  we finally took the long block and put it in a 55
gal drum and filled the drum with used motor oil and diesel fuel.._dot_capped
it and left it all winter in a corner of the garage while we worked on
other things...finally after several months in the &quot;can&quot; we pulled it out
and got it to turn over freely, and when put together it ran quite
decently...I went into the service then and never saw the car again since
friend totalled it about a year later....oh well!
