it's not the diameter but the width,  I ran 205/70x14 tires for years and
they under certain situations would rub the wheelwells. not bad but they
were very close and I doubt 215s would clear enough

&gt; 215 is 3cm wider tha the OEM size (185mm)
&gt; /70 is a smaller aspect ratio compared to /82 (the OEM size)

&gt; So the &quot;big&quot; tire is actually smaller in circumference.
&gt; What is the load rating on this tire ? (this is the deal braker)

again not the diameter but the width.

and as you say the load rating is the kicker
