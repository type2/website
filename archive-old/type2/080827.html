Subject: Turn signal switch help needed

Hi Folks,
    I need help from some of you who have already been down the road I'm now
on.  While I have my steering column apart to replace the ignition switch, I
decided to replace the turn signal switch too.  I ordered up a 211 953 513G
from the Bus Depot as their website listed for our '71 but received a 211
953 513J when the order came.  I just got off the phone with customer
service there and was told that the G is no longer available and that they
were selling the J as a replacement.  They informed me that quite a few had
been sold this way.
    Now for my question.  Since the original switch (the G) has 8 wires and
this replacement (the J) only has 5 what changes do I make in the wiring?
Have any of you made this change and kept track of the changes?  I sure hope
so because I'm not much in the mood to be charting unexplored territory
right now.  Thanks in advance for any help you might be able to offer.
