When I did my valve adjustment, I used the distributor AND that whaddaya
call it -- timing gauge around the pulley to reference my cylinders. Per
the book. And measured clearances before, during, and after. And kept
track of slot position when I tightened lock nuts. And re-measured
clearances. Tracked plug wires from distributor cap to plugs to confirm
rotor position.

As far as cleaning the threads and installing the inserts -- I dunno. I
didn't realize that metal particles falling into the cylinders would be
an issue, but now that you mention it -- of course. I doubt seriously
they pulled the heads.

I'm rather disillusioned with my mechanics right now. They have an
excellent reputation locally and they've always been nice to me. BUT
today, on my way to get my comprehensive estimate for the deer damage,
the oil light came on and stayed on. I pulled over ASAP, swore a great
deal, called AAA, and got towed back to my mechanics'.

My engine wasn't hot, it had oil, and it didn't sound bad, but I wasn't
taking any chances. If they broke it, they're fixing it. They checked
connections, jiggled wires, oil light went away, I went on my way. No charge.

Boy, did I feel vulnerable, powerless, and stupid. I don't like it. And
I'm still stung over the criticism of my work. The oil light doesn't
come on after I do the valve adjustment!

THEN!!! I got the claim for the repairs to Wendelin. Over $3,000!!!
She's totalled for sure. And I'm gripped with what I hope is an
irrational fear that I might lose her. At the very least I'm going to
have to go through DMV bureaucracy about salvage and title issues and
safety inspections. Never mind the expense.

I'm not a happy camper today.

&gt; It's of to use the distributor to see which cylinder
&gt; you're coming up on for adjustment but after that crank pulley marks are
&gt; the way to go.
&gt; 
&gt; BTW how DID they clean threads and install inserts
&gt; without removing the heads first to keep the metal particles out of the
&gt; cylinder or did they?)?
