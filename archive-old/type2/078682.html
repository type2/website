Hi John Here
I know it is a pain in the ass, and that you're going to smell like exhaust 
fumes but start her up and play with some of the vacuum lines. I think you 
might get lucky.  I think sometimes its the really obvious stuff first.  Its 
any easy start.

PS I. Think you mean the throwout bearing it makes an uneasy sound when you 
depress the clutch.
