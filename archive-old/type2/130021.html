Subject: Re: [T2]child seats and child comfort

That's what I thought when I first saw them too, but I've grown more 
safety-conscious since I became a father also.

I took some measurements from seat bottom to seatbelt mount on the vehicles 
I have available to me:

'93 Mustang front seat: 28&quot;
'73 VW bus front seat: 26&quot;
'93 Mustang rear seat: 23&quot;

'73 VW bus C-pillar &quot;mount&quot; (for middle seat?): 18&quot;
'73 VW bus &quot;mount&quot; under rear window (for rearmost seat): 13&quot;

I would want a lot more information before I used those mounts for shoulder 
belt anchors.  My gut tells me they are too low to be safe.

&gt;Good point, David.  Hadn't done any further engineering analysis... just 
&gt;noticed the threaded holes.  Have they ever been used by VW?
&gt;(i.e. in a Euro-spec Bus?)  I'd be curious to see how they were 
&gt;implemented if, as I suspect, they were used for three-point belts.
