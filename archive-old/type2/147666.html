Subject: Re: [T2] oil change gone bad

&lt;&lt;1. timesert and redrilling and tapping both will require the engine be
pulled, or can the bottom come off so all the little metal chunks can be
removed?&gt;&gt;

It can be done in the chassis with care.
 

&lt;&lt;2. it's obvoiusly been leak free with the helicoil fix in place, so
why not go with another helicoil if it saves me from having to pay to
have the engine dropped or whatever a timesert fix would require?&gt;&gt;

The hole MUST be sqeaky clean and you can go with another heli coil
--plus use some lock tite on the threads prior to running the new coil
into the hole.
This will keep it from backing out again. 


&lt;&lt;3. as far as rubber plugs go are these called expansion plugs? freeze
plugs? i can't seem to find much searching the local auto parts store
websites.&gt;&gt;

These are temporary cures at best, just a situation like this---
You'll probably have a hard time locating one on the interenet.
Take a ride to any NAPA dealer, and they'll mre than likely have one.

 
&lt;&lt;4. ok. i have to ask. what the heck is a FLAPS?&gt;&gt;
