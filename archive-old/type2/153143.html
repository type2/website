Subject: [VB] Re: [T2] Re: [VB] deck height

hi john - i've been digging in my smiths, campbells, elfrinks and 
bergs; while berg of course goes on about too much CR and 
who-cares-about-deck, the others merely stated that deck should never 
be too LOW, and that CR shouldn't be too high UNLESS the motor, part 
quality and fuels were taken into consideration. smith DID say that 
a) in theory, modern (1972) fuels would support a 10% rule, ie, 91 
octane should support 9:1 CR.   he also stated b) many older cars 
were deliberately CR'd low, and they were perfectly fine... although 
he called their performance soft and wooly!

if you have some sources you could cite, i'd love to find them and 
read them. if this is all experience talking, i'd still love more 
details - are you running, say, 9:1 in a bone stocker with modern 
gas, or what do you do to EACH part to get those ratios without 
overheating?  how have the parts held up at at teardown? etcetc.

not DOUBTING you - i just want to know; i'd no more jump off a cliff 
because someone told me it was safe than i would build an engine on 
one mechanic's advice. the problem for me comes from EVERY SINGLE 
PERSON having a different answer, and the others are ALWAYS  WRONG! 
LOL!!!

what would YOU recommend here:
my motor has 50 cc chambers, 88 p&amp;c, a schneider 254F cam
  (254  254   226     226  .385&quot; .385&quot; 107 .004&quot; .006&quot;) or 
http://www.schneidercams_dot_com/cams/113.htm

i currently have a 30/31 on it, but have a 34-p3 in a box waiting. 
stock muffler and heater boxes.  currently has .070&quot; shims, making a 
deck of .13; CR of 6.9:1.  i DO have some .040 shims, which should 
give me 7.3:1, but i am awaiting the great debate to play out here 
before i choose. so don't let us get you so ticked you kick over the 
keyboard :)
