Subject: Worn out choke?

I tried adjusting my choke on my 30 Pict 1 carb
(68 Westy).  It seems like the spring tension is
insufficient.  In order to get the butterfly to 
close, I have to rotate the choke dot WAY past
the ridges on the carb body.  Even then, the
tension doesn't seem to really be enough to get
the fast idle screw onto the upper cam steps.
The type2 tech article mentions that my element 
(spring) might be distorted.  Well, the shape 
looks ok, but I'm guessing that the element
is just worn out.  Does that sound right?  
Anything else that I might be &quot;missing&quot; in my
diagnosis?

Thanks,
Brad Baker
