Subject: Re: [T2] 1968 Bus

aren't the sunvisors different too?  the wiper pivots and possibly more of
the wiper assembly are different too. also has the 67/68 flasher relay,
68/69 reflectors. the 68 speedo cable is supposed to be one year but have
heard others will work. thought the front beam was up to 70??  for the door
handles I --think-- only the 67 and 68 share the same key profile. most of
this stuff isn't too hard to come by, not in these parts anyway. My 71 has
similar over riders but the bumper isnt original to the bus. My 68 had black
VW belts but I don't know if they where original to the truck, they're gone
now.

&gt; &gt;Just a trivial question here( maybe a couple)
&gt; &gt;Were there one year only parts in the 68?
&gt;
&gt; - padded dash board raised above the instrument cluster;
&gt; - rear view mirror;
&gt; - door handles (64-68);
&gt; - windshield wiper arms;
&gt; - i have a set of seemingly 68 only front bumper overriders,
&gt;   have seen matching overriders, larger, on a local 68 westy;
&gt; - master cylinder fill res., and metal line to m/c;
&gt; - idiot lights have no symbols.
&gt;
&gt; Q: do 69 up double cabs have grey weave seatbelts with the crest decal
&gt;      on a metal clasp, or is that 68 only?
&gt;
