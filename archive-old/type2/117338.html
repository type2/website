&gt; &gt; well at least according to Mobil, the synthetics always flow at the lower
&gt; &gt; number and always lubricate at the higher number and do not change
&gt; &gt; apparent viscosity as temperatures change.
&gt; 
&gt; I think that Mobil is using  a little marketing magic here.  If the

right I think it is marketing too, but it also probably more means that it
doesn't breakdown like conventional oils...

&gt; &gt; my experience with synthetics is that there is an ever so slight thinning
&gt; &gt; as the oil gets above 220degrees based on the combination of readings from
&gt; &gt; my oil preasure and temp guages
&gt; 
&gt; The viscosimeter doesn't lie, and if the synthetic oil has a viscosity
&gt; index of, say, 10W50, it would have to have a viscosity/temperature curve

I was only relating my experience with Pennzoil Performax 5W-50 and Mobil1
15W50 nothing should be extrapolated from my single set of experiences.

now I did run a time temp test some years ago between a Sunoco premium
20-40 and Pennzoil Performax 5W50.  this was under essentially identical
weather conditions and about 150 miles including city, interstate and
rural roads and I found the temps were for all intents and purposes
identical.   maybe a hair lower for the synthetics but not statistically
significant.
