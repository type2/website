Gentlepersons-
                      You might try &lt;www.piercemanifolds_dot_com&gt; to see if they 
have an adap-
ter...BTW, they also have rebuild kits for old Webers for those of us who 
shop the re-
cycling yards. Those guys with the Buick/Rover V8 conversions should check 
out the
four Weber manifold...Just for going uphill without downshifting, of course;-)
