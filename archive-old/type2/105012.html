Subject: Re: [T2] top end rebuild ?'s dear lord... =(

&gt;Reality check - blowby will not be cured with a top-end rebuild!  Unless 
&gt;their idea of a top-end rebuild includes honing the cylinders and replacing 
&gt;the rings.

This is exactly what they mentioned doing, sorry for missing that part. Is 
that not a typical part of a top end rebuild?

With honing the cylinders and replacing the rings, along with rebuilt heads 
and labor, is this now a $1700 job?

I haven't paid for anything yet, so they can round up the parts. While they 
might be pissed, I can still cancel this thing and go elsewhere if this 
process sounds shady. I really like these guys, and they never pressed me to 
do this in the first place, just brought it up as an option.

I think the re-ringing thing was what they wanted to do to fix the oil leak, 
but the rebuilding of the heads was what they mentioned I may want to do 
while tackling this issue.

thanks for the tips, keep em coming please, I need to decide today if 
possible. last I checked, even with the oil leak, my compression was good on 
all four.

Christopher
