	So, what are the choices?
	#1  Bite the bullet and fix it. Cables are $94 a piece (need two) at
	Wolfsburg West. Add seals and we are getting into the $400 dollar
range.

[...] Really?  I haven't checked there specifically but everyone else has
been telling me that Bus cables have been NLA for some time now.
