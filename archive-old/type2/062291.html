I have a '79 Westy in Calif., probably averages about 20 mpg....not great
mileage, but good for camping!  So I thinks yours is in the ballpark!  Have
fun!

&gt; Volks,
&gt; 
&gt; My 'loafie has been getting only 15 - 24 MPG.  Just purchased this great 
&gt; bus and I was lead to believe by the PO that I should be getting around 
&gt; 30.  This fuel injected 2 litre engine runs great and starts easy.  No 
&gt; smoke and just passed California smog.  Where do I start?
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks
