Hello Marcus &amp; List          I seen these motors go all to hell, seize 
bearings , throw rods , fry pistons, drop heads, the worst was the one that 
threw the rod thur the case into the 5th injector and burnt the bus to the 
ground.   The motor if  treated right is very tough .  If you come to any of 
the east coast shows , Mannasa,  everbus, knoxville,bristol , high country, 
look me up and we'll talk.  I  usually am in the swap area driving either my 
59 panel, dove grey or my 66 hardtop westy with two wooden westy roof racks 
on it.           Mark Dearing  Salem Import Service     Salem Va.
