&gt;I'd be inclined to look at the ignition and then the FI before thinking 
&gt;about the tank..

&gt;stalling at high rpms's - you wouldn't be able to 'gas through' it 
&gt;because the fuel pump was already delivering all it could when it started 
&gt;stalling.

I realized this just after I hit send.  Oh well, thanks for the 
correction.
