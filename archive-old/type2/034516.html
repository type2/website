Subject: oil filter (the other side)

&lt;&lt;&lt;Those oil filters connected to the pumps are notorious for being
out of
spec. What you are experiencing is a symptom of cheap aftermarket
parts
that are engineered with more emphasis on chrome than on in-spec
measurements. The best approach would likely be to have the case
tapped for
a full-flow setup coming out of one of the oil galleys and use a stock
in-spec oil pump or a high quality over-sized pump. Yes, this requires
tearing the engine down.&gt;&gt;&gt;

i will not disagree that a full flow is better.  just remember ALL vw
bugs coming out of mexico (i believe as of 1998) have the full flow
pump/filter combo on them!! (they also all come with electronic ign.,
hyd. lifters, and i think most are fuel injected). all these new
improvements are on there for a reason.  i would take a pump/filter
combo than NO filter at all, especially since i can put one of these
on in an hour, rather than pull an engine and COMPLETELY tear-down to
put the fittings in.  the cost is about $60, compared to about $150+
to get the case tapped, good fittings, the proper hoses, etc., plus
tear-down time.

yes you can get a crappy aftermarket suppliers.  we all know who most
of them are.  i love swivel valve adjusters, but NEVER made by
bugpack.  look for a oem vw supplier of the filter/pump combo and you
will be fine.
