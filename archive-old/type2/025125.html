Eron, 
 I am in Greensboro, NC and willing to drive out and tow back or take a
Greyhound and drive the bus back...I guess I should ask how much and where
are you located? If we can come to an agreement she will be coming to an
excellent home. I will be ready to buy in July or sooner depending on price.


Thank You,
Scott J. Soehlig

...and the wife is pregnant again, so she's gotta go.
