Subject: Piece o' ring...

I found 2 more pieces - one of the same and another thicker aluminum
chunk.  Pics at:

and on their sides for thickness comparison:

I've had Wunder since the end of last year...  She didn't pass smog, so
she's been sitting waiting for me to get 'er tuned up so she will.  I
figured I would do oil, plugs, wires, cap, rotor, fuel and air filters,
valve adjust and take her to someone for timing and FI adjustment.

I pawed back through the PO's paperwork - in Dec '93, she had the
following parts &amp; work:

valve guides
pistons &amp; cylinders
engine gasket set
cam follower
exhaust valve
cam bearing set
main bearing set
temp sensor
bellows
rod bearing set
flywheel seal
push rod tube
clutch return spring
ignition switch

machine cylinder head &amp; grind valves, remove engine &amp; overhaul, &amp; an oil
change

They noted the mileage as 554, she shows 52,545 now.

She runs good - no horrendous sounds, absolutely NO smoke of any color,
ever, out of the tailpipe.  She doesn't rip, drip or run down yer
leg...  Everything looks good...

Rather than assuming the worst NOW, wouldn't a compression check show if
these were pieces of the current rings?  Or maybe the condition of the
plugs would give me a clue?  That's next.

Oh, I also strained the drained oil.  Nuthin' there.
