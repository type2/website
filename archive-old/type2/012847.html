&gt;&gt; Uh, I'm not seeing this &quot;vehicle cross member&quot; on my '79 deluxe.
&gt;
&gt;That would be the rear engine mount crossmember.
&gt;
&gt;If you dont have it, DONT DRIVE!!!:)

(that's funny David)

I'm going to add something, AVOID THIS HITCH AT ALL COSTS, if
you can.  The better hitches for the late bus have a crossmember of
their own that goes all the way across the car, not this cheesy U
bolt over the engine carrier.  Invariably you see thise kind killing the
engine mounts faster, etc. etc.  Prices aren't much different if you can
find the other style, but that can be a big if.  Look in a yard on junk
buses and get a good one volks.
