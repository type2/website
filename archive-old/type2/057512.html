Actually Harmon Seaver wrote the above, I merely agreed.  Gotta be a

&gt;Ok... Provided my flaps are in working order and my timing is in place,
&gt;how do I know if I've got my fuel mixture just right?  And what is an
&gt;acceptible margin of error?
&gt;
&gt;I've set my mixture screw per Bentley, i.e. turned all the way in, then
&gt;out 2.5-3 turns, and then out more based on idle speed.  Is there 
anything
&gt;else?  Or any way to know (backfiring, etc) that the mixture is 
correct?

Well your running mixture is semi-permanently set.  Carburetors use 
removable jets to set up the air/fuel mixture.  I'm not too clear on 
what's involved in changing these around, being more FI oriented.  The 
mixture you set with those screws on the side is merely the idle 
mixture, which of course is only relevant when the engine is idling.  
The other adjustment you make is at the accelerator pump, which 
determines how much fuel is squirted into the carb throat when you hit 
the gas. 

Bentley seems to indicate that if your engine backfires when your foot 
is off the gas and the engine is being overrun by the car, your idle 
mixture is too lean.  I don't know if that sounds counterintuitive or 
not, but that's what Bentley says :-)
