Subject: Re: [T2] Leaky CV boot

Hi Blake,

You should never use a hose clamp on your CV boots as they are unbalanced. The clamps used had a compression section in them which although it results in an imbalence is much less than a hose clamp.

In the abscence of a prober CV boot clamp then a wide electrical tie wrap will do the job - cut the end off as close as possible to the ratchet grip to minimise the imbalance - which as a tei wrap is very light will be minimal.

Good luck

&gt; One of my inner cv boots is leaking grease between the boot and the shaft. It looks like it oozes out and then gets &quot;flung&quot; around the underside. The boot is in very good shape, so it just seems like it is not snug enough around the shaft. I read in Bently that these later type boots do not use hose clamps like the ones earlier. Has anyone had this problem before? Does anyone see a reason not to put a hose clamp on?
