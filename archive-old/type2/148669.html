Subject: RE: [T2] Saturday parts delivery?

I back that statement and I'm one city to the East.  It was never like this
is California.  I guess that what I get for not having to deal with the
California problems when I went to smog the vintage wheels. (Bus content)

But alas, it could always be worse.  Except for us that is.  The post lady
actually thought it would be cool to let the mail truck roll down the hill
and run into the side of our garage.  Argh, and my blood pressure was just
starting to go down.

My gripe with USPS is the office here in Highlands Ranch, CO, seems to
have a propensity for losing my packages.
