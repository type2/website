Or you might have a friend at your local full service pharmacy, and get
a quart(HIC!) of 'anhydrous alcohol', 200 proof or 100% alcohol. Costs
around $7.00 if the pharmacist isn't stiffing you! I get mine from my
so's place of employment, mix it with denatured(methanol) as I am a
sober alcoholic(21 yrs., but who's counting!G!)and use for all cleaning
jobs it will work on, like rebuilding brake cyls, some carb work,
sticker removal and as a fuel additive.

My .021/2.

Chris.
