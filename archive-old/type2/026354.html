Although I don't know TOO much about the differences between the classes of
bus, I have a '70 that has the anodizes aluminum trim, and the triple
seating, but is not a walk through.  I have always assumed that my bus was a
Deluxe.  I too am curious concerning this matter.  Anyone out there with the
answer?  Greatly appreciated...

I have a question regarding a '67 21 Window.  I recently looked at one that
has all of the deluxe features, but it is not a walk-thru.  I was under the
impression that all of the deluxes WERE walk-thrus.  Can someone explain
this?

Thanks,
Victor
