&gt; Does anyone know how much clearance there is between the firewall

&gt; I want to mount my new XR700 ignition module close to the series
&gt; resistor. I don't want the sheet metal screws to hit the tank
&gt; if the tank is right up next to the firewall.

be real carefull, but the tank is usually about an inch or so from the
firewall.  of course you could pull the firewall loose without taking it
out and look.up near the very top there is lots for room, like the top 2
inches or so all the way across.

YMMV
