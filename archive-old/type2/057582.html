Subject: carb idiosycracies, can the book be wrong...?:)

Greetings...

Ok, I feel like I've beat this topic to death (at least talking about
carbs) but I'm having trouble with my tune up procedure for my 71 bus.

I've got a 34P3 with stock dizzy (vacuum advance) on an AE case.  Muir,
Bentley, and Haynes say to set the timing at 5 deg. ATDC, which I've done.

I changed plugs, wires, dizzy cap, rotor, points, condenser.

Dwell is ~47 deg (Bentley says 40-50 is acceptible).  I set my timing,
then set the idle per Bentley.

The end result is an engine that idles roughly at ~850 rpms, surges
slightly (25-50 rpms), and when I accelerate, gives me a lot of unburnt
fuel from the exhaust via a bit of black smoke.  It also hesitates a lot
in the first 5 minutes and has a lot less power than it did before the
tune-up.

My thought is that the timing should be a bit closer to 2-3 deg ATDC.
When I rotate my dizzy around, it improves as I move to TDC, but then
idles like crap when I go all the way around to 7 or 10 BTDC.

This is my assessment of the problem, as I see it.  There could also be a
problem with the float/needle valve combo, but I haven't checked that yet.

So my two main questions are:

1)  What are possible sources for this poor performance (hopefully not too
general)?

2)  Is there a &quot;zone&quot; of acceptibility when setting the timing?  Could the
ideal timing for the bus actually be TDC, for example, instead of 5 deg
ATDC?  And if so, how can you tell if you've gone too far to prevent your
engine from running too hot?

Anyone with some suggestions/answers?  I'm pretty confused by this rocket
science and when I feel like I've set everything according to specs and it
runs like s**t, my troubleshooting abilities begin to suffer...

Thanks...
