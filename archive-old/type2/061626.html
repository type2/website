Hi Ian,

Just a some thoughts on undercoating.  I can't help you with the AC.  I
think this is the perfect stuff for it.  Chainsaw bar oil.  You can get this
by the gallon for about $3 and it has additives that make it perfect.  It
has wax added to it to make it set up a little and stay on the chainsaw.
This is good for obvious reasons in an undercoating application, it just
stays on longer.  It also had rust inhibitors.  This keeps the shiny bare
metal of the chain from ever rusting and kills minor rust that is already
there.  Ditto for the bus.  Plus it is an oil which lubricates the chain and
just keeps water, salt and road grime off your beloved German metal.  Since
it never sets up too solidly, it is 'self healing'.  The oil film will cover
over small areas where rocks hit etc.

Start by getting the bottom of your bus really clean, and then really dry.
A good power wash and then a few days of warm, dry weather ought to work.
RustChek (TM) recommends August!!

I apply the bar oil with a shutz (schutz, stutz?) gun.  This is a little air
powered  gun made for doing undercoating and the like.  You can find them at
any auto store that sells undercoating supplies.  I got mine a few years
back at Canadian Tire.  Hook up your compressor (I think you can also buy
air cartridges for these but I could be wrong) and start shootin'.  It's a
bit messy sometimes.  ;-)

I do it yearly.  That's probably overkill now that I live on the dry side of
Washington but hey, I'm paranoid.  I've lived in Alberta and Ontario so I
KNOW what rusty cars look like.  I use a little less than 2 gallons of oil.
$6 well spent.  I do all the underside and take care to get all of the beam
and doglegs, etc.  I also do inside the bottom of my doors and inside the
bottom of my nose panel.  Basically, anywhere that water might be doing it's
damage.  Make sure any little drain holes you find on your doors are clear
of debris.  These holes let your bus dry out as quickly as possible.

Have fun,
-C
