Subject: Re: undersize rotors

Jm don't listen to any sourpus about what he &quot;THINKS&quot; on the subject.... I
had a '65 micro, dual wheel-cylinder FRONT brakes, no brake booster, and that
Bus had seriously undersized brakes! Talk about stopping within 100 dollars!
The '71-79 brake systems are MAGNIFICENT!

My .02 1/2.
