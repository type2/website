Subject: Re: [T2] mystery fuel injection ECU

From: &quot;Robert&quot; 
&gt; I bought (cheap) a Bosch fuel injection Electronic Control Unit at the 
 Litchfield VW show flea market today,  and I am trying to identify it. 
 It has a green sticker on its side which lists two part numbers. One is 
 a VW number: 043 906 021. The other number is: 0 280 000 105 (I am 
 guessing this is a Bosch number).  These numbers don't correspond to 
 the numbers listed in Bentley. However, it looks like a bus ECU.
 
 Is this a Bus ECU? I bought it hoping I can keep it as a spare for 
 either my '78 or my '79.
 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

I believe you missed the D after 043 906 021?

If yes, you have a 75 to 80 BUG [type I] ECU.  
NO, it will not work on a bus. 
78 Bus ECU's start with 022, 79 start with 039.
