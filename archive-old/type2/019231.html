Subject: Towing a Type 2 ?
Mime-Version: 1.0
X-Originating-IP: 216.206.223.66

I am in the process of trying to buy my first Type 2, a 1974 Westy.  It is
located about 265 miles away and I was considering towing it home.  Will my
1998 Chevy Astro van be capable of pulling the van on a U-haul tow dolly? 
How heavy is the westy?
The Chevy has a 4.8 liter vortec V-6 moter and a good receiver hitch set-up
on it.

Thanks,
