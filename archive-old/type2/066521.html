Subject: Splitting the Case

Two major VW events for me yesterday: I bought Tom Wilson's How to Rebuild
a VW engine book...and I split an old case I had laying around. I must
say, it was exhilirating and fascinating. Sleep had to DRAG me to bed as I
was mentally glued to the engine internals. For some reason, I thought
they'd be more complex or more imposing.

This case was one that had .014 end play and the crankshaft bound when I
tried to adjust it nearer to .003. I examined the main bearing and the
part of the engine upon which this sits. By flashlight (to supplement my
dim garage light), I couldn't see damage to the case, but I could see some
back-and-forth play when I placed the bearing in either have of the split
case. Sooo...I figure I'm looking at having thrust facing done and putting
a larger bearing in there.

My rod clearances were .018 to .020, so I pulled the rods off and made a
mental note that these would need replacement.

No visible signs of wear on the camshaft, but with the wear on the rods,
I'm guessing I'll find some on the camshaft and lifters. The signs, as far
as I can read them, all point to a clean engine suffering from age/miles.
I am confident that with align bore and thrust facing, this engine can
live again. 

I'm going to look at a used $150 engine today, so I may have a little more
time to play with this and my other engine (now squirting oil and making
funny hissing sounds at one head)--the result of a top-end only
rebuild/roll-of-the-dice and apparently over-advanced timing resulting in
overheating and likely head damage (all my fault, of course--good thing
I learn from experience ;). 

I plan to try putting this case back together for practice.  If/when I'm
able to succeed at that task, I'll pull the engine in the bus, split that
case, and start on the journey of building a proper engine. ...so stay
tuned for a bombardment of rebuild questions .._dot_coming to a listserv near
you later this summer.

Cool! &quot;Honey, I need more tools.&quot;

Man, this stuff is fun! 8) Joe
