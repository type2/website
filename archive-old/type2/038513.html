Subject: Steal of a deal On a 79 Westy In Atlanta!!!

Hello everyone..I am trying to help my friend sell his 79 Westy in 
Atlanta....The bus is in very good shape..well maintained...65,000 original 
miles on the body..needs a new canvas and a rebuild engine..Kermit the Frog 
Green..Inside is in excellent condition...This bus would be perfect for 
someone who can rebuild motors...He is asking $1500.00 obo for the bus...Let 
me know and I will give you his email...This is the original owner...and 
there is such low mileage because his parents would tow the Bus behind a 
trailer when they traveled...Let me know if anyone is interested..Must go to 
a good home..but nothing but good people on this list...so it will be a steal 
for someone...Thanks--Adam

1971 Westy &quot;Bulli&quot;
St. Augustine, Fl
