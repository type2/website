&gt; 	Ok, I oversimplified. Our '70 has got a 1600 single port,
&gt; pure stock 34 PICT-3 and an extractor-to-bugpack exhaust (regular
&gt; heat exchangers). It cruises at an INIDICATED 65 at about half
&gt; throttle, maybe a bit more, but plenty of space under the pedal. 
&gt; I have NOT calibrated the speedo. I've also got 15 inch rims on
&gt; the rear (DPO's doing, not mine) and that should make it a bit
&gt; faster than indicated, larger wheels go farther per rpm, right?

True, but since your speedometer is driven by the left front wheel the
rear wheel size doesn't affect the speedometer.

The engine does turn slower, but would have to put out the same amount
of power to keep up speed.
