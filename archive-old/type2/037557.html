Second would be to get an
impact screw driver, the kind that you hit with a hammer.
These are available from most tool outlets(Harbor Freight,
Sears,JC Whitney).

I have one of these and they are the only way I have been able to get some
stuck screws lose, NO not the normal way the tool is used by whacking it
with a hammer but:
Mine has a removable end, where you put the screw driver end your going to
use, this is the EXACT size as the normal socket wrench, then attach this to
your socket wrench and you have a good high torch screw driver. I have
removed engine hinge screws with this method.
Another important thing to do when removing a stuck screw it to tap it lose
with the screw driver end, in other words DON'T apply constant pressure to
the screw head, this is where they strip out. This is similar to hitting it
with a hammer a couple of times, this seams to work better for me, of course
when you have a 6 inch socket bar as a breaker you can get allot more torch
to the screw.
Hope this helps also.
