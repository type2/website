Subject: Re: [T2] 78 Westy 2.0L engine weak fire

Hi Chris,

        You might be on to something. Worked on problem today and vacuum
is weak. Used carb cleaner in intake vacuum hose and cleaned out, helped
some but still have problem while warming up. I will check more tomorrow.

        Thanks
        Ralph 78 westy
