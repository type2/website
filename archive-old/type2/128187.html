Subject: [T2] Carbs go opposite sides

ok just bought and installed dual carbs from cb performance...
first off they left out my fuel T in the package but would have traded it for some instructions any day...
there was instructions but very limited... basically a pic... thats it with a small description...
here is the same paper that comes with the carbs ,...,.
http://www.cbperformance_dot_com/images/T4-dual-solex-instructions.jpg
 
on the paper it has them set up the same way i put them on the engine
my carbs push open and most folks tell me there carbs pull open..? so could i actually have them on the wrong sides...?
the linkage is very bad flemzy as welll exspecially when comparing to anyone elses carbs rather them be solex or weber or dellotoros....flemzy meaning that they are very thin and also are at there ends as far as they will extend.....
so could i have been so dumb and looked at the pic( remember only instructions to go by and put them on correctly.)... ?
thanks
chris
