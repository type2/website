Subject: Re: I AM GOING TO wimper.!!!!!!! or cry

I second Jamie's suggestion. I had this problem and cleaning these 
grounds, which ground the EFI system, solved it.  Cleaning this connection 
should be a routine maintenance item they are so critical. There is 
really no reason to keep these grounds in such an inaccessible location, 
the tab could be on any accessible case bolt.  The way I read the wiring 
diagram, the EFI system and the rest of the bus have separate power and 
grounding paths. This may be due to a desire to avoid starter current 
going back through the EFI wiring if it were done differently, and the 
engine ground strap failed. The original spade connections are getting 
pretty old by now.  As I recall, without there being a good ground here 
there is no drive current for the injectors. From searching the list, 
and other sources, I read that the EFI box very rarely goes bad. I do 
however, carry a spare, more as a threat to the one in use than expecting 
to use it. :).   jon

&gt; she'll start but she runs very very rough, will not idle, will not
&gt; rev.

I am going to guess,,, a bad ground under the air distributor....

there is still hope&quot;.
