Subject: [VB] Re: [T2] Rust Converter's Results and Finding's.

I'd like to add that it sounds like you didn't follow the directions.

The surface should not be prepped as a normal surface would need to be.    The
POR-15 adheres better to a slightly rusty surface.  I sounds like you got it
as clean as you could.  I used this on a 73 bug when I restored it in 1991.
The places where I used it are still perfectly preservedwhile places I didn't
think I needed to worry about have started showing signs of rust.

Other than that, you are pretty much right on.  The stuff is hard as a rock
and great for places where undercoating would be used.  I would agree that you
shouldn't use it to restore a radio flyer waon - unless you want to tow it
behind a bus in the snow.  ;-P

Bob,
 For the bottom of the vehicle I would have to say this stuff would work
well.
I'm telling ya it's hard as a rock--no doubt.

I would still overcoat it with something though--like either bed liner
or undercoating just to be on the safe side.

For under rubber mats on screwed up floors of a Bus or Van--I can see it
being used there too with good results--but this is just about the end
of the line of it's usefulness for me--

It stinks like the worst paint I have ever applied--almost as bad a
Imron--and it like crawls into your pores---phooey !!

I could see maybe, at best, using it for a small touch up spot--and I do
mean only a spot---pin hole whatever--but forget doing a whole vehicle
with it--

My DA with 180 paper on  it was smoking trying to get the stuff scuffed
prior to refinishing.

What you spent on the Vari Prime, and Uro Prime, just saved you hours in
aggravation time---

You'll thank me one day---:&gt;)


Take Care--


TK


&lt;&lt;&lt;what about using it as a really tough underbody coating where you
don't care about appearences and &quot;tough&quot; is the real goal -- keep an eye
on that part too if you can. may not look good but you used it on a
tough beast and could be a good test of the rust prevention part of
it.... (hey it is a lot cheaper than the vari prime etc, and for
underbody work it could have a low cost use....
