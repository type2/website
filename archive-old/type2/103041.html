Subject: Re: [T2] fuel cutoff solenoid

&gt;I think you need to include the fuel rail, pressure regulator into you
&gt;equation,, and,
&gt;
&gt;And, what about the return line to the gas tank,,, won't it allow gas to 
&gt;fuel a
&gt;fire if it happens to get damaged?

Very, very good points. Had not considered that there were two fuel lines 
because of the fuel injection.

I'll be buying two valves now I suppose!!!

Thanks Jamie!

I'll share with the list what i buy when I get to that point months from now.
