Subject: '67 color schemes

Has anyone compiled a list of factory offered paint schemes for a '67 bus?

I'm also interested in info on seat covers.  I have catalogues from the 
common parts places (RMMW, WCM and a few others I can't think of...) and 
have only noticed one-color vinyl covers.  My bus has seat covers of 
fabric and vinyl, and the fabric portion has a striped pattern rather than 
a solid color.  The panels aren't one color either, and they also have 
aluminum trim.  None of the advertised replacement panels I've seen are that 
fancy.  Does anyone know of another source?
