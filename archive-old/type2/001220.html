&gt;I thought I'd mention that I just spent a couple hours cleaning the fan on
my 1700cc type4 engine. It was black and covered with a hard, crusty grime.
Seemed to me that a clean fan might help the bus run cooler.

Hey Rich, I just had the same entertainment.  I figured that if the hollows
of the blades cake up with gunk, they won't suck as much air.  So we'll see,
maybe now our fans will be more efficient as well as more attractive.

Regards,

Grant
