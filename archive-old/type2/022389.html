It is that time of year again...

Peach State Transporters will be holding it's 5th Annual Dead of
Winter Campout at Cloudland Canyon State Park in the NW Georgia
mountains February 2-4.  The park is off GA 136, 8 miles east of
Trenton and I-59, 18 miles NW of Lafayette.  Those interested can
email me for more details.

Last year we had about twenty buses over the weekend.

There are two different campgrounds, and they have cabins for those
of you who don't like cold weather camping.  Campsites have water
and electric hookups, so bringing space heaters is a good idea.

There are great hiking trails down to the waterfalls as well as around
the canyon rim.  So bring warm clothes, extra blankets, musical
instruments, firewood, and come join us for a great winter campout.

&quot;Located on the western edge of Lookout Mountain, Cloudland
Canyon is one of the largest &amp; most scenic state parks in Georgia.
The park provides visitors with beautiful vistas of the rugged geology
of this area and an excellent outdoor setting for the camper or hiker
wanting to experience the beauty of the natural world.&quot;
