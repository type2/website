I had a similar problem once, spent lots of time and effort in the fuel
system and it turned out to be a coil.  When it overheated, it was
shorting out and would only run the engine at idle.  Eventually it
failed completely and I figured it out.

Another possibility is the intake screen in the gas tank getting plugged
up.

&gt; It happened again on the (cold!) way home this morning.  Driving along
&gt; everything seems fine, then suddenly the engine seems to just go to idle
&gt; regardless of where the pedal is, I described this before as loss of power, I
&gt; guess it is, anyway, it seems to go to idle and start shaking all around
&gt; because I am usually in 3rd or 4th and engine idle is not enough to keep it
&gt; going in those gears.  I usually put it in neutral and pump the gas a little,
&gt; and it goes a way for a little bit.  I have no idea what the problem is.  My
&gt; fuel pump was &quot;repaired&quot; not replaced, so I am thinking maybe a fuel delivery
&gt; problem, or timing maybe?  Any ideas would help keep my from having heart
&gt; attacks when I lose power all of a sudden.
