Subject: Vent Glass

Thanks for the offlist help with the &quot;urgent Transmission help!&quot; post a few weeks ago. Turns out the replacement trans was much older than I expected. Works well now. Though I'm not very happy with the gear ratio. Anyway Does anyone have a passenger door vent glass laying around for a 77 bus. I couldn't find my keys this morning and somehow ended up locked in the bus. DUH. I couldn't pry it open but the hammer worked just fine. Thanks for any help. oh I'm located on Long island,NY
