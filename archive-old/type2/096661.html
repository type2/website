Subject: 1979 VW Westi camper for sale

 

Hello , I have a 1979 VW camper for sale . It has a 2.0L fuel injected motor ,

new alternator , new fuel pump , new voltage regulator , new tires , new fuel

filter , new fuel delivery hoses . The motor has HIGH miles on it and the

rings are bad , causing the oil to leak from the front seal . The motor still

runs good but it's time to rebuild it , I don't have the time to do it . The

transmission is an automatic with a new pan gasket and filter , it shifts

perfectly and runs strong . I just don't have the time to do the work it needs

. The body has no rust , it was painted blue with a black stripe before I

bought it over 2 years ago . The sink works , and so does the interior camping

light , it is a pop top . I live in Atlanta Ga . , I just moved so I can be

reached by email or my roomates cell phone at 404-808-7448 . The price is

$700.00 .
