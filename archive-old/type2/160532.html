below. Ask Daniella.

&gt;
&gt; Hello campers!!!
&gt;
&gt; I have my '69 bus here parked in my driveway that I would like to offer
for
&gt; free to anybody in Bus Camp or anybody you may know.  This bus would need
a
&gt; motor to drive but has good tires, sliding door, all the glass including a
&gt; good windshield.  It is missing pop-up top and the interior is not so
good.
&gt; Could be a parts bus or would make an excellent start for that art car
party
&gt; bus you've always dreamed of.  I drove this bus to BM in 2003 and 2004 and
&gt; camped in Bus Camp in '04.
&gt; I have a '79 Westy now that I am doing the body work on and a new paint
job
&gt; and hopefully will be re-joining you all in 2007.  I have a four month old
&gt; baby and just don't think it would be such a good idea to take her just
yet.
&gt;   Although if I got handed a ticket I would have a hard time saying no.  I
&gt; miss all of you so much and look forward to seeing you in the
future!  Help
&gt; me find a home for this bus or I'll have to take her to the junk yard.
&gt;
&gt; Love,
&gt;
&gt; Daniella
