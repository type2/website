Subject: Re: bilge blower install

On buses that came with a booster fan there is a relay
that is energized from the front of the bus with a
contact built into the lever arm for the heat. When
the lever is all the way open (down) the ckt is
completed which activates the relay and the relay
shunts electrons to the fan.
 Fans have a relativly high current draw which is why
you would want use a relay. If you install a bilge
blower fan in line with the main heater tube I would
advise useing the relay that is provided for the
engine compartment booster fan ()Assuming you wont be
using this fan any longer().
If your bus didnt come with the booster fan then I
would go buy a 12 VDC relay.
Activation voltage will be 12 VDC
Relay should have a NO&lt;normaly open&gt; and NC&lt;normaly
closed&gt;
You want to hook to the NO contact.
This means that with no activation voltage to the
relay the contact is open and the fan is off. When you
hit the switch at the front of the bus the activation
voltage is applied to the relay CLOSING the contacts
and supply voltage to the fan.
WHY USE A RELAY?
  A relay draws very little current so you aren't
loading down the ckt at the front of the bus.
  The wire from the battery to the relay then to the
booster fan should be thicker to allow for the higher
current draw. Chances are the original wiring to a
switch at the front of the bus will be thinner and
wont handle the high current draw as well (it will
heat up).
  Useing a relay you could use the ckt that runs the
defroster element in the back window for example.
  First buy your fan. The info with it will tell you
how much current it draws. armed with this info you
can shop for your relay. Relays are spec'ed to how
much current they can handle. The same marine store
you get your fan from should have good 12 VDC relays.
INSTALL AN IN-LINE FUSE BETWEEN THE RELAY AND YOUR
BATTERY CONNECTION (this will protect the relay and
the fan). That is the wire that the fan is actually
running from. The ckt from an existing switch in the
front of your bus, if factory, will be running through
the fuse panel. 
 BTW, you can figure out what size wire to use for a
given application by doing a search on the web. Most
decent electrical supply house sites have charts for
sizing wire.
