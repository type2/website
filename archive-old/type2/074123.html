&gt; Admin contact for the site (and the presumed mastermind behind the spam) is
&gt; Mr. Jesus Rodriguez de Vera of Miami &lt;ssd_at_mindspring_dot_com&gt;.
&gt;
&gt; vwaddicts_dot_com is downstream from indyserv_dot_net, which has no functional web
&gt; page, and fictitious administrative contact information, and is listed in
&gt; several spam blacklists. Complain to &lt;abuse_at_verio_dot_com&gt; quoting the entire
&gt; spam INCLUDING FULL HEADERS or they can't help.

Even better....

I know the manager of abuse at verio. She's one of my good friends. let me
talk to her tomorrow.

It's good to have friends in high places ;)
