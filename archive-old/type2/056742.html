Subject: z-bed mechanism

Sorry for the bandwidth (I have no idea what that means, but it sounds 
courteous and it's in context).

Could someone p-mail a description of their z-bed mechanism? What are the 
pieces, and how do they work? I'm going to fabricate one for my '76; 
whenever I get a chance to look at one, I botch the chance. (I haven't 
quite got the gift of gab, or something).

I know this is a lot to ask, and it will probably take an exchange or two 
before I get an accurate picture down.
