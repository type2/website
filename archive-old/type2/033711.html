&gt; Dear All,
&gt; 
&gt; I have got a little emergency on my hands:
&gt; The 1979 2L Devon Moonraker of a friend of mine who is staying over
&gt; here in
&gt; London was driving fine up to now and since last night has difficulty
&gt; selecting gears.
&gt; At traffic lights it is impossible to get the car into anygear at all
&gt; apart
&gt; from reverse which gives a horrible noise from the gearbox. After
&gt; that it
&gt; is then possible to get into all the gears again until the next stop
&gt; at a
&gt; traffic light.
&gt; 
&gt; We managed to get gome from central London last night and trying to
&gt; get
&gt; back in to fist gear  while the bus was till rolling seemed to make
&gt; it a
&gt; bit easier.
&gt; 
&gt; So far it was possible to take the car out of gear but getting it
&gt; back in
&gt; was difficult. Since this morning it has started to be increasingly
&gt; difficult to even get the car ou;t of great and disengadging the
&gt; clutch.
&gt; i.e. engine stalles at traffic lights since the clutch does not fully
&gt; disengaged.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; I am lost!!!
&gt; whats wrong? clutch? through out bearing, gearbox???

Ok relax your mind, as the gearbox is probably OK.  It is something
wrong with your clutch most likely.

First thing to check is the free play in the clutch pedal.  If it is
excessive, then it is probably something in the clutch linkage.  

Often a cable will partially break which makes things go way out of
adjustment so that you can't disengage the clutch.

Less often, the problem is in the throwout bearing, but those sort of
failures mean that you don't get any clutch disengagement at all.

If the clutch free play is correct, then you might have a seized pilot
bearing that is making it impossible to disengage things.  This will
require pulling the engine for bearing replacement, but at least the
tranny's OK!
