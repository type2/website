Subject: [T2] Re: Exhaust leak

Hi,
	I'm working the same problem on my bus at the moment. FWIW here's my
 story so far:

 A while back I started to notice &quot;exhaust smell&quot; in the cab.. not strong at
first
 but it did seem to be exhaust not oil burning off. One giveaway is that
exhaust
 fumes smell of petrol first thing in the morning because of the choke,
whereas 
  I got a few headaches when driving (alarm bells ringing!) started driving
with the
 heat off, vents open, windows open. Also noticed that the exhaust system
was &quot;blowing&quot;
 (ie funny noises, occasional popping on overrun- suggesting a leaky
exhaust).
 No time to work on it so I took it to a  garage that does good VW work.
They 
 tightened the exchanger to head nuts (replaced one that had dropped out)
but said
 that with the oil leaks and stuff they couldn't be sure what the problem
was without
 taking things apart- could get expensive, maybe heads coming loose,
possible rebuild!!!

  So- they know VWs but not aircooled ones... (damn!) OK: still no time to
work 
on it but it's summer and I need to drive so I disconnect the heat tubes and
keep
driving. No more exhaust in the cab (well, occasional whiffs when underbody
air
gets sucked through, but nothing serious). I change the oil and replace the
iffy
crush washer on the drain plug and the oil leaks stop (hmm, maybe the heads
arn't
pulling off after all? :-).
 The exhaust blowing gets steadily worse, and I can't see any way for
exhaust to
recirculate into the heat intake so I figure I have a holed exchanger
(wonder 
which side?). Finally, I make time to park up the bus and investigate. The
silencer
comes off (damn those nuts!) and I drop the nearside exchanger as that's
where I
lost a stud, so the most likely place for a crack to develop. Sure enough
there's
a hole 10mm across where the #3 exhaust outlet enters the finned internals
of the
exchanger. A chunk of aluminium housing and fin has broken off.

 I ordered an new exchanger today- the old one was a Dansk, and the new one
will
have to be, too, as JK only have offside ones from Germany :-( It wasn't
quite two
years old, which is pretty poor in my view... still the lost stud was
probably 
contributory. I am assuming that the offside on is OK, may regret that later
but
it seems a fair bet at the moment!

 The exhaust/heat system is pretty simple (unless you have one of thos funny
cat
things bodged in). The exhaust comes out of the heads, into the exchanger,
out
of the exchanger to the silencer and then out of the tailpipe. To get
exhaust
in the cab it either has to get sucked into the heat system (intake or
pipes)
from the outside air as a result of a leak in a critical place or some sort
of weird airflow problem (eg engine lid open and intakes sucking in fumes
from
behind the bus) or blown into the system inside the exchangers. I had a
leak problem in my old '71, once, where a blowing head pushed exhaust past
the (corroded) exchanger edges into the system.

 In the first case you can try to fix the leak/airflow problem- a bit of 
welding or patching with exhaust paste/bandages etc can stave things off
for a while, though don't expect much heat in the meantime- the slightest
leak from the heat pipes will dramatically reduce the efficiency of the
system.
 In the second case you're pretty much stuffed- the only fix is a new 
exchanger and the only workaround is to disable the heat. At this time
of year that may be an unattractive option, unless you live in florida
(or somewhere antipodean!).

 Hope this helps. If you need to pull the system yourself then come back
to the list for advice on how to dismantle the system without breaking
studs etc.

Cheers,
	 W.
