Subject: Re: catalytic heaters

      I've been looking at these Platinum Cats too -- they look pretty
neat and efficient. Since it's a powered exhaust, you can put the outlet
vent anywhere you want, up/down/out the side, etc. I don't see any
problem with the flexible fuel hoses, but I'm not sure I'd want it in
the ceiling as you describe. You wouldn't be able to have it on when you
were sitting back there or in bed, I'd think it'd be much too hot.
     Placement is, in fact, one problem with it. Where to put it? I
think under the dash on the passenger side might be a good place, or
else on the side of the base of the backwards facing seat (at 14'x12&quot;x
5 3/8&quot; I don't think that would be to obtrusive). Otherwise I've thought
of the floor right between the seat and the icebox, although that might
warm up the icebox too much.
     The weight is 9lbs, BTW.  The other nice thing about the powered
exhaust is that it forces an air change in the room (vehicle) so you
don't have any problem with having to open a window or worrying about it
while you're sleeping. They are RV rated, pretty safe.
      The company is Thermal Systems, Inc. at  206-352-0539 if you want
their catalog.
