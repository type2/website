This weekend I pulled the engine to do a lot of little things I've been
meaning to do when it wasn't so hot outside.

Pulled it yesterday, did about a hundred little chores, put it back in this
afternoon. Redid all gas lines, fine. Hooked up all the electrical bits on
the engine, fine. Everything back like it was.

Put the negative cable back on the battery, about ready to cruise around
the block and make one last check for the smell of gasoline--and the hot
wire to the alternator immediately LIT. I don't mean the insulation melted,
I mean the wire is vaporized. By the time I got the ground strap back off
the battery there was nothing left of the wire but the ends, and clouds of
smoke.

I cannot possible have hooked it up wrong. There is a hot post on the
alternator and a spade connector for the ground, I can't mix them up. I had
marked the wire, and anyway I know where that wire goes. That's the only
post-style electrical connection on the whole engine.

Nothing else melted or even got hot but that one wire.

Now I'm scared to death to hook it up with a new wire and try it again.
Anybody have a clue what went wrong? I don't *think* the insulation wore
off the wire so it could ground against the shrouding, it was a fairly
new-looking wire and besides, why now at this very time?

TIA,
