Subject: Speaking of Oil...

I've been perusing the archives about synthetic oil, trying to decide if 
synthetic is the way to go or not. Muir's books says every 1,500 miles. 
Basically I'm lazy and if using synthetic oil will allow me to change less 
frequently, I'm there.

So my questions are: Should I use synthetic oil? If so what brand Weight 
5-50? Frequency of oil changes?
