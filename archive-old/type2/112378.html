&gt; Has anyone been to &quot;Heat, Rust and Noise in VWs by G. Matthew Bulley&quot; 
&gt; in
&gt; the library lately?  I would like to ref it as it had some great 
&gt; detailed
&gt; advice, however..... It appears to be a dead link.  If anyone could 
&gt; get me
&gt; a copy of it, I'd appreciate it.  Thanks, list!

I dug this out of archive_dot_org a couple weeks back and archived it on my 
web server:

	http://www.shagadelic_dot_org/VW/info/gmbulley-soundproof/

I've been meaning to tar up the lot and forward it to the type2 admins 
to actually put the content in the library (rather than a reference), 
but have been short on time and keep forgetting to do so.
