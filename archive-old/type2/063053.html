Subject: re: AK!! My throttle stuck in FLOORED position, 78 Westy!

&gt; I put it in neutral and engine immediately begins
&gt;racing. I pull over, park, run to the back of the bus, and find my engine
&gt;spewing exhaust like those ones in the engine blow display at a Volks show. 

Hey, surfer Bob:

I'm no good mechanic, but:
  1.  Cleaning the gunk stopped one of my throttle pedals to unstick. ('75 Camper)
  2.  Another throttle had a tendency to pinch the thick wire that goes between the pedal and the 
bellcrank against the steel of the floor.  This was remedied by bending the tang on the pedal, and 
adjusting the clip that holds the wire in place.  I'm not sure how well this will work, since the 
engine went down (broken valve) a month after I made the adjustments.  Worked fine in the interrim, 
however.
  3.  I had a ca. '72 in 1987 which had a linkage that stuck at the engine compartment end.  I did 
just what you did, except as I passed the left rear fender to shake the throttle loose, I heard a 
&quot;pop---squeek---&lt;silence&gt;.&quot;  This sequence was the sound of bi-metal friction welding happening in 
right there in my own engine.  I was a little late to patent the process, so all I got from the 
situation was the chance to buy a rebuild.  (At the time, I thought I was too busy to learn how to 
do it myself.  Between my stupidity and the carelessness of the rebuild shop, I ended up scrapping 
the engine, and selling the remainder to a local who needed to make one bus from two.)
