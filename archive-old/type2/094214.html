Subject: Re: [T2] gen to alt conversion

Why do you need to bypass the voltage regulator?  Do you have an internally
regulated alternator?  If you don't have the experience to wire this
yourself, you may need to hit a salvage yard

&gt; sorry if this has already been discussed, but i have a long trip next
&gt; weekend (about 8 hours?) and i cant seem to get anyone to hook up the
&gt; wires on my alt so i can drive my bus (newly rebuilt engine, hasnt been
&gt; driven yet).
&gt; 
&gt; anyway, i have a 1970 bus, stock engine, had to switch out my gen cuz the
&gt; gen light was staying on and the battery wasnt getting charged. got the
&gt; alt from the bug in the bus and now i dont know what wires to hook up or
&gt; how! i know i have to bypass the voltage regulator, but aside from
&gt; that... i have NO clue!
&gt; 
&gt; i am not a mechanic, so please speak in layman's terms (ie: big red wire,
&gt; little green wire, push on plug, bolt on connector, etc....)
&gt; 
&gt; thanks for your expertise...
