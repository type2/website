X-Diagnostic: MESSAGE REQUIRES APPROVAL

Hi folks
I have 2 heads to match up,both are 021-101-371S 1800 41mm x 34mm
 one head has 54cc's in each cylinder,, the other has 56cc's... the 56cc
head has approx 1mm step that looks like a shim but is cast as part of the
head,,, is that a california head? Should I machine out this step?
I would like to know if I should add a shim to make the 54cc into 56,,, or
machine the 56cc's so they have 54,,
I have 1.8L carb engine with 92.98 pistons,dished pistons, and I do not know
my deck height right now,, is that standard,, or should I measure it,
I guess i cannot calc my compression ratio with out the deck height,,, but
how do i figure in the dish in the piston,,, do i have to cc that also?

Btw,,, I plan on running this engine with CIS fuel injection
Thanks
