Subject: Re: Westy sink/icebox unit questions

Two questions really,

1. A few months ago I replaced the front door seals on my 72 with new ones
from WCM.  They seemed like really nice seals, but after many door
adjustments I still have to slam the doors in order for them to shut all the
way.  Is there a trick I'm missing?  I thought that after a while they would
sort of just wear into place.

2. Does anybody know if the heavy wire support that Jaime describes below
came on the 72 Campmobile model.  If so, I am in serious need of one.  I
will gladly pay, trade or whatever.  If not, what supports the sink top
table on the 72?

Thanks,

&gt; Also, there is a support made of heavy-guage,
&gt; chrome-plated wire that supports the &quot;table&quot; while in
&gt; use....  The support is triangular in shape, and is
&gt; attached to the icebox/sink cabinet via clamps that
&gt; allow it to swing out to support the table, as well as
&gt; to lay flat against the cabinet for easy passage
&gt; between the cabinet and the rear-facing seat when the
&gt; &quot;table&quot; is in the &quot;down&quot;, or unused, position
&gt; (assuming that you have a walkthrough bus...).
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; This is what my cabinet/table/support looks like when
&gt; viewed from the rear seat (or z-bed, in my case)...

&gt;      &quot;Table&quot;         Sink/Icebox cabinet top...
