Subject: Re:  Cost Effectiveness of Points Replacement

Hello, I'll chime in here about CDI's, but not from VW experience.  I 
used them on 2-stroke road and racing bikes back in the late 70s and 
early 80s.  They did go between the standard points and coils in the 
aftermarket versions.  They passed practically no current through the 
points so that the only wear was the rubbing block - i.e. if you lubed 
the points cam regularily the points would last a &lt;very&gt; long time and 
require much less adjusting.  The other attribute that made them good 
for 2-strokes was that they sent multiple firing pulses to the points 
each time they fired - something like 5-10 times -  with the first one 
being very strong and the subsequent ones decreasing exponentially.  
This tended to give a better initial fire and the rest of the firing 
pulses either burnt what was left hanging around or cleaned the plug for 
the next time.  At least up until the late 90s they were still in use on 
2-stroke motocross engines using a magnetic pulse to fire them rather 
than points.  I also used them on opposed twin 80s BMW motorcycles which 
have the same, pardon the expression, crude combution chamber as the VW 
- so I would image that they would give the same - smoother running, 
more reliable firing, and extended point life that it did on the BMW.  
They were very reliable, and if they failed all you had to do was 
re-wire/switch the points directly to the coil and go.  They worked 
equally well with just about any kind of coil, including stock Japanese 
motorcycle coils which were not known for fire power.  HTH.
