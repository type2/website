Subject: Irrie Volkswagen Bus!!!

Hey guys,

	I went to the junkyard on Saturday, I was able to get a TON of
stuff. I got a set of vent windows, a windshield, A/C compressor, the
factory A/C under dash unit, and several other items!!!

BUT! Of the two bay window style busses in the junkyard this week, one of
them has this really IRRIE feel about it. The bus looks like it was
recovered from a swamp or deep deep in the woods. The bus is COMPLETE, and
the back seats were perfect (but dirty). I have never seen soo many bugs in
my entire life. There was literally about 1,000 ratt droppings underneath
the seat. There was a horents / wasps nest in every crevice and orifice. The
bus was COVERED in mud. But here's the errie part. Inside the bus, there was
some shreaded clothing, covered in dark brown stains. I'm GUESSING this is
old dried up blood. In addition, there was a whole box of super 8 reel to
reel videos, and several slides. I couldn't help but look at one of them. Of
the one that I looked at, it had a textbook example of a scene from the late
60s. A blond lady.. about 30 something, with a massive blond beehive hair
style, feeding a little baby in the picture. There were all kinds of
personal articles, an old purse, shoes, etc. 

I asked one of the junkyard attendants where they got the car and he said
that it was found out in the woods. They had to bug bomb it several times
because the tow truck driver had gotten stung numerous times when he was
trying to tow it out of the woods. Apparently it was abandoned deep into the
woods and just now they are starting to develop the area and had to pull
that out of there before they could build.

I'm not into astrology or any of that hippiee stuff, but I really got a
weird vibe from that Bus. I can't help but think that something really bad
probably happened to that family like 25+ some odd years ago while they were
on vacation!

Anyway, it was pretty gross, but I still took the back seats from that bus..
all while trying to dodge the wasps. It's crazy what you'll do for good Bus
parts. Anyway.. I was going to take the rubber mat. It had a huge piece of
shag carpet on the floor, and underneath a really nice black rubber mat.
Well, I lifted the rubber mat, only to see close to several thousand
centipedes, silverfish, cockroaches.. you name it. I lifted it only for a
second before I dashed out of the car. My girlfriend (who I dragged out to
the yard for help) said.. &quot;Gross!! Why was the floor moving???&quot; There were
literally hundreds upon thousands of bugs.. there were soo many, that they
were all crawling over eachother.


Anyway, if you guys are still interested in parts.. the two busses are there
at U-PULL-IT off 5-95 in Fort Lauderdale. There is a late 70s Westfalia,
fridge and sink are gone, still has the bed and perfect front seats. BAD
rust damage.

The other one looks like a 1970 (was that the first year?) it has the
running boards along the outside attached to the bumper, unlike my 73 which
has the step when you open the door. That's the one that's got all that
weird crap in it!
