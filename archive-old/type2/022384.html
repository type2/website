&gt;First, I am using AVP heads I bought through
&gt;busdepot_dot_com(looks great and arrived early). I have
&gt;been told by a local VW shop that the most recent
&gt;specs call for the head to be installed without a
&gt;gasket (i.e. metal to metal). This runs contrary to
&gt;what I know about engines but hey I am open minded. 

I use the metal gaskets and will continue to do so regardless of what anyone says, since I have had no trouble this way.


&gt;Second, I would like to hear the pros and cons of
&gt;replacing the heads with the engine in(any worldly
&gt;advise that would help me avoid pitfalls would be nice
&gt;as well). 

I've posted about this before - it's in the archives (vw.i405_dot_com).

&gt;Finally, will I need to do anything special with the
&gt;hydrolic lifters when I install them?  Should I clean
&gt;them in a solvent before I replace them.  

If they are clean, I would just reinstall them.
