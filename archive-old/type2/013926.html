Subject: Re: [T2] anti-sieze



&gt; 
&gt; Hello,
&gt;     I wasn't going to further the thread but... I just removed a spark plug that I had put too much anti-sieze on and I almost cried as I 
tried 
to move it. I had to heat the engine just to move it. When I finally got it out the threads were jammed with the stuff. From now on its 
grease for me. Anyone else run into this? By the way I use anti-sieze on everything else.
&gt; Patrick

Never heard of this problem.  Heating the engine should have made it harder to remove the plug, not easier (yes, the hole gets larger 
relative to the plug, but it also get _longer_ relative to the &quot;reach&quot; of the plug)

Anti-sieze is supposed to seal the mating surfaces so that corrosion cannot take place in the mating region.  Therefore, only a dab of 
anti-sieze is required.  I've never seen a case where anti-sieze jammed anything, and I'm a fairly liberal user of the stuff.
