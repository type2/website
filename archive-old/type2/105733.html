Subject: [T2] Stock vs. Weber Progressive Carb on 1.8L

Was writ........
&gt;I am in the procees of getting my 74 Westy back up and
&gt;running.  It has a 1.8L Type 4 engine.  I have located a
&gt;NOS pair of Solex 32-34 PDSIT-3 carbs.  Would I be better
&gt;off using these stock carbs or going for a Weber
&gt;Progressive setup?

I also have a 74 with an 1800 and I am using a Weber Progressive. Just my
experience here, but I have had no trouble. Starts instantly in any weather,
runs in town and on the highway without trouble, gives me 16 - 20 mpg. I
have no complaint at all about the performance of the Weber.

Also, I live in a temperate zone which is supposed to be prime territory for
the dreaded 'icing' of the intake runners but it has never happened as far
as I know.  By the way, this is my daily driver.

I can't comment as to the stock setup, but I wouldn't hesitate to use a
Weber progressive.

Regards,
Dave
