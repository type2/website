Folks,

New installment on the now-7 week-old engine-replacement saga:

Fed-up with my then-current flake-boy mechanic, who for seven weeks had my
rebuilt 78 2.0l FI engine and still had not managed the relatively simple
process of *putting it back in*, I &quot;re-possessed&quot; it and towed it to an
actual shop reportedly experienced in working our old aircoolers, a certain
Bell Automotive in N. Augusta, SC.

Received a call today, indicating that original ol' flake-boy had completely
hosed things, cut my thermostat cable, removed the flaps, had box after box
of unidentified FI parts.  Faced with the mess my FI had apparently become,
the mechanic suggested I retrofit to a carb setup.  Having been on this list
a while now, I know better, and insisted that it stay.  He capitulated
(nonetheless dismayed at the subsequent workload), but told me that the new
exhaust I provided him (one of those everything-behind the heaterboxes
set-ups) had, mysteriously, an output for a catalytic converter.  Well, mine
was effectively swiss cheese, and this was precisely the reason why I went
for the &quot;everything back&quot; exhaust - I wanted to avoid replacing the cat.
Petunia (the 78 Westy) was originally CA, so all that smog mess was there,
but I've long since moved to Augusta, GA which does not require emissions
testing.

The mechanic and I would both like to know what effect *not* having a
catalytic on this exhaust system would have?  Specifically, what impact on
the FI system?  I am plainly ignorant when it comes to the whole FI process,
despite having read the archives.  And should my exhaust (one of those
four-tip empi-style jobbies) have an output for a cat, or has it been
misidentified?  Can I save the 100 bucks (Ron's cat price), to say nothing
of the INFAMOUSLY obscure cross-pipe thingy?

I simply can't afford the emotional stress of finding another mechanic... so
suggest anything other than that.  There exists, apparently, only one
reputable VW aircooled mechanic in the whole of the metro Augusta area - and
he's a flake, too - in addition to being booked solid for months at a time.
So, I'm stuck with who I've got.  Unless one of y'all is sympathetic enough
to come down here and save me from losing my mind...
