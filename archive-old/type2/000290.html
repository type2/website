I am the office manager for a plumbing supply company and also do freelance
web design. In my spare time I work on Floyd and go hiking , camping and
mountain climbing. I also write freelance for a couple of outdoor magazines
on hiking adventures. Not as glamorous as some of you but I enjoy my freedom
with my bus. Like some of you have also said, I don't carry around anything
more than a spare tire and a jack although I do have a fire extinguisher and
a spare alt. belt.
