I check the archives for this topic, and came away dissatisfied. If you 
were constructing a floor for a camper, how would you do it?

- how many layers?
- of what materials?
- who would you bind the sides and front?
- what glue(s)
- what kind of top surface?

Real experience appreciated, but not absolutely necessary
