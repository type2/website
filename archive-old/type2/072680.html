Subject: type2 again!

I didn't think I would ever be a type 2 person again.  My wife and I have
been longing and dreaming about getting a camper for several years.  First
we wanted a EV cuz they seemed so filled with cool gadgets and amazing
creature comfort--but we decided they were surely out of our price range.

Then we decided on a Vanagan and looked and looked and saw that those too
are very expensive if they are fairly new--and we hate their looks.

The other night, Trish mentioned the possibility of an older bus and I said
that is bad romanticism at best--an act of denial in which all the problems
of air-cooled engines have been forgotten: how cold they are, how they
usually leak oil, how slow they are, etc etc.

Well.  Somehow, we are now the proud owners of a 1973 Westy, with a newly
built engine (2 Liter, hydraulic lifters--6,000 miles), new brakes, clutch,
exhaust system, pointless ignition, new pop top seal and a beautiful
butterscotch color.  I took it to a shop before buying it and they came out
after 1 1/2 hours shaking their heads in disbelief about how sound it is
mechanically.  The exterior is beautiful, the interior is beautiful (even
has the mosquito net for the back).

Trish and I put new bumper and glass stickers on it today (&quot;Right to arm
bears&quot; is one of our favorite.  We are so excited about our new
hobbies--traveling, camping and the campmobile!!  And we can do them all
together!

Being right here right now with our slow campmobile and loving it.
