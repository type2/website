Subject: Any suggestions---part Three

After scratching my head for hours on this one, we finally figured it out.

The AVP engine was using a strange dizzy from AIR Cooled_dot_net.  The 
mechanic who put it together had the dizzy gear in 180 off and the 
changed the wires 180 back.  He did this to get the vacuum can to fit 
in the area.  Yesterday when I was changing out a spare dizzy, I 
didn't realize this.  I guess sometimes two wrongs do make a right. 
But it is very confusing.  Got the van running but it was cutting out 
a lot.  Finally change out the dizzy I had off a 78 and it ran great. 
Evidently the Air cooled_dot_net dizzy's bearing had already gone (5000 
miles) and the mounting plate was bouncing all over the place.  At 
least it happened here in SLC where we don't have to ship it back to 
them.

While we were under the van we noticed that all the CV boots were bad 
so Ed will have to stay another day to get these replaced.

Thanks to all for the help,
