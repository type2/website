Subject: bus for sale in Raleigh, NC area

howdy list,

i found an ad in the paper this past week about a 75 Westy for sale
in my area.

it needs a rebuild on the engine, but from the seller's decription
the interior is in excellent condition &amp; all of the appliances work.

it seemed to be a deluxe westy from his description.

it is one of the lime green &amp; blue/green plaid models.

the ad said 1K, but he told me he would take very little money &amp;
&quot;just needed to get it out of his driveway&quot;.

just passing along the info. i can get the phone number for anyone who
might be interested.

Joel Wilson
