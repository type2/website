Subject: [T2] worn rings? need advice

well i am a very frustrated bus owner and the thought of water cooled
power in my bus has crossed my mind,
Here's the deal ; my 78 westy with around 7k since top end rebuild ,
including new amc heads, and about 10-15 since new longblock leaks like
a sieve.  the engine runs like a champ , plenty of power, no blue smoke
, etc., i do know that some oil is leaking from my oil temp sender in
the sump plate and this will be remedied at next oil change but i just
started my bus to keep it lubricated while stored for the salt season
and oil was raining down from the engine, no specific source just oil
dripping all over the place, at a show in the fall i discussed oil in my
fan shroud with some people who thought may be the rear seal was shot
and that this was common but now oil is everywhere, i swore to myself
that i would never again pay to rebuild or rebuild myself, another
air-cooled vw engine after the last time i had the top end
professionally done, (after which by the way the engine was tight as a
drum ) it has been suggested to me that poor quality rings may be
resulting in excessive pressure in the case and blowing oil out and that
i should drop the engine and do a ring job or add an oil breather.  what
do you think of this?  if my engine is toast i will not rebuild it i
will either sell my bus and cut my loses or commit an atrocity that i
personally hate and drop either a fox/rabbit or toyota engine in my bus.
I love my bus and have enjoyed all the aircooleds i have driven owned
and tinkered with but this is turning into a rich mans past time as
these cars get older and rarer, I'm hoping for some positive advice or
blind opinions on the problem ( i know email is not the way to diagnose
car trouble but its too cold for me to do anything about it know and i
would like all the input i can get)
poor bus owner who has already spent 12,000 dollars too many
