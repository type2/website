&gt; Legally your only option is probably going to be to accept them paying
&gt; for professional repair, unless they offer you to total it, and you
&gt; agree with their offer. Otherwise, get three estimates from trusted
&gt; shops and don't accept anything less than the best repair. Even when
&gt; done right, a vehicle is never the same after frame damage.

but a bus doesn't have a frame....!
