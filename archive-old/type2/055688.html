Subject: Westy tent waterproofing....

As one of the originators of this thread, I ask... can we please KILL
IT????

I simply said be careful before doing something irreparable to your
tent...(fair advice for ANYTHING, vw or not, IMHO).

Water-proofing a Westy tent...buying a Westy tent...not buying a Westy
tent...buying some cheap tent from the local home-improvement
center.._dot_camping w/out a tent...to trench...not to trench...to not
trench because it is the politically-correct way to live, because in
another 30 years we will all be dead and won't have any forest left
'cause we're all stupid and we over-populate.................


I'm about to take my newly acquired Westy tent into the back yard
and...1-) Water-proof it....2-) let small children and rodents
defecate in/on it...3-) dig a REALLY LARGE AND DEEP TRENCH around
it...4-) during a horrendous rain-storm (caused by el-nino, no doubt)
get myself castrated (doing my part to save the world, y'know)...5-)
burn my tent to the ground as it is a very large parrafin candle (my
castrated self being inside, of course)....


If I sound a little off the deep end, it's only because this thread is
WAY off the deep end!

Can we ALL PLEASE MOVE ON???:-)
