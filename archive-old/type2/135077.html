&gt; I just spent some time in the archives, and, as usual, am now totally

&gt;
&gt; BPR5ES
&gt; BR5ES
&gt; B5ES
&gt;
&gt; R=resistor, when would one not want a resistor plug?

The resistor is already in the rotor, and there is resistance in the 
wires.  I don't think you need/want a resistor plug.

&gt; P=&quot;projected,&quot; what does this mean?

That it sticks out a bit further into the combustion chamber, I think.

I'm installing B6ES plugs in my '76 FI Bus.
