Subject: Re: [T2] Stuck sliding door

Sounds like the roller is hanging up.  Remove the screws holding the cover
on (carefully, you don't want to mess up their mounting) and use a wide
blade putty knife placed under the cover in the crease where the cover is
bent to match the body.  I use my favorite 4 inch taping knife that has a
brass end for hammering and alternate tapping the front and rear of the
cover.

Good luck,
Bill

Subject: [T2] Stuck sliding door


&gt; Hello folks,
&gt;
&gt; My sliding side door ('72 Kombi) opens about 4 inches untill the sliding
&gt; hinge seems to get stuck on itself. It's on the runner O.K. nothings
hanging
&gt; loose. I can't get the cover off so all i can see is from underneath - it
&gt; seems a catch isn't being released..... anyone have any ideas?
&gt;
&gt; Cheers
&gt;
