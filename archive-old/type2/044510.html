Subject: [T2] Price of a 79 Westy and other questions re:79's

I'm looking at a 79 tan Westy that has the usual rust in front of the back
wheels (only on one side) and a minor amount under the windshield, which I
know is more serious. It is all there, seems to be solid with a gas heater
and everything working. The owner is asking 4300 Canadian. It also has a
fridge and the owner says a stove (but I didn't see any propane tank on the
side), can someone tell me about this model year and any diffs it would have
to my 78 I used to own?
Many thanks,
Courtney
