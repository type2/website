Subject: Fuel Filler Necks are Back!

Just a note that I now have bus fuel filler necks back in stock.  This is
the large rubber &quot;elbow&quot; that attaches to the fuel filler opening on the
side of the bus.  Unavailable for several years.

Price is $39.95.  Part number is 211 201 119.  It will be on the website
tomorrow, or you can order by part number toll free at 1-888-819-DEPOT.
