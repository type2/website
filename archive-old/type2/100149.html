Subject: Re: [T2] Re:(2) Valve and Rod job... I think.

Allow me to suggest the following order of operations--
1. Check for anything obviously loose, armatures etc. If you have a 
screen on your fan, check that
2. Check belts and pulleys (you might even take a big adjustable wrench 
and turn the engine over by hand a few times)
3. Check oil
4. Start engine

I always have to remind myself to live by this rule of diagnostics--

Always Rule Out Easy-and-Cheap-to-Fix Causes Before Attempting Major Work

Otherwise I have a tendency to rebuild a carburetor when the cause is a 
cracked vacuum line or pull apart a wheel assembly when the cause is a 
rock wedged in the tire tread.

On the other hand, by following the rule Always Assume the Worst I have 
quickly amassed a surprising collection of tools and parts :-)

&gt; Hi Everyone,
&gt;
&gt; Thanks so much for answering my questions so quickly.
&gt;
&gt; After reading everyone's advise, I think I need to take a deep breath 
&gt; and
&gt; start from the beginning.  Over this next week I am going to start with
&gt; some basics.
&gt;
&gt; 1. Listen to the engine :-).  I was afraid to turn it on when I got 
&gt; home.
&gt; I'm over that now.
&gt; 2. Compression check.
&gt; 3. Check to see if there is any lose parts rattling around.
&gt; 4. Remove the valve covers. Check it out.
