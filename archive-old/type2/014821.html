I know you will hear about the same from other listees, but I have a
Craftsman Welder, but I got the one up from that. I got the kind that has
the Gas. I got it on clearance for $239 and I had to get a gas bottle for
about $95. I love the welder, it gives very smooth welds on the thin steel
that we need to weld. I have seen the gasless and would not go there,
however, if you get one that uses gas and want to try gasless welding all
you need is flux core wire and shut off the gas. I think most welders come
with a spool of flux core when you buy them. You may need to get some
regular wire. I got a small spool of the wire for about $8, it is cheap. I
think by the time you add the extra cost of the better welder and the cost
of the gas bottle you will be talking about $150 more, but well worth it. I
am so glad I went with the gas, not gasless.

Subject:	[T2] Welder opinion

I followed a topic a few weeks ago on welders. I was looking at the
sears gasless 80 amp mig welder. Any opinions on this welder? I have
never seen or used one myself.  It's main purpose will be to replace or
repair a few panels on my bus and for future tinkering. Anyone have one?
