Chad,

&gt;Thus, I seek the collective wisdom of the list:  anyone have a
&gt;recommendation for a shop near Sunnyvale, CA?

I share the same trepidation of having someone else work on my bus, but I 
had to to get it running again after sitting for three years.  The guys 
at the used VW parts junkyard (closed now, sadly) recommended Glenn's 
Garage (and Ministry) off of Blossom Hill.  I towed it down there, and it 
was the right choice.  His garage barely has room for a volksie because 
of all the old parts he can't let go of.  I knew it was the right guy.  
Also, his recommendation was backed up by the folks at Just Bugs when I 
had them do some body work.  Bottom line, if something happened that I 
couldn't get fixed - I would take it back to Glenn.  Here is the info:

GLENNS GARAGE,   
5833 Winfield Blvd # Bl,   San Jose,   95123-2426,   
Tel :408-225-6385. 

I also rely heavily on Peninsula Automotive for parts and they have a 
service department as well.  They are all Volkswagon, all the time, and 
tend to have more bus stuff than Bugformance.

HTH,
