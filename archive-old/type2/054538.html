Mike -

It's always easier to spend $$$ on things when they have a name. That why I
haven't named my 16 year old son yet.

I won't even try to help you name that orange bus (though names like Peel,
Barrel, Crate, Seedless, and Navel come to  mind), but I happen to know a
little website of bus names already used:

http://home.earthlink_dot_net/~visket/Type2/BusNames.htm

Of course, once you name the little beast, let me know what it's name is, so
I can update the list (along with the new 4 or 5 names this thread brought
out of hiding).

Good luck!
