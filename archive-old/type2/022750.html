Chad,

I would think that the swaybars would do nothing but add to the handling capability of your bus (given that they are the correct models &amp; installed correctly).  You also mentioned that one of the ball joints was replaced - I would recommend checking the condition of the other ball joints in your front suspension.  I replaced ball joints on a '74 a few months ago.  The handling was exactly like you described - at times I could barely keep the vehicle in one lane.  After the new ball joints were installed &amp; the front suspension was aligned the difference was night &amp; day.

&amp; yes, as you mentioned, it would probably be good to check the steering play. I don't have the specs for that, though.  List???

good luck.
