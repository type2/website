Subject: RE: [T2] any differences btwn 1978 2.0L Type IV and 1979 2.0L
  Type IV

&gt;From: Harry Hoffman

&gt;Subject line says it all. I've got a chance to buy a used 2.0L from a 78 
&gt;bus. I currently have a 79 bus (calfi. FI).

&gt;Is there anything I should be concerned of in terms of not matching my 
&gt;motor? Heads, case, etc?


Most notable things would be the Exhaust Ports on the heads and the Heat 
Exchangers that match.

79= Square Ports
78= Oval Ports

Take a look around on this site and get all the difference to help you make 
your decision.

Good Luck,
