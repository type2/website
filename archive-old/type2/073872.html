Subject: Re: [T2] 2.0 FI Again

[...]

You started this thread as ''2.0 FI'' but you are also looking for vent windows
for a 74......so I am assuming you have a 74?
74 Calif version buses with an auto trans has FI on the 1800 engine. Is this
what you have? [all other 74 USA buses have 2 carbs]
If you have a 1800, 74 or 75, the temp sensor is not next to #3 intake port. It
is in the top of the head at about a 45 degree angle above #3 and #4 intake
ports. Look at almost any left side upper cylinder tin and you will see a rubber
plug in a 3/4'' hole. That is where the temp sensor goes in on a 1800. Major
PITA to replace!
I have seen people swap heads after a valve job, not realizing that there is a
left and a right....and then have to add a long length of wire to connect the
sensor.
If you have a 2.0, then the sensor goes in the hole in front of #3 intake port.
If you have a tin screw there, remove it. Is the hole 6x1.0? If yes, it is a 1/2
head. You could drill the hole but you need to find a 10 x 1.0 tap. Tap &amp; die
sets come with 10 x 1.25 and 1.50.


&gt; From what I have now heard, I started to look for the
&gt; cly head temp #3 (Temp sensor 2 I assume), but I could
&gt; not find it where the manual states....between the
&gt; intake flange and the spark plug hole of cylinder #3.
&gt; I did however find the wire that I assume should
&gt; connect to it.  I can't for the life of my figure out
&gt; where to hook it up.  The only thing I see that could
&gt; be this sensor is just on the firewall side of the
&gt; distributor, and it is already hooked up (could be
&gt; wrong)
&gt;
&gt; Off on a limb, the PO said that he had a cylinder head
&gt; rebuilt, and when looking throught the #3 spark plug
&gt; hole, I see a very clean cylinder head so I assume
&gt; that's the one.  My question is, when the work was
&gt; done, could they have put different engine tin in and
&gt; forgotten to hook up the sensor?  Just grabbing at
&gt; straws.
