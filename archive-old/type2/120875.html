You really ought to buy yourself a Bentley[*] manual, too.  ISBN 
0-8376-0094-4.

[*] ...the name of the publisher.  Title of the book is &quot;Official 
Service Manual: Station Wagon/Bus 1968, ... 1979&quot;.

The Idiot book is good, but it is really geared towards old bugs, and 
not really much at all towards Busses with Type 4 engines.  It is a 
good read, though, and can provide good background for a lot of tasks.  
But use Bentley as the definitive source of information.
