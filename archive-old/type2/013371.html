Also remember that Berg recommends Compression ratios of not more than 6.6
for 87 octane to 6.9:1 for 91 octane. Original the 1600 had a compression
ratio of 7.3:1, this should be reduced. I would check all of the other
things recommended first and if the light keeps coming on use 91 octane,
and if that doesn't do it take the heads off and put some spacers in there
to lower the compression down to 6.6:1.
