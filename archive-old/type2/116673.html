Subject: VWoA supports AIR cooled community

hey volks, I was on vacation, so if you guys already ran a thread on this 
one I apologize.

but I got a letter today from VWoA,  really nice VW letterhead and envelope.

it was a promotion for the Michigan VW Club annual event which VWoA is 
getting involved with.

IT IS GREAT TO SEE THAT THEY ARE NOW WANTING TO SUPPORT US AND NOT SUE US.

Big cheers to the MVVC and Ernest Otter..........they held a meeting last 
year at their event between VWoA and themselves expressing our outrage at 
how the vintage lovers were being treated.

THANKS AGAIN,
Buddah
