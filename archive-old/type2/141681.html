Subject: Re: [T2] Van sitting for two years, what can I expect?

If it were me I would bring a HD pickup and trailer or tow dolly. 
Has the van been run at all for the past two years, or did they just park it and leave it where it sat? It sounds like it won't start or run now. Has the soon to be PO tried to get it to run and failed, or just put it up for sale without knowing if it actually runs? 
Unless proper storage precautions were taken, the gas tank could be rusted and filled with nasty stuff. Even worse, the entire fuel system could be gunked up as well
How about the tires. If the van has been sitting in the same place, they could be flat spotted. The sidewalls are likely cracked from sun exposure.

If you can get it running when you go to pick it up. you'd be wise to have a shop look at suspension, steering, brakes and tires at the very least. 

Also, even though AAA will get you home, being broken down on the side of the road is a PITA, and breakdowns sometimes happen at the worst possible time and place.
Good luck, let us know how it turns out

I recently bought an 83 Vanagon Adventurewagen, yea!  I bought this van on 
ebay for a great price and can't wait to go pick it up.  It is about 5 hours 
away in NY and the van has been siting for at least 2 YEARS.
 
Heres where I need advice.  Other than my AAA card, all my tools, a new 
battery and replacement fluids and filters, what else should I bring, and don't say a bible.

The seller assured me that the van ran when he parked it two years ago.  
What else should I check and/or replace before I get underway?  If I do 
break down, I can have it towed all the way home with my AAA card... but i 
want to avoid permanant damage on the way, thats my real concern.  When I 
get it home, I will be able to love it and baby it.
 
Thanks ladies and gents, this is a great community.
