X-Diagnostic: MESSAGE MAY NOT BE TOPICAL

Since we are talking about wiper motors, I am currently working in
switching my 6v with a 12v unit in my splittie.Does anyone have  any
experience and/or advice on this?I am stuck without enough clearance to
takeit out. The dash and speaker seem to be in the way. I can't take the
speaker because one of the screws is stuck.Is there away around this?
Thanks,
Cris
