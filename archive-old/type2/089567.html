Subject: Re: [T2] Nada, what a joke

[...]
just finished some checking of vehicles on the nada sight when i saw 
your note.  It appears that on the classic look up zip code is not 
used.  I also would like to know where the values come from.  Two local 
dealers of old VW that i do stuff with both would like to get half of 
some of those prices on their front row vehicles which in some cases a 
fantastic vehicles.  A very clean and well set up 75 westy in fantastic 
condition got $6300 with new brakes tuneup and emissions. a few months 
earlier a consigned 72 in &quot;used condition&quot; but very nice, wouldnt move 
at $2500 with a new engine and a warrentee that went with the engine.

&gt; Just looked up the price of my 74 westy in zip 80110
&gt; Said the low was $6375 and the high is 17,700. I am
&gt; pretty sure I looked it up right, what a joke, I'm
&gt; trying to sell it and would be extremely lucky to get
&gt; $2,000.
&gt; Later,
