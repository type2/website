Subject: Re: Rear Brake Shoes - '73 Bus

Scott, Steve and the List,

There are apparently two different brake shoes that were used on the '72
model (which I have).  When I went to my FLAPS, I needed to know my
chassis number in order to get the right ones.  I didn't have it at the
time and so didn't get the rear shoes.  Check the RMMW catalog.  I
believe they list two different rear shoes for the '72.  If Scott has an
early '73 he may in fact have different shoes than the later model.  I
think '73 through '79 should be the same though.  Ron, Jim??
