Subject: Re: [T2]  Parcel Trays

The knee-busting myth is just a myth. Mine are more out than Gregs (thanks 
Greg - think your photo got me to make my own late last year). Notice the 
tray is BEHIND the steering column and his are ever more behind than mine. 
Im 6 foot and my legs/shins clear my homey ones easily.

As far as safety, in a major front end hit where does the steering column 
go? If safety is such a huge concern for people, not only would I suggest to 
not have any parcel trays, but perhaps they should get a Eurovan with true 
front end collision protection.

Let's just face that VW buses are not safe and especially if the brakes are 
not maintained well and realize we are living on the edge!
