If it was maroon, the guy lives near Buffalo.  HE was at our show about a
month ago.  Guy was really nice, and the interior is pretty mint.  I think I
have a picture or two of it, I'll see if I can find it today and post it.

Being Friday and all, I though I'd ask about a bus my father saw on
the NYS thruway a few weeks ago and told me about.  It is a bay window
with a the top 1/2 of a bug body welded to the roof, facing backwards.
This is the best  I can get from my father so details could be wrong.
It was south of Albany but north of NYC, I'd  guess closer to Albany.

Anybody confirm that my father isn't crazy, and know whose bus this
is? I'd love to see a picture.

On an different note, I wonder if there is a way to link up the
westfalia_dot_org roll call that others have mentioned that list folks who
are willing to provide travelers with various services, with AIRS.
They offer similar services and folks should be aware of both.

Hope y'all have a trouble free trip to and from BBTA. Should be huge
this year.  Bring your electric fans if you have electric hookup.
Last year there was electric hookup, and it will be a hot weekend!
