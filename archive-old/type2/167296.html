  exhaust valve?)

Hi Jamie,

I was thinking the same thing... There's a bus local to me that has a  
flattened lifter. It mushroomed on the cam and can't be pulled out of  
the case. That one had a quarter inch of play in the number 1 intake,  
but also made decent compression.

Jeremiah, what you need to do is to pull the rocker arm on that valve  
and watch the movement of the pushrod as the engine turns over with  
the starter (pull the coil wire so it won't run). If the #4 exhaust  
isn't moving in and out as far as the intake, then you have a cam  
problem. Pull the pushrod and see if you can get the lifter out with  
a magnet. If not, you may have to drop the engine and split the case  
to see what's really happening inside.

Happy Trails,

Greg Potts

&gt; Another thing you could look at... your lifter ,, or cam lobe may  
&gt; be in trouble.. you can pull a lifter and look at the cam lobe very  
&gt; easily.
&gt; If you have a sunken valve,, the valve clearance tightens up.. if  
&gt; you have a flat cam lobe,, the clearance gets bigger...
