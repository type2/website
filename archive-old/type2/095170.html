Subject: Engine Pulling Experience and Questions

Over the weekend I pulled the engine out of my 71 Westy to change out =
the clutch.  Overall it went extremely well, but I ran into a few snags =
that I could use some advice on for the future. =20

The engine came out very easily with a small shop jack.  However the =
tranny dropped as I pulled the engine away and hung down at an angle =
after I seperated the engine and transmission.  This angle made putting =
the engine and gearbox back together again a bit of a hassle and I ended =
up using blocks to raise up the transmission so that the pilot shaft =
would meet up with the engine at the right angle.  In the Idiot book =
Muir suggests simply rolling the bus away from the engine (and back =
toward for installation) but I'm not sure how you can accomplish this =
with the transmission hanging down at an angle. =20

Second, the moustache bar that supports the rear of the engine was in =
the way when trying to reinstall the engine.  Do people remove this and =
the muffler before removing or instaling the engine or do most people =
just keep it all attached and work around it. =20

Third, I had a bear of a time getting the rear tin (the upright piece =
that acts as a firewall) to stay in place against the top of the engine =
and fit in with the rubber seal reinstalling the engine.  I eventuall =
just took it off, reinstalled the engine, and then monkeyed it back into =
place after the engine was installed. =20

Next to last, I dont seem to remember the top surface of the rear apron =
getting hot, but it seems to warm up right next to where the air hoses =
go through.  Can someone tell me if this is normal?

Last, I drained the oil and did added new oil after I was all done.  Now =
the Drain Bolt seems to leak.  Am I supposed to use a new washer each =
time?=20

Thanks to all for their wisdom!  The new clutch is like a magical butter =
clutch!
