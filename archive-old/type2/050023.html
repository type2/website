Subject: [T2] ugly 59 kombi for sale in oregon

I have an ugly 59 kombi sitting in my yard that needs to go away. dents 
scrapes and dings, but nothing to horific there. no glass, no interior, 
missing rear hatch &amp; shift rod, seat divider wall is cut but I can get the m 
code plate(I know where it went and could probably get the wall back for a 
proper 66 wall). this bus was in a building that burned(at the other end, the 
bus was never on fire!!!) and has soot and heat discoloration on it. small 
nut tranny, early front end. CLEAR TITLE.  Fixable but a lot of work. or good 
for parts. no pictures now but will have some in a few days.  $100 or trade 
for a complete dog house flaps and thermostat setup and a full case(24beers) 
of heineken. other trades for items much smaller than a bus considered.
