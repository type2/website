Subject: RE: [T2] read side marker light source?

&gt; i need two side markers for a 72. the rear red ones. 
&gt; Any source for these? w/o photos, i am weary of buying 
&gt; stuff from the bus depot, esp with their ambiguous
&gt; descriptions.  i need the whole shooting match- lens, 
&gt; body, rubber gasket part (and bulb).



They're going to be the same Indian repro's no matter where you buy them, as
there is only one manufacturer. (Other than the fabled Chinese ones from
Empi, which I have yet to see; the last ones I saw from Empi were simply
relabeled Indian ones.) 

This link shows all your options. (How are the descriptions ambiguous,
incidentally? They seem pretty self-explanatory to me, and include pics.
Just wondering.)
