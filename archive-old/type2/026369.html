	Tell me that story scares the excrement out of somebody other than
me!  With the sheer weight of the vehicle over that beam, after the first
look I'd 've parked it.  What's the best way to avoid this in the future?
Powder coating?  POR? Eastwood rust preventative(header coating)?  I'm in
California, but you never know when you might R&amp;R the thing anyway.

  I was backing out of my driveway, a day
after this started, and as I went from the dirt part of my driveway up the
ridge and onto the road, I had my foot gently on the brake pedal as I rolled
out...and as the front tires went up over the little curb to back out onto
the road, I felt the brake pedal come *up* also as the tires rolled over the
curb.
