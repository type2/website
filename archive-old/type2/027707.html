Subject: Re: [T2] Has anyone ever...


I know  it sounds like a good plan to convert a loaf into a camper, but i 
have seen a few conversions,
and almost all have leaking problems and rust problems. Not to mention that 
safety issue,I remember reading when the Westy's were made in Germany they 
actually have different structure changes then
the straight loaf bus's, &gt;then again a vanagon me be made the same as a 
westy vanagon

good luck

&gt;&gt;Hey All,
&gt;Has anyone ever tried to put a bay window camper pop top on a Vanagon?  I 
&gt;have a vanagon with a leaky sunroof, and I really want a camper anyway, so 
&gt;this seem like a good idea to me.  Anyone know if sizes are comparable or 
&gt;if it will be at least &quot;close enough&quot;?
&gt;
&gt;
