Subject: RE: [T2] Stupid question about dealers.

&gt; I'm seeing allot of posts about dealer parts.  Does this mean that
&gt; dealers still stock some of the parts for older VWs?  I can
&gt; actually walk in to my local VW dealership and say &quot;Can you still
&gt; get a rear brake drum for my 1974 VW bus&quot; and not sound like a loon?
&gt; Are there prices stupid high like they are for new car parts or are they
&gt; comparable to a bus-depot


Well, in the example you cited, you would pay $45 from me, or $230.55 from
the dealer.

Basically it depends on the part.  We sell several categories of parts:
1) parts made by an OEM supplier to VW, but sourced directly from the actual
manufacturer rather than from VW. (These are generally comparable to the
dealer part but at a much lower price. The aforementioned brake drum is a
good example.)
2) Parts made by an aftermarket supplier (often because no OEM part is
available anymore; very common with old busses)
3) Genuine VW parts, but purchased somewhere other than from VW of America
(i.e. imported directly from Germany, Brazil, or Mexico). This is often
because the price is much better that way, or because VW of America has
stopped importing it themselves.
4)  Genuine VW parts that we actually do get from VW of America (usually for
lack of any other source).

The last case represents maybe 5% or less of the parts that we sell.  And
only in those cases will the VW dealer's price generally be competitive with
ours.  Even in those cases, our price will typically be lower, but the
shipping cost may eat up part or all of that savings. That depends on what
you are ordering, how much it weighs, etc.

In virtually every other case, you will get a much lower price from a
discount aftermarket supplier such as the Bus Depot. And since we mostly
ship OEM parts (unless OEM parts are either unavailable or very expensive,
in which case you wouldnt have ordered them from the dealer anyway),  the
quality will usually be comparable.

That said, it never hurts to shop around.  Check our website, and also call
your local dealer for a quote.  What do you have to lose?
