Subject: 5-day Oil Change

OR, Why It's Better To Do Your Own Work
OR, Learn From My Mistakes, Newbies

Well, I'm just in from draining my oil for the second time this week.
She's still not on the road, tho.

Sunday: Drained the oil. Couldn't get the old filter off. (Last
oil/filter change was done by local VW mechanics.) Filled 'er up with
20/50, 3 qts. per Bentley (cf. p. 9.10, 6.3 U.S. pints, 2 pints in a
quart last I checked). Checked the oil and couldn't get a reading cuz
the stuff seemed to be creeping up the sides of the dipstick tube.

Monday: I idled her gently (no revving) for about 5 minutes and checked
the oil. Twice as high as the high mark. I don't like this. Opinion of
respected senior members: drain, get that filter offa there, refill.

Tuesday: Borrow strap wrench from co-worker. Pick up oil. Local
all-night KMart didn't have 20/50, so I got 10/40. Oops -- Library says
that's for cooler weather.

Wednesday: (That would be today.) Drained the oil -- looked pretty dark
for just having been changed. Oh, well -- I guess Wendelin will *really*
have that &quot;fresh&quot; feeling after all this is over. Couldn't get the
filter off with the strap. Couldn't get it off with the cheezy plastic
endcap wrench thingy (don't waste your money). Couldn't poke a hole in
the side of the filter to get a screwdriver in (gently, no hammering,
only as a last resort, kids don't try this at home). Called dear friend
and trusted advisor in a fury; he advised taking that left lower tin
off, try the strap wrench again, and give it hell. I did, I did, it came
off -- but not without a fight. The secret: get p!ssed off, then get
totally p!issed off, then just a tad more than that, and you're there.

Important note: The Fram filter I picked up on Sunday is NFG. Doesn't
have a flow valve or something or other in it that the bus needs for
maximum oil pressure efficiency. I musta missed that FART, and didn't
come across the mention in the Library.

So, Wendelin sits with no oil in her and the Fram filter serving as a
cap until I get my Mahle filters that I ordered last week from Bus Depot
and I hie myself on to the FLAPS to get 20/50. Guess I'll save that
10/40 for winter, such as we get here in sunny SoCal.

It really p!sses me off that I have to get so p!ssed off to get stuff
loosened up on my bus. (I went through this process of practically
bursting a blood vessel getting my plugs out -- but the threads are
fine.) My consolation is that I'll only have to do this once -- the
first time -- and after that it's all up to me. But it really seems like
I'm learning this the hard way. Wah.
