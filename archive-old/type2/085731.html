Subject: RE: NEW axle shafts

Ron: What's the quality like on those joints? I know U.S.-made C.V.s are 
generally very good. Are they good and tight like the GKN parts? Also, where 
did the driveshafts come from? Are they cores, Mexican parts, or broomsticks 
painted grey?

Thanks, I'm just curious, I won't need C.V.s for years, but hopefully this 
info will help someone else decide. If the quality is as good as the German 
parts, I would definately go this route. Saves hours.

Thanks,
Mick
