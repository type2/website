Subject: Re: [T2] heater

From: &quot;Greg Potts&quot; &lt;Greg_at_pottsfamily_dot_ca&gt;
&gt; You could replace the squirrel cage fan with a blower but if you're
&gt; only keeping the squirrel cage as a T adapter in the airflow I would
&gt; recommend using something else... the squirrel cage is not designed for
&gt; this and would block a lot more airflow than a proper Y connector.

There's a modification that would probably increase the air flow through the
cage, but I see your point.

&gt; Reheating air from the passenger compartment was stock...
&gt; Sucking cabin air into the heater intake will improve heater output.

I was hoping to avoid breaching the engine compartment, but you've got a
good point.  The BN series all have cutouts into the cabin.  I wonder
exactly where those cutouts are... off to the Library...
