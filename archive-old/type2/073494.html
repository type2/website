&gt;I was really struggling with this whole thread and wasn't quite sure why
&gt;until I read Chris's post.  I don't think I ever get ANY of my vehicles over
&gt;3500 rpm!  I just don't have the personality or stomach for it.  If I were to
&gt;live in a situation (other than the occasional long uphill grade) where this
&gt;kind of driving is frequent and necesary I couldn't take it!!

And there you have it.  Some of us like to rev our engines, and some of us
don't.  There is no need for each of us to be intolerant of the other.  I
myself exhibit both styles depending on the situation - on the way to work
I am often type-A, and when I'm on vacation or just in a lazy mood I'm
type-B.

HOWEVER, I would like to point out that the &quot;shift at 2500rpm, go slow,
don't give-a-damn if anyone likes it&quot; attitude can get you in trouble in
Dallas, especially during rush hour.  A lot of times I have to redline my
bus just to keep up with the normal flow of traffic from a stoplight, and I
almost always redline it when entering the freeway.  That's part of the
game when you're driving a 3800lb, 60hp vehicle.  Doesn't mean I'm stressed
out, or a hot-rodder, or that I am not enjoying the scenery - the freeway
onramp example happens because I am trying to be courteous to the the other
drivers, and not create a safety hazard by trying to merge with 65mph
traffic when I've leisurely accelerated up to 40.

So let's not condemn those who shift at 4500, okay?  They might just love
their busses too.

BTW, I thought I read once that VW's redline for the typeIV bus was
4400rpm.  I almost never rev past this point and I think it is a very sane
redline for this engine.
