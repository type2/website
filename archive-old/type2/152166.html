&gt; &gt; Hey, sorry but after 3 days of parcel traying today I cannot help but tell
&gt; &gt; the list that I don't give a damn about parcel trays. The reason being I do
&gt; &gt; not carry tons of crap in the cabin and the glovebox is enough to keep the
&gt; &gt; front of the bus tidy.

&gt;    But where else can you keep a few quarts of oil handy?
&gt;    BTW, what grade do you prefer... ?-)

I keep a qt of oil between the battery and the tail light assembly on the
right side, a qt of auto tranny fluid on the left side..

Dexron synthetic Mobil 1 tranny fluid
