Subject: VDO Temp Gague

Volks,
  I have a question regarding the VDO Cylinder temp sensor and gague. First
I have a '79 2.0L FI w/CA emissions. I put the heat sensor on my #3 spark
plug. My temp readings are 350 deg with no load doing about 60MPH as I
increase to 70-75 mph the temp goes up to about 425 deg but as soon I slow
down the temp goes down..(thats the good part). My real question is when I
installed the sensor I hooked up the (heat sensor wire) the to wires going
to the gague, but I ran out of wire so I added about 2-3 feet of wire to the
orignal wire that came with the VDO gague. Will adding this wire give me
false readings?? I don't know why it runs hot...the motor is rebulit, new
air box, and runs great. I have all the cooling tin in place, heater hoses
in place. I have been told the motor should not get above 400 espically when
putting a load on it. Any informaion will be greatly appreciated.

Thanks in Advance
