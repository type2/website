Subject: [T2] AVP heads

It seems that I'am back into the same spot I was a few months
back. There is lots of noise coming from the left side cylinder
head. I fairly familiar with the sound of a pounded in valve seat
because it happened already once just a few months back.  I had the machine 
shop put in a new valve seat on the #1 cyl exhaust.
So I'am figuring another seat went as well except its not on the
same head. I took a gamble that these would hold up a bit long but
I was proved wrong. I guess i'll have to bite the bullet and buy
new pair of heads.
By this weekend I hope I'll get the engine back out and have
a look see.

In searching around for new type4 heads with the valve
seat treatment and I only came across AVP.  I searched
around the archive and a few people said that they had gotten
good heads from AVP while others said that they got AMC spanish
rebuilds with spark plug inserts, helicoiled studs, and funny
welds in the exhaust chambers.  Someone said this was because
there weren't many 79'(square port) heads around and so they
just do not have much to work with. I of course need 79' heads.

So what's the deal?
I'am I worrying about nothing and these heads are just fine?
Has anyone else bought type4 heads or 79(square port exhaust)
heads from AVP that could share what they think about them.

-
On a less serious note I had a great vacation to Michigan
and Illinois. A total of about 1,900 miles with no break downs.
Wahoo! I am so happy with the bus ;)  I did lots of camping and
had a wonderful time traveling in my bus. And meet few
interesting people along the way too.


Thanks for any comments
