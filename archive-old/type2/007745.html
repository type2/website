Volks-

I want to say &quot;Goodbye!&quot; to all the wonderful people of these virtual
villages before I disappeared.  

I bought my first Vanagon (1984 Westy) this summer, and I found both the
TypeII and the Vanagon lists to be TREMENDOUS sources of information,
humor, and interesting discussion.

I hate to do this, but I'm deep into a thesis that requires more than
100% of my spare time, AND my Vanagon is running and operating
wonderfully - thanks a great deal to all of you!  I gleaned a great deal
of valuable information here (much of which has been downloaded, printed,
and is kept in a binder in my VW!) these past few months.  I remained on
the list after all of my own questions were answered, hoping to return
the favor by contributing the little bit of knowledge that I have.  I
hope that I have evened-up my Web-Karma.  :-)

I'll rejoin someday (if the administrators allow this), even if I do not
have any questions myself, because I know that I will miss the
interesting discourse that I enjoyed so much.

I'm still looking for a nice late 1970s Westy - possibly as partial trade
for my 1984 Westfalia - if something comes up in the next few months, I
sure appreciate a note.

Thank you, goodbye, and the best to all of you!

Fondly,
Marty, 1984 Westfalia &quot;Heisenberg&quot;
