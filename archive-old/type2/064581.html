Subject: New engine

Hello...

Somewhat related to the discussion that's been going on about parts costs
(re: FS '75 Westie and the pursuant flames, etc.), I have this question:

My '72 Campmobile (Sounder) needs a new engine. My local mechanic (Seattle
area) quoted me $1,700 for a factory rebuild. Plus installation ... so I'm
looking at around $2K. Seemed a little expensive to me. Question: What are
the sources for new engines? Which places have the best quality? Prices? 

Question No. 2: It's a long story, but is an engine from a '73 Westie
compatible with my '72? And if it is, what's preferable: Keeping my Weber
carbs, or keeping the newly rebuilt stock dual carbs that are on this '73
engine.

Thoughts?

'72 Westie
also owned 4 Karmann Ghias, two bugs, etc.
