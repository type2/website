All,

Shortly after buying my Westy (back when I actually had some money) I
ordered the following from BusBoys:

~front and rear Sway-Away sway bars
~VDO tach and bezel
~VDO oil temp, head temp and oil press gauges and the nifty little
mounting plate the sell
~VDO speedo (doesn't fit, but I liked it and still have it)
~Under dash parcel tray (was out of stock and still is, as far as I
know:-(
~replacement faucet for my sink

All of the parts arrived within 4 shipping days. The invoice was
correct and I got a catalog with my order. True, it was a poorly
zeroxed and stapled copy, but it serves it's purpose.

I had no problems with them whatsoever. In fact, I talked to the owner
about various repairs and he was very helpful.

I do get the impression this is a very small and laid-back operation
though. Possibly not too computer oriented either (that may explain
the unfinished web page).

&gt; I sent them $4 for the catalog.  I had two problems:
&gt; 
&gt; 1. it took about 1 month (or more) to arive.  How long would a parts
order
&gt; take?  (it was a xerox of the original catalog, which, I guess, they
ran
&gt; out of).
&gt; 
&gt; 2. the catalog has no prices, no price sheet attached either, so
while it
&gt; has some good pictures and stuff, how am I supposed to know what to
order.   
&gt; 
&gt; So I called and asked for prices on 1 or 2 things I knew the going
rate
&gt; for, and found the prices to be higher than expected.
&gt; 
&gt; So I woundered what I might buy from them?
&gt; 
&gt; They did say the repro side markder lights are $10 lense, base and
bulb,
&gt; which is a good deal, and I guess for the splitties they have a real
cool
&gt; 'safari' front window insert, but other than unique BB parts, why
not go
&gt; with Bus Depot?  I couldn't see the advantage.  I'm sure if you are
local
&gt; to Redding its a great resource.
