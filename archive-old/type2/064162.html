Subject: sticky throttle/carburetor

If I let up on the accelerator pedal quickly, so that the throttle
snaps closed, it is very hard to open it up again.  This is on a brand
new 34PICT-3 (less than a month old).  I've pretty much proven that
the problem is on the carburetor (I can have slack in the cable, and
still have the problem when trying to move the throttle linkage on the
carb by hand).

Ideas?
