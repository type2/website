Subject: [T2] Slow start, Slight Misfire!?!

    OK,,,,Here Goes,,,,
Last week some time I had bought a New cap &amp; roter from a Checkers auto
parts, Called the Next C.A.P.'s store for a New set of points, as the 1'st
store didnt have em in stock. Went out &amp; installed my new points &amp; cap &amp;
roter. (Second time I've done this, to my 1st bus) popped em in &amp; drove to
work, still misses but not as bad. Starts a little quicker. (ONLY 5seconds
on the starter/rather than 20 seconds) Comming home from work started right
up, ran a little sluggish/not as much Get-up-and-go as there used to be. say
about 3 round trips to work &amp; it is harder to start than before I replaced
everything. So I get up a little early thinking maybe the points had slipped
or something!?! Take off the cap, &amp; look inside it, to my avail!!!  The
little Carbon springy thing is NOT even in there. Just Black soot all over.
Woooo-Hooo! Found my problem/ I had cleaned the Old cap up with a Cordless
Dremmel wire brush attachment. the other night &amp; put it in my Emergency box.
So I just put the old cap back on. Checked the point gap. .016. OK! take a
shower get dressed for work. Hop in &amp; grind the starter for the approx 20
sec.'s it has been taking for the last month/The WHOLE reason I started this
adventure. Go to work, still a slight miss when you let her/him/it
(politically correctness/ I hope) just idle. So a day or two later. (still
grinding the starter, for around 15/20 sec's before it'll start) I file the
Old points/ take the pit/mountain tops off the connectors. &amp; pop them in.
Hmmmmmm? Maybe???
    Ugghhh NOT! Still takes the 15/20 seconds on starter. &amp; ALLS I have to
show right now is a new rotor!!!!   Hmmmmm, Maybe???? tommorow I'll put the
old filed cleaned up one back in.
            ANY IDEAS????
The problem summed up in a nut-shell is,
    Hard start. / Good Battery!
    Has a slight miss _at_ idle (in neutral while giving it a little gas[ to
keep the Gen. light from glowing/it dims down when you give it a little gas]
a slight popping from the engine about every 1 &amp; 1/2 seconds.
        When _at_ speed it seems to run fine.



            One more thing, All these acronym's ya'll use???  I.E. &quot;FLAPS&quot;
local area parts store??? Whats the &quot;F&quot;. &quot;Dizzy&quot; distrubuter!  &amp; a bunch of
others I have NO &quot;F&quot;in idea what your talking about!!!   I've been on the
list for about a year &amp; 1/2. &amp; have caght a good majority of these Acro's.
but not ALL.  Could some-one think about putting a &quot;Acronym Dictionary&quot;
out???

            Sorry it was so long, but I just had to get this off my chest!!!
                                          T.I.A.  ( Thank's in Advance / for
those of you who dont know that one)
                                    &quot;Bernie&quot;

&quot;Nuke-Em till they glow&quot;
         So Cleache, But  from a &quot;CT&quot; tech. it makes sense!!!
