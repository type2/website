Subject: Re: Any advice on cleaning Westy curtains?

snip!

&gt; Owner's Supplemental Manual on my 84 Westy says to either Hand Wash or Dry
&gt; Clean them. 

IMHO I prefer hand washing as opposed to dry cleaning, it is  them far less toxic to you (who will end up 
breathing the dry cleaning stuff in) and the earth

&lt;soap box mode off&gt;
