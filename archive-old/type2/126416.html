Heh.

Congratulations from someone who's been at the exact spot you're in! 

When I first got my bus, I seemed to move from frustration to
frustration, with no end in sight. Nearly gave up a few times. Then it
all kinda &quot;clicked&quot;. Now mine is a daily driver, takes me to work
every day.

Everything from here on is just &quot;quality time&quot;. ;-)
