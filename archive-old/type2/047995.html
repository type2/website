Subject: [T2] Z-bed available

Dear All,

I have a new set of Z-bed hardware attached to a 32 year old full-width back
seat from my '68 bus.  I'd like to offer it to anyone on the list.  If
you're near Seattle you can come pick it up, if you are farther away, I'll
take it apart and send you the hardware and instructions, you'll pay the
postage.  This set up lets you shift your regular bench seat into a bed and
back into a seat again with little effort.  I think it fits in all Baywindow
busses, don't know about Vanagons.  I'm looking for picture or diagrams of
cabinetspeople have in Baywindow busses.  I don't want to be a full time
camper, I like hauling plants and animals and etc in my bus, but I want to
have some storage built in too.  I have a full bench front seat, so behind
the wall seems like a good place for a long narrow set of shelves.  All
information gratefully received and TIA.
Jody in Seattle

p.s. My z-bed is available because I just found and installed a full wide
Westy made bench/bed.._dot_can you see my smile ?  It has the greatest storage
box underneath...
