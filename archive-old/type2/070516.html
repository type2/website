I had a Yoko on a bug split at the sidewall with less than 1000 miles
on it. It was clearly a defective tire, and I was able to to convince the
dealer and get it replaced.

I have also had a crescent wrench go into the tread of a Michelin with
less that 200 miles on it. The business end of the crescent wrench was
buried in the tire not the handle.

Sometime weird things happen to tires that you can't beleive unless you
are there.
