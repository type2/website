Subject: Re: [T2] Hard Starting -- Update

Hi Jason,

If it did this after you sprayed all that extra stuff in there, that
would be the normal reaction of the running. Basically if flooded out
and after you revved it up, it burnt off all the extra fuel you
sprayed in.

Probably next step is check strength of spark. If weak see if it is
stronger at the coil than at the plugs. If weak at the coil, then
check battery voltage available at the coil at rest and while
cranking. See if cleaning battery terminals and trans ground strap
increases available voltage. Might run load test on starter too. If
good voltage at coil but coil spark is weak, then new coil is called
for. This assuming points, condensor are good.

John

&gt; BTW, This morning, when I first got it started, it was idling REALLY rough
&gt; (35F air temp), and I revved it up to 3000 once.  After that, it idled
&gt; smoothly.  Also, my ALT light stays on when idling at startup, but goes out
&gt; with a throttle blip above 1200.  Don;t know if it's related, but I figured
&gt; I'd mention it.
