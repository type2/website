&gt;Jan, I would not worry about compromising the &quot;stock-ness&quot;  of the bus.Take
&gt;me for instance, I am getting ready to swap front beams from a 1972
&gt;Westy to my 1970 bus.  This way I have disc brakes.  Think of this as an
&gt;added safety feature.  If you look at the bus you will not really be
&gt;able to notice the change - and hell, as far as I am concerned, it only
&gt;adds to the value of my bus.

I have a different viewpoint regarding this question.  I bought two 1970
Westy's, built three months apart.  One was to be the project, the other a
parts donor.  The bus with the better body was to be the working unit.  It
had the stock 1970 brakes.  The other had retrofitted a 1971 axle beam and
composite drums in the rear.  I had to make a choice, move the disc brake
and wheel assemblies to the other bus or refurbish the stock brakes.  Even
though the disc brakes perform slightly better, I decided not to build a
mongrel.  Even a casual bus watcher recognizes that the older style wheel
with the deep dish hubcaps, (that went with the drum brakes) went all the
way from the splitties to 1970.  Call me crazy but I wanted my 70 to look
like a 70.  A properly working drum system ain't so bad.
