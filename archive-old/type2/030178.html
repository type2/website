&gt; Thing about baseball caps is
&gt; 1) It isn't being done - there are at least 2 people doing t-shirts so why
&gt; cut into there business and lots of people have t-shirts but no-one has an
&gt; AIRS or Type2_dot_com ball cap

Actually, Lynn Sheeley (sp?) does (or has done for years..) type2_dot_com
hats...though I havent seen him at any of the shows lately.

&gt; 3) can't think of 3 now but got to be other advantages of caps over tees

you can wear them every day and no one looks at you wierd.
