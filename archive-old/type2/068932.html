&gt; I'd love to have one of those SP2's but Uncle Sam's (no, not Unca Joel's)
&gt; bureaucratic red tape won't allow it. :&lt;(
&gt; 

Not true whatsoever, there is one for sale on the net,

and I have seen them in mags floating around CA occasionally.
I would hate to know what they want for this though.  I once had
a book listing the SP1 and SP2 performance spec and they were
quite impressive for a VW at the time.
