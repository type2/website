Subject: Re: bench to bucket, etc. [long]

hello,

i have a significant other and we both like bench seat busses better than
walkthroughs... because...

she has a dog, so we have to put a board between the walkthrough on my
bus anyway, and she ends up climbing over the seat to get stuff.  She asys
its no problem at all... i usually have a cooler right behind the
passenger seat so that works as a good step.

the bed is wider on a bench seat bus because you can sleep where the spare
tire would go... with the 2 of us and a dog it gets cramped back there
with a spare tire.

also with a bech seat bus you can share bodily warmth when the heater
doesnt do much to warm the bus up... slide over and wrap up in a sleeping
bag, its quite nice i'd say.

so in summary, i'd much rather have a nonwalkthrough bus than a
walkthrough because its easy enough to climb over the seat, and with a
bench you get a good spare tire well and IMHO its just much cooler :)

so, im hoping my next bus will be nonwalkthrough, but a 68-70
nonwalkthrough is hard to find.  I am also shopping for a splitty, but i
dont see myself not having a 68-70 too.

peas,

Steve

p.s. i am excluding 71 in my search because missouri just instituted awful
strict and expensive emission tests on 71 and newer... UGH!  i missed the
cutoff by 1 year as i have a 71 :(
