Subject: [T2] Re: Inlet manifold boots

Hi Folks,
   A recent post asked    &quot;Can anyone tell me if it is possible to replace 
the two rubber boots on the three section inlet manifold of my camper 
without taking the engine out.&quot;

   A couple of months ago I replaced the intake boots on the 1600DP engine 
in my 71 westy.  I disconnected the acclerator cable, fuel line, choke wire, 
and intake air duct from the carb.  Then I unbolted the left side end piece 
and the preheat pipe on both ends.  I shifted the center section to the 
right a little, then lifted off the left end piece.  Next I removed the left 
side intake boots then shifted the center section to the left and replaced 
the right side boots.  Moved the center section a little to the right and 
installed the left side boots.  Then the job was to put it all back together 
in the reverse order of disassembly using new gaskets as I went.  Just be 
careful that you don't disturb the right end piece.  If you do, you'll need 
a new gasket there too.  Type 4 engines can be done in a similar maner, just 
the details are different.  I think it has taken me longer to type this than 
that whole job did.
   Happy Thanksgiving to everyone in the US.  In fact, let's all be thankful 
for what we have.
