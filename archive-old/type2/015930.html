&gt;Went to Midas the other day to have a complete replacement of my exhaust

My thoughts:

Midas does stand behind their guarantee.  I had Midas mufflers on a 1975
Oldsmobile (2 mufflers, 2 resonators) and over the lifetime of the vehicle
they replaced more than a hundred of these under warranty.  Yes I did say
HUNDRED; once or twice every year I had all four replaced, and I drove that
car for 15 years!  Their mufflers were the cheapest junk you can imagine,
and I rarely had a set last more than six months because all the in-town
driving never got the exhaust hot enough to dry the system out.  I
specifically remember one muffler rusting through in less than 90 days.
Midas always found a way to charge me at least $10-$20 for &quot;pipes&quot; or
&quot;materials&quot; and since those mufflers probably cost them only $2 each to
manufacture in Taiwan, I doubt they lost money on me.

My '72 Westy has been to Midas only once.  They told me they could only
warranty the VW muffler if it were welded onto the manifold.  I got out of
there as quick as I could and have never been back to Midas again.
