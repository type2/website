Subject: 4 to 5 gears gearbox conversion

Hi all,

Im  an owner of a 1972 T2 bus that was purchased
without engine and it has some rust to repair. I
bought a CU 2.0 It carburatered engine and I have a
change to have a 5 speed gearbox from a friends T3. 
Ive no idea the type/number of it, in order to
identify the model/year of the gearbox. 
Nevertheless, it has, I guess, a side gear selector
instead of a regular type 1 front nose. My question is
the following: can I install this type of gear box in
this specific 1972 T2  bus? the engine I know it can
be fitted.
I heard also, that for the regular 4 speed gearbox,
the flywheel should be a Type 1 model. What kind of
modifications it will be subjected, and for a possible
5 speed gearbox with a CU engine what kind of flywheel
can be used?

Thanks in advance 

Louis Albert
