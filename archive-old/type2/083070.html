Subject: Re: [T2] tire/rim size and speedo reading

I always have trouble getting my head around this one (faster 
slower). But just so you know 215/65R15 is within 1% of stock.

Thanks,
Chris

P.S. My GUESS is that since the diameter is smaller than 
stock, the ground covered is less (per revolution at the hub) 
than a stock tire. Therefore your speedometer would indicate 
that you are going FASTER than you really are.

&gt;
&gt;The standard tire/rim size of T-2, as I understand, is 
185/82/R14.   If we use  195/65/15, can anyone please tell 
how far the deviation of Speedo reading would be?   would it 
be faster or slower than the actual speed?
