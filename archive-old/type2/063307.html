&gt;a) on a '77, does it have hydraulic lifters? or do i check the valves?

You check the valves.

&gt;b) will a '74 transaxle (with both cv joints attatched) fit a '77?

I already answered this one.

&gt;c) what kinda dohickey do i need to plug into the 12volt thingy under
&gt;the glove box?

Bradley has one.

&gt;d) what is egr?

Exhaust Gas Recirculation

&gt;e) what kind of cord do i need to hook power up to the van? how safe is it?
&gt;can i run any small apliance off of this?

The Westy came with a cable for this.  It's black and very thick.  Check
under the seat for it.  You can run small appliances with it safely.

&gt;f) i assume 20w50 oil is okay to run on in the summer in a '77? i need to
&gt;change the oil first thing.

Yes, it's okay.  I sometimes run 20-50.

&gt;g) i have ac but it don't work. would it be a smart idea to complete remove
&gt;the ac unit so i have less weight? should i leave it alone?

Less weight is always a good thing, but don't remove it if you think you
may fix it someday.

&gt;h) what other goodies do i have now and not know about? :-)

Fuel injection...
