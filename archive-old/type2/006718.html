Subject: BN-4 questions

I've owned my bus since March and finally got around to rehabbing the
factory/stock heater.  I followed VanNess's article on cleaning, testing,
and fabricating new diaphragms.  I got things in relative order and started
the flow rate test with the graduated cylinder, through the jet.  After
approx 1or 2 minutes the clicking stopped and now I only get a steady
stream.   I emailed Mr. Van Ness saturday but am waiting til monday to give
up on a response from him.  I called Arkady Mirvis in NJ and spoke to him at
length.  Arkady seems to have done a lot of work and research into these
heaters and while his arguments sound valid, I cannot afford the $300+ it
would cost to have him rehab the thing for me or sell me the metering fuel
pump he says is the ONLY safe way to use the old model BN4.  
my question is do any of ya'll have suggtions for what's wrong with my
pressure regulator?  is there some sort of valve set up with which I could
regulate the flow ?  Is there a fusable link or fuse in the system that I
don't see?  is the regulator solenoid shot and are there replacements?  I
want a valid, safe fix that will cost me low $?  any assistance will be
appreciated.  It's cold gang. 
thanks
