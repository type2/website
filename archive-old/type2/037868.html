Subject: ideas to keep the bus

Volks,
  I have a question, how or what can I do to prevent my bus from being
stolen. I am in the process of restoring the bus and I dont want to have it
stolen like Cynthia. Would the club work, hidden kill switch?? Any ideas or
methods will be greatly appreciated.

Thanks in Advance

Brad
'79 bus (almost restored)
San Deigo.

PS I will keep my eye for her bus, I even think I have seen it before.
