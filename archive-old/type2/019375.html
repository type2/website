Mickey,
Since you statically timed the car, that may be why you're having
problems with the engine running at certain rpms.  I would definately
get that checked out asap.

In regards to the blinking light, are you sure the connections are
good?  You may be hitting a resonant frequency of some old connection
causing it to be intermittent.

Hope that helps a little..
Mike

&gt; Hello,
&gt; 
&gt; I took a small road trip this past weekend to test the 77 2L engine that I
&gt; recently installed into my 75 westy. After about 90-100 miles I noticed
&gt; some hesitation and the flashing of the oil light. I stopped at a service
&gt; station to check it out. The oil level was a little low. I have noticed a
&gt; leak that only happens when the engine is running for a while. I added 1/2
&gt; quart of oil, and let it sit shut down to cool off although it was not
&gt; excessively hot. I ran it another 5 or 10 miles and it did the same thing
&gt; hesitation and flashing light. The light would flash only when reaching a
&gt; certain RPM. We towed it home and today I did a compression test. 100 in
&gt; cylinders 1,3,and 4 105 in cylinder 2. Muir says that this light flashing
&gt; at high idle means overhaul time but how can I need an overhaul with Good
&gt; compression in all cylinders. The timing is definetely not perfect I've
&gt; only done it statically. My next step is to check the point gap with a
&gt; tach dwell meter and do the timing with a strobe light. My instincts tell
&gt; me however that this problem is not due to imperfect timing adjustment.
&gt; does anyone have any advice. Please be gentle.
&gt; There is an exhaust leak for sure as i stuffed a shirt in the tailpipe and
&gt; it did very little and as I mentioned a pretty good oil leak when hot.
&gt; coming from the rear of the  engine.
