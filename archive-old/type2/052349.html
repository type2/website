===========================&gt;
The part # is 211 611 833C.
There are two of them used.
One under the bottle.
One at the master cylinder reservoir inlet nipple.

I am going to order some for stock.
Casper will act up on the same part eventually, now that he knows NewBus 
got attention by misbehaving.

To get me going, AR (my cousin, trained by the same people that trains the 
astronauts) and I took a small piece of 3/8&quot; rubber tubing and reamed out 
the inside using a drill bit, all the while, slowly turning the tubing by hand.

We then took some rough paper and decreased the OD of the tubing so as to 
make it quite thin.

Slipped the finished product onto the master cylinder reservoir inlet 
nipple, clamped with the special clamp, and  ............... success !!
