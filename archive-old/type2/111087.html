Subject: Re: [T2] It's running hot and I don't know why?

I have not checked the oil pressure on my 80 2.0 L
engine but the temp normaly runs between 180 and 230
depending on the temp outside and the load on the
engine, this may  be normal. Phil 

the oil temp went past 180f. and the oil
&gt; pressure began to 
&gt; slowly decrease from 40 psi _at_ 180f to 30 psi _at_ 190f 
&gt; to about 20 psi _at_ 
&gt; 200f
