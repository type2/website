Subject: Need to borrow Tow Hitch

VWonderful So. Cal. San Fernando Valley Folks -

Does anyone close have a bus ('69) towbar they are willing to rent out for 
next Tuesday (June 22)? I just need to tow my bus 2 miles, and really don't 
want to charge one of my 100 mile tows from Triple-A.

Thanks -

Mike
