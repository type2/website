&gt; &gt; Oh, the bus in question is a 1978 westfalia,  2L engine......

&gt;hmmmm, I have a used head that is servicable that he can have, but I'm in
&gt;Baltimore MD how to get it to him in a reasonable time that is the
&gt;question, head was removed from my 78 2liter bus, valve is sinking
&gt;slightly but should be good for a few k miles...

Get a   length of 3/8&quot; nylon rope...

Rent a valve spring compressor that goes under the rocker arm stud at local 
Autozone or similar.  Remove the spark plug and turn the engine so the 
piston is down in the cylinder.  Tie a knot in the end of the rope and feed 
the other end into the spark plug hole - the knot is so you don't lose the 
whole thing!

When you have a bunch of rope in there, turn the engine back so the piston 
presses on the rope, and the rope presses on the valve...then you can use 
the spring compressor on the valve to replace the missing spring without 
dismantling the engine...
