Sorry Paul, that is really steep for my pockets, I was looking in the under 
$10.00 range, the bus is for sale and it would have been nice to have the A/C 
working. The compressor has what looks to be some sort of bracket on the side 
of it, but I don't see how to hook it up or adjust the belt once it's on. I 
already have the tin for the compressor set aside and have a regular tin on 
for now to close the gap for cooling. Thank you anyway for the offer.

Max
