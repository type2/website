Subject: 12V Interior Fans Final Results

Thanks to everyone who provided input.
I went to  West Marine and they are having a 25% off sale on all fans.
The most  expensive were the $89.99 German Hella Marine fans!

I bought a fan that  sits on the dashboard and oscillates for $17.04 
including CA sales tax.
It  works fine and comes with double sided sticky tape to hold it in place 
and runs  of the cigar lighter.

I will post pictures when I do my next website  upgrade.
 
I went for a drive on the freeway and the fan is a little bit  noisy when 
still, but it makes way less noise than the AC on full blast. Turn on  the fan 
and the cool air blows on your face, not the back of your neck!  It  is great 
and I wish that I had done it some time ago. 
 
Now I can drive in comfort to Jerome through the  desert!
