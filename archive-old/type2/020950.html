&gt; Since the subject of canvas has come up...has anyone tried to cut/sew their
&gt; own replacement canvas? My '77 needs new canvas, and I've been thinking about
&gt; trying to make my own. I've found a local fabric store that will order the
&gt; material, but my wife has just a plain 'ol Singer sewing machine that she
&gt; says I will most likely burn up trying to sew it all together. The current
&gt; canvas (which I believe to be original) isn't really that heavy of a
&gt; material. If you look at it, it's really only 4 panels sewn together. The
&gt; hardest part I see would be the front panel with the screen and the zippered
&gt; flap. Just curious!  Hey, come to think of it, if I'm successful I may have a
&gt; new business. I always heard Dawn had more than she could handle.      Jeff S.

There are Singers and there are Singers and Singers. (At least 3 different levels
of ruggedness.)
Genuine upholstery  sewing machines would obviously be the best to do day in day
out work on canvas. Years ago my wife bought a GEAR DRIVE straight stitch Singer,
a school model. This is one tough Singer. We have a local store that sells these
things and I think they are about $50. You could probably call up a good service
place and find out if your wife's machine had metal gears. The guys that fix them
know if it would be up to it. When the time comes, my wife will be able to do
ours, no problem. She loves to do curtains and has made a couple of custom sets
over the years.
