This is almost assuredly a blown fuse, then.

Those are separate circuits (actually, there is no fuse for the
starter at all).  Given the plethora of fuse box layouts, I can't tell
you which one precisely to check.  So, pull each of them in turn, and
verify that they are good with an ohmmeter.  What will often happen is
that it'll look fine while it's in the holder, but the wire'll crumble
into several pieces when you remove it.  If that doesn't happen, then
the meter can tell you for sure.  To avoid mixing up which goes where,
only check one fuse at a time.

If that's not it, then it's time to chase wires around under the dash
with the voltmeter.  This is something to avoid if you can....
