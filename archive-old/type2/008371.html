ola,

	i just bought a 71 westy and was just wondering about some things.  i'm
pretty new to the whole vw thing so any help would be appreciated.  first
off, does the 71 have any know problems with it ?  also, should i be
changing anything right away ?  someone told me i should change all the
fuel lines immediately which i thought made sense, anything else ?  is
anybody on this list from the vancouver, b.c. area ?  does anybody on this
list know of any sweet-ass vw repair shops/ parts yards in the vancouver
area ?  thanks for any help.  adios everybody !
