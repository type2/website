Subject: RE: Coil, EGR Filter or None of the Above?

&gt;===== Original Message From &quot;Sami Dakhlia&quot; &lt;dakhlia_at_simplecom_dot_net&gt; =====
&gt;Hey Kevin,
&gt;
&gt;The EGR filter is not in the engine compartment, but underneath, on the left
&gt;hand side, just above the valve cover.

Okay, that I didn't know, so I checked underneath.

&gt; If it's not there, then it fell off and chances are that your engine is 
sucking in &gt;fresh air through the hole (not a good thing, as lean running 
causes overheating).

The hole to the engine compartment it plugged and there is a plate and gasket 
plugging/blocking entry to the muffler.

&gt;This theory is also consistent with the symptoms you describe: the engine
&gt;stalling when too lean. This may not as much a problem on the cold engine
&gt;because the open aux. bypass valve acts on the AFM to provide a lightly 
richer &gt;mixture.


&gt;Sami

Does the fact that both ends are plugged alter or effect the theory?  Should I 
buy the filter and the arms that connect?
