Subject: Steering wheel / ignition lock

Hey guys,

     I received my new ignition wiring from Bus Boys and I'm really happy with it. I realized though, that my ignition key is almost ready to break (only have one). I am going to order a new lock cyl, and it raised a couple of questions. I have to remove my steering wheel to get that component out that says &quot;Goverdomma, sliding door... etc...&quot; or something in German. It's also the component that holds the ignition lock and the wiring. 

I'd like to take it off so I can paint it and replace everything with more ease. Do you guys know where I can get a NEW sticker, and also... my horn button / steering wheel cap is cracked... do I have other options other than the standard black one? Can I put the Wolfsburg steering wheel cap on there?


Thanks!!!

Todd
