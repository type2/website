&gt; me pump to almost five psi with constant pumping....  I don't know what
&gt; that means.  The bus stops fine.  I'd like to know how to test the

&gt; vacuum leak...

Dave,

At idle, hook up a vacuum gauge to any manifold vacuum port (if you have
FI, the nipple between the intake runners for cylinders #1 &amp; 2 is good and
handy)  check the vacuum.  Is it over 15&quot;? (15&quot; is at the ragged edge of
acceptable, 17-19&quot; is better, over 19&quot; and your timing is probably too
advanced)  Unplug and cork the booster line, check vacuum again... did it
go up?  If it did, you have a problem and will overheat the engine if you
drive it very far.  If there was no difference, then plug your booster
back in.  Idle the bus and have someone step on the brakes while you watch
the gauge.  The reading should drop a bit, then come right back up.  If it
does, then your booster is fine.  Turn the bus off, wait 10 seconds and
step on the brakes three times.  You should have boost the first time
definitely, the second time probably and almost certainly not the third
time.  If you *don't* have boost the first time, then your one-way valve
is toast and should be replaced.
