Subject: Re: [T2] Transmission

Hiya Mike,

This is certainly not a definitive answer to your question but 
FWIW...............  

One of my first VW-related projects back in the sixties was building a 
fiberglass bodied dune buggy from a shortened VW pan and transaxle.  I used a 
Crown conversion kit so I could mate up a Corvair engine with the VW 
transaxle.  As part of that kit Crown supplied berylium (I'm pretty sure that 
was the stuff) washers to be installed in the tranny.  These were provided in 
order to take the extra &quot;sock&quot; of the horsepower/torque of the Corvair six 
cylinder.
