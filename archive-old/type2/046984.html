Subject: Re: [T2] Converting 69 Westy to electric refridgerator

[...]

Interesting question.

Supposedly the ice box [not the cabinet, just the innards] is a US product,
like much of the other Westfalia bits.

If so, it may be a standard size unit.

If THAT's true, there just might be a US RV fridge that would fit neatly
into the Westy cabinet.

Alternatively, has anyone ever checked to see if a later bus reefer could be
fitted into the early bus Westy sink/cooler cabinet?

&gt;&gt;  I'm thinking about converting my 69 Westy's cooler to an electric
refridgerator powered by a 2nd battery/alternator.    Anyone attempt this
conversion before?  &lt;&lt;
