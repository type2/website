Subject: Re: [T2] Did Westfalia do Hightops?

Westfalia never made a high top camper.

This bus appears to have been owned by someone who was pretty handy and had
access to some parts buses. The hightop is from an Adventurewagen and the
rear deck and side trim are a part of the Adventurewagen trim (notice the
darker wood). The z-bed looks like an SO-69 full width bed and I see there
is a spice rack (from the fridge) hanging on the wall. Some of the other
components on the walls appear to have been fabricated from Westy
cabinets...however I am not as familiar with the splitty interiors and the
little cushion cabinet appears to be Westfalia, but I have never seen one in
a Baywindow before. Interesting camper. Looks like someone took a lot of
time to make it functional for them, although it's not original. The propane
tank is pretty neat, appears to be an RV portal, as this isn't in my
Adventurewagen brochure. If you are interested in this bus I would check for
rust behind the propane tank.

Purists beware: I simply love the idea of putting the dining table on the
rear cabinet like this bus has. I hate the placement of the table in the
late (76-79) Westies, laying on the rear cushion. Whenever you go camping
the bed won't expand with the table or leg in the way, and there is no place
to put it if you are sleeping, so I usually leave it at home. I am going
outside now to look at this idea!
