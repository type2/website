&gt;     I'd think that perl is already integral to the server, most
&gt;webservers are totally dependant upon it. Most unix systems come with it
&gt;out of the box.
&gt;

     Probably, 'cept I know Ken likes Macs, so there's an off chance 
we're running on MacOS, which would require loading MacPerl, and no doubt 
some annoying tweaking of the Faq-O-Matic code to adapt to MacOS. OTOH, I 
also know Ken's been poking about quite a bit with Linux over the last 
few years, which would nicely solve that problem... Frankly, I expect 
that we're on some variant of unix, but I'll wait on confirmation from 
Ken. Also, that doesn't eliminate the bandwidth issue-since perl is 
relatively demanding we may not have the available resources on our poor 
overworked server...  ;-)
