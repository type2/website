Subject: Re: [T2] Re: [VB] Any lawyers???

I cant imagine mileage being a factor on a vehicle as old as a bus,
pre-existing condition yes, if you've got a rust bucket dont try to stretch
the truth by saying rust &quot;free&quot;
and I can see the ins co wanting some documentation as to what had been done
to maintain it, but we're talkin body work here.

&gt; I was not going to keep this thread going, but Joel and then Brian's
&gt; comments changed my mind.
&gt;
&gt; I bought the FauVeh with 160k miles, put in a new engine, took great care
of
&gt; it, and drove 70k miles. Then some moron answering his cell phone
rear-ends
&gt; me.
&gt;
&gt; It turns out we both have Triple A insurance so they send me to 3 approved
&gt; body shops, the first of which asks about the mileage (ie is that 132k or
&gt; 232k). I answered 232k and got an estimate so low that it wouldn't cover
&gt; replacing the chrome bumper.
&gt;
&gt; Second approved body shop just assumed 132k and sent AAA an estimate that
&gt; &quot;fixed&quot; all the damage done by the above said moron. But even repaired my
&gt; bus is still not the same as before the accident (and never will be).
&gt;
&gt; I have been paying premiums to AAA for 10+ years with no claims so I don't
&gt; think my &quot;flexible scruples&quot; raised anyone's insurance premiums. Besides I
&gt; think Joel's suggestion of &quot;show the estimates to the insurance company &amp;
&gt; threaten to sue&quot; have more of a negative impact on rates.
&gt;
&gt; Nuff said, Renate
&gt;
&gt; p.s. Renate is a female name (at least if you are born in Austria)

&gt;
&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;I did not leap in to volunteer the correct number (232,000). Not
&gt; &gt;totally honest, but made a big difference in the end.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;p.s. Sorry if I offended any list members with my flexible scruples.&lt;&lt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;i am not personally offended. its your decision &amp; if you can live with
it,
&gt; &gt;then do so.  however, my wallet is offended.  situations like this are
just
&gt; &gt;one of the reasons that insurance rates are so high. &amp; i'm not saying
that
&gt; &gt;just to flame someone, either. i've been through similar situations &amp;
felt
&gt; &gt;that i had to add my .02 on this thread.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; This fortunate misreading of the mileage in this case just saved
&gt; everyone time, money and aggravation. The outcome was that the
&gt; owner of this Bus got what he was entitled to: reimbursement of
&gt; the damage sustained in an accident that is covered by an insurance
&gt; company.
&gt;
&gt; I just moved to the US and picked my Bus up in Baltimore. It needed to
&gt; be insured so we added it as a second vehicle to my girlfriends
&gt; insurance, for now. I am very suprised to see that I'm only insured
&gt; for 15K here and 15K there, it's like driving around with no insurance
&gt; at all. The standard car insurance in Holland, or the countries around
&gt; it, is something like, $2.500.000 maximum per case. 15K doesn't even
&gt; cover a few weeks in hospital. The strangest thing is that this 15K
&gt; liabillity insurance costs me twice as much as what I had in Holland,
&gt; where my Bus was also covered 'all risks' to the estimated value of
&gt; around 15K (at todays exchange rate). Insuring a 15K risk should not
&gt; cost more than $30 a months or so. The insurance companies can collect
&gt; a lot of premiums and hand out 15K here and there, great way to do
&gt; business...
&gt;
&gt; Needless to say, I'm worried about someone running into my Bus in
&gt; some way. Isn't it so, that if it is values by an approved company,
&gt; to a certain value, that the insurance has to treat it as if it
&gt; was a 1999 car with a certain &quot;blue book&quot; value? I would greatly
&gt; appreciate any info on how to insure a Bus in the US, in such a way
&gt; I won't be paying someone's wheel chair the rest of my life (fingers
&gt; crossed), or loose my investment in case some uninsured driver runs
&gt; into it.
&gt;
&gt; All that said, there is no way an insurance company could -really-
&gt; 'undo' the damage to my Bus, it would just never be the same.
&gt;
&gt; Brian.
