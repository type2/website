I could hear the fan, I could hear clicking, ( the spark plug firing?), and
I could feel the fuel pump working, but no ignition. I found that the air
intake hose had come loose from the pipe and the opening of the hose was
flush against the engine tin.  Outside this hose had gathered ice,
effectively sealing the hose end against the tin. No air, no ignition!
