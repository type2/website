Subject: Re: [T2] Source for vacuum leak discovered, Was Re: [T2] Low
  vacuum ..

Hi Tom:


&gt; Are you sure about this?  I once completely disassembled an EGR valve from
&gt; my '81 and, as I remember, there *is* a &quot;rubber&quot; seal inside the EGR.

You are correct that the EGR valve does also have a rubber seal that goes around
the valve shaft. Its main function is to keep exhaust from leaking out of the
valve when it is closed. From the exhaust chamber (see picture below). Exhaust
pressure and the spring pressure keep exhaust from entering the air distributor.

However this seal is not the primary seal when we consider things from the air
distributor's point of view. The first seal the vacuum sees (when the valve is
closed) is the metal to metal seal. If this seal is in bad shape then the valve
will leak.

When we plug the EGR valve (leaving it on air distributor), then the condition
of this secondary rubber seal is also important.

|  seal    |     chamber  |  seal      |
=====================|


&gt;  That setup made sense to me because there's no way to really make a
&gt; metal-to-metal seal on a part that's supposed to move.  I always figured if I
&gt; could find a source for this seal that I could re-hab most EGR's.

The rubber seal is important as well as the mating surface inside the main body
of the EGR valve for it to function properly. The VW EGR valve meters the amount
of exhaust going into the engine. It is closed at idle and also closed at full
throttle. It has two sealing surfaces on each side. Both are metal to metal
seals. Each surface has to be in great shape to seal well. Rusty/deteriorated,
poor tolerance between the movable part of the valve and the sealing surface and
we have a bad EGR valve.

|  seal    |     chamber  |  seal    |   |
=====================|  |

To retrofit an EGR valve, one would need to replace the rubber seal, and
re-machine the metal sealing surfaces. My guess is that a new EGR body is used,
as if this is machined, then the inside movable portion of the valve would no
longer fit tightly. The movable portion is stainless and thus could probably be
reused.

Initially I had thought about rehabbing mine and reusing it as my rubber still
has some life in it. I can clean up the main metal seal, but the secondary
surface (for sealing when the valve is all the way open) is too pitted to seal
anymore. I figure I will clean the valve up, test the amount of vacuum the valve
will hold and sell it to someone who needs to have what looks to be a working
valve to pass emissions. As I want to have my system working to cool the
cylinders and to avoid detonation, I am going to buy a professionally
reconditioned valve.


&gt; Are you saying there's another seal that fits where the shaft that moves the
&gt; butterfly valve passes throught the throttle body itself?
&gt;
&gt; I went downstairs and looked closely at the throttle body I have out of my
&gt; '82 and there *does* appear to be a O-ring sort of thingy sitting around the
&gt; shaft next to the throttle body itself, though it's hard to see, since I
&gt; haven't cleaned this throttle body yet.  Is this what you're talking about?
&gt;

Yes there is a shaft seal (similar to a main shaft seal) that goes around the
throttle body butterfly valve shaft. I could see air leaking from this location
when I immersed and pressurized my setup. It is a major source of vacuum leak.


&gt; Back in the days when I was messing around with Bug-eyed Sprites the SU
&gt; carbs on these things used to wear where the butterfly shaft passed through
&gt; the body of the carb.  The only permanent fix was to bush the carb body
&gt; itself, though people used to &quot;get by&quot; by using O-rings and sealer.

Now what to do about it? I will have to go through the seal catalogs/vendors to
see if Ic an find something similar. There is a part number on it, but I will
have to disassemble my throttle body first. Anyone know if Bosch made a rebuild
kit for throttle bodies?

There is also an O-ring around the idle adjustment screw. I image that also
should be replaced as it is 20 years old.
