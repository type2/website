&gt; &gt; wondering if there are any buses/vanagons with two sliding doors? Anybody
&gt; &gt; seen one (or two)?

&gt; &gt;       Karl.

I had a 76 double sliding door Bus,
 It had an upright T1 engine with the T1-T4 factory tin conversion also, It had
retracting seat belts and km only speedo. and the headlights were H4 style with
a small tertiary lamp installed in the headlight,, connected to the ignition to
operate like todays daytime headlights

Well.. you might not want to read on,, it is not for the weak of heart!
I sold it to a &quot;young&quot; fellow, in the discussion I tried to ensure that it was
going to be used and maintained which was his intention,  After a few
weeks/months and a fair bit of rocker and dogleg work,, along with alot of brake
work and general maintenance, he had a rocker arm fail. It broke in half. I
never seen that before
This led to him selling to another young fellow, who took it home, and got &quot;GET
THAT OUT OF THE DRIVEWAY NOW!&quot; response from his father!
So,,,, It was taken to a local scrap yard, where they shoved the forkes of the
loader thru the drivers side sliding door to unload it from the truck.
By the time I got wind of this,,they had also stripped the engine and trans, and
set it in the pile. 
Still reading? My 74 Westy now has retracting seat belts, a km only dash and
daytime driving H4 style headlights
I took pictures, but they arn't worth posting, the drivers side looks like the
image is flipped of the passenger side,, as you can't see the steering wheel..
you have to look real close to see the wipers park on the passenger side
