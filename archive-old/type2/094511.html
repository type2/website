Subject: Re: [T2] taillamps

Working for PEP boys these items are tops on two lists.  one is the 
theft list, and the other is the returns list.  Not a recommended buy 
item.

&gt; i saw some 1157 taillamps with brake and running lights in the same 
&gt; bulb except made from led's, has anyone any experience with these and 
&gt; would they be applicable to our busses as it seems all the old 
&gt; assemblies are turning to dust after 30 od years of heat from the 
&gt; running lamps.
