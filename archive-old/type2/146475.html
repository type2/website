Subject: Re: [T2] It didnt start!

Chris,

First, I just happen to have a very heavy duty Ford style relay
sitting around on my work bench.  Left over from another project that
I managed never to finish.  Do you happen to have a write up on this
procedure?

Second, Where is the Westy?

thanks,
David

&gt;The starter solenoid is just being it's normal 30 year old self. You
&gt;might want to experiment with the starter relay/hot start relay idea.
&gt;Requires a relay, some wire, and some connectors. I've used a Ford
&gt;starter relay because Muir said to and I already owned one at the
&gt;time, but I will admit now that it is prob overkill. A regular relay
&gt;ala radio Shack 30 AMP Bosch copy would prob work just a well for $6
&gt;or so. FWIW I never had a hot start problem after that. Have had many
&gt;episodes with VWs that act that way. My Beetle that i had in Italy
&gt;('72 Super with a 1200cc engine) did this often and sometimes in cool
&gt;weather after a run on the Autostrada. Relay fixed it.

&gt;'78 Westy 2,7L
&gt;Cookeville
&gt;
&gt;P.S. noticed a local inop '78 Westy was vandalized by someone. Broken
&gt;out all the glass. Bus is good and 95% complete. Is a Westy. Has a/c.
&gt;Wish somebody would rescue it. I can't. Contact me for further
&gt;details. Bus is not mine but I could put you in contact with the
&gt;owners.
