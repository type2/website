Subject: Re: 77 FI no start

&gt;&gt;   I have a 77 bus that won't start. The bus was running fine and it
just wouldn't start all of a sudden. I have looked at it and it seems
the ignition is working properly although the bus won't fire at all.
I have checked the double relay the resistor block above it and the
fuel pump is working. In looking at it it seems that the injectors
are not receiving the ground signal which tells them to open. &lt;&lt;
If ignition is ok but bus won't start AND fuel pump is working - is that an
auditory check or fuel presure test?  I'd make sure there's pressure in the
ring main.  The fuel pump comes on with the starter running and sending
current from term 50 to 88y  on the double relay, but to stay running, it
needs power from the (+) term on coil going thru double relay (t86c), whose
relay sends (+) current from t88z to all of the FI system except what's
needed when just starter runs.  This includes power to the pump switch in
the AFM from the  flap staying open from engine vacuum and allowing the
current to flow to t86b and to same relay that keeps pump on!

Are the injectors getting their constant 12 volts?
 The injectors get a constant 12 volts from the resistor block, which gets
its current from term. 88b of double relay, which also depends on the
ignition coil (+) giving current to t86c.
  The grounding is supplied by the brain, which gets signals via the points
to coil- trace that extra wire that joins the condensor wire at the
negative coil terminal as being continuous to terminal 1 of the &quot;brain&quot;.  I
assume the condensor/distr. is OK, based on you saying ignition is OK?
Once can pull a pair of injectors and watch to see that they spray when you
turn over starter (ign on but coil tower wire pulled).

Re loose wires-I'd have to follow a wiring diagram- note that the Bentley
view of the harness shows the colors and type of connector, which you don't
mention.  The ordinary push on wires (brown) are ground.  I'd check also if
you are connected to the microswitch (elimininated in 77), aux air reg.,
thermotime switch and cold start valve.
