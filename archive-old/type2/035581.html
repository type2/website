Subject: Westy roof mildew

Hi,
Anybody have experience with mould and mildew forming on westy roofs. I am
speaking of the later fuzzy ceilings. I have some mould stains and I am
trying to figure out how to either clean it so that it looks more
presentable or remove the fuzzy stuff altogether. I understand that the fuzz
was put there to prevent drips from forming on the ceiling but collecting
moisture and improper drying has led to stains. Any experiences out there
that I could benefit from. Bob
