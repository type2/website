Subject: Re: Found: '57 DD Walkthru

If anyone wants details on this beaut, I'll be happy to provide directions
off-list. If I got it, it would have to sit in a storage shed for 2-3
years, rusting even more. If you're in Northeastern Oklahoma, it's worth
checking out. There are several other buses here, including a couple
splitties in much better shape.

Thanks! Joe

&gt; Roadtripped into Oklahoma to look for the above yesterday...and found it.
&gt; Bob, was that you I passed?
&gt; 
&gt; It's got a lot of rust, but if I had a trailer and the burning desire to own
&gt; a '57 panel, I'd go for it. Well, okay, I have the desire. I just don't have
&gt; the trailer and the time. It was reported to be a '56 to me. I got the VIN
&gt; number, though:  315429.
&gt; 
&gt; It was apparently bus number 221 for 1957, since the numbers start at
&gt; 315209. Pretty low number and a little coincidental since it's a type 21.
&gt; - - - 
&gt; my numbers show the bus as a jan of 58 production
&gt; 
&gt; So now for the obligatory question: Just how rare would a '57 DD Walkthru
&gt; be? 
&gt; - - - 
&gt; pretty rare to find early walk throughs (62 and earlier).   a double door
&gt; panel early walk through is rarer.   ive seen one- a  Jeff Slater is
&gt; restoring it.   a stamped bumper walk though DD panel is rarer.   
&gt; 
&gt; What could you get for one in excellent condition (a range would be
&gt; fine)? The guy's reputed to be asking $700 for this one, but I wouldn't pay
&gt; that much and I'm almost positive that cash could talk him down. 
&gt; - - - - - 
&gt; does it have the correct front and rear bumpers- the thin ones with the
&gt; raised bits and no overriders?    does it have a decklid with no hump above
&gt; the liscense plate place.?   does it have the drivers seat  - those frames
&gt; are hard to find,  does it have the round glass taiillights?    does it have
&gt; windows in the doors(it shouldn't) . rust in tthe sub floors?  sounds like a
&gt; nice project if you like the bus
&gt; 
&gt;  Whoever
&gt; attempts to restore this will have to put several thousand into it to get it
&gt; right...and lots of sweat equity. Front and back windows (that's all except
&gt; the doors) are missing; engine lid missing. pretty straight body, but lots
&gt; of surface rust and some rocker damage. Bound to be damage inside, but it
&gt; was grown over and I had the kids with me. For a better-condition bus I'd
&gt; have done some more investigation, but this one is beyond my current skill
&gt; level
&gt; - -  oh, never mind then.....
