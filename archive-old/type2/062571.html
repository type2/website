all,

...
&gt;
&gt;I've heard that Das Bulli Haus is pretty good for panels (at least for
&gt;splitties). I'm not sure of how well they handle loafs. Check 'em out
&gt;though:

me too they sell panels made by alan schofield in england and as far as I
know the best panels out there. I bet Thom F. could offer some opinions.

Thom's page does have a link to das bulli haus.
