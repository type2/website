Folks....

Just another reminder...Next Saturday, August 8, Rustic Drive-in,
Smithfield, RI. The annual VW van (other VWs invited as well) list and
LiMBO nite at the Drive-in will be held at the Rustic Drive-in starting
around 7 pm.

The Rustic is located about 1 mile north of the intersection of I-295 and
Rt. 146 in Smithfield, RI (about 20 minutes north of Providence RI) easily
reached from Boston or places south via I 95.

The Rustic has three screens and it is possible (bring an additional radio)
to park facing one screen showing a movie for the kiddies, and place a lawn
chair out behind the van and watch some adult (not XXX) fare...the Rustic
broadcasts the audio portion of the movie on AM and FM.

Unfortunately, the Rustic does not announce its next batch of movies until
Thursday...so I'll post the line up on Friday morning. If you can't wait
for the list, here's the Rustic number:

401-769-7601


Hope to see you there!

Ric
