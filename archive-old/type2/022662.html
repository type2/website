I know when I did the research on my 69 and 70 westies the M-code on the 69 
had a code which said &quot;chrome instead of painted parts&quot; , it was code 181. 
Also seen some brochures for 70 westies in which the hubcaps looked gray 
(know more when my mint brochure shows up). Great site for M-codes is Vincent 
Molenaar's which I belive is in the archives
have fun
