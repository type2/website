Subject: Painting The Pop Top

Hello,
    I'm sorry for the second question.  My pop top is
looking kind of dirty.  I've tried scrbbing with no
luck-it's deep inside the fiberglass.  If I were to
paint it, would it look bad if I were to brush it on
nicely since it's such pourous material.  I was
thinking not, but would hate to find out the hard way.
 Does anyone have any suggestions?  Thanks a lot.

Tim
