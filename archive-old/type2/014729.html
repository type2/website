X-Diagnostic: MESSAGE MAY NOT BE TOPICAL

On our Air Force C141bs, we have smoke detectors that use a small light
bulb, when the smoke passes by the light it reflects the light into a sensor
triggering an alarm. This could also be done in a Bus. Or, because the
engine compartment is always dark, a simple light sensor would &quot;see&quot; the
fire(gives off light), and trigger an alarm. 
For a crash, you can pull the inertia sensor out of any newer car and
install it into a Bus. Wire it into your electric fuel pump, stock or
aftermarket(remember, 75-79 have FI pumps and no shut off). These reset, I
have had to reset them several times. Most are in the trunk. 
None of this will replace the need for good fuel lines, secure carb
fittings, and clean wiring(no open frayed wires). Do not put fuel filters
right over the top of a Distributor, your just asking for trouble. Those
things are made in China or Brazil or where ever, do not trust them, put
them under the bus so if they leak you won't spray gas on a hot engine or a
spark source(Dizzy). Also, put it under the tank and it will only see
atmospheric pressure(gravity feed), after the pump, it sees pump pressure. 
Always use hose clamps and proper hose size and type.
Most of all, be safe. It sucks to loose a Bus, but they can be replaced. A
human life can not, how much are your passengers worth?
