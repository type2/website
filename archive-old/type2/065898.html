Subject: Brakes on 71 Westy

Hello,

Ok I replaced the last brake hose and bled the brakes.  I can

find no obvious leaks but I continually have to pump the brakes

to build up a firm pedal which only lasts for a few seconds,

maybe 10 or so.  I checked to make sure all the bleed screws

were tight which they are and looked again for leaks, still

none.  Any idea why the pedal wont stay firm?  I have to admit

changing those lines helped at least a hundred percent, it

actually seems to stop well if I pump furiously. :)
