&gt;&gt;i got kicked outta my house, so my list activity will probably drop drastically...BTW-any insights on living in a bus longterm?&lt;&lt;

Hey Matt,
I'll make you a deal, you come stay at my place and take care of my 2 kids and take the trash out every night for my wife, and I'll live long-term in the bus! OK?!?!  But seriously, enjoy the ride as much as you can, if you've got the means to do some traveling, what better time to do it? I'll bet you that just from this list you could find a way to travel cross country, see the sites, and not spend a cent on hotels or campgrounds.  If you're ever in Southwestern Ohio, you can certainly camp at my place!  Also, if you don't already know how, why not learn to play the guitar, or other instrument, you won't have TV and the like to distract you. 
Also check around at a bunch of campgrounds.  It is the time of the year when they are usually scrambling to find staff, and you can often live at the campground while you're working there.  When I was in College I was resident manager of a campground and got a free place to stay plus $200 bucks a week, which was pretty righteous bucks for a 19 year old in 1988! Good luck and I'm serious about the offer for camping.


Peace, John Baker
