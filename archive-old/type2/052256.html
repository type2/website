Subject: [T2] speaking of sliding doors

my door operates fairly smoothly...a bit of lube and it's fine.

but....when the door is full open, the mechanism that &quot;locks&quot; the door 
open, doesn't release when i want to shut the door.  i have to push the 
mechanism with a screwdriver.

any thoughts?
