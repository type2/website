Subject: Re: [T2] #3 cyl not pulling its weight



&gt; contributing to the engine's power.  When I pulled the spark plug wire
off,
&gt; the rpms did not change, whereas doing this for the other cyllinders slows
&gt; it down and makes it rough.  Engine does not run rough when the other
three

Did you do the &quot;pull the plug wire&quot; test at idle or at a higher RPM?  It has
been my experience that on some engines you cannot tell a difference at idle
but at a higher RPM it is obvious.  Is the bus running badly?
