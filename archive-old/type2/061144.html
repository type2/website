Subject: Re: Retractable Seatbelts for Buses (Gen

I mounted a retractable vanagon belt on the driver side of my 78 Westy,; as
I recall, I took off the angled that turns the belt housing 90 degrees
sideways, and bolted the housing  directly to the wall behind the Driver
seat, as low as it would go and right against the door moulding.  Had to
drill an extra hole for the pointing pin on the housing that presumably
keeps it from pivoting.    When I feel ambitions, I may mount the opposite
one on that little triangle of metal on the door post behind the swivel seat.
   BTW, I added a lap belt on each side of the swivel seat when it faces
rearwards; put the baby seat there back in 86 for our daughter, and it can
be used for regular passengers also.
