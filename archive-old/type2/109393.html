Subject: Quick Question about Steering Wheel Action

Hello All,
I consciously acknowledged something with my 79 bus that I had been merely
&quot;noticing&quot; (and avoiding) over the past several months:  free play in my
steering wheel.  When I turn it in either direction, it seems to travel
loosely (a few inches maybe?) before I feel the pull of the wheels turning.
I observed this condition while parked, and couldn't gauge it as well while
moving - although the looseness is still palpable.  This seems odd as my
steering has always been real tight after replacing the steering box a few
years ago.  Anyway, does this brief description raise any quick flags with
anyone as to what might be the likely cause(s) of this?  Thanks for your
help!

Travis
