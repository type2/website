Richard,

Good point....however.  on my AVP engine in the Champagne edition, I have 
never been totally satisfied with the power....especially compared to the 
old engine that had 134,000 miles on it before being replaced.

My opinion is that the AVP folks run the compression on their engines 
waaaay down so as to keep the head temps down....and longetivity up!

My head temps have never been much above 350(and we know about the cht
gauges), even in 100 degree temps at 75+mph on the interstate....sustained 
driving.

The cht set I used was the same one that i used when i ran the tests 
against the good meter in the oven.

So, I wonder what kind of compression ratio that George ended up with?

Cheers, dave

  - this is a fresh clean rebuild, stock except the cam
  Hence, given the above, why I am mystified, and why I am reverting to the
  stock cam.

  But how many miles were on those heads? What do you know about them?
