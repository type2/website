&lt;&lt; IOW, I don't think Emerson Electric paid very much to use the name on the
Home Depot tools. Besides, the Ridgid stuff is the same bad line Sears sold
for many years, until they decided to seek Taiwanese machinery. (Weird thing
is, the Taiwanese stuff Sears has now is better than the American machines
they used to carry.) &gt;&gt;

IOW, start stocking up on Ridgid plumbing equipment before quality con-
trol heads South (or East ?-) to catch up with the woodworking stuff ??
What was that line about bad driving out good?
