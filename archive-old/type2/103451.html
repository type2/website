Subject: Re: [T2] turn signal switch retaining screws specs. needed

From: &quot;Rik&quot; &lt;nisse_at_attbi_dot_com&gt;
&gt; Apparently, some time in the past few weeks, unknown TERRORISTS have
&gt; removed and made off with the two screws that retain the turn signal
switch
&gt; into its assembly--on my 1970 Westy???

Same guys must have hit Giacomo before he became ours.  The turn signal arm
hangs loosely in the switch socket.  Definitely busticated. :O(

Afterwards, the culprits absquatulated into the darkness...
