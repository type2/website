Subject: Re: [T2] RMMW Catalog

I had to resort to some kind people on teh vintagvw and the type2 list
sending me one!!! Obviously they don't like us Canadians, even though my
wife spent a couple hundred dollars there last year!!
Courtney

&gt; Has anyone had any luck getting a RMMW catalog? I've used their web form,
&gt; called them and still nothing.
