&gt; I talked with an air cooled mechanic (mostly Porsche and a few Beetles in

&gt; What IS the desired reading I should expect him to dial in my '78 Federal FI
&gt; stick Westy ??

I posted some of this information a few weeks back but it's not in the
archives yet and gone from the reflector. Look for the &quot;Calif Smog Issues&quot;
thread on 27 Oct 2004.

One note about tuning with an on-board unit is you can tune for cruise to
optimize your mileage and head temps. L-Jet isn't very tunable other than
rotating the internals of the AFM which is not dealer approved.

For example if you set the %CO to 1.1 at idle at light cruise the %CO may go
way past zero (14.7 AFR and above).

The setting I've been using since my smog test two years ago produced these
results (back then I benched 2.5% after 1500rpm and 3.5% after 2500rpm):

Cold start: 10% CO

Warm idle: 3.5% CO
Light throttle: 0% CO
1/2 throttle: 2.4% CO
WOT: 5.1% CO

The enrichment phase during a cold start is interesting to watch. I measured
the pulse width of the injectors a few weeks ago and it's approximately
double (gulp gulp).

When I turned the AFM screw out one more turn (leaner) the results were:

Warm idle: 1.6% CO
Light throttle: 0% CO
1/2 throttle: 0.7% CO (that's what I measured)
WOT: 4.8% CO

Two turns out from the original setting:

Warm idle: 0.3% CO
Light throttle: 0% CO
1/2 throttle: 2.7% CO
WOT: 4.3% CO

These last settings are very close to John Connelly's recommended settings
for FI. IIRC, the engine sounded rough when warming up on a cold morning. I
would shoot for those settings but by only adjusting the idle mixture in the
shop you won't know for sure because my AFM spring may not be the same. I
haven't messed with it but there's plenty of issues wrt the spring tension
if you search the archives.

When I took those readings I hadn't built my CHT measuring setup yet. I'll
have head temps to go with those settings in a little while.
