In California, at the moment, its 1973 and older vehicles.

Currently your, 1975 will be exempt from smog requirements in 2004
the California is trying to sponsor a bill that would eliminate that 
&quot;rolling exemption&quot;
I tried doing some research on the state site to find the current status of 
the bill and have been unable to do so.
 From the CA EPA site

       Currently, there are several types of vehicles that are exempt from
       Smog Check: motorcycles, diesel-powered vehicles, all 1973 and older
       vehicles, vehicles four model-years old and newer, as well as 
non-combustion
       engine vehicles. SB 42 (Kopp), enacted in 1997 (Chapter 801), exempted
       1966-1973 vehicles from the Smog Check program and created the 30-year
       rolling exemption that will take effect in 2003. The 30-year rolling 
exemption
       will exempt post-1973 vehicles from Smog Check when each model year
       becomes 30 years old. Thus, in 2003, vehicle model year 1974 will be 
exempt.
       In 2004, vehicle model year 1975 will be exempt, and so on. Prior to 
SB 42,
       only pre-1966 vehicles were exempted from the program.

This can be read in its entirety at
http://www_dot_calepa_dot_ca_dot_gov/Legislation/2001/SB1172.htm
I can't find any references other than at the Cal Epa site.

Check out this link to see if your vehicle needs a smog check
http://165.235.17.9/StdPage.asp?Body=/Smogcheck/doineed.htm

Right now it does, but says nothing about 2004

I'll keep looking but for now it looks like the rolling exemption kicks 
starts in 2003.
Also of interest is SB800 which provides a 25 year old exemption for 
collector vehicles as long as a statement is provided from the insurance 
company that the vehicle is insured as a collector car.
