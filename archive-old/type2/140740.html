Subject: Re: [T2] Air Conditioning for your bus - NO HP hog

&quot;Furthermore, the product would free drivers from Freon - which despite
improvements, remains an ozone-depleting chemical in current
air-conditioners. &quot;

Uh someone need to tell these guys, or at least the reporter that doesn't
know any better, that they aren't going to save people from using freon in
their cars! Their gizmo isn't going to get retrofitted to old cars in mass
and new cars haven't used freon for many years.

I also like how they make it sound like they accomplished what GM engineers
said couldn't be done. Yea way back in 1964! LOL

&quot;Today, the young inventors say, U.S. drivers use about 7.9 billion gallons
of fuel each year to run their air-conditioners, which draw power from the
engine. By adopting their contraption - which taps into the electrical
system, using fans to blow hot air through five Peltier chips and then
releasing cold air - they say the country stands to save 3.9 billion gallons
of fuel annually, or about $10 billion based on current gas prices.&quot;

So alternators don't draw power from the engine? You've still got to run
fans + peltier chips in quantities high enough to cool a baking car, I think
that will take a lot of electrical juice...

Anyway they seem to think its twice as efficient as a R-12 Freon auto air
conditioner.
