I bought a 77 camper conversion for $170, and it looks and ran about that
well.  I've done a careful and apparently successful rebuild on the engine
and the interior is weathered, but still functional.  The DPO did lots of
really half assed bodywork on it, putting pounds of bondo on raised metal
surfaces that had been pulled out too far by a slide hammer.  Then sprayed
primer all over just about everything, including lots of surface rust,
which has all come back through.  So its body looks like hell.  I don't
really want it to look all that nice, since I want to be able to use it
and loan it out to people with out worrying, but I think I've got to have
it a little better that it is.  I had originally though I would just get
some spray cans of red and spray the primered areas and be done with it.  
Then I decided to maybe have a body shop spray it after I fooled with the
body work awhile. So how much to spend?  Its always the question.  I think
less than 500 for sure, so I'm really only looking at cheepo chain stores,
like Macco, 1-Day and Earl Scheib, I would also go to Mexico (25 miles
south of me) if a single person would tell me they had good luck with
Mexician paint jobs.  I liked the 1-Day which I went by (San Diego, by
805), didn't like the Macco, and haven't yet gone to the Earl Scheib,
since I regard them as the very bottom of the bucket.  Does anyone have
thoughts?  Is 1-Day basically just Earl Scheib by a different name? Should
I get 1-Day's more expensive paint?  Naturally the suggest it is better,
but how to know?  Advice which involves spending less than $500 is
helpful, including saying to spend nothing.  BTW I do not have access to
air compressor or paint sprayer, and really don't have the spare time to
do it either, what with typing all these emails and what-not...
