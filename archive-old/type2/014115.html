Subject: crankshaft pulley sheared off



I recently bought a '71 camper van with a '70 engine.
My first VW, so I have to claim broad ignorance
regarding the many things that can go wrong. After
doing some maintenance =97 new starter and ignition
switch, new plugs, points and cap, timing, valve
adjustment, oil change, pipes and muffler =97 I enjoyed
about 2000 miles with what seemed to me an engine that
was running well, with enough power to hold  speed at
60, even up some fairly sizable hills. This happy
state lasted until this week, when I loaded up my
family and drove across Wisconsin. On day two of this
trip, after driving about two hours, the generator
light came on. I pulled over, looked under the van,
and saw a steady stream of oil flowing from a point
near where the engine meets the transmission. (Though
who knows where the oil was actually coming from.)
Then when I opened the engine compartment, I saw that
the crankshaft pulley had sheared off the bolt,
leaving a doughnut-shaped piece of steel attached to
the belt. I still have to find a way to get the van
back to St. Paul, and so have not had a chance to do
an autopsy. Does anyone have an opinion on what went
wrong here? I'm willing to accept the blame for having
done something dumb. That being said, I'm still having
trouble figuring why the pulley sheared off its
mounting bolt. Thanks.
