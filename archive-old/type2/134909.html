Subject: Re: [T2] 69 ignition cylinder

I have already cut a key by code.  It didn't work, but just because it 
didn't work, doesn't mean it is bad.  It is very likely it has already been 
rekeyed.  I just needed to know if the present key was needed to rekey the 
cylinder..

Thanks for the offer of the cylinder but that would still lead to the same 
problem I am trying to fix.  We are going for a one key bus.

Looks like I will try impressioning a key and then see if I can take it 
apart once I have that.  If anyone knows how to take apart the cylinder 
without the present key, please let me know.
