Hi Dean, 

Do you have the Berg catalog and manuals? With the rebuild 
coming up it would be nice to have them around. In there you 
can find good and proven info on oil pumps and filtering. 

Berg found that there are not many after market pumps that fit 
the case very well, none maybe. The problem lies where the 
in and outlet holes of the pump meet the case, the pump has 
to be made of the proper alloy and to exact tolerances to keep 
a good seal there, having a good seal is important for both the 
inlet and outlet of the pump. Another thing to consider is that, 
in most Busses with a rear engine support, you couldn't even 
mount a, for instance, Bugpack filterpump, the engine brace 
is in the way. The Berg 30mm pump with their cover with built-in 
relief and outlet -barely- cleared the stock engine support 
on my (European) '74 model with type 1 engine. I had to shim
the engine support about 1mm away from the engine case. The 
pre '72 engine supports are different in design. Another point 
Berg made was that there is no proper way to take the oil from 
the pump, and put it back in there. He feels that the passages 
would have to be too small to allow proper flow. Not all exhaust 
systems clear a filterpump. The Berg pump and or pump cover 
seems the best possible choice to me, along with tapping the 
case for a return fitting. As for filtering on the suction side of the 
pump, I think it is much safer to run without any filter at all. I did 
have a problem getting the threads in the oil lines leak free, after 
I tried about everything a colleague suggested the green Loctite 
(studloc), it cured the problem completely, I was really amazed 
by it.

Good luck with the rebuild!

Brian
