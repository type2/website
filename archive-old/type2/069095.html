Subject: The Beam, Part 3, The Moving of the Bus

AFter the show ended last night, dad got home, and we drove the bus up on 
the dolly. In the coold rain too!

0oh!! an addendum to part two:

After we got hom e witht he trailor, there was a car stoped at the stop 
sign, right near the appartment. It didnt seam to be moving, and it was 
raining and getting dark, and the lights were off.. no brake lights either.
i make the off the wall comment of &quot;hmm..looks like somebody died!&quot; no 
being very serious.

The only place we can park the truck with the dolly on at the moment is 
around the corner. So, we park, then get out..we walk back toward the 
apartment, &lt;and coincidently near the car&gt;, and see the man who works at 
the grocery store accross the street kncoking on the window..i make the 
comment again, &quot;it looks like someone DID die&quot; undermy breath.

Anyway, its a Chrysler somthingoranother, with an elderly black male 
behind hte wheel. engine running, car in park, almost obstructiong 
traffic, but there was enough room sqeeze cars by on its right..
both doors are locked. man from the grocery says that a custamer said 
there was a car with a man slumped down behind the wheel outside, so he 
come out to investigate. when we arrived, he tok off to the phone to call 
911..thye send the cops, and an ambulance..

We could tell he was breathing, but he seemed to be having small seizures..

cops arrive about 8 minutes later&lt;!&gt; and ambulance about 5 minutes after 
that &lt;!!&gt;, and after asking what had happened, etcetc, they check to see 
that the doors are lockeed...didnt believe us or something..:)

so, by now we have 5 cop cars, and about 7 cops. one of whom is 
female...she is instructed to get the nightstick, and bust the right rear 
quarter window...we all tell her it has to be hit hard..&lt;she seems a bit 
of a ditz&gt;, and of course she was also instructed to be careful.

So, after tapping it a bit , one of the othe cops syas &quot;here!&quot; and with 
one pop, the window shatters &lt;man still hassent awoken duing all this.&gt;

short cop tryes to reach in and unlock the front door &lt;2 dr car..labaron 
i think..&gt; then is handed a &quot;recently recovered&quot; tire iron. he attempts 
to hit the lock button with that. No luck. Tall cop then trys and gets it 
quickly. the open both doors, and 5 cops pile into this car around th 
man, and shake him and he awakens..smelling strongly of scotch..

anyway, by this time, we went back up to the apartment..he is then put in 
the while minivan, marked &quot;police&quot; instead of the ambulance..

a cop sits thee behind hte car for about 2 hrs waiting for the hook._dot_car 
is gone now..

back to the story!!

so, we load up the bus, and the toosl, and head on out._dot_decide to turn 
the parking lights on on the bus, for saftls sake..and yeah, we knew it 
would kill th battery!:(

get to harissonville, no real problems.. except cold..:)

then have to push the bus off the dolly since the battery is dead:( 

put battery on charger, and go to bed.

Wake up, and move the ol's out of the garage&lt;just had the oil changed..&gt;

battery back in the bus, and CAREFUKLY drive bus into garage. we clear 
the doorway by about 1 inch.
 once inside, the garage door opener will have to be removed before we 
can lis thte bus, and even then, will only have 1.5 ft before we hit the 
ceiling! and eith aobut 2 feet in th back before the door, and 2.5 ft in 
the front beofre the wall!!!

and the other side of the garage is even shorter!!
at least its heated..


anyhow, so, after we strike the set this afternood, i can begin...


oh well......david
