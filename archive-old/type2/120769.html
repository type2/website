Subject: chain saw blade oil undercoating

I've been reading the archives in reference to undercoating.  It seems 
the oil based method has been talked about quite a lot.  Others have 
suggest this to me as well.

I will soon have in my possession a bus, which I very concerned about 
protecting from rust.  This method seems logical.  On the farm growing 
up, oily areas on tractors and other implements became coated with a 
layer of oil and dirt, but once scraped clean, showed no signs of rust 
and the paint seemed to be perfect.

Does anyone else have input or experiences with this method.  It seems 
cheap enough.  My only concern is the caked on oil and dirt.  Will this 
come clean with a good pressure washing?

Thanks in advance.
