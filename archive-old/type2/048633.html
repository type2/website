Subject: [T2] alt use for 68+ dash vents?

I just bought a pair of Blau ODc10 tweeters for my 68 Westy.

They will mount in the door panels just fine but I was thinking they will create a better stereo image mounted in the dash.  Where to put them?  They are the perfect diameter to mount in the dash vents.  I use the windows for fresh air anyway, so is there a good reason not to do this?
