Subject: Re: [T2] Starter problem

walt-
do you think that even a perfectly good starter/solenoid
could swell from heat to the point that the pull- in winding
cannot overcome the resistance of metal-to-metal contact ?

there are at least two sides to the theory of lubricating the
solenoid plunger, and up here in the frozen dead of winter
we experience a similar condition of no-start, which i
believe is the reduced battery capacity ( cold cranking amps
at 0 degrees farenheit ) gedzundheit ! excuse me...

i am a believer in the starter relay fix which uses the existing
circuitry for signal only, and provides a larger diameter wire for
the power path . i have even resorted to a jumper wire from the
isolated secondary battery to provide additional amperage .

the next time your starter fails, try the screwdriver method of
solenoid activation and ponder the elimination of  current draw
through those tiny contacts in the ignition switch electrical portion
( have you ever seen the internals ? ) .
