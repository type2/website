Subject: ROAD TRIP!!!!!!!

After ten years without a vacation, a soon to be wed daughter gives an 
excuse.

At the end of June, Lisa and I are heading from Union, Oregon to 
Diamond, Ohio to give away the bride on July 3. The journey will take us 
through: Idaho, Utah, Wyoming, Nebraska, Iowa, Indiana, Illinois, and 
most all of Ohio. With any luck we'll try to continue on through 
Pennsylvania and Maryland to DC so I can at last see the Smithsonian. 
(I've been east exactly once. In 1978. Broke down in Roxboro, NC. Didn't 
make the Smithsonian.... Did make an acquaintance that I still talk 
about though.)

We've gathered the complete AIRS listings of the aforementioned states 
but really hope to only make social calls.

We'll be driving the Orphan, an '82 Diesel Westy, thoughtfully provided 
by Britt Grannis.

So... If you see a white V'gon Westy in your part of the world, please 
flag us down.
