&lt;&lt; Hello,
Does any one happen to know the best place to get a Bently, I had rather have 
the older one with the color diagram. [see below]  If I can't find one of 
those I will go get a new one, but with the purchase of my *new* 69 I would 
like to have that book that EVERYONE swears is the best!  Any help would be 
greatly appreciated... 
SEE YOU AT EVERYBUS!
Peace,
Jaime &gt;&gt;

Best site for new and used books:
&lt;www.addall_dot_com&gt;
They search through hundreds of other sites and report back with
lowest (including shipping) prices...The used book search is almost
worth paying for...But it's free so try it.
