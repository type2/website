&gt; A early bus and a bus with a suitcase engine are two different animals.

what are you calling a &quot;suitcase&quot; engine, the type IV??

I've pulled a lot of VW engines in the past 35 years, but my type IV
engine in my 78 with auto tranny, I have a special jack I made for lifting
and lowering and have an auto tranny which is easier to remove. and I
still in a hurry  (wires  are already marked and the fuel lines have
shutoffs)need about 3 hours to do a clean job.   give yourself a full day
for your first pull take your time and get a clean pull without
endangering yourself or your engine, type IV engines are about twice as
heavy as a type I.

good luck

&gt; When you know what you are doing, and when the bolts involved are clean
&gt; and easy to remove, the whole pull-job can take less than 30 minutes.
&gt; We used to pull the engines in our Beetles in under 20 minutes. One
&gt; friend removing wires and cables, me removing the bolts and nuts.
&gt; Then we'd pull the engine - allowing it to fall about 1/2&quot; onto wooden
&gt; blocks and then 3 of us would push the car up on two wheels and roll it
&gt; forward.
&gt; Installation wasn't as slick - requiring jacks and such.
&gt; The bus pull is easy, can be done alone, but I would suggest the help of
&gt; a friend.
&gt; Earlier models are easier than late models.
&gt; Which model is yours?
&gt; The short version is: jack under the engine, disconnect the wiring,
&gt; disconnect the heater cables, disconnect the throttle, disconnect the
&gt; fuel line, remove 4 bolts/nuts on the transmission to engine joint.
&gt; If yours is an early model you can remove the bumper and apron and
&gt; simply roll the van forward leaving the engine behind sitting on blocks.
&gt; If yours is a late, it will require more maneuvering to get the engine
&gt; out as you cannot get the bumper and apron off of these models.
&gt; Your solutions are: Buy Muir's Idiot book (very good basic explanations)
&gt; and a MUST have (even before Muir) is the Bentley book, skip the Haynes
&gt; book. A visit from a VW experienced friend or a visit to a local
&gt; mechanic to watch a VW engine pull.
&gt; P-mail me if you need or want any more clarification.
&gt; My thrust bearing is also making noises and slipping so it would be good
&gt; to do
&gt; that at the same time, any ideas or suggestions would be greatly
&gt; appreciated.
&gt; thanks in advance
&gt; Your thrust bearing may be howling but it is not slipping like a clutch.
&gt; I had a van which ate 3 quickly because one of the arms had weakened and
&gt; that allowed the bearing to get off center. They'd last about 5 miles.
&gt; Another possibility is that the throw-out bearing arm is drifting left
&gt; or right and doing the same damage.
