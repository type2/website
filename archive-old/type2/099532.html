&gt;It's already happened with BMW motorcycles.  Check out
&gt;http://www.ase-motorsport_dot_com/.
&gt;
&gt;Unfortunately, the same isn't really feasable with automobiles, as they
&gt;have to meet safety and emission standards, even if imported as &quot;kits&quot;.
&gt;
&gt;Malcolm Bricklin is currently working on a deal to import ZMW vehicles
&gt;from what was Yugoslavia.  See:

&gt;
&gt;Automobiles.  Yugoslavia.  I can hardly wait  :?

Dunno about the Chinese bikes first hand but I lust after the Ural 
motorcycles with sidecars. They are Russian copies of WWII BMW motorcycles. 
The quality was rather poor with bad bearings, bad castings, etc.

They took alot of rework to make them reliable and durable. The ones 
offered now are quite good I've heard.

Beware of a Chinese motorcycle or scooter - they are not the same as a 
Japanese bike, will require more attention. I've never bought a Chinese 
power tool equal in quality to the American quality tools or European 
tools. I'm not talking about wrenches. I do have 15 chinese wrenches that 
have been pretty good. The screwdrivers are another story!!! &lt;grin&gt;
