Subject: Fuel Line Ratings

Hey,

I was going to replace the fuel lines on my 2.0 FI 76. Everything I read says
to be sure to use the &quot;high-pressure&quot; hose. Unfortunately, I'm not sure if my
local supplier's interpretation of &quot;high-pressure&quot; is the same.

Does anyone know an actual PSI rating I need to look for?

Thanks,

Mike
