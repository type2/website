Subject: Road Trip to pick up Joe's '68

Hey!

As many of you know, I have agreed to purchase Joe's 1968 Deluxe.  I have
set aside Saturday the 12th to make the 295 mile trip from Minneapolis to
Cedar Rapids, IA to get the Bus.

If anyone spots an A1 Rental Cargo Van pulling a Burgundy Bus between Cedar
Rapids, IA and Minneapolis, I am the one at the wheel with white knuckles
but a very big grin on my face.  I have never towed a bus before so this
should be an adventure!

Is there anyone in the Minneapolis area that is willing to help me put in a
headliner and all the windows before mother nature visits in for the winter?

Thanks to all, will let you know how the road trip goes.

- John
