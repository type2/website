Subject: The Ya'll Come Christmas Campout (Final post)

The Ya'll Come Christmas Campout will occur on December 10, 11, and 12,
1999 at the Little Olcmugee State Park just outside McRae, Georgia.  McRae
is situtated in southeat Georgia.

The fee for camping is $15.00 per night + the park pass, and we can put two
campers per site.  We will have electric hook-ups and water at each site.
I am bringing my sidetent and some tarpage to provide a day shelter in case
it rains, or is really cold which I doubt.

I have checked with the park service and they have told me that they do not
expect to be full that weekend, but for those of you that don't like even a
slight gamble I would suggest you call the Georgia state Parks Service at 1
800 864-7275.  The lady I spoke with explained that this time of year is
fairly quiet in the park and unless they recieve an onslaught of campers by
surprise, there should be plenty of sites available.

South Georgia is beautiful this time of year.  The trees are still in color
since all the leaves have not fallen yet.  There is a lake, so I am going
to bring a boat (or two) and some dry gear so anyone thats wants to paddle
can do so, and stay relatively warm and dry.  Bring a wetsuit if ya got it.

The directions are as follows:

&gt;From Atlanta:  (approximately 200 miles)
I-75 south to Macon and Interstate 16 east toward Savannah.
I-16 to Exit #14, Go south on Hwy#441
The park is about 25 miles down Hwy 441 give or take a few miles.

&gt;From Jacksonville:  (approximately 120 miles)
Hwy #1 north to Hwy #341 north in Baxley.  (left)
Hwy #341 north to Hwy #280 east just outside McRae.....(right)
Hwy 280 east to Hwy 441 north (only a few hundred yards).......(left)
Go about a mile and your there.

&gt;From Tampa:  (approximately 350 miles)
I-75 north to Hwy#280 east (right)
Hwy. #280 east to Hwy. #441 north
Go about a mile and your there.

&gt;From Savannah:  (approximately 100 miles)
Take I-16 to exit 14, Hwy 441 south.
Go about 25 miles and have a beer, or a coke if thats your preference.

I know many of you are really busy this time of year and I don't expect
this to be a very large gathering, but if ya come you will be welcome.  I
am cooking the turkey on Saturday so feel free to bring fixins and such to
go with the doomed bird.  I am sure we will make due either way though.
Food will be had by all!  No one leaves hungry!

Please reply with any questions directly to me.

Looking forward to it,
Charlie Ford
