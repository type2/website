&gt; There is a little &quot;B&quot; that is back lit on my dash, this is a familiar site

Bingo!  The light lights whenever there is a failure of one circuit of the
brake system.  VW had two different ways of checking this.  The older way
was to have an actual differential pressure switch built into the master
cylinder, located between the normal brake light switches.  Later models
got a different scheme where the two brake light pressure switches got an
additional terminal to operate the system and the differential pressure
switch was deleted.

I have had this light come on a couple of times and in both cases the
fault was in the switch, not the actual brakes.  I tested the brakes by
taking the bus onto a dirt road and locking the brakes up while rolling
slowly.  All four locked up at about the same time, so I started looking
for electrical problems.  I tried disconnnecting the brake warning light
wire from the pressure switches one at a time.  It's the black one, as
I recall.  One switch was making the light come on, so I replaced it.  the
problem went away.
