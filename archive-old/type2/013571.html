That box with the five wires is the resistor it is required to reduce the
voltage for the injectors.

The voltage regualtor is in the back of his alternator, it can be round
or rectangle shaped. They are about $35.00 new if you need one.

To repair the resistor unit you can take a small copper wire and wrap it
around a coat-hanger wire till you wind up with what looks like springs
out of ballpoint pens and then put it over the wires where that sloder to
the resistor unit. Resolder the wires with this reinfoecement and they'll
stay in place. The unit really doesn't build up that much heat so solder
holds even though the original electrical connection is a spot weld.

I'd look at the starter and make sure that the alternator is plugged onto
the push on terminal and be sure that the auxillary wire is connected to
the wire loom. (it has a little square connector).

Clean all the connectors that connect to the alternator.

&gt; I have a friend with a 1980 Vanagon. He seems to be having charging 
&gt; problems. He found a silver box on the firewall with 5 wires coming 
&gt; out of 
&gt; individual ceramic tubes. He says it's the voltage regulator. It 
&gt; definitely 
&gt; had problems. One of the wires was severed and 2 were frayed almost 
&gt; to the 
&gt; point of breaking.
&gt; 
&gt; I don't know much about these later beasts, but this thing sure 
&gt; doesn't 
&gt; look like any voltage regulator I've ever seen. My 1971 bus has it 
&gt; sitting 
&gt; right on the firewall where it belongs! This thing has a couple of 
&gt; part 
&gt; numbers:
&gt; 
&gt; 022 906079
&gt; 0 280 159 001
&gt; 
&gt; So my questions are:
&gt; 
&gt; 1. What is this thing?
&gt; 2. Would this thing cause the battery to not charge up?
&gt; 3. Where the heck is the voltage regulator?
