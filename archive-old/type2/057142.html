Subject: Dual Webers - emulsion tubes

Anyone looking for Weber carbs and/or parts might want to try:

I just called them and ordered some stuff.  They ship UPS ground for
free.  I ordered some emulsion tubes ($10each) and some jets ($3.50)
each and asked for 2-day air.  Only $8 extra.  Very fair pricing!

Now, on to the emulsion tubes...  Anyone out there using F7 tubes in
their dual IDF's?  

A friend of mine bought a set on recommendation from PMO and I got to
borrow them (briefly) to try in my 73 Westy (1.7 type IV motor).  I've
been running dual 40's for 7 years on this bus and KNOW how it feels
under each and every circumstance.  Swapped in the F7 (for the F11's
I've been running) and took it for a spin.  

WOW!  What a difference!  Absolutely NO stumbling on the transition
under mild/moderate acceleration.  No bucking at constant 45 mph speeds
(about 2400 rpm, near-closed throttle).  This was the BEST my bus has
ever felt.  So I've ordered a set of my own.  

After I've experimented more with them (maybe with some different jet
combos), I'll let you all know what I find.
