Subject: Aridzona Sale: Rare 1977 Highroof

This van is in Arizona. It has been mechanically rebuilt from brakes &amp; 
suspension to engine and fuel system. Over $6,000 invested mechanically. 
This was a rescue vehicle! When I bought, it the original owner's new 
rebuild had thrown a rod! It sat in storage for several years. It was 
slated to go scrap. The camper conversion was by Safare in California. 
It comes with the camper's interior: in the kitchenette is the propane 
stove &amp; fridge with table for 4. Sleeping area has a flat folding bed. 
There's also a working propane furnace for those cold nights camping! 
There's a working sky light in the top. New tires all around. Has dual 
battery system for camping &amp; driving. Has working propane and water 
tanks too! This one is tall; you can stand up in it all the time! Top 
reaches to just under 8 feet from parking lot. Rebuilt the 1.9L FI 
engine 10,000 miles ago. Has new clutch and front steering &amp; suspension! 
The van rides fantastic! Must sacrifice to the person that offers me 
$1,800. Can ship or drive it home yourself.
Timothy in Phoenix
