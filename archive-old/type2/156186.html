Subject: Re: [T2] alignment/steering system hell

I took my bus today to have it aligned and the guys there told me that my steering wheel wouldnt be straight because there was no way to adjust from the left side but there was from the right side....?  does that make sense,,,i didnt understand what they were talking about in hopes someone here would.... ??????/
   
  i will take it back and make them do it right i just need to know what the heck they meant....?
   
   
   
  well anyways the steering is lots i mean lots tighter but the bus still, when i take my hand off wheel goes completely to the right....?????????
   
  what kinds of BS am i being took for here....
  I looked up the alignment but didnt get what exactly to do... before i ever went to have it done....
   
  also were they suppose to mess with camber adjustments&gt;? cause they didnt....?
  is that good or bad...
   
  he put it on a laser tag kinda machine with big satelite disk on the rims... the laser shot it and made sounds...??&gt;?
