Subject: Re: [T2] gas mileage

Tony,

78 Champagne Edition...stock FI engine.

After making the trip to Oklahoma city and back last weekend(522 miles 
roundtrip) I got 17.54mpg on a bone stock avp rebuild with 1,000 miles on 
it.  i used 87 octane.  It is timed to bus specs and I had just put it 
back on points instead of the &quot;weird&quot; 42.7 degree dwell pertronix.

Traveled 261 miles with two stops at an average speed of 68mph....so you 
know I was pushing it hard...I know a lot of you don't like driving buses 
that fast, but I push all my vehicles hard....if they don't last, then
I learned what they need and do it better next time.

I looked at my copy of the original sticker when I got home and in 1978
the sticker said 25mpg hiway.

So, wasn't 1978 still 55mph limit?  Would my bus have done that much 
better at 55mph...from 17.54 to 25mpg?

Wups, just looked at one web site that &quot;says&quot; you can get 26% better 
mileage at 55 than 75(wich is what I mostly drove on the trip)...sooo...
1.26 * 17.54 = 22.1 miles per gallon...


If I remember back then, the EPA numbers were often about 2-3mpg
high, and you could never get those numbers, even in a new car of any 
kind.

Time for those folks with 230,000 on their odometers to look back in their 
mileage books and see what they got!

Cheers, dave
