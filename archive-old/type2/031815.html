??? about a 2 years ago I bought 4 Michelin 205R14 MXT tires load range
99S.
   they are not listed in the catalogs but they are avaliable via special
order.  took about a week to get em....

got em from NTB, they weren't cheap over $100 each but the best tires I've
had on any van I've owned....

&gt; Hanook and Nanking make both 185r14 and 195r14, load range D. I got 40,000
&gt; out of a pair of Nankings when I had a rear seperate, otherwise there was a
&gt; good 20,000 miles left on them. I am going to buy 2 more, use two of the
&gt; used ones and the third for a spare. $ my cost was $240.00 OTD for 4,
&gt; mounted, balanced and fed and disposal.

&gt; also I don't know if the rules had changed but to get the Michelin Agilis,
&gt; you would have to sign a release, as these tire are made exclusivly for the
&gt; Eurovans!

&gt; Hey Rick!
&gt; 
&gt; Bridgestone makes a 185R14 in a load range D in their 603V product.
&gt; Seems like a pretty good tire. It's the only product I know of in a D
&gt; load range in either size.
&gt; 
&gt; Call me if you have any other questions,
