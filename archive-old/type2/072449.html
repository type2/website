Subject: Cracks at the Spark Plug Holes

I took my 1600 cc dual port  heads off my engine the other day to replace some exhaust studs only to fine cracks at the spark plug holes.  I believe this is a common thing but am not sure what can be done to fix the problem, if anything can be done.  So are my heads junk now, can I get them repaired and if I can, can you give me the name of someone who repairs them.   Thanks
