        On my way over the siskiyous yesterday I stoped for a vanagon (it
looked a lot like mine, it would have been bad luck to not stop(besides,
sence I got on this list, I've been stoping for VWvans broken on the
hills(this was the first broken one I've seen in four years))).

        He had replaced his plugs at the rest area just before the big hills
and made it about ten miles before the plug (#3) and threads blew out.  I
radioed for a tow truck and recomended a air cooled mechanic in Ashland OR
that works almost exculsively on busses (he had an 80).

        Is there anything realistic that can be done by the side of the road
for striped out plud threads?
