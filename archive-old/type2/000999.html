Well, I knew the converter in my Westfalia wasn't stock, now I just need to
try to learn more about it.  It's manufactured by System Monitoring Inc. in
Winnipeg, Manitoba.  Could any listees in the Winnipeg area check your phone
directory to see if they still exist, and, if so, please p-mail me their
address or phone number?  I'm trying to figure out the wiring scheme - the
label on the side tells me that the white wires go to ground, the blue wires
go to the accessories, the red wire is the battery &quot;in&quot; and the yellow wire
is the battery &quot;out.&quot;  Fine, except there is no yellow wire... Just a red
wire, two white wires (one bolted to the case, one coming from the guts
inside.  Is wire number two my &quot;yellow wire&quot;?), and three blue wires  The
label shows that this is a 30 amp converter with a five-amp battery charger.
I want to rig this so that it will work with a deep-cycle battery and free
me from dependence on shore power.

Thanks in advance
