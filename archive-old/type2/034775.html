&gt;Hi,
&gt;
&gt;We want to remove and eventually re-torque the rear axle nuts. It's a 46mm
&gt;nut and requires 217 fl lbs according to the manual. We have a 150 ft lb
&gt;torque wrench and we're looking for a cheap torque multiplier to use with it
&gt;other than the 'torquemeister'? We'd rather not spend $200+ dollars for that
&gt;with the attachments needed. Can't seem to find any torque multipliers
&gt;around here. Also, we can't seem to find a 46mm socket at any of our local
&gt;stores.

If you wiegh 150 lbs use a 24&quot; breaker bar and put your full weight on it
at horizontal and it will be 300lbs + or -. Nudge it on if need be to
insert the cotter key. Clean the threads, bone dry and clean, then oiled
lightly with light maschine oil. This is pure Archemedes method and
requires no spendy tools. The ratio is weight X length = force. Try 217lbs
X 1 foot = 217 ft lbs.
150 lbs X 1.45 ft (1 ft 5+ in) = 217 ft lbs. 

Some guys put these on at 400 ft lbs. No fun for someone who has not
addressed these forces before.
