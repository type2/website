Hello
I've read the archive till i turned blue the past 2
days on this carb. It is a Weber 32/36 DFEV and it seems
others have had similar problems with this carb in cold
weather.
(snip)

I have a few suggestions. One would be to go to the local auto salvage and
get an aircleaner from a Pinto. These had an inlet to duct hot air into the
carb. Then get the duct from a 72-74 Carbed Bus that ducts the hot air up.
One peice looks like a Toilet seat and the other a Banana. Then just duct
the hot air up to the aircleaner. There is a vacuum pot on the end to open
or close the door to allow the hot air in. You could connect this to an
electric vacumm solinoid (like on the 80's Mopars) and put a switch on the
dash to control it. 
What this would do is allow you to suck hot air into the carb and the carb
would not ice up. It would also allow you to switch it to cold air after it
warmed up.
The other option is from a company in the UK. They offer a little blanket
that wraps around the intake of a type 1 to warn it up. It has a sencor in
it to only come on when its too cold. On a type 1 you would only need 1 and
it runs off the coil wire. But on a type 4 you would need 4 (4 intake
runners) and I would use a relay right off the battery. I used to have the
web page address, but I have lost it now. This would work good, but they are
$40ea, so it would cost $160 for 4,+ shipping. 
Running it too rich is not good, but carb iceing is bad also. Also the
80-85(?) Dodge cars with the carbs used a Weber type carb with the same carb
top. So the air cleaner from one of those would work too. It is a two peice
kind of like the old Bus ones, but for a Weber. The aircleaner is in a box,
and a duct goes to the top of the carb. Put a VW sticker on it and it would
look stock.
