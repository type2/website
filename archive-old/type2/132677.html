&gt; Anyway, the problem I'm having that's bugging me the most is a
&gt; stumble/misfire at part throttle under load.  It can be somewhat
&gt; intermittent, but is there 90% of the time.  The engine revs fine in
&gt; neutral and most of the time the problem will go away under full
&gt; throttle, but not always.  Feels like a hard miss, it'll start
&gt; bucking about mid throttle and midway through the RPM range.  The two
&gt; things that come to mind are bad fuel since it did sit for at least a
&gt; year or the air flow meter.  I did some searching through the
&gt; archives but didn't come across anything that really addressed the
&gt; problem I'm having, so hopefully someone out there can give me some
&gt; direction.  I've gone through about one tank of fuel since picking it
&gt; up and it does run a LOT better now in general, but this bucking miss
&gt; has got to stop.            

It does kinda sound like an AFM problem. You should inspect it (if you
haven't already) for worn tracks on the board. I had the same problem on my
'78. When I checked it out, the tracks were obviously worn down to nothing
and replacing the AFM fixed 'er right up.
