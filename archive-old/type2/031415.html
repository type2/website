just saw on the side of the road with a for sale sign a nice looking late
bay Westy.

School bus yellow (yuk) but it is a nice looking job (seen at 30mph)

if anyone is interested it is parked on a gas station lot facing York Road
about 2miles north of Towson.

really interested I could run out there and get some more info (I was with
my wife and we were late or I would have stopped then)

Bob
