Some observations on Merc wheel compatibility with VW Vans.

First, the DISCLAIMER:

First, the below calculations are based on numbers provided by someone else,
and I'm assuming the measurements regarding rims and offsets are correct,
without personal knowledge of the same.

Second, I recall reading somewhere that that Bolt shoulder angle is
different for Merc and VW rims.  Perhaps someone can confirm or deny this,
and perhaps the solution is to use Merc lug nuts, if the thread patterns are
the same as VW.  Perhaps someone can let us know?


Working with Holly and Chris' information, I performed the following
interesting calculations:

The VW wheel is 5.5&quot;, which is 14cm (2.54 cm/inch)
If the offset is 25mm, or 2.5 cm, then that gives a ratio of .1785 to the
full width.
In other words, 2.5 cm is 17.85% of 14 cm or 5.5&quot;

If the Merc wheel is 6&quot;, then it is 15.25 cm
If the offset is 25mm, that gives a ratio of .1639, or 16.39% of 6 inches

Seems to me, a 6&quot; wheel should maintain the same aspect ratio as the VW rim,
not to put undue outboard stress on the system.  Thus, one can calculate the
required offset by using the aspect ratio of .1785 against 6 inches, or
15.25 cm.

This gives an offset of 27mm, a difference of only 2 mm, or about 1/8 of an
inch.

Seems to me to be pretty close to VW's 25mm, and unless a better informed
expert would explain otherwise, I can't see the thickness of 2 dimes making
a difference under the fender.

Of course, fit under the fender without hitting anything is another issue
alltogether, and so is the drag aspect of a fat tire with no power streering
when you are trying to park a 5,000 lb vehicle!  I suspect the 6 inch rim
wouldn't run any problems, and may be a good match for anyone wishing to run
the 205/70 series tires.

A 6.5&quot; wheel on these calculations should have an offset of 2.947 cm, or
29.5 mm, rounded off, to maintain the same centre line as the VW 5.5 rim.
If the offset is only 25mm, that puts it out by 4.5 mm, or about 3/8th of an
inch for those who don't get metric.  Again, unless an expert provides
otherwise, seems to me that this isn't a huge difference from stock.

Given that the greatest clearance concerns will be on the inboard side of
the rim, with rather than outboard, and given the smaller degree to which a
6 inch merc rim with the same 25mm offset as the stock vw rim would move the
centre line of the tire outboard of the van, I can't see that this setup
would have anything to be concerned about.

Even the 6.5&quot; wheel seems not to give much trouble with the offset
difference, but all of the extra inch of wheel would be outboard, which
could give rise to clearance troubles with the fender.  I've no idea.
Someone who has actually tried it would have to comment.

I'm working on this. The wheel pattern is right but the offset is the
question.

Now at least I know we are close. I am trying to see how the 25MM VW offset
on 5.5 inch wide wheels jives with a 6&quot; or 6.5&quot; wheel with a 25MM offset on
the Merc.

This is also the only car that has the same weight class. Passat and Audi
are much too light. They have the right wheel pattern but do not have the
weight capacity and the offset is wrong.

I'm trying to run without spacers or adaptor plates.

Do the Merc wheels have the same bolt pattern and set back?

thanks.

More info from the Mercedes list on wheels for our busses:

The 126 up through 1985 came with 14&quot; wheels.

Numbers for  the 126 from '86 through end of production are:

300 SE, 420 SE/SEL, 560 SEL, 300 SDL, 350 SDL.

The earlier models are the 300 SD, 380 SE/SEL, and 500 SEL.

A big thank you to the Mercedes list!
