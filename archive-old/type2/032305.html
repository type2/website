Hello,

My '74 bus is getting closer and closer to roadworthiness. I can drive it
all around my driveway now!

There is one problem left, I have no reverse. But I have a few questions
regarding this. This bus sat for 4 years before I got my hands on it. A
few weeks back I posted about clutch adjustments. After replacing the
cable, which was too rusty to adjust, I finally got the clutch pedal
within tolerable adjustment. When I first got it close enough to use, 1st
and 3rd made a grinding/popping noise when I shifted to them(this
was a different sound that the 'clutch adjustment' grinding). They worked
fine, just made that loud noise (to which I was accoustomed from my old
bus). A couple days later I went out and started it again. I put the bus
in first and before I let up on the clutch I heard a loud pop, and it
popped out of first. It was not an encouraging sound, but when I put it 
back in gear, no more popping or grinding on any gears. Nice and
quiet shifting, a first for me in a bus :) . (???)

Could that be just old gearbox oil sitting around for 4 years?

Since I've got it running, I haven't had reverse. When i shift to where
reverse normally is and let up the clutch pedal, I move forward.... not
sure if im in first or second, but definatly moving the wrong direction.
My old bus did this every second or third time i put it in reverse, but if
i took it out and put it back in, eventually i would go backwards...
I've tried that repeatedly, but It just wont' go backwards...

Could this be related to the noises?

Is this a linkage problem? or a tranny problem?

please help :)
