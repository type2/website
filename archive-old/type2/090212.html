Subject: Re: [T2] &quot;Fun&quot; sounds ;-P

&gt; I'm quite a novice when it comes to all of this.  All I know for sure is
&gt; that it's an 1800 Porsche engine and it's not fuel-injected.  Beyond that,
&gt; I don't have much info for you.

If it is a 914 engine then it may have a lot higher compression. This
could complicate things.
You might try to identify all of the components first before proceeding.
