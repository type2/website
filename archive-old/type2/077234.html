&gt; &gt;I was going to do the same (wrap my pipes) until an old racer

It does 
&gt; &gt;make power but it leads to periodical pipe replacement. I guess it 
just 
&gt; &gt;depends on what you use your vehicle for. I'm always lacking cash 
for 
&gt; &gt;replacement pipes or spares...
&gt; 
&gt; I'm not sure I buy the &quot;damage to pipes&quot; argument on a bus.  On a 
race car, 
&gt; sure.  At full throttle, lightweight headers can glow red hot.  

And so can thick headers.  It just takes longer for them to warm up 
due to the added mass.

Contain 
&gt; that heat with header wrap, and yeah I could see it damaging the 
&gt; pipes.  I'm not sure that the thick bus exhaust pipes would ever get 
that 
&gt; hot.

The heat has to escape somewhere or else heat up the pipe.  If you 
insulate the outside of the pipe, the pipe will heat up to the 
temperature of the exhaust gas, as little of the heat can escape 
through the insulation.

The bus pipes may last longer than thin headers, but it will 
definitely corrode faster internally than unwrapped headers.  The fact 
that metal corrodes faster at higher temperatures is not affected by 
the thickness of the metal involved.

  I'm definately going to wrap my heater pipes  and junction boxes 
with 
&gt; the stuff, and I will probably wrap my heater boxes too.  As for the 
pipes, 
&gt; I don't think there would be a significant benefit so I probably 
won't do 
&gt; it, but it's not because I'm afraid of damaging them.  I'm more 
concerned 
&gt; with water getting under the wrap and rusting the heater boxes.  
Hopefully 
&gt; it will evaporate fast enough that it won't be a problem.
&gt; 
&gt; Next time I get a decent set of heater boxes (the 3-year-old Dansk 
boxes I 
&gt; have now don't qualify) I am going to ceramic-coat the outsides and 
put an 
&gt; end to rust and heat loss once and for all.  It's expensive, but you 
only 
&gt; have to pay for it once.
