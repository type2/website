&gt;      Well I think I found the source of my pinging on my 79 Std.  With the
&gt; stock distributor, the total advance is supposed to be about 25-26 degrees
&gt; max.  Mine is 33 degrees.  It is timed at 5BTDC &amp; it is supposed to be
&gt; 7.5BTDC.  Almost all the advance is coming from the centrifugal part &amp;
about
&gt; 9 degrees is from the vacuum part.  The question is, do I look for a new
&gt; distributor or do I just set the timing at idle to whatever it takes to
get
&gt; 25-26 degrees of total advance?  Any ideas?  Thanks.
&gt;

Whoa, stop...you don't have enough advance. Not sure where you got the 25-26
total advance figure from. You have a 79 Federal version bus because you
have a single vacuum advance and points, correct? You have either a 021 905
205P or a 022 905 205S distributor? The total centrifical advance is 20.5-
24.5 at 3400 rpms + 8.5- 11 vacuum advance at 7.9 in. hg. + 7.5 initial
degrees. This will give you a low of 36.5 to a high of 44 TOTAL advance.
When it is working correctly, your timing mark will advance to the 'o' of
vor to the left of 40 on your timing band when you rev the engine.
If your engine is really pinging with the little total advance you have, you
have too much compression ratio. How much carbon build-up do you have on top
of the pistons??
My 77 Westy has the correct total advance and I burn the cheapest 87 octane
at the pumps. No problems at all climbing hills or driving in 105 degree
heat.
