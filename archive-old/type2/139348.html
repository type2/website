&gt; No, I did not retorque the heads.
&gt;  
&gt;  What about replacing  the whole head with a good one that I have?  
&gt; Is there a problem with using  one with 30K miles and one with 5K?

Probably no need to do that. You're pulling the engine and one head.
Pull them both, check the mating surfaces. MAYBE have the valve seats
lapped. Get a good look at the valves themselves. 

Mine had to get loose enough to start losing compression before I
finally figured it out. I didn't have a constant net connection to ask
about it at the time. A quick clean up and it was good for a lot more
miles.

After you put it back together don't forget to retorque the heads after
500 - 1000 miles.
