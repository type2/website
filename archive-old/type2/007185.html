&gt;Actually, Todd, it's against the law to make even one copy of a 
&gt;manual. You can copy parts of it, not the whole thing. 

And even parts of it I'd get permission for beforehand. The current law states
that what
is considered 'fair use' is open to interpretation. Though there are a 3 or 4
different guidelines
that publishers agree on which determines what is 'fair use'  or 'fair
dealing' in the UK, it's left
up to each individual publisher to determine what is or isn't fair use for the
property they own. Thats why
it's always good to ask permission first.

&gt;And making a bunch of copies of, say, chapter 4, to distribute to others, is
also a no-no. 
&gt;Teachers and professors can usually get permission to make multiple 
&gt;copies of certain sections, but only for use in their classes, and not the 
&gt;whole book or magazine. 

and they pay royalty fees Per page Per copy!

&gt;OTOH, places like Kinko's which were copying parts 
&gt;of books and selling them to students got nailed big-time recently. 

In 1991 several publishers sued Kinkos and won, at which point Kinko's got out
of the course pack 
business.

&gt;And just because it's out of print means nothing. The copyright is in 
&gt;full effect for 50 years, I believe. And some publishers pay a bounty 

As of last week, Clinton changed the law, it's now 70 years after the death of
the Author in most cases.
