Subject: Re: [T2] 30 mm Berg oil pump in a type IV?

on 2/25/04 16:05, Jeff Strickrott related:
&gt; 
&gt; Aircooled_dot_net sells the 30 mm Schadeck without the O-ring modification,
&gt; and John states that the type IV can handle the extra volume, however he
&gt; also states that the pump will blow out my oil cooler with 30/40 weight
&gt; oil when cold. I run straight 40 here in Florida, but it does
&gt; occasionally get below 60F.

i have the schadek 30mm pump in my '79 bus. there is no problem at all in
using it. the only issue is that it can supply a bit too much pressure,
which can result in the oil bypassing the cooler, even when hot. the stock
engine is designed to run at relatively low pressure.

i would be concerned with under 10psi at idle on a brand new engine, but
don't necessarily look to the oil pump for the problem. i am surprised john
from ac_dot_net forgot to mention his oil pressure relief seat re-facing tool,
it does work to increase oil pressure on rebuilt engine, where the relief
seat may be worn. there are other, uglier, reasons why you might have low
oil pressure. the thing is, it will only get worse as the engine loosens up
over time.

didn't this engine also have very low vacuum at idle? that could easily be
blamed on something NOT done by the builder, but low oil pressure happens
inside the long block.

my 2 cents, you might be best off to send it back to them, as odious as that
must sound.
