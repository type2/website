Subject: RE:  cool collar oil cooler

&gt;just thumbing thru J.C. whipme catalog and saw this.  It is a cool collar 
&gt;that fits over your oil filter to cool down oil temps. It says it can be
used 
&gt;year after year.  It is $14.95 and the part number is 81AN4694Y.

On a type IV motor, I doubt if you'd even be able to use it due to no
clearance around the edge of the filter.  And even if it did fit, you'd have
no air flow.  If you're running a type 1 motor with full flow and have your
filter located elsewhere, you could probably put one on, but I serious doubt
the heat transfer between the filter and the collar would be sufficient for
the tradeoff in additional surface area to make any difference.  In short,
don't waste your $$.
