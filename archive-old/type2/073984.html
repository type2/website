&gt; The three bolts that mount the engine to the mustache bar in 68-71 bus - are
&gt; they specialized?  Anyone know the specs on them? Are there spacers?

Not specialized that I know of.

Make sure that the bolts do not bottom in their holes before they go
tight.  If they do, you need spacers.  I've found that different engines
require different spacers depending upon how the holes were threaded.
