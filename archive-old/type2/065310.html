Subject: I got a Dormobile Roof (splitty)

Well this weekend on the tip from a fellow bus enthusaist I managed to
score a Dormobile Roof (if you don't know what this is please disregard the
rest of the mail) off a 65' bus (only a 1000 km round trip road trip to do
so!).

I am now faced witht he prospect of installing (and cutting a huge hole!)
the Dorm roof on my currently hardtopped bus. I would like to hear
anybody's thoughts on who has proceeded to install the top.

If anyone has any spare Dorm parts I would like to hear from them.

Also I know this thread has been discussed to death but what have people
had luck using to rejuvinate a grubby oxidized pop top??
