Hi, Volks:

Speaking of sleeping in a Bus. . .  I have a drop-in
replacement sofa/bed (full width) for sale that will convert
your Kombi Bus into a Weekender.  It's professionally made
and comes with an engine area pad.  Request more info and
I'll e-mail a JPEG image for you to see.
It's all quite trick, and looks nice in a breadloaf style
Bus ('72-79')

Cheers,
