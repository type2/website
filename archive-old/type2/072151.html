Subject: &quot;can't find the title&quot; in california

listees! i am considering buying a bay where the owner can't find the title
and never filed for a replacement. owner and bus are in california. is
there a way around this, like a duplicate title that can be picked up in
one day at the dmv? i am trying to prevent a case of the sketchies, and
being able to get a clean slip in oregon as easily as usual. is going
through sacto essential? any ideas on a process that has worked are
welcome. thanks,
steve
