All,

Today, being a really bad day, was topped off with something breaking.

I was driving home today from school.  For the past couple of days my Westy
has been acting wierd. At low RPM's it was acting as if it was firing on only
three cylinders, except there was no power loss.  At high RPM's it acted as it
always did, good performance, reasonable gas mileage.

Well, when I got almost home, I heard this hammering noise.  Seeing as I was
in the middle of an intersection, I had to drive on.  I did not notice any
power loss while I pulled out of the intersection and off to the side of the
road, in fact there was no noticable power loss at all, yet the pounding
sound(hammer on metal, type sound), did not change.  After listening to it, it
appears to come from side only, but seeing as it is late, I did not climb
under to pinpoint it any further.  

Any suggestions at to what it could be would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks in advance,

David
