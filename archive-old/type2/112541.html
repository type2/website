Subject: CV bolt spacer?

I was getting ready to reinstall my CV alxes and noticed that I had two 
different kinds of bolt spacers. I have ONE that fits and all the others do 
not. The difference is a little notch that is cut out of the spacer to fit 
around this particular CV boot that has little nubs all the way around the 
metal ring that fits up againsted the joint. I have one of the other spacers 
(without cut out) that is bent up like someone put it on this type of CV boot 
regardless of these little nubs and torqued it down anyway. My question is, is 
it alright to use the spacers without the notch, and torque the notchless 
spacer down until they are bent? Or find some of these spacers with the cut out?
Do other cars use these same spacers and should I be able to go to any parts 
place and get them?
