Subject: Hydraulic valves or solid? New question!!!

Now that everyone is wound up over the valves, now
comes a question. Why are there a camshaft for hyd
lifters when they will work on the solid lifter
camshaft? why are the pushrods a different size? Last
can hyd lifters be put into a case without changing
anything? Seems what the list has said is that hyd
lifters can be put into a case without any problem, I
just took it for granted that something was different
on the engines because the camshafts were different,
let me know the truth...Phil
