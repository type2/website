Central Illinois. This vehicle has more character than anything I've
ever owned. Manual trans. New clutch. Runs well enough but could use
some love. Pop top good. Very solid underneath. A little rust otherwise.
Water tank and pump work great. Love this old bus, Through many fully
loaded camping trips it NEVER left me by the side of the road. I even
ambulanced someone in it once! New Michelins, KYB gasadjust shocks, CV's
just rebuilt and booted. Electric defroster. Even have the original
radio somewhere. Looking for 1500.00 bucks or so. Make me an offer off
list please. (217)899-5111.
