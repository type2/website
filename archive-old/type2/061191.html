Has
&gt;anyone ever removed a fuel pump without taking the engine out?  I would
&gt;love to know how.



Hi Dave
Yes it can be done - I did it in similar weather about this time last year
and I remember the numb fingers.

If you can loosen the air duct which runs above it will help - I could only
get one end off and managed to move it to one side so I could get at the
Allen bolt. I also found it helped to cut the long end of the key down. It's
a bugger though and if you don't get it back on tight you'll leak oil all
over.
