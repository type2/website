&gt;And finally a word of advice................Get yourself a good shop manual
&gt;(Robert Bentley's Official VW Service Manual for Type2 - look for the green
&gt;cover - is great)  Get and old one at a book reseller, save yourself some
&gt;cash, and get wiring diagrams (which it seems you'll need) in color.
&gt;
&gt;Let me know how it's going for you!

Thanks Mike.  I did order a Bentley from Amazon.  Are you saying the new 
ones are not in color?  Will it at least have the color codes in it?

You're right there's a bird's nest under there, but it looks simple enough 
to sort out...at least it's not very many circuits compared to a modern car. 
  The wires seem brittle, almost like solid core.  One thing that pisses me 
off is that someone pulled the red and blue knobs off the air vent slides 
for what I can only assume was to install that temp gauge in the clock hole. 
  They're in the glove box, totally thrashed and the arms are bent.  It 
looks like the arms have snap rivits and could have been pulled out without 
destruction.  Just poking his head under the dash before doing anything 
stupid would have been nice.  Anyway, the left two seem like &quot;heat&quot; and the 
right two seem like &quot;vent.&quot;
