Subject: Re: [T2] CV Joint what is this part called 

&gt; Is this what your seeing?

I'm sorry I can't answer you question but it does appear that Bentley
VW manual made for this item saying &quot;early models&quot;  Maybe it was 
 thought to be unnecessary on later models???  My 77 bus doesn't have
 these caps. And a '78 I worked on didn't have these either.
 
 Someone please verify this for me.
Also Mick said in an early post his bus is a '69.
 
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

That cap does not show up at all in my 68-72 parts book. Neither pictured nor listed in the 
text. I looked at both the axle section and the differential section.
The 68-70 factory repair manual makes no mention of it either.
