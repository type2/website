Subject: Re: [T2] I scored an engine, now what?

 done to an engine that has been sitting this long? 
&gt; Lubrication? Good karma mojo? or anything you would do to it before 
--------------------
Change the oil strainer, filter, oil if it has them. I'd look at the
pilot bushing in the end of the crank shaft too.
Replace the front seal, rear seal, squirt some oil in the cylinders, turn
it over with the coil wire grounded until you get oil pressure. Put the
coil wire in and crank it.
