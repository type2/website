&gt;   I have been on these list since their inception. This debut on gear oil
&gt;has gone on since the beginning.

The issue arose when GL-5 was first released. Porschephiles always wanting 
the best for their cars ignored spec and put in GL-5 assuming it was 
better. The rate of early failure of the synchros was significant enough 
for Porsche to advise against it's use for all the moly coated Porsche 
synchro designs. It's not that they all failed, but the increase in failure 
with GL-5 was considerable, compared to no premature wear with GL-5. THEY 
SAID, not me, that GL-5 is not approved for those trannies. VW said 
nothing. There spec was GL-4 and no need to state what the spec wasn't, 
cause VW people don't want more expensive spec and didn't jump on GL-5.

I say it is arrogant as hell to think you know more than the team of 
engineers who set the specs. EGO spewing testaments.
