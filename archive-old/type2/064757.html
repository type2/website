&gt; Dear list,
&gt;   The inevitable has finally happened to me: The fuel gauge sender unit
&gt; croaked. Goes to zero when tank is still half full. Question: Is it possible
&gt; to access
&gt; the tank and replace it without pulling the engine? Any experiences welcome!

Hey I believe you can do this on a 73 , i know i can on a 71.
take out the rear seat and cut a hole in the middle of the piece of metal
about 3 to four inches up.  You should be able to replace the sending unit
in the gas tank without removing the motor by doing this...
