Subject: Re: [T2] Front Axle/Engine Seal Bonanza



&gt; the drag link can be a bear.
&gt; Ive broken tie rod end removal pullers before. If you buy a puller get a
&gt; good one from someplace you can return the broken one back to.
&gt; Ive had better success with a pickle fork and BFH combined with heat and
&gt; liquid wrenching spray.
&gt; OTOH you might get lucky and it could be only pretty darn stuck as oposed
&gt; to really freaking stuck.
&gt; Ive actually given up on one before when the fork, pbblaster, propane
&gt; torch and broken puller all failed. I let a good steering box go to the
&gt; crusher.

I've had luck with a 2-hammer technique.  You need a 2-pound short sledge and a hefty ball-peen hammer.  Loosen the nut on the drag 
link, but don't remove it completely.  Hold the sledge up against one side of the pitman arm where the rod end tapered pin goes through.  
Use the ball-peen hammer to give the opposite side of the pitman arm a good whack.  The &quot;axis&quot; of your whack should be perpendicular 
to the axis of the tapered pin of the rod end.  The idea is to deform the tapered hole of the end of the pitman arm slightly to get it to 
release the tapered pin.  With the big hammer absorbing the blow, the force doesn't go into the steering box.
