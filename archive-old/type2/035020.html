Subject: new trans; won't shift

This may be premature, but I'm worried.

Last year, I pulled the engine and trans from my '71 Westy. I bought a
(partially) rebuilt trans from someone who used to be part of this list but
who will go unnamed at this time.   I replaced all three shift rod
bushings, greased the shift rods, and mounted rods and trans in the Westy.
Fast forward many months to Saturday.  The engine rebuild is all but at a
standstill. Like most other folks, finding a few minutes of garage time is
not easy.

To whet my apetite, I sat in the driver's seat on Saturday, stared out the
windshield trying to remember how it was to actually drive a Westy, and
then tried to move the shifter through the gears. No luck.  It won't engage
in any of the five &quot;slots&quot;.

I had hoped to make it through life without learning about transmissions.
Can anyone suggest a reason for the lack of movement?  If I pull the trans
and remove the bell housing, is there a quick fix?

Thanks, Jack
