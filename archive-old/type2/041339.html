&lt;&lt; Don't wanna open this debate again, but Steve, the one you traded to me 
seems
 to run just fine.
 I'll know more in the winter when the fuel condesation thing becomes an 
issue,
 but it's fine now - runs a little rich, but hey - rich means a little cooler
 maybe and thats good for me. &gt;&gt;

You're right that I did get that carb to run okay during warm weather.  My 
mechanic and I experimented with quite a few different jets and a few other 
modifications to get to where the carb would move my bus down the road, 
though a little rich.

The problems are that most models of this kit will not work with your stock 
vacuum advance dizzy, and the most common option is the 009, which has in my 
opinion too steep of a curve.  Also, as I stated, we had to try quite a few 
different jetting options, as the carb didn't run too well out of the box.

In addition, this was the third carb I brought home from the local VWFLAPS.  
The first 2 were rebuilt units, that either wouldn't idle, or would'nt run at 
all.  The third unit (the one you now have) was brand new.

The big problem with this carb was operating in cool or cold weather.  The 
fuel condenses before it reaches the heads, and you get very poor mileage and 
stumbling.

I tried to route warm air over the manifold during cold conditions, but this 
only helped in cooler weather, not when it was really cold.

So, I will agree that under certain conditions, you can use the weber 
progressive with limited success, but I don't feel it was worth the 
aggravation, when the Weber dual 34 ICT kit isn't much more, and was even 
easier to install.
