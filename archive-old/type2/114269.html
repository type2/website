&gt;I was hoping the person who posted this message would follow up with some
&gt;photos.

This would be Crazy Terry.  I wouldn't be surprised if he were camping out
at Motorola every night just to get some pictures.  What he wants to do is
catch it out and run the poor guy driving it off of the road so that he can
take pictures to post to the list.  He is really excited about it!
