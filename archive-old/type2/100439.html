Subject: bus toy bashing (friday)

  Let me just be the first one to thank matchbox, hotwheels, and johnny 
lightning, for completely flooding the market with low quality junk.  I have 
been a bus toy collector for about 14 years now and have seen it go from 
nice, low production, high qulity collectibles, and vintage classics, to new 
junk with cheesy matchbox paintjobs.  Now don't get me wrong, for a kid, 
these are great, but almost no value to a seriuos collector.  There are just 
way too many!  Matchbox, from what I have seen, has two terrible catings of 
the bus.  Does not even have the strip of metal between the windshields.  
Hot wheels are all drag cars with different paint jobs. And Johnnys have 
painted on windows. Crrrraaaap!!!!  Now I spend my time on auction sites 
wading through lots of low quality, high priced junk, just to find one piece 
worth buying!  Though there are always exceptions to the rule, for the most 
part, the market has become totally flooded, almost to the point of bringing 
value down.  Do not pay alot for these models, for in time I believe they 
will be like the cabbage patch kids. (unless you are buying them for your 
son or daughter to play smash up derby)   whew!  gripe off!
