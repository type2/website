Hello Type 2 People,

I'm sure that none of you all remember me but I was subscribed to this list 
briefly last year as my friend and I were getting ready to take a roadtrip 
from Seattle to San Diego in his 78 Type 2.  I was the mechanic on the trip 
and wanted to gather up as much information as I could before we left, so that 
is how I found the list.  All went well on the trip with only one &quot;breakdown&quot; 
along the way.  The engine lost a spark plug right outside of Salinas.  
Luckily we had AAA and the tow truck driver was a VW-fan and took us to a 
great VW only shop in Salinas.  They fixed us up and we were on our way!

So now I come back to the list asking for help again.  His Bus has a sunroof 
but we have never opened it.  His mother was the previous owner and she said 
that it was broken.  I would love to fix the sunroof as his b-day present and 
wanted to ask you all what this would entail, places to get parts, and any 
hints/tips for this job.

I wish I could give you more information about his Bus and the sunroof but I'm 
not too hip on Type 2s (now ask me a question about a Toyota MR2 and I 
probably know the answer).  The sunroof on his Bus is the metal sliding type.  
To be honest I do not know exactly what is wrong with it.  If you need any 
other information about it, please let me know and I can probably find out.

Thanks in advance for all of your help!  I really think my buddy will enjoy a 
working sunroof!
