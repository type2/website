Hi Chet,

    Why would he &quot;be belligerent&quot;, and &quot;for sure over charge&quot; you? Do you
have some preconceived option of auto technicians in general, or is it just
this one in particular?
    You sing the praises of the technicians on the list for their help, and
then insult them in the same sentence, and for a lot less than $ .02. How
about the remark about &quot;just for a coil&quot;, why didn't you just replace the
coil in the first place? Why did you have to humble your self to the list
technicians in the first place? Could it be than you didn't have the years
of experience, or the sometimes thousands of dollars of test equipment it
takes to diagnosis some of the harder electronic problems. Come by some day
when we have an intermittent dying CIS - Motronic car in the shop. I'll let
you use our $15,000.00 Sun engine analyzer, $2500.00 worth of OTC four
channel lab scope, $4000.00 Sun four gas C/O % analyzer, not to mention a
K-zillion dollars worth of hand tools, insurance, workman's comp, waste
disposal, ETC, ETC, ETC.
    Kind of like bad mouthing farmers with your mouth full!
    Ok, I'll get off the soap box for now, it just burns me every now and
then when someone takes a whole industry, puts them all in a bag a shakes it
up, and labels them all the same &quot;bad&quot;! We have all had a bad experience
with a certain type, no matter what field he/she (equal opportunity turds)
works in. Than doesn't mean everyone in that field is a jerk.
    Bottom line, give your friendly technician a break, take him/her out to
lunch, send him/her a thank you note (and mean it). Or just for the hell of
it, if you don't have anything good to say, don't say anything at all!

&gt; I just wanted to thank everyone for their $.02 in helping me figure out my
&gt; non-starting '77 Westy--which, by the way, was worth a hell of a lot more
&gt; than .02 since I would have had to paid to have her towed, and then fixed
by
&gt; a beligerant VW mechanic who would for sure overcharge me....for just a
&gt; coil!  Yep, turned out to be the coil--she fired right up.  Anyhow, thanks
&gt; again to everyone--does anyone know of a bus gathering anytime this summer
&gt; in the midwest?
