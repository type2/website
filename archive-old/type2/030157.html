&gt; course wants no part of going on. 
&gt; 
&gt; so here I sit, half shaft is in the freezer in the basement, CV joint goes
&gt; into the oven in the morning, set up the press....hopefully I'm ready to
&gt; go at first light.

New joints sometimes come with really sharp edges that don't get along
with the axle.  The dry moly lube they put on the joints often interferes
as well.  I've taken a jeweler's file to the splines on new joints and to
the end of the splines on the axle near the snap ring groove to good
effect. I don't get carried
away, just deburr the ends and clean out the Moly lube.  The joint, once
started, should go on with minor encouragement from a brass hammer.
