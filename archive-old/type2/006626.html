Hi Joe;

I'm sure there was a 1969 model year specific Campmobile manual, but it
probably differs little from 1968 and 1970 manuals.  My 1970 Campmobile
manual has photos of several details that don't match our '70 Westy, but do
match details in the '68 Westy we used to own.

Scans of both my 1970 Owners Manual and 1970 Campmobile Manual are on a
couple of websites, but the only one I recall just now is
http://thesamba_dot_com/vw/
Click on Type 2, then follow the &quot;literature&quot; link to the manual index.

FWIW.....

&gt;&gt;  Does anyone know if there was ever a Westfalia owner's manual supplement
printed specifically for 1969?  I've searched high and low and I've
obtained ones dated 1968 and 1970, but I have yet to see one dated
1969.  I've searched eBay, checked at Vintage Motorbooks (the one Fred S.
recommends), searched places on the web, but no luck.  So now I'm starting
to wonder if one exists?  Anybody have any proof otherwise?  &lt;&lt;
