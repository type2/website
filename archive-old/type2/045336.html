Subject: [T2] pulling heads (type IV)

If I'm pulling the left side (3&amp;4) head with the engine in-situ, do I
have to pull the rocker assembly?  As far as I got last night, I've
still got one stubborn peice of tin (the top section that screws into
the head) to go and then it looks like I'd have to pull the rockers. 
THey're not going to explode in my hands and turn into a mess of springs
and washers, are they?

Chris.
