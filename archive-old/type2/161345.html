&gt;on a 1978 2.0 FI , is tdc when the intake valve closes completely.  i have
&gt;obsereved the valves while i turn the bolt on the alternaotor.  it does not
&gt;seem that the notch is lining up with o at that point.  just after the
&gt;intake valve closes( comes to the top).   when is tdc according to the
&gt;valves.

It's when both valves are closed. As the rotate the engine clockwise from TDC you will notice the exhaust valve opening. Rotate CCW and you'll see the intake open.
