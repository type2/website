I have purchased several times from them. Stock muffler components and
seals. The seals were ok the muffler components were good, just like
original and lasted well. They did make an error in shipping a catalytic
converter though. After that I may have been a PITA to deal with on the
phone but got the part straight the first time. BTW the part number in their
catalog was wrong for a 79 catalytic. Prices seem good to great depending on
what your looking for.
