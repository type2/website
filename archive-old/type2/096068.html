Subject: Re: Re tire size- correcting taller tranny gearing?

&gt; Quoth George Lyle:  The correct size is 185R14. With no center number,

&gt; &gt; &gt; Your better choice would have been 195/75......
&gt; Quoth Bob (Acess Systems) : or as I have 205/70
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; In reference to using 205/70, this is the least tall tire- I get the
&gt; following measurements: STANDARD=0.82X185= 151.7mm sidewall height from
&gt; rim.  195/75 is 195X0.75 =146.25mm and 205/70 is 143.5mm.    Now I gotta
&gt; ask, if you stick a later tranny (77, 78) in a 75 bus, would the smaller
&gt; tires be of any value in giving more stock gearing?  Besides causing a
&gt; &quot;lower gear factor&quot;, the wide footprint means more steering wheel
&gt; resistance at low speeds, abad consequence, yes?

the difference in size (diameter) is so small that the difference in not
noticable, but the handling sure is better.
