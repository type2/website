Subject: Re: [T2] 79 cal. wiring harness

You just might find that Campbell-Nelson in Lynwood, WA, probably has one 
for you. Ask for the Used Parts Department for used and New Parts dept for 
new. The used parts dept has been breaking Porsches, VW's and Saabs for 
many years and is a great source. In the 16 years or so I've been dealing 
with them, they still have at least 4 or 5 people out of 7 still there 
after all that time. Lots of VW parts knowledge from way back. Brand new VW 
Bug fenders up in the rafters if you want real German steel type Bettle. 
Geeze, would they have some real T-II German steel battery fixer panels?? 
If anyone might, they might.

For the harness, make sure to have on hand the numbers on the ECU. Verify 
that it's a Calif. ECU. Someone could have thrown anything in there. If I 
was you, I would buy both the harness and the ECU. One day, years from now 
hopefully, you will be glad you did and have an extra ECU for testing and 
use.

Find them here: http://www_dot_campbellnelsonvw_dot_com/ (nothing on the website 
about the used dept.) So try the 800 number and ask for the used parts 
dept.  Great source for motors or turnkey complete engines, trannys, ECU's, 
cabin plastic whatsits, from insurance totaled chassisesisses for all 
VW/Porsche/Saab. Tell'em I sent ya.
