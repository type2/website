Subject: List status and back digests

The list is slowly coming back up to speed.  Until it does, I ask that you
go easy and don't expect that everyone is getting your posts.

During the outage, many people were unsubscribed because their domains
were cut off and the list then &quot;bounced&quot; mail to them until their bounce
limit was exceeded.  They were then removed from the list.  This evening
I will try to merge the current subscriber list and an archive copy from
August 8th, before all this began.  I will then substitute this merged
copy for the current subscriber list, so that those people are brought
back on board.

In the mean time, thanks to Jan Willem Brier who was among the last to be
cut off, I have posted copies of the recent digests to my FTP site.  Go
to:

ftp://ftp.ari_dot_net/users/dworkin/

and gorge yourself on the digests you may have missed :-)

Glad to be back!!!!

In theory, there is no difference between theory and practice. 
But, in practice, there is.
