Subject: Fixed!!!!!!! '77 westy FI 1/2tank/full tank

Hey All,
Today I fixed the '77 westy full/half tank problem!!!!!!!!

A big thank you to Michael Shiffer for helping with the proper hose
setup for my bus.

The problem was..
The gas tank venting system which on a '77 bus is two metal tubes that
run from either side of the engine compartment and come together above
the fan for the interior heater into a single rubber hose, this hose had
been &quot;T&quot; into the vacuum system that runs from the de-acceleration valve
and the fuel pressure regulator, thus it was causing an enormous vacuum
in the tank as well as reducing the needed vacuum to those regulators. 
I have connected the hoses to their proper connections and she idles
like a charm, I went and filled the tank up crossing my fingers and
saying a prayer to the VW aircooled gods, and it runs fine no problem. 

Now I know this in retospect seems so obvious, but 2 weeks ago had
someone mentioned a vacuum hose to me I would have gone inside and
checked the &quot;Electrolux&quot; :) The good part about this problem was that I
have learned a great deal about my engine and how it works!

Thanks to all whom have offered suggestions and help! I was about to
give up today and take it to the shop, and it feels so great to have
been able to solve it with all your help. 
Peace,
scoob
