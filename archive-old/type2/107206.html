Subject: Re: [T2] poptop doesn't latch down tightly?

One of them did not work, the wire that wraps around that bend was missing. 
I replaced it though, and it still does the same thing. Maybe I should just 
take both of the braces off and see if I can latch it down tight without 
them in place once. From what I remember, they were a real B8tch to remove 
though. I don't remeber why, but im sure I will soon enougn.

Yes, mine just latches in the center, and that is all.

&gt;You've just got the one center catch in the front, right?
&gt;
&gt;Earlier bays had a rubber thingie with a ball end that slipped into a
&gt;retaining bracket.
&gt;
&gt;Sounds like maybe one of your hinges is sprung?
