Subject: more newbie questions about purchase
Message-Id: &lt;3.0.6.32.19990622141734.00835d90_at_artsci.wustl_dot_edu&gt;

I've received a lot of mail from folks re. advice purchasing a 
non-running '77 westy for &lt;$1600. If I haven't yet contacted you 
privately, thanks much all for the advice.  

I am looking for a local air-cooled mechanic to go look at it with
me to thoroughly inspect it, and maybe even hook up a carb to 
see if that is really all it needs.  Other things sure-to-be-checked
are terminal rust, fuel lines, and exhaust system. It currently
has custom glass packs on it, and I want to make sure it'll pass
inspection. Current owner says since it is registered as an RV,
it doesn't have to pass Missouri emissions.

My questions are: can anyone verify the RV emission claim?
Can anyone suggest a mechanic in the St.Louis, MO area (I got a name
&gt;from the type-2 owners page, Wolfsburg I think.)
Other things to check out?

thanks kindly

Patrick
