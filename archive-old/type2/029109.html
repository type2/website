&gt;How do you remove the little window washer nozzles?

&gt;needle nose pliers (or weeny vice grips), pinch the tabs; twist 90 degrees
&gt;and push all in one motion. -  steve

Steve your hands must be small :-)

Since mine are so big the only way I could get the washer nozzles off was
from the front, the only bad thing is you will BREAK them upon removal
-( However if someone from the rear can push in on the tabs you might get
lucky?

The pattern of the metal where the nozzles snap into are like a +, you just
grab them from the front and twist 90 degrees as stated, however when you do
this from the front, you &quot;snap&quot; the retaining portion of the plastic.

The ones on my bus where badly oxidized and cracked so I didn't worry about
breaking them, however I think the originals where gray, the new ones I
bought are Black.

Hope this helps if you can't get to the tabs from the back!

Meredith
