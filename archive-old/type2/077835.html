Subject: Re: [T2] 2.0 Liter Engine for sale

&gt;'77 case. 1800 heads. Hydraulic valves. New camshaft. I built this engine
&gt;with TLC to last for years and years.

FWIW I'll mention to the list I recall intimately Joe building this beast and
indeed it was built with a lot of love and care.  It is certainly worth the
$550
even if you had to tear it down and put it in a new case.  Thing being is I
would be willing to bet you could get buy without doing it and without relying
on JB weld.  As I recall he blew the plug behind the fan, the little one there
on the short little galley that supplies the small crank bearing.  Thing about
that is that the drilling for the bearing is a bit (3/8&quot;) back the hole.
I'm not
saying it is a happy or ideal time to do so, but that is a real easy one to
tap
1/8-NPT I sort of recall you don't even have to drill it.  So my point is
someone
could drill out the JB to about 1/4&quot; depth, tap the thing 1/8 NPT, clean out
carefully with Q-tips, then crank the engine a few times and let about a pint
of oil spew out the hole and pretty much have 95% or better chance of nothing
getting into the system.  It's a thought anyway.  Joe spent a lot of time on
this engine, and aside for not tapping or peening the galleys I'm sure he did
a bang up job.  One could peen all the other galleys plugs as a just in case
measure before installing it.
