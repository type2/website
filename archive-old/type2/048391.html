Subject: Re: [T2] Gas in oil, please help (long)

I would check to see if you're injectors are leaking.  Hook up a fuel
pressure tester, start the pump running (start the engine and turn it
off), and then watch the fuel pressure.  If it's dropping or doesn't
hold for at least a half hour or more, that means your leaking gas
somewhere.  Now, whether that would leak into the case through the
cylinders, I can't say, but it's a good thing to check anyways..

&gt; howdy list!
&gt; 
&gt; my bus is a '77 with a 2.0L hyd. lifter FI engine.
&gt; 
&gt; i checked my oil last night before heading home and was surprised to find
&gt; that it was higher than it was last time i checked it. i checked it again,
&gt; and a 3rd time, same thing. I smelled it: smells like gas. I felt it, feels
&gt; kinda thin.
&gt; 
&gt; started as normal, 1st try, oil lite went right out (or as quick as it
&gt; always does, it takes 1/2 - 1 sec. for hyd. lifter to pump up), trip home
&gt; was uneventful.
&gt; 
&gt; I read up on the subject in the archives when i got home. much of the stuff
&gt; in there was for upright motors with mech. fuel pumps that are leaking, or
&gt; carbs that have a float prob or something. i have electric pump and FI.
&gt; 
&gt; it seems as though gas in the oil is caused by: 1) running rich  2)failed or
&gt; poor spark  3)poor rings.  I doubt i have poor rings as the motor is an AVP
&gt; rebiuld with &lt;3000 miles on it. I will do a compression test to verify
&gt; but....   I also read the fuel will even leak past new (good) rings if it
&gt; has washed the oil out of the cylinder because it's so thin.
&gt; 
&gt; I changed the oil this morning (to get the gas out) and took it for a spin
&gt; round the neighborhood. bus seemed to lack its usual pep. for some reason i
&gt; suspect the timing has somehow been retarded and is causing incomplete
&gt; combustion, which lets the fuel past the rings. i don't know how timing was
&gt; retarded, b/c i have pertronix, but i can't check it with the strobe b/c my
&gt; little bro left it in his beetle (which has no roof) out in the rain without
&gt; the car cover on. so the strobe doesn't work no more.
&gt; 
&gt; I also pulled all the plugs and they looked like the &quot;normal&quot; picture in the
&gt; Haynes book.
&gt; 
&gt; so here come the questions:
&gt; 1. will retarded timing lead to gas in the crankcase?
&gt; 2. should i also test the cold start injector for leakage? (hasn't worked
&gt; since i've has the bus)
&gt; 3. i should do a compression test with the engine warm, correct?
&gt; 4. should i take the bus to the local inspection station to have the exhaust
&gt; gases measured?
&gt; 5. can i tell if i have a rich mixture from the plugs? retarded timing??
&gt; they looked normal.
&gt; 6. what else haven't i thought of??
&gt; 
&gt; thanks all for any input
