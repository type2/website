Subject: Front curtains for my 1971 Westy (anyone repo these?)
Content-type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII

I just cleaned out a box of misc parts and found the entire set of curtains to
surround the front childs cot that gets installed above the front seats. 

These will be sold in the future, but what I would like to know before I sell
them if anyone has (re)produced these in different colors... like I see the
top awning material  is now being reproduced in different colors. I am
painting my bus and these will not fit the new color scheme. 

What I'd like to find is the exact replica of what I have but in a choice of
colors... before I let my PATTERNS go.... anyone know of a place that does
this, or may attempt it in the future.

Michael
