Subject: Muir Dip Stick Heat Test

I read a post from someone recently who mentioned that he did not think the
Muir dip stick test was an accurate way to tell if  your engine is running hot
if you have a type 4 engine.  I guess I have to agree with this.  My dip
stick only gets slightly warm and would have to go a long way to be too hot
to hold onto.
So either the test works and I have a really cool running engine (I hope)
or the test is not real reliable with the type 4 engine.
Any other opinions out there?  I hope it works because it is real easy
indicator.
Brett
