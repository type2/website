Subject: Flea market finds

Today was a Toy day... found 10 different V-dub toys including 4
matchbox dunebuggies from early '70s (found a NOS box for one of the
them at another vendor for $1), 2 Avon bottles (Blue Beetle, Clear blue
Dune buggy) $3 each, 2 type III fastbacks (red/orange w/solid wheels,
purple metallic w/&quot;superfast&quot; wheels), a 7&quot; two-tone green Fisher Price
dunebuggy w/fairly detailed engine and a majorette manx style
dunebuggy...

	VW Type II content: The vendor I bought most of the matchbox toys from
is bringing up 1/2 dozen or so Bus toys for me to look at next weekend.
Says he has some Corgi, Dinky, and several matchboxes...

	The vendor that has the '78 Type II manual (non-Bentley?)in the yellow
cover keeps going up in price... This week she was up to $16 for it (she
had offered it to me for $8 three weeks ago, when I was out of money)...
says lots of people are interested...!!  I told her &quot;not really, it was
just me for the last three weeks&quot;.

	Last but not least, I bought a fair condition cm/.001 dial vernier
caliper for $5 in the case...

	Spent under $50 for all the stuff I picked up today, so I'm pretty
pleased with myself. &lt;&lt;G&gt;&gt;

	Ya'll take care...
