Subject: removing the oil cooler from a 1978 CDN

Hi,

 

I am going to see if I can pull the oil cooler, or at least change the
engine side seal.

 

Perhaps I can just get away to move it and remove the old seals and put it
back into place because it runs on studs.

 

May I ask the list for any other thoughts?

 

Archive did not serve me well.

 

Alan
