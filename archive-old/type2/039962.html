.Curious about the lead from the
&gt;tempeture sensor which goes to a double connector one which goes into a
&gt;harnes and the other which grounds over these two metal canisters on the
&gt;left frount firewall, are they by chance the resistor ballast and the fuel
&gt;pump relay or the double relay,? I can't figure it out from my Haynes and
&gt;Muir.
