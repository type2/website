Subject: RMMW e-mail address

Hi. I thought I would post this as an FYI. Rocky Mountain Motorworks is
online. Its e-mail addresses are sales_at_motorworks_dot_com and
catalogs_at_motorworks_dot_com. I really like their catalog, but I personally
haven't ordered anything from them. My wife got a box from RMMW the other
day, but she won't tell me what's in it :0. All I know is that it is
smaller than a breadbasket. Could it be a Blumenvasen?????
