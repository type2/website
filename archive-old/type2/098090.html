Subject: Re: [T2] 1600 DP in a 73 Westy, how will it perform?

&gt; WHAT, are they crazy? For power and performance I would stay with the 2.0.
&gt; or is the engine blown?

If all you have is a 1600, it beats walking.

&gt; &gt;They are wondering though how the bus will do with that engine.
&gt;
&gt; one word... SLUG

My '71 resents your epithet.  It prefers the term &quot;stately&quot;.

1600s push buses very nicely.  No, not a performance engine, but there is
no VW engine that will give a bus &quot;high performance&quot;.
