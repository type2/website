Subject: Re: [T2] what dual carbs for a T4 2. liter

&gt;Dells, Webbers, Kadrons, solexes?????

I'd advise against Dells because parts are difficult to come by 
(at least for the DRLAs).

&gt;What size???

For a stock 2-liter I wouldn't go larger than 40's.  If you are 
more economy-minded, 36's.

&gt;What type is better on gas mileage???

Solex (stock)

&gt;What will help my motor run cooler???

Hard to say - probably not much difference assuming they are 
jetted correctly.

&gt;I want to keep my vacuum dizzy, will this matter???

All the better.

&gt;Who is a recommended retailer????

CB Performance.

&gt;I also want to be able to pull a &quot;Gregg Potts&quot; style trailer.

Just keep a close watch on your engine temps.  If you don't have 
gauges, get them.

-David
