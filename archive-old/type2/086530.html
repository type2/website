Subject: Re: [T2] mist valve

The mist valve is NLA. You have to buy the whole wiper switch to get the
mist valve.

Subject: [T2] mist valve


&gt;
&gt; Hello folks,
&gt; Does anyone know were I can find the mist valve (the valve that screws to
&gt; the wiper switch for the windshield washer fluid). Mine is shot. I've
looked
&gt; on the web but can't seem to find a source. The only catalog that even
&gt; mentions it is Rocky Mountain Motor Works but they do not have any in
stock.
&gt; Thanks -Darin
