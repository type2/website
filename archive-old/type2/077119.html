Subject: help!  CV/axle replacement ?'S

hello listmembers......

so i have a new axle w/cv's to replace the bad one, and having trouble with 
getting the hex nuts off.... the 7/32 one isn't a tight enough fit (which 
common sense along with Bently says is important) and the 1/4 is too big. I 
don't have anything in between in my tool kit, so i'll need to get something 
to fit this b4 things close for the day, if at all possible...

its a 76 westy, and im fairly certain this is the original CV/axle because 
it seems like it's going to be a real bastard just getting those nuts off 
even if i do have the correct size hexnut tool...

any tips on getting these things off or the correct sized hexnut tool would 
be more than appreciatted.

I did get one tip from someone saying that if it clicks when i turn right, 
it would be the left rear one thats bad and vise versa, but after looking at 
them a little more, i know its the right rear making noise when i turn right 
because i can grab the cv at the transmission and turn it just a little 
while it is still completely connected, and if i grab the axle and slide it 
back and forth a hair, it makes noise...

anyone see any other issues i may need to address by that cv moving slightly 
(by trying to turn it, not sliding the axle) that will need to be addressed 
b4 installing the rebuilt one?


thanks again,

Christopher
76 westy &quot;jasper&quot;
