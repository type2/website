Subject: Refinished the pop-top

Washed/scrubbed it down with undiluted commercial film and scum remover, 
made by Cardinal Chemical Corporation in Toledo, Ohio.  $18/gallon. Used 
stiff nylon bristle scrub brush and wore rubber gloves. Took about 4 hours, 
with lots of rinsing off of the ground up lichens. The next day, after it 
dried, it was very white and clean, but obviously in need of another top 
coat. You could see the fine white whiskers of fiberglass, raised by the 
scrubbing.

I sanded the whole top on day two, then masked everything below the pop-top.

I bought a quart of Petit marine topside epoxy off-white at WalMart for 
$20, and applied it with a short nap roller, followed by brushing to smooth 
out the thick spots and lines. Took about two hours of actual painting. The 
top already had a good gel coat, so I didn't use any undercoater. Drying 
time at 75 degrees was about three hours to &quot;no longer tacky to touch.&quot; 
Actual time to recoating is listed at 8 hours.

This looks so good that I just had to tell about it. Been putting it off 
for about 10 years.
