Maybe the pump switch in the first air box (pin 36 and 39 ) would not close 
and the pump was dead. Then you turned the pump on with the second box.

&gt;Hi All,
&gt;
&gt;Thanks to everyone who offered suggestions on things to try. I'm going to 
&gt;list what finally worked for me here, as well as for the benefit of the 
&gt;archive, a summary of the advice that I got that would be good things to 
&gt;try for this kind of problem.
&gt;
&gt;When I was playing with the bus earlier and going through some of the tests 
&gt;that were recommended, I pulled off the connector to the AFM and started up 
&gt;the engine. I was just curious as to how it would run. It is common 
&gt;knowledge, that a bus will idle with the AFM disconnected, although you 
&gt;certainly can't drive it like that. Anyway, with the AFM disconnected, the 
&gt;bus idled normally. I'm not sure that this proved anything, but...
&gt;
&gt;Over the years I have collected some spare FI parts. I put in my spare Air 
&gt;Flow Meter. I wasn't expecting it to work. I figured I would connect the 
&gt;AFM without the air box and push the little door part with my finger to see 
&gt;if simulating extra air would do anything. To my surprise, putting in the 
&gt;spare AFM made the bus idle normally. So, I mounted it properly to the air 
&gt;box and installed it, then I was able to turn the idle screw back in to a 
&gt;normal level and achieve a proper idle.
&gt;
&gt;I'm not sure if this is because the new AFM is &quot;good&quot; and the old one 
&gt;&quot;bad&quot;, or whether this is just a rich AFM which is compensating for a yet 
&gt;to be discovered vacuum leak or low fuel pressure (as Karl suggested). It 
&gt;is strange, because it was my impression that AFM's usually fail rich as 
&gt;their springs weaken over time. I think I may swing by Lou's on Monday and 
&gt;&quot;borrow&quot; a fuel pressure reading and a vacuum reading.
&gt;
&gt;For now, I am a happy camper. Tomorrow the bus gets its first oil change, 
&gt;and I attempt to fix the couple of oil leaks that AVP provided free with 
&gt;the engine.
&gt;
&gt;---
&gt;For the benefit of the archive.. some other things that I checked based on 
&gt;advice from the list:
&gt;
&gt;  -Plugged up openings in the S tube to isolate against an air leak going 
&gt;though one of those other tubes. I used rubber stoppers I bought at the 
&gt;local corner hardware store. I also plugged off the tube that feeds the 
&gt;brake booster &amp; decel valve.
&gt;  -Checked ground connections of several wires which connect under the 
&gt;intake air distributor. I did this by feeling with my fingers not by 
&gt;disassembling everything.
&gt;  -Checked that wires were connected to sensor which is under the cold 
&gt;start valve.
&gt;  -Made sure AFM (Air Flow Meter) is plugged in. (Note that this sounds 
&gt;obvious, but I have done it before. This usually causes the bus to idle 
&gt;normally, but will want to die if you increase throtttle.)
&gt;  -Blocked off EGR. Since I put in a new EGR valve, I put a piece of gasket 
&gt;paper under where it connects to the Air Distibutor to isolate that some 
&gt;air was not leaking in somehow through the EGR.
&gt;  -Verified connection to temp sensor #2 (in cyl head near #3 cylinder).
&gt;  -Check fuel pressure. (This advice from Karl, I intend on following on 
&gt;Monday)
&gt;  -Check vacuum at port between #1 and #2 cylinders. Should be 15&quot; or so at 
&gt;idle.
&gt;  -Adjusting the spring in the AFM.
&gt;  -Use the Bosch L-Jetronic Troubleshooting manual (This is hosted in a 
&gt;couple of places, and linked to in the Library)
&gt;  -Of course, sprayed LOTS of carb cleaner over every hose, intake 
&gt;manifold, fuel injector, etc. to see if I could detect a change in idle.
&gt;
&gt;Happy Bussin'
&gt;
&gt;Mark
