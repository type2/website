ok...this might be a dumb question...but I looked around and really
couldn't find exaclty what I wanted...

my westy interior tag says &quot;SO 67&quot; then it says &quot;19 63&quot; on the lower
part....of course it says westfalia and some other german stuff but what
do these numbers mean?
my VIN is 2212175489
I don't know if this is original westy....

and why don't the panels from a 70 bus fit on a 71??? the panels that go
onto the back of the metal seat supports.....where the handle and vent
is...
the handle fits....but the panels have different clips in different
spots...is this normal?
