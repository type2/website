Hi Folks,

I replaced the clutch on my new 70 westy this past weekend. The shifting
fork was busted, so I had to take the one from my other 70 to fix it. All
went well and I am eager to drive the bus, but I have no brake lights. I
have searched the archive and now have a few things to look for, but I am
confused about one thing. My horn does not work either. According to some
posts, this is part of the same circuit as the brake lights. Am I correct to
think this? Anyone out there have an idea of where to start looking at this,
besides the pressure switches?

Any and all help appreciated,

Jeff
