Subject: RE: [T2] DEAD BUS*?$_at_! HELP

First of all, what is your name? Oohvwbus_at_aol_dot_com?

Second tell us more about you bus. Specifically the engine. What is it?

When you say it died and then said that it had no power that sounds like it
started again?

Is the starter motor turning over ok (meaning the battery is cool)?

&gt;When my bus gets hot, as in runs  for a while,
&gt; it idles rough and wants to stall out.  Well, yesterday it
&gt; stalled and died!
&gt; there is no power what so ever.  I just replaced my voltage
&gt; regulator, and
&gt; had it test at shmucks.  and everything was good.  This is my
&gt; everyday ride,
&gt; so any help you may give would be VERY appreciated.  I called a
&gt; couple places
&gt; here localy and they told two diffrent thing and contridicted each other
&gt; telling me the other was wrong. So now i am really confused!!
