Subject: Re: [T2] Snow tires...was[T2] re: Tire twist

&gt; I agree with Robb that they really improve the handling of a bus and are
better in adverse weather than &quot;normal&quot; tires.  Maybe the best you can buy
in that respect.  They won't, however, make your one-wheel-drive bus into a
Jeep.  I still managed to get stuck on some wet grass on the side of the
road once.  Very embarassing.

This is odd.  I have found my bus to be next-to-impossible to stick, even in
a foot-deep sticky mudbog that stopped three 4WD American trucks cold!  When
it snowed the other day, I noticed that when I spun the tires, I left two
tracks, not one.  Is there any chance that this vehicle has got a
limited-slip??  Or am I just lucky?  Is a limited-slip availible for the Bus
tranny?  Unfortunately, my tranny is making odd whining noises, so I may be
looking at a rebuild or a fresh unit sometime soon.  Any advice on good
rebuilders, components, or whatever else?  I'd like to maximize my off-road
ability, as I take the Bus on rock-climbing expeditiions (me climbing, the
Bus just getting me there) which require some traction.  TIA!
