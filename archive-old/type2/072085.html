&gt;Dear list-
&gt;	there was a guy a few days back that had a Toyota engine in the back of
&gt;his bus.  I cannot remember his name but it was painted like a cow.  He
&gt;got me thinking about my 69 bus, well my question is this.  I have a
&gt;buddy with an olds 350 with the tranny off an 84 buick Rivera.  I know of
&gt;some company that sells conversion kits to convert almost anything.  Does
&gt;anybody know what company this is?  I really wanna do this!  Can anybody
&gt;give me any constructive advice on this.   Also can I use the tranny off
&gt;the Rivera?  It was a front wheel drive car.  Any advice would be greatly
&gt;appreciated.  Thank you.  And to make the idea even more appealing, he
&gt;doesn't want anything for it.  I just have to pull it out of the car.
&gt;The car was in a wreck.  Thanks in advance.

I've seen this done on a single cab PU before in Colorado.  The guy really
had fun with it pulling trailers around the mountains.  He said people had
a funny look on their faces when passed by an old split window bus pulling
a trailer up a mounatain grade.  You couldn't tell anything different about
the bus other than the air cleaner that stuck up above the floor of the bus.

But about the conversion, it is possible if you are a VERY EXPERIENCED
welder/fabricator with deep pockets.  The engine/tranny might be free, but
believe me, the little stuff will nickel and dime you to death.  Being an
auto mechanics, welding and machine shop instructor who has built numerous
hot rods, dune buggies and restorations, I can tell you with out a doubt
that you are looking at a minimum of 300-500 hours of designing,
fabricating, installing, testing, redesigning, refabricating and retesting
before you can do any body work to make the bus look good.

I don't want to discourage a creative mind, just want to let you know what
it will take before you get in too deep to recover your losses.
