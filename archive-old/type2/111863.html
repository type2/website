&gt; When you force the grease out aren't you just blowing out the seals by

No.  If you look at a seal off the car it will be angled to act as a
valve.  Grease can flow out without harming the seal but nothing can flow
in.

&gt; I was under the impression that there were grease seals to keep dirt
&gt; and water from getting into your torsion arms.

Correct in theory.  In practice nothing is perfect.

&gt; When you pump all this grease through there arent you just forcing the
&gt; seals to blow out thereby destroying your moisture/dirt barrier?

No. As I said above, the seal is supposed to be one-way.  Of course that
is in a perfect universe.  As a result you need to change your grease
occasionally in the same way that you change your oil occasionally to
remove the contaminated grease and replace it with fresh grease.  The
&quot;count the strokes&quot; method is quite good.  Pumping until you see new
grease flowing out is also good.

&gt; Also does the grease in a front end with good seals really go bad
&gt; under normal service?

Even in a perfect universe the grease in a front end is subject to intense
pressure from normal usage and does degrade over time.  In this universe
it is also subject to dirt and water contamination and to being squeezed
past the seals.

                             OOK!
