I called and reserved the area where we were last year at Blue Rocks 
Campground.  So we'll have the pavillion again and should be free from non-
Volksie people.  

You have until August 31 to reserve a site before they open it up to the 
general public.  I know some volks don't like to sign up until the week before 
when they know the weather, but if the area is full, you may be assigned a site 
in the hinterlands of the camground.

So call them and then send a 1 night's deposit check.  You can also e-mail me 
your info (Name, address, phone, number of people, number of nights) and I'll 
call, but you still have to send the check within 10 days.

It should be interesting how many folks come this year.  The first year we had 
8 vehicles, last year we had 32.  I hope this is not a geometric progression, 
but it would be fun to take over the campground like Transporters by the Tunnel 
does.  :-)  They'd certainly give us more free firewood then (last year they 
gave us a pickup-truck load full).
