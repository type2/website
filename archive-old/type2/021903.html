Hello to everyone from some small town in Colorado where the snow is in the 
mountain peaks, the streams run clear and cold, and I type as fast as I can in 
real time at this small library.

Casper is doing an average of 23.55 MPG over the course of our, so far, 3,000 
miles.
He took the great divide on highway 50 at 25 MPH in second gear and smoothly 
took us to 11,300 feet elevation as though it were a Houston overpass.

I have advanced his timing to the max, and get an occasional ping, only to 
wipe this destrctive noise out with a slight let-up on the gas pedal.

OK. ........
So I burned up a brand new Voltage Regulator,
and I got stuck in the middle of a stream when I had my fuel line plug from 
some dumb thing I did earlier.
And I nearly messed up the side door making &quot;fine tune&quot; adjustments to same.
This last problem was solved by a fellow bus person we met at the campsite who 
is a rocket scientist for NASA........ Go figure !!!

Small potatoes (or is it potatos ?) 
none of the problems have been Casper's fault.

Mary Beth is doing a wonderful job of Coleman stove meal cooking, and we are 
having more fun than we can even describe to each other. What a beautiful 
country we are seeing, and what a swell way to spend each and every night. I 
will give more details later, when we can obtain Internet access in something 
more than &quot;real time&quot; - type as fast as I can muster finger flying.

Gotta run.... I am radio active around the following frequencies of an 
evening.
14.200 +/-
18.140 +/-
I had a great 6 meter opening the other night while camping at 10,000 feet 
elevation........ What fun !
While I was on the radio, and Mary Beth was in the sleeping bag, a coon was in 
our cooler..... He got some great salami and cheese, the little masked bandit 
!

Our road songs have become........
AA)
&quot;Truck on a Cheese Wedge ,,,, Oh No !&quot;
The above sung to the rhytjm of &quot;shave and a haircut, 2 bits&quot;
Thos down hill runs are scary !!!!!!!!!!!!!
BB)
&quot;I am the Gawd of Campfire,,, and I bring you..... Fire&quot;
Sung to beat of an old favorite song of mine, while I die from smoke 
inhalation, the smell of burning hair on mya arms, and total memory lapse from 
my old eagle Scout learnings !!!!!

All in all....... We love life more than we have loved it ever.
Got Casper, our GPS, our 20 gigabyte MP3 player, our love for each other, and 
a fun time to full to ever think of having finished.

Peace,
Bob and Mary Beth, Casper,
and my tired fingers...... allotted time is up at the terminal.
