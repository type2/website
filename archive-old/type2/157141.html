Subject: [T2]brakes no pedal pressure

ok so i have replaced the master cylinder.... still heard a squuesh when bleeeding and found a hole in metal line and fixed that....

have done been around the vehicle at least 10 times now and went through 2 grat big huge bottles of brake fluid now trying to get the air out of al the lines...


i have finally gotten the air out it looks like but the pedal pressure is not there...
it will stop but you have to have the brake pedal to the floor..?

whats up here anyone...

how do i get the pedal pressure back or whats causing this..?

i have found no leaks and no more squeesh sounds...

somethings still not right... stops good when you push it and mash all the way to floor... but to scary to drive....

thanks
chai
