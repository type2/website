&gt; 2. I'll eventually stop waving at other bus drivers on the road, since
&gt; I don't think a steel shell alone constitutes a bus. I will treat other
&gt; buses as SUVs in drag, unless and until I'm sure that there is no
&gt; radiator, visible or hidden from view.


So your one of those people that doesn't wave at water cooled huh.  I am not
that way.  I am friendly to all VW owners.  I even wave at the New Beetles.
They seldom wave back but at least I am being friendly. In the long run,
when gas goes up to $20 + / gallon (and in the future, I am sure it will)
All gas operated vehicles will either have to be converted to run on
something else or be museum pieces as the world is running out of oil
whether you believe it or not.  The US already keeps gas prices low for
us.for how long who knows.  Look at every other country in the world and ask
how much they are paying for gas.  Europeans have been converting over to
LPG for years now.  If you know a way to make an air cooled run on something
other than gas I am all for listening.

And when and if I have problems with any part of the conversion, don't
worry, I won't waste this lists time, as I understand it is not the place
for it.  There are other more knowledgeable lists for those topics.  But to
say you won't wave at a water cooled bus is like the splitty people saying
they won't wave at bay windows.  Just not a nice attitude.  Can't we all be
friends.

Peace to all my VW Brothers and Sisters (air and water cooled),
Snoopy
