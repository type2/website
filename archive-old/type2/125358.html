Subject: Re: [T2] DOOR WINDOW REGULATOR

&gt;
&gt; the regulator is probably stripped and needs to be replaced.
&gt; not difficult but it can get a little tricky trying to manouver the bits
&gt; around inside the door.
&gt;
&gt; make sure its not just a stripped  handle before you order a new
&gt; regulator.

I'll second that last caveat, the first job I had to do on Tigger was
replace the window winder mechanism in the driver's door ( which is a real
pain, IMHO, BTW ), and recently it started slipping again and then suddenly
stopped working altogether.

I pulled the door panels off, planning to get the window closed and propped
up for security purposes, but when went to try getting it up with the winder
and a push, I found that the splines were all chewed out, replaced it with
the winder off the passenger door and everything's fine again, I thought
that it was a one off, possibly due to my fitting the winder incorrectly,
from Andy's note, it may be more common, and it's FAR easier and cheaper to
fix than replacing the winder mechanism, DEFINITELY try that first.

Good luck,
