Subject: fuel line replacement - won't start!

Right and right. I was running just fine.

Fuel pressure gauge read 32-35

Only 4 volts at fuel pump, cleaned contacts, got it up to 6. Connected fuel pump to a seperate 12v supply and she almost started.

I think my problem's somewhere around the double relay.

Any comments?
