Lets see if the mail filter bites me this time.

    The PCV valve basically controls the vacuum for sucking the
crankcase vapors
    from the engine into the intake manifold so it can be burned with
the air/fuel
    mixture.  Old cars just vented this outside.  The breather for the
engine is
    actually an air cleaner for the air drawn into the engine, remember
the
    vacuum.  I don't believe that it can relieve pressure, only suck in
air.  If
    the PCV valve gets clogged, no vacuum, so crankcase pressure will
develop.

    The valve should be in the small rectangular box piece held down
with a wire
    bale, like a small version of the rocker cover hold down.  It is on
the top
    rear of the engine, same location as the 914 oil filler.  The valve
should be
    located there if I'm not mistaken, I could be wrong as it's been a
while since
    I've worked on a newer bus.  If anything follow the large 3/8'' ID
vacuum hose
    from the intake manifold out and you should find it.  Better yet
take a look
    at your Haynes manual, should have it in there.

    Hope this helps

   &gt; &gt; Harry - this may be my magic silver bullet - where is this PCV
valve and
   &gt; &gt; what does PCV stand for?  I have the same exact problem as Bob -
on a 2.0L
   &gt; &gt; FI engine ....
