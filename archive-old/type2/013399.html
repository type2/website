Listers:

I am, by constitution, of the cut once, measure twice school but trying to go against the internal hard-wiring. So, when I began to replace the graunchy sounding front wheel bearings. I discovered, after removing the old races, 
that I had not measured the depth to which the outer race of the inner bearing should be driven/pressed. 

Further, Bentley doesn't specify, nor does Haynes. Muir simply tells me to have the dealer press the races in. Checked the archives and library - no mention of the depth. Was told to listen to the tone of the impact sound - 
that tone changes from &quot;thud&quot; to &quot;boing&quot; when the race is seated. 

That worked on the outer bearing race since it butted up against a shoulder. But no shoulder on the inner bearing outer race. Does anyone know the depth to which to drive it? Or any other solution?

Many thanks,
