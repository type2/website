Subject: Vans for sale, dayton, oh

Greetings-

I have to following vans in various conditions that I will need to part with due to
a probable move in the next  month. All will very likely need to be towed. 

1971 Bus, burnt valves- engine needs rebuild, Solid body, Steering is tight. Orange 
and white; I have a 1969 westy interior (bed, cabinet, sink) included that will
need to be installed. Front panel has been pushed in.

1972 High-roof adventure wagon. In good shape, needs new clutch. Steering is some
of the best I've seen in a bay window van. White- previous owner drove into a low-
clearance parking garage, so the fiberglass roof will need some work, and the wooden
interior panels in the roof need to be recut out of new material due to water damage.
Solid, a bit of surface rust under a coat of paint. Front panel has been pushed in.

1985 Wasserboxer. Overheated, so a rod is now knocking and the engine will
need to be rebuilt. Previous to that ran great.  Blue/grey weekender.

I expected to have more time to restore these, but, well.. those best laid plans, you
know. 

I have pictures available- I will send the web page address upon request.

Ciao,
Laura
