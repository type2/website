There are several different brands, but I only have experience with Porta
Potti.  Before you buy go to an RV store and check out several.  Controls
and dumping provision vary widely, so check them carefully.  For a few
bucks more you can get a &quot;marine&quot; model toilet from a boat supplier that
is supposedly longer lasting.

&gt; Hi all,
&gt; 
&gt;      I will be ripping up my bathroom floor this weekend. (what fun)  Since
&gt; we only have one bathroom, I figured this would be a good time to get a
&gt; porta potti for camping.  Is the Porta Potti brand a good one or is there
&gt; something better for under $100?  I am looking for any opinions on this as I
&gt; will buy something tomorrow.  Thanks.
