&amp;gt; on the most recent VW that I put back together,
&amp;gt; the heat riser tube ends wouldn't get close enough
&amp;gt; to the exhaust to bolt up.

&amp;gt; I looked through my box of parts and found
&amp;gt; blockoffs for the exhaust.  I cut the heat
&amp;gt; riser tube ends off the intake manifold with a
&amp;gt; sawzall and blocked the exhaust.

This will work fine except for loss of drivability and icing on cool, high
humidity days.  There was a reason for those heat risers!

Most of the time, difficulty in mating the exhaust is due to cheap Mexican
mufflers, or a previous mating attempt with such mufflers.  The higher
quality Leistritz mufflers are well worth the money, both in ease of
installation, longevity, and in not screwing up your heat risers!
