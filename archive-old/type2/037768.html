Subject: Re: GL4 gear oil

After seeing this thread, I checked my bottle of gear oil...yep, GL5.
Guess I'll be draining and refilling the tranny this weekend. FYI, I had no
trouble finding GL4.....went to the local NAPA store ( for those of us in
the US) Sta-Lube was $8.49/gallon, and $5.00 for a handy dandy pump. Hope
this helps someone.

PS going to look at a possible stable mate this weekend, a 66 beetle...does
anyone know of a similar list for type 1's? TIA
