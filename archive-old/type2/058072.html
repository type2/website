Don't know if cutting holes in the tin would work.  I would be very wary of
tightening only the lower head bolts.  It is possible (though not easy) to
remove the top tin with the engine in the bus and tighten the top bolts too
- that's what I would do.  Were the bottom ones really loose?  If not, it
suprises me that tightening them would stop the leak.

When the engine was put together it should have had sealant applied to the
base of the cylinders to prevent leaks.  If this was not done, the only
real solution is taking the motor back apart, cleaning the base of the
cylinders and putting the sealant in.  This is a lot of work (Probably 8
hours for someone that knows what they're doing) so if the leak is bearable
I'd just live with it until rebuild time.
