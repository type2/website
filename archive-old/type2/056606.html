I oughta let Sean answer this but I can't resist.  The injectors fire
(are grounded) every time a spark plug fires.  They deliver 1/4 of a fuel
charge with each opening.  Remember that the charge is not being delivered
to the cylinder directly, but to the back of the intake valve, there to be
vaporized while cooling the intake valve (which is why intake valves
*never* drop). The full charge is then drawn in to the cylinder during the
intake stroke. When the fuel is delivered matters not a whit to the
engine, as long as it is sucked in at the correct time.

In theory, there is no difference between theory and practice. 
But, in practice, there is.
