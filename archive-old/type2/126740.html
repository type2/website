Subject: steering gearbox leaking,popping

The steering gearbox in my 1971 Westy is slightly leaking and makes popping 
noises (sometimes) when I turn the steering wheel.. It does not seem to be 
affecting the bus to much. I do not want to spend the money to fix it right now , 
unless I really have to.
This is the only flaw in my Westy, So it kind of bugs me.
Any advice on the steering gearbox , and it`s availability will be 
appreciated. This is my main source of transportation, It would not be convenient for me 
to have my bus break down and have to wait a long time to find parts. For 
this reason I may not mind doing some preventative repairs.

Thank You
Vincent Moreno
