Hi Volks,
A friend just called me to let me know that he was visiting his in-laws and
low and behold a neighbor has a 64 bus that has been sitting behind the house
for many  many years. Anyway he says its in rough shape but i still want to go
check it out. To the extent its to-far-gone are there any particularly rare
parts that i should look to salvage??
