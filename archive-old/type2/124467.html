Subject: Re: [T2] Getting that darn fan off

As Richard said, getting the fan off is no big deal, but removing the hub is
a little bit harder.  First, of course, you remove the large bolt and
washers that thread onto the end of the crank and hold the hub in place.  As
for removing the hub from the crank itself, I've always used the technique
of &quot;walking&quot; it off using the fan bolts pressing against the thickest pieces
of steel I can slide between the hub and case.  (I use big washers that just
barely fit between the hub and case.)  You just go 'round and 'round
tightening the fan bolts the barest amount - maybe a 16th or 32nd of a
turn - and that hub will pop right off.

The large bolt and washers that thread onto the end of the crank will serve
as your &quot;press&quot; to get the hub back on; a flywheel lock is real convenient
here so you can get the correct torque on that bolt without the crank
spinning on you.

&gt; &gt;I am having trouble removing the fan from my Type IV engine.
&gt; &gt;I want to replace the engine seal behind it to stop a leak.

&gt; The fan easily comes off with 3 bolts. The harder part is removing the
hub. There was a plate used as a tool to press the hub off using the fan
bolts. Bentley has a photo. How are you going to remove the hub and press it
back on?
