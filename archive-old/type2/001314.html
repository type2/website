Hello volks,

I am working on getting my charcoal canister set up to vent my fuel lines on my 74 Westy, 1800cc.  I am in need of the pipe that comes out of the left side of the fan housing that goes to the canister.  Mine is missing and is currently plugged.  If anyone hase one of these, let me know how I can aquire it from you.

Thanks,
Ed Woenker
