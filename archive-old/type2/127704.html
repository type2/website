Subject: [T2]goodbye Cali emissions setup?

my bus was a cali bus and has the setup for cali emissions.
how can i get away from this the less expensive way?not cheap
my muffler is shot and i am constantly fixing holes around my heater boxes.
how can i get away and say goodbye from this all.
i cant so this yet but it is something that is a must when the cash and time is right.
anyone got diagrams or pics of something nicer and cleaner?
also how does if it does the muffler and such play a role in gas milage or is that sort of old folk lore?
thanks
peace
chris
