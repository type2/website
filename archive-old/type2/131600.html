Subject: RE: [T2] valve clatter

&gt;From: Kafertoys

&gt;1700 in a 72  westy and the valves clatter even after adjustment. I'm not 
&gt;an
&gt;expert on T-4 engines and looking for any and all reasons so I can start
&gt;ripping it down I hope not out.


Confucious says: One who claims not be an expert, has good opinion. =D.

Joking aside, you said you are not an expert on the type IV. I am not 
either, but I know how to adjust the valves. I also know how not to adjust 
them. First things first, are you absolutely sure you did it correctly?
