&gt; Try Engineer's Pass from Lake City to Ouray.  God's
&gt; country! Made it to the top with only 3 cylinders (bad
&gt; spark plug connector).

Never had a problem with any pass, but it seems that the climb out of
Needles on I-40 going west is the longest one.

We've been over quite a few tall ones in my stock 1600 '71, including some
very high passes on dirt roads in Colorado.  With gears you can climb
anything!

Strange you should mention the spark plug connector.  I had one go bad on
the way to BBB.  Kept blowing off of #1.  A quick stop at the flaps and
all was well again.
