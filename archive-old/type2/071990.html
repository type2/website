On the advice of my mechanic, I have switched from 89 octane to 92, and,
depending on the &quot;gas wars&quot;, sometimes 94.  ( You can't purchase leaded gas
in Canada, to my knowledge...)

I have noticed more jump in acceleration, and the bus seems to run
smoother.  No adjustments have been made.
