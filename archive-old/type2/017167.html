Subject: Trip Report - Jack Maynard

I received a postcard from listmember Jack Maynard a couple of days ago.  Jack
and his bride Kelli are enjoying an extended tour of Baja and Mainland Mexico
in Eugene the Green (a '66 converted hardtop Westy).  He asked me to forward
it to the &quot;lists&quot;, so...

Jimbo,

Down here scouting locations for WetWesties trips.  Lots of great camping &amp;
really not that terribly far away.  I have signed up a few potential new
listees for all four lists.  Have seen several splits, nothing remarkable, a
couple of bays including an Adventurewagen hi-roof style, '71 who's owners we
camped with a few days on Bahia Conception. And tons of broke Vanagons!

The bus is running fantastic, the weather is very nice.  We are currently
camped about 60km north of Cabo in the mountains at a really cool ranch.  The
locals are wonderful people and would welcome a caravan of old buses.  The
beer is cheap &amp; cold &amp; dee-lish!  

Please post this to all the lists!

Jack + Kelli
