I finally got my fuel problems all solved.  Now my transmission is playing 
tricks on me. (I have a 72 Westy with 1700 Pancake) Sometimes it wont let me 
go into any gear except reverse.  Many times trying downshift into 2nd it 
grind nice and load since it is going into reverse instead of 2nd.  i DO know 
how to drive standard so its not me, is my clutch worn out? i dont think so.
