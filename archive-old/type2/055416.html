Subject: RE: Failed Emissions (but got a *valid* test! :-)

I'm still not able to post directly to the list but I receive it.  Sent
this post off yesterday re: Dolans problems but it didn't register on the
list and I haven't heard from Dolan.  Could you please forward it to the
list for me.

Tnx

To Steve Dolan and the list:

Hi Steve

This looks familiar.!

&gt;OK, round 2 in the emissions wars.  I took it back up, and at least it
&gt;i&gt;dled well enough that a valid test was performed.  Now... I can either
&gt;ta&gt;ke it to a certified facility and get it repaired, spend $300, and get a
&gt;waiver, or... I can actually fix it :-)  I would perefer to actually fix
&gt;the damn thing if I can.

&gt;Results of the test:
             Idle                       2500RPM
        Limit    Reading  result    Limit    Reading  Result
HC ppm   600      1961    Fail       600      161     Pass
CO %     6.00     8.32    Fail       6.00     6.11    Fail
        RPM        983    VALID     RPM       2494    VALID
        Dilution  16.2    VALID     Dilution  16.7    VALID

I'm surprised the test is this easy.  3% CO is the limit here.  Look
carefully at the cold start injector.  To be that rich at idle its getting
a hell of a lot of gas.  Then check your sparks plugs.  Its possible that
one or more injectors is peeing on an injector thus making it hard to fire.
Are you getting white smoke out the back?


&gt;Now, the main querstion is &quot;What's wrong???&quot;  I *think* it is running rich
&gt;as all get out (but see the last paragraph).  I can twist the AFM's tail
&gt;to lean it a bit, but I have a feeling that one cylinder is not firing too
&gt;well.

A few questions first:
Is this a stock, un altered AFM and ECU?  (what # AFM)
Have you checked you cold start injector for constant running?
Have you pulled the injectors to check for constant running and pattern.
What do the plugs look like?
Do you have a hall effect timing gun?   (check each wire for spark)
What year harness do this unit have and does it possibly have an altitude
switch.

This looks like the problem I was having tow years ago.  After going
through the entire system ( and I mean every thing) I found the altitude
switch was in the wrong setting.  I haven't found any one else with this
harness and switch but Its possible you have a short somewhere in the
harness simulating the effect of the switch. Shorting our the AFM circuit
thus the ECU sends a rich mixture.

Also check the Temp sensor # 2 for correct ohm values and tightness
(corrosion free)


&gt;So far I have set the dwell and timing, and cleaned up some vac leaks.
&gt;Also set the idle speed and checked compression (which is fine)

This would make you lean.  You are way rich.

&gt;I just got my intake boots and will install them and the new runner to
&gt;head gaskets today.  I then intend to replace the spark plug wires, spark
&gt;plugs (to take care of any possible failure in the wires/plugs).  What
&gt;else?  I can check and adjust the AFM a bit, but I don't think I will get
&gt;a 2/3rd reduction in HC at idle with only that.

Don't change the AFM wheel whithout marking the original location.  Did you
ever put a O2 sensor on this unit?

&gt;Also, what the heck are the HC and CO measuring?  HC is hydrocarbons,
&gt;which is unburned gas and says I am running rich, but CO is carbon
&gt;monoxide, which would seem to indicate that I need more oxygen i.e. I am
&gt;running too lean.  It can't be both!!!!


If you graph CO and HC by fuel mixture you get the following:

Connect the dots and you can see the relationship between CO and HC.  Your
situation of low HC and HIgh CO means to me &quot;way to rich&quot; , like one of
your 5 injectors is stuck open.

Let me know what is happening.

Have fun
