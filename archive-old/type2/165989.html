Subject: Re: fitting the SVDA and 2L questions

hmm.

Gold label on the cast-in breather box:

&quot;EXCHANGE
PIECE REMISE A NEUF
071 100 031AX

MAY BE USED FOR ENGINE CODE: CV&quot;

Book says 80-83 vanny?

case also has a goldish-tinted coating.

i found this:
http://www.ratwell_dot_com/mirror/sfraser/techbull.html

(thank you mr. atwell)

These are not square-port heads, but i guess they are
FI - I pulled a clipped CHT sensor out of the driver's
side head to get the tin off.

So...its a vanny shortblock with a 2L bus top end?

Heads are rebuilt though - valve bosses are welded up
and &quot;SIR&quot; is stamped into the rockerbox.

Also - there was a shim between the cylinder and the
head. Maybe this is the 1.6mm shim (no , still havent
found the calipers) mentioned in the whitepaper...but
it is on the head-side rather than under the cylinder?
 They are rebuilt, though - so the step is machined
out...so the shim is compensation for that i guess.

Maybe i'll add the 1.6mm shims under the cylinders in
addition to the head/cylinder shims.
Maybe their absence is increasing CR slightly...which
explains 'running hot' - at least partially?

Can't hurt to lower the CR a bit on a big ol' bus
engine running a weber progressive with those FI
heads...


I know there is a lot of data missing here and that i
should CC the heads.

I'm just posting findings and soliciting list wisdom
on this franken-engine.

oh - and - any thoughts on the SVDA question - do i
have to re-orient anything? The notch on the 009
points towards #3...or #4...sort of between them.

TIA, 
Clark
