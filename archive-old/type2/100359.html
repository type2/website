Subject: Bus has trouble turning over when cold

Hello,

I have a 70 bus w/a rebuilt (by me) 1600cc single-port.  Recently, it has 
been difficult to start when its cold (sitting overnight - overnight temps 
appox 35F).  It doesn't matter if I try to start it in the morning or in the 
afternoon.  Usually it takes 2-3 tries to get it to fire, then die,  then 
another couple tries after that.  After it has started, I have to keep my 
foot lightly on the accelerator pedal for a few minutes until I can release 
it to complete its warm up.  I have a new carb, a 32 Pict 3, I believe, 
along with the rebuild.

Any ideas would be apprecaited!
