&gt;I'm working with them now and want to get your opinions as to what kind of
&gt;organization they run?

WCM makes many (most) of the little rubber gizmos and seals which are busy 
rotting off your bus, and which VW Corp. no longer cares enough to make
available.  Whether you buy from them directly or not, you will most likely be
buying their products.  In my experience, I have found that often (usually) some
other supplier will have the WCM products cheaper than if you bought direct.
