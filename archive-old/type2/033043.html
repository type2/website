Subject: Exhaust Coatings

 Hello All!

 Yesterday I recieved my extractor to go along with the single quiet pack
 muffler I ordered from RMMW.  I think that Ive heard bad things of Bugpack
 exhaust components in the past and unknowing to me, that is what RMMW sent
 me. 

 The problem is that on the extractor the black coating was flaking off onto
 my hands when I took it out of the box.  The muffler also had some of 
paint scraped off, but at least it wasnt sticking to my hands!

 Question: Anyone have a suggestion onto a high temp paint that I could 
 snag to recoat these things?

 I may even hit the heater boxes with the stuff as well.

 Thanks!
