Subject: flame bait bit--was Re: bus security (paranoids exposed)

Clara's original wise and worldly post:
&gt; &gt;have an ugly car.   Faded paint, a dent or two, tatty old curtains.    Leave
&gt; &gt;old pepsi bottles and food wrappers on the floor.   Some spare clothes, dirty
&gt; &gt;socks, some dog eared paperback, and empty cigarette packs.   Who'll want to
&gt; &gt;go in there, there wouldn't be anything worth while anyway.     Don't lock
&gt; &gt;it, and leave the key in the ignition.

Jonathan (fusion) replied thusly:
&gt;If you keep your bus lloking like shit, you obviously don't take a great
&gt;deal of pride in it, or respect for it...if you don't respect your bus,
&gt;then why do you subscribe to this list...?

&gt;OK,OK, enough...flame me if you must...go on!

See!  He begged for it! 8 )

I have done the following to my bug &quot;daily driver&quot; (I don't drive daily).
Installed NEW, not rebuilt but NEW, engine, rebuilt tranny, NEW complete
disc brake front end--EVERYTHING, replaced remainder of brake 
system, tires, hoses, cables, bearings, and shocks.  It is, in fact,
mechanically new.  I drive around with a complete set of Craftsman tools.

After all of this work and expense, I'd like to keep the car around.

So:

Exterior body--primer over former rust spots, except dented and
rusty fenders (have replacements when they rust away). Windshield
cracked and hit by hammer (legacy of PO).   I wash it every ten years,
but since I've only had it for five, I've got another five to go. 8 )  

Interior--basic gutted look, no passenger seat, no rear seat (plywood
shelf for hauling stuff) [this is my parts hauler], piece of politician
sign cardboard covering radio hole in dash (replacing junker tape
deck), tool box and spare parts hidden under rear package shelf.

Nobody would think of breaking into or stealing this car, but I lock it
anyway to keep citizens from dumping their trash in it.

No pride?  No respect?  Sir, you offend my sensibilities.....I throw
down my gauntlet!

 .....be on the road in no time (yah, I know, but I really mean
        it this time)

 Rick (Fabulous)        And the politicians are throwing stones
 '70 Westy                      So the kids they dance they shake their bones
 &quot;The Carcass&quot;           Cause its all too clear we're on our own
