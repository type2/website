Hi Volks,

I'll counter Robt's advice with a missive defending FI.

Sure, we hear about lots of FI issues here... those buses are newer  
and there are probably more of them in service amongst list-members.  
And remember that in some municipalities carbs are not an option,  
since it is illegal to remove or modify emissions control equipment.

I converted my dual-carb bus to Bosch L-jetronic FI three years ago,  
and it has run MUCH better since. Dual-carbs  were always a dark  
science to me and keeping worn-out 30-year old carbs in adjustment  
just wasn't working. There is a dearth of air-cooled expertise in  
these parts, and I wanted better gas milage. Parts for them are hard  
to find, and dual-carb replacements for a type4 are not cheap. Single- 
carbs for type4's (weber) are renowned for poor running or economy.

At some time in the future I will probably upgrade to Megasquirt, but  
I wanted to gain familiarity with L-Jet beforehand.

Robt, your message was created and distributed using an &quot;unfixable  
black box&quot;, and EVERY single reader of it will also be using these  
same &quot;unfixable black boxes&quot; to read it. It's not like they're new or  
uncommon, and they are not unrepairable. You just need a different  
skill set and some more refined tools, is all.

Mark, Welcome back! I have a friend here in Toronto who is currently  
gathering up the bits to put L-Jetronic FI on his 68 westy. We will  
be sure to let the list know how it works out.


Happy Trails,

Greg Potts

&gt; 	Again, those involved are the experts; but my impression from  
&gt; trends in discussion on T2 since I recently joined this esteemed  
&gt; scene is that injectors give more frequent, and more difficult,  
&gt; trouble than carbs.
&gt; 	And could I plug anew my query about retrofitting VW 1600 - 2000  
&gt; with 2-barrel Nissan carbs off e.g their 1500 of the 1990s. This  
&gt; may be to the respected Weber 2-bbl what Honda was to NSU in  
&gt; motorbikes &amp; midget cars, late '50s onward.  I just got 14 y  
&gt; trouble-free performance ca.32mpg from a Nissan C22 vanette  -  
&gt; except for one clogged petrol filter which simulated the old rental- 
&gt; car speed limiter at 55 mph!
&gt; 	Injection was a main response to the Calif emissions-control  
&gt; thrust, based on a particular test protocol ascribing weights to  
&gt; idle, cold, and a few other variables.  Consigning more &amp; more  
&gt; emission control to computers has been a grave disaster IMHO.  I  
&gt; have fought it all the way.  A well maintained carb gives mpg and  
&gt; most emission controls, cruising warm, near enough to what  
&gt; computers can achieve, let alone what the bastards actually  
&gt; achieve.  A sensitive driver from cold will minimise emissions;  
&gt; bring back manual choke, say I  -  as well as excessive loads on  
&gt; bearings not yet fully lubricated during warmup.  Carburetting has  
&gt; been pretty civilised. The unfixable black box we must fight  -   
&gt; counterattack these daleks.
&gt; 	And plus you get: well developed water-injection (straight after  
&gt; the carb) halving CO &amp; unburnt fuel. That will suffice for any  
&gt; decent city with proper public transport. Stick with the carb you  
&gt; can maintain &amp; usu fix.
