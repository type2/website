Subject: [T2] Brakes- Going, Going, GONE!

Here's the scoop, volks:
    '74 westy, all new wheel cylinders, flushed out system. I replaced all 
the cylinders because none of them seemed to be leaking, but my brakes were 
always sorta spongy, despite my repeated bleedings (of the brakes).  Even 
after the cylinders were replaced,  they never got as solid as I would have 
liked. I put about 5000 highway miles on them and then got a job in 
Philadelphia where I commute for 1 hour each day to and from work. One day 
the pedal went to the floor and I felt like I lost my brakes, but in 
retrospect it seems like it could have been the booster, because I still was 
able to brake, I just had to push as hard as I could to get the bus to stop. 
I learned that pumping the brakes would help this. About this time I noticed 
that I was starting to mysterously loose brake fluid, but I couldn't find a 
leak after looking over the entire bus (this is all AFTER the new wheel 
cylinders and fluid). I never found the leak, but have always had to add 
fluid about every other week or so. On Wednesday, the brakes finally quit, or 
at least the booster (?) did, and it never came back. I checked my fluid and 
saw that it was extremely low, and after I added some, tested out the brakes 
again, but no power like before. Sure, I can stop, but the pedal goes a LONG 
way (almost to the floor) before the brakes start to slow the bus down and it 
takes more pressure than I had to before. 
I know that a new master cylinder would not hurt, because it is the only old 
cylinder left, but looking in Bus Depot's catalog, I didn't see any power 
brake boosters, only brake servos. Are these servos the same thing as a  
booster? 
I checked the archives and library and nothing seemed to answer my question, 
so I turn to you guys. 
Help me if you can. Thanks.
