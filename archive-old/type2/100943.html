&gt; In 1977 I rented a VW bus to tour Germany  with my wife and two of our sons. 
&gt;   It was a great vehicle except that it was equipped with a rev limiter.  
&gt; Getting on an autobahn got pretty exciting as the limiter kicked in when I 
&gt; needed revs the most.  Also, down shifting on hills took some getting used 
&gt; too.  Part of the problem is that the limiting action was rather abrupt and 
&gt; seemed to have some threshold hysteresis.
&gt; 
&gt; When I complained to the rental agent he said he understood but the motors 
&gt; dont last six months without the limiter. Germans love to rev and go fast.
&gt; 
&gt; Many years latter I passed on a 1977 bus to my youngest son . Six months 
&gt; later He brought it home with a blown piston.  Sons like to rev and go fast.

the rev limiting rotor is still avaliable, have em on my bus
