What's that? 
 
On my bus that would give me less that 3&quot; clearance between the axels. Where
does the shift linkage go?
 
&gt;one more, I have an HP-Bus and rather than raise the roof they have
&gt;lowered the floor.   Can stand in the bus.
&gt;
&gt;area between the axles has been lowered about 10 inches........
