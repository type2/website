Gentlepersons-
                       Are there any other seat bottoms (from another VW?), 
that will fit
the seat frame on my '79 bus? I've tried all the adjustment I've got and 
still look out
through the very top of the windshield. Any way to lower the seat, without 
major sur-
gery to the frame? I'm over 6' and the defroster just barely clears the fog 
up here...
Getting tired of driving like my neck's broke;-(
TIA
