Subject: RE: Big freakin' carbs

OK, folks.  Since I got a bunmch of responses I went home over lunch and 
grabbed some info.  Let me know if I get anything wrong.

The carbs were used on a '75 (pancake) 1800 engine, code ED010179.
They're made by Dellorto, and I think the model is &quot;DRLA36&quot;.  One had 
code &quot;8012L&quot; on it.  The other one is still attached to the engine, and I 
didn't have a  good way to see it (light's not that great in my 
basement), but it wouldn't surprise me if the other one had an &quot;R&quot; 
instead of an L.  

I'm not sure what they're worth, so make me an offer.  I'm willing to 
trade for parts as well.

Here are a few parts I'm looking for:  (all are for a '74 Bus)

- - exhuast system parts (I need them all)
- - a pair of 20570R14 tires
- - right front brake caliper (non-leaking) 
- - front spare tire mount
- - seat belts for middle seat
- - front seats with good springs/padding
- - a body that doesn't rust :)

Of course transactions could be plus or minus cash as well.

I'd also be willing to part with the aforementioned engine, which is 
apparently in good running condition except for drastically reduced 
compression in one cylinder.  (I don't know how this is &quot;good running 
condition&quot;, but that's what the PO said.)  The carbs I can ship.  The 
engine could probably be delivered within a few hours of Rochester NY, or 
you could pick it up.

While I'm wheeling and dealing, I have a '90 Jetta (Auto, 130k miles, 
non-working AC, built in Germany, one rust spot on trunk, runs great) that 
I'm selling.  I'm asking $3000.

Big bargains go to the person who offers to buy the carbs, the Jetta, 
*and* the engine. :)
