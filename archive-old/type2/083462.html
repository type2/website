&gt; I too have been concerned with temperature in my stock '70 Bus.  I put
this rebuilt engine in at the beginning of the year and its first long

at 70 all day long but any increment over
&gt; that brought my Berg dipstick to life.  I was concerned that the
speed/temperature matrix would get lower during the summer months.  In
anticipation of another trip this past weekend I switched from a
multiweight oil to straight 30 weight and gained 5
&gt; degrees on my matrix.  I'm happy to report that I can now cruise at 75
or better all day long and even push it over Pacheco Pass without
overheating.  I'm now a strong convert to using straight 30 weight in an air cooled VW.

I hope that you're measuring speed with a very optomistic speedometer.  A
stock '70 bus is spinning its poor little engine pretty fast at 65, let
alone 75!  I find that a comfortable cruising speed is more like 60-62
real MPH.

Be kind to your bus and it will cause you less worry.
