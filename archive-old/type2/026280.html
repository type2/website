Hey all,

Since I last filled up I have noticed an unusual increase in fuel
consumption.  I checked the oil and noticed gas in it.  From reading the
archives I can see that this might be due to a leaky fuel pump.  Is
there anything else that can cause this, bearing in mind:
1. The carbs have been rebuilt recently with new needle valves, although
the throttle bushes are worn and some fuel leaks out onto the manifolds.
2. Compression is OK.
I haven't noticed whether the gauge goes down when the bus is parked -
can fuel get past the pump even when the engine isn't running?
