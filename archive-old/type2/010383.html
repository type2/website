I had a similar problem with my '69. I know that the switches are not 
exactly the same but be VERY CAREFUL.
What happened to me was that while I was christmas shopping last year the 
switch decided to stick at the local mall. Now since the key was stuck in 
the on position I couldn't even lock it to go telephone for help. I fiddled 
with the switch for a good half hour before I finally got it loose. I fired 
it up and drove home thinking about what I would be doing the next day. When 
I got home I noticed that the switch seemed to go past the normal off 
position so I thought I would try to turn the ignition on and off again to 
see what would happen.
VERY BIG MISTAKE!
What it did was proceed to short out on the steering column mount and catch 
fire. Lucky for me there was a fire extinguisher handy so I gave it a quick 
squirt and then ran to the back with the 13mm wrench I keep in the glove box 
to disconnect the battery.
I fried the ign. switch,light switch and all the wires for the turn signals. 
The smell it finally gone but I still get the Halide creeping out of the 
joints in the dash board.
Like I said I know that the switches are not the same but... be careful.
