Your welcome...


&gt;  I'm going through the process of giving up my illusions and accepting what
&gt;is reality as far as VW are concerned.  I used to have a 72 transporter that
&gt;was made into a camper of sorts, bench seats removed and a deck put in with
&gt;a foam mattress on it.  Anyway, it had dual carbs of some variety and I'm
&gt;guessing now, a 2 liter engine.  It ran great with no problems and no
&gt;serious repairs.
&gt;
&gt;Anyway, I think I'm leaning toward going back to a 2 liter with stock dual
&gt;carbs as I love to drive my bus more than work on it.  So far, with my new
&gt;72, I spend every free moment working on it and not getting to drive it.

All stock 2.0 engines came with factory L-Jetronic fuel injection. If you 
have two single throat (barrel) carbs then you probably have the OEM carbs 
for a 1700 or 1800 cc (1.7 or 1.8) carbs. I think they should run fine on a 
2.0 but the need to be richened up - adjusted to produce more gas in the 
gas/air mixture to ensure that the engine doesn't run lean - that is too 
much air and not enough gas. You won't get as much power this way (too 
lean) and you will eventually cook your valves - if not the pistons too. It 
will cause the engine to overheat.

This adjustment involves only setting the mixture screw or maybe an air 
screw properly. If there isn't enough adjustment then you'll have to go 
with larger jets. Still no big deal, but you'll know your carbs much better 
when you are finished. (The jets regulate the gas or air flow through the 
carb - fine tuning it. The screws then fine tune that further to achieve 
the optimum mixture.) This is how you keep your engine happy and make the 
most power or most mpg you can. Many is the listers have these same OEM 
carbs so ask them how to adjust 'em. I've never had them on my bus. I've 
got OEM fuel injection.

If you have a pair of dual throat carbs then you have a pair of Weber or 
Dellorto conversion carbs. If they are small (36mm or so throat diameter) 
then you can still get decent mileage. Probably low 20's. I got mid 20's in 
my '65 Beetle running them on a bus engine in it. I was also towing a 
Hyundai from Virginia to TN with the Beetle... Another story...

If your engine is a real unmolested fuel injection motor then consider 
upgrading the camshaft and valve diameters to get the maximum air flow 
through the cylinders and thus the best power/mpg you can. The fuel 
injection motors have very small valves and very mild camshafts to help the 
very rudimentary fuel injection systems they came with OEM (Original 
Equipment Manufacturer -- that is original from the factory) happy. The 
cams and a set of new lifters cost less than $100 and you get the 
experience of tearing your motor down to install it. Don't worry you don't 
need to do this immediately --- just if you feel like it later. And I would 
wait until you've had some fun with your bus first.

CIS by the way is the mechanical fuel injection system that Bosch sold to 
all of the European car manufacturers in the 70's and 80's. In the later 
versions they were pretty good and could attain a little better mpg, and 
power, and meet air pollution standards better than carbs. Basically better 
regulation of the fuel flow.

Again go have some fun with your bus before you get into something like 
this. Like anything else - get good at the basic stuff so the heavy stuff 
makes sense when you get to that. You'll understand why you are doing 
things like this then. Also the more unique you make your bus, the more you 
will be the only one who can work on it! So you better be a CIS expert 
because nobody will have seen CIS on an air cooled bus I'll bet except a 
few listers who have done the conversion themselves...

&gt;As far as what you posted, it was really helpful.  Though, I have no idea
&gt;what OEM means, what exactly hydraulic lifters are or what a CIS injection
&gt;is or does.  I'm really just getting started into doing serious work on my
&gt;bus and have many many anxious moments looking at its enigmatic workings at
&gt;times.  My girlfriend does her best to help, but is more Martha Stewart than
&gt;Bob Villa if you know what I mean.
&gt;
&gt;When I stumbled onto this list I was elated to find such a resource, now
&gt;that I've been on it for a few months, I find it somewhat terrifying.  It
&gt;seems like everyone is constantly in the middle of some sort of major repair
&gt;all the time and never really out tooling around.
&gt;
&gt;Anyway, I'm curious if there is a way to change the gearing to make it less
&gt;low.  Is that a transmission change?  Right now 1st gear goes to about
&gt;15mph, going to 20 sounds like the engine is going to fly out of the bus.
&gt;2nd gear is good to 25.  3rd can get me to 55 before the engine is just
&gt;racing and 4th gear gets me to a gutless 70-75 on a flat stretch.  Of
&gt;course, Seattle is a collection of hills jammed together, with near daily
&gt;rainfall and far too many idiotic rich twits driving their SUV's down the
&gt;broken center line or on the shoulder with a cell phone in one hand and a
&gt;Mocha Grande in the other.  But I'm not bitter... ;p

Your gearbox sounds about right for a 2.0 liter bus. You're driving a 3500 
lb bus and pushing it around with a 67 hp engine out back. That was 67 HP 
at the factory 20 years ago and I'll bet it's around 57 HP nowadays - wear 
and tear and age. If you put a higher geared tranny in your bus you'll get 
lower rpm's, lower noise, more engine heat, more mpg (maybe), and less 
durability.

You may use more gas in fact as you will have to put your foot down further 
to get the bus to twist the tranny shafts harder to maintain your speed. I 
had a friend with a '73 US spec Super Beetle when we were stationed 
overseas. The car came stock with a 3.88 gearbox (I think) and a 65 HP 
1600cc engine. The engine blew up and the PO (previous owner) had put a 
garden variety engine in to replace the old one. The garden variety engine 
in Italy was 1200cc 40 HP. I had a European spec '72 (same as a US '73) 
Super Beetle identical in every way that came factory with a 40 HP engine 
and the correct gearbox (a 4.something? - a much lower geared tranny). I 
could out run him everywhere but the downhill stretches.

On flat ground or on hills (it was awful on hills) the engine did not have 
enough power to get into it's power band because it could never overcome 
the inertia of the car, and the weight of the car or the higher geared 
tranny. On downhills, since it only had to push the wind, the car would run 
90 mph or better. The gas mileage was worse because he always had his foot 
on the floor urging the car on. Even with the less HP, and the smaller 
motor and the higher revs my Beetle could return mid thirties mpg. His 
maybe low 20's. His motor didn't last long, it overheated one hot day and 
croaked.

Lower rpms meant less fan rpms and more heat. And more heat because of the 
perpetual struggle to push the car around. Much like pedalling your bicycle 
in 10th gear versus 2nd gear. You'll sweat more and give up sooner. Now 
attach a fan to the chain too. Less fan blow when you can't pedal faster. 
Your VW depends on this fan to keep it alive. Your heater will depend on 
this fan to push heat up to you in the winter.

&gt;Anyway, it'd would be great to be able to cruise at a steady 65-70 with
&gt;decent gas mileage and not have grease on every piece of clothing I own from
&gt;having to do sudden repairs every time I drive.
&gt;
&gt;Thanks again!

The only way you can make the bus faster is to make it make more power. 
Then you can force it through a higher geared tranny.

There are many ways of making more power - more cylinders (6 cylinder 
Porsche or Corvair or Subby SVX) or ...

larger cylinders (more cc's - like 100mm pistons versus the OEM 94mm 
pistons of a stock 2.0) or...

  bigger valves, wilder cam, and bigger exhaust +  big carbs (the more fuel 
and air you can flow and combust the more power you make - and worse mpg) or...

longer stroke engines or...

through blueprinting your engine and with perfect tuning (mild changes but 
ensuring everything existing is as perfect as you can make it).

Some guys go for large engines and sometimes they get sloppy. That can lead 
to a sort lived expensive engine that could still make more power if they 
had picked their parts combinations better. Some combinations are better 
than others. A race engine may make 400 HP or 1000 HP in an Indy car from 
only 1.5 but it would be miserable to drive in traffic (no torque or HP) 
until 10,000 rpm or more. A Kawasaki 1000cc motorcycles motor can make in 
excess of 100 HP but again no umpf until 9000 rpm+. Some VW engines work 
better than others - stroke/bore/fuel system/exhaust combos. Stick with OEM 
for a while and tune it. Eventually the 'bug' will get to you and you'll do 
something crazy!

Some guys like me are turned on to 'perfect engines' - engines refined (not 
necessarily redesigned) until it is built the best I can, it uses the best 
fuel delivery system I can provide, the best ignition, the best exhaust 
choice., etc. Sometimes this equals big money and sometimes it doesn't.

It's the reason equal size American four bangers and Jap four bangers 
aren't equal - the Jap four bangers traditionally lasting longer and 
providing more power and getting better mpg --- Chevette four cylinder 
compared to equal vintage Honda/Toyota/VW etc. It's changing though.

I'll assume you are a mechanical novice. Don't always believe the ads 
though, a shiny part doesn't always work the best. Ask around and see what 
everyone is doing for a solution first and then look to see what the 
factory was doing in later models.

The factory usually leans to the conservative side of things - wanting 
their product to have a reputation of quality and durability. Sometimes you 
can take their later designs (Vanagon ignition for example) and adapt it to 
use on your older vehicle and reap the benefits of the better later model 
parts (newer, more refined design) and sometime you can sacrifice a little 
durability for a little more power (fun).

Make small changes at first. Learn to build and maintain reliability first.

You can follow the factory train of thought (conservative). Ask why the 
factory didn't do this 'trick' in the first place - - higher cost, the 
marketing guys didn't want the bus to compete with sports car they sold, 
less durability, better chance you'd blow up the engine (remember cars are 
build for non-mechanics to drive - they don't want to make something that 
is finicky or tends to have narrow margins of error - like overheating...) 
or did the factory just not have the technology to accomplish what you have 
in mind?

Better speed or better mpg? One idea the factory should have provided in 
the Baywindow busses was a 5 speed tranny - a tranny with more gears closer 
together. If you are careful and if you have an engine that is RIGHT on the 
money (factory condition or better - no tendency to overheat) then you can 
fudge a little with a slightly higher gear for top gear. Not much though - 
I'm thinking maybe something that gives you 500 rpm slower or something. 
Another solution would be to simply make your bus quieter - sound padding - 
so it didn't sound like it was going to fly apart.... I have a friend with 
a &lt;80K miles bus that is quieter than my 178K mile bus. I've been studying 
it a while. It led me to a broken tranny mount on my bus allowing the metal 
of a engine bracket to touch the metal of the frame. Lots of noise fro back 
there. Her bus was very tolerable on the highway and showed me how much 
better my bus could be. Her bus also had good seals on all the doors and 
windows and pop top. It also had the heavy OEM rubber mat on the front 
floor board. New tires too. I want mine quieter than her's but now I know 
something was wrong with mine that caused it to be louder than the factory 
intended it to be.

Why have all of the small cars and trucks in the past 20 years come with 
five speeds? Because they don't have much power either (relative to the V-6 
or V-8 crowds) and with a closer ratio tranny you don't give up as much 
rpms when you shift and thus you are able to stay in your power band easier 
- - and thus are able to take off faster. The car can also be shifted down 
a gear on hills to maintain seed. My bus would have to slow 20 mph or so to 
run at a reasonable seed in 3rd gear - much too low on the interstate hills.

One lister has added a 911 5 speed to his Bus.  He's the reason I'll be 
doing the same. As far as I know none of the old Baywindow buses ever came 
with a 5 speed but there were a couple of the foreign market Vanagons that 
came with 5 speeds. Gene Berg has a conversion kit to make a VW 4 speed 
into a 5 speed for the Beetles. Dunno if he can do it to a bus tranny. 914 
Porsches came with 5 speeds sometimes and they share engines with the bus 
so I know they will bolt up. (By the way the 914 is mid engined and the 
engine came with higher compression, bigger valves, etc. and would be an 
overheating nightmare in the wrong hands once installed in a bus. To run a 
914 5 speed you have to do some switching on the internals and the shifter 
linkage.)

Whew!!!

Man am I long winded or what?

Take care and write back if you like. I have enjoyed all of this writing 
sounding like I knew something - or something. Be sure to investigate 
anything you might think sounded too good - I have been known to be wrong 
(daily...).

&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Any of the two liter engines are good. Just build it stock and make sure
&gt; &gt; that you build it with hydraulic lifters. 70 mph is really pushing an old
&gt; &gt; VW hard as they are geared so low. 60-65 will make it much happier and last
&gt; &gt; much longer.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; The Subaru engines are very good but you'll have to sort out a suitable
&gt; &gt; transaxle arrangment as the VW is really geared too low for what a good
&gt; &gt; sized Subby can deliver.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I am looking at two possible solutions. One is rebuild my existing 2.0 Type
&gt; &gt; IV but blueprint it as I go along - in other words, build a perfect engine
&gt; &gt; and then mate it to a Porsche 5 speed tranny that is geared as close to my
&gt; &gt; stock Westy tranny or within 200-400 rpm of that number (only if it is
&gt; &gt; geared higher than OEM). If you gear anything air cooled too high, you'll
&gt; &gt; cook it because it will run due to less cooling air and more heat from
&gt; &gt; being lugged. OEM gearing was a compromise between running the engine fast
&gt; &gt; enough to cool and make power and slow enough to keep it quiet and get
&gt; &gt; reasonable MPG.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Next option would be a Corvair. They aren't bad engines but they aren't as
&gt; &gt; refined as a VW Type IV engine. Also they aren't as good quality wise. They
&gt; &gt; also require much more attention. Also there will be a fewer sources for
&gt; &gt; repair or parts. Not good if you are travelling far from home!
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; The Porsche 911 six cylindes are very good engines but, but, but --- a
&gt; &gt; typical conversion will cost $2K - $6K. Repair costs are ridiculously
&gt; &gt; expensive also. a typical conversion will only get mid-teens mpg also. Also
&gt; &gt; unless you can manage to afford a 3.0, most of the smaller engines will
&gt; &gt; only put out 100-135 HP. Stay away from the 2.7 liter engines.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; My choice would be to build  a blueprinted 2.0, go to CIS injection (better
&gt; &gt; power, better mpg), and then run it with a 911 5 speed. A Corvair with the
&gt; &gt; above treatment will put out 120 HP or so and get mid to low 20's mpg and
&gt; &gt; be cheaper than a Porsche but still cost lots of $$$. A Corvair engine
&gt; &gt; costs about $150 if you are lucky but will cost $600 and up to rebuild. The
&gt; &gt; CIS injection will either be a self built arrangement or there are a couple
&gt; &gt; of souces for kits. Still not cheap.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I hope this answered more questions than it raised but write me back if I
&gt; &gt; can answer anything. I'd like to learn from you though, if there is
&gt; &gt; something I got wrong...
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Take care!

&gt; &gt;&gt; I'm toying with the idea of building an engine.  I don't want to pull my

&gt; &gt;&gt; I would like to have a reliable motor with a decent amount of

&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; I keep hearing about Porsche engines, V6's, Japanese motors, hydraulic
