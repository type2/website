Subject: Engine cranks but NO JUICE to coil...poor thirsty coil : (

Hey there Guys and Gals,

Well, I've been searchin the archives for the past few hours and get &quot;very
close&quot; but &quot;No Cigar&quot; so here I am : )    I'm still working on the 80 Custom
Poptop with the stock 2.0 air-cooled with FI every time I make it back to OKC
(which hasn't been often enough) 

 My problem is this: starter works fine and engine turns over but NO spark
from the coil.  If ya remember a few weeks ago I replaced the plugs and coil
(old coil had orange spark at time).  I know the new coil is good because it
worked a couple a weeks ago when I was last there but I tried the coil off my
daily driver (82 Westy 2.0 AC FI) just ta make sure and didn't get a spark
from that coil either.  I checked all the fuses with VOM and they checked OK.
Battery at full charge but I did notice the voltage regulator area on back of
the ALT got HOT while doin all that cranking or come ta think of it even got
hot with just the key in the ignition. Would this prevent juice to the coil?
If I'm overlookin the obvious ...SLAP ME! : )

 I pulled the Volt Reg out to test it (any suggestions on how?) and noticed
the PO has a little brown wire soldered to it that was crimped to a red wire I
haven't traced yet... What would ya run off the Volt Reg? Gauge of somesort? 
BTW, a buddy o'mine did try to jump it last week to move it outta the driveway
after runnin down the battery.  I've heard this can sometimes cause problems.
I'm flyin back there on Monday so hope ta apply some of the &quot;massive
brainpower&quot; of the list to &quot;Eve&quot;  I know she's gettin lonely sittin there in
the drive :..(

Thanks in advance for any input or suggestions.  Gotta luv the list.


Later man,
