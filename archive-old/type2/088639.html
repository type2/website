Subject: Re: [T2] Spray-in Bed Liners


&gt; I was informed that a  local place that  does it for the trucking crowd,
&gt; 1.  blasts it bare.
&gt; 2.  puts down a binder layer/primer layer
&gt; 3.  applies rhino
&gt; 4.  extracts wallet

The last part is the part that I have heard about. VERY expensive process!
Not that many people do it.. This is for pretty vain truck owners who can
afford it. Bed liners are cheaper and more practical. If you're just
intending to cover this up, maybe it's not for you.
I think that white synthetic rubber is called, &quot;Snow Roof&quot; or something like
that. It's good! Jan B
