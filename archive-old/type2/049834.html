&quot;...Last but not least will be a New Samba concept
styled at VW's Simi
Valley design studio in Southern California.
Reportedly, this seven-passenger,
multi-purpose vehicle with design cues taken from
VW's venerable old microbus
from the 1960s and '70s is meant to gauge public
reaction to a possible new
VW van/activity vehicle. We can't wait to weigh
in....&quot;
