Subject: [T2] Re:getting over the bleeding hump 

Steve,
I'll try and be to the point
DON'T let the master cylinder res go dry while bleeding.

Check and adjust rear brakes
bleed brakes
adjust rear brakes again
Does the parking brake handle come all the way out almost
to the end. Should only come out about 1-2 inchs I think.
Sounds werid but mis-adjusted rear brakes can give the
spongy pedel effect.

Did you replace the hoses? old ones can expand with pressure

Check for leaks
Around the master cylinder, at all the wheels and
follow the metal lines looking for leaks.

Also you said
&gt;when i opened the cylinder valve on that rear passenger side, little or 
&gt;usually no fluid came out. its a brief
&gt;sputter, like an old timey soda jerk gassy kind of sound
Doesnt sound good, try loosing the bleed valve an extra turn
see if anything comes out then.
Are you using a buddy to push the pedel down while your opening
the bleeder valve or just trying to build up pressure then
bleed by yourself?

Also check the archive for &quot;spongy brakes&quot;
some info there I believe

hope that helps

&gt;all the big tasks were done...i thought. rebuilt calipers, new front
&gt;bearings, wheel cylinders, new shoes, pads, and brake cables. it was &gt;all 
&gt;going downhill! bleed the brakes, and top it off right?
&gt;right rear wheel bleed has become a curiousity and i'd like to ask &gt;the 
&gt;list about it. i have mushy brakes. during the first part of the &gt;bleed 
&gt;process i got a good deal of pressure built. when i opened the &gt;cylinder 
&gt;valve on that rear passenger side, little or usually no &gt;fluid came out. 
&gt;its a brief sputter, like an old timey soda jerk &gt;gassy kind of sound. the 
&gt;brand new &quot;german&quot; wheel cylinder is tight &gt;to the brake line - no obvious 
&gt;hiss or fluid there. the bleeder valve &gt;was cheese, so i put a new old one 
&gt;in.
&gt;better, but still no horse p!ss from the open valve. all the other &gt;valves 
&gt;-
&gt;on tight.

&gt;Q: i've been going around and bleeding each wheel for a few hours. &gt;topping
&gt;the reservoir going around the circle. any hints, clues, &amp; help?
&gt;
&gt;always appreciative,
&gt;steve
