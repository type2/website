Hi Zach -

Thanks for the reply on my Type 4 motor.

&gt;EA engines were also used in the porsche 914. 

Kewl!  A  _racing_   bus!  I LUV IT!!!

&gt;.... you can tell if it is a 914 longblock if it has 3 bolt intakes
(914) or 4-bolt intakes (bus/411).

4 bolt intakes.  dang.  My dreams of speed shot to ribbons.  8-(   Ah,
well.....

&gt;carbs----------7.8:1

Wow!  That's a bit higher than I'd planned on.  I was kinda/sorta
shooting for ~ 6.9:1.  7.8:1 might be OK for the lighter 411/412 sedans,
but I wonder about a heavy bus?   Hmmmm....  Planning on ceramic-coating
the pistons; maybe that'd help contain/control combustion chamber temps. 
Kinda curious, Zach...  I keep seeing 'domed' 1.7 pistons advertised. 
Were these the ones that gave a 7.8:1 compression ratio?

&gt;also with a 411/412 engine going into a bus you have to put in a
electric
&gt;fuel pump

Yeah, I see what you mean.  There's a boss for mounting a mechanical fuel
pump, but it isn't cut thru the case.  An electric pump for sure.  

&gt;also the carbs were different but thats a WHOLE 'nother story!!

????   I was just planning on finding a set of 72/73 bus carbs and using
those.  'Course, the fall-back position is to get a Weber progressive and
mount it to the existing manifold.  Oh, well; not a decision I need to
make tonite!  8-D  Thanks again for the info - I really appreciate it!
