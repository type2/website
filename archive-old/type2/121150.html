Subject: Re: [T2] air/fuel ratios for a 2.0L

I apologize, the EFI is not stock, but the rest of the engine is.

I am looking for some numbers to which I can tune my megasquirt (full,
cruise, and decel).  I can set the A/F close to whatever desired ratio
I'm looking for.

thanks,
Mike

&gt; The only stock adjustment is at idle. It is always done after the 
&gt; mechanicals and ignition are verified stock. For higher RPMS the correct 
&gt; mixture is controlled by the design of the FI system. If it is set stock 
&gt; at idle it will be in spec at all RPMs and loads.
