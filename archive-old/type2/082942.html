Subject: rear vanagon seats and diy zbed

Hello everyone,

Today was a beautiful day, so my girlfriend and I took advantage of it
by putting together a convertible bed for our passenger vanagon.  I think
it worked out very well.  

We no longer have any use for the rear seat.  It is in fairly decent
shape.  No tears in the vinyl.  The seat is brown, leatherette out of
an air cooled '83.  They are free to anybody that would pick them up.
I live in the Maryland suburbs of DC.  I would hate to throw them away
but that would probably what would happen if nobody else was interested
in them.

thanks,
Ed Knuth
