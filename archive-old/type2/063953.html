Subject: re:Bumber Stickers (longish)

Hey there,

Sorry if this thread is a little old but I saw this and I couldn't resist. I'd post this on 
Friday but I get friday's off.  You could save until then if you want I guess :). 
(Disclaimer: I'n not a Christian and I have nothing against Christians so I hope this 
doesn't offend anyone) Some obvious stuff is changed.

        The other day I went to the local religious book store where I saw a 
&quot;HONK IF YOU LOVE JESUS&quot;  bumper sticker.  I bought it and put it on the back 
bumper of my VW Bus, and I'm really glad I did.  What an uplifting experience 
followed.
        I was stopped at the light at a busy intersection, just lost in thought about 
the Lord, and didn't notice that the light had changed.  The bumper sticker really 
worked!!  I found lots of people who really love Jesus.  Why, the guy behind me 
started to honk like crazy.  He must REALLY love the Lord because pretty soon he 
leaned out his window and yelled &quot;JESUS CHRIST&quot; as loud as he could.  It was like a 
football game with him yelling &quot; GO, JESUS CHRIST, GO!! &quot;  Everyone else started 
honking too, so I leaned out my window and waved and smiled to all of those loving 
people.  There must have been a guy from Florida back there because I could hear him 
yelling something about a sunny beach and saw him waving in a funny way with only 
his finger stuck up in the air.  I asked my kids what this meant.  They kind of 
squirmed, looked at each other, giggled and told me that it was the Hawaiian good 
luck sign.  So, I leaned out my window and gave him the good luck sign back.   Several 
cars behind, a very nice nice black man stepped out of his car and yelled something.  I 
couldn't hear him very well, but it sounded like &quot; Mother Tucker&quot;  or &quot;Mother's from 
there&quot;.  Maybe he was from Florida too?  He must really love the Lord.  A couple of the 
people were so caught up in the joy of the moment that they got out of their cars and 
and were walking to me.  I bet they wanted to pray (or wanted to admire my beautiful 
bus), but just then I noticed that the light had changed, and I stepped on the gas.  
And a good thing I did because I was the only driver to get across the intersection.  As 
I looked back at them standing there, I leaned way out the window, gave them a big 
smile and held up the Hawaiian good luck sign, as I drove away.  Praise the Lord for 
such wonderful folks!!


That's it - Sorry for wasting bandwidth!  Ahh, well back to work.
