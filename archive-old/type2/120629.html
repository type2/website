Subject: VW prototype picture?

A friend of me got some pictures of the VW archive.
Among them were pictures of two US-buses. One of them
I know: It's the 'Champagne Edition II' from
1978...but what is the other one? Has anyone ever seen
it? Could it be a prototype/tryout that was never for
sale? Please tell me if you know anything about it. I
am very interested in knowing more about this bus.

Special things on the 'mystery' bus:

- chrome bumpers with rubber strips
- rubber strips on cabin doors (never used on US buses
for as far as I know)
- special colors (which colors would that be?)
- wheels in paintcolour (instead of silver)

Here are the links to the pictures:

-- unknown special model --
  (unknown to me at least...)
