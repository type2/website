Subject: 71 Westy Luggage Rack Bottom Bushings ?

Howdy

I remember long ago seeing information on NAPA bushings '650-1110' and 
'650-1113' and have searched the archives and found the information.

&gt;FYI
&gt;When I redid my luggage rack I had good luck replacing the back =
&gt;bushings with parts from Napa.  For the 2 outside I used part # 650-1110 =
&gt;and for the middle one I used part # 650-1113.  I also replaced the =
&gt;screws with new stainless steel ones that are about a 1/4 in longer than =
&gt;the original.  I've had no leaks or problems so far.
&gt;Steve

So I went to NAPAs online web store and tried the numbers with no luck.

Does anybody have any other suggestions?
Mine are pretty dried out and need replacing.

Thanks
Kevin
