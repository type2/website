Subject: Re: [T2] Dometic fridge in 78-79

My dometic 182 quit permanently on me... but it has been noted that an 
added fan(s) (internal as well) does have benefits.  I replaced mine 
with a dometic sc3000 and it also benefits from a fan blowing on the 
apparatus on the back.  While rolling I use the 12V but  i use it 
through a  connection to an aux batt that stays on while i am  parked.  
When i reach site i  switch to gas.  Before putting anything into the 
fridge it really helps if it is already  cooled down.  I start mine off 
several hours early on the ac connection and then add what i am putting 
into it.

&gt; My experience with the fridge is this:
&gt; a) works great at 120VAC (supply 14.5 VDC to the
&gt; heaters)b) Therefore it must work great at 14.5 VDC (engine
&gt; running, but car not moving).c) Doesnt work well while moving.  My 
&gt; guess is that its
&gt; because the fridge is convective, which works better
&gt; with no motion. So when you finally get to the campground the fridge is
&gt; warmer, the battery cant keep up, and as it looses
&gt; voltage the fridge drops very quickly.my 100Ahr battery lasted about 
&gt; overnight.  Two days and
&gt; it was toast.In my view the real issue is D above.  If it would be
&gt; rock frozen cold (like the morning I left home) when Ifinally parked at 
&gt; the campground, it would probably
&gt; last more than overnight.In light of all that.  Has anyone considered 
&gt; putting
&gt; thermoelectric fridge guts into the dometic body(either as a swap out, 
&gt; or an add in).  Since the
&gt; thermoelectric unit is motion immune, it should becolder at the site, 
&gt; and therefore should last longer
&gt; too.
&gt; Logan
&gt; PS has anyone installed a small fan in fridge to aid
&gt; convection of cold air?
