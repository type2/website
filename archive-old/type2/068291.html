&gt;i got a question.  i've been looking around my area, which is the 
&gt;raleigh/triangle area, trying to find a split window bus and i've been 
&gt;having a hell of a time just finding any buses in at least decent 
&gt;condition.  do you know of any place around here or someone/where that i 
&gt;could contact about the avaiblity of vw split windows? a vw spilt window 
&gt;bus has been my dream car for about as long as i can remember and i'mn 
&gt;having a hell of time locating one.  please help!
