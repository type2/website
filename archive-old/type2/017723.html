&gt;So,
&gt;I read Bob Hoover's &quot;Forever Pop top&quot; a long time ago.  I have been
&gt;looking for Al powder EVERYWHERE!
&gt;I have called all of the paint stores in the area, boat/marine stores,
&gt;hardware stores, even looked it up in a chemical catalog ($$$$).
&gt;
&gt;I have heard of adding metal to the paint that goes onto the bottom of
&gt;boats, but I could not find any powder anywhere (even at the beach -more
&gt;boats)
&gt;
Aluminum and zinc powders are available by mail from
http://www.skylighter_dot_com.  About $5-10/lb.  Caution:  they are both highly
flammable and a spark can set off the dust; once wetted with paint (NOT
waterbased paint!!!) they are innocuous.  Mix very slowly (to avoid
&quot;dusting&quot;) into the paint until the powder is thoroughly wetted.

When you see the web site and the use for those materials you may understand
why Al powder is so hard to find...

For a metallic look the 'bright flake' aluminum would probably be best.
