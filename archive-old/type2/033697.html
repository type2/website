Subject: What Now? New engine

Volks:

I haven't had time to report on the progress, or lack there of, with my
fresh engine.  The last time I posted I was having trouble with the
transmission.   I'm actually too embarrassed to tell you what was wrong,
but suffice it to say, it was an easy fix after wasting money on
parts;).

anyway, I still haven't had a successful maiden voyage.  I tried last
week to run to the store and ffill up with gas.  The engine had been
running great sitting in the yard.  Started as soon as I touched the
key.  Well, I got about 4 blocks and it started to backfire and
sputter.   It seemed I was out of gas.  Called the wife to bring the gas
tank.  Put a couple of gallons in it and it wouldn't start.  Finally got
it to start and continued to the store with the S.O. following.  I
started loosing power. I couldn't dpress the accelerator peddal more
than half way without loosing power.  Then the backfiring came back. 
Stumbled to the store and filled up with gas.  Again it didn't want to
start after filling up.  I got it started and left it idling while
airing the tires and it died.  Again wouldn't start.  Drained the
battery trying.  Sent the wife after the jumper cables.  With the cables
I got it started and started home (~1 mile).   About half way home power
was steadily decreasing and upshifting began.  As I rolled into the
driveway, I could only make about 5 m.p.h.  I don't believe it is a
vacuum leak.  The brake booster was disconnected while waiting for new
vacuum hose to arive.  Before the trip, sitting in the yard it ran
perfectly.  I have since removed the carb and dipped it with a rebuild
kit install later today.  Could this be the float?  Improperly adjusted
carb?  What else?  I'm gonna retorque the heads while the engine is out,
but I gotta get it all back together in time for Xmas.  

Any suggestions welcome.

Send busma my way.  I've been REALLY short.
