Subject: Re: [T2] late bay owners 76-79

I think that very first picture points out what I am missing, and I &quot;think&quot;
it is just that little
fabric 3 way connector thingy seen here :
http://www.wicals_dot_com/troy/vw/enginebay/images/DSC00261.jpg

What I am not sure of is what that third thing connects to. The one coming
from the left meets up with the one coming in from the right, but then it
connects to something else going back towards the gas tank, or airbox, I
can't really tell.

Do you have a picture showing that specific connection, or more importantly
where that third thing connects to?

The url above shows that same picture as you have I think, just without
anything properly connected.

&gt; Christopher,
&gt; I went and took some pics of my engine bay and posted them on my
&gt; site.  Check them out here.  www.wicals_dot_com/troy/vw/enginebay/index.htm
&gt; I did not compress these images as to hopefully give you as much detail
&gt; as possible.  I just replaced all my vaccum lines recently as well as
&gt; the throttle body gasket and it did a world of help.  I would highly
&gt; recommend this be done if your lines look worn.  Also look at the fuel
&gt; lines.  Let me know if you need different angles or more pics.
&gt;
&gt; Good luck
&gt;

&gt;
&gt; fellow listmembers......
&gt;
&gt; I have been working on finding all of the &quot;this isn't connected to
&gt; anything&quot;
&gt; type stuff
&gt; and putting it all back together regardless of how important it seems,
&gt; and
&gt; still working
&gt; on these tubes that come out of the fuel system someplace, I believe to
&gt; help
&gt; it breathe.
&gt;
&gt; The top right hand side of my charcoal canister, there is a thin little
&gt; tube
&gt; that goes noplace
&gt; currently, and I think that is part of this same system.

&gt;
&gt; Here is a pic of what I do have now, I think I am definetly missing some
&gt; of
&gt; those items.
&gt; Could you take a look at this and see what I'll need to get this put
&gt; back
&gt; together correctly?
&gt;
&gt; Just not sure what I need to order, or if I can get what I need at a
&gt; hardware store/flaps to fix this?
&gt;
&gt; thanks for any tips, info, tomfoolery you can shed on the subject...
&gt;
&gt; Christopher
