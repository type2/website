Subject: Re: [T2] Friday bus sightings

There is also a commercial, I forget what its for, but its just a bunch of people who say I brake for this and I brake for that, one after the other.  One girl is standing behind a late dark green bay window with the hatch open and she says &quot;I brake for animals&quot;, or something like that. You don't really see much of the bus, only enough of the body lines and shape to know what it is.  I just have no idea what the ad is for, maybe some type of financial service.
