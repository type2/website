&gt;      I have been having some problems getting the dual Solex's tweaked

&gt;extends off the bottom of the fuel pump and is not connected to anything.
&gt;Perhaps it is some kind of breather or overflow.  I do not know much about
&gt;these things but i am willing with the help of another local listee (thanks
&gt;Josh) to try to keep this bus alive forever.  I am curious to what might
&gt;cause fuel to come out of this hose.

Busted diaphragm in the fuel pump - the hose is a drain.  You have a few 
options:

1.  Replace with Facet electric pump ($25)
2.  Replace with new Brazilian pump ($35)
3.  Rebuild stock pump with kit ($40).

I have tried options 1 and 2, and while they both worked, I wouldn't 
recommend either as long as option #3 is available.  Option 1 is noisy, has 
safety issues with the pump running while the engine is off, and requires 
engineering to mount and plumb.  Option 2 resulted in 10+ psi fuel 
pressure, which I had to regulate with an external Holley fuel pressure 
regulator to keep from overpowering my needle valves in the carbs.  Some 
have said you can shim the pump to reduce the pressure, but I haven't tried 
it.  The threads in the fuel pump mounting holes on my block are 
questionable so I didn't want to remove the pump to shim it, plus I didn't 
have a ready source of shims of various thicknesses nor the time or place 
to experiment with setting it up.

So, I would try to obtain an OEM fuel pump rebuild kit for the best chance 
of success.
