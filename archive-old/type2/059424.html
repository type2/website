Went to Oktoberbus this weekend.

Planned to buy a hitch from listee Chris (cybulski1_at_email.msn_dot_com) but would
not fit, as his is a 72 and mine is a 71. Too wide. Anyway, the design is
perfect. Uses the same holes as the rear bumper mounts (no drilling), attaches
to a round bar that hides behind the bumper, then curves around the bumper to
the ball. NO holes in the bumper! Anyone got one like it for a 68-71??

rather than having a hitch attach where the bumper brackets bolt to the bus,
or to the bumper brackets, it is sturdier to have a tow hitch that extends
under the motor to the rear torsion tube, with a piece on the rear bumper than
just keeps the tow ball from falling down.  This way you are towing with a
much stronger part of the bus.  I have seen those bumper attach holes that
have been worse for wear.    One kind has a Uish shaped bracket that fits in
the bumper curve, requiring one discreet hole to be drilled for a bolt on the
under side.   Another kind uses a bar that runs between the two bumper
brackets, with a bolt througheach bumper bracket, and this bolts to the piece
that runs forward unde rthe motor to the torsion tubes, and back under the
bumper to the tow ball.   These are two fairly old styles of tow hitches I
have seen for VW buses.  Don't know manufacturer, name, availability- I have
seen both kinds at swap meets.

  I have also seen VW to hitches for bay windows that bolt into the frame on
each side of the engine compartment- you have to install it before you put the
apron on.  The bus it was on had it factory installed, but I don't remember
exactly where, or if it was special reinforced.  

These make it a bit more work to pull the motor, but if you want to tow that
is worth it.
