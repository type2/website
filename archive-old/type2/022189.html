&gt;Howzit this is mike, I own a 1970 bus and am interested in your project
of
&gt;the dash lights and the transfroming your head lights to Halogens.  can 
&gt;you give me some insite to the headlight project.  kind of lights any
special
&gt;things you have to configure?  
=================================&gt;
Hi Mike,
I  bought direct plug in replacement headlights and backup lights at Pep
Boys. Just took the old ones out and put the new halogen ones in their
place. This was for my '69 bus, and am gonna do the same to my '70 as soon
as I &quot;get to it&quot; !

Works great! ................ Lots of extra light going down the road and
lots better looking out back as you gingerly reverse into those camping
spaces at night.

I am pretty sure that the dash bulbs can also be replaced, but have not
investigated.
I will do so, but was asking the list if anyone had done this. I am
concerned about possible extra heat buildup in the holders, etc.

Will let you know what I find on the dash lights, whether from list inputs
or going after it on my own.
