&gt; &lt;BTW a four-cylinder engine is capable of producing better MPG than a six or
eight. This is due to the longer TIME for combustion allowed by fewer
cylinders for better efficiency. The longer time for the burning process in a
four is twice that of an eight. Thus an eight is inherently more wasteful of
fuel in theory than a four or six. This simple fact is not well known. More
cylinders shorten the time that combustion has to finish the total job of
burning all the fuel.&gt;

I didn't quite get that one either.  The length of time given for
combustion is directly related to RPM, not number of cylinders.  As
you point out, in general more cylinders typically allows you lower
RPM, which should be a longer combustion time.  There are exceptions -
F1 V-10s run at ridiculous speeds, and we used to have a JD
two-cylinder diesel tractor that produced power at some pretty
ridiculously slow speeds.
