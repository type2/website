David,

    Permatex 3H is a non hardning thread sealer. A little teflon tape would
do just as well, for that matter nothing at all would be just fine in this
case. If you use the teflon tape make sure it dosen't extend into the oil
gally.
    My Father used to use a dab of paint on pipe threads, worked fine. Also
be carefull and don't overtighten, and split the opening.
