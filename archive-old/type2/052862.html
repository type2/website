&gt; I agree with Karl.  The vehicle _illustrated_ in the brochure is definitely
&gt; a 1970 Campmobile.  In fact, it's identical to my '70 Campmobile except for
&gt; the hubcaps.

It may be an even earlier vehicle (I think this has come up before).  If
you look closely at the square side marker lites, its possible that they
were airbrushed in.  This is especially apparent if you look at a hard
copy of the brochure.

Jumpseat behind driver is the low-back kind (when did they switch to
highback - 70? 71?).  

Can't see the sink well enough to tell which variant we're looking at
but it appears to be the steel top rather than the plastic that was on
my 68.  Also has the drop-down door above cooler, rather than the drawer
-- again that's 70?  69?

&gt; I believe a frugal sales/promotion department simply recycled a nicely
&gt; illustrated '70 brochure for the 1972 model year, and updated the text as
&gt; needed.

That sounds like the ticket.  Anyone seen a brochure like this with an
earlier bay westy in it?  Something we could definitely pinpoint as 68
or 69?
