Subject: Re: [T2] Intake manifold for Holley 2 barrel/1600

Icing all depends on the weather,, humidity has to be near the dew point which
changes all the time.
Here in Southern Ontario Canada, typically in October we will see days that are
cold enough, and humid enough to get icing to occur... the rest of the winter
will be too dry to develop ice.
A heat chimney works somewhat to get warmer air into the carb ,,, that is a
paper hose that allows the air under the cylinders to be drawn into the carb .

It is still not the best of carbs....

&gt; Oddly, the 71 with the progressive pinto carb was used in Syracuse and
&gt; NJwinters; had no probs with it icing.  It sat on the stock preheated
&gt; manifold.  As I recall I also used the dreaded 009 with it......
