Subject: [BP] What is this-Is it a compressor??

Since it's Friday, I thought I'd challenge the list geniuses to try to
figure this picture out. It looks to me like a homemade compressor, but why
would it be in a Bug? The more I look at it, the more confused I get. Look
at the electrical apparatus in there. It looks like too much work to be a
dummy, lots of wires etc.

Mandatory bus content: I finally found a place in St. Catharines Ontario
that can balance wide 5 rims, but they can only bubble balance them. They
had a dynamic adapter, but it broke last summer. I'll go for the bubble
balance, it's better than nothing for my 4 new Conti CR21's.
