Subject: Re: 7 or 9seater owners - addendum

Karl pointed out that I should add some details; my bus is a NON
walkthrough, and does NOT have the sparetire well in the back.
Answers so far include:
fabric-covered masonite
rubber-backed charcoal grey mat
metal-edged fibreboard

perhaps all three were used at different times?

I lean to any non-cloth covered solutions, as water and oil etc tend to get
back here :)

Hey, while were at it - how does  YOUR back seat attach to the walls?  I
have seen L-shaped  brackets that screwed straight into the sides,
eye-hooks like the ones that hold screendoors shut, and a combination
eye-hook and black metal bar......   Mine is not hooked on right now, which
the dog likes, as he gets to lean back and look cool.
