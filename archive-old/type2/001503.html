Hmm, must have 'woids' with the Italian list members &amp; have Guy 'wacked'.
Selling a pair of heads shipped out to the US, fitted with good valves for
$99 EACH that's less than we pay in the UK for standard complete heads! They
had better be for uprights or I'm on a plane &amp; still saving money!!!!!

Ho-hum _at_ least you have not found our new everlasting source of  German
engine gasket sets, as good if not better than original!

Less than £10 too, read &amp; weep.

Andrew
