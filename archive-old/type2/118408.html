Hello,

time to prepare for the next big move.

My beloved bus is for sale.

It has been a source of daily transportation and a tireless camping
companion. my mobile reading room and my family house during summer trips.
I looked after it the best I Could and had a great deal of fun, playing
aging hippie and mechanic.

I think it is a GOOD BUS

see for your self

Thanks for the help and the good times.

Andrea
