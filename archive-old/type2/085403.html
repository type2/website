Subject: Re: [T2] [friday] Regarding &quot;Deadhead/hippie&quot; buses...

Sean Fulkerson sends:

&gt; Y'know... I've been thinking about this whole &quot;Deadhead/hippie&quot; bus
&gt; thing for the better part of today. And the more I think about it, the
&gt; more I realize that if it weren't for the &quot;hippie&quot; acceptance of the VW
&gt; bus, the bus today would be no more popular (or interesting) than an
&gt; old Ford/Chevy/Dodge/whatever van.

My parents had a split-window that they sold when Dad got promoted to GS7 in
the Bureau of Public Roads and they could afford a car with heat. In West
Yellowstone, Wyoming, that's important. They're not hippies; they bought the
Bus because it was the cheapest thing they could get that would haul four
kids.

Later, my aunt &amp; uncle bought a standard Loaf with the middle seat; they
bought it because it would hold seven kids.

I bought my Loaf because of all the Pink Floyd albums in my collection--it
is against the law for someone who owns &quot;Piper at the Gates of Dawn&quot; to buy
a Dodge Caravan. (It's in the NC General Statutes. Really it is.)
