Subject: Electric Fuel Pump Relay

Thinking that it would be a good idea for the fuel pump to shut off when the
engine stops, especially in the event of an accident, I have been following
the thread and considering how to do this on my bus. (74 T2/T4 Carb) Has
anyone tried running a hot lead to the relay coil, then grounding the other
side through the oil sending switch? Seems to me that would do the job, but
I could be wrong. Wouldn't be the first time. (Maybe the third time)
((Today))
