Subject: Using a lot of oil, looking for recommendations.

Hi all,

Long time lurker, not much to say, as my 81 air cooled runs pretty well, and
I don't use it all that often...

Anyway, I have a serious oil consumption issue, and would appreciate some
insight. Been asking this, around other forums, so I hope its not too
redundant :-)

Got about 200K on her. Compression is in the 100-115 range, and the spark
plugs look just like the pictures in the text books, for clean burning and
no signs of oil, of consequence.

No leaks on the ground, yet lots of oil used when driving around. Sometimes
a quart in 100 miles, sometimes a quart in 300 miles. Always worse on long,
freeway trips. It keeps fresh oil in the engine, which is good :-) but
expensive, and not all that friendly to the earth I guess.

I am not all that familair with the design and layout of the 2L air cooled
engine, so I am looking for things to check and seals that I can replace
without dropping the engine, or killing myself, assuming that the oil is
pretty much blowing out of the engine when under a load. No sign of any
great amount of oil film on the rear hatch and glass, but still, since it
doesn't drip on the garage floor, and the plugs seem decent, I am led to
think its blowing out some seals.

Any suggestions on how to proceed, and what I can do without a major
overhaul?

Much obliged for any insight.....

John
