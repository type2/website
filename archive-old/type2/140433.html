Try N90078802 at Bus Depot.  It's not the braided hose that was originally

&gt; I've been looking high and low for a piece of hose that will work to span
the
&gt; gap between the decel valve and the plastic pipe that fits into the
rubberY
&gt; fitting at the intake plenum. This is for my 80 Vanagon.
