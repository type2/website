Subject: Re: [T2] re: Hubcap is stranded in KANSAS!

Sigh,

You know, in a country with 300 million people, you would think there  
would be *somebody* imaginative enough to come up with unique place  
names. But the town I was born in is named after the town of  
Scarborough in England, so Canadians aren't any better. There's also  
a London, Paris, and Woodstock just to the West of Toronto. In fact,  
I carried the hubcap through Woodstock ON when I had custody of it,  
en route to Grand Bend, ON where I handed it off at the VW Northern  
Nationals. From there it went to BNNTA in Missouri, and after that  
the trail gets fuzzy...

Thanks for straightening that (me) out.

Happy trails,

&gt; Are there any list members in the NYC area who could rendezvous with

&gt; nice to see the hubcap head out to the west coast for a change.

Greg, and others, the hubcap is in the mid-west in Manhattan, KS, not
Manhatten in NYC ;)
