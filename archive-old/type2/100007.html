Subject: Re: [T2] Sportsmobile

--I've seen the Fresburg Sportsmobile from the 99, and wondered too. Also, I've seen Westfalia service type trucks, and recently a shop with the logo as well.

What are they doing now? Their name is paired with someone else's but I can't remember it.

There is a Sportsmobile van conversion company here in Fresno, Calif
