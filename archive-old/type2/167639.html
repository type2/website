Subject: Re: [T2] how to raise the rear part of the sliding door

&gt; It seems like the rear part of my sliding door is slightly low.  The
&gt; obvious thing to do would be to raise the catch, but I noticed (even
&gt; when it's at its lowest point), the locking mechanism on the door still
&gt; hits the catch, &quot;bounces&quot; over it, and then latches.  Does that make any
&gt; sense?
&gt;

I had a similar problem, now I am trying to remember what I did,  the
Catch block can be moved, if you loosen the few screws on the catch you
can tap it up or down slightly to adjust it.
