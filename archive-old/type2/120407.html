Subject: Re: [T2] bumper

&gt; Question Bill asked me:  was their a half-year
&gt; introduction of the new bumper in 73 or do all 73's
&gt; have the new bumper with step inside?  I told him
&gt; all 73's to my knowledge and that they need to
&gt; change their listing to 68-73 and 74-79.  Am I
&gt; right?

The bumper was changed exactly at the modelyear change
from 1972 to 1973. This must have been in July/August
1972 counting in calendaryears.

So there was no changeover. The dogleg was changed at
the same time from 'no step' to 'with step inside'.

So I suppose there are two front bumpers:

old type: modelyear 1968-1972
new type: modelyear 1973-1979


yours,

Vincent
