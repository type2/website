Subject: racing steering wheel

Anyone replaced the huge steering whell with something smaller 
and more car like? Do you have to do too many turns on a smaller 
wheel. Just a case of changing wheels over or do you have to 
adjust other things as well?

Better to drive?

Any hints for reversing a Kombi, only driven once and finally got my 
own bus. I have been told reversing is hard at first
