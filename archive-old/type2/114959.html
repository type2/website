&gt; Hello there.  I'm a newbie to the list, having recently bought my first VW, a
&gt; 1976 2L auto Kombi camper.
&gt; 
&gt; There has been some correspondence on making a tool for the 17mm Allen key
&gt; plug.  I have found that the outside of a 13mm tube spanner is just over 17mm,
&gt; and a quick dress with a file brought it down to size.  Also, when pumping or
&gt; handling 90 grade oil it sometimes helps to heat the oil first.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks for a great list.

I can easily locate this 3/8&quot; drive 17mm socket for $4. Anyone that needs
one can pmail me, pay me via paypal and I will mail you one for the cost of
the tool and postage (should be about $1) within the US.
