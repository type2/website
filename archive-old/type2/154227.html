&gt;&gt; I was shopping over the weekend and came across a specialty store
&gt; selling Garmin GPS devices. They've come a long way since I last looked
&gt; at them a few years ago finally offering pleasant color touch screens.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Does anyone have any experience with them to share?
&gt;
&gt;

Buy the Garmin, they have the best software and its all about the 
software.....I have the 660... awesome...
