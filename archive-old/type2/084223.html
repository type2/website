&gt; &gt; Tonight's question is what should my manifold vacuum be at idle?
&gt;
&gt; I like mine to be over 15&quot; at 8-900RPM  on most gauges with premarked
&gt; dials, this is the bottom end of acceptable, or maked &quot;late ingintion
&gt; timing&quot; and it is true... by the standards of water cooled engines, our
&gt; timing is very late.  On most engines, the timing spec is to advance it
&gt; 'til it stumbles, then back it off a bit.  If you try this with a VW, you
&gt; will toast that pup in minutes!
&gt;
&gt; &gt; I am getting 14 PSI on my gauge connected with a T into the vacuum
&gt; &gt; port that supplies the fuel regulator.
&gt;
&gt; I think this is the right place... that line goes to the air dist box
&gt; between the runners for cylinders 1&amp;2, yes?
&gt;

Actualy on the 75 air dist box Its Right behind the runner for Number 4, just
above the large connection that goes to the brake booster.

&gt;
&gt; &gt; Question 2 is my distributor vacuum connected to the correct port on the
&gt; &gt; throttle? It's connected to the port facing the rear of the bus on the
&gt; &gt; throttle body. There is another facing the front that is capped off.
&gt; &gt; This is a 75 FI setup
&gt;
&gt; Hang on, let me check.... (runs down to look for his spare throttle
&gt; body...)  drat... can't find it and the vanaagon has too much crap in the
&gt; back to pull it apart tonight...
&gt;
&gt; OK, I *think* you have it correctly connected, but to be *sure*, do
&gt; this...  hook your vacuum gauge to each of the ports.  One will have a
&gt; high vacuum at idle, dropping like a shot duck when you goose the
&gt; throttle.  This is manifold vacuum and would go to vacuum *retard* if you
&gt; had it.  The other port will have minimal vacuum at idle (2-3&quot;) at idle,
&gt; and will rise quickly when you goose the throttle.  That one is ported
&gt; vacuum and goes to the vacuum *advance*.  OK?
&gt;
&gt;

Thanks Steve, Ill Check it out tonight. Im just trying to do everything I can
to keep the engine as cool as possible. Arizona gets way hot in the summer.

Tom
