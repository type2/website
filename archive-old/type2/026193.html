	And from what I could see, the points were/are not flat against each
other 
	since the gap I do see appears (oh so very slightly) not an even
gap; when 
	opened, one edge of the set of points are closer than another edge.

On at least one occasion I have found it possible to set the points without
having the plate fully seated.  This may not be physically possible on all
distributors but what happened to me was that there is a little post on the
distributor plate and a corresponding hole on the points plate and if you
don't get the post in the hole everything is a bit cockeyed.
