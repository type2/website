Subject: Re: [T2] Cylinders Stuck to Cylinder Head

I'm picturing the cylinders and head all stuck together and removed from the
engine in 1 piece...
Had this problem before on a type1 engine and was able to soak it in a
trough a buddy of mine had filled with diesel fuel. Kerosene would work
too... you could use a rubbermade container of some sort. I'd probably soak
it for a week or so and then see what happens. Good luck.

Thanks,
Mark
