Jan:

It sounds like you had a stuck hydraulic lifter, causing looseness in the
valve train.  This is pretty common on these engines, particularly when
they accumulate a lot of kilometers (miles here).  I have a 79 which does
this a couple of times a year and it always goes away after a few minutes
of driving.  I don't think it is a serious problem since mine has been
doing this periodically for the past 8 years.  You could try to figure out
which lifter is causing the problem, then pull it out and clean/rebuild it.
