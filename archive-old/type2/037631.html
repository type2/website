Subject: Re: Heat shield?

I'll get the old heat shield out of the trash and take some pics of it
with my trusty Polaroid that I just remembered I have. Will post ASAP --
when I scan the pics at work tomorrow.

To describe the piece, it's a flat piece ~2 to 2-1/2 long with two
brackets sticking up off it about 3&quot;, each with a small tab/bend at the
ends. The bend has bolt holes where it attaches onto the tin. The flat
piece is straight on the rear edge and has a curved bit taken out of it
to clear the fan shroud, and a smaller notch for the oil filler tube.

BTW, I took a hammer to the muffler to clear for the oil filler tube and
it works great and is very easy. I did a lot more hammering than I
really needed to do, I guess, because now I've got about 1/4&quot;-1/2&quot; inch
of clearance all the way around. The R&amp;R of the muffler was easier the
first time, though! The VW gods got their share of my knuckle this time.

&gt; Hey Nikki! If'n it's not too late, could you take a digital photo of that thar
&gt; heat shield and send it to me?  I guess I don't have one since I have no idea
&gt; what it looks like.  With a pic maybe I'll be able to spot one some day at a
&gt; junk yard...
&gt; 
&gt; If it's too late and you've already installed it, don't sweat it - I'll keep my
&gt; eyes peeled for one anyway.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks!
