I searched the archives but didn't find any info to explain it.  I have a 
hard time with the search engine for some reason....

Anyhow, I changed my sparkplugs this weekend and on my #1 the spark plug was 
all oily.  It was even oily on the rubber gasket thing that slides down the 
spark plug wire and covers the hole the spark plug goes into.  It looks like 
oil got through the threads somehow ??
Other than this my bus runs fine.
Does this mean my seal is bad on that one cylinder??  Will a compression 
test tell me whats up and how long it will last till I HAVE to replace it?
