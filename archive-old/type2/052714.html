Subject: Re: [T2] driving with louvers open?

I do it all the time.  Well, in the summer that is.  The biggest problem is
when you stop and walk into the end of them with your shoulder.  Ouch!

&gt; Is there any problems asociated with driving a Westy with the long side 
&gt; louver windows open?
&gt; 
&gt; Just in case I ditch the rear vent wing.
