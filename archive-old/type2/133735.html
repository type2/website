Subject: Re: [T2] Getting that darn fan off

&gt;From: &quot;Tom Young&quot;

The large bolt and washers that thread onto the end of the crank will serve
as your &quot;press&quot; to get the hub back on; a flywheel lock is real convenient
here so you can get the correct torque on that bolt without the crank
spinning on you.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Any ideas on how to do it with a Flex Plate for an Automatic? Is it possible 
to get the torque without seating the hub all the way? I am about to do this 
myself. I guess I could pull the flex plate off and install a flywheel since 
I am going to put in a new seal anyway.

Thanks,

Michael Knight
