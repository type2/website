Wow! - I never expected this to generate so many replies - probably over
a dozen - Thanks for the help.  About half said they never had to resort
to other than hand pressure and the other half had to or typically used
some force.  I used an old pushrod tube and a rubber hammer and set them
easily with one or do light blows. Worked great.

For the record, my heads were rebuilt and clean and the block was
professionally cleaned.  I had new pushrod tubes and viton seals and I
lubed them. The bores were also lubed.  It is possible that rubber seals
would go in more easily, perhaps the same for older tubes.  If I had
known the amount of thread this would generate I would have tried it just
for general knowledge.

Thanks all
