&gt;The info in the Muir book isn't sketchy at all. John Muir specifically says
&gt;to stay the hell out of the transmission. He says you have to be in practice

Jim:

OK, maybe it is impractical to rebuild my tranny completely by myself, but I would think that I could do most of it, and take it to a machine shop to do the things that need tools I don't have.  As VW owners, I think many of us have a &quot;do-it-yourself&quot; approach to things, and I'm continually amazed by the creative solutions to problems that our list members come up with.  Of course, if I do try this tranny re-build thing, I'll buy a housing for a tranny and all the parts, and work on it in the garage while I drive with the original one.

So, does anyone know of a good tranny re-building book or video??

Thanks,
