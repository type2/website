Subject: BUS PARTY/Gawk  August 17/18th (!Florida)

(insert sound of trumpets.au here) THE SECOND ANNUAL LOVE_BUG OFF (flagwav.mov)

Yes VolkFolks, it is almost time for the next best thing since Garlic Pickles.


SITE:  O-Leno State Park
        http://www_dot_dep.state.fl_dot_us:80/parks/northcentral/oleno.html

WHEN:  August 17th and 18th (with people coming in as early as Fri.the 16th)

WHY:   Hey, we're bus folk. Where else we gonna look comfortable pulling out
        all the tents and spice racks and cute little stuffed plushies?

WHYNOT: ????

STUFF: Low key, but basically we're gonna have a swap meet and meet meet on
        Saturday along with obligatory frisbee tossin and river swimmin and
        BBQ'ing or vegie grazin, basking in the sun (tho it's mostly woodsie)
        as well as nature walkin and fishin (bring yer permit).. Great for
        the youngins less interested in VWs than we are.
       Sunday we're renting,dragging,borrowing a bunch of canoes along with
        packing some great grub for a cool water spring picnic while we float
        down the beautiful Sante Fe River... `Bout a 6 hour float and at the
        end (Rum Island) we'll catch a ride back up to our waiting vehicles..

CONTACT: Me  (Busbones_at_praxis_dot_net) Let me know who and how many (we're getting
        a reservation on their &quot;Group Site&quot; which will accomadate 140 of us
        with our vehicles.) That way we can spread stuff out and not bother any
        of the Un-Volkswagen folks. I need help organizing foodstuffs and misc
        stuff (any EastCoast Marthas?) as I don't put my salad forks in the
        proper place (ever!)
