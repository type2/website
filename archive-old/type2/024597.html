Subject: Best Carb / Distributor setup
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

I have a 1700 cc type IV pancake engine in my 73 Bus with a single weber
carb.  I have had some timing instability of late and I'm thinking about a
new carb and distributor.  What would be the recomended combination for my
engine?

TIA
