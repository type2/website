Subject: 1972 Bus alternator HELP...

Alternator harness on a 72 bus...question:
Black plug goes into the back of the alternator; other end of the
harness has an identical black plug which goes into the voltage
regulator.  I'm pretty clear on this part.
Where do the other wires on this harness go?  The big red one goes to
the starter?  If so, where on the starter?  There is a much smaller wire
on the end that plugs into the regulator that looks as if it plugs onto
something else.  Where does it go?

Sorry if I seem ignorant, but this is my first bus restoration.

THANKS!
