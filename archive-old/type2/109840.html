&lt;&lt;  She's really into Scooby Doo and insists that the Mystery Machine is a

Volkswagen Bus. She showed me several pictures she has and says.. &quot;If you

had that spare tire on the front, it would look more like it&quot;.  &gt;&gt;

My guess would be the Scooby Doo writers &quot;probably&quot; want the MM to be
as close to a VW Bus as possible without actually having to pay VW for
the use of their copyright...They're doing the same thing with Maynard
G. Krebs...(You rang...?-)
