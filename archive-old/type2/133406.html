&gt; I am trying to adjust my valves and #3 intake wont adjust.  Can't the feeler

sounds like that valve is sunken into the seat, or the shaft has stretched
either one is ripe for &quot;any second now&quot; catastrophic failure.  I would not
even turn the engine on, push or tow it to where you can pull and replace
at least that head....

it can be a $200 repair now or if the valve lets go a $2,000 new engine.

ask me how I know........
