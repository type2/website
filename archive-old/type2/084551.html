Subject: Re: [T2] Oil pressure adjuster - opinions?


If the source of the problem is a weak/worn pump, putting it under higher 
load will not buy you much time. It will just continue to wear faster and 
it's already on an exponetial rise to failure. Fix the motor before you 
destroy it's value as a core for rebuild.
