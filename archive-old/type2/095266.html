Subject: Re: [T2] vacuum booster check valve ?

Actually, the primary purpose of the check-valve is to prevent a backfire 
from destroying the booster's diaphragm.  Positive pressure would be a very 
bad thing...

	Eron



&gt;Yes.  Having a broken check valve will not cause a vacuum leak if the
&gt;system is tight, BTW.  The purpose of the check valve is to retain some
&gt;vacuum in the booster after the engine has shut down.  This keeps the
&gt;vacuum assist working for a couple brake applications after your engine
&gt;dies in traffic so you can stop safely or so you can keep the bus from
&gt;rolling if the parking brake does not hold, etc.  If you can leg press 500
&gt;pounds, you can probably live without it, but if not, it can be important.
