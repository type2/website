&gt; ????? I have one of the plastic ones on mine now but when I got it there
&gt; was a metal one there it was white with black tic marks and a red dot at
&gt; the timing point...unfortunately the coating wore off and it is pretty
&gt; much unusable now but I still have it..what was this on originally


Maybe. VW has been shipping black plastic ones for a good 7-8 years that I
know of, but perhaps they started off metal and then VW changed them. I can
say, though, that the black plastic ones are genuine VW, and if VW made a
metal one for a type 4 engine, they haven't made it for some time.
