&gt; Wrong! I had a set of 14&quot; wide 5's, stock 6&quot; on my '64 40hp 13 window
&gt; deluxe. These might not have come on it originally, but fit perfectly
&gt; with later radial tires on them(1975-77). Bruno got better mileage and
&gt; handled like a dream with that combo on board.
&gt;

Well, you totally lost me on the 'Wrong!' part.
Exactly what part is WRONG???
You said you had set of stock 14'' wheels on your 64 bus.
I said 14'' came on 64 to 70 buses.....

&gt; &gt; &gt; sell?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; An extra set of 15'' wheels to fit what??
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; You have a 68? 69? bay, correct?  They only came with 14'' wheels. 64 to 70
is
&gt; &gt; 14''.
&gt; &gt; 63 and back split buses came with 15'' wheels.
