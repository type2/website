78 T-II, all stock original. Motor is in fine condition, compression good,
and running very well. 

Starts cold and idles perfectly for 45 seconds ±, then dies. Will restart
fine but then not idle for 2 or 3 minutes until warm, then all is good
again. This symptom is repeatable and consistant over several months now.
During event, all the following have been verified. Fuel pressure good,
temp sensor new, bypass valve tested nominal, all ignition components good,
pulse from ECU to injectors is good, AFM is young and functional, no vacuum
leaks. Mixture is right when warm.

What am I missing??????? Has anyone had this symptom???
