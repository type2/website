Dear Listees,

Karen and I left Bartlesville about 12:15 Friday afternoon to attend Josh's
funeral in Ponca City, 70 miles to the west of us.  The weather was turning
nasty, very windy and starting to rain.  A really miserable day to attend a
funeral.  We didn't drive the bus as I don't have the heaters hooked up.  I
was planning to have the engine in Hannah by now so I didn't bother with the
heaters when I R&amp;R'd the engine this past summer.  Anyway, we drove the
Mercury Grand Marquis, with plenty of heat ;-).  We got to the church about
15 minutes before the service was to start.  I saw Charlie Ford and Rick
Taylor sitting on the front row about four rows ahead of us.  The place was
really beautiful with lots of flowers and many people there to pay their
respects.  I can tell you all, as much as Josh was a part of our lives via
the list, you can imagine how many people actually knew him.  It was a very
large crowd.

Josh's casket was made of beautiful oak.  There were lots of flowers as
well.  Sorry, Steve Dolan, there was no chance to verify that your flowers
were there.  I'm betting that they were.  After the family was brought in,
the minister said a few words of brief introduction.  You will all be
pleased to know that the &quot;List&quot; got mentioned several times throughout the
service.  The minister turned the  podium over to Josh's brother, Jeremy.
Jeremy put together a multi-media tribute to his brother using Microsoft
Powerpoint.  It was a slide show with music from when Josh was a baby to
just recently.  The starting music selection was Steppenwolf's Magic Carpet
ride.  In my book, any memorial service that starts with that kind of music
can't be too much of a downer.

When the service was over, I met up with Charlie, Rick Taylor and Pete
Sottnik.  Mike Gensler and Art Long were also there.  The funeral procession
was pretty cool.  Immediately following the hearse and family cars were five
busses.  First in line was the Mothership then the &quot;High Karma Westy&quot;
formerly belonging to Joe Fournier, now owned by Josh's friend Chad
Cantwell.  It was driven by Rick Taylor as Chad was one of the pallbearers.
Art Long, Mike Gensler and another westy followed Rick.  It was raining and
cold at the cemetery.  Really a sucky day for a funeral.

After the funeral we changed clothes at Chad's house and about forty of us
met at El Chico for dinner.  Josh used to manage that place.  After dinner,
Josh's father-in-law hosted a party in Josh's honor.  Chad's dad has a barn
with sort of an office included in it.  There were a couple of kegs of beer
and it was a time for reminiscing about Josh.  Many of the people there were
Josh's &quot;dune buddies&quot;.  Really a great bunch of people.  They were all so
close, I know they will be there to support each other and Josh's wife,
Rachel.

At the party it was my pleasure to meet fellow listee Mike Gensler.  I kept
telling people that I wanted to meet this guy Mike from San Antonio.  I
didn't hear his last name until I finally got a chance to introduce myself.
When he said &quot;Mike Gensler&quot;, I felt like Yeah, I know you!  And he the same.
Such is the power of the List.  

I am really glad I got to go.  It helped me put it all together.  Josh had
problems that he obviously felt he couldn't handle, but don't let that take
away from all the good things he has done for us and others.  Seeing how
Josh affected all the people around him, I know that he was a special
person.  I for one, would like to remember him that way.

Karen and headed home about 11:00 p.m.  Driving was tough at times due to
the fog and rain, but we made it safely.

Charlie and Rick will also be writing trip reports.  Hopefully they will
cover anything that I left out (put the pressure on you guys, huh?)

We were told by a co-worker of Josh's that his site will be up for at least
six months.  I like the idea of a &quot;Josh Rodgers Memorial Library&quot; on the
list.  Also we were told that the PowerPoint presentation by Josh's brother
will be made available.  I don't know the details, but possibly a link from
his page so that it can be downloaded.

People, I have made so many friends that I haven't met in person (yet), that
I would be at a loss if our list went away.  Nothing is permanent.  Not
servers or people willing to volunteer to do all the hard work to make this
list work.  It has to be a labor of love.  I would like to urge everyone to
please think twice (or three or four times) before posting to the list.  Is
your post adding to the collective?  Is it harming anyone?  Is it necessary?
Save the bickering for your private stuff.  I really would hate to lose you
all!

Merry Christmas, Happy Hanukkah, Kwanzaa or whatever you celebrate!

Be nice to yourself. Be nice to your bus.  And above all, be nice to others!
