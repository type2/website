&gt; Much hotter than any other part of the engine. I don't recall the coils in 
&gt; my other cars getting hot, though that may just be the placement in my 
&gt; bus... I brush against it whenever I reach into the engine box.

Well if you keep the ignition on and the points are in the closed
position that causes current to go through the coil. When the coil
gets constant power it will get hot. This might be all it is.
