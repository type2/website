Subject: sliding door sanctity

&gt;(I suppose this question could be interpretted as flame bait. If so, 
&gt;don't take the bait. I happen to think the sliding door is great for 
&gt;panels and carrying lots of people, or tools, or whatnot, but it's a 
&gt;turkey for camping)....

Whoa! You mean to say you don't treasure the wee-morning &quot;screeeeeeccchhh&quot;
as you open the door to take a leak at your campsite? What better way to
wake all those folks in nearby RVs? ;-)
Seriously, I don't see why the double doors would be preferable to the
slider when camping. Maybe I'm a creature of habit, but I have learned to
love, and lovingly lube, my sliding door.
To each their own.
Jeff
