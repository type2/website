Subject: Vanagon top speed

Just as a matter of curiosity, what kind of top speed do you Vanagon jockeys
get, especially the campers?

My 81 auto tops at 68 with maybe 70 downhill which is fine for me but it
seems to be less than the cruising speeds I see claimed for the late buses in
particular. Realistically,  I feel like it's working awfully hard over 60.
