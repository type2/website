Wow!!  This past weekend was great camping.  I finally had a chance to 
bind with my 15 year old boy.  Unfortunately, it will probably be the 
LAST!!!  He has finally discovered g%rls ¿ ¿ and fast cars.

So, I would like to offer my Blue/Orange drive-away tent for sale. Grey 
floor.  Red/Blue/(White) striped tent door.  A standard bay window tent.

The tent is in excellent shape, but the frame structure has one crack, 
plus one repaired crack.  This frame would need some personal attention 
to repair the crack.

I will not ship, since there must be tons of listees in the NOVA area 
that would love this tent.  I just want to let someone else have a 
chance at a drive-away for a few seasons.  

It is set up in my garage right now, airing out after the rain shower on 
Saturday night, ready for inspection and packing. 

Again, I WILL NOT ship the tent.  Sorry.

PS.  I also have (1) a beautiful waste basket seat (blue check, not 
green or orange or brown!!) with the ORIGINAL,  N E W  plastic bucket, 
WITH LID !!  for about $75, (2) a gorgeous '78 front axle beam (Beam, 
torsion tubes, and ball joints - a bare beam.  NO spindles or wheels or 
calipers.) for at least $100.  So clean that you can make a lamp out of 
it for your den, and (3) a black folding ladder (for the person who 
asked earlier) for $10 gas money (I will UPS only the ladder!!).

&gt;From the prices, you can see that I am only anxious to part with the 
tent.  The waste basket, front axle beam, and ladder are items that are 
NOT east to find.  I can't give them away.

Please reply to me at     pray4me_at_cais_dot_com    thanks
