&amp;gt; so i have decided since i have owned my bus for 7

&amp;gt; the passenger or slidding door. So i decided for the
&amp;gt; winter that was my project can anyone  recommend a
&amp;gt; service that i can send my driver,passenger and
&amp;gt; slidding door locks out and have the key work for all
&amp;gt; the locks any information would be grateful

You can take the door handles off, remove the lock cylinders by taking out
a phillips screw behind the cylinders, and then rearrange the wafers
within the cylinders to match your keys.

Be sure to have a key in the cylinder before removing the cylinder from
the handle to prevent loss of little bits!

It's not difficult, just time consuming.
