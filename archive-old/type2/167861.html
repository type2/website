Subject: Re: [T2] spring plate bushing replacement

Also, the only lubricant you should use on the bushings is talc (baby
powder, and make sure its not the cornstarch variety). If you omit the talc,
they will squeak for a while.

Bently shows the brake line passing through a hole in the spring plate and
requires that you disconnect the brake line to remove the plate; I found
that on later models than 1971 there is a slot rather than a hole, and the
plate can be removed without brake line disconnection and associated
bleeding, thereby saving a couple of hours on the job. check for this before
you disconnect the brake lines.

If you are proficient and have the required tools and parts at hand (a
magnetic protractor *http://tinyurl_dot_com/2j3hd6 *is a big help) and a level
place to work, you should be able to complete the task in a matter of 4-5
hours. That's best scenario.

Do the math twice, not the adjustment. Don't try to adjust the springs on
anything but a flat surface. A floor jack can bring the plates back up to
the stops, but be careful you don't lift the bus off the jack stands.

&gt; &gt; Has anyone ever replaced these?  I'm told it's not that big of a deal.
&gt; &gt; What am I getting myself into by doing this myself?
&gt;
&gt; There are four bushings, inner and outer on each side.  That means that
&gt; the spring plate has to be removed from the hub and the torsion bar to
&gt; replace the inner bushing.
&gt;
&gt; Bushing replacement is usually combined with torsion bar adjustment for
&gt; this reason.  Allow a weekend to complete the job.
