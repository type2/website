Importance: Normal

A few weeks back, I added a new Empi dual exhaust to Gretta, my '72 (thanks
to Rob _at_ 72camper_dot_com for the recommendation, and to Ronnie _at_ Old Volks for
the great price).  The easy install, and improved ground clearance
 are great, but I have already started to get quite a bit of surface rust,
which will obviously only get worse.  I would like to stop this (or at least
slow it down) before it becomes a more serious problem, but don't know where
to start.  Has anybody had good luck using high temp paints on their exhaust
to stop rust?  Anybody have any experience with the Por15 high temp stuff? I
know I shouldn't expect to get more than a couple of years out of a low cost
aftermarket system, but it does seem that I might expect a bit more than one
summer before the rust sets in...  please help.

							Thanks in advance,
								Jay
