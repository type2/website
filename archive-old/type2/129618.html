Subject: Re: [T2] More foam seals - engine compartment

Yep - going to have to look for that 1000 deg rated Phoenix edition water noodle. Wait - - - can't have water to play in in Phoenix with 1000 deg summer days... &lt;grin&gt; 

Sure wish I was a measure twice, cut once guy. Then I'd feel confident about cutting up the proper part... &lt;grin&gt;

Thanks! 

Chris





Forget the hardware aisle and head over to &quot;Sports&quot;. I was thinking 
about trying a poly-urethane foam &quot;Swim noodle&quot; in this application. 
Buy a 3&quot; diameter noodle and slit it lengthwise almost to the centre on 
both sides.
