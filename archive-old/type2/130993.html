Subject: RE: [T2] AIRS UPDATES: An new idea

I disagree on this one. I think there are a ton of people, like my friend 
Dirk ('67 deluxe) that are on the AIRS list that are NOT on any of the 
mailing lists. Also I've seen people on the AIRS list that aren't even bus 
owners, they are into other aircooled VWs and such and wouldn't be on the 
bus lists. And then you have the same problem anyways, some individual 
manually creates the pages on the site and all the data has to be manually 
inserted/edited/deleted.

I do agree on the idea that the AIRS lists needs to be database driven. So 
users could add/edit/delete their info in real time, instead of relying on 
some poor soul who updates the html pages manually. The current info could 
be parsed out and inserted into tables, or manually added if need be.  Then 
from that people could not only print out users per state, but could search 
based on a zip or area code or what not so if someone was only going to be 
in N texas they wouldn't have to print out everyone in the whole state.

I'm almost wondering if there's like a contact management system out on the 
web we could use for this instead of having to create something from 
scratch. And I just doubt there's currently someone out there with the 
skill, time, and motivation to make this happen for AIRS.

&gt; &gt; Hmmm.... Seems like the easiest and most accurate
&gt;way to update the list is to dump all of the data and
&gt;ask everyone to sign up from scratch again. Send the
&gt;request out to all three lists. Whatdoyathink?&lt;&lt;
