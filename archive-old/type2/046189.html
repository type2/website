Subject:  Re: [T2] Painting Engine Cases

Once upon a time when I had a brand new Kawasaki 500
H1 3 cylinder motorcycle (kind of dates me, I guess),
I painted the cylinders and heads with flat black
crinkly paint that was applied from a spray can, in
very thin coats, and then baked in the oven at a
specified time and temp.  The paint held up well, but
don't know if it really did much for cooling.  As
mentioned, it looked neat.
Regarding other colors, some colors are almost as good
as black (in regularly available types of paint) in
absorbing solar heat, and I would think that the
radiating characteristics would be comparable.
Back when I was doing more with passive solar heating
systems, it was surprising how well some colors worked
instead of flat black.
