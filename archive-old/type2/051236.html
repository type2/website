&gt; I'm looking to buy a VW camper, and have narrowed it down to two, each with

&gt; 
&gt; How much would each cost to repair?
&gt; 
&gt; Here's the deal on both of them...
&gt; 
&gt; Bus one is a '73 manual...  To quote the current owner: &quot;the engine needs 
&gt; rebuilt  because one of the rods broke. there is a hole on the top and back 
&gt; side of the block.  but i put lots of new parts on the engine before this 
&gt; happened, so there is much that is still usable.  the bus ran well/good before 
&gt; that incident.&quot;  How much would that cost to repair?  

About $1-1500 for an engine +2-400 core (which you will not get back based
on your description). $1-200 in miscellaneous bits if you do the swap,
$3-500 if a shop does the swap.

&gt; Is the engine salvageable at all, or would I need a new one?  

That engine is dead.  really dead.  You need a new engine.

&gt; How much would it cost to be rebuilt?

If there is a rod thru the case, then odds are good that a piston broke up
and circulated bits of piston and ring thru the engine.  I would re-use
*nothing* from inside that case.

&gt; The other is a '74 automatic...  It blew a head and the current owner was 
&gt; quoted $300 for new heads, and about $250 for labor to get it fixed.  Is this 
&gt; a realistic price?  

No.  New (read: rebuilt) heads are $200 per side.  If the shop pulls the
engine removes the old heads and slaps on the rebuilt heads, *maybe* $250
for labor, but that job will only last 5-10K miles, then you will be back.
If they do it correctly, more like $500 for labor. Total: $900-1000. And
*that* job will only last 10-20K, then you are back, because once the
heads go, the pistons and cylinders are usually not too far behind.

&gt; How much more would it cost to get the entire engine rebuilt as
&gt; opposed to merely new heads?

See above.  You might get your core back, but plan on $2000 overall.

&gt; All in all they're basically the same price, though the '73 is in FAR better 
&gt; condition, though neither is in horrible condition.

Then buy the '73.  You will need a rebuilt engine for either of these
buses.  I actually favor buying a nice body with a dead engine.  That way
I know what I have.  Plan on spending $2K on an engine, whichever way you
go.
