&gt;The PO of my 74 Westy (rebuilt 1800 with stock Solexes) decided he didn't like

&gt;neighborhood mechanic who performed some sleight-of-hand with the carbs and
&gt;told me of clogged idle cutoffs .. he then timed it to about 8 BTDC due, he
&gt;said, to the absence of smog gear.
&gt;
&gt;Does this (current timing setting) seem reasonable, or am I in the process of
&gt;burning her up?

Depends on your distributor.  If you have the stock dual-diaphragm
distributor with both vacuum hoses hooked up, 8BTDC is way too much advance
and could possibly harm your engine.  If you have an 009 or
single-diaphragm distributor it's probably okay.
&gt;
&gt;Also -- any potential problems with shifting to synthoil at my next oil
&gt;change?  Am running with 30w at the present.  TIA.
