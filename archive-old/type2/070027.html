Subject: Re: panel van vents

&gt;
&gt;the extra vents by the roof are common to all bench seat splittie panel vans
&gt;

A fellow told me about this the other day; then he told me that you could
identify a walk-thru by the absence of these vents. Then he told me where
there was  '56 walkthru panel for sale. I can't wait for my kids to wake up
so we can drive out and look for it. It's in Oklahoma...only about 200 miles
from Bob Hufford. If I see him looking for the lost treasure of Linden Lure,
I'll be sure to wave. ;) Joe
