Subject: Identifying the tranny

I seem to have a major comprehension gap with
respect to tranny's.  I'm trying to identify
mine, and I think I count five ribs whilst laying
on my back and feel the top of the tranny.  But I
also remember that something about the
&quot;rib-thing&quot; confused me... like you don't count
one or only count the ones that go all the way to
the bottom or only count on days when the moon is
full or something.  

Also, I thought the last digit was supposed to be
the year and that wouldn't make sense either, if
I do have a 5 rib tranny because the number is
&quot;2&quot; over &quot;00230103F.&quot; 

Can anyone help?
