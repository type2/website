Subject: re: VW wiring code info

Adam, et al:

Freaky.  I'm having the SAME trouble.  I've a 74 Super with serious ignition
problems.  One of the harnesses coming from the ignition switch has several
DIN terminal designations, and lo! they are just as you said, Su, X, etc.

I've been able to determine what 50, 30 and others are, but not the Su or X.
As to the website that someone posted, neither Su or X are listed.  Anyone
know what they relate to?  The &quot;Su&quot; terminal has a bare, cut wire leading
from it that I suspect is the origin to my ignition problems.
