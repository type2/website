Subject: Re: [T2] Switch on dash question?

&gt; I have an adjustable switch on my dash between the headlight switch 
&gt; and the steering column that I'm not sure what it is for...

Does the Switch have a symbol on it that looks like a fan? Can it put in
three positions when you turn it? In that case it is the Switch for the
Fresh air blowers. There are two of them in your T2. 
Where are they? Just follow the plastic pipe that goes down behind the
two fresh air outlets on your dash. The plastic pipes go down into the
metal tube. The fans should be behind the metal plate with the screws in
it.
