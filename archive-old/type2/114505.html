Subject: Re: [T2] classic info needed

As far as I know, it's business as usual. Free car show entry with paid 
admission has always been a nice perk for me. They have never had a year cutoff 
like this year's Kelley Park since they have lots of room. I plan on being their 
with my 70 westy and setting up tent!
