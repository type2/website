Subject: Re: [T2] uggh.  cv boots.  again!

&gt; it's been a long long long long day.  a really really bad long day.

Sorry to hear about that.  I had the same experience with my boots and 
they annoy the #_at_$_at_ out of me.  I didn't have a chance to order the ones 
George recommended so I am chancing it with some German ones again.  I'm 
keeping my fingers crossed ;)

Mike
