Subject: Re: CO detector vs. Brittany Spaniel

Yesterday I pulled off a 15 yr old dansk heater box from my 71 westy 1600 motor,
it looked like new outside but when I blew into one end and held my palm over
the other end of the exhaust pipe, it had a big leak in there.

The clue was a faint one-cylinder noise in the heater when I engaged the left
side only, and fumes under deceleration or full throttle only, left side only.
Under clean cruising it didn't smell much, but it made my brittany spaniel
sneeze.

(Welsh coal miners had parakeets, we Bus drivers need to have a good ol' hound
dog to sniff that monoxide).

I had previously gone over the outboard connections and even wasted time welding
on the lower flanges trying to fix the problem.

On the 1600, it is easy to pull these boxes even without removing the muffler,
and next time you do a muffler it's time to pull them and check them.

In my case, I was installing a new header and single quiet pack muffler (I
picked the expensive S&amp;S system) and did not have time to redo the welded
flanges.  What to do, I pondered.  Finding some bug heater boxes handy, I found
that you can rig the upper bus-type control arm with a rear axle nut cotter pin,
a small hose clamp, some 3/8 copper tubing, and a loop of baling wire.

Procedure to convert lower arm-controls to upper arm, other side is just slip
the cotter pin over the control arm as close the pivot as possible, then clamp
with the hose clamp about 2 inches of copper to the cotter pin, this anchors
your cotter pin to the arm at the same time because you are pinching the pin
around the arm while you clamp the copper pipe on it.   You have the arm now
extended up and crossing over the top of the heater box right where your bus
cables are ready for it.  I simply punched a hole with a nail through the copper
tube, poked wire thru and looped onto the original cable clamp device (cylinder
with 8 mm bolt to pinch the cable).  After the loop of wire goes around the
clamp, you can even move the clamp up and down the cable barrel to adjust the
movement.  While the single hose clamp is a little fragile, it you used two per
side that will make it real sturdy and voila, you can use the bug heater boxes
for the 68-71 bus.

The problem with cheaper dansk heater boxes is mine were never alligned right,
had to put mulitple gaskets on the stud end and work them into fitting the stock
muffler before tightening them into a looser fit onto the gaskets just to make
them fit at all.  Earliest force-fitting (attempting to bend using a bar inside
the exhaust pipe to attempt at bending it into shape, then setting it up under
strain) probably lead to cracked heads as well as the cracked pipe in the box;
or it was a flaw, there was no corrosion and that tube is very thick.

This thing had leaked for years, no wonder I have no brain cells left.

&gt; First you have to realize (I'm not saying you don't) that exaust pipes go
&gt; through the heater boxes.  That would be my first guess as to where the
&gt; fumes could be coming from. When I first started running the heat in my van
&gt; it kinda smelled like exaust too so I went and bought a CO detector (which I
&gt; highly recommend you do... at $20 a pop just call it cheap life insurance).
&gt; Needless to say it never went off and after running the heater every day for
&gt; about a week the smell has diminished.

&gt; &gt; What is the most likely cause of the fumes?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; As I understand it, the fresh air flows through the engine compartment,
&gt; &gt; through the fan, where it is pushed out the heater hoses into the heater
&gt; &gt; boxes (heat exchangers), then through the ductwork up to the vents on
&gt; &gt; the dash board and elsewhere in the cabin. If there is an exhaust leak
&gt; &gt; somewhere in the engine compartment, those gases would get sucked into
&gt; &gt; the fan along with the fresh air.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; The seal around the engine door is a good one, as is the seal around the
&gt; &gt; back of the engine by the pulley. The front seal has some problems, but
&gt; &gt; it seems to me that the front of the engine is the least likely place for
&gt; &gt; exhaust gases to collect. Is it more likely that there is a manifold
&gt; &gt; problem?
