Robin,

As the very poor owner of a '71 Westy for the past 15 yrs or so I got ta tell
ya, your never gonna find a more economically forgiving year range!  I would
doubt that I've never had to put more that $500 at a time into &quot;Janis&quot; at a
time!  Been through about 4 engines and I've often regretted never being able to
put the kind of money into her that she deserves, but the &quot;Busma&quot; is so strong
with her that she has always forgiven me for the neglect and has always gotten
me to where I needed to go, ..... eventually.

Earlier models are much more difficult to find the parts for and latter models
engine parts cost about 4 times more when ya do need 'em.  The price sounds
fairly reasonable but despite the money the current owner has put into
it/him/her has to be counter considered against the need for the expenses, the
wear and use they have gotten from them.  Also the work that is sounds like you
will need to put into it should really be taken into account and lower the price
for a fully functional Camper!  If the repairs you described were not needed the
bus would be worth about $1500 min.

Go For It!  The &quot;Busma&quot; will reward you for years and repay you 100 fold!!
