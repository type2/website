Rick:
Interesting that you should say something about the 30,000 mile service interval on
the rears. I've never heard of it. (But there is a lot I've never heard of.)
Also, in all the hundreds of thousands of miles I've driven them, I've never
repacked a single one, nor replaced a single rear bearing. They must be quite up to
the task!
(It's been my guiding philosophy- The squeeking wheel gets the grease!- Sorry, I
couldn't help it.) In fairness to some, I live in the rust belt and at 170k, my 82
diesel Vanagon is the highest mileage I've ever seen on a car. Usually bodies rust
away before the chassis is too worn out.
Hell, I've only ever put ball joints in 2, my 69, because I put in a new beam and
had all the parts off anyway and a 72 that sat for a long time and the boots got
cracked first.

&gt; All this talk about front wheel bearings, does everyone know that VW
&gt; suggested packing the REAR wheel bearings every 30,000 miles?  Those rear
&gt; wheel bearings take more of a beating than the front ones do!  They carry
&gt; more weight and have the torque of the drive train added to them.
