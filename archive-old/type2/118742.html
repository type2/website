Subject: Re: [T2] Flywheel cleaning &amp; starter bushing

If the flywheel has no &quot;burn&quot; spots (blue/purple heat discolorations) and
has no significant grooves in the working surface (i.e., if you run a
fingernail along the surface you don't &quot;catch&quot; the nail) then it's probably
OK.  I'd just clean it up with some paint thinner or kerosene and a rag,
allowing everything to dry thoroughly before reassembly.  If you've got the
engine out then replacing the starter bushing is easy enough, just along the
lines you've proposed.

Subject: [T2] Flywheel cleaning &amp; starter bushing


&gt; Greetings,
&gt;
&gt; '79 2.0L FI Westy
&gt;
&gt; What should I use to clean my flywheel? Brake cleaner? How do I know if it
&gt; needs machining? It has been about 55k since it was last machined and
&gt; balanced.
&gt;
&gt; Also, it has been a long time since I replaced the starter bushing. How do
I
&gt; do this? I remember it ibeing easy. Do I just drive it out with something?
&gt; Seems like I remember soaking the new one in oil? before I installed it.
