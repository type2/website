Subject: RE: Canvas Replacement Idea

	Here's an idea for thought.  I was considering having a local
repair/sew
	shop  use my existing canvas as a pattern and use a nylon material
	(similar to tent fabric) to fabricate a replacement piece of canvas.
My
	thought is that the nylon would be a better insulator against the
wind
	than the canvas.  In the winter at 10,000 feet, the wind can be
pretty
	strong and darn right cold at night.  Anyone see any obvious flaws
with
	this idea.  If you're interested in what I find out, let me know.

	Does a pattern exist for the canvas already????

	Pete, I leave the top down at night ever since I had a wind storm
come in while I was sleeping at about 9,000 feet one night.  Woke me up and
scared the heck out of me!  I think the top would have either ripped off or
acted like a sail and tipped the whole show over if I hadn't taken it down
when I did.  Even tried to take the top after it was fastened down.  I could
actually see the rubber hold-downs stretching.  

	Anyway, I wanted to use a heavy duty marine grade acrylic fabric
(made for boat covers, waterproof and never fades) in a specific color for
my pop top.  I talked to a couple of sewing shops, but didn't get the
confidence that they would be able to do a good job.  I finally ended up
shipping the fabric to a canvas pop-top maker that cranks them out all day.
Paid a little extra to use my fabric and was guaranteed it would fit.  Very
happy with the results.  

	Incidentally, I did the same thing with my door panels, shipped them
my (higher grade) vinyl and they cranked em out along with the cheaper
reproduction ones they make all day.

	As far as wind protection, any good fabric sown properly should keep
out the wind.  If you go with a nylon, use the ballistic type that is rated
rip proof.  Some nylons don't stretch enough and can actually be more prone
to rips when fastened to a rigid structure like the pop-top.  Some nylons
also are noisier in the wind.  Many nylons are also not very UV resistant
and can break down if exposed to a lot of sun.  A rough textured nylon
fabric might even rub the paint off the roof below the pop-top when it's
down.  On the other hand, a good nylon can be stronger and lighter than
fabric, and dry very quickly. Check with the manufacturer for water, rip,
UV, etc ratings.  Don't think there's a noise rating though!   If you do go
the sewing shop route, be sure they are familiar with the material and they
know how to properly sew it-properly spaced stitch patterns, locks, etc, and
that they use the right thread.  No sense having a pop top made out of
Superman's cape if the thread soon falls apart!  Good luck.
