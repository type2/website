Here's one. Please call Cedar about this, not me. I looked at it today, 
but didn't feel like this is the one for me.

In Eugene OR, 541-484-2759. Cedar is the owner.

1965 VW van. $740 because he's going overseas and wants to sell it 
soon. He says it runs good, and it started immediately. The engine leaks 
some oil (no big puddles underneath, but it has oil on the bottom). The 
interior is a swap from a camper, but wasn't in good condition. Floor 
mats were in place. Looking underneath, the only rust showing was a 2 
square inches, and it didn't look like it went through. The engine 
puffed a bit of oil smoke when started, but didn't smoke noticably when 
running. Idle was proper, valves sounded good, no burned valves or 
noticable clatters.

The interior has twin buckets (stock). What I could see of them looked 
good, but they were mostly covered in UGLY fake fur covers. Window seals 
are all bad, but the floor mats didn't look bad. One cracked front 
screen, but a replacement in the back. The front end was bondoed years 
ago, then was hit again (no bumpers). I'd quote 20 hours on nose work, 
but it's nothing the average guy couldn't fix in his home shop with some 
care. The worse part of it was the side bracket that supports the 
bumper... it was bent and torn, so some welding would be required. The 
&quot;dents&quot; pushed in the front sheet metal, but didn't alter any of the 
structural members. Even the headlight buckets were not moved out of 
alignment. One headlamp cover was missing, and the ring was dented.

Total rust redo, about 5 hours, and the patches are small enough that 
you could use scraps of metal (no replacement panels needed). There were 
a couple small bubbles under the paint on the driver's side... could be 
cancer rust, or could be bubbled paint. It's been repainted dark brown 
over the original red. It looks like it's only been repainted once.

It has a head temp guage in an overhead wooden mount. No major 
butchering of the dash, from what I could see. He said the windshield 
wipers didn't work. I didn't check it out long enough to see what other 
electrics might be bad. He says it has a new battery.

All in all, it's fairly clean and has been driven recently. With a fix 
on the wipers, it looks like it could be driven most anywhere.
