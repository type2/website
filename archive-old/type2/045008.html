Yes, although I think I have read in certain manuals that the changeover from 210 to 215 occurred midyear in '73 (model year or calendar year?  I'm not sure).

&gt;76 and up use a 228. You hafta use the
&gt;flywheel/clutch package that goes with the bellhousing that's in the
&gt;bus, or you can also swap a later bellhousing to use the larger 228mm
&gt;gear in the 74 and 75 tranny. (Check the archives for specifics on
&gt;your buses year. Searches for 228mm and 215mm worked for me)

Just to be clear, the 210 and 215mm flywheels and clutches will fit inside all 72-79 bellhousings.  The 76-79 flywheels and clutches will only fit the 76-79 bellhousings.  I have heard that you can do some grinding on the 72-75 bellhousings and make the later flywheel and clutch fit, but I have never tried it.  You can also bolt a 72-75 bellhousing to a 76-79 tranny with no problems.  I am fairly sure that the starters are specific to the bellhousings.

&gt;My friend choose to use new 215 stuff instead of swapping the
&gt;bellhousing with the one from the donor bus that supplied the engine.
&gt;Concerns about smaller clutch surface area were discussed, but he
&gt;wanted to get the bus back together quickly. These things happen when
&gt;you have a Boston Bob newly rebuilt 2.0L sitting under the bus.

It's not such a bad thing.  The 215 is a noticeable improvement over the 210, if you had that to start with like I did.  Also, the 76-79 bellhousing is about 1/2&quot; larger (deeper) than the early one.  It's a small difference - within the limit of adjustment of the tranny and engine mounts but just barely.  That kind of thing bothers me.

&gt;Oh...  and don't forget the exhaust system too. Even though the 79
&gt;2.0L engines have square port heads (one year exhaust), the 72-74
&gt;muffler fits fine (w/o Egr and Cat on my 79). 75-78 is the other
&gt;exhaust group, so this has to be considered too. (Busdepot's new
&gt;catalog is a great resource for students of bus exhaust). 

I wonder how the port mismatch affects power?  I'll admit it's probably not a big problem, but I'd try to correct it eventually.
