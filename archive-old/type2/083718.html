Subject: Engine Removal Question

Well this weekend Troy &amp; I will be doing two R&amp;R's on our two busses.
We thought it would be a good time to do a side by side comparison of
engine only removal &amp; engine/tranny removal. that aside. Here's a
question for the engine/tranny camp. Without unattaching the axles how
much movement should I expect to get from the tranny? That is if we
lower the assembly as a whole to seperate it on the ground how far
will the tranny be allowed to drop before it stops b/c of the axles,
and will that be enough clearance to get the engine out? Thanks we'll
try and document the differences we see &amp; post back.
