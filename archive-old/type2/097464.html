Subject: Re: [T2] Is 20w50 Oil OK in the winter

&gt; Is 20w5 Oil OK in Winter? I drive my van almost exclusively
&gt; in the summer and have always used Castrol GTX 20w50 Oil.
&gt; Now it is December, temperature is just below freezing,

Chris-

You're likely too get a lot of differing opinions on this. I also use 20w50
in the summer but I feel it's a bit stiff for starting at temps below
freezing. I dropped to a 15w40 and now the bus starts a lot easier on cold
mornings.

That being said, if you're only going to use the van for a couple of days
while moving, the 20w50 will probably be OK, just be sure to let it warm up
thoroughly before starting to drive.

Regards,
Dave
