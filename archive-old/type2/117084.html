the scam with these is, is that the check will clear but get kicked back
about 6 weeks later

heck, just deposit the check and see if it clears, if it clears send him
the VW if not turn it over to the local authorites as &quot;Check fraud&quot; in one

personally I would use the check to open an account, when the check clears
withdraw the money and redeposit in your real checking account
