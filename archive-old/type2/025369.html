&gt; I agree kenneth.  Wade is the backbone of AIRS and has put mucho work into
&gt; making it a success.
&gt; 
&gt; How could we make it more &quot;user printer friendly'?
&gt; 
&gt; Wade, any ideas?

I'm not Wade nor do I play him on TV. However! I am a typesetter by day and
night (sometimes all night), so if y'all want a printable AIRS PDF and Wade
is accommodating, if Wade can send the following to my e-mail address:

The AIRS lists in text format
Logos, maps and other graphics
Anything else you might want in there

I will whip up a nice tight little PDF suitable for on-screen viewing,
printing on laser (it will even have the extra margin on the left side
you'll need to print it on three-hole-drilled paper without cutting off the
words) and inkjet printers and even burning to CD-R and giving as gifts.

All for free. With updates once a month.
