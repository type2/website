&gt; Quick question... Does anyone have any idea how the charcoal canister
&gt; (bolted to the roof of the engine compartment on the right side)
that I

It isn't so much a filter as a storage vessel for gasoline fumes. 
Fumes from the tank are absorbed by the charcoal and sit there until
the engine is run.  Air is then pumped from the fan shroud, through
the canister, and into the air cleaner.  The air takes the gas fumes
along with it.

I've never heard of one of these being clogged or replaced.  It
wouldn't affect the engine if it were.  It might affect gas tank
venting, but that too is a heck of a long shot.
