Subject: Re: [T2] AC/DC setup for an AC only fridge

----- Original Message ----- 
From: &quot;David Hopkins&quot; &lt;david_at_hopkinsherald_dot_com&gt;

&gt; I bought a standard fridge froms Lowes, and put it in the van.
&gt; If the switch is on, I want it to draw from DC....  if i plug in the
&gt; AC, i want it to automatically cut off the DC and on the AC..
&gt; thoughts?
&gt;

Hi David

Here is a drawing that may help...
http://www.globalserve_dot_net/~jrivers/pictures/invertor-charger.bmp
 it allows you to power an invertor [changing the DC from the batteries to 
the AC] that is connected to what ever load. The invertor is taken out of 
the circuit as soon as there is shore power present.. automatically....and 
keeping the load powered up,, now from the shore power... and at the same 
time.. a battery charger is connected to bring the batteries up to charge.

When the shore power is removed.. the circuit reverts back to power thru the 
invertor from the batteries.

I recommend using a &quot;smart&quot; charger...  http://tinyurl_dot_com/npwyx
if that doesn't work.. try http://www_dot_canadiantire_dot_ca   search Product# 
11-1513-8
That charger does what it says.. 2x faster.. 2 amp, 8 amp or12 amp rate... 
you can select deep cycle or standard battery.. etc... but the nice thing is 
it tells you in percent charged..  where a voltmeter may say 13.5 volts and 
the battery capacity is toast... you may think you have a good battery..
this charger takes temp, rate of  charge, level, and other things into 
effect.. and displays in percent!
I love that charger...

hope that helps
