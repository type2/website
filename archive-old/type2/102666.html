&gt; Hi all:
&gt; 
&gt; I've separated the large cooling fan from the pulley it's attached to in
&gt; order to clean things up and paint the pulley.  The van is attached to the
&gt; pulley via 4 bolts with &quot;triple-square&quot; heads, similar to CV joint bolts.
&gt; 
&gt; Does anybody know the proper assembly torque for these bolts?  I can't seem
&gt; to find it in Bentley.


we just beat up on this issue and found 42ftlbs seems to be the correct
number
