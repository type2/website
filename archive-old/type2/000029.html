Subject: ball joints
Message-ID: &lt;0.34285105.254fa0a9_at_aol_dot_com&gt;

I have been keeping my ball joints going by greasing them but I am soon going 
to have to replace them since the boots are torn (really almost nonexistent). 
 How big a job is it?  What does it entail to do both sides?  How long should 
I expect to spend?  I have manuals but would appreciate any advice, hints, 
pitfalls that await before starting.  Both sides, upper and lower need 
replacing.
