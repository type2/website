He is trying to get the lights to go ON.

&gt;         5) Bet you a nickel &quot;G&quot; means &quot;GROUND&quot;, but the person who sold
&gt; you the sender ought to be able to tell you. No papers with sender OR
&gt; gauge?

Dual sender, I believe that G = Gauge &amp; WK = Warning Light (K is for the
german Lamp)

&gt;
&gt; &gt;While turning
&gt; &gt;the engine over with the points disconnected from the coil, the oil
&gt; &gt;pressure was not comming up.  After 45 seconds of cranking gauge reads
&gt; &gt;approx. 8 PSI.  BUT, neither the gen or oil light were on.  I don't want
&gt; &gt;to start the engine without oil pressure.  The dual sender is marked &quot;G&quot;
&gt; &gt;and &quot;WK&quot;.  I'm assuming &quot;G&quot; means gauge.  I even reinstalled the factory
&gt; &gt;sender and still no lites.

When you first turn the ignition on and without turning over the engine, your
Oil light and alternator light should be ON.  After cranking and developing a
few lbs of oil pressure, the oil lamp should turn off.  Once the engine
starts, the rpms will be such that the alternator/gen will be able to start
start providing a voltage that is greater than the battery voltage.  At that
point, the alternator light will turn off.

This sequence insures that your warning lamps are functioning and not burnt
out.  If you cannot get past the first step with the lights on without
cranking the engine, fix that first before going on.
