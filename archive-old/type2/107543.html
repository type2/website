Subject: Bessie Goes to the movies--with a date !!

Bessie was again at the movie set for the making of &quot;The Rainmakers&quot;.  This
shooting featured a lot of Hippies-and gunfire--Even this Old Man was used
as an extra--Which was really cool being surrounded by some very nice
looking Hippie chicks. My nickname on the set is Papa Hippie !

This time Bessie had company-- a very cool Double Cab was also used. The
owner is Jon Stanton president of the Arizona Bus Club--The driver was his
daughter Michelle, who was also used as an extra in the film--and really
looked Vantastic !!  Stay tuned--
