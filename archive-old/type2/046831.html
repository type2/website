Subject: [T2] Addendum to Muir

Bussers,

&quot;How to Keep Your Volkswagen Alive&quot;, the so called &quot;idiot manual&quot; by John
Muir, is a subject of much discussion on this list.  This book has been an
important factor in my interest in VW's, and cars in general.  However,
there are some errors, and questionable editorial content that may lead some
would-be mechanics astray.  My aim is to have a concise one page document
that can be inserted into the front of the book with the proper info.

Here is a synopsis of my VW &quot;career&quot;.  My very first car was a 65 B*g which
i bought in 1969.  It was cheap and reliable, what I needed at the time. I
owned it for a year.  But I had no mechanical knowledge then and no one to
teach me.  Fast forward to 1982.  Several cars and frustrated attempts at
car repair via Chilton type manuals later, I spot the Muir manual at a
bookstore.  Though I had no thoughts of another VW, I figured an idiot like
me might learn something about cars.  The writing was so refreshing, I read
the book cover to cover, some chapters several times.  I decided I'd get a
bus someday.  Got a 68 Westy.  Rod knock and electrical problems galore.
Interior was rough, but the body was solid.  Luckily, I found another 68
with a nice Westy interior, good motor, but very rusty.  With Muir guiding
me I did an engine swap and lots of other things I'd never tried before.
The bus burned up in 1988 gobbling up many worldly possessions in the
process.  (If I knew then what I know now....)  I threw away Muir and swore
off VW's forever.  Forever lasted 9 years.  Found the updated Muir.  Got two
1970 Westy's and did it again.  But now I have 10 more years of know-how,
Bentley, Haynes, Wilson, and the almighty Type 2 list.  This leads me to the
addendum.

This is not intended to be controversial.  I'm looking for things that are
regarded by nearly all to be major errors or omissions in the book.  In true
Muir form, it should be written so an idiot can understand.  Here is my
contribution:

Warmitup:  Don't sit in the car after starting any longer than necessary.
Drive off as soon as practical and keep your automatic choke.  Adjust the
choke seasonally if you live where there are seasons, so the car doesn't
over-rev when cold, and you can drive off less than a minute after you
started it.
009 distributor:  It's a widely available &quot;universal&quot; distributor but is not
necessarily a better answer than the stock one for your engine if you still
have it. It really isn't a good idea on Type IV motors.
Timing:  A static timing light is OK in a pinch, but you really should
invest in a strobe timing light for best accuracy.  If you installed an 009
distributor, set timing to 7.5 BTDC for any Type I motor, regardless of
year.
Valve Adjustment: Even if you REALLY don't want to work on your VW, study
this procedure.  It's perhaps the clearest, best instruction ever written in
an auto manual.  You need to adjust your valves yourself, when the car is
dead cold.
Engine Rebuild:  By all means, refer to Chapter XV, but get the book &quot;How to
Rebuild the VW Air-Cooled Engine&quot; by Wilson, and use both books.  In case of
a conflict in instruction, go with Wilson.

That's it.  I'm sure there's more.  Please P-mail me with suggestions.  I'll
collect them, Friday survey format, and post the addendum when the &quot;votes&quot;
have been cast. To paraphrase Charlie Ford, Thanks for tolerating my
ramblings.
