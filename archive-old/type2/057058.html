  Well now I feel like an idiot. I'm all telling the commuter guy of 15 miles
to GO FOR IT and I can't even get my engine size correct. I said I had 1500
SP, well it is a 1600 SP. It might not matter to anyone else, but it matters
to me and my Bus.
  So while I am here a have a few questions:
 1. I use to think it was because of longer trips that this problem would
occur,    (since the engine would be hotter) but it happened to me stone cold
the other day.
I got in the Bus. Turned the key and not one sound. Nothing. So I rolled it
backwards downhill and pop started it. Drove it back up to the top, turned it
off, tried again and it started on it's own. What is up with that? whenever it
has done this in the past it is the same thing. And once it happens it might
be months before it does it again.
  2. What is the best muffler I can get for a reasonable price? reasonable
being up to around 200.00. The Bus sounds like a sick Harley. ( Oh, I have a
1970 )
  3.Where can I get, and can they be installed, seatbelts for the backseat of
the Bus. I have a camper bed seat back there. 
                                                                           O.K
. Thanks in advance,
