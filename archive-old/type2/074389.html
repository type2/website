Subject: Engine Stand from Bus Depot

I am considering buying the engine stand that the bus depot has for my
type4 and I wanted to get input from others that have used it.  Can I
mount the flywheel on the engine with the stand still attached?  I have
a generic stand now that sucks because you have to adjust the arms to
match the holes and it's just a nightmare... plus I'd have to take the
engine off of the generic stand to attach the flywheel and clutch..

Any other good/bad points?

Thanks,
Mike
