Well, I have made another assumption and, of course, I am wrong. So, will 
someone please tell me, is  there a  difference between a  Deluxe, and 
Westy? I was under impression that a Deluxe and a Westy were two different 
types of transporter, but from the responses to my notes, I am thinking that 
they are the same. The reason for my confusion is that I have seen pictures 
of the different models produced by VW, and in these pictures they show 3 
different 'busses', a type 1 model 1, a type 1 model 2 (which I thought was 
the Deluxe), and a type 1 Westfalia (Westy?).

So, are the Deluxe and Westfalia the same?,  if so what is a model 1. And 
what is a model 2?, the model I have been told that I have.

          Pete
