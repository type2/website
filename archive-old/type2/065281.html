H Steven Dolan sed:

&gt;I have recently acquired both a Stewart-Warner Heater and a BN-4 Heater.
&gt;While both are reputed to work, I have no experience at all with these
&gt;beasts.  OTOH, it would be really, really nice to be warm this winter.
&gt;
&gt;Does anyone out there have copies of the owner's manuals, technical
&gt;manuals, and/or installation intructions for either of these units?
&gt;
As there have been quite a few questions about these heaters recently, it
is time I owned up. YES, I have a VW Service Technical Bulletin on
installing/troubleshooting these beasts. I will happily send a copy to
anyone who e-mails me their snail-mail address. All I ask in return is that
you send me a photocopy of some interesting old VW lit -- tech brochures,
articles, sales brochures, anything.
