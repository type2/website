Anyone know how much those instant polaroid cameras cost?  Maybe we
could
all chip in and buy two of them to be passed from bus to bus (heck, use
the
cameras as the baton).  That way, 1 or 2 pictures could be taken of the
participant and their bus for each leg of the rally and passed along.
Maybe
a diary book too.  Then at the end we could have the pics scanned in and
posted to a web site along with the diary entries from each participant.

Depends on which instant polaroids you mean - they have a new product
out - Pop Shots (disposable polaroid captiva cameras) which cost around
$20 pre rebate - you get a rebate when you send in the used camera (the
postage is already paid - polaroid supplies you with the mailer) you get
10 shots - a regular polaroid camera can average $60 and a pack of film
is $20 - one pack of polaroid film is 10 exposures - sometimes you can
get a twin pack for $20 - it would be cheaper and the images would be
better quality of you got a couple of the low end APS cameras - I've
seen them for around 10 dollars - the film is around 6 and processing is
another 5 to 6 dollars (maybe a little more) - image quality would be
better for the web - plus kodak could burn the images to CD for a
minimal price - just can't help myself when people start talking cameras
and photography (BFA in Photograpy, with emphasis on digital media).

But if it goes down Gia and I are at your disposal.
