&gt; Does anyone have experience removing the wooden interior roof trim above 
&gt; the driver's seat in a 1970 Westy?  The Bentley book does not take the
&gt; vent pipe for the sink into account.  Is there a way to temporarily remove 
&gt; this pipe to replace the plywood liner?
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks,
&gt; Gord

Hey G,
I just refinished my panels about a month ago. I just unscrewed the vent pipe from sink and then shoved the pipe up into the roof hole, rotated the pipe and kinda wiggled it out. It did break off about 1/3 of the lip underneath the threaded sleave but alittle superglue fixed that, good as new. Hope that helps. Good luck. Kim
