I just got off the phone with Tirerack and they say that is a miskey. The
salesman says the load is probably 1469Lbs rather then 2469Lbs. I think
he's still wrong since the Aegis LS4 is 1532Lbs for that size (205/75-14).
He couldn't find it in his yokohama book and it's not listed on the
yokohama website.

Seems like the best deal in that size is the Goodyear marathon Radial Load
Range C for $62 or you can go with the stock size (185/0-14) Yokohama Y356
Load Range C for $50
