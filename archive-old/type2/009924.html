I'm looking to buy a distributor for my 1600DP with 34-PICT-3 carb.  

Here's the part #'s for what I can use, according to Jim Thompson's web site:  

VW 211-905-205Q / Bosch 0231 167 055

VW 211-905-205S / Bosch 0231 173 001 

VW 043-905-205D / Bosch 0231 176 033

VW 113-905-205AH / Bosch 0231 167 070


I'm currently (less-than-ideally) using an 009, and may upgrade to a
nearly-worn-out single-suck advance distributor as soon as I resolder a wire or
two, and stuff new points into it.  

I am in CT, will pay shipping, all that jazz.  }:)  I'd *really* like to get the
proper distributor into Lazarus as soon as I can, tho.  009 lag is a pain, and
this single-vac distributor is a little too scarred and toasted to rely on.  

Any replies are welcome.  TIA.
