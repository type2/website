Subject: a quick question
Message-ID: &lt;Pine.BSF.4.21.0010251702460.55927-100000_at_zarf_dot_org&gt;

hello all,

I am putting a used 1500 single port with a single relief case in my bus.

It had a regular oil filter installed an i put on a filter pump insted.

Notwithstanding quality control issues with filter pumps (i have heard all
the pros and cons and gotchas..) here is my question:

The pump is of a high-volume design.  Will this cause problems since a
single relief case cannot limit the maximum oil pressure seen by the
bearings?

i saved the regular volume pump just in case (though i'd probably get
another one as this one looked pretty scored up.)

thanks,

Steve
