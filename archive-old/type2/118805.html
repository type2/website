Subject: Re: [T2] speedo repair

&gt; &gt;Or perhaps the issue is with asking for highly skilled, quality work for
&gt; &gt;&quot;VW&quot; prices?
&gt;
&gt; I doubt this list would exist if there wasn't such a DIY attitude wrt vw
repair and we wouldn't be having this conversation.

Vintage VW buses exist therefore there will be mailing lists for them just
like there are for every other make/model/brand of vintage vehicle. I don't
think &quot;DIY Attitude&quot; is a requirement for a list to exist! But most every
list will have some DIY'ers on it.

&gt; &gt;The VW community at large never seems to want to pay quality money for
&gt; &gt;quality work.
&gt;
&gt; And the reason for this is that VW parts are generally inexpensive
compared to the cost of repair related to many other makes and models. For
example, I can buy four new road wheels for $260 or spend a similar amount
getting them repainted by skilled labor. Or I can paint them myself in an
afternoon. Which way is better? I'm not trying to argue that here.

I suggest the cost of doing quality resto work to guages is about the same
be it a vintage VW Bus, Porsche, Ford, Fiat Etc., I would also suggest the
it is equally inexspensive to do &quot;previous owner from hell rattle can
restoration in an afternoon&quot; be it a vintage VW BUS, Porsche, Ford, Fiat
etc. Theres no real cost difference between the makes and models. Any cost
saving is a result of being cheap, thrift, frugal whatever you want to call
it. I would also suggest those road wheels are equally exspensive wether you
mount them on a bus OR ANY OTHER VEHICLE they will fit.

Regardless if you run a rat bus or a rat porsche rattle can techniques may
be justified.

Are complete brake jobs cheaper to do to a bus versus a 76 ford van, or do
all those brake parts cost about the same? Sure its a lot cheaper to just
rattle can your booster and armor all the hoses but that doesnt help you
stop
&gt;
&gt; If no spare part can be found in the area, by all means get the repair
done by skilled labor.
