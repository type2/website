Subject: NOS German &quot;quality&quot;

Thought I'd share some thoughts here.  I just recieved a set of NOS
1500 cc pistons I bought off a certain auction site (another great deal
as usual, even with the ludicrous shipping from the UK 8-) and was
very very anxious to measure these up.  Now I'm using them in my 2.0
liter Scirocco mill but they are Type3 1500 Mahle pistons, made in
the Fatherland with a 7/66 build date.  That is about as darn Dumbole
Methode as you can get in my estimation.  Frankly I'm really really
underwhelmed.  3 of the set (sealed NOS in the Mahle box in Mahle
wrappers) are relatively matched in terms of what I assume to be
casting lot codes.  But even these vary in diameter about 0.0006&quot; from
small to large.  Then there is the oddball, stamped with an entirely
different &quot;made in germany stamp&quot; different &quot;arrow stamp&quot; still stamped
the same size 82.95 as all the rest it is 0.0012&quot; bigger than the smallest
of the rest.  That folks is pretty ludicrous considering the piston to
cylinder tolerance for a 1500 is probably 0.0008-0.0012&quot; or so.
The pins are all gorgeous and match.  I rant this mostly to say that
&quot;Made in Germany&quot; even &quot;in the day&quot; doesn't seem a lot better than
made in South America &quot;in the day&quot; or even today.  In comparison I
have a set of MetalLeve 83.5's Steve bought to overbore his old 1500
jugs with.  I would in fact be using them but oddly set to set from the
1500 pistons (bus) in his engine to my NOS set of 1500 Type3 to these
overbore 1500 set the pin height increases some 2mm, and I can't use
the overbores cause I can't trim enough off the tops and there isn't
any shimming the bases in a Scirocco block.  Anyway I digress the
point is these 1972 date code MetalLeve, Brazil, overbore pistons are
SPOT ON, and I mean ON, like 0.0003&quot; variance across the set and
withing 0.2gm across the set.  The pins aren't as nicely finished, and
they came with an odd mix of 2 top rings and 6 2nd rings (but they
aren't really much different on the set admittedly) but the pistons are
right on.  So goes to say something about the legends of German
quality, I think you'd be hard pressed to run this set of pistons
in a new set of 1500 jugs if you had them, the big piston would be
about 0.0004&quot; clearance on a nominal bore.  For me as the block is
getting custom honed to fit, doesn't much matter.  BTW I've never
seen a Cofap or Mahle Brazilian set of type 4 pistons vary more than
about 0.0005&quot;.  The oddball also differes in pin height about 0.015&quot;
though once again I'm trimming them off so it doesn't matter.  The
ring set BTW (Goetz?) is gorgeous as well, just that one oddball
piston.
