OK, I'll take a crack at this one!  I was lucky enough to find a bus
that had escaped backyard engineering and made a diagram!

The port on the side of the distributor diaphragm toward the
distributor body connects to the port that comes straight out of the
back of the carburator (_not_ the port that angles upward!)

The port on the side of the distributor diaphragm away from the
distributor body connects to the port that comes out of the left side
of the carburator.

The port that comes up at an angle from the base of the carburator
connects to one of the ports on the throttle positioner (the gadget
that mounts behind the carburator)

The other port on the throttle positioner connects to the port that
extends from the end of the altitude compensator (the gadget screwed
to the side of the engine bay) opposite the adjusting screw.

Finally, the port on the rounded side of the altitude compensator is
connected to the port on the left manifold casting.

As you can see, the throttle positioner is a completely separate
system from the vacuum advance system and can be removed (and saved
for reinstallation when mandated by the smog nazis) without affecting
the operation of the engine.  The purpose of the throttle positioner
is to hold the throttle open for a few seconds after the manifold
vacuum jumps when the throttle is closed.  This keeps a combustible
mixture in the cylinders that burns relatively cleanly rather than
simply shutting off most of the fuel flow to cylinders which stops
combustion and increases unburned HC.  The altitude compensator serves
to keep this operation consistent with changes in altitude.

The vacuum advance sends a signal to the distributor that tells the
status of the throttle butterfly.  You _don't_ want the distributor to
advance whenever manifold vacuum is high!  When the throttle butterfly
opens, it uncovers a small port on the side of the carb throat and
exposes the port to vacuum, which then causes the distributor to
advance when the advance is needed.  A very elegant system, regardless
of what St. Muir has to say about it.
