Subject: Re: [T2] Oil Cooler Cleaning?

I doubt that cleaning out the oil cooler will provide you with lower oil 
temps. Your temps are most likely rising due to engine wear.

Get with the program, they all collect cotton wood seeds, lint and

pressure air or water.
If you got a small problem today its going to be bigger tomorrow.
