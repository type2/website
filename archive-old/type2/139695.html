Subject: Re: [T2] How many different A/C units were available for the
  type 2?

If I remember correctly, while at VPC, we made a *very* few &quot;executive&quot; 
A/C units for VW of Mexico which employed both the front and rear units at 
the same time.

It was along time ago in a land far away....&lt;grin&gt;

I still keep up with my buddy and old roomate who was the engineer on all 
the VW bus A/C units...but his memory is fading somewhat as well.

I don't know if DPD made the same variations or not.

Underdash or overhead didn't make any difference on engine type, just 
where could you mount the unit in the bus.  IIRC, most dealers prefered 
the overhead as it didn't complicate being able to get at things under 
the dash.

Cheers, dave

&gt; Anyone really know how many different AC solutions VW (and others) have
&gt; offered for the type 2 over the years?
&gt; 
&gt; When browsing I have seen 5 types of AC units in the pics and VW brochures.
&gt; 
&gt; 1) Front Overhead AC unit. (Overhead just behind driver / passanger seats.)
&gt; 
&gt; 2) Rear Overhead AC unit (Overhead behind the rear passengers, near the rear
&gt; hatch.)
&gt; 
snipped&gt; 
&gt; Anyone know how common or rare these variations are and are 1 &amp; 2 part of
&gt; the same A/C package or completely separate options?
&gt; 
&gt; I think the overhead units date back to the early models with upright engine
&gt; and the underdash was for the later type 4 engine?
