Subject: Re: Plug Socket, Dist, Points

&gt;Thanks for everyone earlier in the week who encouraged me to change my
&gt;points, condensor, etc by myself.
&gt;I wasn't able to get the distributor off my '79 Type II engine. Even with
&gt;an offset box wrench, even if I CAN get the wrench on the nut to the right
&gt;of the disty, I have no way to turn it. Does anyone have any tricks on how
&gt;I can get this thing out of my motor?


? I have a little ratcheting 10mm offset wrench that's really handy for
the job. I loosen the 2&quot; bolt and then remove the distributor. The clamp on
my TypeIV engine is not amenable to being removed, so I just pull the
distributor.

It's an awkward spot. Stick your head in the engine with your worklight (I hope
it's fluorescent) next to your jowls. Chickenwing your arm and bring your
wrench
in and put it on the bolt. Curse VW for redesigning the distributor
location. Curse
yourself for not buying a -71 instead...

If you're waiting for an important call, go stuff your head in the engine
compartment. It will cause the phone to ring.


&gt;What I ended up doing was changing the points while the disty was still
&gt;installed. It went OK, no screws dropped, and everything checks out OK:
&gt;dwell, timing, etc., except I couldn't get the condensor off. Is this a
&gt;big deal?

yes, you ought to change the points and condensor at the same time. I read
that in the Idiot Book and after several years neglected to follow that
advice when I had my 69 bug... found myself with my flashlight in my mouth
changing the condensor at 2 in the morning after work one night...

What do you mean you couldn't get the condensor off? Remove the screw and
take the condensor off the distributor. Right?



&gt;Now to the plugs: I bought an extended 21mm socket and went to town. On
&gt;the two rear cylinders, once the plugs screwed loose, they dropped on to
&gt;the block (?) and needed to be fished out from underneath the sheet metal
&gt;shroud that I can barley get two fingers into. I was able to do that using
&gt;a piece of looped wire and hooking the bent electrode and slowly pulling
&gt;them out (Don't ask why I didn't have my handy magnet tool). Now my
&gt;qyestion is how the hell I'm supposed to get them back in?! Is there such
&gt;a thing as a magnetized socket for these things? Did I buy the wrong tool?

  hahahahaha. Well, that never happens to *ME*!!!  ; ' D

  Stick your finger through the sheet metal to get some idea of the angle you
  need to match. It's insane. The idea was that the shooting ends of the plugs
  are better aligned for the engine health and welfare. Makes maintenance a
  PITA. See earlier comments on cursing VW and cursing yourself for not buying
  an upright engine instead...

  Persevere!!! You  can do it.
