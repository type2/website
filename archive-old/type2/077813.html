Subject: Re: [T2] someone save this bus


&gt; To the list,
&gt;
&gt; I found a 71 panel bus on the street in Oakland, Ca today. The city has tag
&gt; it for towing.
&gt; Trans is there, body is in good shape.
&gt; Hate to see it be crushed.

BTW, once they tow it, it becomes an abatement vehicle. It cannot be bought by
someone else and put back on the road. It can only go to a wrecking yard. You
cannot buy it from the wrecking yard and get a salvage title for it. It is
history...
75% of the vehicles in Fresno Pick a Part are abatement vehicles from the bay
area. I tried to buy some of them....
