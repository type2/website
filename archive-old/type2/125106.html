Subject: Re: [T2] Seats from Vanagon in Late Bay

Sorry Don,

They won't fit your bus...

The vanagon seats are the same format as the 76-79 buses, sliding in on the 
driver's side and bolting to the swivel if you have a camper or sliding in 
on the passenger side. Your passenger seat is that crazy removable setup so 
it's a no go. Don't believe the tracks are the same for the driver's side 
either.
