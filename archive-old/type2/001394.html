&quot;Hello,
        I've almost got my newly AVP rebuilt fuel-injected 2.0L in my
'78 Westy running, but am hitting some snags. I went to run it for 20
minutes at 2,000 RPM as per the Wilson book and had to really bring out
the idle air screw.&quot;

I think you may not have a problem after all. Getting the thing to run at
2000 RPM (I presume for the sake of mating the new lifters to the cam)is not
really meant to be done with the idle speed screw - it usually doesn't have
to go much over 900 rpm. Sometimes we'll set one up to a grand or even close
to 1100 to get the cleanest possible reading during a smog check, but rarely
(if ever) would we use the idle screw to try to run the engine at 2k. I
would use a &quot;Phantom Phoot&quot; if I didn't have a phriend handy (it's like a
caulking gun with an extra long plunger rod, to hold the gas pedal)... How
does it run at normal idle? Does the mixture adjust properly at closed
throttle?

&quot;Then even at the point of the screw almost popping
out, the engine would still only idle erratically around 2,000,
sometimes spiking up and never constant.&quot;

Could be air was sucking through the threads of the speed screw if you had
it that far out...

&quot;So I thought &quot;Aha! Vacuum
leak!&quot; and sprayed carb cleaner to every possible leakage spot along the
intake manifold I could think of without RPM ever rising appreciably.&quot;

If you still suspect a vacuum leak after setting up fuel mixture properly at
normal idle (per your engine compartment sticker specs, or somewhat richer -
I like to set a '78 around 1.25% CO or even a bit more. The factory setting
(.7% +/-.4) always seemed too lean to me.), have you blocked off all
possible off-engine culprits? Like brake vacuum pipe, decel valve, EGR
valve? All new fuel injector seals, of course... Happy hunting!
