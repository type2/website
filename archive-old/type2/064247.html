Subject: NY winter oil?

There has been a lot of discussion recently about which oil to use for the
winter.  I believe most of the info received had to do with a southern
climate.  Well I live in NY (western) and I would like to know what oil
to use this winter.  Anyone out there in this &quot;northern&quot; zone want to share
their secrets.  I will probably go with 10w-30 although I will continue with
my 20w-50 for a while yet.
