Subject: Re: [T2] eureka springs VW people

I SECOND THAT!!! i have been to the show the last 3 years and it is the
one time i tell the kids' dad that i am going out of town and he WILL be
watching the kids for me!!! i would miss the car show right here in town
if eureka held theirs the same day! it is the best show i've ever been to
and you cant go ANYWHERE in town the whole weekend without seeing VWs of
every shape, size and condition everywhere!!! it is AWESOME! and the new
convention center is GREAT! ventors are indoor along with the food people
and restrooms and kids' activities... used vendors are outside... if you
want a hotel, you need to get one early in the year (now would be
good)... but ANYONE is welcome to camp at the kettle campground with the
t-town transporters and the buskatiers... it's always fun!

i was talking to someone at last year's show and they were saying that
eureka always has something going on there... that particular time of
year was open and the two clubs needed a good place to hold a show, so it
worked out for everyone! so cool... anyway, just thought i would throw
that in, too... always something happening there.

wavin and counting the days til this year's eureka show,

town!
&gt; BTW, if you have spouses that aren't in to VW's, then they will love 
the 
&gt; town as it is a shoppers paradise with victorian type houses all  over
the 
&gt; place.
