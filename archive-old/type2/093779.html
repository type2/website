&gt; Hello,
&gt;
&gt; I recently purchased a 1972 van. I believe that the engine is not the 
&gt; original 1700. The reason being is that the oil dipstick sits on top of 
&gt; the engine (rather than out the back by the generator/alternator) to 
&gt; the right of the oil breather box. After a long search I found the 
&gt; engine number stamped diagonally on top of the engine by the bell 
&gt; housing. It starts with the letters &quot;EA&quot;.
&gt;
&gt; Can anyone tell me if this is an original engine for my van?
