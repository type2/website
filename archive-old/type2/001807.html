&gt; I just got my latest, a 79 standard.  I am going to change all the fuel
lines &amp; was
&gt; wondering if all of it is the same size ID line?  Also does anyone have an
&gt; approximate number of feet I should buy to do the whole bus?


Everything from the fuel filter onward is 7mm high pressure line. Use ONLY
special high pressure line or you are asking for a fire.  I sell it for
about $7 a meter as I recall, on my website. The VW dealer and a handful of
good import auto parts shops should also sell it. Typically it is smooth
jacketed and German made. You will need about 3-4 meters.
