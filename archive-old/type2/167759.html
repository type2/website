Subject: Re: [T2] dimensions needed (fuel tank area)

Michael,

http://www.shockwaverider_dot_com/78bustankjob/

Lotsa pics, but no dimensions.  If i remember correctly, it was a tight 
fit with the gas feed protrusions on the bottom.  Looks like lots of
room with the tank in there though.

Cheers, dave

  I want to build (or buy) a larger fuel tank and install it in there. Once you
  pull the cover the original fuel tank looks line a pea on a catchers mit.

  A picture or sketch with dimensions would be the best.
