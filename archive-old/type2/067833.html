Subject: Muffler leak

Hiyall,

Got a circular crack at the front right portion of the muffler,
where it attaches to the heat exchange part. But on the muffler
box itself.  Proper proceedure would be a little circular arc
weld, no doubt.  However, anybody know if there's a tube of
&quot;super goop&quot; that would seal this thin crack that DOES get
pretty hot ?

TIA,

p.s. It's the standard 2 pipe type muffler. Crack is exactly
     opposite the right-hand pipe (fif)
