Subject: Spot welding

Hey volks, I appreciate all the advice on how to imitate a spot weld 
without using a spot welder. But that wasn't exactly the question I 
asked. Maybe the way I worded the question was too ambiguous, so I will 
rephrase:

Why not weld spot welds with a spot welder?

Karl's reply was a partial answer to the question (sometimes you can't).

It seems to me that in cases where two clean flanges come together face 
to face, and it's possible to reach them with the electrodes of the 
spot welder, it makes sense to use the spot welder to reduce or 
eliminate distortion.

I'm not asking how to make lemonade without lemons. I'm asking: what's 
wrong with using lemons to make lemonade.

Mark
