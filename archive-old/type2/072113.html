You don't need any special tools to remove the dash and it's not difficult.
However, and this is very important, TAKE NOTES.  Lots of them.  Take
pictures as well if you have a camera.  If you don't note where all the
wires and screws go you will wish you had never taken it apart.
The dash itself is held in by a number of small screws along the front edge
and 2 large ones either side into the A posts.  You will have to remove the
radio if you have one, the plastic heater ducts, the handbrake lever (not
all of it), the heater knobs, and it is probably easier if you take out the
glove box as well.  Then you need to pull the instrument console out and
disconnect the wiring from the back and the speedo cable.  Then there is
the wiring to the dash switches and the heater cables to detach.  You may
need to remove the heater controls, in which case you can probably leave
the cables attached.  My memory gets fuzzy at this point, it is nearly 4
years since I did this... there will be other things as well.  You do not
have to remove the steering wheel but you do need to remove the screws that
hold the steering column to the dash.
Now would be a good time to repair any rust that you find around the
windscreen area!
