Subject: VDO Oil Pressure Sender

Well this is mainly for the archives but anyway. I can say without any
doubt that the vdo oil pressure sender will fit nice right where the
stock sender is normally. All that was required was drilling out the
hole that is there normally w/ a larger hole.

While the engine was out I decided it would be a good, no make that
great time to install a pressure sender. I really didn't like the idea
of an extention hose or pipe because of the problems associated with
extra parts not leaking. As it turns out the tin has some curvature
right next to the hole which makes for a great rest for a hole saw. I
used a 2-1/8&quot; bit but i suspect a 2-1/16&quot; would be even better. put the
hole saw in your drill press. let the side of it ride against the afore
mentioned curve in the metal. After drilling it out clean the edges w/ a
grinder wheel or file. Now after putting the tin in place the sender
fits nicely where the stock one was before. The only thing left to find
is some sort of large grommet to fill the space the sender doesn't fill.
All of this is on a 2 liter 1979 motor. It looks very nice &amp; eventually
it might make it to some sort or tech page, but that will have to wait
untill i can get my wife to let me get a digital camera.:)
