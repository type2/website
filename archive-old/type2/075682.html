Glen,

It has been 10 years since I have run a carb regularly, but what you
describe sounds like normal operating behaviour to me. Note that I did not
say pleasant operating behavior, just normal.

The way the automatic choke works is that it is a bimetalic spring in a
housing next to an electric heating element.  First thing in the AM, the
spring and carb body are the same temp as the outside air.  If it is warm,
the spring is unwound and the choke is open, if it is cold, the spring
winds up tight and the choke is closed.  When you get in and give the gas
that single slow pump, you (a) set the choke and (b) give it a shot of gas
from the accelerator pump.  Then you turn the key and (if everything else
is set up correctly) it starts.  In addition, you start feeding some
electricity to the heating element.  As that element heats the bimetal
spring, it uncoils and opens the choke.  After a minute or so, the choke
element is hot, the choke butterfly is open and the car is ready to go.

This is fine *if* you then run the car for 20 minutes or so and get the
engine all nice and thoroughly warmed up.  If you only go for 5 minutes,
tho,  and turn it off.... well, the element is hot, the choke is open, BUT
the engine is still cold and needs some choke!  By opening the throttle,
and pumping a bit, and then feathering the throttle you can get the engine
to restart, but it is a PITA.  It is however a normal PITA and just the
way that system works.

There are other down-sides to 5-minute drives as well.... mufflers rust
faster and you get mayonaise in the oil.  Basically, cold weather means
start it 10 minutes before you need it and let it sit and warm or plan on
round-about drives to the store :-)
