Subject: [T2] pulling my heads
To: type2_at_lenti.type2_dot_com

How long since the bottom end (crank, bearings, etc,) was rebuilt? The same 
55K, probably, so all should be good for a bit yet as long as you aren't 
getting the same bearing breakdown symptoms the other guy had (magnetic 
flakes in oil, oil light flickers at idle after a long run, etc). 

An oil pressure guge slaved in to the pressure plug would tell you something, 
but if you wash out the strainer into a clean rag and there's no big magnetic 
flakes, I'd just do the top end. Probably the case is fine. 

Cylinders, pistons, and rings may not be. You might want to do a compresion 
check all round before you pull heads. The readings on the three cylinders 
you think have good valve seats will tell you if you've any life in those 
pots. They will also show if valve trouble exists in other pots, which is 
likely, and confirm your diagnosis on the one bad seat. Slopping a little oil 
in the cylinders lets you know if the low compression reading is due to valve 
seat or rings. The reading goes up it it's rings, not if valves. 

New rings wouldn't cost much in time or dollars and add miles to the rebuild. 
Rebuilt heads might cost a lot, depends on the model and year. The cheap, but 
less certain thing to so is to grind in a new valve, if the seat itself isn't 
shot. You can usually just about tell by looking at the seat and comparing to 
the other seats. Slight out-of-round means a machine shop job at least, if 
not a new head. Look for hairline cracks by the spark plug hole, too, 
although they'll sometimes run for miles with one of these.
