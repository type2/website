Subject: Re: Cylinder Head Paint &lt;-- The Original Subject Was &quot;paint for
  cylinders.&quot;

It has been awhile, but back in the 1960s and 70s when
I was doing lots of work with motorcycles, we would
paint the cylinders and heads in an effort to improve
cooling, and the idea was to apply the thinnest
possible coating of paint, just enough to color it so
that the surface would be black and therefore radiate
heat better than the previous dull aluminum surface. 
We also anodized some things, seams to me dark blue or
black, but I don't remember much about it other than
having a problem talking the company into doing the
few motorcycle parts that we had.  We never did much
about running any real tests to see if the paint or
anodizing helped cool. We didn't have the parts, time,
instrumentation, or money!

The point is, that you wanted the lightest possible
coat of paint, didn't have to be a solid nice looking
coating, and certainly not multiple layers, because as
previously mentioned, paint makes a good insulator
(compartively) on air cooled engine cylinders. 

Come to thinnk of it, I thnk that one of my sons has a
1974 era Yamaha 350 out in the shed that came from the
factory with a black finish on the cases and
cylinders.  If it wasn't so cold and icy I might be
tempted to go out and look at it again. Maybe I'll
think of it in the spring.
