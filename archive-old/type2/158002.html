Subject: Re: [T2] Yet another Roadtrip!

&lt;&lt;Same deal with old British steel...The Royal Enfield, one of the
oldest 
bike companies in the world, is still being built in India&gt;&gt;

Still??

They never got the high sign went Indian / Enfield went Kaput to stop
production.

They must have missed the smoke signals that it was all over.

Like the Ural the Enfield isn't a bad bike, its just stuck in a 50 year
time warp---
They both make you appreciate the current technology &amp; advancements in
motoring about on two wheels.

It's very similar to owning and driving any older VW.

&quot;The vehicle's that time forgot&quot;
