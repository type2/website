Subject: Re: Locking gas caps and five speeds

Bow Wow in seattle used to carry locking gas caps.
not sure if they still do.. they had them less than
a year ago. Their site is worth a visit if for no
other
reason they have a good listing of VW events!;-)

5 speed eh? Is there a tranny out there that would be
a reasonably easy swap for the type 4 powered late
bays?
A source for the fabled freeway flyer?
