&gt; Speaking of HF, my motorcycle jack lost all of it's fluid the other day. I 
&gt; couldn't figure out where it was leaking from then I noticed that the piston 
&gt; under the release pedal had popped all of the way out. The pedal shouldn't 
&gt; really allow this but it's a cheaply made tool.

made in China  ???     Everything I see in HF is cheaply made  Best thing I 
have gotten there are the HVLP paint guns even then the regulator was bad   you 
get what you pay for   later and have fun  Mark Dearing
