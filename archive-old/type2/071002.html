&lt;&lt; I, too, have been using the Fluoramics, Inc. TUFOIL since '83 in my 
vehicles and
 have not yet found a reason to stop using it &gt;&gt;

Back in the mid 80's a friend of mine used this stuff in the engines in his 
31' power boat, a Chris Craft Stinger with twin Chevy 454's. Mercruiser 
recommended these
engines be torn torn down and rebuilt at approx 250 to 300 hours use, but he 
took them to well over 600 hours without any problems, and he ran this boat 
HARD ( 80
mph + on the Potomac river)                  Jeff S.
