Hey  thanks to you all out there that are looking out for my legal
safety.  I went to the guy yesterday and dropped the thank  you note and
the new check into his slot. I timed myself so that I would catch him
there but he wasn't. so  I also went to sears and filled a tool box
grabbed so material for the curtians. The BUS DEPOT kicks so much
tail-man I love it !  I pick up some parts on Monday and hopefully on
saturday I will get to put them in place(my lifters sound like a bunch
of marbles in a blender )  with my new tools woo hoo  gotta love a wind
fall. So after the lifters, pushrod tube seals, and valve cover gaskets
are replaced then I will be embarking on a smallish trip to see my pop 
in upstate P.A. 4hrs+  of driving. I will be swindling my friend who's
knowledgable with me in case of a loose fire extingisher or some
thing......
