&gt; Hello All    AAA also gets you the best discounts at motels and car rentals,
&gt; even better than AARP,

The bad news is that AAA-rated motels tend to have much higher prices than
the ones that don't get rated.  Motels pay a lot for that &quot;AAA&quot; sign.
Their quality is good, but sometimes the wallet strain is too!  :)
