It's actualy more of a cut `n' shut type of operation. You get an oversize
rod with a machined end and another machined insert that you put into the end
of the rod once it is cut to length. It's in BugPack packaging and looks like
it should work. My original has a conical end rather than the new spherical ones
but the radius looks similar.

&gt; I'd try and replace what you need from a scrap yard.

Anyone in the Surrey/Hants UK area know of one?
