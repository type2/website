Subject: Re: [T2] Anti-Seize



&gt; &gt;The 'anti seize on spark plug threads' thread has been over for a while, but
&gt; &gt;I have a new (to me) wrinkle to add. I was at my bearing supplier today and
&gt; &gt;saw &quot;Nuclear Grade&quot; Anti Seize which claimed to be good for temps up to
&gt; &gt;2600F. Now I haven't installed my Flux Capacitor yet but when I do, I'm
&gt; &gt;wondering if this stuff will hold up to the temps generated by 1.21
&gt; &gt;gigawatts of electricity.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Seriously, has anyone tried this type of anti seize on spark plugs? Does it
&gt; &gt;work or not?
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; I missed out on the earlier thread, and I've never heard of this super
&gt; stuff you're talking about, but here's my opinion on regular (Permatex, for
&gt; example) anti-seize compound.
&gt; 
&gt; I use it on everything:  spark plugs, body hardware, exhaust nuts, lug
&gt; bolts and nuts, etc, etc.  I just hate breaking off rusted bolts, and
&gt; anything which might prevent that is OK w/ me.  And when all threads are
&gt; lubed w/ anti-seize, I have a better chance of getting meaningful torque
&gt; readings.  I just put a brand new set of factory 16&quot; alloys on my T100
&gt; truck, and I sure wanted these megabuck wheels to be properly torqued.

I tend to agree, although I never use it on lug nuts/bolts.  I've never had one of these sieze on me and I really don't want to make them 
easier to get off!

On spark plugs, I make _very_ sure that the anti-sieze never gets close to the insulators or electrodes on either end.  I use a small dab 
located at least one thread in from the end.  Some have reported  misfires while using antisieze on spark plugs, but I've never experienced 
it.  Plug removal is always a fingers-only exercise once the plugs are broken loose.
