Subject: Re: [T2] fuel line question

Well, the non-Calif 'bird beak' [the right angle rubber at the top of the
filler pipe] does not have a fill-pipe restricter to allow only the smaller
unleaded nozzles to fit. Back when air was clean and sex was dirty, the leaded
nozzles were a lot bigger in diameter. In the early/mid 70's leaded gas was
still available and they did not want you to destroy the cat, so they put a
restricter in the neck. Now adays here in the USA, all you can buy is
unleaded, so you won't be able to put leaded fuel in. But most Calif smog
check inspecters go by the book. They have to inspect and make sure the
restricter is there....even though you can't buy leaded fuel. A lot of them,
however, don't check anymore. You take your chances.....
I did find a metal plate on a bus one day, the plate that goes on the outside
and is held on with 4 screws and the cap turns in it, that had a built-in
restricter. Neat piece, I grabbed it, but I have no idea where it went. It was
a VW part. I will have to look for it and see if it has a useful part number
on it.

&gt;
&gt; Karl has been filling me in on fuel lines, but I will post our last few
emails to the list, as it is very valuable info:
&gt;
&gt; Me:
&gt;
&gt; yes 76 bus, okay, the tube is metal right? I forgot. So just a few inches to
make the bend. But do you know the OEM size so I can try to match?
&gt;
&gt; what about the filler neck? I know busboys has the non-catalytic version
only (I have a cat) but whats the difference? Can I use their non-cat version
safely? Any other parts I need for a full fuel line replacement?
&gt;
&gt; Karl:
&gt;
&gt; &gt;What year bus?  If it is a 76-79, then you only need a special hose &gt;on the
tank end. It is about 4&quot; long but it has a bend in it.
&gt; &gt;NLA......
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Me:
&gt; &gt;&gt;about the gas filler hose. I believe it is 52 or 53mm, but that &gt;&gt;metric
size won't be easily found, so 2 1/4&quot; is the correct
&gt; &gt;&gt;american size right? Need about another meter/yard?
