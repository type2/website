Subject: engine bench stand use Q's

Hi everybody. I pulled the engine and tranny for the 69 Westy and I'm 
embarking on replacing the external oil cooler with a doghouse setup, new 
carb and clutch. I'm also going to reseal the pushrod tubes on one side 
(leaks) but my BIG question (for now) is... how does the engine mount on a 
benchtop engine stand?

I got one of those taiwan numbers from Bus Depot. It mounts on the workbench 
and there are two arms which come out, with a plate with a hole in each.

Which two of the four engine studs/bolts go into this? the tops? the 
bottoms? one top and one bottom on a side?

And I guess I need to find my own bolts/nuts for this?


ALSO: When I separated the engine and tranny, there was about two 
tablespoons of oil in the bottom of the tranny bellhousing. It looked like 
engine, not tranny oil.

There is caked oil all over the engine block under where the clutch is. So 
this, combined with the oil I found in the tranny should mean the main 
(flywheel?) seal needs replacing, right????



Thanks,

Jason
