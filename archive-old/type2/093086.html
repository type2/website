&gt;&lt;&lt; Anyone who doesn't have the money for a shop manual, doesn't have money

&gt;Easy now...If it's a choice between $26 for gas to get me to work and a
&gt;manual, well. Lotsa folks on this list bought a VW for all the reasons that
&gt;VW usta be famous for...Cheap, dependable wheels...

How can they be dependable wheels, when you don't have the basic knowledge
needed to properly maintain them?  It sounds to me like a case of running 
another
old VW into the ground through ignorance.

&gt;Lotsa folk on this list are tryin' to keep a 25+ year vehicle alive with a 
&gt;bicycle budget...

I thought that's what bicycles were for--those who can't even afford to keep an
old car maintained.  Just how long to you think it will stay alive, if you 
don't maintain it?

delusion.   R. Hunter
