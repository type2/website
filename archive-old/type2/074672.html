Subject: RE: camper conversion and rubber floor mats

Hi all,
  I am responding to two posts in one...
For the folks who have the Rivi with the broken
poptop... ever thought about switching to a Westy top?
 I have a spare I am just getting rid of, just haul it
away.  Canvas is bad... could be repaired though.  Off
a 1970... will work, but you will need to make new
mounting holes.
  
Rubber floor mats?  I have one out my 70... But I only
have the front and between the front seats.  If you
want them they are yours... just pay shipping or pick
them up.

I live in Ann Arbor Michigan and need to get rid of my
poor bus... I just want to see folks use as much of it
as possible.  I'd hate my bus to just go to waste.
