Hello All,
	Quite a while ago Bob Hoover posted a sermon detailing the
benefits of using TSP (trisodium phosphate) with boiling water to clean
parts. Well, today the opportunity arose that I needed to clean some
parts, so I strolled on down to my local hardware store and picked up some
TSP. I got it home and start boiling my parts (as per Hoover's
reccomendations) to discover that not much was going on. I grabbed the
&quot;TSP&quot; that I purchased, and started reading the label. I noticed right off
the stuff was labelled, TSP/90, and right above that, &quot;Phosphate Free.&quot;
How could tri-sodium phosphate be phosphate free? The answer is found when
you read the back, &quot;TSP/90 Heavy Duty Cleaner is a trisodium phosphate
substitute that neutralizes and floats away grease, grime, oil, and smoke
film.&quot; The active ingredient is Sodium Metasilicate.

Bob Hoover noted in his letter that some list members had tried &quot;TSP&quot;
without much success. My guess is that this is the reason.

How can they possibly be allowed to sell it under the name TSP at all? In
case you were wondering, the brand name is Red Devil, and it was purchased
at my local Ace Hardware.

Thanks for listening to my ramblings...
