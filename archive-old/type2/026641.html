Beth,

  I think you would have a better unit if you did away with the window-mounted &quot;air scoop&quot; (you can see traffic better too ;-)

  How about just rigging up a cooling unit (that you are already thinking of), and a recirculator fan set up?  This is what more modern cars (with built-in AC) do on the &quot;max AC&quot; position.
