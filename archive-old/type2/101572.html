Subject: EGR and driving

Well, I've been driving around with the EGR attached for about two weeks and
so far I can say that there's a big lag when starting from a stop because
the valve opens and all that exhaust floods in.  The vacuum gauge really
dips.

Performance isn't as good but not as bad as smog referee suggested: it would
run crappy.  I've also noticed that the engine seems to jerk a little when I
try to maintain speed with the pedal.  It was smooth without the EGR and now
it's just barely noticeable on rough roads but I can tell it's there.
