Subject: metal heat exchanger patches and spiders

Hello list,
Thanks for the tip not to use the fiberglass wrap.
Well, I was out side making patches to go in the heat
exchanger when I almost had a heart attack. I made
some paper patterns of what I wanted the metal patches
to look like. I them cut out a small piece of sheet
metal to work with using my air chisel. After that, I
casually slipped on my old leather work gloves and my
safety glasses so I could cut out the patches. Well,
as I was grinding away with my angle grinder, I felt
this tickling sensation running up my hand. I looked
down to find a brown recluse spider running out of my
glove and up the sleeve of my shirt. Needless to say,
I threw the angle grinder and commenced to dancing
around the back yard, yelling and stripping off my
clothes. I am now getting my wits together as I type
this. I will go back and finish up in a minuet. I am
sorry if I have wasted your time with my nervous
babbling. Have a great day! 

David Kelly
