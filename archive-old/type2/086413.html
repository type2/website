Subject: RE: [VB] Vac Dizzy Q

Hi,
I just did the same thing you are contemplating-same dizzy too, a 205T.

My changeover wennt really well, and I noticed an immediate difference.

I also rebuilt a 30 PICT2 carb, but it leaked, so I put back my *&amp;^#%*
Brosol until I can find another carb to rebuild.  Even with just changing
over the dizzy, the difference was very pronounced.  I have 5 busses/bugs,
all with 1600 engines, all with 009's.  You get used to the slight
hesitation, and in time, you get used to it.  I never realized what a
difference the 205T would make, or I would have done it long ago.

John Connelly at Oldvolks_dot_com REALLY know his stuff about Distributors, and
has been a great resource for solutions to problems.  You should log on to
his site, and he is great about answering questions.

Good luck, and let us all know how it turns out.

I'll be looking for another 30 PICT 2 or 3 at Pomona next time.

Ed

Subject: [VB] Vac Dizzy Q


Hi,

I have in my hand a VW 113-905-205T dizzy that came with my old 69
bus and it is the correct and original dizzy from that bus (1600 SP
non-doghouse.)  It gave 150,000 happy miles before it was forsaken
for a 009 during a roadside repair about a year ago. The bus would
occasionally hesitate as though it was not getting any spark for just
a second. That bus and motor are long gone but I still have the dizzy
and wonder if anything is really wrong with it.

The vac can seems good and the plate advances. There is no side to
side play in the shaft but there is a little up and down movement on
the shaft and I am not sure if that is normal.

I am determined to go back to a vacuum advance dizzy and wonder how
to tell if this one is really worn or not. I considered getting a
SVDA from aircooled_dot_net but the page says the dizzy they offer only
works with 34pict carbs and I have an H30/31 on my SP1600 doghouse
motor.

The 205T seems to be a pure vac advance dizzy and it would seem easy
to pull it apart and clean it up. Any thoughts or warnings on doing
this? Anyone know of a source for rebuilt vac advance distributors
that work with 30 series carbs? Anyone rebuild carbs?




Thanks
