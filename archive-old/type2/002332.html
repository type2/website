Thank the man, and then go buy it at Harbor Freight .

It's Friday (almost), fair's fair.  I've done it too, but exploiting a local
small guy for his display and helpfulness and then saving a couple of bucks
buying the same rig by catalog is dim busma.  And on a less lofty level, who
do you think is going to help with your questions when you're up and
running?  I say buy local and buy small when you can.  When you can't, it
can't get any easier than it is now.
