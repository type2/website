&gt; I  Try pulling off spark plug wires from the
&gt; distributor while the bus is running. You are VERY likely to find  one
&gt; plug wire that has no effect on the idle.... The problem is then
&gt; identified with that cylinder. Pull the plug and check the electrode...
&gt; If you have a known good plug on hand put that in its place. Try
&gt; swapping the injector leads with the other cylinder on that side. If
&gt; that doesn't work then pull the injector and check the spray pattern.




Thanks Greg. looks like Greg is right.  pulled the plug wires starting with
3, she died, 4, she died, 2, she died, 1, bumpbumpbumpBA, no change.  pulled
plug #1 and put in a new one.  no change.  switched plug wires around. no
change.  switched injector electircal leads.  no change.  guess the next
step is pull the injector(s) and check spray pattern.  funfun.  nothing
better than the hot sun, humid air and gasoline.  yeah.  maybe i'll smoke
and run torn electrical cords through water while i check the spray pattern.



Thanks everyone for your suggestions.
