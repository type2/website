Subject: Re: Aren't kids great?

&gt; Does anyone in the UK have a gas cap or an engine bay lock for a '73 bay
&gt; window they feel like selling?
&gt;
&gt; Is the gas cap supposed to be lockable?

Scratch that: I just bought a replacement lockable cap from the local
aircooled VW shop.  But I'd still be interested in an engine bay lock if
anyone has.

Cheers,

Chris.
