Ah, that's why I put in the key word:   most
Some Pick n Pulls have dealers licenses. Last time I asked, the one in
Merced didn't but the one in Fresno dies. Not sure about Stockton.
I'll see you Sat. morning and help you load that 21 window....

&gt; Actually, it can happen.  A very early T3 ghia was rescued from a
&gt; Pick-N-Pull earlier this year, thanks in part to VB lismember Tom Mink.
&gt;
&gt;&gt; you CANNOT buy a vehicle from most 'pick a part', 'pick your
&gt; &gt;&gt; part', or 'pick n pull' self-serve wrecking yards. They do not have a
&gt; &gt;&gt; dealers license. They only have a dismantlers license.
&gt; &gt;&gt; You can only buy parts that you can carry out thru the narrow front
gate.
