&lt;&lt;OK, now I have a dumb question.... I am still new to this great
adventure of Bus ownership. I just assumed my windshield washer pump was
bad, but hadn't checked yet. I noticed a funny little hose with what
appeared to be an air valve on it. Does the washer reservoir actually
use air pressure?!&gt;&gt; 

&lt;&lt;yep, however I can't remember the last time I've seen one of em work,
I have a new bottle since mine leaks like a sieve, if this doesn't work
I'm gonna put a aftermarket windshield washer pump on the dang thing 
Bob&gt;&gt;

     One thing I have not seen yet is you pump it up to 42 PSI. And mine
works great. Thanks for listening
