&gt; As most of us were taught in 8th grade English (but some have evidently 
&gt;  forgotten), the plural of &quot;bus&quot; is &quot;buses.&quot; It's one of those spelling 
&gt;  exceptions.

sorry, but this is bus related, sort of...
you have to be a little independent to be an owner/driver/mechanic of a 
vintage and sometimes cantanquerous (hehe) air-cooled.... much as like our 
american english has an independence from.....english.  We have a living 
language, it changes.  to me &quot;buses&quot; should be pronounced &quot;byoozez.&quot;   not 
&quot;busses.&quot;  I vote for &quot;busses.&quot;  no offense to our cousins over there, but 
I'm american, not english.  Anybody can spell anything anyway they want to at 
anytime they so desire,  okay? from now on?
