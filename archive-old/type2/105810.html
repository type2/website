&gt; I was ajusting the rear breaks today and found the adjusters still and

&gt; to adjust them again.

&gt; What is the proper grease,if any, to use in this location?

Since we don't want them to sieze up, anti-sieze grease seems to be the
logical choice.  It works for me, and the only time the adjusters come out
is when changing rear brake shoes.

Be really careful of the little springs that hold the stars in place.  If
you break them it's and adventure to fix!
