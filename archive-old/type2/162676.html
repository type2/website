&gt; &gt; Re the suggestion of a self-draining ice chest- I always thought it was
&gt; &gt; more efficient (longest cooling period) to let a cooler &quot;stew in its own
&gt; &gt; 32 deg F juices&quot; until all the ice had melted, as opposed to letting it
&gt; &gt; drain the constant melted water away- is that not true?  My common sense
&gt; &gt; thinking is by draining it, you are throwing away 32 deg water, much
&gt;
&gt; My take on it is that you are trying to keep the stuff inside the cooler
&gt; cold for as long as possible.  If you allow water to pool inside the
&gt; cooler you are creating a lower resistance heat path from the inner walls
&gt; of the cooler to the ice, causing the ice to melt faster.

hmm, I just run down the street to the icecream company and buy some dry
ice, wrap it in newspaper and it lasts forever, no mess either, or soggy
food, gotta pack carefully or your drinks (and other stuff) will freeze up
