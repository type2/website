Subject: Re: [T2] Color Question

&gt;&gt;&gt;What was the most popular/favorite color or color combination for the
&gt; transporter?

I'm painting my restored '73 Standard Bus Pastel White over Saturn 
Yellow...both '73 colors, but Saturn Yellow wasn't used on Buses to my 
knowledge. The bus was originally Pastel White over Kansan Red, but I wanted 
something that pops a bit more than that.

Peace,
