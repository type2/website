      Okay, I'm trying to figure out where one of the
 emissions hoses go.  
 This clear hose comes from the BOTTOM of the
 charcoal canister.  The same 
 type of clear (used to be anyway) vinyl hose comes
 from the top of the 
 charcoal canister to the air cleaner assembly.  This
 one goes from the 
 bottom of the canister to no-where!
 
     Where is it suppose to go?
