&gt;I got  a notice for the test, I have recently tuned the van, would an
&gt;emissions additive be recommended

No.

&gt; any other suggestions.  Rather not do
&gt;$450 worth of fixes to perfectly running bus, thanks!

New plugs, cap, rotor, etc, air filter, oil filter, oil change.

When was the last time you had the air fuel ratio adjusted?
