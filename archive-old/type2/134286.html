Subject: Re: [T2] Alternator Questions

From: &quot;Casting Fool&quot; &lt;jester_at_cfnson_dot_com&gt;
&gt; I'm afraid of hooking up the wire (thought about just connecting it to the
&gt; battery positive terminal just to see if it works) with it putting out 33
&gt; volts.  If this is just a symptom of not being hooked up and the voltage
&gt; will drop to a normal 14-15 volts, it should work fine.  I'm just not
&gt; knowledgeable enough to know what the correct thing is to do.
&gt; Should I just hook the wire up?

I got under the bus and attempted to trace the wires on the starter.  It
appears that only the heavy wire to the battery goes back into the engine
compartment.  The red wire with a white stripe, the smaller red wire, and
the heavier of the two wires on the spade connector go toward the front of
the bus.

There doesn't appear to be any other wire going from the starter back toward
the alternator.

My only concern about hooking the loose wire up to the starter is the
excessive voltage at idle (see above).

Does anyone out there know if the 33 volts from the loose wire will correct
itself when properly hooked up to the battery?  Can I temporarily hook the
wire directly to the positive battery terminal for now?
