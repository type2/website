Subject: Re: [T2] body/paint work Price

Brandt,

If it looks as good as you expect then it is worth any amount of money 
that you paid!

Lots of work ahead of you though...I am up to the point of finishing my 
headliner installation and starting to put side windows in yesterday and 
today.  What a job!!!!!!(the headliner that is!)

Cheers ,dave

&gt; Hello list,
&gt; 
&gt; I will get back my 78 Westfalia body on Friday. I have yet to see it 
&gt; painted, but can't wait.
&gt; 
&gt; I was wondering what other people have paid for body and paint work? My bill 
&gt; is just under $5k and a little below the estimate and far below other 
&gt; estimates. How does this compare?
&gt; 
&gt; I liked the guy who did the work and was pleased with the results I saw 
&gt; prior to painting. My bus (Vegas Bus) had no rust but some dents mainly in 
&gt; the nose (not replaced, but pulled and fixed) and a half dozen other minor 
&gt; dents. He also replaced the worn out lower sliding door track by cutting out 
&gt; the strip from above and replacing it with a heavier gauge of strip metal, 
&gt; which looks stronger than new. He painted the engine compartment plus a few 
&gt; select spots inside. I dropped off the bus in June as a body. No glass, no 
&gt; rubber, no gas tank, engine/trans, no pop-top, and no interior including 
&gt; dash. Just a body.
&gt; 
&gt; Anyway I'm just wondering what others have paid even though It won't change 
&gt; anything for me. Except maybe make me feel like I got a good or fair deal. I 
&gt; just hope I have not asked a question committing me to a lifetime doom, 
&gt; misery, and regret and that I have actually paid too much.
&gt; 
&gt; As always thanks,
&gt;
