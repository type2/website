Here's 2 more of my cents

&lt;&lt;Look. All I am is an bus enthusiast and small business owner, running
an honest business, trying to provide a good product to people at a good
price.&gt;&gt; I feel Ron is doing a hell of a job, I'm a cashier and make
mistakes all of the time, its impossible to please everyone all of the
time. All's what we can do is say I'm sorry, and move on. Sometimes it
takes a little more, and clearly Ron has shown he is doing what it's
taking, to try to fix things. If you have never made a mistake then you
are not human. I've made more than I can admit to at least I can say, I
know when I'm wrong. SO LETS MOVE ON.  

&lt;&lt;Many people on this list have been buying from me for years,&gt;&gt; And I
hope I can keep doing business with Ron for as long as I can.  
&lt;&lt;and probably could not have afforded to keep their bus were it not for
the money I've saved them and the quality parts I've provided.&gt;&gt; I know
I save money, at my wage I can't afford to waste money, going else
where. Example My local vw flaps charades $19.95 for a clutch cable, the
same one at Bus depot is $5.95 + S/H, I might have to wait longer
through bus depot but it is still cheaper. That way I'll order one
before I need it, so it's ready when I need it. OK I think I'm done
venting now.   
AND RON I HOPE YOU KEEP PROVIDING GREAT PARTS.

Thanks,
Shawn Reed
