&gt;I took a spare westy camp light I had and mounted it where the VW light

&gt;busses had a real nice bright lite there. Now I have it too. 3 bulbs are 
&gt;real nice.

I did the same to Casper, and it is great.
I need to find another light for NewBus so I can mount one up front for him.
Great improvement.
