Subject: '64 Splittie / '54 Bug

Hello again volks... I haven't been around here all summer, but I have a
couple of new projects which should keep me challenged this winter... and
beyond!

#1: An adorable '64 (I think) splittie has been given to me.  It comes with
plenty of problems though... lotsa rust, virtually no cargo floor (it's been
replaced with a sheet of steel), no engine, no _wheels_... and first/foremost
problem is how to get it out of the gully full of poison oak it's been
sitting in for long enough for pine trees to have grown up in the &quot;road&quot; it
was driven in on!  Can anyone identify the year for me from the ID number?
(Which is... ahem.... 24 12D522 - or the &quot;D&quot; could be an &quot;O&quot;.  This
is the number from the right side of the air duct.)

#2:  My SO called me today to announce that the '56 bug he's been adoring
from afar is now his and his alone! (for a price..&quot;monetary and
emotional&quot;...)   It's got a lot of surface rust, no rubber to speak of
anywhere, bent-in fender and a vandalized windshield, but is reasonably sound
otherwise.  Engine (out) has just been rebuilt, it needs brakes...  oh, etc.
etc.  After the initial shock, I got this silly, maudlin grin on my face...

Anyone have an idea what this bug is worth, in its present condition and/or
after full restoration?  We're told there are only -4- '56 Bugs in Calif.

Pointers to good manuals and how-to's on rust removal and body work would be
much appreciated here.

All rust aside, color me HAPPY!!!!   8)

Ruthie
'75 Westy... and '64? Splittie... and interest in a '54 Bug!
