&gt; I am purchasing a 1973 Devon Type 2. I have two children, one of which is 8 weeks old and in a large car seat. I cannot find any information regarding the fitment of seatbelts in rear of the vehicle and don't want to take the kids out until this has been rectified. I am looking to install three point belts rather than laptops.
&gt; 
&gt; Any help would be appreciated. This is my first message posted to the group, so please forgive me if this is already a well discussed topic.
Hi,
     I have a Devon camper, too (a '77).  There  are  seat  belt
mounting  points fitted to your van- I think they should be shown
in your owners manual, if you have one.
 There are two &quot;rows&quot; (minibuses had two rows of seats)  and  the
upper mounts are located
 
 (1) on the &quot;C&quot; pillars, immediately behind the sliding door, and
opposite.
 
 (2)  under  the  rearmost  side   windows,   just   behind   the
sink/fridge, and opposite.
 
 The lower mounts for the forward row are in the floor. They  are
concealed  by  the  flooring  that  Devon  fitted  to  cover  the
sheetmetal floor.
 
 The lower mounts for the rearward row are under the  rear  seat-
the  centre ones are easy to see (two pairs) but the outboard ones
are hidden: The offside one is right at the bottom of  the  narrow
gap between the underseat box and the offside bodywork. The inner
one is buried beneath your fridge/sink unit.
 
 The factory setup was to have a couple of three-point belts and
the rest lap-belts, if I recall correctly. You can buy belts from
parts places (Halfords may carry them?).
 
 I have two three-point belts fitted.  One  is  anchored  to  the
correct  three points on the offside of the car, the other to the
correct upper mount but to the centre pair of underseat locations
that  would normally be used for a central lap belt. I don't know
whether this is better or worse  than  just  having  a  lap  belt
there. The fridge/sink occupies the space where the passenger for
the nearside three-point belt is supposed to sit.
 
 It's a tricky tradeoff between safety and interfering  with  the
practicality of the vehicle. At the moment the back seats in mine
are only used occasionally, and by adults. Other possibilities
that I have considered are:
 
 Fit a &quot;Harness bar&quot; between the rearward upper mounting points.
        -This would get the positioning better at the cost of
         convenience. I seem to remember seeing this sort of
         arrangement but don't know if the bar is bolted in or
         has a release mechanism to allow use of the bed.
 
 Fit VW minibus middle seat and corresponding belts.
        -a pain if you want to camp, no head retraints. Lap belts(?)
 
 Fit aftermarket seats with integral belts to factory VW floor
locations.
        -ditto re camping, and the floor fittings may not be
         rated for this use.
 
 You might try to find someone who fits racing harnesses to older
cars (eg historic rallying)- they might be able to suggest an
arrangement that was safe and convenient?

Good luck!
Cheers,
               W.
