Subject: Re: [T2] Parts ordering experience w/ 4 vendors

&gt;&gt;&gt;Bus Depot: **

I have to concurr - I used to be very happy with Busdepot, but the last
couple of times I needed parts, the guy taking the order did not know
anything beyond the catalogue which IMHO is not too helpful, anyway. Getting
the right items on time has not been an issue for me, but getting parts for
which I did not have the part number and that did not show in the catalogue
has proven to be next to impossible. It is a shame - especially with the new
website and the huge database - however, most of that stuff is really
inaccessible to the guy taking the orders.
