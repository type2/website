Subject: Re: Fuel Filler Necks are Back!

You cannot put a flap in the bus filler neck. The unleaded neck is molded
with a smaller hole.
The flap was NOT there to keep fumes in the car. It was there to keep idiots
from putting leaded gas in an unleaded-only vehicle.
Starting in '74 all cars sold in California as of model year 75 were
required to use unleaded fuel, which used a pump nozzle that was smaller in
diameter. Leaded fuel was still available but the nozzle was standard size.
The restricter made the hole smaller so you could only put unleaded in the
tank.

&gt; &gt; But go westy's are for leaded fuel nozzles. Here in California you
cannot
&gt; &gt; pass the Smog Check visual if you don't have a fillpipe restricter for
&gt; &gt; unleaded nozzles. Yes, I know that all you can buy is unleaded but I
guess
&gt; &gt; the state of California doesn't.....
&gt;
&gt; The fillpipe restrictor on a lot of cars had a little flap in it to keep
the
&gt; gas fumes inside the car. This also explains the bellows on the gas pump
&gt; nozzles.

And the bellows is part of the vapor recovery system.... supposed to keep
you from breathing the fumes while you are pumping gas.
