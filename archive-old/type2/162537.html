&gt; &gt;what have a broken????   how do you fry a magnet??
&gt;
&gt; The cobalt magnets in the Pertronix sleeve are only the trigger for the hall sensor in the module.

thats what I thought

&gt; Check the dwell/timing as you crank the engine (remote starter or friend helping) to see if it's kaput.

hard to check if it won't start, but getting no trigger from pertronix
that I can tell.  not sure how to check module

thanks
