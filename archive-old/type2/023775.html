Hi volks,

&gt; My opinion on this subject is that the factory is well aware that buses
run 
&gt; hot.  They run so hot that they often fail catastrophically because of it.

 I disagree. If catastrophic engine failure happened &quot;often&quot; VW would not
have a reputation for reliability and longevity.

&gt; They didn't put gauges in busses or even offer them as an option because
they 
&gt; didn't want there customers to know how hot their engines were getting.

 I disagree. The VW bus is a utility vehicle and gauges were and are an 
unnecessary expense.

&gt; I think the reason I can get 140,000 miles on an engine is that when I
build 
&gt; it I pay attention to detail as Dr. Tim recommends.

 Yup. I'm with you here. Build it right, maintain it right and it won't
overheat.

 IMHO gauges are an accessory for driver satisfaction. They are not
essential
for correct operation of a stock engine.

 Out of interest, is there anyone here who can say they were able to prevent
damage to a stock engine, through the use of gauges, which would have
happened
otherwise? ie not &quot;I heard it pinking and noticed the oil pressure was low&quot;
or &quot;I smelt hot oil and saw the CHT was rising&quot; but &quot;everything was going
perfectly and then the oil pressure started to drop. I pulled over and 
found that my engine was about to explode with no other indication!&quot;.

Cheers,
	W.
