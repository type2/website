Subject: Geostar Tires ?

    I stopprd by the local tire place yesterday and told the young
fella behind the counter that I was looking for a 185R14 light truck
tire with reinforced side walls and load range of C or higher.  Of
course he insisted that I was leaving out a middle number like 65 or
70 but I just asked him to see what he could find for me.
    Last night he called me back with info.  He said he could get a
tire like I was looking for made by Geostar.  It is a light truck tire
with an 8 ply rating and load range D.
    Anyone have any experience with these tires, good or bad, that
they would be willing to share?????
