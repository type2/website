Hi volks,

&gt;Lately, there has been some misinformation and guesswork posted to the list
&gt; regarding tires for 1968-1979 Type 2 busses.

 Whaddaya mean lately? We've been posting misinformation and guesswork about tyres for years!

&gt; Here are the specifications for the original equipment radial tires (earlier
&gt; buses had bias ply OE tires):**

 Err, from where did these specs come, out of interest?

 Sean Bartnik's scanned '78 owners manual (http://www.type2_dot_com/bartnik/tech.htm) lists acceptable tyres as:

 185R14C 6PR Load range C
 185SR14 Reinforced

 and indicates that you shouldn't mix these specs on the same axle. It explicitly indicates that these are European standards (C indicates European commercial vehicle load range C and reinforced indicates a strengthened passanger car tyre in the European system of rating).

 My European '77 kombi manual (for a camper) has the European specs for the various models of type2 of that year. It makes no reference to Reinforced tyres but recommends 185R14C 6PR tyres for L model busses, ambulances and firetrucks and 7.00 14 8PR for delivery vans (I presume these are crossplies!).
 
 The Haynes manual for pancake type-2s says 185SR14 Reinforced tyres are OK on '72-on Campmobiles but others should use 185R14C commercial vehicle tyres.
 Radials were fitted from '71-on (and if you do fit crossplies they need to be 8-ply-rated).

 The conclusion I draw from this is that a reinforced passanger car tyre is marginal for use on a type2,  unreinforced tyres are wholly inappropriate  and that a European commercial vehicle spec. load range &quot;C&quot; tyre is a sensible miminum fitting for acceptable handling on modern roads.
 My experience, and reading of the list, indicates that load range &quot;D&quot; tyres are stiffer (=better handling) and wear better than load range &quot;C&quot;s. They probably don't warrant the extra cost in purely commercial terms (and are technically overspecified) but some individuals think the extra cost is worth it. Much in the same way as many drivers of sporty saloons feel that it's worth spending money on top of the line performance tyres, even though they are overspec, as they may improve handling and roadholding.

 In this context this tyre:

&gt;            LOAD   OUTSIDE   SECTION    RIM       REVS
&gt;   SIZE     RANGE  DIAMETER   WIDTH    WIDTH    PER MILE    MAXIMUM LOAD
&gt; --------   -----  --------  -------  --------  --------  ----------------
&gt; 185R14RF*   SL     25.6&quot;     7.4&quot;    4.5-6.0&quot;    816     1477 lbs _at_42 psi
&gt; 
&gt;   NOTE: This is not a load range C or D tire, this is a reinforced
&gt;         standard load tire which allows for higher inflation pressures
&gt;         and therefore higher maximum loads.  

 Looks adequate but (IMHO) marginal for modern road conditions or a laden vehicle.

Whereas these Dunlops:

&gt; In contrast, Dunlop offers a couple of load range C and D tires in this same
&gt; size:
&gt; 
&gt;         LOAD   OUTSIDE   SECTION    RIM       REVS
&gt;   SIZE  RANGE  DIAMETER   WIDTH    WIDTH    PER MILE    MAXIMUM LOAD
&gt; ------  -----  --------  -------  --------  --------  ---------------
&gt; 185R14    C     25.7&quot;     7.4&quot;    4.5-6.0&quot;    811     1600 lbs _at_ 50 psi
&gt; 185R14    D     25.7&quot;     7.4&quot;    4.5-6.0&quot;    811     1855 lbs _at_ 50 psi

 Look ideal, with the choice being dependent on the buyer's wallet and personal preferences.

&gt; I hope that this helps clear things up a little bit and make it a little easier
&gt; to buy new tires.

 Ditto.

&gt; Is anyone interested in my creating a web page covering this and other issues
&gt; regarding bus tires?

 Sounds good to me- It's been tried before (there has been a tyre FAQ around before) but the specific recommendations have dated. I personally think it would be worth putting a shortcut to a tyre information summary, preferably with recommendations for specific tyres available in the US,  down the left hand side of the type-2 webpage along with the library/archive/bartnotek/events buttons!!!

Cheers,
               W.
