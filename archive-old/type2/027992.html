A guy I've been communicating with is selling a bus with a VIN number: 2212271111. If memory serves me, this is '71--his title and dash VINs match; I told him to check the one in the engine compartment, but he hasn't gotten back to me on that. 

HOWEVER!!!, the picture doesn't even remotely resemble a '71. MANY too many differences. See what you think:

I'm guessing '77 because of the high seats and the sink vent on the driver's side. Ideas appreciated.

Thanks! Joe
