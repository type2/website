Subject: [T2] Fuel Filler Neck FS

Yep.

I bought two fuel filler necks from Australia.  I don't need either, but I 
wanted one for reserve.

My Master Card says I paid total $59.74 (which included shiping).

Anyone local who wants to share one??  $29.87 if my math is correct.  Both 
you and I willl have saved half the shiping cost.
