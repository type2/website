Hi Sean,

I think this all comes down to &quot;Acceptable Risk Management&quot;. There are a
couple of people I know who wouldn't dream of operating any vehicle on the
highway, period. They own cars with built-in crumple-zones and air-bags, but
they're scared stupid just the same. Or perhaps they simply know their
limitations. These same people smoke cigarettes that they KNOW will
eventually reduce the quality of their lives or could potentially end them.

Up here in the Great White North there is a REAL danger to one's health
posed by the weather conditions these heaters were designed to combat.
Getting stuck at the side of the road in the dead of winter can kill you
every bit as dead as a leaky rubber fuel line. You have to look after your
gear. If you can't do that, you shouldn't install one. Period. In fact, IMHO
if you can't look after your gear you should seriously investigate public
transit. ;^)

I've had 3 VW's in the family with gas heaters, and one of these had a
beetle-heater craftily installed on the floor at the passengers seat. That
one was over 20 years ago, and I wouldn't do it again, it got in the way. It
did work really well though, with lots of hot air up front where it was
needed.

Don't like rubber lines? Run copper or steel. Keep a fire extinguisher
handy, and RELIGIOUSLY GIVE THE HEATER REGULAR MAINTENANCE. Do that and
it'll be at least as safe as the under-bus propane bottle that prohibits
most westy's from underground parking lots.

That's my $.02, YMMV.


Happy trails,

&gt;&gt; Running fuel lines in the passenger compartment is a big No-no, much less
&gt;&gt; burning it there.
&gt; 
&gt; I think you said this much too delicately.
&gt; 
&gt; Let me say it a little more forcefully because it's important:
&gt; 
&gt; Running fuel lines in the passenger compartment is STUPID.
&gt; Installing a gasoline-burning heater in the passenger compartment is
&gt; likewise STUPID.
&gt; 
&gt; Nothing like incinerating your family.  That's gotta make you feel good.
&gt; 
&gt; The Eberspacher gas heaters are well-designed and safe.  But I sure as hell
&gt; wouldn't put one in the passenger compartment.  Call me paranoid if you
&gt; want, but you are supposed to be paranoid with gasoline because burn wards
&gt; are scary and excruciatingly painful places.
