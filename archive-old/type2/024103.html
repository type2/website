&gt; I must point out that these devices are intended to provide for hammering
&gt;  the nut loose. In such case you are using your bearings for an anvil. It
&gt;  was not considered in the design criteria for those bearings to be
&gt;  subjected to half ton hammering loads. If that won't turn a stress riser
&gt;  into a crack, nothing will.

Hmmmm... I'd say that the presence of a 1/2&quot; square hole in the proper 
location militates against their being &quot;designed for hammering&quot;:-), though 
I'm sure that some folks do it this way.

I'd also guess that the load is around half a million lbs per square in. Not 
&quot;my&quot; bearings :-) At the bery least, they will be flase Brinelled and fail 
very soon in service.

Good advice not to do it that way.
