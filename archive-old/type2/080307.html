&gt;What is that mayonnaise? I never saw that in my 75 (1800) but the 76 I have
&gt;now with the
&gt;2 ltr always has that gunk on the inside of my oil cap?

A colloidial suspension of oil and water ( they don't mix well ) frothed
by the reciprocating ( eggbeater ) activity which occurs inside your engine.
