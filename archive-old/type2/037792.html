Either Paul knows something I don't (entirely
probable;-), or the '68 has a different front beam
than an early '69 (not-so probable)....

I looked into converting my '69 to front disks and
took it to my VW Guru friend for advice.

He told me that sometime in '69, they switched the
bolt-pattern (the bolts that hold the beam to the
body, not lug-studs), and that the later ones fit, but
not the early. We checked mine and....no go. In order
to make the change to disks, I'd have to swap-out the
shafts themselves and have the master-cylinder bracket
welded onto my existing beam. This was more work (and
money) than I was interested in at the time, so I
opted out.

The bolts in question are located inside the
wheel-wells on either side and they hold the beam to
the body. There are 2 on either side. You can measure
the distance between the bolts (or holes) and see if
they will swap, but measure carefully, as I remember
the diference is less than an inch.


And yes, there are a few one-year only parts on the
'68 (doors, door handles and locks are the only ones
that I know of for sure, but I think there are some
others), but nothing that would stop me from buying a
Double Cab!!! DC's are *way* cool, and I would love to
have one! I'm jealous!
