&gt; have a 74 with an automatic transmission.  I am running a 2L with FI and
&gt; want to put in a 79 automatic transmission.  Has anyone done this
&gt; conversion?

it has been done and it is not all that difficult, but be aware it is NOT
a drop fit.

&gt; Also does anyone have a good automatic tranny 74-76?

the 74-75 tranny is different than the 76-79
the early ones had a vacuum shifter the later ones have a govenor shifter

&gt; I am located in MD

I'm in Baltimore, where are you??
