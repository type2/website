Subject: 76 Westy wiring for trailer??

Hello Everyone,

I have just purchased a trailer and hitch for my 1976 VW westy. I need to 
wire the van for the trailer lights now. Anyone ever do this? Where are the 
connections? Any special adapters needed? Also if someone has a wiring 
diagram I would love to get a copy.

Cheers,

Matt
