Message-ID: &lt;3703746034.3 tuning &amp; CO2 visions*_at_m400gw.wiley_dot_com&gt;

About 20 minutes into my adjusting of the carb I stop and realize that the 
mixture screw might not be seating after all. I pull it out and discover that 
I used the wrong screw gasket from the kit, this one is too big. So digging 
up a used one, I replace it and find the screw goes alot farther into the 
carb. A big Doh! from me for bad mouthing the carb prematurely. After another 
hour of field tuning, sucking in all that good hot exhaust, the 34.3 started 
talking like Mr. Plummer in that commercial. It says &quot;Less turning of 
adjusting screws and more test driving!!!!&quot; so I complied (I kept the window 
open hoping for some oxygen) and wouldn't you know the 'dead spot' has been 
upgraded to 'slight hesitation' which, although I don't like the carb, I must 
admit it now reigns supreme as a shining example of German engineering, and 
will proceed to bite my tongue before bashing it, and keep working on the 
slight hesitation problem, which  is perhaps correctable or perhaps not, 
depending on carb wear and the ability of the owner to concentrate and focus 
in the midst of talking carbs and dirty looks from neighbors.
