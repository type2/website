Subject: [T2] Type 4 Engine Thermostats

List members,

as many of you have found out (the hard way), the Type 4 engine thermostats
are impossible to get (the company making them stopped). Well, it turns out
that you can use type 1 thermostats with a little work (not much; any 6th
grader can do it). We have instructions on how on our site as of tomorrow,
and hopefully this will result in a few orders for thermostats. :-)

Remember, 10% off for T-2 listmembers if the order is over $50.

&gt; Volks,
&gt;
&gt; I should probably be saving these for a whatzit, but someone out there
&gt; needs them, so I am posting instead.  Someone asked Nikki to look for the
&gt; rollers that hold the engine hatch in the raised position.  The ones that
&gt; travel in that wire loop on the right side of the hatch.  Well, Nikki and
&gt; I found some last time I was in CA, then I put the $#$^ things in my
&gt; pocket and brought them back here to VA.  I don't know who it was, but
&gt; could you please get in touch with me and I will mail them out?
