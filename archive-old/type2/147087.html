Subject: Re: [T2] Heater... too much of a good thing!

I too encountered the rusty guide tube problem- one old cable would not 
pull out.  Daughter's bus gets 50% heat on one cable- to get 50% to 100% 
one would lie underneath and wire open the flapper box- a messy choice- 
many do this just for winter.  . I rigged a wire from the flapper box 
arm to a small eyebolt mounted onto the triangle welded by the rear 
wheel jack mount.  The wire has a pull knob on the end- now she need 
only pull on the wire and lock it by twisting it over itself.

&gt; as far as turning the heat on and off, that can be a royal pain in the 
&gt; ass.  A couple months ago I put new cables in and it was sure tough. 
&gt; Turns out that the old cables rusted themselves in and I had to cut out 
&gt; the old guide pipes and I run new copper tubing to the back.  It was NOT 
&gt; a fun job and I would never wish it on anyone else.
