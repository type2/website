Subject: Re: [T2] Should caliper bleed screw leak?

Oh, then I'll go ahead and write the email I was going to write... don't 
worry about it.  You're still accomplishing the end task of getting the 
bubbles out and/or flushing the old fluid.  Now if it leaks when the 
valve's closed, you have a problem.

Now... if you're trying to make this a spotless job, then you have a 
problem..

But then again, when has working on a bus been spotless.. HA!
