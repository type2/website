Subject: Re: Oil temp sender in sump plate (was &quot;Snake oil or real
  product&quot;)

I have not used the stock oil strainer in any of my high
&gt; &gt; performance street or race engines since 1966. I found that it often 
&gt;caused
&gt; &gt; too much restriction on the suction side of the oil pump with a little
&gt; &gt; higher performance and high RPM engines.
&gt;
&gt;Note the &quot;higher performance and high RPM&quot; bit.  He isn't talking about
&gt;stock bus engines here.
&gt;
Neither am I. I assume a good chunk of the list has something that would 
qualify their engines as &quot;a little high performance.&quot;


&gt;Gene Berg has some good ideas, but he isn't infallable.

Agreed.


&gt;
I'd rather pull an engine apart to fix
&gt;the broken piston skirt or whatever and not have to replace the oil pump
&gt;and possibly bearings if bits of metal managed to bypass the oil filter
&gt;when the engine is cold.


True. But a rare occurence, I would think (the piston skirt breaking).



&gt;There are very few parts on a bus that are without value.  Kettering's law
&gt;was observed more by VW than by any other manufacturer.

Again I agree. I was amazed at how much better my engine ran in the winter 
when I plumbed hot air to the air cleaner, as VW did. But while VW may have 
had a reason for installing what they did, I don't think everything is 
necessary. I wouldn't remove the thermostat, for example, but I have no 
qualms with ditching the throttle positioner and tuning the engine to run 
without it. VW engineering is bone-simple. It can, and has been, improved 
upon many times by many people. It took VW years to bring out the doghouse 
cooler and by that time, some owners had begun auxilliary cooling on their 
own. So there's no reason to believe VW was perfect.

Philosophy does account for much of it. I don't expect to break a piston 
skirt before I rebuild this engine, or run it out of oil and gall the 
bearings ... but I *could,* and if I did I might have to replace the oil 
pump because I had no screen ... but then I would most likely replace the 
oil pump anyway, so it doesn't matter to me.

I might give that oil-pressure relief sender a try on the next engine, 
though. This mounts in one of the plunger holes under the engine? Sounds 
better than the sump plate model, which inevitable picks up a lot of oil.

Good discussion, for certain.

I have to have
&gt;solid instrumented evidence that leaving a part off is advantageous before
&gt;I would risk doing so.
