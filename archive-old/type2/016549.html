I never managed to stop the oil leaks on my '79 van, however, a recurring
problem was the pushrod tube o-rings.  The o-rings on the cylinder head
end of the push rod tube (a) may be subject to high head temps and (b)
are very near the exhaust manifold.  I continued to have leakage in this
area even after replacing the o-rings.  I suspect that the o-ring material
was failing due to the high heat.  Someone, i believe Jim Thompson at
oldvolkshome, sells o-rings made of ?viton? that will stand up to the heat. 
I would recommend checking this out.  The symptom of my leaking
pushrod tube seals was heater boxes full of oil.  Michael Ibey of Enfield,
NH once told me that the problem of leaking push rod seals on the Type IV
can be solved by applying a bead of high temp silicone (permatex red)
around the area where the push rod tube exits the cylinder head.  I never
tried this solution, so I can't comment on its effectiveness.
