Subject: Re: [T2] how do I install door seals??

Hi. 
You know, I bought, like 5 $20 window seals from
Busdepot. They ARE gonna seal, right? Is it the same
thing with window seals, too? Now I'm paranoid.

&gt; If the front door seals didn't cost $100 each (or

&gt; razor before I could 
&gt; shut the door without it bouncing open again. And it
&gt; still takes a firm 
&gt; hand to seal the door properly.
