Subject: VW Adventure: My engine fell out! (long)

Two days ago, I had my first major &quot;adventure&quot; with the '71 Westy that I
bought a month ago.  I was driving up to Lake Tahoe from the San Francisco
Bay Area to do a little bit of rock climbing with a friend.  After battling
the wonderful bay area rush our traffic and serious winds that knocked my
poor bus all over the road, we finally made it to the base of the Sierras
and began the grueling climb up to Tahoe.  I knew that something wasn't
exactly right with my bus because it was leaking oil much more than it did
when I bought it (I was putting in nearly a quart of oil every second time
we stopped for gas!), and it was smoking pretty bad when we were climbing
the hills... the whole engine compartment was slick with oil.  But we
figured that we would just have to deal with it when we got back to the bay
area - an oil leak is not the end of the world and we decided to just live
with it for the time being.

We made it past Placerville and then about 15 miles further along the
highway, as I was downshifting into third to try and keep climbing, we heard
this god awful crash and a terrible grinding sound.  The gear shift jumped
out of my hand, and in my rearview mirror I could see sparks flying!  My
partner snapped out of the half-asleep state that he had been sinking into
and we freaked out.  I quickly hit the brakes and pulled over to the side of
the highway thinking that I had left my entire transmission or worse lying
on the highway a couple hundred feet behind us.  We got out to inspect the
damage, and found the engine hanging out of the bottom of the bus resting on
the engine mount which had completely sheared off!!  Not really knowing a
lot about VW's yet (or cars for that matter), it looked about as bad as it
can get and I was devastated... I had just saved up enough money and had
taken this quarter off from my final year of college to spend 5 months in
Yosemite living in my bus and rock climbing.  My first thoughts were, &quot;this
is going to cost a fortune to fix and there's no way I can go climbing
now... I'm going to have to get a job to pay for this!&quot;

And of course, as luck would have it, my printer wasn't working the day we
left, so I was unable to print out the AIRS list.  So we got on my cellphone
(which miraculously had pretty good reception), and called up AAA.  After
getting transferred around between different operators, they finally told me
that they would get someone out to help us out.  So we sat by the bus in the
frigid 25 degree weather for nearly an hour waiting for the flatbed tow
truck to come to our rescue (it had already been out on another call when we
called in).  The local rookie sheriffs pulled over and gave us a really hard
time and were complete jackasses - they didn't offer to help in anyway at
all, and basically just laughed at our situation and told us that our &quot;piece
of crap&quot; car was to blame for all of our problems (even though the bus is in
otherwise incredible condition).

Anyway, so an hour later, the tow truck arrived and to our great fortune,
the driver was an ex VW mechanic whose father was also a VW mechanic - this
man really really knew his stuff.  After assessing the situation, he
declared that it actually was nowhere near as bad as we had originally
thought.  It looked like the engine itself had not actually ever touched the
ground and that it had been held off of the ground by the engine mount.  The
transmission looked ok (but obviously we wouldn't know for sure until it got
checked out at a garage), and that unless there was internal damage that we
couldn't see from the outside, this was actually going to be relatively easy
and inexpensive to fix!  I can't even begin to describe how happy I was to
hear this from someone who actually knew what he was talking about.  Anyway,
so we loaded the bus up onto the truck and climbed in and then tried to
decide what to do.  As a AAA Plus member, I had 100 miles of free towing,
but to get back to the bay area was going to be about 180.  I finally
decided that it was worth the $250 it would cost me to have the bus being
worked on by people I know, and close enough to my house that I can go over
and check it out periodically.

Three or four hours later (around 3am at this point), after having a great
time telling stories about VWs, asshole cops, and the crazy scenes that our
driver had been called to for towing jobs, we finally arrived at Fred's
Garage of Redwood City.  Not really knowing what to do, we simply unloaded
the bus by the curb right outside their lot.  The next morning, I returned
to the lot to talk with a mechanic and get a quote on the repairs.  After
surveying the damage, we decided to do the following work:
1) Install a new engine mount and cradle, etc. and reinstall the engine
2) Install a new muffler (since the old one had already died in the past)
3) Check out the oil cooler to try and track down the oil leak problem
4) Do a general check of everything underneath bus since I haven't had it
checked out since I bought it a month ago

Estimated price for all of that work: $310!!  I was shocked.  Who would
believe that I could have all of that work done for (hopefully) only $310
parts and labor?!  They even told me they would have it done by early next
week (I talked to them on Friday!)

So all in all, I ended up with a great story to tell people, a bus that will
hopefully run better than it did before the whole affair, and I now know a
very reputable mechanic that I will going to for everything I can't do
myself (I know lots of people that swear by this guy and won't take their
VWs anywhere else), and hopefully it won't cost me more than $600... which
isn't great, but it won't break my bank account and I might still be able to
keep my plans for climbing this summer in Yosemite.
