ok...hear me out
you all know of my electrical problem with starting and installing a
switch...right? of course...
anyways...the 5th fuse in from the right on my 71 bus constantly keeps
getting blown.  my interior light (front one on headliner) and my
emergency flashers don't work when this is blown.  I followed the wire
&gt;from the fuse (in a wiring diagram) and it also goes to the solenoid on
the starter.  Could this be my starting problem???  what size fuse
should be in there?  I currently have an 8 in there because thats what
was in there before...
help?

thanks!
