My jury is in &amp; the isolator is out
Data:
Alternator charging v - 13.7 volts
w/ the isolator - voltage at batteries: 12.5 volts
Voltage drop due to diodes in isolator: (13.7-12.5=) 1.2 volts !!!!!!
ughhhhh!!
Then (very important) sliced a wire to the alt charging light/heater
blower fan wire (the blue one coming from the voltage regulator) to
control the action of the relay.  This way the two batteries are only
connected when the alternator is creating electricity (very important if
you have a discarged camping batt)

And I am very happy w/ the relay - don't do the isolator!

Michael, I'm glad the relay worked well for you.  I like the clever way you
rigged it to the alternator.  But, please see my earlier post about the need
to modify the alternator so that the batteries will receive the full
charging voltage.  Simply connecting a standard isolator to a Bosche
alternator will result in low voltage output and the poor battery charging
conditions you were experiencing.  With the proper isolator and the simple
alternator modification, an isolator should work just as well, and (no
flames or FARTs please) perhaps better under certain conditions such as when
there is a large voltage difference between the two batteries.
