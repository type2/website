Subject: Oil around the engine temp sensor!!??

Well problems are never ending with my machine! It's great study but I
don't have time for it right now.

I replaced the electronic ignition and coil last week and thought it was
running beautifully.  Today however, it suddenly wouldn't start (much
like before my replacement work). I checked the coil, electronic
ignition, distributor etc. and couldn't figure out what was wrong. It
turned over no problem but didn't sound like it was firing, even though
there was a spark coming from the coil.

Then, to my dismay, when I was looking at the distributor, I noticed
that the temp sensor right behind the distributor (meaning toward the
front of the vehicle) was in a pool of oil!!!! Oh My God! was the first
thing to come out of my mouth.

When I was replacing the previously mentioned parts, I had noticed some
debris and a little oil residue around the temp sensor and though
nothing of it (probably a mistake) but this was a pool!! I soaked it all
up with a rag, disconnected the temp sensor wire and cleaned it (also
taped up an uncovered portion??) and the bus fired right up.

What gives?? The only thing that I can think of is that I drove
approximately 60 miles or so yesterday which is further than I usually
drive, with a load in the bus a made an existent problem worse??

I listened to all the Engine sounds from the Type II Library and now
realize that my valves are loose and have been for quite some time.
(Sound from my bus is especially noticable on the left side of the
engine - same side as the temp sensor) Any connection??  I'm afraid so,
but I don't know much about the nitty gritty of a VW engine. I'm
learning but probably the hard way!!

Any help will again and as always be appreciated.

P.S. By the time I finish up the MA degree that I'm currently working
on, I will also be close to being able to fix just about anything on a
VW. (or at least it's starting to feel that way!!)
