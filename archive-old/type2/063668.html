WOOPS!  Dangerous misunderstanding due to incomplete 
information supplied by myself!!

The article I referred to, and my own pop-top cleaning, involve 
cleaning the top WHEN IT IS OFF THE VEHICLE and WITH 
THE CANVAS REMOVED.  This would be in preparation to 
replace the canvas.  Silly me--I was somehow certain this was what 
you wanted to do--since this is what I am about to do.

Using X-14, or any other chlorine-containing cleaner would make a 
real mess of the canvas, and possibly the vehicle paint as well.  : (

All list members should be careful to NEVER try any of this at home, 
and furthermore, not to place much confidence in the opinions of a 
medium sized dog--even if he CAN type. : &gt;)

.....be on the road in no time.
