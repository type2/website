X-Diagnostic: MESSAGE MAY NOT BE TOPICAL - S


 This bus already has the hot start
&gt; solution installed. So, is
&gt; the click the relay closing or something else? Is
&gt; the starter solenoid bad?
&gt; 
&gt; To my great suprise (after a lengthy tow)I learned
recently that the hot start solution has its own fuze.
 Check that out for a potential remedy.
&gt;
