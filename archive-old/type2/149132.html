I have a '76 that has had the FI replaced with a carb.

What you are describing sounds like what I have.  It is probably a Weber
progressive DFAV/DGAV or DFEV/DGEV.

If it is electric choke, it is the &quot;EV&quot;.

Also, where is the fuel line and the air adjustment screw?  If it to the
front of the bus (a real pain to get and *$%&amp; to adjust) it is like mine
and the &quot;DF&quot; series.

I am a newbie to all of this but I think what I mention here is correct.

Hope this helps,

I know, a dumb question, but ...

This morning  I decided I'd had enough of stalling, hesitation, etc
and it was time to get rid of the mechanical distributor and replace
it with an SVDA.

I get to the order screen at aircooled_dot_net, and I need to know my
Carb to order the right one.

I know its a Webber, center mount, fitted by the PO. (The engine is
a 74, originally california).

Its got a big rectangular air cleaner on top, a vacuum line on the
back (of the bus), and the linkage on the right (of the bus).

I cant find any other identification on it.

Is this enough information to identify it without a picture?
If not, where do I look for identifying marks?

kevin.
