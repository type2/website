&gt;===== Original Message From &lt;catheyd_at_epud_dot_net&gt; =====
&gt;Hello,
&gt;	This is a serious and timely question to put on this list, especially when
&gt;gas prices are skyrocketing as they are these days.  Is there anyone out
&gt;there who has had experience with a T2 that has been converted to run on
&gt;propane or other natural gas?  What does the conversion entail?  Is the
&gt;mileage better or worse?  Is it very cost prohibitive to make the
&gt;conversion?  Any warnings or cautions I should be aware of?  I was just
&gt;thinking that since propane in Oregon seems to be about $1.05 instead of
&gt;$1.60 a gallon, this might be something to consider in the long run.
&gt;	Or, and this might be pushing it, how about a hybrid (gas, electric), pure
&gt;electric, or fuel cell set up?  Any thoughts?  What ever happened to that
&gt;holy-grail of a 100 MPG carbeurator I heard about years ago?
&gt;
&gt;Thanks,
&gt;

In the latest edition of the Muir book, they have a chapter on conversion to 
Propane.  They say no the CNG because the trade of in gallons of fuel to 
weight is not worth it.  There was no info on electric or hybrid.  As I recall 
the Muir book referred you to company in TEXAS for the how to.  If you want 
the info, let me know and I'll look it up for you.
