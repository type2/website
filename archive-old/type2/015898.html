&gt;I can't speak to Woosung tyres, but three or four years ago I bought a set of

I've actually heard of Kumho tires - some friends of mine run them on their
Mustangs.  Specifically, they make a race compound tire that is similar to
a BFG Comp TA R-1.  I would not hesitate to buy a Kumho brand tire for my
bus.  I also had some Tujungal brand (made in Indonesia!) tires on my bus
which were fantastic, although I had never heard of them before.  Maybe
I've just been lucky but it seems like even the bottom rung of tire
manufacturers are quite good these days.
