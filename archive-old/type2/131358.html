Subject: RE: 1700 Or 1800?

From: &quot;Jeff Stewart&quot; &lt;fonman4277_at_earthlink_dot_net&gt;
Subject: 1700 Or 1800?


Going with the
&gt;1800's will mean getting the heads flycut, and I'm not even sure who to 
&gt;take
&gt;them to here in N. Virginia to get that done-anyone know of a good machine
&gt;shop in the N. Virginia./ D.C. area?

Plenty of good shops.  Including Wayne Dittman!!

What would it cost to have the heads
&gt;flycut?

Probably $35 per head if you strip.  I gave a name of a shop in Severna Park 
MD that had a price list on  line

The archives have it at    http://www.type2_dot_com/archive/type2/122189.html

. Thanks for any
&gt;advice

Advice??  Jeff, but my NEW set of 1700 P&amp;C for $125!!

Also, you will probably have to open up the case because of the larger 
diameter of the cylinders.
