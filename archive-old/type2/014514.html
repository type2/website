Hi Mike,

I would suggest that you take a look at the three sliding door tracks.

My previous bus ('73) had a difficult sliding door and when I looked at the three tracks they were all bunged up at the 'door closed' end with dirty, dried up grease; poke gently with a screw driver to remove the grease then apply a coating of new clean grease.

Top and bottom tracks are easy to do, but for the middle track you will have to remove the cover; but that's not very difficult and there's lots in the archive on how to do it.

Good luck

&gt; Greetings Listerinos,
&gt; 
&gt; 70 Bus here.  
&gt; 
&gt; I'm having a little trouble (I think) with my sliding door.  When I close the 
&gt; door (from the outside) I need to push (slightly) against the rear of the 
&gt; panel to seat the door as I move the handle up to lock it in place.  Of 
&gt; course, that little shove one has to give the door makes the door impossible 
&gt; to close and lock from the inside of the vehicle.  That's not right, is it?
&gt; 
&gt; So.........a couple of questions.  Just what is the &quot;action&quot; supposed to be 
&gt; like when the slider closes?  And, assuming mine is a bit stiff, what is the 
&gt; most likely culprit?  I'll get my Bentley out and go through it, but I value 
&gt; the voice of experience first.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks!
&gt; 
&gt; Mike
