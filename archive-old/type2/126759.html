Subject: Re: [T2] Porsche 912 and VW engines

HELLO phil  I gave my wife a 66 912 for her 40th b'day It didn't have a motor 
so I put a 2110 cc Vw in there . Bolts right up to the tranny just make sure 
you use the later pressure plates. You will need to fab a rear motor mount. I 
used 1x1 sq tubingand 2 long bolts and wrapped it in rubber where the motor 
rests on it . Works real well and seems to have more power than the stock motor. 
I am building a 912 motor but my wife likes the Vw with the redneck stinger 
sticking out the back. later and have fun Mark Dearing  Salem Import Service
