&gt; This would make a terrific cottage industry for somebody on the list --

I agree!  but see below.

&gt; The only core that would be required, I think, 
&gt; would be the four big plugs: ECU, AFM, resistor block, and dual relay. 

I *think* the ECU and AFM plugs are &quot;custom&quot; to VW.  all the others are
standard AMP fittings, per John Anderson.

&gt; There must be a source for the small female connectors and the small 
&gt; plugs.

&gt; With a 4X8 plywood board and some hooks, the process could be 
&gt; streamlined. I would certainly pay up to $100 for a fresh harness. With 
&gt; some wise purchasing, the material costs shouldn't run more than $20-25. 

Err...  the materials cost sounds right, or even high (I would have
guessed $5-10, but minimal in either case.  The problem with making money
off making them and the reason it would be a great &quot;piece-work&quot; hobby
kinda thing is that I cannot see turning one out in less that 20 man-hours
(home made and checked, w/o machinery).  If you only charged $100 then you
are valuing time at minimum wage or less.  

I would *love* to see a source for NOS or replacement FI wiring harnesses,
but will not hold my breath :-) Also remember that the harness changed
every year, with the 79&gt; harnesses coming in Federal and CA versions
