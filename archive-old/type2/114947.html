Subject: The Wayback Machine [Was Re: [T2] Bus soundproofing - a
  long-lost URL]

Hi Tom, Jason,

www.archive_dot_org hosts an internet archive with an incredible depth, 
called &quot;The Wayback Machine&quot;. They're doing the impossible: Archiving 
the internet, a page at a time. Type in a URL, and they will give you a 
running history of the page's evolution, update by update.

Last week someone was looking for the Banjapero flash animation 
previously posted at type2_dot_com. Using the wayback machine I was able to 
find this link:
http://benaidan.free.fr/banjapero/Sauvegarde/episode1.htm

Feed your link into it, and you will be able to get the content of that 
page from the archive. But many of the links from that page are not 
archived.

Happy trails,

Greg Potts
