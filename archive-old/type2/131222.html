Subject: my new bus pics - trip report

Made it back from New Mexico to Minneapolis, MN, no problems at all.

I now own a 1981 Westfalia. Different body style than im used to, but same 
old motor.
My first reaction is that the handling is much different. It feels a little 
more like a nice squishy car ride, but then again, my old baywindows 
probably needed some serious suspension upgrades.

1,400 miles in total, most of those done on Saturday when I woke up south of 
Denver and went to bed north of Des Miones Iowa.

Random bits:

1. Ran into someone at airport also flying to pick up a vehicle to drive 
back home.
2. Hung out with stand up comedian at airport bar.
3. Had to drive through crazy typhoon type weather
4. Swerve to miss a baby bear running across highway 25 in New Mexico.

The bus is more than I thought it would be, which is always a nice suprise. 
It has, now, 112k miles on the body, and 27k on the motor. Drives like a 
dream. The previous owner has EVERYTHING that this thing came with, at least 
I think so anyway.

I scanned in a few things of interest, like the originally warrenty book, 
the Westy fridge and stove manuals, and a few others.

Check out some pictures of my new bus and some of the things that came with 
it here:

let me know what you think!

Best,

81 westy &quot;to be named soon&quot;
