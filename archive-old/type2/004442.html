Well here's what happened..... the outer CV was apparently not torqued
correctly when the PO replaced it and 3 bolts came out.... 2 broke off (and
how fun it was getting bolt remains out of those threads) and 1 was bent all
to heck. Thus the joint flew off and made bad bad sounds.... I spent 10
hours (count em)  today replacing the bad CV and cleaning and repacking the
other.... what a mess.  Well my toolbox is a little heaver now (several new
tools were needed) and I own one less shirt but it could have been worse....
I send out a great big THANK YOU to everyone who helped me out and calmed me
down about the tranny :).  One generous soul was even going to sell me a
good final drive for $25! I love you guys :).

P.S.   Sean... Flubbed Up Beyond All Recognition = FUBAR :)

Thanks again
