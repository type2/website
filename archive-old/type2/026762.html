Subject: Public Thanks!

Just wanted to publicly thank some of you who have helped me with this ressurection/conversion of my '72 bus from a sad, pitiful shell of a bus into a lean, mean, fuel-injected camping machine. The journey's not over yet, but the generosity and kindness of list members has really been overwhelming.

This morning Karl von Salzen called me and spent 20-30 minutes helping me with some of the finer details in moving this '77 FI/hydraulic engine into this '72 bus. Then he offered to write it up for me cause he could tell it was a lot to keep up with. The conversation came about because I was looking for parts and he's going to some yards today. Not only did he call me on his dime from CA and offer to look for parts for me, but by listening to my posts, he figured out I was confused on something and kept me from making a big mistake...that I didn't even know I was making. Then he helped me figure out the parts I need. Karl's the same guy who sent me seatbelts a few years ago when I was trying to get my '67 kid-ready and wouldn't take money for them. Awesome!

A couple weeks ago, Andy down in Florida helped me work a deal on some good heads with a guy who is really tough to deal with, especially from Andy's end, where he went over and the guy would sometimes just say &quot;Not today. See ya later.&quot; Sad situation for the dude, but Andy really came through for me.

When I was searching for hydraulic pushrods a few weeks ago, John Anderson sent them to me, after letting me know to begin with that I would need them. Again, he didn't want anything in return; he just wanted to help.

And even with all the troubles I've had with this engine, I really appreciate how Dave Easterwood was so willing to bend over backwards, taking parts in trade and even offering to extend credit when I bought the engine. In fairness to Dave, there was no way he could have known what I would discover about this engine. He did a compression test and heard it run and bought it for one of his own projects. He offered to sell it to me to help me out. And when I started having problems, he was quick to offer to help as he could. Problem is, Dave's about 700 miles from me.

There have been many, many others. You know who you are...and you're too numerous for me to mention or remember. Several folks have recently scrounged through parts to help me find the NLA tranny mounts.

There have even been some off-list folks who read from the web who've come through for me and have been exceptionally good in their dealings with me. One guy sold me a camshaft that he thought was NOS; when it turned out to be one that he was duped on, he offered to return my money when I return the camshaft. Still haven't gotten it to him, but it's nice to know he's gonna be that good about it...and a listee who knows us both wrote to reassure me that he's an honest guy.

Jaime Chrisswisser wrote last night about the web-ring idea and how it could be used to share more and better information. Funny, we've evolved into a global support group that is able to overcome nearly every bus-related problem (with the possible exception of a key stuck in the ignition). I'm proud of you, not that you need me to be, but I am. So many of you are selfless, sharing people and I think it's not as easy to be like that today as it was when I was a kid back in the '60's (Charlie Ford deserves an award for selflessness, if you ask me.).

I know there are people out there who are just in it for the money and they tell on themselves pretty regularly. There are also some good volks who are making money and helping at the same time...good way to live your life, it seems.

Anyway, I was just so tickled that I needed to say &quot;Thanks!&quot; Hope you don't mind.

Thanks! Joe
