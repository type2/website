Subject: [T2] RE: Friday topic: German parts

&gt; On many of the popular vendor websites, you find a
&gt; part listed for $X, and a similar GERMAN part listed for
&gt; $X + 25%. The implication is that the GERMAN part is
&gt;  always better. Can we really go by the reputation of a
&gt;  country? Could not Crapmaster Industries open a plant
&gt; in Germany and pump out stamped pot-metal parts
&gt;  faster than, uh..., something than stamps out pot-metal parts
&gt; really fast? How can I tell if the part is worth the extra money?
&gt; Should I insist on a brand name?


Those are good questions and there is no simple answer.  The short answer,
in my opinion, is this:  A name brand or German part is probably less likely
to be poor quality, but may not always be better quality.  (Got that? :-)
You have to decide whether the risk of buying the cheaper part outweighs the
cost savings, on a case by case basis.

First of all, it's worth noting that German brand, and German, made are not
the same thing in this day of global economies.  Bosch makes parts all over
the world.  I have seen Kolbenshmidt piston rings made in Turkey and SKF
branded bearings made in Malaysia.

Is a German, Name Brand, or OEM Brand part always better?  Not neccessarily,
although in my experience it is almost never _worse_ than an off-brand part.
(While I see no reason why Crapmaster Industries couldn't open a plant in
Germany, to take your example, it is my experience that they generally
don't, probably because of the cost of labor and tighter regulation versus
most of South America or the Far East.)  So for the extra $$ you spend, best
case is you get a better part for your extra bucks; worst case is that you
wasted the extra money and the cheaper part would have been just as good.
So it comes down to whether you're willing to pay extra to possibly reduce
(but not eliminate) the risk of getting a poor quality part.  (Of course, if
the price is about the same, it's a no-brainer.) Some people insist on
German parts whenever they can get them, feeling that it's better to be safe
than sorry (and they're willing to pay for that).  So that is why in some
cases we list both German and non-German alternatives (or original-equipment
and non-OEM brands, as the case may be).

On my own busses, I tend to base my decision on the nature of the part.  If
the failure of the part could damage my bus, cause an accident, or leave me
stranded somewhere, or if it would take a lot of work to replace if it
failed, I'll usually go for a name brand (which is more important to me than
actual country of origin) just to play it safe.  For example, I wouldn't put
an off-brand clutch disk or engine bearing set in my bus because of the
hassle of getting stuck somewhere and having to pull the engine if it
failed.  I'm just not willing to take chances when the stakes are high. On
the other hand, if the part is not so crucial, and there's big money to be
saved, I'll often try the cheaper option, especially if I can replace it
cheaply and easily if it turns out I &quot;guessed wrong.&quot;

Of course, dealing with a reputable vendor is also important. Putting on my
&quot;vendor&quot; hat again, I personally would not sell a part if I were getting
complaints about reliability (except in rare cases where there was no other
supplier and any part was better than none at all).  Any honest vendor will
work that way, and there are a couple of good ones on this list.

And finally, to reiterate a point I've made before on the list, a &quot;lifetime
warranty&quot; is not neccessarily an indicator of a better part.  A cheap,
off-brand part with a &quot;lifetime warranty&quot; is just as likely to fail and
leave you stranded as any other cheap off-brand part, and the &quot;lifetime
warranty&quot; will do you absolutely no good in the middle of nowhere when your
bus is on the shoulder of the road.  If you're going to pay extra, make sure
it's for a better part, not just the same part with a &quot;lifetime warranty.&quot;
