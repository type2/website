Subject: Engine Identification...

Hey ya Guru Volks!

Can someone let us know where or what the info on an engine case
#H245869 is came from originally?

Dave Martin has generously provided &quot;Janis&quot; with a donor motor, (so I owe 
him big time) and I'll be trying to put her in soon (after I dress it up a 
bit and perform the appropriate incantations&quot; into &quot;Janis&quot;.
