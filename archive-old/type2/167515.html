&gt;   Hi Mike,
&gt;   Correct. I have swapped 6-pin and 7-pin setups and not noticed any
&gt;   significant performance difference.

it works both ways, for many years I had a 1800cc true type 4 engine from
a 412 that I used as a spare engine and I swapped the EFI system between
the two, never noticed a difference and they used two different EFI
systems
