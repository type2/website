Subject: Re: [T2] Does your bus stay warm?

OK I know I've told the story before but; I ski and last winter I was up
in Northern Vermont (Killington) in January, was driving along my jacket
open and the window cracked, hadn't stopped since somewhere down in New
York State, but as I pull into town I decide to stop for gas before going
up into the mountains, was on rt 7 so it was probably Rutland.  turned off
the engine in the gas station, and suddenly I was cold.  tanked up and got
the heat going again and see a bank on the way out of town, temp -12F and
the wind was high enough that the bus was wandering.  in other words
   my 78 stays warm, even hot but it took some work.

   heres what I did

the under dash A/C didn't work and there were these great A/C blowers,
so I scavanged up an aux heater from a 412 VW,  25 feet of truck flex
truck exhaust pipe and a little cut and paste and I have the heater hung
under the front of the bus where the evaporator used to be.  A/C blowers
take air from under the dash, blow it thru the new tubeing and then
through the gas heater, then back into the regular heat duct just back of
the front beam...totally removed the stock heat system.

to make sure the windows stay clear a little better I got a set of
electrically heated wiper blades, and now I see and stay warm......! 

and I have it set up so in the warmer months the system will run with out
the heat part so I have some awesome defroster blowers, or just to
circulate a little air up front.

more details on this and other setups should be in the archives
