Subject: 74 and 78 Westy Interiors FS

I came across this in the paper the other day there is a fellow up here who
has two reasonably complete Westy interiors FS that he is willing to
separate.

Please give him a call, he is in Acton about an hour outside of Toronto.

He says he has already sold the cots and the box that goes between the
front seats. He does however have the table that swvels in the back as well
as front seats etc.

(519) 853-1322
