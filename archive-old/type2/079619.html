Subject: Re: [T2] I need equivalent color for 71 Westy [Chianti Red]

&lt;&lt; The paint inside is almost like new and out side needs painting. I went to
http://www.wolfsburgwest_dot_com/colors/7172bus.htm and it lists Chianti Red
only red color for that year. I went to local paintshop and they could not
pull that particular color out of their computer system because the original
is lacquer based and California no longer allows lacquer based paints.  &gt;&gt;

Try

They can probably find/make it.
