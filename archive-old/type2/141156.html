Subject: RE: [T2] Westy faucet from Gowesty

&gt; Get the Bus Depot version. I was in Los Osos over the weekend
&gt; and GoWesty told me that they had run out of the original
&gt; pump. The replacement didn't look like the original.


Actually none of them look quite like the original, although ours is
relatively close. AFAIK an exact duplicate is no longer available. When last
I ordered one from the &quot;original&quot; supplier, it turned out to be the very
same Taiwanese made repro that I can get cheaper elsewhere. Except for one
difference ... the &quot;made in Taiwan&quot; sticker had mysteriously disappeared.
