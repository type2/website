Subject: [T2] Electronic ignition - opinions sought

&quot;As to Compufire over Pertronix... I don't have any real solid reason why
I don't go with a Compufire other than price and more people I know have
the Pertronix than Compufire and fewer knew anything about the
Compufire.  They both have about and even percentage of failures.&quot;

I am not so sure about the Compufire myself but I have a Citroen mechanic
friend who swears by the Allison or Crane systems. He says that the pick up
and units as a whole are much more solidly built than the pertonix units. I
think the sensor, wiring, and control box are much more heavy duty on these
units, but they are a bit more expensive. YMMV

As everyone on the list will tell you best bet is to keep a spare dizzy
w/points all timed and ready to go in case the electronics fail you.
