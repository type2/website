Subject: Tach/Dwell meter wire question. 

Ok, went to the pawn shop down the road, and I found a Sears CraftsMan
Timing Light for $15, and a Sears &quot;Engine Analyzer&quot; (solid state
electronic) for another $15. So I picked up the pair. The usage of the
timing light is pretty straight forward, but on this Tach/Dwell meter it
has the two power leads witch I'm assuming goes to the battery for
power. Then it has another lead that goes to a aligator clip with a
little green rubber boot over it. Does this connect to the NEG on the
coil to sense grounding and thus RPMS? That's what I'm assuming it does.
Now the REALL puzzler is the next pair of leads. These are two black
wires with female blade connecters on them, they plug into a piece of
metal aprox. 3/4&quot; wide, 2&quot; long. It's rectangular with a smaller
rectangular hole cut into the center of it. Then on one side of that
hole is a small round hole, a little bit smaller than a pencil, then on
the OTHER side of the square hole is a notch cut out. Looks like maybe
it could be used to bolt onto something? What is this piece used for? 
 
Anyway, am I right in assuming the dwell meter is used by connecting the
power leads to the battery and the little green hooded aligator clip to
NEG on the coil?
