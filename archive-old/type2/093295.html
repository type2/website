Subject: Diesel as a fuel treatment

Somebody posted this as a possible alternative this morning, here's what a 
friend wrote back to me:

&gt; &gt;A friend of a friend of a friend (in Australia) says gas
&gt; &gt;treatments are simply diesel fuel with some aromatics thrown
&gt; &gt;in. Any comments or knowledge on the topic in VV land?
&gt; &gt; Says you can toss a couple liters of diesel in vs. the gas
&gt; &gt; treatment and gain the same benefits. Would this be safe in
&gt; &gt;an modern car? I envision losing injectors and oxygen
&gt; &gt; sensors...
&gt;
&gt;Diesel fuel is often VERY high in sulfur, so there is some risk of harming 
&gt;these components.  More assuredly though, diesel fuel is REALLY low in 
&gt;octane rating. The whole point with diesel fuel is that you *want* it to 
&gt;autoignite.  I'm not sure why you would want to add it to gasoline (what 
&gt;sort of 'treatment' are you hoping to replace?), but if your goal is to 
&gt;get it to knock like a woodpecker and run on incessantly, it's a good 
&gt;place to start.
&gt;
&gt;SOunds like a bad idea....
