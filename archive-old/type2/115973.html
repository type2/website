Subject: It's a long shot, but...A weird trade offer

Volks:
I have been out of the bus world since I rolled my '71 3 or 4 years ago, but
as some of you know, I did my dissertation on the list, and thus read it
every day.
I have a 1967 Ford Country Squire wagon (390V8, 4bbl) that came back into my
possession after I sold it...(it's a long weird story, but it has to do with
people who buy an old car with no clue about what it takes to make it work).
I don't really want to mess with Karma by selling it again, so a trade might
work.

About the car:
Runs like a top.  New (or rebuilt items)
1. Transmission
2. Radiator
3. Carb
4. Fuel pump.
5. Water pump.
6. Heater core.
7. Exhuast
8. Starter
9. Alternator

A bunch of other stuff I've probably blocked out of my memory.  I could jump
in it right now and drive it to California from the midwest with no
hestitation...But it has various cosmetic issues (a little rust, a rear 1/4
with some ugliness, carpet and headliner).
Car can be seen here :
http://www.stationwagon_dot_com/gallery/1967_Ford_Country_Squire.html (it's the
bottom green one).
Anyway, 
I'm really interested in a Vanagon...for various safety reasons.  A camper
would be wonderful.  I know I could just sell it and use the money to look
for a new vehicle, but I thought I'd try here first.  Help me get back into
the VW world, and get yourself a classic station wagon in the process...
