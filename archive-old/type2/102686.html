&gt; I'm currently re-installing the heads on my 1977 T2 and I'm a bit

&gt; Bus Depot that are metal.  But, the heads already have metal shims.
&gt; Are these shims the original head gaskets or do I add the new
&gt; &quot;metal&quot; head gaskets to the old shims?  (BTW, these are the original
&gt; heads)

There was some discussion a week or so ago about these things. There
are basically 2 camps on this. Those that say keep 'em &amp; those that say
toss 'em. You will have to decide. But...both camps seem to agree that
if you remove them from an engine you really should make up the
difference below the cylinders so that the compression ratio is the
same as it was before. As someone already said remove the old shims &amp;
replace them. This would be the safest/easiest way unless you will
have the cylinders off the pistons. One more thing to note, is there
are heads that have a stepped ridge where the gasket would be.
Obviously you can't remove a piece of the head, so if it doesn't seem
to be easily removed, take a very close look to verify if you have one
of these heads. good luck.
