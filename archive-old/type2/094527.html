Subject: headliner

 
--On my 79 sunroof, the 3 front bows drop into a sheet metal valley above the doors, the rear ones have some kind of saddle that attaches to the bus and then catches the bows lower down. Rubber stoppers in the front, none in the back.

Billy

The bow's don't attach to the body, only the headliner itself. They simply run through the loops sewn into the headliner. Make sure you have the rubber ends on the end of the bows to stop any rattling later on.
