Subject: Mechanical Fuel Pump

     Hi Fellow Listees.

   I pulled the fuel pump off the 73 Westy today as there was a small amount
of fuel dripping from the engine case.(fuel leak repairs are a priority!)
  I was surprised on how easy it went.
Don't let the statement in the manuals(remove engine ) stop you from
attempting this job. Total time for removal, repair and replacement was
under 2 hours.
  I was able to buy an 8mm serrated bit locally to my surprise and removed
the lines (after clamping ) and the pump assembly.
I found the leak source at the fuel fittings so pulled them out and repaired
ala Hoover.
  Replaced the gaskets and installed.
O ya I noticed that the push rod had 2 grooves wore in the middle of the rod
so I stoned them smooth before installation.

     Takin the Contraption for a ride right now.

Bye
