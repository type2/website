Subject: Starting problem - Update

77 2L FI
Small 'update' on my non-starting problem.
I just went out to look at everything, again. The last time I tried to start
it was Friday.
I turned the key to see what happens today, it turned over very slowly, then
stopped turning altogether. I turned the ignition off, waited a minute, then
tried again. This time I got maybe half a turn, then nothing.

Battery still shows good.
Starter? Alt?
Thoughts?
