Sounds like the engine is getting hot, and tightening the valves from
constant expansion and compression, a normal and deadly behavior from a type
1 engine, in a bus, with rebuilt heads....

The valves will begin to stretch, and drop, or they will drop a seat..Find
out why the engine is getting hot, and the problem will be solved with a
valve adjustment....

I see this all the time!

&gt; Argh!
&gt; My 71 westy (1600 DP)with an S.I.R. rebuild with only 8000 miles on it is
&gt; driving me crazy. I went to do my routine valve adjustment, which I have
&gt; done dozens of times since buying the bus last year, driving around the
&gt; country, blowing 2 engines (long story). So I think I know what I'm doing
&gt; with regards to valve adjustment - the bread and butter of VW maintenance.
&gt; Anyway, I started by checking and torqueing the head bolts (all a little
to
&gt; a fair amount loose - maybe 14ftlb to 22 ft lbs. -0 of course only the
lower
&gt; 4 on each, I know that will cause some controvery since some say you MUST
do
&gt; all 8 with engine out...anyway I get equal number of opposite opinions on
&gt; this) then I put on the rocker arms, torqued those, then adjusted valves.
&gt;
&gt; Valve 1 intake  and exhaust ok,
&gt; Valve 2 intake too tight(adj. screw out - no feeler gauge will fit), but
&gt; after unbolting and rebolting rockers ok, 2 exhaust ok,
&gt;
&gt; Then - 3 intake and exhaust - NO WAY CAN I GET A GAUGE IN! even with
taking
&gt; out the screw. I take the rocker arms off a few times, carefully try to
make
&gt; sure push rods are seated well - no luck. I even crank the engine a few
&gt; times to see if they will reseat and loosen up - but no dice. And to make
&gt; matters worse - I look at #2 and the push rod had come off the rocker arm
&gt; alltogether!
&gt;
&gt; Frustrated, I take the rocker arms from heads off my old engine (the new
&gt; heads had only 3000 miles on them. They look so nice, you know?) I was
&gt; careful putting them on , carefully unscrewing all the adjusting screws so
&gt; as not to crunch a valve, #1 intake - first one I look at- now will not
&gt; allow me to put a gauge in, even with screw out. I take out rocker arms
&gt; again a few times - still can't get a gauge in.
&gt;
&gt; What gives? What am I doing wrong? I could shim the rocker arms to get the
&gt; adjustment, but that doesn't seem to fix the problem or discover what I'm
&gt; doing wrong.
&gt; Before doing all this, the bus ran fine, except minor idling problems,
which
&gt; I attribute to valve adjustments and maybe idle/fuel/air screws...
&gt; HELP PLEASE - I'm trying to get on the road for a couple of weeks...
