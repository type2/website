Rick,
 
	I really understand your need for an air conditioning unit. If we had that
kind of temperatures here for a few days it would probably be called a
nature catastroph.

However, wouldn't the noise be a problem on a campground unless you are
alone on the whole place? Don't you go to the campground/nature to
experience the silence and the sounds of birds, bees and wolves howling in
the night? And what would your camping neighbours think about the sound of
this system?

To explain their feelings I can give you an example from our summer cabin
in the finnish archipelago. Our cabin is on a small island surrouded by
other islands with only at maximum a mile of water between them. Our
neighbour on the north side is a person who can't live without his colour
TV. At night when the wind is calming down and only a few birs are singing
we hear a -whrrr, whrrrr,whrrr, whrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr,
continuing all night 'till the damn thing runs out of gas. In the silent
evening that sound can be heard for miles away.

 Please don't do this to your camping neigbours. Find another solution. I
would love to help you but my experience with aircondition units is wery
limited.

&gt;Have you ever seen a tool truck (Snap-On or Mac) with a roof AC unit and
&gt;the generator running?  Around here, they leave the generator and AC on all
&gt;the time, on the road, or parked at a business.  Why can't I do that with
&gt;our '76 Westy?  I would put the generator in a small trailer and pull it
&gt;behind the bus with an extension cord hooked to the bus.
