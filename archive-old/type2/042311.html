Subject: RE:  Extremely HIGH oil pressure

Something that I don't think was mentioned yet (and
from what I have read of this discussion may not be
the problem in this situation) is to check the
accuracy of the pressure gauge and sender.
I made up a testing rig using some pipe fitting and
small iron pipe (I think it was 1/8 or 1/4 inch size)
as needed to connect a dial pressure gauge to a tire
valve and to the pressure sender for the VDO gauge.  I
pump it up with a hand tire pump to a specific
pressure and compare the dial gauge reading to the VDO
(or other brand) of gauge. (don't think it cost more
than $10 or $15 total)
A tire pressure gauge can also be used to double check
the pressure via the tire valve used to pressurize the
device.
I compared my dial gauge with others at my job and
found them all to be in the same range.
I haven't found any glaring inaccuracies in any of the
gauges that I have tested, but it is of course a
possibility.
