Send it to me. I love the oil bath breathers.

He probably gathered parts from overseas - maybe ex-Navy sailor owned van.

I think the air cleaner may be a '70 model air cleaner that was fitted to 
yours. Maybe that was what was laying around at the time.

Your brakes probably need new switches screwed into the master cylinder.

Seriously - the oil bath version might not be good for the air flow meter - 
coating it inside with oil and the temp sensor in there with oil. Dunno for 
sure.


&lt;snip&gt;

The odd thing is the air cleaner:  It is an oil bath (round) mounted to 
brackets suspending it above the center of the case.  the air is going in 
one SIDE and out the opposite SIDE, where it connects to a normal-looking 
airflow-sensor setup and then back under the cleaner to the intake manifold.
