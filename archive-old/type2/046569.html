RMMW has a used parts shop in Colorado Springs.  You would have to call RMMW
(www.motorworks_dot_com) to get the address.  Also www.OeVEEDUb_dot_com  is a new
company in Lake George and I went last August and bought some stuff.  It is
new stuff but cheap price.  I bought a German brake line set for $20 just to
give you a idea of there buys.
Good Luck
Call one of those guys or Randy's Stuff or Painters Grinders and ask them
where the junk yards are
Good Luck
Let me know what you find out
