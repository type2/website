Listvolks,

The baton is in Atlanta, and while I was not the one directly responsible for 
carrying it down there, I got to meet the person who currently holds it in 
their hot little hands.  This is how the story goes:

When I learned from this list that Chris Huff had the case containing the 
baton, I e-mailed her and asked her if it also contained the tape that I had 
made for posterity.  &quot;You mean this 'Riders in the Sky' tape?&quot;  I had several 
question marks floating in the air above my head from this one, but 
subsequently learned that the &quot;Traveling Tape&quot; had been accidentally 
appropriated by fellow list member Skip Correl.  Since I was traveling down 
to Atlanta for a business trip anyway, I offered to bring another copy of the 
&quot;Traveling Tape&quot; to Chris (a thinly veiled excuse to meet a fellow list 
member).  She said &quot;Sure!&quot; and after I had fulfilled my business commitments, 
we met at the same Varsity Restaurant where the Atlanta hand-off had 
originally taken place.  Meanwhile, I e-mailed Skip to see if he wanted to 
keep the tape, mail it on to Chris, or send it back to me.  No answer as of 
yet.

So for your future baton-passers . . . PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE! try to keep the 
&quot;Traveling Tape&quot; traveling with the rest of the stuff in the box.  Make a 
copy of it for yourself if you like.  I have a master copy from which I can 
make more tapes.  If you want one, please e-mail me and I will get it to you 
directly (a $5 contribution to help defray the cost of the blank tape and 
postage &amp; handling would help).

Obligatory bus content:
I saw Chris's &quot;Gus the Bus&quot; today.  Nice.  I also saw (on the way down there) 
a white over navy pop-top Westy (1971?) with big fat tires and no rear 
bumper.  Is it yours?

&quot;May the four winds blow you safely home&quot;
