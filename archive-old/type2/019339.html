Subject: ASI Riviera - Service Manual found for ASI Furnaces

Digging through my desk drawer (an adventure anytime) I came across the
service manual for the Coleman model 4312 Forced Air Furnace that was optional
equipment in the ASI Riviera line of camper conversions.  I suspect that it
was also used on many other US conversions.  If you'd like a copy, drop me a
line and if there's sufficient interest I'll scan it and add it to the Riviera
Pages on the WetWesties website.

If there's NOT sufficient interest, I'll put it back in the desk drawer to
'age' for a few more years.
