Subject: Re: [T2] 2.0 oil drain plug

Although I cannot remember the thread numbers right off, I was able to pick
up the correct plug at Advanced.  Yes it does come with a plastic washer.

&gt; I believe the original plug had a plastic washer that it reusable? I
bought some washers along with a strainer and other items then found I
didn't have a copper washer there. I believe what I have is original. Maybe
someone can confirm this for both of us.
