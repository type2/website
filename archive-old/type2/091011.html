Chris,

I am firmly of the opinion that like Things, the rear vent windows came
stock from the factory with rust in the bottom pivot.  At HCBF, I
installed a Westy jalousie window in Nikki's bus, Wendelin, and the vent
wing we removed from her sliding door had rust in the bottom pivot.  Her
bus has spent its whole life in CA and has *NO* rust anywhere else, but
that pivot was rusty, I would swear from the factory.  Maybe if you could
find a parts bus in Namibia, where it rains once every century...

BTW, tho slightly rusty, those vent wings we removed were the *prettiest*
I have ever seen.  Michael Benthin got them for his bus and if he has a
digital camera, I would love to have a picture...  (Michael???)
