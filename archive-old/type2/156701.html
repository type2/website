Subject: AC compressor conversion question

74 single cab, 1700 CB type IV engine
   
  I just purchased the Sanden conversion compressor and adapter kit from the busdepot and for the life of me I can't figure out how the compressor conversion is supposed to work.  I've got the original brackets from a VPC system and if I use those, the arms will still poke up above the engine tin.  I thought the conversion was supposed to all fit under the tin.  The instructions appear to be for a bug mounting system.   Has anyone with a DPD or VPC system successfully converted to a rotary compressor on your bus and if so, could you share with me how you got the compressor to mount and be able to adjust the belt correctly?  Thanks, Greg
