Pat,
I'd ask for documentation as to the history of ownership, logbooks of fuel 
used, smog checks (which often list mileage and date), service receipts, and 
finally I'd ask about when (if) the tires were changed.
If it truely has only 48k, it may well have the orginal tires and they 
should be well worn (Michelin I would expect) and the sidewall rubber pretty 
well cracked, or they should be all very slightly worn and of the same 
manufacturer, being the first replacement set. What year model is it? The 
spare and the jack should be unused virtually, as should the upholstery of 
the driver's seat. And finally the compression all around should be up to 
spec. You'll know it when you see it!
