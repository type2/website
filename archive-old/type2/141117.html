Subject: Re: [T2] Disc Brake Drag

Still wondering if the pads are to thick.  The calibers are in pretty good
shape, appearance wise anyway.  Checked them against a used set I bought to
rebuilt and powder coat. Looks like the ones on the Bus (this Bus is not on
the road yet. Split window with 79 narrowed bean and 79 MC w/Booster).
Looks like the pistons are drawing back in as far as they can.  I've checked
the rod adjustment under the Bus, as well as the pedal, and it's letting
pressure off.  I bought these pads at a show pretty cheap.  May just deal
with it after Iget the Bus on the road and can run it around some.  Maybe
they'll &quot;seat in&quot;.

         The right side will spring about 1.5 turns on it's own.  The left
is just a bit tighter.
