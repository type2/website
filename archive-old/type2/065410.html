&quot;I checked the battery connections and they seem fine.  Plus, it cut out
while it wwas running, in which case we can rule out the battery, since
you can basically pull the postive terminal off the battery and the car
will still run.

============
Disconnecting the battery while the engine is running (specifically while the
alternator is alternatiing) is a VERY   unhealthy thing to do to your
alternator - potentially fatal to the alternator. &quot;Kids - Do not attempt this
in your car &quot;
