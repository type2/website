Hello busdrivers,

A recurring thread (some would say FART) is the availabillity of new bay
window buses as built in Brazil. As these cannot legally be imported into
the US the listmaster has decided these are off-topic (I don't agree). For
those who want to know all about it I have created a webpage about these
buses. Point your browser to:
http://www.hrps_dot_demon.nl/jwbus/New_Type_2.htm

(Note: On some email readers there appear to be spaces in this URL but these
are underline characters).

Have a nice weekend.
