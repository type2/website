Subject: bus won't start after hyd. lifter inspection

Hi all,

Finally had time this weekend to work on the bus, a '79 CA Westy.  The bus
had been running fine except for a noise which a mechanic described as valve
clatter.  The noise had been persisting, even after the bus was warmed
up and had been running on the highway.  My plan was to check out the
hydraulic lifters and bleed them if necessary (thanks to the listees who
offered advice.)

First, I tried to pinpoint the valve noise by using a long hollow tube as
a stethescope.  Couldn't detect anything from either head cover.

Next, I removed the covers to take a look at the valves in action.  With
the bus runnning, all valves appeared to function well, none appeared to
be stuck.  One strange thing: the inside of the head cover (driver side,
cyl 3 &amp; 4) was really dirty/blackened while the other side was quite
clean.  Also, lots of oil was slopping around on the driver side while the
other side seemed to be less messy.

I decided to start examining the lifters on the driver's side first.  Big
PITA getting the pushrod tubes out: had to resort to pliers and bent up
the old tubes.  The lifters, once out, seemed fine.  They offered no
resistance when I pressed down on the tops with a pushrod (I had followed
the Bently test procedure.)  

So, I cleaned everything, replaced the lifters, installed new pushrod
tubes, reinstalled the rocker arms and spring.  Next, readjusted valves
(two full turns of each screw after zero clearance, with #3 and #4 at TDC
as per Bentley.)

When I tried to restart the bus, nothing happened.  It sounded &quot;weak&quot;
when turning the ignition.  Stumped, I readjusted the valves two more
times, making certain that each cyl was at TDC.  After the third time, I
tried adjusting the timing by rotating the distributor.  Nada.  The valves
do go through their motions while the starter is turning the engine over.
 
What did I do?  I'm stumped!  I must have adjusted the lifters wrong, but
I followed Bently to a T: turned motor till rotor was 180deg from the
notch in the dist, adjusted #3.  turned motor till rotor was 90deg
clockwise from notch, adjusted #4.  Even did it by using the timing notch
on the pulley as described in Muir.  Maybe the pushrod is not seated
correctly?  I dunno...

Also, I am starting to worry that the clatter is not from a valve but
from a rod... oh boy :(
