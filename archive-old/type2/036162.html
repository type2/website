Subject: starter problems

Well to update the list we got the starter replaced but now the van wont
start. There are 7 wires down there Muir only mentions three I think. Tried
testing the starter and it does whir when we do that but it doesnt turn the
motor over. All I hear is a click or two coming from the left front of the
engine.Thanks for the tips on finding the top bolt from inside the
engine,funny it wasnt in the book.
