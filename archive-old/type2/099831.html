Subject: Jamie Rivers' Fall Tour

Hi Volks,

Turnout was excellent considering the weather we woke up to on 
Saturday. All 8 Buses  who came  out had a really great time.

I'll forgo a trip report for the time being and get you straight to the 
pictures. I've lived in Ontario my whole life and I never suspected we 
had such beautiful spaces. If my digital camera hadn't run out of 
batteries there would have been a lot more.

Happy trails,
