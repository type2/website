Subject: RE: [T2] On FI

Cheers Bob,
I'll stow that email and examine it more and see if I
can apply the new system.
I was talking to my VW mechanic the other day and he
says,quite apart from other problems,the reason most
bus owners in Australia tear off the TLE system is
because we can't buy the parts like you guys can.
:-)
Cheers

&gt; Hi Andrew,
&gt; 
&gt; When you were talking about new FI system's on loafs
&gt; I incorrectly assumed
&gt; you
&gt; meant all loaf engines not just replacement systems
&gt; for type 4s. To me its
&gt; not a surprise that there's not a specific 'new
&gt; system' for type 4 engines
&gt; as unlike the type 1 engine they've been out of
&gt; production for many years.
&gt; 
&gt; How ever I'm sure it would be possible to take a
&gt; system off of a modern 2
&gt; litre light truck and use that with suitable
&gt; adaptors and adjustment.
&gt; 
&gt; The system used by VW on the 1600 could be retro
&gt; fitted to any type 1 1600
&gt; dual port.
&gt; 
&gt; There is a different input manifold with the
&gt; injectors mounted near the
&gt; spark plug area. The throttle body is mounted
&gt; exactly where you would expect
&gt; to see a single carb. In side the throttle body
&gt; there is a very fine wire
&gt; which is heated and the control unit measures the
&gt; change in resistance of
&gt; this wire due to the cooling effect of the air being
&gt; sucked into the engine.
&gt; The air box system used on 70s type 4 attempts to
&gt; set the mixture by volume
&gt; of air - the hot wire system set the mixture by mass
&gt; so makes a much better
&gt; correction for ambient pressure / altitude.
&gt; Final correction of the mixture by a lamda sensor.
&gt; No fifth injector for starting.
&gt; 
&gt; Apart from that the system is pretty much black box
&gt; as the control unit does
&gt; all of the work, firing each injector twice per full
&gt; turn of the cam shaft.
&gt; 
&gt; One of the interesting features is the location of
&gt; the fuel pump - inside of
&gt; the petrol tank! which I understand is not uncommon
&gt; on modern cars. Also the
&gt; tank outlet and return are on the top of the tank
&gt; not the bottom. I think
&gt; this is a good idea as there is no chance of road
&gt; damage to fuel lines. Easy
&gt; to inspect too.
&gt; 
&gt; Due to the lambda sensor and catalytic convertor the
&gt; exhaust is very
&gt; different to an 'old' 1600. J tubes lead to a
&gt; collector (no provision for
&gt; engine supplied heat to the interior - vents not
&gt; even cut out on top of dash
&gt; board) and the lambda sensor is mounted where the 4
&gt; tubes meet. The
&gt; Catalytic convertor is mounted across the van with
&gt; outlet to the left. The
&gt; pipe goes from the cat to an exhaust box outboard of
&gt; the left J tube. Then
&gt; on forward to cross the van in front of the gear box
&gt; returning up the right
&gt; hand side to a second box outboard of the right J
&gt; tube. Then a straight
&gt; tailpipe to the rear.
&gt; 
&gt; I used to have a '73 with a 1600 twin port and used
&gt; to get about 25mpg at 55
&gt; and at first was a little disappointed to 'only' get
&gt; 27mpg as the engine is
&gt; both new and more powerfull. But then I realised
&gt; that one of the prime
&gt; objectives of the FI is emissions control which sets
&gt; a mixture which is
&gt; richer than maximum economy so with 0.00% CO and
&gt; 33ppm HC I suppose I'm not
&gt; doing to badly at 27mpg at 60mph.
&gt; 
&gt; Good luck

&gt; Hi Bob,
&gt; I wasn't talking about the current FI that VW uses
&gt; for
&gt; it's Brazilian products.
&gt; I was referring specifically to the 70's FI on buses
&gt; and Type 3's.
&gt; I would like to find out what the current stuff
&gt; is,yes.
&gt; Have you got any more details on it?
&gt; I can get my hands on a free Type 3 TLE engine
&gt; tomorrow if I want it from a friend who found it so
&gt; much trouble he changed to carbs.
&gt; What's the new system like?
&gt; I know it's being used in Europe and the UK on their
&gt; Brazillian imports.
&gt; Of course scoring it in Australia for a decent price
&gt; is another thing entirely:-/
&gt; Cheers

&gt; &gt; Hi Andy,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; You seem to rather poorly informed about the
&gt; current
&gt; &gt; status of FI for aircooled busses and bugs, as
&gt; both
&gt; &gt; are CURRENT PRODUCTION items from VW. Your 67
&gt; panel
&gt; &gt; van would love to have a 64HP 1600 dual port FI in
&gt; &gt; it.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; A 67 splitie being lighter than a Bay/loaf I would
&gt; &gt; expect you to get better mpg than the 27.5 at
&gt; 60mph
&gt; &gt; I get in my camper.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; This system does not need tinkering with, I've had
&gt; &gt; it for 3 years with 0 maintenance.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Good luck
