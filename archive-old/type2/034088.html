Subject: Stalls after 5 seconds

My 2.0 liter FI engine is stalling after about 5 seconds of running, or
when I put the gas to it. If I disconnect the plug to the AFM, I can get it
to continue idling, but it will stall if I give it gas.

I was confident it was a vacuum leak at the brake booster, but that's not
completely supported by data.

Help me Obewan, or I fear I will have to leave for work around 3:00 AM so I
can idle the 10 miles there. ;) Joe

P.S.  Actually, I'll probably work at home tomorrow--since I've been
transferred to a department where that will no longer be possible
(effective Jan 1)--so the drive is not *really* an issue. Thanks! Joe
