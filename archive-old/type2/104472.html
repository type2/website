Subject: Re: [T2] engine problems

&gt;If you recall we started that heated head gasket strand about our '78 
&gt;bus.  We had the head gasket replaced but then the bus ran terribly. Our 
&gt;regular mechanic says that when we had the head gasket done it caused the 
&gt;compression to go up which caused it to suck in a valve seat. So we have a 
&gt;bad valve on the number one cylinder.  His solution is to get a rebuilt 
&gt;engine, the thinking being along the line that if we replace any more 
&gt;parts it will just cause other parts to go bad.  We can not afford a new 
&gt;engine so I am considering dropping the engine myself and and slapping a 
&gt;new or used cylinder head on to keep it going.  Any advise?  Does anyone 
&gt;have a good cylinder head?

Get rid of your mechanic. I doubt his abilities based only on what you've 
written. Rebuild the head. Use someone who does alot of VW work or at least 
aircooled engines work. If you can afford it R&amp;R both heads. New valves, 
guides, measure everything, new gaskets.

If the rest of the engines is poor rebuild it. It's an adventure...

Good time to repaint, clean, and replace anything rubber.
