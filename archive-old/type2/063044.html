Subject: reply: NE Ames Graveyard

Greetings 
Does anyone know the name of the VW graveyard that was 45 min or miles North 
East of Ames. Would that be near Cedar Rapids or Des Moines? I am originally
from Cedar Falls, IA (North East Corner) and would be interested in stopping 
there on my trips home from Ark. 
Peace
