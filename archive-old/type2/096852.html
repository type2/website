Subject: muir and the 1.7, 1.8, &amp; 2L cranks

i read in muir that one way a torque a flywheel sans the proper flywheel
lock is to get a rag on the teeth of a monkey wrench and apply that
sandwich to the fan hub while someone up front sockets down the five bolts
to proper spec. two things: i'm wondering of this is how my woodruff key
and its slot were a little munged; and second (unrelated?) on the front
where the flywheel attaches, my surface is uneven. i didn't notice it
before i put it on, and now i suspect it could be causing .005 -0.10
flywheel run out. is this cause for alarm?   - steve
