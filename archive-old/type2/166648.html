Subject: Re: [T2] Popped valve seat picture

Did you have a cylinder head temp gage, it would have
told you to slow down and cool it off before any head
damage occurred, a oil temp gage will tell you when to
back off when the oil temp goes up. Hot oil will gall
a piston. Both gages work in unison to tell you how
the engine is doing. You could run water injection to
bring the head temp down. Climbing mountains with a
bus is always a spot to watch closely, they are engine
eaters. Phil
