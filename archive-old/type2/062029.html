 &gt; My dad had two cars, a '63 camper bus and a '60 Chrysler
 &gt; (BIG fins).  The Chrysler also had push button drive, as
 &gt; you may recall.  Dad found that the slightest touch on
 &gt; the reverse button and the backup lights would come on.
 &gt; His method, then, of shucking tailgaters would be to 
 &gt; turn on the backup lights at, say, 60mph.  It really 
 &gt; worked...

When my Dad was Military Attache to Poland ('63-'65) he used to be followed by 
the UB -- Poland's equivalent of the FBI, but less polite -- who would make 
sure he didn't photograph any secret military installations.  Since part of 
Dad's job was, in fact, to photograph secret military installations, he used 
to try to dream up ways to escape thsi surveillance.

He installed a switch on the car he drove to turn the tail- abd brake-lights 
off, regardless of the state of the headlights.  Then one evening when he was 
cruising along he spotted a big dip in the road, flicked the switch, carefully 
slowed and drove over the dip, and continued along.  The UB folks came tearing 
along to catch up to the terrible capitalist pig-dog spy, didn't see the dip, 
whammed into it and broke an axle on their Mercedes.  Dad, being a nice guy, 
went back to see if they needed help.  He says he learned eleven new Polish 
curses that evening.

Dad then drove off before their backup could arrive and, I guess, successfully 
did whatever it was that capitalist pig-dog spys do...
