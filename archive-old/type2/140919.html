Subject: Re: [T2] Oil Leak - Larger than normal

If you did add to much oil it would have looked for anyway out. So you maybe
OK I would de an oil change add the correct amount of oil and watch for any
leaks. Do you have an oil pressure gauge?


Subject: RE: [T2] Oil Leak - Larger than normal


&gt; I went out and let the engine idle and also put loads on it. I don't see
the leaks happening anymore. Which I find very odd. Also, the oil level on
the dipstick is full. Could I have to much oil in the crankcase and such it
was running out of the blowby tube?
