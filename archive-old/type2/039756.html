&gt;Volks,
&gt;    In reading this post it just occurred to me that on my last oil change
&gt;for my '77 westy I put HD 30 penzoil oil in that engine.  I consulted Muir

consult the owner's manual

&gt;miles, I am concerned about what type I should have put it.

Excellent

  I figured the
&gt;HD type 

HD=high detergent, typically, if it doesn't say non-detergent, it's high
detergent, since the 60's.

would be no harm but I may have figured wrong.  I am leaving for
&gt;Alaska in a week and will change the oil once again if it seems important
&gt;enough for the well being of my bus.  Please help me with this one.  I
&gt;didn't even really think about it till just now.

Consult the owner's manual. Use the multi grade oil shown that best fits
the ambient conditions expected. For most temperate zones, that's 10/40 or
15/40. And make danged sure you use the OEM filter. No alturnatives as yet
proven to meet spec. Many alturntives proven to create problems.

Safe travels to you, and keep asking questions.
