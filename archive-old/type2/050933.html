OK, a few more questions: What is the little gray bag for? You show it on
your picture, I have it on the 69 Cabinet I have, but it is not on my 71 or
73 cabinet.
Also, what year were the grab handles added? Yours has none, my 69 part has
none, but I see them on my 71 cabinet and on others 71s.

Sure.  Not the best shot of the net...but its there.
