Hello
I was wondering if anyone could tell me if this idea I have is a bit on the 
crazy side...
I have the chance to buy a 71 transporter with a brand new 1400 engine for 
$3500. This bus is in great condition. However what I really need is a 
pop-top.. would it be crazy to take the pop-top of my 74 westy and put it on 
the 71 transporter... would I be breaking the law?

thanks
dready george (dredlock420_at_hotmail_dot_com)
74 westy... or is that rusty?
