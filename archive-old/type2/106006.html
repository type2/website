Subject: Re: [T2] Trying to understand about that part...

My fuel pressure regulator has a vacuum tube size nipple which has never
been connected to anything.  I was under the impression that the connection
is there to vent fuel in the event of a mechanical failure in the regulator.
Does it really control the regulator's function??

I was going to hook it up to a vacuum line in any case...
