Subject: FI piston quench area

Hi, was just viewing Adams teardown for sparkplug fix, and noticed the 
pistons have a large recessed area in their crowns.  Mine do not, and mine 
is a carbueretted, 1974.  Since the motor in question, Adams, is an FI, it 
got me thinking, why the piston crown recess.  I think there was no HP gain 
when VW went from my motor to newer FI, so was it for better &quot;burn&quot;, and is 
there any advantage to using the newer pistons in older motors?  TIA
