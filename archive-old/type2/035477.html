Not to be gross but that happened in my old 71 and I was told from this list 
that you have to worry about the urine or poop from the mice cuz it could 
cause some disease if humans breath it daily....but I guess you would 
breathe it unless the heat was all hooked up correctly.

anywayz--CLEAN THOSE DUCTS!!

Nothin left to do but smile, smile, smile!!

&gt;My heat ducts were packed with mouse nests and perhaps 5 mouse remains.  At
&gt;least they were comfortable.
