Subject: [T2] Busses by the Sea Update 9/15-9/17

Ok, Im sure some of you were wondering if there was gonna be any more
updates to this.  Well here they are.

1.  Sadly, the entire Island is booked for reservations.  If you didnt get a
reservation, you might be out of luck unless someone wants to share a space
with you.  There are 2 vehicles allowed per site.  There is a chance i might
have a free space at my site.  If so I will gladly give it up to someone who
needs it.  I'll let the lists know if this is the case.  If anyone else is
willing to share please let me know...

2.  I'll need everyones names that they registered under as soon as
possible.  I will be calling the campgrounds thurday to arrange for our
sites to be grouped together.  Please let me know if you are ocean or
bayside.  I will do the groupings for both sides.

3.  CARAVAN/BUS.......  Please let everyone know who is coming from where.
I'll compile everyone who responds to me into a list and we can just reply
from that to make caravan arrangements.

4.  Please bring...  Firewood, bugspray, food items (let me know if your
bringing enough for many or feeding solo), utensils...

4.  This is a Camping free for all....  There are no planned events other
than enjoying each others company and setting some large fires on the beach.
There is plenty to do though.  Canoeing would be a great activity.  Im up
for suggestions on anything.

I'll be arriving early at the campgrounds on Friday morning...  More than
likely i wont be around though, my 64 light blue/white split will be though.
I'll be in and out all day getting supplies and such for the weekend.   If
you see a convertible ghia cruising around feel free to wave me down and ask
questions.

My daytime # is 410 723 2702
     nighttime  410 289 7177
     cell          443 497 3171

Dont hestitate to call any of these numbers if you have questions.  Call my
cell if Im not at the first two numbers. 

Emmet

P&gt;S&gt;S&gt;S&gt;S     PLEASE FOWARD THIS TO THE VANAGON LIST!!!!   Im not on it.
