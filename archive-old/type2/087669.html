Subject: Re: [T2] '78 Can't get idle going fast enough - FIXED!

&gt;Maybe the pump switch in the first air box (pin 36 and 39 ) would not =
close
and the pump was dead. Then you turned the pump on with the second box.&lt;

Thanks Chuck. I think my pump was running (the bus would run, it would =
just run at too slow of an RPM), but you reminded me of this switch and =
that may help Matt G. who has been going through similar (but different) =
headaches with his bus.

I've been thinking more and I know what caused my AFM to die. In the =
course of getting the bus running, we managed to cause some back-fires. A =
couple of these blew off one of the large tubes that connects to the =
S-tube. I'm thinking that one of these also damaged something in the AFM. =
That is a lot of air pressure going the wrong way.

Thanks again,

Mark
