Brandon,

How about a little more information:  Questions:  Is the engine in tune?
Check the timing.  Make sure it's set correctly.  Do you have all the
correct cooling tin in place?  Is your v belt adjusted properly?  What
weight oil are you using?  Are all the engine compartment seals there and in
place?  What do you mean by fry's the engine all the time?  Do either of the
red lights come on while your driving?  How do you drive it? just around
town slow, or lot of high revving?  freeway-- high speeds?  You say it
overheats.  What tells you this? When you touch the dip stick is it too hot
to handle?  Do you have a heat gauge, and oil pressure gauge?

There is more, but, we can start here..

I know of a couple of different people who have driven through LA in the
last week in the heat of the day *on their way to the redwoods in northern
cal* both of them had to stop and let um cool  down when they hit LA......

&gt; Anyone have any ideas, or know any tricks to keeping a vanagon engine
cool?
&gt; I live in LA and it overheats and frys the engine all the time. I am
looking
&gt; for some ideas on what to do in order to make the engine run cooler?
&gt;
&gt; Thanks,
&gt;
