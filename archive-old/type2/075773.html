Subject: Exhaust nuts

Hey Snoopy
I found that stainless will still sieze to a steel stud.  There's a fastener
place not too far from where you live that has Brass nuts.  M&amp;M or something
like that off the exit towards your place from the airport (Remount?).  I
bought a lifetime supply and if you can wait for snailmail, I'll send ya a
set.  Let me know tonight and I'll mail 'em out tomorrow.

&quot;I read somewhere that 77 per cent of all the
mentally ill live in poverty. Actually, I'm more intrigued
by the 23 per cent who are apparently doing quite well
for themselves.&quot;
