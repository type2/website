Subject: Ignition &quot;upgrade&quot; (was: Re: Possible engine for the Bus)

Hi,

 (sorry, volks: this got a bit long... :-(   ).

&gt; I've got a '72 Camper I'm trying to make purr.  It's got a strong 1700
with
&gt; the original Solex duals and I'd appreciate any thoughts on upgrades or
&gt; fixes that will increase it's power, efficiency or longevity.  I know
about
&gt; changing the oil, warming the engine before driving and getting the valves
&gt; adjusted regularly, any other tips, gurus?  William mentioned upgrading
the
&gt; ignition system...?

 That would be me!

 After a few years, I got fed up futzing with the points on my bus
every few thousand miles (or putting up with rough running as they
drifted out of alignment) and put in solid state replacements. Soon
afterwards I added a Capacitive Discharge unit to improve spark
quality. I am led to believe that the &quot;pointless&quot; ignition is not
necessary if you have the CDI, but since I already had it I didn't
remove it.

 It can be argued that this isn't an upgrade (the stock system is
proven reliable and wont leave you stranded if it fails) but for
me the savings are worth it. I carry a set of points and a
condensor in the van and could put them back in if I had to. IMHO
solid state electronics are fundamentally more reliable than
heavily stressed mechanical switches.

 Technically this isn't an &quot;electronic ignition&quot; in the true
sense of the term, since the timing is being controlled by an
old-fashioned distributor rather than an electronic control 
unit with inputs from throttle, head temp, engine speed etc.

 With the disclaimers out of the way.... I used a Pertronix
points eliminator (a Hall effect design, not an optical one).
 These are available in two versions: one for centrifugal 
distributors (the &quot;009&quot;) and one for vacuum distributors
(stock). IMHO you are better off with the stock distributor,
but either way the fit is easier if you get the right one.
 This unit simply replaces the mechanical points (and the
associated condensor) and eliminates the problem of them
getting pitted (&quot;burning&quot;) ie wearing electrically and
also of the rubbing block wearing down mechanically. It
stops you having to adjust the point gap and timing but
doesn't affect spark energy, so don't expect any 
performance improvement.

 The CDI unit I used is the Tiger CDI from Universal Corp
of Grand Junction, Colorado. This is a box that fits 
between the points (or Pertonix) and the coil and provides
current to the coil. It increases spark energy, which can
improve combustion under poor conditions (eg better cold
starting). Some claim an mpg improvement but I didn't
see any significant change. Since the CDI unit reduces the
current through the points it extends the life of a set
of stock points by minimising the pitting effect- with only
the mechanical wear on the rubbing block you can get tens 
of thousands of miles out of a set of points with only 
occasional adjustments. This is why you don't necessarily
need both items. It is also very easy to take the Tiger out
of the system and revert to stock if you suspect it of
failure.

 So: four options, there:

 1) Stock
 2) Points eliminator
 3) CDI
 4) Both

 Your call according to your assessment of the cost/benefit advantages
of each. A lot comes down to your trust in things mechanical against
your trust in things electronic. I think Pertronix are about $50 and
the Tiger about $100, but that's from memory. You can buy a lot of
points for $150, but then you can spend quite a bit of time futzing
with points.

 On your other points :-):

 I try to change the oil every 3,000 miles, as VW suggested. Many folks
	say to change more often.
 I use a good straight 30W oil (suits my climate).
 I don't warm up before driving: Muir says to do so but VW says 
	don't and the list concensus is with VW.
 I check the valves every oil change.

 I'd recommend you get hold of the &quot;Hoover Sermons CD&quot; (sources should
be at the type2 website) and enjoy the writings of a genuine guru.
We can all learn a lot from Bob Hoover.

Cheers,
	 W.
