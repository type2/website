&gt; It was a part on the left side of the engine compartment, fastened to the
&gt; sheet metal.  It was roughly the shape of the vacuum assembly that is on
&gt; the distributor, but larger.  It had some wires coming out of it, so
&gt; presumably it is some sort of vacuum-actuated switch/pot.  The part number
&gt; I could make out while shining a flashlight on it is 022 906 281.  Hopefully
&gt; that's correct -- it was getting dark outside :-)
&gt; 
&gt; I'm guessing it's either emissions-related, or fuel-supply-related, but
&gt; that's just a WAG.

It's not a decel valve, it's the electrically operated vacuum can EGR system
for the early 76 busses.

Is there a long tube connecting it to the air distribution box (plenum)? Is
it blocked off. Blocked off at the plenum?
