X-Diagnostic: MESSAGE MAY NOT BE TOPICAL - S

Preparing for the coming camping season (just got my new Komet (that would
be a great name for a bus) side tent, thanks Steve) and I decided I would
try to clean the fuzz or flocking (or whatever it is) that is on the inside
of my poptop roof. I have a 78 non-VW (American Camper I think?) westy
converted (via interior swap) to a deluxe westy and the inside poptop has
yellow velveteen style fuzz on it that is somewhat discolored from mildew
or something, grayish-black stains. I tried to clean it with a solution of
bleach and water and discovered it's pretty easy to accidentally scrub off
the fuzz.

Has anyone found a good way to clean this without removing it, or removed
it and replaced it with something else? I assume it's there to absorb
condensation to a certain extent, so it doesn't drip on you.

Thanks
Jeff
78 Camper
