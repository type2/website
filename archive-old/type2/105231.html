&lt;&lt; Are there any compelling reason why I would not want the HapyBus registered

Depends on your state of residence.  In Oregon, RV registration is more 
expensive, but your insurance is cheaper.  If it has &quot;sleeping&quot; and &quot;cooking&quot; 
facilities, you have to register it as an RV here.
