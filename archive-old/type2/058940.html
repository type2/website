Mike,
 I had an old Saab that did the very same thing,  turned out to be the
same problem I had  had in a Bug several years earlier --- Bad
Distributor.   The thing had gotten so worn that when  it was under
load, things wouldn't line up quite right and it would cause misfires in
the spark.  Once replaced my problems went away,  I hope it is that easy
for you and that this helps
