Subject: pop top to moon roof

I am thinking of removing my pop top (no tent) and using the hole as a moon 
roof.  Has anyone done this?  I don't really want a rag top.  I am hoping to 
shape some dark plexi and use some sort of tracking.  Any advice would be 
appreciated.

PS I have an original radio from my bus that I don't use.  My bus was 
imported from Germany and has the UMF frequencies.  I am thinking of putting 
it on ebay.  Any interest?
