&lt;&lt; Why is it that when you see someone driving a bus down the highway at full 
speed,  they are always leaning so far forward that their head is almost 
hitting the windshield?  &gt;&gt;

Tension...No matter what ($16,000 bus or no), it's a 20 + year old vehicle 
you're
drivin'. It's that &quot;What will go feelin' ?&quot; that makes you tune in to the 
sounds and
&quot;feel&quot; of the bus as it hurtles down (can't be up, can it?), the highway...
