Subject: re roof racks

NRS sells these.
http://www.nrsweb_dot_com/shop/product.asp?pfid=3200&amp;deptid=1203
called quick-N-easy car top racks.
As your bus has the rounded roof you will need to
make a 2&quot; or so spacer to go on top of the tower. 
Very sturdy. you cant lock them on but I have had mine
on for about 8 years with no problem.
