&gt;Hey Richard! After reading your posts and thinking about previous threads on 
&gt;the subject, I did some searching. The DIY project used a one-wire sensor 
&gt;and explained it essentially worked as a volt meter. What are the extra 
&gt;wires for on multi-wire sensors? I've found 2 wire and 4 wire sensors. What 
&gt;exactly is the broadband concept in oxygen sensors.

Wide band means they measure from 12:1 to 20:1 AFR . The narrow band ones used in the bus and by other simple ECUs (and the $100 AFR gauges) only measure a limited range around 14.67 because they basically act as a switch (lean/rich).

The extra wires are for heating elements, signals from multiple cells within the sensors, etc.
