Subject: Re: Leaking Cover Gasket

I know this was posted last week but I just got back from camping (Pat the 71 westy did great!).  I know most of us have had a leaky cover one time or another and the last time I adjusted the valves I couldn't get the darn things to stop.  Well, I called my trusted vw mechanic and he gave me a suggestion that seems to work like a charm.  (all of this assumes that the covers are in good shape, you have fairly tight bails, and you have seated the gasket properly) When you replace the cover move it around a bit to help seat it properly, then when the bailing wire is back in place, firmly pull the cover down (towards the ground).  Thats it, it seems to work.  I hope it helps.
