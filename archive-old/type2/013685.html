&gt;Hey, if I can beat Gensler's Porsche-powered bus through first 
&gt;and second, I can beat you guys too.  Bring it on!  :)

David, you just got lucky and caught me with my RPM down!  And let's clarify:  
it was YOUR first and second gear you got through - I had just shifted to 
second (at 33 mph) where my power really comes on.  And when I hit 3rd at 55 
mph, watch out!

&gt;I know there are some other closet racers out there - So who wants 
&gt;to help set up the first annual type2 drag race in the Central US?  
&gt;I'll bring my spare CV joints...

I'm kinda thinking about entering the VW drags at Bandemere after the RMMW show 
this August.  I think I can take those 300 hp drag-bugs...

Actually, there was a guy that entered his stock 64 bus last year.  I don't 
understand drags, but apparently you win by staying closest to your time each 
time?  Anyway, it was kinda fun watching.  He'd start off, people would go get 
a beer at the concession stand, and come back and watch him finish :)
