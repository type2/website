Subject: Re: Heat!!! installed new B1L compact

Since a considerable number of people are interested I will put up a 
page with the details of installation and copies of the manual etc.
Until I get around to answers the burning questions first of all:


I bought a Eberspaecher B1C compact including the basic installations 
kit (cable harness, exhaust and air pipes, fuel pump and lines etc) 
and a control thermostat via a company that builds ambulances for 
1300 DM, the normal list price would be closer to 1500DM .
The equivalent in pounds would be aprox. 400 pounds or 600 $.
In comparison to 800 pounds in London.
I have not considered replacing my heat exchangers due to cost but 
figured that this set up will last very long and can easily be taken 
out again if I ever change cars.
Installation for a recirculating setup took 6 hours from opening the 
box to van cleaned up and ready to go.

It takes about 5min. to heat the van from 5C to comfortable when the 
heater goes on full blast, it then runs quietly in the background 
without too much noise.

I have a BN4 which I am trying to fix up for a friend (still need the 
overheat safety switch, help!!) and the new B1 is ALOT more 
sophisticated and VERY safe.

Hope this helped a bit,
LAter more,
Lukas

&gt;  &gt; Dear All,
&gt;  &gt;
&gt;  &gt; I got fed up without hear and non of the recommendations on the list
&gt;  &gt; have convinced me so I have bought and installed a new Espar
&gt;  &gt; B1Lcompact heater that runs off petrl and works extremely well.
&gt;  &gt; If you are interested in the details I will put some pics of the
&gt;  &gt; installation and setup together and put them on the web.
&gt;  &gt; Only if there is some demand though.
&gt;  &gt;
&gt;DEMAND! DEMAND!
