Subject: Last &quot;working Around&quot;

Took &quot;better half&quot; over pass to West Coast of Island, in winter after I
thought I had fixed heater problem in '75 Westy.  &quot;better half&quot;, had complete
Eiderdown Mummy bag on and was reading book.  Lotsa elevation and flat land,
and coooollld!  Went to pull off at rest area, but boots were frozen to Westy
carpet, and would not release, so whole carpet was lifting!  Finally managed
to turn around, but all was locked up, so continued on and kept feet &quot;tapping&quot;
to any song on radio or that I could remember, and actually hoped for the
uphill turns to move clutch pedal etc!  Wife just read book and was warm, and
said trip was great!  Just perspective I guess!!
