Subject: Advice Sought - Trans Compat/Seal Leak
To: type2_at_type2_dot_com

Hello type2 list. Hoping my credit is still good in the seeking advice 
column. Just towed my bus across the country and am temporarily settled as a 
guest in a high-rent district which doesn't take kindly to VWs with leaks of 
any kind. Neighborhood watch, yapping poodles, and all that. Before I can 
escape (Find Job, House, etc) My transmission wasn't working right. Through 
grease and some coupler massaging, I've settled that problem down. 
Transmission is now working okay. However, I developed a bad main seal leak 
(by the bell housing) to the point where it must be renewed immediately. As 
I'm a guest I'm in a jackpot, removing oil stains with bleach furtively in 
the night. 

Anyway. the issues:

The motor is a decent mystery 1974 1800 with good compression that I've put 
200 miles on since installation. I don't remember if I changed the main seal 
200 miles ago or not. I definitely didn't check the endplay measurement or 
change shims as I was in survival/escape mode. 

The flywheel measures 218mm across the ID where the pressure plate sits. I 
assume this means it's a 215mm flywheel?

The pressure plate and disc are definitely a 215mm set. The bell housing is 
an 002. The transmission is an 091 from a 78 bus. The 091 input shaft is 
original, uncut and uncensored. This makes getting the engine in and out 
difficult. I was reluctant to cut the input shaft as I'm building a 2 liter 
and didn't want to gore the 091 for future 2 liter use. I also don't have my 
number one toolkit with me yet, still in NY in the fastback and this 
heightens the improvisation factor.

So my questions are: 

1) Can I run a 1800 with a 215mm bell/clutch successfully with an 091 with a 
long input shaft as I have done for the last 200 miles, without causing 
premature main seal failure, or could this be a main contributor to the leak? 
Is there any other reason for cutting the input shaft, other than ease of 
engine install/remove?

2) should I look elsewhere for a cause of the main seal leak - specifically 
endplay and shimming, or just chaulk it up to a worn seal, replace the clutch 
with a new 215 set, pilot bearing etc. and be onto my job hunt?

options include digging out my 091 bell housing and flywheel, buying a 
starter, fork and clutch for that if I need to, but I'm worried then about 
fitting the whole thing into my 72 bus, as I've heard it's longer with the 
091bellhousing. 

Also I'm working on the budget of a harried and unemployed and workspaceless 
man
who just needs to make the thing not leak while I straighten out my gig. Any 
advice welcome. 

Happy year of the snake,
