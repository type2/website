Subject: Update on &quot;Bizzare failing under load, 75 FI-fuel delivery low?

Re the 75, which was dying under load so I had to drive in first......
Checked timing, advance, dwell, OK.  Attached a fuel pressure gauge and
had a friend watch it as we drove.  Bus started ok and revved fine in
neutral, pressure went to 35, leveled off around 28-30.  Went up the
local steep hill, and he noticed it dropped to 17 psi under
load.....this is not good, right?  So we suspect a fuel delivery problem
(blockage or weak pump.)  Had no time to deal with it, and parked it
outside.  Next day, it would not start (cold, like 15 degr out)(turned
over ok, not a glimmer of it catching, not even with ether sprayed into
air intake.  Fuel pressure read 28 psi.  Had someone crank it as I
watched; seemed to be weak white spark compared to the strong one on our
78.)  Jon told me not to spray into air intake, but yank the poly tube
from the intake manifold connection to brake booster and squirt in
there.  I also cranked it with a jump from another car, and it started.
In garage I checked the delivery by placing tube from pressure port into
a jar...did about 3/4 cup in 30 seconds, which according to Muir is too
low??  Tomorrow I will drain the tank and check the fuel filter and
likely check line from tank, maybe blow air up the line and pull sender
&quot;replacement cover&quot; to check inside tank.
