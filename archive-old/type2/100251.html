Subject: free icebox (Eugene, OR)

Hey all:

I have an icebox that I took out of my hard-top camper.  It has a cool 
mirror and vanity shelf on one side of it, as it sat up on the counter.  
It's in decent shape (the door sags) and free to a good home because all its 
doing now is setting out in the rain.  If someone in the Eugene area wants 
it, that would be great - I'd rather not fool with shipping....  Stevo - you 
want it?

Contact me off list if interested.
