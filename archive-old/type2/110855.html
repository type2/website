Subject: Re: [T2] Any thoughts? my engine is running rough

Hello Richard,

I compared the part number from The Bus Depot and the
part number at Pelican Parts for that item and they do
not match. I wrote Pelican parts and asked if the 2
gaskets were interchangable. I do not remember what
their exact reply was, but I was led to believe that
it would not work. I will go ahead and order it anyway
if you think it will fit. It does not cost that much
and it is woth a shot. I just wasn't sure if it was
the same diameter. Thanks for the insight. I had tried
several bus suppliers and they said that they were
NLA. Thanks again for the tip. It has to be better
than what I cut out of a sheet of rubber. Thanks!

Regards,

David Kelly

&gt; 
&gt; I always check the 1.8L 914 part vendors for
&gt; compatible bus parts.
&gt; 
&gt; Have they gone NLA since my last posting. AA says it
&gt; has stock or do you
&gt; mean another gasket?
