&gt; &gt;In case you haven't noticed, the front of a Bus is shaped like a brick
&gt; wall.
&gt; &gt;In order to get a Bus to go 90MPH without straining the engine, you'll need
&gt; &gt;many hundreds of horsepower...so yeah, a Winston Cup race engine will
&gt; &gt;probably do it. Maybe.

&gt; I have a photo of the spedometer in my 78 westy _at_ 86mph with a stock 2.0
&gt; litre engine. Its possible. It wouldn't take much of a grade before this
&gt; dropped.

Here's a picture of a Vanagon dashboard and GPS with 97MPH on the dials.
Powered by a 2.2 liter Subaru engine.  Vanagons are larger and draggier
than bays.
