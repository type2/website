&gt; Probably more of an economic decision than anything else...$10-
&gt; 12,000 is a pretty big investment to risk on a daily driver...It makes
&gt; sense to conserve the vehicle to preserve its resale value...;-(
&gt;
&gt; OTOH, it could just be practicality...Unless you're a VW aficionado,
&gt; it's just much easier/comfortable/safer/etc. to drive a modern car/
&gt; van on a day to day basis... ?-)
&gt;
&gt; jWe've spent something is excess of $17,000 so far on our bus.  It  
&gt; isn't
a 'daily' driver but gets used 2 - 3 times a week and trips away on w/ 
ends
and vacations -- 5-6,000 kms in 3 weeks then.
So we take care of it and hope that maybe one day if the time comes to
have to part with it (dire necesity only) we may get most of our  
'investment'
back.  For us, the 'investment' is free accommodation when we travel,  
the
freedom to camp where &amp; when we wish (within legal bounds), the room
to sleep the 3 of us and enjoy the time on the road as a family.
Suddenly the money doesn't seem that important.
