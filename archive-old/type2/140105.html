Subject: Re: [T2] sliding door won't pop open

&gt;Are you sure this isn't a winter problem with the seal sticking to the door?


seal?? SEAL??  what is this 'seeeel' you speak of?
actually, it has THREE seals - or parts thereof: the top has a 
nearly-new  seal i was able to salvage off a basketcase 72 i bought 
in austin (daily driver my ass - the cam  gear wobbled nearly 30 
degrees due to loose rivets!); right side has a WCM portion from 
another donor, and the bottom and left are the original crust-like 
seal from october 1969!
i'm aware that this is part of the problem, but the thing was working 
fine till a week or two ago.
