&gt; Jake, Doc, list:
&gt; Doc Ric really had 2 questions here, compression ratio being the main one.
&gt; What is really important is that the c/r not be set too high. Opinion
varies and
&gt; expected gasoline quality would determine this (though recent drive
reports from
&gt; Mexico indicate this is less of a problem than it used to be).
&gt; The maximum c/r would be somewhere in the 7.5/1 area and if you are close,
&gt; better make sure you are accurate. Many would prefer a number more like
6.9-7.0.
&gt;
&gt; I  am of the belief that higher compression is free power, but of course
it
&gt; comes at the slight cost of shorter engine life.
&gt; A few minutes spent with your machinist and you can either have him cc
your
&gt; heads or explain how.
&gt; Second  was your statement about balancing. You really need to balance the
rods
&gt; end for end (IOW even out all the big end weights and all the small end
weights
&gt; and then recheck the big ends). Many years ago I worked in a high
performance
&gt; machine shop and balanced many rods. They use a special rig with rollers
and a
&gt; counter balance, but I'm sure you could rig up something with knife blades
and a
&gt; gram (dealers') scale.
&gt; Balancing the reciprocating parts (pistons and rods)  only will give you
the
&gt; best return on investment, if you are on a tight budget. I'd guess a shop
would
&gt; do it for about $50 or so.
&gt; Higher quality pistons like Mahles and NPR's were almost always perfect
from the
&gt; factory.

&gt; &gt; &gt; I argue with the doc as much as anyone, but I had this done to my
2liter
&gt; &gt; &gt; when it was rebuilt and I can vouch for his observation,  however it
is a
&gt; &gt; &gt; diminishing returns sort of thing, the closer the balance the more it
&gt; &gt; &gt; costs, I think VW allowed 9 grams out before a rebuild and 4-5 grams
at
&gt; &gt; &gt; rebuild...I found that a good compromise from perfectly on$$$$ and way
off
&gt; &gt; &gt; was at 1gram, so I had my pieces and entire assembly balanced at
&gt; &gt; &gt; 1gram..(didn't do the flywheel because I don't have one (auto
&gt; &gt; &gt; tranny) added about $100 to the cost of the job

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;I am set to go on building the new engine.  I should get the case
back
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Friday, and upon inspection the machinist said it looked to be in
very
&gt; &gt; good
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;condition.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Anyway, with NEW jugs and heads, do I have to measure the CR? Seems
&gt; &gt; like an
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;extra job that I could do without right now. (Novice here)
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; What, you mean you will tear it down and do it later??? Should
always be
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; verified. Deck heights should be matched. Combustion chambers should
be
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; matched for volume. Good money spent to have your machinist do this.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;I have a gram scale to check the rods. Should I check the new
pistons
&gt; &gt; as
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;well?
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Most certainly. Also, the rods should be balanced end to end and
total
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; weight. I would also spent the money for the machinist to do this.
Also,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the crank and flywheel should be independantly balanced, then bolted
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; together and finish balanced as a unit. If all this is done right,
that
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; motor will idle and run so smooth it will put a smile on your face
every
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; time you fire it up for the next 100k, assuming maintenance by
&gt; &gt; inspection.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; And balance as well the valve springs, meaning their pressures at
both
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; installed height and at lift height.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Balance = harmony = efficientcy = longevity = best cost per mile,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; regardless the cost, which is value. Leave all this out and what you
&gt; &gt; have
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; is GEX. It will cost only some 10% more in time/money to have a
balanced
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; assembly. This is pays off bigtime in results.
