Subject: Cleaner air

To All:

A recent thread has pointed out that our old Volkswagens fall into the newly
created catagory of Gross Polluters.  And yes, the new pollution laws are
aimed directly at us.

Air cooled engines use a part of the incoming fuel charge to cool the exhaust
valve, meaning the air-cooled engine will always have more unburned
hydrocarbons in its exhaust than its water-cooled cousin. But it doesn't have
to be that way.   Adding air to the exhaust stream (smog pumps) to facilitate
after-burn, and a catalytic converter farther downstream can take care of the
unburned hydrocarbons.  This is the method used on Mexican bugs, whose fuel
injection set-up gives you an engine that cranks out as little as 7ppm of HC
_at_ 2,500 rpm, a figure as good as any water-pumper.

But that doesn't change the cooling requirements.  Larger diameter valve
stems helps -- the Type IV should give you the clue -- as does the use of
sodium-filled valves... at sixty bucks a pop.  If you can cool the exhaust
valve you can change the cam profile to give less wasteful overlap, improving
fuel economy and further reducing the need for after-burn, catalytic
converters and so forth.

But under the present smog laws, doing such things is illegal.

So while many will charge the waving flag of cleaner air and become embroiled
in the arguments of the greater good, the relatively minor point of limiting
the useful life of automobiles BY LAW will slip past unnoticed.

Come on now -- we know CARB and all the other 'clean air' agencies don't give
a shit about cleaner air -- if they did they would welcome methods of
cleaning up the emissions from older vehicles.  But they don't.  Indeed, they
make it as difficult as possible to legally modify older models.  Indeed, the
various 'clean air' agencies are as highly politicized as any bureaucratic
entity in the country -- and we know politician is just another word for
crook.  If we take 'Deep Throats' advice and 'follow the money' it's plain to
see that American politicians at every level work for whoever pays them the
biggest bribes.  And when it comes to 'clean air' and other matters
automotive, the money points toward the automotive industry, automotive
dealers, and the hanger's-on who will run the new Super-smog check stations.

The bottom line?  It's very likely that with cars lasting longer (and costing
more) someone simply decided to come up with a legalistic means of limiting
how long you can own your car.  One way to do that is to convince the public
that old cars are 'bad'.  

Clean Air, Apple Pie &amp; Motherhood!  Let's get out there and stomp all those
dirty, old Volkswagens!

Waytago, Ami-Rica!
