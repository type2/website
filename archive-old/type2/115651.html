Subject: Re: [T2] Overhead AC

The westy roof has a different headliner and is not the same curve as a
passenger roof.  Also if you have a &quot;big top&quot; pop up ('74-'79) the overhead
console would fit half on the ceiling, then hang over into the pop top
opening.  It would be difficult to pull the pop top release.

I have a number of overhead AC evaporator units and was trying to figure out
the same thing, but no good.  This is the reason on westy's they used the
under dash evaporator, not an overhead unit.  The problem with the underdash
model is it is too low to mix the cold and warm air, so you get a large
temperature difference between your head and your feet.

About the only good solution to AC a westy is to use two units, one under
the dash, and one in the overhead cabinet at the back.  Another solution
could be like they did on the ealier bay westies and put the evaporator in
the sink cabinet and cut a hole in the top for a duct to come out of and
deliver the cold air front and back from the ceiling.  Of course if you have
a stove this wouldn't work unless you put it at the other end and got rid of
the water storage, but you would have to cut through the lid.


&gt; All this talk of consoles and the pic that was posted got me thinking about
&gt; the 
&gt; stock overhead AC system for the bus. Does anybody know if it will fit in a
&gt; Westy?
