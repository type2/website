&gt; O.k. this is coming from left field, but I've read about a few others who 
&gt; have seen it done.  I would like to put oak hardwood floors in my 71 westy.  
&gt; I have the entire rear interior stripped out right now, and have a bunch of 
&gt; oak and plywood left over from doing the floors in  my house.  It seems very 
&gt; possible to attempt it but I have a few Q's. 

&gt; Will the height of the subloors, and oak combined cause a disturbance
&gt; with the bed and tall cabinets

yes.  The finish floor should be ~3/16&quot; above the door sill.  If you try
to run the wood strip flooring under the cabinets, they will come out too
high.

&gt;  Also,  I would seal all the wood including subfloor before puttting them in, 
&gt; but will moisture still be an issue? 

Yes,  but not any more than it was on the original floor.  Use exterior
grade plywood, seal it, and you should be fine.

&gt; Would it be o.k to run some wiring for guages under the floor before I
&gt; install it?  (I was envisioning a wire cooking in a puddle of water
&gt; under there someday)  

Yes, it would be fine to run gauge wire under there.  I would not run 110V
or 220V wire, but you will never electrocute yourself on 12V.  If you tape
it into the bottom of the corrugation, abrasion should not even be an
issue.

&gt; Speaking of the subfloor, I've read 3/8 and also 11/32, and 13/32
&gt; plywood.  Which is the correct one to level it out? 

Take a long straight edge, run it from door sill to side wall and you will
see that the corrugated floor sits substantially below the sill level.
the 3/8&quot; fiberboard underlayment sits on the corrugated area *only* to
build it up level with the sills, then a ~1/8&quot; piece of masonite is laid
on top of the fiberboard, extending to the sill edge.  The finish floor
(linoleum in the early years (thru '73), carpet in later years) is laid on
top of the masonite.

You can certainly run strip flooring on top of the masonite layer, but not
under the cabinets.  there may be interference with the bottoms of some of
the doors, especially the cooler cabinet on the '68-73 layout, but that
cabinet could be adjusted up pretty easily.  

My big question is how do you intend to fasten the strip floor down?  I
this image of a pneumatic nailer punching cut nails thru the sheet metal.
Then I see the big belt sander going in to do the whole 2 square meters of
floor.... OK, my mind has boggled :-)

There is a new kind of flooring out these days that would seem to be ideal
to achieve the effect you are seeking.  It is some sort of laminate on a
backing board and is ~3/8&quot; thick.  While thicker than the stock finish
floor, I don't think it would raise as many height issues and it is
designed to be glued down, so it would fasten to the masonite just fine.
It is also prefinished and hard so that wear and tear will not be as much
of a problem (I am still typing because I am having a neuron misfire on
the name of the damn stuff) I can't remember :-(  I think Formica makes a
variety of it.
