Subject: [T2] missing thermostat

Listees,
Thanks for the valuable advice. From the description given by many of you, I think I'm missing all the parts. The bus has a replacement engine and the wizard that did the work probably left out the tins. I believe the engine is from a typeI. Already replaced the muffler from a 1200 that was rigged to asphyxiate the driver.
    Do you have any idea if the cooling system parts are available anywhere? Sounds like my engine will definitely suffer for the lack.
