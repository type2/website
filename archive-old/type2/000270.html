Hey there 007,
Just the leaker.  This is one area where you can't really &quot;maintain&quot; it
preventatively.  If they are not leaking you just can't do any better than
that no matter how good a job you do.  There is also no real labor saved by
doing them all now.  It's not like the upright engine where you have to pull
the head.
Good luck!
