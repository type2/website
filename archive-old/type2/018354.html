The subject says it all.  '68-'69 model year, bus  front beam.  New
brakes installed.  Sold drum to drum.  Has wide 5 drums on it.  Torsion
arms can be adapted to fit later model disc brakes.  This is a bolt up
without modifications to a '67 and older bus.

I am located in Long Beach CA (SoCal) area.  I can bring it down to the
OCTO meet if you decide to buy it.

$125 OBO.
