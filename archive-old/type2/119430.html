You can pull the generator without much trouble

You MUST leave the fan behind, in the shroud

reach around in front {FIF} with a ratchet and socket, 32mm iirc
lock up the belt pulley with a screw driver as in changing belt procedure
undo the nut on the fan, let the fan, nut and washer sit in the shroud

then you have to remove things like, intake, carb, maybe the generator
stand, I forget
it has been a while since I worked on a T1 in a bus,

you don't have to remove the shroud

Hope that helps
