Subject: Re: [T2] The Woes of the Fuel Filter Change

I use small/medium sized needle nose vice grips with tape over the 
grooves to protect the hose and then clip on the hoses with just enough 
pressure to shut of the fuel flow.
Excess pressure or forgetting to tape up the teeth on the pliers means 
new hose.  The do make professional clips for the job as well but never 
saw the need for another tool in my rather massive inventory.

&gt; Hi,
&gt; Can anyone tell me a way to change my fuel filter without getting a full
&gt; stream of gas pouring out onto my chest from the fuel tank line?  Out 
&gt; of all
&gt; the jobs one has to do on a bus, I dislike this one the most.  Nothing 
&gt; I use
&gt; ever closes that line completely shut, and I always end up soaked in 
&gt; gas -
&gt; every time.  Plus, the fact that there is so little arm room under 
&gt; there (I
&gt; don't jack up the bus for this) makes it hard to manuever and get outta 
&gt; the
&gt; way in the first place.  I'd sure like to know of a better way, because 
&gt; I am
&gt; tired of waiting months for my clothes to not smell like gas anymore 
&gt; after
&gt; each filter change.  Thanks!
