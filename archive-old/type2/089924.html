&lt;&lt; I'm posting to both lists, since (I think) it's a drum brake issue.

First best guess would be brake hardware...letting the shoe hang
up and drag. In any event, checking the brakes is a good idea, since
'64's have single master cylinders (IIRC), and damage to a wheel
cylinder means no brakes...8-(
