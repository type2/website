Subject: BA4 heater in a Bus
Date: Sun, 08 Nov 1998 02:28:51 PST

Hey Y'all 
  I was wondering is it posible to mount a BA4 heater into a Bus? Its 
mounted in a 411 now and I can get all of the parts that are needed for 
the install. Is this a good heater to do this with? I can get this 
heater in a whole car fairly chaep and would like to put the heater in 
my Bus and scrap the car, so I can get everthing related to the BA4. Any 
inputs on this would be very helpful. The Bus is a 70 non-westy.
