Subject: Battery specs: was Chunder in right valve cover - what is it?

Thanks, Bob!

Ultimately,  I'll get a battery with:

1) the proper dimensions so that I can clamp it down
2) the posts on the inboard side of the battery (+ being forward, - 
being aft) so that they're easily accesible

I usually don't have problems cranking in cold weather, but I guess 
that with greater CCA's, there is more reserve should I partially 
discharge the battery whilst camping.

1) What battery (specs) do you use?
2) What battery matches the criteria noted above?

&gt; I measure my space and buy the biggest battery that I can stuff into 
&gt; the
&gt; avaliable space.   got twin (both sides) 950cca batteries in 
&gt; there...they
&gt; are a real trick to manuver in but they have been worth it....
&gt;
&gt; YMMV
