Hi Eddie,

I think you are describing a Type 3 pancake engine (the type 4 is a new design
and some refer to it as a &quot;suitcase&quot; engine to differentiate it from the
earlier type 3 engine.  The cooling fan at the rear of the engine is a clue
and from your description, it is not an upright.  The type 3 engines did not
have a seal installed between the engine tin and car body sheet metal.  A tin
piece was mounted to the rear of the large fan housing and contained the
generator pulley, fan belt, and engine pulley.  An oval shaped cooling bellows
connected the cooling air inlet on the tin piece mounted to the rear of the
fan housing to an opening to the air duct built into the body and vents near
the top of the rear fenders.  Since the cooling air was provided from a
location removed from the engine and exhaust heat, no engine tin to body metal
was required.

Look for a Squareback, Fastback, or Notchback Type 3 and ask the owner to show
you his engine compartment.

I think you could fabricate some ductwork from the engine cooling air inlet,
&quot;Y&quot; out to run up to the top of both bus body cooling air inlets.  And maybe
put a &quot;U&quot; shaped connector at the top of the tube or pipe as a limit on rain
intake.

&gt; Ok. For the time being this 1500 is gonna go in my '74 bus
&gt;  This is a 1500 out of a '67 bug (i think).
&gt; My question is does anyone have any good methods on how to cool this
&gt; thing. The way the 1500 works is that the
&gt; belt pully has a fan on it that sucks air into another fan that blows it
&gt; at the cylinders and to the generator (etc) through a thick steel
&gt; housing. How should I go about doing this as efficently as possible?
