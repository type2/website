Subject: RE: [T2] Running Hot 

Ok , any ideas I have done the timing - my tin is good ,flaps are fully
open, cleaned all the goop off the engine bottom and oil cooler- fresh oil -
bus is running very well - I have a Mallory oil temp gauge that came w/ the
bus - anybody with any experience with them - I wonder if it is working
properly - it will flick in time with the signals and I have noticed it will
flick with the lights and also move as the clutch is depressed and the
brakes applied - the connections seem ok - the sensor is a probe screwed
into the bottom of the engine
The bus gives no sign of anything being wrong outside of the temp gauge. The
dipstick does get pretty hot

Any thoughts
Eric

yes, allow the springs to pull them to rest, the thermo pulls it closed
