&gt;Fellow listees,

&gt;I have been having some problems with my 74 1800 as far as low power and
&gt;excessive fuel consumption.  I am going through the Bently manual and
&gt;carefully following the procedures for adjusting and balancing the carbs (I
&gt;am running stock dual solex 34 PDSIT-2/3).  I came across the part about
&gt;adjusting the dashpot and discovered that I do not appear to have one.
&gt;Question 1 is; what does the dashpot do for the carburation system?

I think it prevents the idle from dropping too fast.  The engine runs
cleaner when the engine speed does not decrease quickly.

&gt;Question 2 is; would this cause the low power &amp; excessive fuel consumption
&gt;problem?

Nope.

A little history:  I have a new AVP engine with approximately
&gt;1100 miles on it and have rebuilt the carbs.  If anyone out there has any
&gt;ideas on these problems, please enlighten me.

Low power and bad mileage indicates that you might be running very rich.
Do you know what size your main jets are?  On your engine, 127.5 would be a
little lean, 130 and 132.5 would be about right, and 137.5 would be rich.
Also, check your fuel pump and make sure it isn't leaking.
