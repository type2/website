I guess I should have said.. &quot;CHASSIS GROUND GOES TO NEGATIVE!!!&quot;.. 

hehe..

&gt; Er, never say never, last westy I bought had a red ground wire, went to
&gt; charge the battery and had to look twice. My mind said red=positive, my
&gt; subconcious asked why it was on the wrong side of the battery. Lesson here,
&gt; always question what the po might have done.

&gt; 
&gt; &gt; RED DOESN'T GO TO NEGATIVE, RED GOES TO PLUS!!!!!!!  Beat that in your
&gt; &gt; head over and over and over!  And then one more time!
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I think it's probably safe to say that red is always positive, except in
&gt; &gt; some special wiring situations, but more often than not, it is positive!
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Don't hook it up the other way unless you want to FRY everything.  If
&gt; &gt; you have any radio's or other devices, those are prone to FRY too!!  My
&gt; &gt; friend fried his amp by hooking it up backwards.. that was a costly
&gt; &gt; mistake.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; The negative terminal should be hooked up to the ground wire.  That is
&gt; &gt; the wire that goes straight to the chassis.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; And when you hook up an extra jumper battery, you hook + to + and - to
&gt; &gt; -, not the other way.  By doing this, you put the batteries and parallel
&gt; &gt; and increase the amps available to the starter.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I'd first hook your battery up the correct way.  Hook up the wiring
&gt; &gt; harness with all the red cables on it (and a big fat (probably black)
&gt; &gt; one that goes to the starter) to the positive(+) terminal and the other
&gt; &gt; braided one that goes to the chassis to negative (-).
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; put in the new one, and test out the voltage at different points in the
&gt; &gt; car.  Fuse box is probably a good place.  You should have 12v on your
&gt; &gt; meter.  This is with the key off.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Then try and see if the car will start.  If it does, go and test the
&gt; &gt; voltage again and it should be running at around 13.7 volts.  If it is,
&gt; &gt; your voltage regulator is still working correctly.  If it's higher, then
&gt; &gt; it's not working.  I don't know the reprocussions of having a bad
&gt; &gt; regulator so be careful..
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I don't how else you'd check your regulator, but I'm sure if I missed
&gt; &gt; something that someone else will chime in.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; good luck!

&gt; &gt; &gt; Hello,
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Lurker named Milo here.  I've got a problem in my '69
&gt; &gt; &gt; Westy that
&gt; &gt; &gt; I probably shouldn't have, but nonetheless - I do...
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; I left it at a friend's house for a few weeks, came
&gt; &gt; &gt; back, and the
&gt; &gt; &gt; battery was dead.  Simple enough I thought - I hooked
&gt; &gt; &gt; jumpers up
&gt; &gt; &gt; to it from my car and it started right up.  But as
&gt; &gt; &gt; soon as I unhooked
&gt; &gt; &gt; the jumpers, it died.  This is stange I thought!  So
&gt; &gt; &gt; off I run to the
&gt; &gt; &gt; store, fork over some bread for a new battery, and
&gt; &gt; &gt; think - I hate
&gt; &gt; &gt; buying a new battery but this is simple enough, quit
&gt; &gt; &gt; complaining...
&gt; &gt; &gt; Little was I to know!
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; I get back, and notice that the red cable in the back
&gt; &gt; &gt; of my bus is
&gt; &gt; &gt; indeed, hooked up to the negative terminal, and that
&gt; &gt; &gt; when I jump
&gt; &gt; &gt; started it, I had the + from the car hooked up the -
&gt; &gt; &gt; of the bus, and
&gt; &gt; &gt; vise-versa....  Well, that explains why she wouldn't
&gt; &gt; &gt; stay running.
&gt; &gt; &gt; And man, was that battery hot when I took it out of
&gt; &gt; &gt; the bus!
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; After second guessing myself a few times, I conclude
&gt; &gt; &gt; beyond a reasonable
&gt; &gt; &gt; doubt that yes - the red should go to the negative
&gt; &gt; &gt; terminal, etc.  Man,
&gt; &gt; &gt; was that hard to do though!  Something about hooking
&gt; &gt; &gt; red up to negative
&gt; &gt; &gt; that really goes against the grain ya know.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; My problem is this.  My red light is now on, and I
&gt; &gt; &gt; seem to recall
&gt; &gt; &gt; somewhere that what I've just done is reversed the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;charge&quot; in the
&gt; &gt; &gt; generator - not sure if that was Muir, Usenet, the
&gt; &gt; &gt; list, etc.  But
&gt; &gt; &gt; I seem to recall reading this.  The archives couldn't
&gt; &gt; &gt; bear this out
&gt; &gt; &gt; however.  Hell, maybe I dreamed it sometime, but it's
&gt; &gt; &gt; my hunch.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Anyone have any suggestions from previous experience?
&gt; &gt; &gt; Did I fry my
&gt; &gt; &gt; Voltage Regulator, ruin my generator, or just put a
&gt; &gt; &gt; magnetic hex
&gt; &gt; &gt; on the gennie that could be removed by a shop w/ the
&gt; &gt; &gt; right type
&gt; &gt; &gt; of magnet.  Any and all suggestions would be greatly
&gt; &gt; &gt; appreciated!
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Geez, if I'd have just shut the key all the way off
&gt; &gt; &gt; before taking
&gt; &gt; &gt; off that one night none of this would have
&gt; &gt; &gt; happened.... *sighs*
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; THANKS!  Milo
