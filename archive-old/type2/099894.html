Subject: Oil change interval

Well, it's been 3000 miles and I my first oil change interval is upon me.

The VW manual says change the oil every 5000 miles but I never used to do this years ago.  Why did they recommend this?

I've been using sythetic oil and the oil stayed golden for much longer than the dino based oils I've used in the past.  I've had to add some oil to keep the level up but it's still black so I'm wondering what exactly turns it black? Is it a change in the composition (viscosity breakdown) or is it contamination from blow-by?

If it's contamination what is this doing to the lubracating properties of the oil even though you haven't reached the end of oil change interval.

BTW, I'm going to install a temperature sender I took from a 914 in the sump plate and replace the leaky gasket there while I'm at it.  Someone told me once I have to shave some of the end of the dipstick to get it to clear the temp sender?
