Subject: To spray or not to spray???

Hey Y'all,
I've got the 1500 SP engine out of my wife's ride in
order to do a front oil seal replacement. While I've
got the engine out, I tore down all the tin and am
going to pressure wash it and paint it. Here's my
question:  The longblock is pretty grimy, dirty,
messy.  I am tempted to hit it with the pressure
washer, would anyone recommend AGAINST doing this???.
I know that I don't want to get water in any of the
ports or anything.  Basically, it is the cylinders and
case that are really grimy.  Any advice or
suggestions?? 

Peace, John Baker
