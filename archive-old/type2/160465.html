&gt;We live in los Angeles, I'm looking for a

&gt;should look out for? Good or bad?

Verify good drainage such as no evidence of standing water in or 
about the units.
Take a look at the width between buildings. If someone brings in and 
parks a big
moving van, will there be enough room for you to get by??? Many will 
have a single
light fixture, no outlet to plug in a drill or vacuum or drop light 
or such. It's
a storage space, not a work shop.

&gt;Has anyone had experience with car storage?
&gt;I'd want to be able to access the car whenever I 'd
&gt;need to.

Most have restricted access (coded gates) and limited hours, like 7am to 9pm.
