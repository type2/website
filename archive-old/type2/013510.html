&gt;I had a hard time getting the oval copper seals to stay in the right 
&gt;place as I put the manifolds back in the heads.  I think they did not 
&gt;seat correctly.So two questions for you all:
&gt;First, should I get new copper seals or can I use the old ones?
&gt;Second, how do I get them to seat correctly?  

You should always use new copper gaskets.  Being copper, they get really hard 
after heat cycling a few times.  The new ones are nice and soft and will help 
you get a good seal.  Easiest way to get them to stay in place is to smear some 
thick grease on one side and stick it up into the head.  The grease will hold 
in place quite nicely while you put the heat exchangers up.  I like to use NEW 
copper nuts to hold everything in place as well - you can get them from any VW 
parts dealer.  You should also check them after a few days and snug them up if 
needed.
