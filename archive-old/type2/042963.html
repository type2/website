Subject: Oil Sump Heater

Thanks to everyone that replied to my previous post about the Oil Screen. A 
few people have suggested that I have an Oil sump Heater which makes sense 
since I have a plug coming out the back under the bumper like a block 
heater. My next question is how do I go about getting the oil screen out?? I 
can't see any bolts where the pipes meet the sump and I'm not sure how to 
get in there. When I have done previous Oil changes I have just drained the 
Oil from the plug and changed the filter but never could find the screen. I 
didn't understand where it was since all the books show it as being a 
circular plate with 1 bolt in the middle and I didn't have that...only these 
pipes coming out of the sump.

Thanks in advance
