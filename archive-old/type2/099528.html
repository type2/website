Subject: Re: [T2] Bus body is rusted badly/considering getting a new
  body.

&gt;Well, I went to start banging all the rust away, and man, there is a lot more
&gt;than I had intentionally thought. The top end of the van is great, but as
&gt;usual the bottom end is rusting in huge amounts. I will need to have like 6
&gt;or 7 replacement panels welded in. I have never welded before, and I imagine
&gt;paying someone to do it is going to be outrageously expensive.

Check with the local community colleges. They may do the work for cheap 
just to have a vehicle to work on...
