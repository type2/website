&gt; Hi All,
&gt; 
&gt; I just reinstalled the engine in my '74 Bus.  I've been stuck in the engine
&gt; compartment for a week and have that not so happy feeling :-(
&gt; 
&gt; The engine was running fine when I removed it for restoring the bus six months
&gt; ago.  After reinstalling I found the starter, which was fine before removal,
&gt; now to be bad.  After a new starter the bus now turns over fine the engine
&gt; just does not fire.
&gt; I didn't mark the wires when I removed the engine and am now regretting not
&gt; doing so.  Here are some questions for the experts.
&gt; 
&gt; 1) what wires are the bare nessesities to make a coil shoot a hot spark from
&gt; the coil to the distributor? What is the best method for testing the spark?

power from the battery (via ignition switch) to the + &amp; the green wire
from the distributor are all that it needs to run, if the carb has a
fuel cutoff solenoid you will need that powered too. I have always
just used the visual spark test like you have done to test spark.
 
&gt; 2) I have one wire from the distributor going to the negative side of the
&gt; coil.  On the positive I have the ignition switch (which is hot when turned
&gt; on), electronic choke to carb, fuel pump (I know that's dangerous), and one
&gt; that I think goes to the back-up lights.  This combination shoots a orange
&gt; spark with both a brand new coil and the coil that was on it when I removed
&gt; the engine.

What about the points? are they adjusted correctly?

&gt; 3) I have tried a brand new distributor (009) that I had in the garage with
&gt; the same results, only an orange spark.

it could just be a low battery.

&gt; 4) I have not tried new plug wires as they were good when I removed the
&gt; engine.  I have tried a wire from another old set and still just the same
&gt; orange spark.

at least it's consistant :)
 
&gt; 5) Should the orange spark start the engine? Maybe there is something else
&gt; preventing the engine from starting?

could be. I'd double check the spark plug wire routing. if it's off
the engine will either not start or run horrible.
 
&gt; I sincerely appreciate any advise, the bus has received too much verbal abuse
&gt; this week, and I feel like jumping off a building :-(

hang in there, it's something simple. Especially if it was running
well before the engine pull. Aside from the spark, did you verify if
you are getting fuel?
