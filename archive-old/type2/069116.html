Subject: First Engine Pull : Questions

Hi there,
        Well, I have a few questions I meant to place in my last
post.  I just pulled my first engine and am tearing it apart, not the
case though as the engine is in pretty good shape.  Low compression
but you'd never know it, it is/was running great and reliably, and a
little oil leak, but not tooooooo bad:)

Anyway, Here are my future plans and a few questions I have, in case
someone has a moment and a desire to share some opinions. 

I have to remove pistons and cylinders, decide whether to
  a) reuse them
  b) put new rings on them and &quot;hone&quot; the cylinders.
        A local shade tree mechanic said the type 4 pistons and
        cylinders re-ring up real nice.  Bob in his &quot;jugs&quot; sermon says
        ring jobs on a VW never work?  Since most of his Sermons deal
        with type I engines, anyone have an opinion (Bob?) on how the
        type 4 engines fair, or should I just go for option c:
  c) buy new pistons and cylinders ($300.00)


New push rod tubes and seals.

Clean the heads up.  I have two pair sitting in carb cleaner.  I'll
wash them in a few days.  Remove the valves and mike them.  Pick the
best pair (I have two sets) and lap them.  The other pair I'll
rebuild after this caper is over. 

On both pairs there are a few studs missing! (exhaust on both pair I
believe)  What can I do about this?  

Water got inside the crank case when I cleaned it, 

I will also possibly replace the front and rear oil seals.

No plans to replace my clutch, since it was working fine when I took
it out.  Maybe this will come back to bite me though...

I think that is about it.  Before installing it into the new bus, I'll
be cleaning up the engine compartment in that bus,...

Any advice or tips would be great.

take care,
        brandy
