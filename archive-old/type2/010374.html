While it's very unethical, it's very common to have a car/parts
sold out from under you.  It's happened to me a couple of times, which is why
I never tell anyone about a pending deal until cash has changed hands and 
it's done, preferably once the car's in my driveway.  I once told
a local about some ribbed bumpers I was buying off the 'net, and  lo
and behold, I got snaked.

OTOH, most of this stuff is first-come, first serve.

I've even had the price of an item suddenly rise after payment was sent,
and had emails to back myself up, to no avail.  That was just plain
theivery.

In either case, the &quot;blame&quot; in this case rests just as much with the
seller as it does the buyer.  It can be very tempting to the seller to
take the quicker-to-close deal.  When I was selling my '56, I had
a Japanese gentleman hounding me to sell the car to him instead; he
had ready cash and was ready to fly up immediately.  I'd promised 
it to the first guy, and given him a very generous amount of time to come 
up and complete the sale, and stuck to it.

You might try to work on the seller instead; if the upstart hasn't the
cash on hand and wants to horse trade and make payments, whilst you
have cold hard greenbacks on hand, that could make the difference.  
Personally, I'd never let someone &quot;make payments&quot; on a car.  If they
don't have the cash now, what guarantees that they'll have the cash later, 
especially once theyhave their new toy and start sinking money into 
iit to get it running.  If an $800 project bus is beyond their means, 
then getting the thing up and running is probably beyond their means as well.

Just my opinion.
