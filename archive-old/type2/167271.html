Subject: Re: [T2] 72 tranny needed

Hi Matt,

All righty then; I do indeed know how it goes as I am currently  
driving a 1979 chassis with a 3-rib 1970 transmission in it. Or I  
would be driving it, if I hadn't blown up my replacement engine  
yesterday. (Grumble grumble).

For simplicity's sake I would recommend you seek a 6-rib transmission  
from a 76-79 bus. Depending on how your 6-rib was installed, swapping  
back to the original 3-rib configuration could possibly require a  
bunch of other parts, like a flywheel, clutch, nose-cone, starter, etc.

If you do know exactly what you have and you've decided to go back to  
a 3-rib and don't need to know any/all of this, please disregard.  
Just trying to help.


Happy Trails,

Greg Potts
