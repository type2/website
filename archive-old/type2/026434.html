I've just fitted a new stainless steel exhasut to Ashley my '71 camper. Got
it from Volksbits (UK Listee &amp; firm). It cost £49 and fitted very nicely,
much better than the last bug one I fitted. Biggest problem was the tailpipe
as I had to order one of these as well and it took a bit of bending to bold
on properly - DPO had fitted a Monza 4 tip which had become more hole than
exhast.

Vey pleased with the result. I wasn't sure about the stainlessness of the
piece (it looked a bit dull) so I shinned a bit with Brasso (metal polish)
to check &amp; it came up very shiny. Don't plan to do much of this though !
Sound has changed - not sure if I like it yet but I had to do the job for
the MOT.

Question. As the exhaust type has changed should I re-time the engine to
compensate for changed back presure ?

Also. I've read the virtues of electronic ingnition in the archives &amp; on the
list. Anyone with experience of more than one type like to say which was
best ? Must be easy to fit/invisible (I'm keeping the bug stock
looking)/reliable and approriate for 1300 bug &amp; 1600 bus both with upright
engines as I want to treat both vehicles.

TIA

P.S. I always thought the D in DPO stood for Doppy
