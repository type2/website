Subject: Engine Numbers

Hi, can someone help me with these weird engine numbers? They aren't in the 
Muir book, and I've been through the archives. I kinda think I may have a 
type IV engine based on the camshaft I had to find...

Grrr... here I went and squished a pushrod tube when it dislodged during 
head torque...

Thanks much in advance.
