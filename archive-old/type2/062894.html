Christa and I have washed the curtains in our westy twice in as many 
years, with very good results.  It sounds like we have the same curtains 
as you, right down to the colour.

To answer your questions:
1) We machine washed using Woolite (tm) in cold water, and tumbled dry at 
   the lowest heat setting, adding Bounce (tm) for that &quot;Spring-fresh&quot; 
   (tm) scent.
2) We did not notice any shrinkage, but then we didn't do pre- and post-
   wash measurements either.
3) We did not notice any fading.  In fact, they were remarkably brighter 
   afterwards.  Apparently, there was a *lot* of dust and junk in them when 
   we started!

As a footnote, we did notice some very heavy fading of the fabric in a 
vertical &quot;stripe&quot; pattern, suggesting sun fading over the years where the 
folds from the curtain rods exposed/shaded the material from sunlight 
coming through the windows.

In my experience washing the curtains is safe and beneficial.

Just my CDN$0.02.
