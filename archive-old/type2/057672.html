Subject: RE: West dash panel replacement

&gt;I have a 1972 Westy... I have a 1987 Toyota Celica GTS...
&gt;The Toyota is available for parts. The Toy dash has all the 
&gt;gauges I wish my West had.
&gt;
&gt;Question: is it possible to make it work (using the Toy dash and 
&gt;gauges in place of the Vw's)??? 

I recently installed a set of gauges from a 79 Porsche 924 in my 73.
Worked out good and it is FULLY reversible if I ever want to re-install
my originals.  Cosmetically, it's not the best, but it's good enough for
me.

Here's the deal:  All gauges are matched to their senders.  Some are
close enough to be swapped, some aren't.  What I'd do is to take your
Toyota gauges over to you bus and start checking them one at a time.  

-- Speedo:  Make sure the speedo cable will fit.  If so, drive down the
road and back with the Celica speedo hooked up and see what your speed
differences are like.
-- Tach:  If your Celica was a 4 cyl and used points, the tach should
work - check it at the engine end of your bus - should be 3 or 4 wires
for it.  12v+ (red?), ground (black?), signal from neg side of coil
(usually green?), and another one for the light in it.
-- Oil pres:  You'll need to pull the pressure sender from the Celica's
engine.  If the threads are the same and the length of the threaded
portion is the same as the dummy light pressure switch on the bus, OK. 
-- Engine temp:  Took me a few days to realize, the engine temp on a 924
is WATER, not OIL.  Gauge works OK with my VDO oil temp sender, but
reads much lower than it should (by about half).  You might be able to
use the water temp sender in oil, I don't know.
-- Fuel gauge:  Each sender has its own range of ohms.  I got lucky with
the 924 gauge in that is is close enough to use (reads 7/8 full down to
below the red, but I can live with that).
-- Dummy lights:  No problem here.  12v lights are 12v lights.

I assume you know what the back of the bus gauge panel looks like?  Lots
of plastic molding back there that will have to be cut if you're
planning to use the original panel.  If you're not, you'll have to
figure out what you're gonna mount the new gauges in, taking into
consideration the curve of the bus dash and potential problems with
glare.  Oh yeah, don't forget about the heat/vent control levers.

Just make damned sure before you cut anything on your bus that
EVERYthing will work the way you envision it.  And if possible, do it in
such a way that you can change it back if you want.  I bought an old bus
gauge panel so I could cut it up and leave my original alone.  And any
wires that needed different connectors I pig-tailed adapters to the
original wires so I didn't even have to cut my bus's wiring harness.
