Subject: Re: [T2] 65 mph expectations and head question (loss of power)

&gt; My 71 speedo reads 10 mph high as compared to a GPS.
&gt; I think my passenger car tires are partly to blame.
&gt; When I push it to 65 my oil runs hot but I need to make some corrections to
&gt; my CR which was never set up properly.
&gt; I generally cruise between 55 and 60 with no problems but I don't have as
&gt; much weight at you.
&gt; 65 sounds like an optimistic expectation.

My 68 as well/ Around 10mph high at 55.
Summer trip driving 55-60 will be ok/
faster and the oil temps make me slow down.
