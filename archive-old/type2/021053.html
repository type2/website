&gt; Good points--I follow you--But for some reason --And we even put temperature gauges inside the
&gt; engine compartment. This &quot;Turbo&quot; effect works--as the air that is coming Up thru the gap appears
&gt; to give the inside more circulation--As long as this gap is as Far from the muffler system as
&gt; possible--But you have a good point, standing still,  you would be taking in Hot pavement
&gt; air----As Phoenix pavement in the summer will actually Blister your hand! This is no
&gt; joke--Pedistrians hit by cars in the summer in Phoenix do suffer some burns from the pavement.
&gt; The other test we did was air-scoops on the Splittie bus--Result--They Do cool the motor--TWWM,

&gt; &gt; If you have a doghouse oil cooler I wouldn't put your Turbo inlet near the
&gt; &gt; driver side cause that is where the cooler exhausts...  I also would watch
&gt; &gt; your temps while standing still with the heat off the exhaust of #2 and #3
&gt; &gt; going straight up and being sucked in by your fan...
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; What about on the highway, wouldn't the gap allow air to come in the
&gt; &gt; opposite direction of the scoops?  Would it make a dead spot in your engine
&gt; &gt; compartment?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Just idears....

&gt; &gt; Actually IF the gap is between the Fire wall and  the motor--Its  a good thing! as the air
&gt; &gt; that IS coming in to the engine compartment is Not the Hot exhaust air--Some people i know
&gt; &gt; actually create an opening there--It gives the air coming in a &quot;Turbo&quot; effect. I know many
&gt; &gt; will tell you to Seal the engine compartment the best you can  Which IS a good thing--But
&gt; &gt; from my experience with heat in Phoenix--
&gt; &gt; This &quot;Turbo&quot; air coming in--on the firewall side of the motor--really works--TWWM, uj
