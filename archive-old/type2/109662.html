Subject: Re: [T2] Oil Temps and Breather Boxes

Just an observation I've made while running a cyl. head temp. gauge and a
dip stick oil temp sender for a while.
You may already notice this but in general for me, the higher the engine RPM
the higher the oil temp. The lower the vacuum reading (that is pushing your
foot to the floor) the higher your head temp.
So for me if the heads get hot, I make sure I don't let the vacuum fall too
far, if the oil gets hot bring the revs down. Pretty simple but works every
time.
As for actual temps, there enough here already :-).
Cheers,
