&gt;Also, anyone up for caravaning? or meeting somewhere along the way?

        I plan to leave Northern Calif. (So. Oregon) between 17:00 and 21:00
on thursday (after work).  I plan to be passing through Sacramento between
8:00 and 12:00 friday morning, haveing slept somewhere between Lakehead and
Sac. depending on where I decide that I am tired.

        I normaly moniter CB 17 and 146.52 and have a license plate that
says KD6EVH (and I'm real slowwww(hey, its a diesel)), oh yeah I've got
about five antennas.  My wife says to say that it's tan and brown.

        Is there a planned CB ch or is 17 fine?  Anyone else on 2M?

        If anyone wants to caravan, let me know.
