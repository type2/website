Hey, you're in Colorado too .. go over to his place and take your own pictures. 
LOL

&gt;I've been considering butchering a FI kit together. The simplicity of
&gt;the FI in my 84 Volvo makes me want to do the same thing to my VW. And
&gt;the altitude changes are definitely a concern here (Highlands Ranch)!

I got ahold of a Bentley manual last week, and what I've learned reading from 
it has me thinking that the later Volvo FI (LH 2.4/3.0) would be much better 
to use than the 2.0/2.2 systems of the early '80s cars .. apparently the early
systems aren't truly closed-loop and still rely on a programmed fuel map,
but the 2.4/3.0 systems don't.  This directly contradicts what I *thought* I 
understood about LH based on the other books I've read, but I'm far more 
trusting of info from the Bentley manual than &quot;Tune &amp; Modify Bosch Injection&quot;
from HPBooks. :-)
