Subject: Re: [T2] Re: '78 Westy exhaust pipes??

Standard flex pipe has zinc plating on it---and it doesn't have much
long term durability--it rusts and then fails----this is the way it is.

It's not illegal when t's new---it's illegal after it blows a hole
through itself and you get direct drive exhaust prior to the muffler.

However, if anyone wants to use flex pipe--get the bullet proof good
stuff---stainless.

Cord, Duesenburg, Stutz, Benz, all used it--and it lasted for years.

As long as your talking about flex pipe---why not go for the gusto?

It doesn't cost any more to go first class..:&gt;)


E-mail message


Flexible exhaust pipe. Usually plated with something to retard the
rusting process.
also illegal in exhaust systems in many states.

Hey, I live in TN where we don't need stinkin' laws like that... &lt;VBG&gt;

Why would it be illegal per chance? (Seriously).
they can leak fairly easily
