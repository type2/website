Subject: Re: [T2] Bilge Blower from Home Depot?

Don, West Marine sells blowers that are 240cfm, in 3 and 4 inch diameters. 
(240cfm being the 4 inch one). They are online and you can find their 
closest store that way. The price was something like 24 dollars I believe.
HTH,
Courtney

&gt; Who was it that said they got the bilge blower from Home Depot? I
&gt; happened to be at Lowes yesterday and they had nothing. So before I go
&gt; looking at HD can you give me a name/part number?
