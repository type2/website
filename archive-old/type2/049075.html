Subject: Re: [T2] Insulation on and off the road

&gt; &gt; We use Wool (from sheep) insulation, same configuration as fibreglass but
&gt; &gt; without the health disadvantages, only costs 12% more. Smells wonderful,

In the studio we have used insulation made from recycled Blue
Jeans. Works good and no itchies. But still in a bus theres the moisture
consideration.
