On Wed, 20 Nov 96 Les Hall &lt;leshall_at_why_dot_net&gt; questioned his own reality
thusly:
&gt;1) Should I even bother? I can afford most of the repairs needed. Will I
&gt;get that much pleasure from my own graft?

you are making the Classic Mistake of assuming that you will have to be able
to do everything immediately. you don't learn to play a piano that way. you
don't learn to cook that way. why expect to learn auto repair that way?

do a little at a time. one task at a time. first, you learn to do an oil
change. do three or four of those, then learn to do a valve adjustment.
anything else that's needed, you take to someone else during this learning
period. by the end of a year, you should be able to to MOST of the routine
maintenance ... you will NOT be able to rebuild an engine or even remove
the engine, transmission, or starter, or stuff like that. that waits for
a little later. :)

start small. build confidence and familiarity. especially familiarity. find
someone else who has a bus and help them. watch them. get a group of bus
folks together for &quot;discussions&quot; on weekends, maybe a little group camping
and so forth. learning all by your lonesome is a hard thing to do. it's
much better with someone else, even if they are wrong sometimes (you'll
still learn something). :)

so my suggestion is to get the Muir book and start reading it. think of
the often-recurring things that need doing: oil change, air filter change,
spark plugs, fan belt adjustment/replacement, tire change, wiper blade
replacement, stuff like that. do ONE thing at a time. try to figure out
what AND why, but don't try to bite off a bit chomp at first. as you grow
more familiar, you gain confidence and experience.

&gt;2) If I am to enter this dark greasy world, what basic tools do I need?

again, the first tool you need is the Muir Idiot's Guide. the 2nd tool is
a Bentley manual for your bus. both are cheap. both are VERY useful.
next, you'll need some real tools, and Muir has a list of tools that you'll
need, broken down into several Phases (beginner, etc.). this is a good
guide to follow. Sears can provide some shortcuts in that they have &quot;kits&quot;
of tools you can buy with several of the things you'll need later (sockets,
screwdrivers, box-end and open-end wrenches, etc.).

a couple of things to think about:
- - don't buy cheap tools. imho, it's not worth it. buy the best tool you can
  afford, and try to hang onto it. do NOT lend tools or books (ol' Ben
  Franklin was right on that one! ;)  you'll want to get Metric tools.
- - get a good toolbox. do NOT get a big one that you will not be able to
  pick up (remember: this thing is gonna be FULL of heavy metal tools!).
- - get the tools for a job as you learn to do the job. or get one of the
  kits, but that means you'll need to see if you are really gonna NEED those
  tools later on (or are you just buying stuff that Sears wants to sell?).

&gt;3) What would be the first job I should attempt? I think my front wheel
&gt;bearings might be going out... When I corner at speeds over 20mph, I hear
&gt;a lower, sort of growly noise.

i'd let someone else do this for now. later, a year or so from now, you'd
be able to handle this, but right now, it's cheaper and quicker to pay
someone else to do it. which brings up an interesting question:
is it really cost effective to do your own work? or to pay a mechanic to
do it?

after 26 years of buying tools (and hauling them around in a bus) and
puttering on my buses, i'm of the opinion that it's almost even money on
either one. BUT! doing it yourself gives you a sense of confidence in the
bus and yourself that driving blindly onto the highway, even with a wallet
full of credit cards, cannot give. yes, it costs you a lot of time, both
in the learning process and in the performance of the work on the bus.
this is time you could be spending with wife and kids or on the golf course
or working overtime for more money, etc. but any classroom learning also
costs you time. and here, the bus is your classroom and YOU are the pupil
and the teacher. there is a lot of Zen in teaching yourself to work on
vw buses. :)

&gt;What have I let myself in for :)

nothing that hundreds, nay, thousands of others have not done before. :)
and if you can tie your own shoelaces, make your own sandwiches, and drive
a car in reverse for more than 100 feet, you can do it, too. ;)

but you need to start with the simple stuff, and work your way up. get the
Muir book and get started. he's not always exactly right, but he's a lot
better than nothing at all.

and don't forget: you've got nearly 500 people on this list to help you. :)
