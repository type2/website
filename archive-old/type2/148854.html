Subject: Les Schwab Brakes/Shocks...(not a tire question)

Well, as luck would have it my wife's Honda 02 Odessey's battery died in the
driveway today.  As more luck would have it, I was home with both kids (3.75
yr old boy and almost 1 year old girl) and I had a few errands to run.
 
Backed up the VW Bus, and tried using the jumpers to no avail.  Also tried
the not installed second battery too!  Nothing.
 
So, I loaded up kids and kid seats in the &quot;Daddy Bus&quot; and ran off to Les
Schwab and bought the top of the line battery (700 cold weather cranking
amps 850 normal... which is up from 550).  Plopped it in and it runs.  See
what happens when your kids leave all the lights on repeatedly over two
years will do to you!
 
Anyway, my question that came up while at Les Schwab is:
 
Have any of you taken your BUS to them for brakes, shocks and all (not
getting into tires....don't want to start that thread... I already know what
I am going to get and why....).  They say that they can do it, but they see
so many newer cars/SUVs that I am not sure they will know a 1978 VW Riviera
Bus.
 
I am getting ready for next week in pulling the engine/tranny to give it a
once over and work that over.  I do not want to totally tear it all apart.
