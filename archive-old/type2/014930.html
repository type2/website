Subject: Aftermarket Exhaust
Mime-Version: 1.0

Ahoy.  My first time posting here

&gt;Two; Try one more arrangement on the existing
&gt;arrangement. Wrap the ends of the heater boxes with a few turns of that
&gt;heat-setting exhaust tape, press the exhaust fittings over and torque
&gt;the hell out of a pair of American-style U-bolt clamps (either with or
&gt;without cutting a split in the exhaust flange).

This is what I did for my painfully non-standard dual exhaust ... no
problems in the last 2 months, minus the tape.  I might add the tape as
some insurance.  Does anybody have any experience with that stuff?

If you can fit 2 clamps on a joint, will that be twice as strong?   ;-)
