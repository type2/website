&gt; &gt; i couldn't use your link for that jack but what i use is an ATV jack from
&gt; &gt; harbor freight with a board on top, drops down to about 3 inches and works
&gt; &gt; quicker and safer than anything else i've ever used to pull an engine.
&gt; 
&gt; What about a transmission jack?  They lift high, lower low, and have
&gt; rollers.

yup exactly what I have done for a couple years now, use the Harbor
freight $89 special, will soon get the hyd version and blow the $250 on
it, (not getting any younger you know!) when I was young and foolish, well
ok younger,  I use to &quot;bench press&quot; the old 1300/1500 engines into them,
put the bus on blocks, lower engine onto chest and wiggle out from under
the van,  do the repairs and wiggle back under with engine on chest, and
then &quot;Bench press&quot; it back onto the tranny, but the T-IV engine is just a
weeee bit heavier  ;8*}
