Subject: Re: [T2] Propane Catalytic Heat - Drawback

Hi Markus,

I drove my 73 westy through the cold snowy winter of 99/00 using a catalytic
propane heater while driving. The condensation on the windshield was a
severe PITA. After a week or two there was a noticable coating of frost on
the seats, curtains, floor - it was iced up everywhere. On a dry day I'd
leave the doors open for a while; and a wet-dry vacuuming also helped clean
it up.

But it sure beat freezing to death. February in Toronto routinely sees
temperatures below zero farenheit, and I was working the midnight shift at
the time. Brrrrr! 

Happy trails,

Greg Potts

&gt; Hello All,
&gt; 
&gt; I've been following with interest the thread on extra heat in busses.  I'm
&gt; still working on my BN4.  I have a Coleman Black Cat catalytic heater I use
&gt; for camping and in the garage.  One day I was working inside my bus on a cold
&gt; day in the driveway without need to open the doors.  I decided to use the
&gt; catalytic heater to keep warm; it worked marginally, I thought (didn't get
&gt; very warm inside, but I wasn't in there for more than an hour).  A couple of
&gt; days later, I opened a steel toolbox with sliding drawers I keep in my bus
&gt; with hand tools in it.  I was less than thrilled to see all my tools were
&gt; covered with ice crystals and some droplets of water.  I've had the tools in
&gt; my bus for a couple of winters and never seen this before.  Of course I took
&gt; my tools inside and dried them.  From what I understand, a byproduct of the
&gt; combustion of propane is water vapor.  It seems to me that the water vapor I
&gt; released inside my bus condensed on my tools (and who knows what else inside;
&gt; inside doors, etc) as things cooled.  While the catalytic element makes the
&gt; combustion safe for us to breathe, the water is still there.  Has anyone else
&gt; seen condensation inside their bus from using one of these heaters?  I thought
&gt; I'd bring it up since it seems to me I've noticed several list members using
&gt; these heaters.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks,
