Subject: Leaking gearbox oil 

Hi

My gearbox, currently inside the bus, is leaking oil,  seems to be coming
from around the reversing (back up) light swicth.  I remember loosening this
some time ago because the reversing lights were on all the time.  So is my
switch duff or do I needs some kind of seal between the switch and the box.

Thanks
