Subject: AIRS Heads up.. Prescott to Phoenix

Hi Volks,
I'm heading up to Prescott Valley, AZ to buy a 73 Fastback. If I rescue 
it, then I'll be driving it home between 12 and 3 PM. If you should see 
a little Fastback along I-17 honk, wave or help depending on if I'm 
driving, smoking from the Fasty, or broken down.

I can't access the map _at_ the site to find anyone. My browser won't show 
it on my cell phone. I'll send another note here if I need help, or a 
follow-up posting of my trip home.

Thanks in advance.
Timothy
