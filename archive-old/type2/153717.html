Subject: [T2] timing scale


&gt; any word on the timing scale that german supply mentioned they would have
&gt; about a month ago?   i need one badly and was wondering how to measure
&gt; where
&gt; the zero should be on the pully.  how many centimeters or inches would it
&gt; be
&gt; to the left of the timing knoch presuming the knotch is at twelve o'clock.
&gt; any tips on finding where the zero would be.   could someone tell me how
&gt; to
&gt; measure with a protractor or something to mark all of the places i need
&gt; like
&gt; the zero, 7.5btdc and so forth

As near as I can measure the pulley for an air-cooled Vanagon, the rim of
the pulley is 24.5 inches.  So each sixteenth of an inch away from the notch
in the pulley would be 0.918 degrees.  Ergo,  7.5 degrees would be a half
inch away from the notch or 13 millimeters.  The notch would be zero in this
case.

I've never tried to time a TypeIV engine without a timing scale so I'm just
sort of guessing about how I'd go about it.  First, I'd mark the pulley
itself with the timing point I'm interested in by measuring right or left
from the notch.  Then, I'd move the engine to TDC on the compression stroke.
I think I'd try to rig up some sort of pointer - maybe a piece of wire taped
to the fan shroud or something - that would point right to the notch with
its end only a fraction of an inch away from the pulley.  Maybe even put a
spot of white paint on the end of the pointer so it would show up easily
with the flash of the timing gun.  (With the wire and the pulley aligned
with the engine at TDC the notch is now zero degrees.)  From there the
timing process would be &quot;the usual&quot; except you'd be done when the pointer
and your new timing mark on the pulley were aligned.
