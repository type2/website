Subject: vacuum canister

Hey,

I've got a fairly new '73, 1700 type IV in my bus. It runs the vacuum/retard
distributor (two nipples), Pertronix, and It has dual Weber 34 ICT's. Up to
this point I've had no problems and I even passed my exhaust emission test
not to long ago. My problem now is that when I'm transitioning from driving
to idling, (coming to a stop) it wants to stall so I give it a little gas
and it's OK - it will idle, though I'm not having fun two footing it though.
It does this hot or cold. I've checked for vacuum leaks even though I
replaced all my hoses about 4 months ago, but didn't find anything. I did
notice two things, however: first - that one of my webers seems to be
leaking a little gas from the throttle shaft  - and second, that when I suck
on my vacuum advance hose and watch the spring plate inside the distributor,
the plate moves but it doesn't stay advanced - it moves back even though I
keep sucking on the hose. Is it suppose to do this or is this can toast? Are
these two items the cause of my stall or should I be looking for something
else? Finally, who's good to go to for rebuild kits for Weber ICT's? Lots of
questions - but thanks in advance.
