Subject: Re: [T2] Oil temperature sender conversion?

Where are you planning on using the Tee fitting to mount the sender?
Planning to use the same location as your pressure sender? Not a good idea.
While on your Type1 engine the location is close to the block using the Tee
moves it out an inch or two and will show the tems a bit low. On a Type4
one has to use &quot;relocation hose&quot; because of the tinwork and the temps shown
would be WAY off.

If you want to use a non-dipstick sender it should be mounted directly in
the oil flow path. I THINK there are methods to mount the sender in one of
your pressure relief plug ports for the Type1 or down on your sump plate.
For the Type4 the taco plate is the best location.

Hopefully others will chime in with suggestions for Type1 mounting, I've
been digging for info on Type4 gauges lately and my Type1 info is lacking.

Yes, the other senders can be used with the same gauge and wiring.
