Ok guys,
I need some serious first hand advice on this one.
I'm trying to install a 6volt BN2 heater in a 12volt.
&gt;From searching the archives and the web it appears that a voltage reducer
would be a roll of the dice at best.  I'd probably need three separate
units, one for the glow plug, one for the fuel pump, and one for the fan.
I read on the aircooled junkyard web site that one option might be to wire
two 6 volt batteries in series, wiring the 6 volt heater inbetween the two,
then the rest of the vehicle after the second battery.
Has anyone actually done this?  Is it just a theory?
Anyone have a different method that they've actually installed?
I read lots of theory today but would like to talk to someone who has a
working model.
Thanks a bunch
