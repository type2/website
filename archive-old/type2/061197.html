Subject: Crew Cab for Sale 

Howdy all. After much thought, common sense has dictated that I not add another
vehicle to my fleet, and so a '67 crew cab must go to a good home. This is a
bus that I recently acquired through a long and adventurous trade. While I'm
not intimately familiar with the bus, I have driven it, and can vouch for its
present condition.
It is running, quite well actually, and starts easily.
Fairly recent brakework
Brand new battery
straight nose and body
perfect roof and windshield sills
but the lower body is kinda rusty. It would be fine as a work truck, or daily
driver, but it needs rockers and cab floors to be restored. Gates are also
rather rusty.

Pictures can be viewed at

There are interior and exterior shots, as well as shots of the worst rust
areas.
Anyway, the bus is in Raleigh, NC, and would be drivable home...
Please e-mail me for more information.
Thanks,
