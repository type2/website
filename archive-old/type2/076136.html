&gt; Normally cows only inhabit a fairgrounds for about five days per year, it

Excellent point from Ken.  The real test is... &quot;Did you smell ammonia?&quot;
If so, I would say that a different storage place would be better, but if
not, then you are fine.  The human nose is amazingly sensitive to
ammonia....  Ask anyone who eats a lot of asparagus :-)
