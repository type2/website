I want to thank everyone on this list for all the great info. I have to leave you all for a while, due to the fact that I am selling my computer. My wife thinks that I am sick, (she says that I am a VW addict) due to the fact that I am selling the computer, so that I can purchase yet another bus!!! It is a beautiful 1962 camper version, in need of restoration!! Maybe we'll meet down the line......
