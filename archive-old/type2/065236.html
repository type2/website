Subject: ? 82 FI Temp Sensor II Removal

Hi All,

I have been working on an 82 Vanagon, non-CA AFC FI sustem and located
(hopefully) the culprit of its FI woes:  The Tempature Sensor II as
Bentley's calls it, located alongside the #3 intake.  It had epoxy *all*
over it and once I got to the connection, there was no ohm reading.  I
stuck a 6-pointed 1/2&quot; socket over the epoxied senor and got it
off--cleanly even with the cooling sheetmetal!  

My question is:  How is this item attached to the head or sheet metal?  I
looked in the archives, but did not find anything specific, so please
don't steer me that direction.  8-)  Does it attach to the cooling tin
somehow, or must I remove the cooling tin and get to the head somehow?
I'd be much happier working on a solex 28'd 36hp motor!!!!   This is all
very new to me.  Bentley's does not show me the detail of how the
sensor is installed and my curiousity cannot wait until the new sensor 
comes in.  TIA,
