&gt; &gt;We're contemplating converting our new '72 Bus into a camper.  We have

&gt; &gt;not be that difficult, but what about the pop top?  I obviously will
&gt; have
&gt; &gt;to hack out a gaping hole in the roof of our '72, but are there any
&gt; &gt;reinforcements needed?  Did they reinforce the bodies or frames at all
&gt; when
&gt; &gt;making the Westies?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;I'm also assuming that a '75 pop top (hinge in the back) will fit a '72
&gt; &gt;Bus, which would have had a front hinging top.  Is that correct?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Has anyone out there done this sort of conversion before?  Any tips or
&gt; &gt;suggestions?
&gt;
I feel that I must speak out in defense of poptops. I put a '75 top on my '67
bus and it's one of the best things I've ever done to the bus. I didn't have
any troubles with the back hatch as someone mentioned. the only thing to do is
make sure to weld in a good subframe to replace the roof frame you remove. I
took a weekend and did it, although I am lucky enough to have access to welding
equipment, and a good friend who knows how to use it.
Basically, cut out the roof, and the middle cross brace. Weld in the new frame,
attach the bed, and top, and you're all set!
I highly recommend it, and have thoroughly enjoyed mine for the last 2 years.
