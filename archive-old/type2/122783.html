Subject: door sealant warning

My Genuine German seals came today.  They fit nicely.

Someone along the way tried to get the Brazilian seals to fit by using 
a VERY large quantity of the black (probably) 3M sealant.  So much, in 
fact, that the new seals had a hard time going in.  I spent well over 
an hour scraping and still have not removed the giant globs of this 
stuff.  Not only was it a pain in the butt, but the black globs had 
trapped quite a lot of moisture.

Don't do this to your bus!  If you don't plan on keeping the bus, don't 
subject a future owner to this torment.  I have not removed all of the 
gunk to my satisfaction.  If anyone has some hints, please forward them.

I also replaced my tail light and turn signal lenses with the new 
Brazilian dark lenses.  I realize this modification will probably add 
like 60 HP to the bus...  They do look cool though.
