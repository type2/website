Subject: Re: [T2] Tire Question for Canadians

&gt; I was at Costco tonight and it was a disaster.

Costco's policy (at least at the one I was at) is to only 
fit original spec tires. They will flat out refuse to mount 
anything bigger or smaller than stock.

&gt;Any word on canadiantire, or wally world??

I haven't tried Wal-Mart but I got my Agilis 215/65-15 51's 
at Canadian Tire. The price was REALLY competitive, to the 
point that I decided to buy TWO spares... then proceeded to 
spend all of the savings to buy a sixth 15&quot; rim.

Don't be put off by the fact that I have 15&quot; wheels and you 
are looking for 14&quot; wheels. Canadian Tire will now special 
order tires for you so even if they don't have ot chances 
are they can get it. There is some pretty good tire 
information at:

Thanks,
Chris
