Subject: RE: [T2] Yank fuel injectors for dual carbs? Worth it?

Hi Nik

This is one of the biggest problems out there when people do not understand
FI.
The first thing out of there mouth is throw the baby out with the bath
water!
FI will be more reliable then carbs could ever be.
Your in the Cascades, FI will run circles around Carbs in the moutons.
Rejetting for high elevation will set you up to lean on the flat land (Bad
News!), and setting them up for flat land when you hit _at_8000+ feet and your
belching back smoke at best!   BTDT.
With the money you'll spend on taking out the FI and putting in Carbs, would
have put your FI in Tip Top shape! and probable for less.
I'm still running dual 44 Webers on my 72 Rivera and I'm planning on taking
them off when I find the parts and money to do it right.
If you do put carbs on, and used ones to boot! inspect them vary closely
there are a lot of worn-out carbs out there that will only be a PITA.

FI = better MPG and HP

Doug...

Greetings T29ers, Disclaimer: I9m still a newbie VW driver/mechanic, and I
only know about the stuff I9ve had to repair so far...My buddy claims this
(carb x 2) will help my T2 engine run cooler, give more HP and better
mileage?  I priced some carbs and ouch! Not a cheap or simple operation,
when you add up the costs of carbs, fuel pump etc.  I would enjoy some more
HP as I live in the foothills of the Cascades and I sometimes wonder if I9ll
make it over these passes.  What about rebuilt carbs, they seem more within
my budget?  Why would VW change over to FI if it isn9t as efficient?  Less
pollution maybe?  Thanks for putting up with me.

Cheers, Nik
