Hi folks, and happy spring to everyone in the northern hemisphere,
   I've got the camping interior out of our 71 westy to repalce the wood and 
linoleum floor.  No doubt about it, this is going to snowball into more than 
just a floor, but that's OK.  Once there is a new floor and new wood on the 
lower part of the walls, I'd hate to put the cabinets back in the way they 
are.  The formica on them is chipped, cracked, and broken.  I sure would 
like to repair or replace the formica, but don't have a clue to working with 
that kind of stuff.
   Can anyone recommend a book, web site, or other refrence for working with 
laminates like that?   First hand advice would be great too.
Thanks in advance for the help.
