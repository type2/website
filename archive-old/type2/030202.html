&gt; Over the weekend, I tried to check the thermostat adjustment, but I found
&gt; that there was no thermostat and no connecting link rod.  So now I wonder if
&gt; a) the flaps are in place and b) if present, are they open?  Is there any
&gt; way to check these things without pulling a whole lot 'o stuff apart?

Feel around the front of the fan shroud near its base.  If the flaps are
present the flap levers (2 on each side) should be there.
