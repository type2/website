Subject: Re: [T2] Oil Regulator gaskets

BUS DEPOT.

Been good to me.

A local solution might be NAPA.

&gt;Where could I find gaskets for the oil regulator and relief valve screws? 
&gt;I have 1600 engine rebuilt
&gt;3000 miles (14 months) ago. It is leaking from those two locations (big 
&gt;screws under the engine
&gt;at the front and back ), unless it is leaking at the two block halves 
&gt;joint. There is also a lot of oil
&gt;residue on the &quot;moustache&quot;bar at the back. Any ideas where the leak might be?
