Subject: VW 3 : Locksmith 1

A tale of the formidable opponent that the bus is against a well 
equipped lockmithing foe.
A friend locked her keys inside her '78 VW Westi.
I stayed around to watch the show.
  
Round 1 - 
A locksmith came out and in the first round attempted 
to gain entrance through a wing window using a special tool that 
looked like an ice pick that had been run through blender.  It had 
lots of bends and angles that allowed it to be fed between the glass 
and rubber to engage the catch on the wing handle and then rotate the 
handle to open the wing.  Tool broke.
Score after the first round.  VW 1 : Locksmith 0
Round 2 -
Locksmith proceeded to try again with a another similar tool. See 
round one for the action.
Score after the second round.  VW 2 : Locksmith 0
Round 3 -
Locksmith proceeded to attempt to pick lock on driver's door.  After 
about 15 minutes of valiant effort, the locksmith finally gave up and 
asked what window he could break.
Score after the third round.  VW 3 : Locksmith 0
Round 4 -
I told him that all of the locks on the bus have considerable 
resistance to turning, except the rear hatch. We went to the aft end 
and proceeded to attempt the entry.  Considerably exhausted, or was 
that disgusted, he tried in vain to pick the lock.  With assistance 
from the author (doing the rotate thing) while he did the raking 
thing we finally managed to unlock the hatch.
Final score.  VW 3: Locksmith 1

Lessons learned:
1 - Keep a hide-a-key somewhere.
2 - If you MUST have  locksmith pick their way into a bus, go 
straight to the end of the line, or aft of the bus anyway.
