Subject: More Engine temp

Happy Weekend, Listees!

I have recently installed guages in my 74 bus and I'm concerned about one of
the readings. Here's the story: 74 Day Camper, 1800 Built by AVP on an FI
case, 20,000 miles,Weber dfev carb, electric fuel pump, SVDA distributor,
all tin present and in good condition. The bus runs strong, starts instantly
when cranked, and has as much power as one may expect. I'm running 20/50
Kendall dino oil with the correct Mahle filter. weather these days is
mid-90's and very humid.

At speeds of 55-60 mph I get readings of ~35 psi oil pressure, 200-210F oil
temp, and 400+F head temps. The oil pressure and temp I am pleased with but
the head temp has me worried a bit. (VDO guage with the sender under the #3
spark plug.)
Is this a temp I should be worried about? Could it be a guage-specific
anomoly, ie, my guage just reads high? Or, could it indicated a lean fuel
mix at high speed? Additionally, is there a good backyard method to test the
guage reading?

As always, facts, experience, opinions and wild conjecture gratefully
accepted.

Thanks in advance,
Dave, who lives out in the country where every bug is your neighbor.
