Subject: GRRRR! Clutch : Parts for sale in MT

Has anyone ever pushed the clutch and got groweled at?  Here's the deal,
68 bus, new clutch (50 miles or so), new throw out bearing, good trans
etc.  I push in the clutch, in neutral or gear and get a growl.  I can
push it 3/4 of the way and get no growl and still shift, but this can't
be good.  Yanked the engine today, looked at the pressure plate, where
those three metal clips, or supports are and saw one off. Yay, put it
back on and throw the engine back in.  GRRRR, she didn't stop growling. 
I fixed nothing!! 3 hours in the cold and I got nowhere. Am I hurting
anything pushing the clutch only 3/4? Do I need to grease something or
is something bad?  Any info would be appreciated.

BTW, add in paper (great falls mt)&quot;FOR SALE: 1956 VW bug,
Proffessionally refinished and painted, needs assembly, 3 VW Bugs for
parts (1956 and 2 1957's) Misc. 1960's van and bug parts and access.
Come see and make an offer (406)453-2993.&quot;  I called and he is wanting
to sell the whole kit and caboodle for around $10,000. Considering
selling individual parts.

Thanks, Tim
