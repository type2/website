Subject: Front bra for 71 Westy?

Anyone know where I can find a good one? Could;t find one on Bus Depot
website.

I also have new 71 seat covers (Beige) with Horse Hair pads for trade here or
make me an offer... I had to swap out the seat material as my wife was
allergic to the pads... had them redone with foam... TMI brand....

Trey
