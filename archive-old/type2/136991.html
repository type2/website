Subject: Meditation on bus ownership

Everyone on this list has their own reasons for owning a bus, and their 
own approach to it. This is mine, refined by six years of ups and 
downs.

1. I'm a monogamous bus owner. When I bought Peregrine for $440, I did 
it for life. This is not logical, but it's my disposition. Barring a 
fire (which I am going to do everything to prevent), theft, or a severe 
accident, the keys to this bus are going to be in the pocket of my 
jeans the day I die. (I just hope that isn't made easier by happening 
anytime soon.) Logically, it would make much more sense to just get 
another bus, a smog-exempt '75 maybe. But 'till death do we part.

2. I've had it up to here (points to chin) with downtime. I'm building 
a basically bullet-proof bottom end, and thinking about the next one 
(and hoping it's a long way down the road). Once this engine is in, I 
don't want to be deterred from driving for more than a week at a time, 
ever again. VW buses are for driving (and some are for camping). Yes, 
they also make great hobbies, but I've got other hobbies.

What that means, in reference to the other thread, is that there's  _no 
way_ that I am going to garage Peregrine for a month, or six months, or 
a couple of years while I weld body panels, fill, prime, glide coat, 
sand, glide coat, sand, glide coat, sand, prime again, and paint. I 
know that seems like the right way to go if you don't mind not having a 
bus to drive. But like I said, a week is about all I'm ever going to 
put up with again. And preparing to paint this way takes time.

I realize that there is something awesome about getting a complete 
body-and-paint make-over. One day your bus looks like hell, or just  
sort of sad, and a month or two later it's shiny and straight. But if I 
went that route it wouldn't be a month or two. It would be a year or 
two. I'll bet other people have the same experience.

3. A bus is not inherently undependable as many people think they are. 
It's quite the reverse. Properly maintained and driven, there is no 
reason a bus should break down. Ever. The trick is to get a bus to that 
state of tune and keep it there. That's what is most important ...

4.  ... to me.
