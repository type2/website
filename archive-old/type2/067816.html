Subject: Re:  parts place----NOPI

i have had a couple of good experiences with NOPI.  the prices have always
been great, and there is one in town, which makes getting things like
points really convenient.

in one instance, i ordered a jet for my weber progressive, and they sent
the wrong one, which they then gave to me.  i drove around with it for a
couple of months, then _finally_ returned it.  they took it back and got
me the new one, no problems (even though this violates their return
policy).  they even paid shipping both ways for the replacement.
