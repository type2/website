&gt;Subject: Disconnecting the air bag on a Saturn (non-VW)

&gt;&gt;A friend (4'10&quot;, female) asked me tonight whether I 
&gt;&gt;could do her the favor of disconnecting the air bag on 
&gt;&gt;her new Saturn. She is quite concerned about some 
&gt;&gt;stories she has heard about deaths caused by short 
&gt;&gt;people being too close as the air bag inflates and being 
&gt;&gt;killed by the inflating bag.                           H Steven Dolan

Be careful. My brother's shop got a safety notice. Some guy was
messing with stering column wiring while laying on the seat. The airbag
went off, and broke his neck, killing him. My brother's mechanics
have set off a few while probing wires from under the steeering column.
No injuries, just a big bang, and no profit that day. 
IF YOU ARE GOING TO MESS WITH AIRBAG WIRING DO SO FROM A POSITION THAT
AN EXPLODING AIRBAG CAN NOT HURT YOU.
