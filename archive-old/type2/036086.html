Subject: Re: Removing type 4 engine, limited headroom

&gt;The recent talk about manhandling engines has reminded me of a question I
&gt;wanted to ask.  While I can see that it is much easier to remove an engine
&gt;if the bus is jacked up, has anyone ever done it without jacking?
&gt;
&gt;The reason I ask is that I don't like to leave my bus in the street (things
&gt;go missing) and if I took the engine out in the street I probably wouldn't
&gt;be able to get the bus back into the garage.  But... there is not enough
&gt;headroom in the garage to jack up the bus (apart from the couple of inches
&gt;you get when you relieve the back end of all that weight).
&gt;
&gt;So - remove everything above the level of the fan housing, and the rear
&gt;bumper, drag out on greased board or whatever - can it be done?  If no one
&gt;knows, I will have to get a tape measure out and guess.
&gt;
&gt;Wish I could afford to build a new garage ...


Many times I have removed an engine (just 3 day's ago a '76) and then let
the bus down on all 4's and moved it back beside the barn.

It is easy to raise the bus, put it on jack stands (4 of them), remove the
engine (MUCH easier lifted in the air), lower the bus, push it where you
want it.  You should have the entire procedure done in less than an hour (2
if you have a friend helping you).
