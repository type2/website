in the meantime, if you need to disable it, it's trivial and Muir 
documents
it well.  Basically, you just loosen the screws and twist it (clockwise, 
IIRC)
until the butterfly valve is &quot;stuck&quot; open, then tighten the screws down 
again.
   This is a good trick to know in a pinch, and, remembering to check your
choke is another one for the checklist.

(I usually remember that one when I'm behind the bus and staring at my 
engine)
