&gt;I tightened the afforementioned bolts less than four months ago.  I

Loctite (blue).  Never had a problem with them coming loose.  I second the
advice of making sure you have the proper washers - that's probably very
important although I haven't tried it without.

&gt;If you haven't checked yours, you might want to.  I just glad I wasn't
&gt;cruising down the interstate when this happened.  Another question, how
&gt;can you determine/change which wheel the transaxle delivers power to?

It's dependent upon the resistance of each wheel.  Generally it will
deliver to the right wheel because of the direction of engine torque, but
if the left wheel is on a slippery surface it will spin.  Of course, this
is how the differential is supposed to work.  When both wheels are firmly
attached to pavement, the power will be delivered to both wheels equally.

One more thing, despite what others have said, I have successfully used a
6mm allen wrench to remove/install the 12 point bolts.  It will work if a)
the bolts are in good condition, b) the allen wrench is in good condition,
c) the allen wrench is inserted all the way into the head of the bolt, and
d) the bolt hasn't been overtorqued/rusted on.  I usually take a small
screwdriver and scrape out all of the gunk that accumulates in the head of
the bolt, then spray it out with carb cleaner.  If you pay attention to c)
especially you should have no trouble.
