Subject: Painting wheels

Nicely painted wheels help your bus look great but do
not forget one major function of the wheel/paint
thing: to seal the bead and hold air in the tire!
Painting just the outside will &quot;look&quot; great but if the
bead sealing area on the rim is just as rusty as the
visible areas you may have problems with the tires
going flat. Great looking wheels with flat tires....
not the way to go. Now tire installers do have &quot;goop&quot;
to seal tire beads to problem rims but I don't really
like the stuff. 

There are two tricks to painting wheels and avoiding
this problem:

1. have the tires removed from the rims and have the
area you don't see painted as well as the areas you do
see.

2. Find a tire shop that has a rim machine that
reaches around the tire and does not touch the outer
area of the rim. These machines are much more common
today and will not damage the paint. Better yet have
someone mount them by hand. I did this once myself
(new tires, fresh painted wheels) and can do a tire in
less then 4 minutes.
