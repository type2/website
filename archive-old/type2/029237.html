Just stumbled on this during a search on the web.
http://www.ismi_dot_net/riecherttuning/typeiv.htm This company has many
intriguing but EXPENSIVE products. A complete stainless steel exhaust with
heat exchangers for $872 (plus shipping from Germany!)

Also brand new German TypeIV heads and blocks. They say they bought the
whole stock of VW after they stopped producing them.
A corvair style shroud and fan kit.
A complete engine with no pricing, if you have to ask you can't afford it :
-)

This all way to rich for my blood but maybe some listees are making their
Xmas lists :-)
