Subject: 73 mystery westy

My interest in the year is a date of birth deal. I have always wanted a 
westy since I was about 6. My mom owned a convert of unknown year. The 
condition seems pretty bad but the body has little visible rust along wheel 
wells and the interior is all there down to the stock curtains. Paint isn't 
to oxidized and the motor is complete. So for $600 to save it and make it my 
own vs. letting it sit until it rots or they send it off to the junkyard 
it's well worth it. Plus when I saw him he talked to me. This is my bus, 
know what I mean? My other interest is so that I can find out the benefits 
for this particular year, i.e. one year only things. Everybody has been so 
cool to give me all this information, I really appreciate it.
