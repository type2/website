&gt; Hello all,
&gt;  
&gt; I think I'm going to name my 81 Vanagon &quot;The Pain that Never Ends.&quot;
&gt;  
&gt; Got it back from the shop a week ago.  Engine was rebuilt and running strong.  Automatic tranny shifting real smooth.
&gt;  
&gt; I've got a problem that's getting worse.
&gt;  
&gt; Originally, it would stall intermittingly at traffic lights and stop signs, if I kept it in drive.  If I shifted into neutral, it kept running.  Most of the time, it was fine.  I figured it was water in the gas or something that would work itself out with time.  I put in a bottle of &quot;dry gas&quot;.
&gt;  
&gt; But instead of getting better, it got worse.
&gt;  
&gt; Then it started to stall at almost all stops.  Putting it in neutral didn't always save it.  Most of the time it would start right back up, but not always, which made for some interesting traffic patterns...if I waited a minute or two, it would start back up.
&gt;  
&gt; Today it started stalling while coasting at speeds lower than 25 mph.  I'm scared to drive it anywhere....
&gt;  
&gt; I swapped out the fuel filter, thinking it might be a clogged fuel filter.  The vehicle did sit for a year while I was working on it.  It's got a brand new fuel pump.
&gt;  
&gt; I tightened up the alternator belt.  That seemed to help, for a while.
&gt;  
&gt; I thought it might be a vacuum leak, but I'll be damned if I can find one.
&gt;  
&gt; Any suggestions?   I've put so much time and money and blood into this thing...
&gt;  
&gt; Thanks for your time.
&gt;  
&gt; Marc

I think your hunch of a vacuum leak is the best first place to look.
I had one in the &quot;Y&quot; connector off the plenum underneath a hose clamp. 
The PO put clamps on it to keep it tight but over time with vibration 
the clamp cut into the rubber.  Loosen any clamps and check under them.

Next I'd check the resistor on the front wall of the engine compartment.
I bought my '80 after the PO had replaced the engine.  It had been 
slowly developing a similar behavior.  After checking a number of things 
I found that a couple of the wires on the ceramic resistor at the end of 
the wire harness were broken.  This probably occurred when his mechanic 
reinstalled the motor and bumped it.  It sits on the upper left (facing 
forward looking into the engine compartment) of the front wall of the 
engine compartment.  Without proper resistance the computer can't manage.

Hope this helps.
