Subject: Re: [T2] engine oil additive problems coming? ?

Hi David

none of those words are actually mine,, I copied that stuff from other
websites,, who have done the same.. so ... I guess the point I was getting
at,,, as I have noticed that my brands of 20W50 have been impossible to get
over the summer,,  is OIL actually changing,,, and apparently,, not for the
better with aircooled in mind.

&gt; I was with you until you said this.  I have a large group of friends
&gt; that have experienced a statistically-unlikely engine failure rate when
&gt; using Royal Purple.  My engine builder, who has been building race
&gt; engines for 35 years also will not touch it.  Their bearing wear
&gt; demonstration is impressive but in the real world I don't think their
&gt; oils perform as claimed.  YMMV, DYODD etc. but the inside of MY engines
&gt; will never see purple oil.
