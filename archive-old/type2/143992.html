Subject: ice box for your bus

I found a great antique metal ice box a few days ago. I thought someone might like to install it in a bus for a really unique touch. This is the kind that people used to use with a big block of ice that was delivered to their house. It could drain out like a bus sink does. It looks like a small fridge. Not really too heavy either. It would be about the same weight as the sink/cooler that fits behind the passenger sear in my old 71, but taller. The legs could be removed if you wanted it to be shorter. If anyone is interested in the Western NC, contact me for exact dimensions. I could bring it to High Country if needed. It was appraised by an antique dealer at $65-125. I'll let it go for $55.
