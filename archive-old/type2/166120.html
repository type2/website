A good friend, of a friend had a mint '64 Doublecab that was just
'totaled'
  by some idiot in a Saturn Vue who said she &quot;just looked away for a
  second&quot;
  plowing into the back of him at 55mph, as he was turning into work.

  He wasn't hurt too badly (mostly just sore), thank God! My biggest
  fear when
  driving our old '68 Doublecab was getting hit in the front....as you
  can well imagine  ;-o

  Anyway. he just got the insurance buy-back and would rather part
  this out to someone who is interested.

  I have photos, and the friend's contact information.

  Please P-Mail me if you are interested.

  I just hate to see one of these go to the scrap yard!
