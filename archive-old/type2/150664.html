&amp;gt; Easier on a DIY scale would be etching.  If you're at all serious, get
&amp;gt; yourself down to Michaels Arts &amp;amp; Crafts and look at the glass etching
&amp;gt; kits &amp;amp; supplies they have there.  Goes on with a brush, cleans up with
&amp;gt; water, and they've even got stuff for masking and making designs and
&amp;gt; patterns.

I shudder at the way that they sell this stuff.  The active ingredient is
hydrofloric acid, which is so nasty that it even eats glass (which is why
it is used for this!)  If it gets on your skin it is very difficult to
remove, which has resulted in amputations.

We are not allowed to have hydrofloric acid in our high school chemistry
storeroom because of the dangers.

Not saying that it can't be used safely, but be sure to wear _good_
nitrile gloves and eye protection.  Be sure to keep the stuff off of
anything you don't want etched or ruined.  Masking everything below the
window is highly recommended.
