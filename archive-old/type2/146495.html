Subject: gas leak

I have a '72 dual carb.  This evening I came home from work and found my
garage to be smelling pretty heavily of gas.  There's a puddle under the
right side of my bus and a small drip under the left side.  It's a slow
drip.  It's not at the pump, I checked that, but it's the right carb - it's
very wet.  Is the pump still sending gas up to the carbs when the van is
turned off?  I just had the carbs rebuilt but not tuned.  I haven't driven
the bus this winter but I did start it up the other day.  I'm learning as I
go and have been off the type2 for a while.  Any thoughts?
