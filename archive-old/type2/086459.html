&gt;had a similar problem with a '70 Bug.  Rather than having to switch out
the pressure-plate, I went late-model by adding the bearing guide-sleeve =
to
the transmission.

I think this is the way to go.  Has anybody done this before?  Can I just=
 change out the fork, T/O bearing, and clips?  I would hate to get rid of=
 a brand new pressure plate.  Tell me more.......
