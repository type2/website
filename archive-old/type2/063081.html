Subject: Elusive oil levels

Mark,

&gt;I go out in the morning and check the oil before
&gt;starting the bus. It reads a quarter inch over the full mark. I wipe it off
&gt;with a rag and reinsert it into the engine. All the way into the engine.
&gt;Then I immediately pull it out. The oil level is now at the add mark. This
&gt;situation has caused me to consistently overfill the oil because I have been
&gt;trusting the reading I get when...

Yours is a mysterious case.

Ok, here's what you do.  You drain it.  You then fill it to specified
capacity with new oil.  Idle the engine long enough to fill the filter.
You let it sit over night.  You take out the dipsitck, wipe it, put it in
and measure what's in there.  This is now your &quot;full&quot; mark.  Add a little
oil when it gets 1/4&quot; below this.  Always check it the same way.  Don't go
over this mark.  You won't blow any oil seals.

Is it possible that the guide tube for the dipstick is flakey?

Best,
