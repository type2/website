Subject: Re: [T2] The Physics of Cooling

Just adding my observations from the CHT, OT, OP gauges I have on my '77
Dual carb type 4 (2L)
I can regulate either temperature independently with how I drive. I have
noticed CHT increases with low vacuum (foot to the floor driving), and OT
increases with high revs.
So if you pick a long steady hill, drive up in a tall gear so you have low
revs and a low vacuum reading, CHT will increase and OT should remain
stable.
Alternatively drive in a low gear, so you have high revs but keep the vacuum
~10&quot; or higher. CHT should remain constant but OT will increase.
Happy busin'.
Regards,
Richard
