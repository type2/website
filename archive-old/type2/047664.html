Subject: [T2] LPG conversions

LPG as fuel for cars has been and still is quite popular in several European
countries. Conversions of older buses is still possible. However in Holland
new safety regulations make it more expensive now then it used to be. Back
in the old days many buses ran on LPG. The biggest problem was where to put
the tank. Sometimes people would put one on some sort of roof rack. This was
in my opinion not a very appealing sight.
