&gt;My question is this: is there supposed to be a rubber grommet that fits

&gt;I think there IS supposed to be a gromet and I wasn't
&gt;able to find one from VW, RMMW, West Coast Metric, etc. I'll
&gt;check my parts book.

Yes There is supposed to be a grommet on both ends of that refill line, plus one on the outside of
the line where it passes through the seat pedestal. RMMW has grommets listed for a ghia, which
I bought and are close - It will work for the one on top (refill tank to line) but on the bottom where it
meets the MC res is the important connection.  Don't try to find used ones as they're probably shot.
I would go to the 'help' section of your FLAPS, pick up a hard plastic connector fitting -they're black
plastic and come in red packaging. I then cut it down to fit nicely between the resevoir line (new from
RMMW) and the MC res plastic fitting. Use hose clamps to keep it tight. It worked for me with no leaks.
