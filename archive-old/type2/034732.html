Greetings -

I have a Uniden handheld that has worked nicely over the past 6 years. It
came with an external antenna and cigarette lighter plug so you can get
better reception on the road. I think it's a model 310 (it's at home - I'm
not), but they should have a newer model out now. It was $120 back then, so
I'm sure they're probably cheaper now too.

&gt; Has anyone on the list researched a good portable CB Radio solution for
the
&gt; camper?
