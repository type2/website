&gt;Can anyone help me? I've got a 1970 bus with: 1776 engine, 040 twin

&gt;So two questions:
&gt;1. Is this out of the ordinary for a stock cam to go out with my engine
&gt;configuration at every 18,000 miles?

My guess is that the heads they gave you have stronger than stock valve
springs, and combined with the 1.25 rockers I'd say the valve train is
probably putting the stock cam under way more stress than it was designed
for.  If you're not spinning the engine over 5K I'd tell the shop to put
some weaker valve springs on the heads and maybe ditch the 1.25 rockers in
favor of stock ones.  I bet that will solve your problem.  You may lose a
little power, but then again you may not.  Put the bus on a dyno before and
after to find out for sure.
