My guess is that your '75 was converted  from FI to carb(s) and that you are experiencing icing.

&gt;My 1975 Riviera camper runs GREAT!  Except when it is damp and moderately cold outside as it was this morning (40 degrees and foggy in Cincinnati). Under these conditions, It will not
&gt;hold an idle.  Runs fine as long as my foot stays on the accelerator, but as soon as I stop giving gas, it stalls.  It starts right up again after this.
