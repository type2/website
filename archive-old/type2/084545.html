&gt;So, after I drove the bus this weekend, I thought
&gt;the point gap may have changed and it was a
&gt;little off at 40 dwell and a little more than
&gt;.016.  I reset it to get 54 dwell and .016.

Huh?  You can't change the dwell without changing the point gap.

&gt;Then I hooked up the strobe.  Amazed to find that
&gt;I could remember how to do it (prolly 12 years
&gt;since I used it last, when I last owned an
&gt;aircooled bus).  With the vac hoses on, it was
&gt;set real close to 10 atdc at idle but would only
&gt;advance to about 25 btdc at rpm.  Not nearly
&gt;enough, right?

Right.

&gt;   The idle retard definitely
&gt;worked.  With it off the idle was a few degrees
&gt;btdc.  Disconnecting the vacuum advance had no
&gt;apparent affect on the timing.

At idle this is correct.

&gt;So I began checking vacuum.  FWIW the two ports
&gt;on the left solex are as follows:  the right port
&gt;has vacuum at idle (and therefore should be
&gt;connected to the idle retard on the inner face of
&gt;the vac pot) and the left port has vacuum at open
&gt;throttle (and therefore should be connected to
&gt;the advance on the outer face of the vac pot).
&gt;Am I right so far?

Are you sure you don't have those reversed?  My memory is that the left 
port (slightly larger, at the throttle plate) has vacuum at idle.  You are 
right though about where each type should be connected.

&gt;I checked the vac advance on the outer face of
&gt;the vac pot by hooking up the guage and squeezing
&gt;to get vacuum.  It held it.  Same way with the
&gt;retard.  The advance appeared to shift the plate
&gt;when I sucked.  Maybe not enough?

Did you notice an advance in timing when you did this?

&gt;Anyway, I ran out of time.  I intend to double
&gt;check dwell at rpm; check the amount of vacuum
&gt;coming off the carb ports at idle and at rpm
&gt;(2500-3000 right?);

Idle or 3000 rpm will make little difference.  Vacuum advance can only 
really be observed when the throttle is substantially open, and at a 
sustained 3000rpm, it's not open enough to get a good measurement.  For a 
quick check, &quot;goose&quot; the throttle and you should see vacuum briefly 
register on the gauge, 5-8 inches or so.

&gt;try to double check that the
&gt;plate to see if it is still moving when the vac
&gt;advance is sucked; and replace vac line.  It is
&gt;new and seems to seal but I just got the right
&gt;stuff from Ron so I'll do it to ensure its not a
&gt;line problem.

Check for timing advance when you do this.  Try to determine how much 
advance you get.


&gt;Anyway, I guess I have a dual vac that runs like
&gt;a 009 until I figure out how to make the advance
&gt;worked.

You're already getting more advance than an 009 can supply, but not the 
full amount as it appears your vacuum advance isn't functioning.

I don't have the specs in front of me, but you should have *about* 45-50 
degrees maximum, which is the sum of:

Centrifugal (both lines disconnected, difference btw idle and 3000rpm)
Retard (you have observed about 12 degrees)
Advance (at idle, difference between sucking on advance hose or not)
