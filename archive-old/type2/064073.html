I don't have one of these on any of my VW's but the big C60 Chevy trucks 
that I drive at work have some kind of rev limiter and it works great.  
You hit 70 and she just won't &quot;go no mo..&quot;.  When I'm driving it, the

limit, the engine just mellows out.  I think having one on a bus would be 
a good idea myself...
