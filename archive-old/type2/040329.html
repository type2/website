Subject: Re: compression results:( ...was what happened?

Shelby:
recheck valve adjustment on #1 and retest.
the &quot;depression &quot; gauge must be used on
a fully warm engine, all plugs out, throttle
wide open, no gas supply, and the same
number of cranking revolutions per test.
 since #2 is a good number, the head
torque is not suspect.
there could be a crack in the head, a bent
valve, cracked cylinder, piston, etc.
pop the head and remove the piston, and
let's have a look- at least that part is free !
and stop whinin' !!!!
