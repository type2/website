Subject: horn substitute/replacement

	The horn on my '72 is dead.  I checked the local parts places and they 
all have some generic european horn which looks almost identical to the 
original.  It comes in a high or a low note.  Do either of these horns 
sound like the original or should I hold off till I find a Hella?
Thanks

ED
