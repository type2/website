&gt;Digifant: The page I saw about Digifant says it's VW's version of L-
&gt;Jetronic; he then gave a description of it and from that it sounds like a
&gt;version of Motronic.

Digijet was VW's own L-jet (for the '83-'85 Vanagon) basically
identical in parts and function to an L-jet off a Bus just for the
bigger engine and with some detail changes here an there that
Bosch was applying across the board (all have 02 feedback?)

Digifant means different things to different cars, in the vanagon it
was sort of Motronic with advance built into the ECU but without
hot wire AFM (which Motronics mostly have) so a &quot;cheap Motronic.&quot;
In the '89-'92 Jetta it was sort of the same I think a vane type AFM
again.  In the '90-'92 Corrado and the '93-'98 EV it is sort of the
same but without an AFM at all, stepping back in time to using
a MAP sensor (something Bosch maligned for years.)

So who the heck knows.  To a Vanagon Digifant means something
that has no cans on the dizzy, spark control in the ECU, and is a
multiport (but NOT sequential) injection system.  Used primarily on
the US model 2.1's and some Euro 1.9's I think.
