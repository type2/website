Subject: scary noise

So I'm cruising up 99w to Portland on Saturday, my freshly tuned 1600
purring like a kitten.. then I here a slight tapping. It starts soft (2-3
times a second at 50mph) but then I hit a wee incline and it gets worse. I
drop the gas and it softens a bit but doesn't go away. I pass the incline,
slow to 35 and gear down, it continues but slower. I hit another slight hill
and near the top it gets really bad,  the tap turns into a rather
frightening KNOCK, like hitting the undercarriage with a socket wrench. Then
I called AAA.

Here are the symptoms.

- It shifts fine, no slop/grind/pop (new clutch &lt;7k mile)
- gets worse/louder/harder with more load
- frequency increases with speed of bus, not the engine
- sound emminates from near the tranny but I could feel the tap in my
feet/pedals when it got bad
- I also noticed that it dampened when I veered right - I tested this before
it got too bad. Drove down the center of the road and could here it, weaved
left and it got worse, weaved right and it almost went away.

Lastly,  as I was coasting and pulling over, it got even worse (holy hell)
as I was braking onto the shoulder.

Any ideas on what I'm looking at? Is it painfullly obvious?

Thanks Much,
Ryan
