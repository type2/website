+AD4-Theres a piece of tinware that was nearly rusted through on the '77 engine
I bought. It looks like a heat shield. It apparently goes between the
muffler and the fan hub area...below the rear deck.

+AD4-Is this piece available new that anyone knows of? I'm scouting locally but
so far have come up dry.
+AD4-
+AD4-Thanks+ACE- Joe
+AD4-
I just got one from Just Kampers in UK. Genuine VW NOS for 12.5 pounds, but
I don't know if this is local for you.
