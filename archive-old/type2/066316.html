Subject: Brake shoe linings

 Poking around in my FLAPS a few days ago and came across some new
brake shoes labeled as &quot;Kevlar linings&quot;.

 Asked my main man there and he seemed to feel they were only for 
nasty ole Dune-buggers. 

 Said they ate the drums.

 One of the latest vw mags has another add listing &quot;Abex&quot; linings,
also for Dune-buggers.

 I have expressed my displeasure with my present &quot;life-time warranteed
linings&quot; before on the list.

 I feel I want to live longer than the shoes or the drums personally.

 Has any one got any info on either of the above linings?


   west -  and  for all the times I forget, thank you all in perpetuity.
