A Type 3 engine is almost identical to a Type 1 engine.  The difference is
that most of them came stock with dual carbs (or fuel injection for the
later years) and all of them have different engine tin/fan housing because
the fan is direct drive (attached to the engine pulley) instead of being
driven off of the generator.

&gt; 
&gt; The title line says Type 3 and 4 vehicles. I know that Type 3 vehicles
&gt; would
&gt; be Fastbacks, Squarebacks, etc. I don't know what Type 4 vehicles might
&gt; be.
&gt; In the body of the article it refers to Type 3 and 4 engines. OK, I know
&gt; what a Type 4 engines is. That's what's in my bus. I've don't know what a
&gt; Type 3 engine is.
