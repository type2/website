Subject: Re: [T2] Oh no! Burned a ring!

&gt; &gt;In the 10 years I've owned my bus, I've burned rings 3x and lost valves
&gt; &gt;0x. What are other folks' numbers on this?
&gt;
&gt; I suspect the add on oil cooler. Not enough volume coming off the crank to
&gt; splash the backs of the pistons and cool them. The extra friction loss of
&gt; add on coolers and hoses tends to overwhelm the oil pumps capacity, hence,
&gt; less flow at the crank, less splash to cool the pistons.

Would my head temp sensor give me an indication of this? It generally runs
rock steady at 350F, only pushing towards 400F under long upgrade &amp; heavy
load scenarios.

I am inclined to lose the add on oil cooler. Although it has dramaticlly
reduced my oil temp, the survival rates of my engines seem to speak for
themselves.
