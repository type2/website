Subject: Re: [T2] LOUD FUEL PUMP?

FWIW, Ford uses the same pump (or at least close enough.)  Used on '86 
and later Rangers, Bronco IIs, full-sized pick em ups. The Vanagon crowd 
has known this little secret for years. Knowing that will certainly 
widen your junkyard tours and definitely improve your chances of success.
