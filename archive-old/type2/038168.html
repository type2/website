nancy,please check if the bulbs are functioning 
during these three symptom conditions and
report : i.e., bulbs f/r both work when sound is
normal (same as left side).
the sound you hear is the relay under the dash
and is particularly sensitive to intermittent bulb
contact. so clean those bulbs and then test, o.k. ?!
also check if 4-way flasher works all 4 bulbs !
