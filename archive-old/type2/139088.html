I agree. The thing is this: you cannot do it yourself anyway.

Balancing the rotating parts is done on a machine that costs in the high 5
to low 6 figures. The rotating parts (crank and everything attached to it)
must be spun in the machine. A good shop will balance the parts one piece at
a time, starting with the crank, then working outwards one piece at a time
until all parts are assembled to it, fan hub, crank pulleys, flywheel,
pressure plate etc.

All you can do is balance the pistons and if you build the fixture, the
rods. If you are paying a shop to do the rest anyhow, there is not much
point to DIY. The shop we use charges 175.00 to do a complete 4-cylinder
engine, which is a bargain imo, especially considering they do the job to a
very precise tolerance, about .1 gram for most of the parts.
