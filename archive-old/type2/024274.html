 I have a 2.0 short block that is tight, that died of a broken valve. I received it with just the pistons and rods hanging out of it. I think it's hydraulic. Been sitting around for a while. It's free if you want it, I got a spare running 2.0 last year from a parts bus.

I am in southern NH but I am heading down to the berkshires, Ancramdale, NY (sp?)next month. I will be in Bridgeport, CT in a couple weeks. Not sure where you are?
