&lt;&lt; This varies tremendously by state!  It is very local and something that
each individual should inquire about locally.  Some states require a
salvage (or other name implying really bad prior damage) as a cunsumer
protection, others do not.  The threshholds vary as well.  If you have a
bus &quot;totalled&quot; inquire locally before you sign anything!

The ones that do not are often the ones used to &quot;wash&quot; a title of its
salvage designation...Most of the list members here are honest e-
nough to describe the bus they're selling as a &quot;parts bus&quot; or such,
but &quot;caveat emptor&quot;...
