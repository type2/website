&gt; 
&gt; Anyway, anyone want to respond to her questions about autotrans?
&gt; 
&gt; Answers should be sent to her not to the list. You might not get a response
&gt; but will prove what an asset this list is to the new bus owner.

&gt; Sent responses to her, not the list at:

&gt;  What do you know about vans with automatic transmissions--I have a friend
&gt;  who has had a van before and is dying to get another.  She
&gt;  has found a '73 with automatic.  What do you think?  It has a little
&gt;  rust.  They want $1200.  Are these OK or to be avoided? &gt;&gt;

I had one once, bought it with a broken tranny, put a kit in the tranny,
had to set ALL advance specs correctly including buying a new vac
advance. It worked great! Sold it after a couple of years to people with
16 and 17 year old boys- they had nothing but trouble. So was it a good
car? Depends on your outlook, I guess! It was not quite as fast as a
stick car though.
