Has anyone ever heard of this book?

Plans and instructions for Volkswagen van camper 
by Clinton R. Hull, published by Trail-R-Club of AMerica, 1976. It's classified as a &quot;trade paperback.&quot;

I've found it for about $28 in &quot;nearly good condition.&quot; You know all I know now, except where it is. 

If you've seen it before, I'd love to hear your input on whether it would be worth having now. If you haven't seen it before, well, I'll share info when and if I get it.

Thanks! Joe
