Subject: [AIRS] just a stay over really

We were fortunate to have a few bus travelers spend the night in our
year last night. One of our family members had mentioned to my wife
that they saw a yellow VW pull into our local wal-mart earlier in the
day. However I was quite surprised to find that when we left where we
were having dinner I saw a chrome yellow westy in the lot w/ cargo
door wide open. Naturally we made a u-turn and headed off to see if
they needed anything. We met the nicest couple Pete and Cynthia. Turns
out they were on their way back from Colorado and going to Bonnaroo in
the morning. Left our number with them after a bit of chatting and
told them to call if they wanted a safe place to plug in. 

They took us up on the offer and we had a nice visit talking vw's and
such. Early this morning they took off, but keep an eye out for a
chrome yellow westy with 2 younger adults. Offer them a place if they
need it. They should be driving back home to the north-east after the
weekend. No bus problems so hopefully they should make it with no
problems. Just thought I would share my nice visit.
