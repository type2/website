Good Point Dave---

Yep grease, cosmoline, used Kentucky Fried chicken grease, or just spray
a coat of used gear oil on the whole bus--these are the most cost
efficiant coatings I can possibly think of----and will slow down the
vehicle from rusting any further----until the next owner decides to do
something with it.


Later,


Terry

I guess the point I was attempting to make was, if you can't afford the
proper procedures at this time ( which was suggested ) don't do it it
all, or at best apply something that won't cause any dismay, when the
time comes to do the job right. 
Or just leave it for the next owner to fix. ( Type 2 library-
&quot;acronyms&quot;- &quot; PO &quot; :) 
Try axle grease, it will prevent rust, removes easily, and will surely
protect against parking lot dings. Dave \X/
