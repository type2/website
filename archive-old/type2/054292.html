Subject: When to inject

I got a question that's been buggin the hell outta me on my 76fi.  What
I am trying to figure out is how the computer knows which cylinder is
going to fire and then know to open that cylinder's injector.  I know
that it's getting it's timing from the points, but the points don't tell
it which cylinder is firing, just when.

So, do all the injectors open on every cycle of the points opening and
closing or is there actually some way that the computer is able to know
which cylinder is going to fire a particular time, therefore opening
that respective injector.

Thanks!
Mike
