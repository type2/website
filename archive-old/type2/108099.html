Hey Folks,

Last little post before I am out of communication.

For those of you arriving after 9 pm, there are a few courtesies to adhere
to.

&gt;&gt;Please drive very slow through the park.  The rangers do not have a sense
of humor.

&gt;&gt;When you enter, drive around the right side of large recreation building,
and first drive to the right will be ours.

&gt;&gt;If you are bringing a pet (they are welcome) please keep fido or feline on
a leash.  Again, no sense of humor.

I can be reached at 614-507-0338.

Rustic Knolls, open until 9pm, 614-397-9318.

Sounds as if we are going to have an awesome turn out.

Beep Beep,
HapyBus
