Brandy asked:-

&gt;Why is it you can/should not just pull a spark plug wire off the cap
&gt;while the motor is running?  I thought I heard someone say that was
&gt;bad, but don't remember why?

I think if you just pull a plug lead off instead of shorting it to
ground then you will not be discharging the coil so the 'size' of spark
and the burn characteristic will be changed for the next cylinder thus
upsetting the test.

Shorting the leads also reduces the time when your engine is running
out of balance
