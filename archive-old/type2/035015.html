&gt; I'm just curious to know if it is possible to fit the opening quarterlights
&gt;  to the cab doors of my 1970 bus - which currently has the fixed style.  I'd
&gt;  rather keep the doors themselves - as they're in pretty good shape.
&gt;  
&gt;  Anyone tried this ?

Yes these are a direct swap - but you will need to get a different rubber 
strip for the front of the channel between the main window and the quarter 
light.

Just Kampers sales all the rubber parts and you should be able to pick up 
opening quarter lights at one of the shows / swap meets see 
www.soft_dot_net_dot_uk/vwt2oc for details of some the up and coming UK events where 
you may be able to pick some up.

Good luck
