Hi ALl,

&gt; OK, it's Friday and I figured maybe nobody would mind if I 
brought up a
&gt; low-VW-content topic. Besides, after this weeks long 
philosophical
&gt; questions about the dimples on golf balls, I thought I 
could be
&gt; forgiven.
&gt; 
&gt; Here's my question for you VW historians out there: where 
did VW come up
&gt; with the idea for the VW transporter? 

Saint Ben Pon came up with the idea after touring the 
bombed out VW factory and seeing a work truck (actually a 
modified Beetle chassis) that was used in house for 
delivering parts. He figured that in post war Germany/Europe 
there would be a market for a low tech affordable means of 
delivering goods and set about drawing a rough sketch in his 
notebook of what the the Type II (as it would become known) 
would look like. As the VW Bus is still around, evidently he 
was right. :) It is worth noting that  I am _reasonably 
sure_ that amongst other &quot;VW Type II firsts&quot; was the sliding 
cargo door, double cargo doors on either side etc. I find it 
amusing that North American mini van engineer's have just 
&quot;re-discovered&quot; this idea
