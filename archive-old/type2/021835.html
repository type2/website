Subject: Re: [T2] Re:Drop an engine, giving away a bus

Hmmmmmmmmmmmmm!  I thought you could only remove the bumper and slide 
the engine out on the older busses???  You can also do this on the 76 
and 78 models??

&gt;   &quot;..... I was wondering if there are any references that I should
&gt; look at before dropping the engine.  I have the bentley, muir, and
&gt; haynes manuals so I'll gives those a thorough look-through...&quot;
&gt; -You've got all the info you'll need
&gt; 
&gt; &quot;...The thing that I really want to know is what tools do I need!  I 
&gt; will have two floor jacks (the pump type), jack stands, wheel stands, a 
&gt; buncha your normal sockets and drivers, and I'm gonna go buy some
&gt; ratcheting box wrenches.  Is there anything else I need?&quot;
&gt; -I never needed any special tools to remove or install the engine in our 77
&gt; 
&gt; &quot;...I'm concerned on how high I need to lift the bus to get the engines 
&gt; out?..&quot;
&gt; -You won't need to jack up the bus at all.  Again, on our 77 I used to 
&gt; remove the rear bumper, drop the engine down, slide it off the jack onto 
&gt; a piece of thin plywood, and then roll the bus forward to uncover the 
&gt; engine.  I suppose if your bus is sagging way down in the back this 
&gt; might not work.
