Subject: Re: [T2] fuel gauge spike

&gt;&gt; friend of mine wants to know what would make a half empty fuel gauge 
&gt;&gt; spike
&gt;&gt; full?
&gt;
&gt; Mostly, a short in the sender;
&gt; occasionally, a short in the gauge;
&gt; rarely, flipping the bus on its side.
&gt;

   My gauge flips around as a result of the sloshing of the gas in the 
tank, but otherwise reads accurately.  If half full, it will frequently 
hit the 1/1 mark if I'm driving over high-amplitude terrain or 
otherwise rocking the bus (grin).
   Is this normal?  The gauge responding to sloshing fuel, I mean.  Or 
should there be some damping in the system, as with every other vehicle 
I've driven?  If there should be damping, is it in the gauge (my guess) 
and how would I go about restoring its function?  TIA
