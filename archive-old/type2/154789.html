Subject: RE: [T2] Pivot Pin Replacement pitfalls

I had the same shop do ball joints and the pivot pin at the same time.  Some
things are worth paying someone else to do!

Okay my bushing part numbers are 211.405.317 B (weird SK thing) Fd

I'm also one of those well I'm gonna try it anyways and see kind of people.
After seeing the busboys tool, I think that allthread is the way to do it.
Especially if I have most of the parts I need already here.

thanks for all the info, if the weather holds I should be doing the work
tomorrow.
