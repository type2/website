Subject: Re: [T2] High beam stuck on

&gt;One thing to check would be if the wires that connect right below the
&gt;steeing wheel are actually connected. One night my bus would not
&gt;switch beams (mine stuck on low) nor would the horn work. Turned out
&gt;the connector on the steering column (nearest you while driving) had
&gt;jostled loose after a bump in the road. Easy &amp; simple. I don't have
&gt;the bentley in front of me to check if the lights will actually
&gt;default to on, but they might.


Good info!

Also the relay that toggles between low beam and high beam. The contacts 
for the high beam may have fused leaving the relay stuck in the HB position.

If you have the Bentley schematic you could remove the relay and use a 
multimeter to see if the column switch is stuck in the high beam position 
or if it is clicking from HB to LB properly.

You could also do a continuity test through the relay to see if the relay 
is stuck with the HB contacts closed.
