Subject: Re: Clutch for Sure

Both of the pressure plates that broke on my 77 Westy
and my daughters 77 Westy were Sachs.
The replacement I put in my daughters was a Sachs, no
problem for the past 2 years
The replacement I put in mine was a LUK, it would NOT
disengage!!  I had to R&amp;R the engine again and replace
it with a Sachs.....

 I am going to be doing the engine drop and in
 preparation for the worst 
 case scenario I am wondering what the ideal
 clutch(es) is(are) for my 
 1973 4spd (+R) Manual 1700cc Safare.
 
 I was looking at the various choices on Busdepot but
 I don't really 
 know enough to know the pros and cons of each.
 
 Being that the clutches seem to range from 100 to
 200 dollars I'm not 
 really worried about cost, I just want to get a good
 solid clutch that 
 will stick around.
