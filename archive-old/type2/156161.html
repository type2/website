Subject: Re: [T2] WANTED: 71 Westy (with certain features)

&gt;  PS: The reason I want the 71 is the indicator lenses front and back, small
&gt;  5-lug pattern, and power brakes. I am willing to accept a 68-70, if it has
&gt;  the NON-WALKTHRU front (and I'll add the other stuff on in time).
&gt;
&gt;  ----------------------------------------------------------------------
&gt;
&gt; Then you want the SO-69/1 or /3 model Westy. It has all the Westy pieces along the bulkhead. Solid glass
&gt; drivers side middle window, tall wardrobe behind the
&gt; driver, sink unit, stove unit, and cooler in line.

or a dormobile/westy, mad uncle dave has one.
i think its essentially an so69 interior and a dormobile top.
