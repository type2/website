Subject: Re: [T2] R: [T2] Trash into oil

The original post was about an ecological one (i guess!). 
I hope that all car will do 50mpg one day, and it is pissing me off to 
have that unburn fuel in the back of my Westy, but i think am better off 
whit this little one then a 30 foots V-10 RV.

Am not bashing the SUV in particular,  am bashing those who don't have a 
&quot;conscience&quot; because they live in one of bigest and most free (sorry for 
my English here) continent in the world. America thinks big, it could 
think a bit smaller, that's what am trying to say. IMAO :-)
My mom just bought a small SUV!!!! i was mad as hell (at least it's a 
very small V6 that would fit nicely in my Bus, he he he) , but like you 
said, it's a free country! If you did a bit of traveling, it's chocking 
to see how big and powerful the car/truck are in America.

 &gt;&gt;&gt;Lets go back to what we're here for, the Bus, and may it remain a 
part of an active link to history for many generations to enjoy.&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;

That is the point, will it be others generations if some still keep 
thinking big????
I guess you right, we could go on for ever on that subject, drinkable 
water is a good exemple!!! But its not the place for that, sorry about that.

Have a good weekend Stan

&gt;Even though I have no interest in owning one, the
&gt;people that buy the SUV's do so because of choice,
&gt;freedom of choice (something many would perfer they
&gt;didn't have).  SUV's may be part of the problem but
&gt;not the only problem, they're just the vehicle that is
&gt;politically correct to rag on.  One day all cars will
&gt;get 50+ mpg and those that don't won't be allowed on
&gt;the road, and when that day comes we'll get that note
&gt;in the mail informing us that our bus no longer
&gt;conforms and it needs to be disposed of.
&gt;
&gt;Well that is my nickles' worth to a thread that
&gt;started with a interesting article and has hopefully
&gt;bottomed out with what you see above.  Lets go back to
&gt;what we're here for, the Bus, and may it remain a part
&gt;of an active link to history for many generations to
&gt;enjoy.
