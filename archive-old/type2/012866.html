Stan Wilder:

I had a Conputron or Compufire or what ever it's called.

It was krap and they wouldn't warranty it. They had it at their factory
and started in accusing me of some type of abuse of the unit and I told
them to throw it in the trash where it belonged and just forget the whole
thing.

I've had Allison units that lasted un-attended for ten or more years.
They're a little different but they work. (the Allison units were on MG's
and GM products.)

Stan
