Subject: '71 camper for sale in OK

I finally got my problem solved as far as reading the list goes. It's not as
convenient but it'll have to do for now. There's a guy here in Bartlesville, OK
that has a 1971 station wagon with a camper interior (not a pop top) for sale.
Bodies straight with a touch of rust below the windshield and a slight crease on
the lower left side. White over orange. Needs brake work. Has an engine but not
sure about condition. He's asking $1500 for it but I imagine he would take less.
This guy is an aquantance so the info I listed is what I've been told. If
interested, call Shawn Barnes _at_ 918-337-0701 for more info. Have a good
weekend!!! Oh yeh, Bartlesville is about 45 miles North of Tulsa, corporate
headquarters for Phillips Petroleum.(FYI)
