Subject: Fuel pump - which way up ?

I've decided to replace Ashleys fuel pump and have bought a nice new one
from my VW FLAPS, 'cos I can't get a rebuild kit.. Engine is a 1600 Type 1.

Now I know there are 2 types of pump, one for alternators and one for
dynamos. I have the alternator one (I think) in at present and have bought
the dynamo one as it will fit much better - the current incumbent is a
tight fit and will have to be dismantled to be removed. The engine is a
recon one (2 owners before me) and I'm not convinced the correct pump was
ever fitted by the PO. I do have an alternator on the engine.

As I understand it, there are two lengths of push rods. Can anyone remember
them though ? I can't seem to find this info. Apart from this, is there any
difference between the types of pumps ? I think it is just configuration as
the alternator thingy gets in the way of the dynamo pump.

Now the big question, the pump has in inlet &amp; outlet. One points straight
up and the other sticks out the side. This is a Brazilian pump which is
sealed (quite dinky and smart looking though) and there is no indication
which is which. Anyone any ideas ?

You are probably wondering why I didn't ask the guy in the shop, well at
German &amp; Swedish, Leamington Spa, there has been a complete change of
staff. Gone are the knowledgeable friendly people with free adverts and
pics of VWs on the wall. The replacement has the customer service skills
and knowledge of a fencepost. I really hope this is a short term thing :-(
