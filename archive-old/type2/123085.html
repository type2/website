&gt; Not sure what to make of this one.  Went to start it up on a cold day.
&gt; It fired right up and I let it run for about four or five minutes.
&gt; Backed out of my parking spot, put it in first, gave it some gas and it
&gt; died.  At first I thought I just stalled it, so I restarted it, let it
&gt; run for a minute, and then it died again before I even put it in gear.
&gt; And would not start after that.  The engine turns over but it won't
&gt; catch.  I think it might not be getting spark but I'm not sure.  Any
&gt; help is appreciated.

try checking all your vacuum lines, sometimes when you stall em like that
it blows off a vacuum line......
