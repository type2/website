Subject: Re: Dumb Heat Question

As has been posted, someone who advertises in DBHVW has a kit to put a 
little oilcooler/heater in the interior, but I would make sure the oil
lines are as short as possible (not, for instance, putting the oil cooler
under the dash of a van).  The type 1 and 4 engines, unlike the Porsche
six, have a single-stage oil pump, so whatever oil pressure is left after
the oil has been out to the cooler and come back is what your crank
journals will live with.  Also critical to put a thermostat in line so
that the oil pump doesn't pop the cooler by pumping cold thick oil through
it.

Someone might like to experiment with the &quot;extra&quot; pump that an engine
originally used with an automatic trans has.  Maybe use that to move
oil or trans fluid through a pipe that winds around the headers?

Anyway, clearly not a dumb question, just no simple answers or VW
woulda done it.
