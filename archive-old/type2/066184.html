&gt;My 75 as mentioned is a &quot;Deluxe&quot; because it came with the fridge. The
&gt;fridge would be great if I ever get it to work. The option mine lacks 
&gt;right now is the roof linen cabinet which I think I might be obtaining 
&gt;from you. 

For some reason, no '74 and '75 Westies came with this cabinet.  That does 
not mean you couldn't install one from a '76-79.
