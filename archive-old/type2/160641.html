Subject: Federal or California, '78 or '79 GE engine??

The engine in the '74 bus is coded GE.  It is apparently a FI engine that
had a Weber carburetor patched onto it.

It has a '72-74 or '79 type heat exchangers with the trapezoid flange type,
not the triangle flange type.

Now, this GE engine also has a crossover pipe, exhaust elbow, catalytic
converter, muffler, and tail pipe.  It does NOT have the catalytic converter
tucked up under the left side of the exhaust system, so I expect the engine
is NOT a '79 California engine.

With this bit of empirical evidence, can I safely ASSUME that the engine is


a) a '79 Federal with square exhaust ports,

b) not a '79 California with square exhaust ports because of the position of
the catalytic converter,

c) not a '78 Federal that had the benefit of the '72-'74 heat exchangers but
someone thought it cute to needlessly slap on a crossover pipe and elbow and
cat converter just for giggles, and not use the '72 - '74 muffler,

d) not a '78 California that lost the exhaust manifolds and the 'U'
afterburner tubes and the triangular flanged heat exchanger, replaced them
with the '72 - '74 heat exchangers, but really needed the cat converter to
pass a visual inspection so some PO miraculously found a trapezoidal flange
crossover pipe that they could attach for the needed elbow/cat/muffler
setup.

e) not a '78 Federal that some PO wanted to add a catalytic converter to the
exhaust system because they thought it would help pass emissions inspection,
but couldn't find a '76 - '78 crossover pipe so they kludged together this
whole Frankenstein

f) not worth the effort to rescue a square ported exhaust / trapezoidal
flanged pair of solid heat exchangers with crossover pipe because the only
value it has is for a '79 Federal....

((my head hurts...))
