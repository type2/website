Subject: BA6 leaking? &amp; Famous again

O.K I fitted the BA6 a couple of months ago &amp; the tank was half full -I know
coz I drank the other half when the pipe fell off :(-

When we came to move the bus onto the ramp for welding, the tank had
emptied. I filled it up with 1 gallon &amp; a week later it again had gone,
there are no signs of a leak &amp; all the pipes seem sound.
I was wondering if the fuel was getting past the BA6 fuel pump &amp; into the
heater then evaporating?

Any ideas?

As to fame, I said that Mr Whipy was in 'Total VW' well were in there again
this month! This time as an advert to other clubs to register for a club
list, on page 27, Mr Whipy is the High-top _at_ the end &amp; myself &amp; Denise are
in the small pic underneath 2 on the left.

All this fame, I'll have to call my agent ;}
