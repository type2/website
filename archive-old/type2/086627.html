Dont take this the wrong way, I don't mean any harm here.

This is just the kind of stuff that upsets me. I once sold a very clean 924
Porsche to a kid. He was 16 had just gotten his liscense and had to have
the car. I tried to talk him out of it because it was not a good 'first'
car. The kid could not drive stick to begin with. No matter what I said
there was no changing his mind. Since he was under 18 I made his mom sign
the paper work. I tried to talk her  out of it too. So anyway  the kid goes
off stalling and lurching and lugging down the road. He worked for Best Buy
and installed car stereos for them. Well he figured masking tape and
twisting the wires together was okay too. The kid got this huge mother of
all stereo systems and installs it in the car. Cranks it up real loud for
all of his buddies, then shuts it down and goes inside to eat dinner. 15
minutes later ther is a lot of commotion outside and a knock at the door.
It was a fireman who just finished putting out the kid's car and wanted to
know what he wanted to do.

Sorry for the lack of bus content here. There are areas where shoddy work
to save a buck is a matter of personal choice but for me there are a few
areas where you just have to do it right.

1. FUEL LINES
2. Brakes
3. Electrical
4. Suspension

You may not be able to afford to do it right,  but think of the passengers
and other folks on the road around you.

&gt;found some pretty creative repairs and patches here and there. I guess
&gt;my only real complaint is with the wiring -- why do people refuse to
&gt;use wire connectors?

Some shoddy wiring (around the radio only) is the one kludge I indulge
myself in. Soldering proper connectors and so forth is just more work that
I
think the radio is worth, when twisting wires together and covering them up

with masking tape does the job just fine. I keep telling myself &quot;next time
it's warm, I'll solder them proper.&quot;
