&lt;&lt; While browsing the satellite TV newsgroup, I came upon a discussion of
audio/component racks, and found this-for those putting in a stereo in
the van or wishing to dampen panel resonances....
http://tnt-audio_dot_com/clinica/noise.html
-for a disc. on using tar sheets: 
http://tnt-audio_dot_com/clinica/dampere.html
the usual tar mats from a FLAPS can be used or a product called &quot;Noise
Killer&quot;  by Rockford Fosgate- anyone ever hear of this or use it?  It is
a spray on product.
RockfordFosgate has a website, and a phone 800-366-2349 &gt;&gt;

www.partsexpress_dot_com

has it for about ten bucks a 16 oz. can (one door)...How much is the
Rockford-Fosgate stuff ?
I'd also bet that 3-M probaly has it in their line too. R-F probably doesn't
make it but just has their label on someone's can...
