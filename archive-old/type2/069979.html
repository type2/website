Subject: Heat and Friction: an Experiment

        Here's an idea:  we can take all the hot air produced from the &quot;Heat
and Friction&quot; combined with the &quot;Motor vs Generator&quot; thread, and see how
many vw's we can power for a week.

        These have to be some of the silliest threads I have ever seen,
except for some of Ted &quot;Wing Commander&quot; Matsumara's contributions to the
Porsche list.

        The laws of physics are what are.  Let them work as they may; you
can't fold, spindle, mutilate or sprain them, so arguing for a week about
them isn't going to do anyone any good.

        People are going to call things what they want, be it motor,
powerplant, engine, &quot;thing in the back/front that makes a lot of noise&quot; or
&quot;the part that use to make a lot of noise but suddenly fell silent after
producing a large bang and clanking noise.&quot;

        If this list was a horse, sometimes I'd swear I'd have to shoot it.
