Subject: Re: [T2] Any More Power from a Pertronix &quot;Flame Thrower&quot; coil?

&gt; I'm looking at an advertisment from Pertronix about their

When looking at claims, the first question you should ask is if the claim
is measureable.  This one isn't.

&gt; and allows for larger plug gaps, which produces
&gt;greater fuel efficiency and power.

This might be measurable, but the difference won't be huge.

&gt;  I'm running a basically stock set-up
&gt;in my '71.  Upgraded to a Bosch 009 Distributor and Pertronix Ignitor.

This isn't really much of an upgrade.  The 009 distributor isn't ideal for
a bus application (it needs revs to advance, so it tends to hesitate while
starting off)  The pertronix is just a replacement for the points.  The
advantage is that it doesn't wear like the points, the disadvantage is
that when a pertronix dies you are stranded.

&gt;Have always felt under-engined.  Can I get a few more hp out of a hot
&gt;coil?

Sure!

&gt; How much, as a percent?

About 1%.

&gt; Is there a down side?  Harder on the
&gt;engine?  Thx.

Any time you stress one conponent more than it was designed for, there is
a danger.  In this case, the primary wire feeding the coil from the
ignition switch will carry more current.  Consider your ignition switch
before making the change
