???If thermostat is not hooked up, default position for the air control
flaps is wide open!  NOT POSSIBLE to be closed all the way unless one
tightens the cable so flaps are closed when thermostat is stretched. 
IE- if he hooked it up to a failed thermostat (stretched all the time)
when engine is cold, it will never open up and overheat!  I drove my 78
Bus from 1986 until 1997 with the thermostat cable not hooked up!MB
221,000 mi on original unrebuilt engine......

&gt; Third - I recently had the bus set to tune up specs by a local shop. The
&gt; mechanic there told me I had the flap for the fan to oil cooler closed all
&gt; the way. Ok people can yell at me now for not hooking up the thermostat. So
&gt; per the mechanics instructions I opened it up a bit. The bus ran hotter than
&gt; ever -
