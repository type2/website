Subject: Bus Heat

&gt;Also, what about an
&gt;electric space heater plugged into whatever electric
&gt;system I end up with.

&gt;Forget it - won't work.  They draw way too much power.  You can 
&gt;only use them if you can plug in to wall power somewhere.  Rule of 
&gt;thumb - nothing that makes significant heat can run very long off 
&gt;of 12V.

I always use the 1 pound coffee can and toilet paper furnace. Burns rubbing
alcohol. Warm as toast and no fumes.
