Subject: Traffic Idling and Mtn. Driving..High Revs safer?

I'm heading to Montana in 4 days from the east
coast...

Could someone kindly offer some rule of thumb hot
weather/ mountain driving advice?

I've got a '72 Westy with a 1700 (c.r. of about 7-7.5
after adding .090 spacers)), dual dellorto carbs
(running rich), 009 _at_29 d.b.t.d.c.,and use high octane
gas.  I've got alot of gear...maybe 3-400lbs? and
possibly 1 or 2 passengers.

I'm familiar with the grab the dipstick test,and I'm
assuming to grab the Handle, not the wet end-

But what happens when one is stuck in traffic?  Is it
correct to idle at 2-3000rpms to keep air flowing?  At
what temp/humidity is this necessary?
What weather is too hot or too humid to idle even at
high rpms?  
Approx. how long before the &quot;dipstick&quot; would cool
enough to continue on after a pitstop?

For the mountains, is it just unwise to climb passes
during hot weather at all if you are carrying a couple
of passengers and gear?  
If you can reasonably make a long hill in 3rd, would
going in 2nd or even 1st reduce the load on the engine
and let it run cooler?

Relative specifics such as &quot;over 90 degrees in humid
weather&quot;  would be appreciated as I'm yet unfamiliar
with hot weather driving.

also, typically one would advance timning in the
mountains,but would retarding the timing cool things
down? 


Thanks ,

Shawn
