Subject: EGR system

I have read the previous posts re the EGR systems. I have purchased a '74 1
owner bus that has all the smog stuff there, however there are a few glitches
that I am trying to figure out. THe EGR filter is completely rotted out. I
found that Mid America has them for 170 bucks. UGH. Also, the main EGR valve
has a vacuum nipple that has no vac hose coming to or from it. Does anyone
have a vac hose and EGR system diagram/photo showing the coursing of hoses
etc?

Also, would you recomend buying the EGR filter and TRY to save all the smog
stuff, or should I remove it entirely? I have what appears to be an absolutely
complete system minus a few hoses. The smog pump and filter are there and
appear to be in working order. Does anyone know how to check those items?

Thanks
Chris
