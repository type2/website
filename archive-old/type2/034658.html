Subject: Built in aux power cable to dash!

As I was installing a CB radio that I got for Christmas (thanks, Mom and 
Dad) and an antenna that Nikki gave me (thanks Nikki!) I pondered how to 
run a hot wire from my auxillary fuse box (in my hanging closet above the 
battery) to the dash. I realized that VW had built one into the bus! They 
call it the wire to the rear window de-mister. But don't let that fool 
you. On each rear hatch screen is a wire. One of them is grounded. Forget 
about that one. The other is a straight shot to the switch on the dash. 
If you run a short patch from that terminal to your aux. power, you can 
then connect whatever you care to to the terminal on the dash (remove the 
ground wire to the switch, and the wire to the computer analysis plug). 

I also wired the tape deck to the switch. Instant aux power to the dash, 
clean installation.
