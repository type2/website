&gt; &gt;Many years ago, I bought a set of snap-on pullers (everyone has one
&gt; &gt;snap-on tool, this is mine :-) for way too much money and thru the years
I
&gt; &gt;have never regretted it.  If you have a 3-jaw puller, it fits right under
&gt; &gt;the three bolt ears of the hub, If you have a 2-jaw puller, it will fit
&gt; &gt;under the locating pin ear and the bolt ear opposite that.  I would
&gt; &gt;recommend inserting bolts in the holes in the ears to prevent distortion
&gt; &gt;while pulling (don't know if it works, but I do it habitually)
&gt;
&gt; This method did not work for me either.  I succeeded in &gt;bending the ears.
The only thing worse than a fan hub stuck to &gt;the crank is a *bent* fan hub
stuck to the crank.  My fan &gt;wobbled after that.  I was not able to bend it
back so I ended &gt;up filing the surface down flat to solve the problem.  The
next &gt;time I faced pulling the hub, I took the crank to a machine shop &gt;and
let them do it.  You can split the case without removing the &gt;hub.

I have always removed them attached to the fan. I remove the center bolt and
use 2 large pry bars. I stick a pry bar in the belt groove 180 apart and use
the housing to pry against. I press hard and quick on the bars and the fan
w/hub jumps off.
