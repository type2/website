&gt; Sorry about that folks, points are new and set to .016. Dist cap, rotor,
&gt; plugs, wires all new, all gapped to spec., all Bosch.

You're still getting too-short dwell? I'd start taking point gap out--the
engine cares more that the dwell is 50 degrees than it does that the point
gap is .016&quot; Maybe this is a weird set.
