&gt;A follow up to a post from a few weeks ago.  My 14 year old son recently
&gt;advanced to the state science fair competition. His project was automobiles
&gt;and aerodynamics.  He compared and measured the drag of a 60's era VW bus to
&gt;a Beetle and a Lamborghini Diablo.


I would also like to hear from him, and maybe even a photo.  I send my 
congrats to your son on a job well done, and keep us up to date.

Mike
