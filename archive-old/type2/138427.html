Subject: Propane tank for bay window westy

I am looking for a propane tank for my 74 Westy. If anyone knows where 
to acquire one in good condition that would be preferred. I would be 
willing to settle for one in less than good to measure so I can have 
one manufactured. I know there are tanks for Vanagons available but I 
want the original size tank and they(the Vanagon tanks) are to large 
for my taste. If anyone knows of a source for new tanks the correct 
size that would be great too. Thanks in advance for anyones help.....
