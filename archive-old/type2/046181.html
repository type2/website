In light of recent events this is an odd recc, but frankly I've been running
Firestone Wilderness AT's in 27x8.5R14 and they handle exceptionally
well and have lasted 35k so far with about half treadwear.  I don't doubt
I'll put 55-60k on them.  They are big tires though, and performance
suffers, IMHO handling and ride comfort are exceptional though, with
some road noise being my biggest complaint and that is isolated to a
band around 62 mph or so.

The 14&quot; is not recalled, I'm hoping it will be solely so I can get new tires
free not because I'm worried about their safety.  After all VW was never
foolish enough to recc a ridiculously low tire pressure (in an offroad tire
being driven at highway speeds no less) like a certain American
manufacturer.  Plus, I've thrown treads on the front and rear of Vanagons
and buses at interstate speeds with no ill effects.  Anyway it's a great
tire IMHO and was a bargain when I bought it and still is.

Another personal opinion though, I've put 50k on sets of Yoko 356's (which
I didn't care for around me, ribbed tread squirrley in the wet) and on the
370, both were exceptional tires all the way till the end of their reasonable
treadlifes.  If you are only get 25k out of them, I'd watch your inflation
pressures,
make sure you have the C load 370's (which the origional poster did,) and
frankly bitch if you only got 25k out of them, sound like a defective run to
me.  The 370 was long proven the tire of choice on the Vanagon list and
there are probably collectively millions of long wearing miles on them
among the people from that list.  It's availability has been spotty though
recently.
