Just got the roof rack back - wow, it is really amazing - unbelievable -
it must look better than new because new it was galvanized now it is
zinc plated, which, IMO, looks best.

The guy at the plating place says plating is tougher that galvanizing
but ..... who knows.

I had mine zinc plated too, but I don't think it holds up as well as
galvanizing for the roof rack.  Zinc plating bonds better to the steel than
galvanizing, but doesn't last as long because it is a thinner coating.  If
the steel flexes a lot like a spring, plating will stick better.  It also
looks better than galvanizing when new.

Zinc corrodes like aluminum rather than rusts.  When the top layer of the
zinc oxidizes, it creates a zinc oxide barrier that protects the zinc
underneath.  The oxygen can't hurt the corroded layer because it's already
oxidized.  With iron based metals, there is no layer, the rust actually digs
deeper under the old rust faster than clean smooth metal.  Zinc is referred
to as a self sacrificing metal because it will react with the available
oxygen faster than the iron so it is great as a steel rust preventer.  Even
if a small scratch goes all the way through to the bare steel, it will not
rust because the nearby zinc will protect it.  However, zinc is a very soft
metal.  The white powdery zinc oxide layer gets worn off, exposing the fresh
zinc underneath.  Eventually, the zinc layer is completely worn off in spots
and the steel is attacked.  Therefore, the thicker the coating of zinc, as
in galvanizing, the better.

What I did with my rack is zinc plate, then power coat to protect from wear,
then sand and clear coat to seal water tight.  I can sand and recoat the
clear finish as needed.  Any deep scratches that go to the steel will be
protected by the zinc.  What I have experienced is heavy dings to the rack
tend to chip the powder coat off the zinc plate (which is smooth and shiny
like chrome) which I then touch up with paint.  If I was to do it again
however, I would hot dip galvanize (rough dull surface), which is the
thickest form of zinc protection, and then maybe clear coat over that.
