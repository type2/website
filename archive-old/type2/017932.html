I'm an Arctic environmental specialist (geographer, environmentalist),
currently executive director of an environmental impact assessment
agency in Nunavut, the newest and largest jurisdiction in Canada born
April 1, 1999. Eleven months of the year, I watch the frozen arctic
ocean from my (bay!) window, dreaming of my '72 bus sitting in the
&quot;South&quot; 4,000 miles away, waiting for our annual family pilgrimage for a
too-short summer month of camping with it. I love my daily digest and
this virtual community of bus fan-addicts; it is perhaps my only
concrete link with the outside world and it's fun to know what all of
you out there are doing beside taking care of buses...so pleeeaase
Steven, be indulgent with this thread ...  ;-)
