After all the stories I've heard about the fuzz and all...

On my way home from work, 2 Sacramento PD's passed me, one giving me a
thumbs up, one giving me a peace sign.  And I had the safaris all the way
open, presumably illegal.  Monday night I passed a CHP on the side of the
road, and got a friendly wave, with the safaris open,again.

Another local listmember got pulled over for having his safaris open...
