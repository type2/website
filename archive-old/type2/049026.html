Subject: [T2] bench mark?

Gentlepersons-
                       Anybody out there replaced their front torsion leaves 
with new ones...not
good used, but new? I'm curious as to the specs with new leaves, since most 
of the ones
I've checked out seem awfully close to their rubber stops. Without a &quot;bench 
mark&quot; to 
judge against, I can't figure whether this is normal or the result of years 
of use...
TIA
