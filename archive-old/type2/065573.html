No Quarter sed:

&gt;But I've often thought of making some gizmo I can
&gt;put the car on and then put some heavy duty caster wheels on it so I can
&gt;roll the whole car around on the driveway.  If I had a forklift though,
&gt;I'd just lift the whole up. :-)

Forklift would be useful, but VW had a dolly like the one you describe.
Somewhere in my lit (VW Special Equipment for Local Manufacture) I've got
the plans for one -- it bolts into the tranny fork so you can move the car
about while the engine and tranny are out.
