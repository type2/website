&gt; and hasn't for the last year. here are the symptoms. sometimes the engine
&gt; runs like a top. sometimes it backfires like the timing is way out. sometime
&gt; after it has been running I'll shut it off and then try to restart it, the
&gt; engine will barely turn over, almost like a dead battery. i suspect a fuel
&gt; injection problem or an alternator problem. here are some of the things i
&gt; have tried. rebuilt alternator. fuel injection trouble shooting: double
&gt; relay, fuel  injectors, cold start valve, temp sensors, injector resistance
&gt; block, intake air sensor, and everything else the book tells me to do. when
&gt; its running i can get the timing and idle speed dead on. i shake electrical
&gt; connections and pull hoses trying to recreate the problem but can't track it
&gt; down. like i said it will run perfect, i think i found the problem and then
&gt; it starts backfiring again or turns over very slowly. I'm at my wits end.
&gt; this is my first vw i love it but so far its been in the garage longer than
&gt; its been on the road. help
