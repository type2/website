Mechanic suggested that my clutch is not completely
releasing which I would tend not to notice in forward
gears (where synchronizers are your friend) but for
reverse, which has no synchronizer and in which I
was when this starting episode began, it might be
possible for me to have had the engine just enough
engaged with the transmission that the starter motor
hanging up could have been somehow connected to being
in reverse with the transmission slightly torqued up.  
I was on a hill and had left the bus in reverse so 
that I could stomp the clutch, start the bus, and 
back up directly.  Being on a hill I quite possibly
was slipping forward (the opposite of reverse and 
thus applying torque from the wheels) though I did
not notice that if indeed I was.
