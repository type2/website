Subject: Re: Pop-Top Question;67 

busboy_at_FreeMark.COM (Tom Humphreys) asked about feasibility
of putting a straight up type poptop (Riviera conversion) on a 
'73 bus. 

So I wrote:

Hmmm... Didn't someone post here 6-12 months ago about doing this?
I remember a post describing the process as a tremendous amount of
work. No, I remember now: they swapped an early '70's poptop for
a late '70's one. 

I posted a while ago inquiring about whether any '71 buses exist with these
Riviera poptops from ASI. No one said they had seen one, but people told
me about seeing them on earlier and later model buses, so I think they might
be out there somewhere.

I suspect it would be easier to buy a bus with the top you want than to 
install one on your current bus. But if you're willing to do the work,
it's probably do-able. 

Good luck and let us know how it goes,
Surfer Bob
