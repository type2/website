&gt;I am looking at a '76 Westy  w/ 2 liter Fuel injected.  It has
&gt;83k original in the original engine.  This appears to be true.
&gt;I ran a pre-purchase compression check as follows, and and I
&gt;am curious as to what my findings mean.  I warmed up the engine
&gt;for a good 10min. Pulled the plugs: they were black, but the
&gt;porcelain was brown.  Did six cranks on each cylinder.
&gt;The results in order were: #3:110,#4:120,#1:116,#2:120.

Looks good.

&gt;#3 seems to be the low baller, but what kind of shape am I in?

The variance isn't enough to worry about.  The 2-liter engines have
relatively low compression due to a 15cc dish in the piston.  If it runs
smoothly and accelerates like a 76 bus, you're in business.

&gt;I am assuming a valve job and tune up may clean this up a bit.
&gt;Any thoughts?  Should I steer clear of an 83k original motor?

No.

&gt;As a side note, my ghia motor 1600dp ran 140 all around w/ #3 at like
&gt;40, oil squirt did not raise it.  Is this a valve problem or a basket
&gt;case?

Valve problem.  Probably burnt exhaust valve or seat problem.
