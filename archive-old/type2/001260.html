I just received a shipment of rear cargo door seals for '68-79 busses, for
$29.95 each.  Previously the cheapest rear hatch seal you could get was
about 3 times that price.  These are Mexican seals and frankly are not as
good as the originals (more &quot;generic&quot; in shape than the intricately molded
and cornered VW seal, and also a softer/spongier rubber), so if you're
looking for best quality I can still get you genuine VW ones for $99.  But
if your hatch seal is shot and $100 is out of your budget, there is finally
an inexpensive solution.  Price reflects a $10 list member discount, so if
you order via the website, please specify in the comments section of the
order form that you're a list member and the $10 will be manually deducted
when I process your order.

Also I received a small quantity of '72-up Genuine VW Brand rear wheel
cylinders, at $19.95 each, which is about half the going rate for the &quot;good
stuff.&quot;  Also on the website.

Finally, I do some remaining N.O.S. German parts left from my last overseas
purchase, although quantities are dwindling:

2 genuine VW retractable side steps, $249 ea (retracts automatically when
you close the sliding door)
3 sets of genuine VW fog lights, $99/pr
'68-71 German heat exchangers $189/pr
'72-74 Right hand heat exchangers, $149 ea
&quot;Accordian tubes&quot; that go from heat exchanger forward to body, $19.95 ea
Complete Exhaust System (everything behind heat exchangers), all German,
68-71 bus $99.95
As above for '72-74 bus ('79-83 sans cat &amp; egr), German stainless steel
(Brazilian tailpipe) $189.95
German O.E.M. brake shoes for all years $29.95/set; pads $19.95/set. (New,
not resurfaced!)
See my previous post or the website for more info (or call/email).
