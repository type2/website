Subject: Re: FW: [T2] S boot redesign

&gt;I am missing my S boot for a 80 westy , I am toying with the idea of
&gt;making one out of rigid copper pipe like what is used in commercial
&gt;plumbing.

	While you're about it, ask the pipe supplier about varieties 
of &quot;rigid copper pipe&quot; (semi-soft, etc) and make one out of each 
variety so that when one work-hardens &amp; cracks you can log the 
mileage it achieved and then try the next sub-type.
