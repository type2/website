Hello!

     I'm trying to get my heater going but my Heater Relay is shot, Part
# 211 963 135, Does anyone have a good one, or know where I can find one
at? Also the Temp. Regulating Switch/Timer Switch, Part # 411 963 107c,
maybe no good, the timer part is broken, but unknown if it will just
turn on the heater, and turn it off. 

     The lady I bought the heater from said they ran it 6 hours before
they pulled it out, but there is no way it has been ran for years. 

     A little off topic, but a friend has a Stewart Warner/Southwind gas
heater for a bug, were trying to find a manual, for it so we can install
it for him. Does anyone have a manual, or know where to get one? Even a
copy would be great.

Any and all help would be great.

Thanks,
Shawn Reed
