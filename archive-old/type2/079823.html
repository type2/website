Subject: Re: [T2] Transmission (engine swaps)

And here's a guy who uses the vw tranny w/ a V8. It's
not a stock tranny, though.

Kennedy Engineered is the source for adapters and
great tech support.  Hobart is the man with the
knowledge.  http://www.kennedyeng_dot_com/

I've always wondered, if you really need 150-200 hp,
why not by an astro?  They're cheap and everywhere. 
Lots of clubs to support them.  No need to fabricate a
radiator or to beef up the tranny (or install a 930
tranny).  Funny thing is the Astro guys are always
pulling there V6 and sticking a 350 in them.  I guess
going fast isn't my thing.

&gt; How much power can the Bus tranny put up with on a
&gt; regular basis?
