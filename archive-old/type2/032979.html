Hi All
I met Dawn just after her move to New Mexico.  She is a great Gal!
all the folks at the Buses by the Balloons had great things to say about
her!
Well.. If first impressions mean anything,,  I think she is Cool!
I can't speak from experience, I havn't bought anything,,, but I did see
some of her work!
She has fine work.  My wife is a perfectionist at sewing,,,, I think that
Dawn has the same qualities,,, just my humble opinion
I only met her for a couple of days at a campout, .....
I noticed she pays alot of attention to the uniformity to her stitches,, and
the quality of the material...
other than that , this is just my  superficial look at life
one other thing I can add,,,, When you move, things get re-prioritized,,,
then back to normal..
hmmmm,,, come to think of it,, I never got back to normal!

&gt;All listees:
&gt;
&gt;I thought I'd weigh in with my experiences with Dawn and PLF.  I've found
&gt;Dawn and the folks at PLF to be highly trustworthy, their products of top
&gt;quality and their prices very reasonable.  A few months back I was looking
&gt;for a new spare tire cover for my '79 westy.  I had to send my old one in
&gt;(on faith) so that they could use it as a template.  It took several weeks,
&gt;but I received a new cover that was of much better quality and workmanship
&gt;than my original.  My brother Ed also ordered and received a lovely new
&gt;orange poptop canvas for his '74 and it was also of top quality.
&gt;
&gt;I guess that my point here is that we need more people like Dawn and PLF to
&gt;keep our busses alive.  I think &quot;the benefit of the doubt&quot; might be in
&gt;order here to let some things work themselves out.
&gt;
&gt;Just my 2 piasters worth.
