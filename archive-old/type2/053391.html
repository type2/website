Subject: cooling system for 78 Westy

My &quot;significant other&quot; insists that I don't need all the cooling tins; he 
suggests mounting fans in the engine compartment would keep the engine cool 
and help the hot air exit out of the compartment.

I'm a newbie at doing my own VW mechanicking (sp???), but have read enough 
about how &quot;drives a VW&quot; and how &quot;operates a VW&quot; to disagree with him.

Can I get some other input on this subject???

Thanks.
