Subject: Re: [T2] Re: Wind Shield - Window Removal

Hi John,

That's the point... once you know the trick it's a piece of cake to  
do one. Really. But even the pros crack one now and then.

That's the reason they price windshields so high: because the  
installers still break one now and then, and they need enough markup  
to keep them profitable.

&gt; I had the windshield replaced in my 78 because of a crack in the

&gt; under the rubber and popped the window right out - they used the  
&gt; string technique to reuse the old seal and popped the new one back  
&gt; in - no problem ... took 20 mins.


Happy trails,
