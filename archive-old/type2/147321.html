Subject: [T2] RE: adding a light to my engine compartment

Hi!  I added two lights, one on each side of the engine.   I mounted the 
to the main bar/tube right up and to the inside of the batteries (if 
that makes any sense?) The lights are wired and fused off the main 
battery and are interior type lights sold at FLAPs.   The lights work 
well and are always there waiting for me to turn them on so they can 
brighten up the engine compartment.  I also painted the engine 
compartment white.
