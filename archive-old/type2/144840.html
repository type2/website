Subject: Re: [T2] bustedbus

Dan and all,

 

thanks for keeping tabs on BustedBus and SORRY for the delay in my arrival.  Joe had some issues keeping him from being in the shop everyday so returned calls are slow.  The shope was emptied and remodeled as well.  I was in vacation in Hawaii (I know, boo-hoo!) and now I'm in So-Cal packing.  We will arrive in Boulder on Saturday so I'll be back at the shop starting next week.

Thanks for the safe wishes, I hope the roads are nice and clear for our travels!

 

The domain name IS currently in transistion in order to switch hosts.  The current host is delaying releasing it. AAAARRRRGGG......good thing I'm switching!  Until then, Billy was right, email us...

 

Karl, thanks for passing on the parts_at_bustedbus_dot_com email.  that IS the permanent one but since the domain is in transition, use our temporary email: bustedbus_at_gmail_dot_com  for all parts inquiries.  I promise we'll get back to every response.

 

Again, thanks for the wishes.  I hope the drive is fun.  I hope the bus trailers well.  I look forward to serving all our needs very soon!

 

-Chris
