Subject: Texas Events - Repost

There are a few VW events going on here in Texas if your schedule allows
for some fun.

Bugswarm is in the south parking lot of the Ballpark At Arlington Sept.
15.(15 Miles from Dallas 15 miles or from Fort Worth)  There may be
another all-make swap meet going on in the west parking lot at the same
time.  The Ennis TX event is the biggest VW swap meet and show in the
region.  It's at the Texas Motorplex racetrack just west of Ennis on Hwy
287.  (41 Miles from Dallas) It's Sept 23.  These are both great VW
events that I've attended for years.  Bugswarm is a really great VW show,
as is Ennis.  If you can make them, you'll enjoy yourself.
