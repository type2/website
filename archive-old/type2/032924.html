Subject: any ideas?

My wife and I were driving our 78 bus back from Chicago today and a
weird thing happened.  The bus ran really smooth the entire way up there
and really well on the way back, until...  About 30 miles away from home
(Champaign/Urbana) the bus started to lug.  It was kinda like running
out of gas, but we had plenty.  It only happened for a second and then
everything was back to normal.  It happened so quick that I dismissed it
because I was not even sure if it was something in the engine or a big
gust of wind or what.  Everything was fine until we slowed down to get
off the highway.  When I down-shifted into 3rd the same thing happened
again.  We were about a mile away from home so we decided to just take
it slow and get home.  We made it home fine, but we had to stop at a
light once and the same thing happened in 1st, 2nd, and a wee bit in
3rd.  At first I thought the tranny was slipping or something but I
don't think this is the case.  When the lugging happened it was not like
the clutch was pushed in with an increase in RPM's.  It was just like
running real strong then lug lug lug then run real strong again.  Any
Ideas?

Thanks
Sean and Michelle
