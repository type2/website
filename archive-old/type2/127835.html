to get a $5 tag to cover me in New  Mexico, but what
good is that going to do me on the rest of my trip
back to &lt;&lt;

Pull a current plate off of one of your other cars at
home. If you get pulled over, tell the cop that you
just bought the bus and will be transferrring that tag
to the bus as soon as you get home...  OR seal the
deal with a payment and title transfer through the
mail BEFORE you fly out, once you have the title
signed over to you, you should be able to get a 30 day
tag in your home state.
