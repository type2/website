!!!!!!   $115/hour  !!!!!!

I am sure now that I am in the wrong business!

I figure about 40hrs in my new headliner(it does look good)...would be
about $4600 for labor charges alone!

WOW

Cheers, dave

&gt; What really surprised me last week was I discovered that they still service
&gt; air-cooled VWs. I don't know how well known it is but I caught them working
&gt; on an old beetle in their service bays and after asking around it seems they
&gt; have a mechanic who has been with them for 18 years and loves working on
&gt; them. Too bad their labor rate is $115/hr.
