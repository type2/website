REALLY Good question! Find out if it's got a hole in a cylinder (valve fried and became projectile into case). If it does, bet on a new engine; be happy if you get by with just a rebuild...but don't expect it.

Really hard to deal with family without someone getting the short end of the deal.

BTW, saw another '72 Riviera here in Memphis today. Really nice, straight bus. Once you know what to look for, they're pretty easy to spot.

Good luck! Joe
