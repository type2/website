&lt;&lt;  After a few minutes to relax I'll start
seeing if any of the FLAPS around here have a clutch cable (and hope
that's it). With any luck the wife will show up with the Volvo to go
get said cable and see if I can install it in the dark.

Good times.

You only &quot;need&quot; a clutch to go from a dead stop, and even then it
can be done. Turn the engine off, put it in 1st gear and give it a
little gas pedal when you turn the key to start. The bus will jerk
a little but if it's in good tune, it'll start and run.
