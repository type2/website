&gt;      No, unlucky you -- you'll probably never get a VW set of wires anywhere

The most recent set are Bosch. Have a place up here called Halsey Import
Automotive, they seem to be pretty good, they specialize in VW parts
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; wires. After I replaced the plugs and wires, it didn't have as much power,
&gt; &gt; would lose speed badly on hills.
&gt;       Sounds like you misplaced the wires, a common thing --- even if you did

Heh, yes, in fact I did at one point, have the wires messed up. I didn't
even bother mentioning it, I got it straightened out right away, in very
much the manner that you mentioned. This isn't nearly as extreme as that.
When the wires were on wrong, it would hardly go at all. This is just a
minor loss of power. When I brought her home, she'd zip up all but the
worst hills at 55-60. Now I'm lucky if I can get 45 up a small hill. I
can't drive her on the freeway, but we do fine around town. When I had #1
and #2 reversed, I couldn't get anywhere at all.

&gt;        Maybe someone put hydraulic lifters in it???? Probably not, but maybe.
&gt; 
So, what would happen if I had hydraulic lifters, and I'd adjusted them to
.006, because I didn't KNOW they were hydraulics?
&gt; 
&gt;       No, it should be closer to 10BTDC. At least 7.5BTDC. The 009 dizzy really
&gt; does best at 10

Set it to where it was happiest by ear, once we got it running, and it did
end up right around 10.
&gt; 
&gt;             275 isn't extremely hot, and you're never going to see 125-158,
&gt; more likely 200-225 or 250 normal running.
&gt; 
Really!? Wow, that's good to know! &lt;smile&gt; Uh, can I get a second opinion
on that? I was under the impression that the oil would start to degrade
over 230... &gt; 
&gt; 
&gt;      Nowhere do you mention doing a compression test -- after the overheating
&gt; and vacuum leaks, etc, you really need to do one --

Compression test has happened twice. I don't have the figures in front of
me, but as I recall, #1 and #3 were 125# and #4 was 100#. This was
consistant between the first and second test. The first time, #2 tested a
little lower. The second time, we couldn't get the tester to screw into
the hole. I had help for once, and he tried for half an hour, then I tried
for about 10 minutes, and then he tried for a while longer. Then we gave
up, because the sun was starting to set, it was dark and cold and he
wanted to go home. I guess I could pick up one of the kind that you just
hold in, but I've heard they were less reliable.

The newest bit of fun, was that when he pulled off the valve cover to
check the valve adjustment, it was leaking quite a bit of oil from the
passenger (#1/#2 cylinder) side. 

&gt;      One bit of advice -- quit replacing parts, find out what the actual
&gt; problem is before replacing anything. Diagnosis by parts replacement is not

That's a really good idea, but it can be a little harder to do when you
don't have any help, and you don't know what you're doing. My housemate's
response to anything I try to do with my bus, is to tell me I should 'just
get a real car', I can't even ask him to turn the key for me. It seems
like every time I take it to a mechanic, they charge me an arm and a leg,
and break as much as they fix. I think I need to invest in one of those
remote starter mechanisms, so I can start it from the back when I need to.
And as I keep replacing parts, I'm learning more about it, and at least i
know the history of the parts that way! 

Thanks for your help,
Kate
