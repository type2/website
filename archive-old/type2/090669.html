Subject: 1978 T2 buying reply

Thanks all for the advice on the 1978 I'm looking at.
I guess I should go ahead with the compression test,
the only thing is I already put 400 down on it and not
sure how much the guy is going to like it if I go test
it now. The total asking price is 800 and he's
throwing in an engine out of a '79. Makes me think he
just wants to lose the thing or I'm overlooking
something important and thereby gettting ripped off.
Anyway live and learn I guess. Anymore advice is
welcome. 
Thanks, peace, 
Giles
