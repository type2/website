&gt; What other reasons are there?  As far as I know the output of the O2 sensor
&gt; is directly related to air/fuel ratios and graphs of this relationship are

&gt; sensor besides the air/fuel ratio?

Bad o2 sensor, bad wiring to o2 sensor, o2 sensor not at operating
temperature, misreading voltmeter, bad voltmeter. There are probably others.

The only thing putting the voltmeter on the sensor tells you for sure is if
the sensor is operational or not. Now, that said, on my '79 CA bus I have an
AutoMeter A/F gauge attached to the o2 sensor output. But I don't use it for
baseline tuning. I have verified the functioning of the gauge with an
exhaust gas analyzer and it is pretty accurate in fact, but I would not be
comfortable using only the o2 sensor and a voltmeter to measure the A/F
ratio, i just don't feel it is precise enough.
