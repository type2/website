Subject: Re: [T2] Painting wheels with POR

Off topic:

***** chamfer*****

I know this is spelled correctly. How do you pronounce it. Do not cheat with 
the Webster's. I have heard it pronounced several ways two most popular are:

a. chanfer - like champion

b. chamfer - like chameleon, chamomile

Survey says....

Thanks for taking my survey. There were no prises, giveaways, exotic 
vacations, credit card promotions, free donkeys or monkeys associated with 
the creation of this survey or for the correct answer given by the surveyee. 
Thanks.
