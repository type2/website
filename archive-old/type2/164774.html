Subject: Ion channel  &quot;Killer Wave&quot;

I'm watching a rather long (4 hr) movie titled &quot;Killer Wave&quot; on the ion
channel.  Very long story about home-grown terrorists creating tsunamis on
the east coast of the US.

One character owns a bay.  At the moment it's prominently featured in the
movie as the main characters are escaping form the evil forces.

It's a robin egg's blue on red (or dark orange).  Um... That's a blue roof
and red (or orange) body.  Has a roof rack, louvered windows in the sliding
door and on the driver's side center of the bus.  Some hippie graffiti on
the bus and in the windows, round fog lights on the front bumper, weird
yellow stickers or lights just below the vent on the front, front-mounted
spare.

Any chance it belongs to a list member?

- Mike
