Higher octance gasoline does not have a higher energy content!  The BTU value
of gasoline does not significantly vary from grade to grade.  Octane is a
measure of the fuel's ability to resist pre-ignition.  Octane boosters slow
the burning process, they do not add any &quot;energy&quot; to the fuel.
