Subject: Price for '71?

I've really enjoyed the list and being a loaf owner but I'm afraid I may
have to get out of the bus ownership business.

The '71 loaf runs great. Still single carb. Tires (Yokohamas) are good. body
damage never fixed includes a bashed left rear quarter panel. I have the
light parts but not installed. Right rear crease above wheel well.

Includes recovered front seats and &quot;Z-bed in back. No other back seats or
camping stuff. Just 2 seat belts for the Zbed seat. Very simple and clean.

Does anyone have any idea what I should ask for this jewel in the rough? It
would be a great project for someone. No rust. Good mechanicals.

Thanks in advance.
Joel in Denver
