Subject: Re: [T2] Type 1 engine into a Type 4 bus

Hmm, I paid 149 for 94mm P&amp;C's, got a forged CW 69mm crank for 125, case machined and heads machined for 90. Did the valves myself, and the build. Second time around the crank only needed polishing. While I had it apart, I added an Engle 110 cam and dual Kads. Now mind you this is in a 70 Bug, but there would be little difference, except maybe find a engle 100 cam for a little less duration and more torque.
BTW, cheapest prices I ever find are dealers on thesamba_dot_com

Happy to chat about this any time. :-)

 Man, you must have a killer hookup for T1 engine parts.  The T4 2L 
 in 
 my Bus
 cost $1600 for a longblock.  By comparison, the T1 engine being 
 built 
 in the garage
 is already up to the $600 mark, needs heads, and is only a stocker 
 1600.
