&gt;Volks got my 78 sniffed today and it failed the HC part (passed everything

&gt;
&gt;     HC = 1518 (standard 430)  CO = 0.84  CO2 = 13.65

That's pretty lean!

BTW, What state are you in?

&gt;what's the best way to get the HC down without driving the other too
&gt;high??
&gt;
&gt;is high HC lean or rich, can never remember???

This is a good resource I located to explain gas analyzer readings. I hope it can help.
