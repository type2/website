Subject: ba6 heater and the 55 amp alternator.

I was offered a BA-6 gas heater a week ago at an insanely inexpensive
price. I bought it, but am now concerned about maxing out the available
amperage from the stock 55 amp alternator.

What do y'all think? Do I need to upgrade the alternator if I install
the BA-6?

Has anyone grafted a BA-6 into his or her bus heat system using the 55amp
alternator? How often did you use the heater? What kinds of results did
you see?

I think Richard or someone else mentioned the NLA status of the 70 amp
alternators earlier this week. Does anyone have a source for 70 amp
alternators at which I can be pointed?

Many thanks in advance for your thoughts,

jack
