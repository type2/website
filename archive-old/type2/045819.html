The Bentley gives you the amp hour spec. Put in an Interstate Group 41 for
great capacity and nationwide warrenty at many sources in many towns.
Replace the main cables complete if they are foul. And keep the terminals
and the battery clean so they don't get foul again from dirt and acid
creeping across the top. It is the no. 1 cause of stressed out alternators,
fried regulators and short lived batteries leading assuredly to NO START.
