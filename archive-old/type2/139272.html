Subject: Cleaning without plumbing

After my last stint at engine repair, which left the beige carpet , 
uhm, not beige, my wife banished auto parts from interior spaces. It's 
pretty clear she means it.

Don't have beige carpet anymore, and I have a garage for this kind of 
work. But no plumbing. Not even a drain. So I was puzzled about how I 
was going to get parts clean.

Here's what I did: I got one of those $20 laundry tubs from home depot, 
one of their orange logo buckets, and a 30 gallon rubbermaid trashcan. 
I place the orange bucket under the drain opening, and a stool in front 
to save my back. The beauty of this is that the bitty drops of grease 
and soap don't go flying all over the place -- and me. They stay in the 
tub.

I fill the 30 gallon can with water from the garden hose. That's my 
rinse. It needs to be changed every day or two. It's big enough that 
you can dunk a full engine case half (without studs) in and swish 
around. A case with studs would require a bigger can.

I empty it out by transferring portions into the orange bucket, 
carefully carrying that into the house, and dumping it into the toilet. 
Don't want to poison the dolphins.

When the parts are shiny clean, I sneak them into the house for a final 
rinse, then back out to the compressor to blow them dry.

Sounds simple and obvious, but it took me a while to figure it out. So 
maybe this will save some list members that time.
