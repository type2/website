Subject: An odd book I own...


&gt;I acquired a box of Volkswagen related literature and in the box was
&gt;this book. I would appreciate any information on its usefulness or
&gt;rarity.
&gt;
&gt;It is about 14 inches by 8 inches, hard cover, held together with two
&gt;brass screws (the pages) , navy blue, all in German, it appears to be a
&gt;repair manual of some sort. On the front it
&gt;reads...Dienst.....Reparatur-Leitfaden...VW-Personenwagen 1952/54.
&gt;
&gt;It has tons of pictures of early splits and it is in excellent
&gt;condition.Any ideas?
