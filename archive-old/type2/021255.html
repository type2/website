Subject: Canoe Rack follow-up

Volks:

I've had several responses to my post about the quick-n-easy brackets. 
I thought I'd go ahead and post the measurements for those interested.

Front Rack:

79 3/4&quot; Long. Bolt holes at 15 1/2&quot; from 1 end and 2 1/4&quot; from the
other.

Rear Rack:

66 3/4&quot; Long.  Bolt holes at 2 1/4&quot; from each end.

I mount the front with the extension over the drivers door.  This allows
me to see if it clears the tree I park under:-) AND it doesn't get in
the way of the sliding door.  Also, I should note:

1- It took 2 2x4 blocks and about 3/8&quot; stack of washers on each side to
make the crossbar clear the pop-top on the front due the curvature of
the roof.  Mine is a 71.  Your vehicle may vary. Rear only has the 2
spacer blocks.  I screwed the spacers together and to the crossbar using
sheet rock screws.

2- I counter sunk the bolt head in the crossbar so that the canoes will
slide into position without catching.

Remember, these measurements are for using the brackets backwards
(curving away from the pop-top).  I've been really happy with this
setup.

Hope this helps someone.
