&gt;Subject: [T2] Possible single cab and Computer Gurus Help!
&gt;
&gt;Hi Volks,
&gt;
&gt;I'm pretty excited about the possibility of adding a 1969 single cab to
&gt;my bus herd.
&gt;I will be looking at it either Tuesday or Wednesday.  Any particulars
&gt;that I need to look for?  I know the areas where to look for rust, any
&gt;place special for a single cab?  


 Single &amp; double cabs are buggers for rusting out the floor and adjacent
 areas under the tray bed.
 Water gets down there as the tray bed gets beat up over the years,seams
 split,the wooden strips dissappear and the rivet holes remain unplugged 
 and so on.Water always finds its way there.
 Many owners never bothered to check for this and water can sit under there
 for ages ultimately destroying another of this rare breed.

 Check the floor carefully by sticking your head inside thru the side
 cargo hatch and pay special attention to the right hand side (on a LHD
 vehicle) as this is where the water will pool when parked on the street
 as it leans with the fall of the road towards the gutter.
 Check also the lower sides of the vehicle in this area just in front
 of the rear wheels on both the outer &amp; inner sides of the sills for
 either dodgey previous repairs or rust waiting to break thru.
 Check if the drain holes here are clear too.
 The area where the tray meets the back of the cabin is also vunerable.

 Of course there's also the typical spots around the front wheel wells,
 under the door step,under the windscreen,battery tray etc. that any Type 2
 can rust as well.
 But with respect to the Pritchenwagons (pickups), I've more often seen
 killer rust starting on the floor under the tray and then progressing to 
 eating out the chassis rails as well if left unchecked.
 By this stage they are often beyond a feasable restoration project unless
 money &amp; time are simply no object...

 Good luck with the '69,you'll love driving one of the pickups but do
 check carefully first to save a lot of heartache later on.
 They are more at risk than the busses due to their design.

 Cheers,
