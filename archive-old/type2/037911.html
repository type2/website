Subject: Need photos for list-sticker (round 2)...

Hey Folks,

I don't know if it's from the recent problems with the
list, or from lack of interest (God, I hope not), but
I only recieved *3* responses to my last query!!!
*NOT* good.

For those who might not have recieved my last post
(and therefore, have absolutely no idea what I'm
talking about;-), I will re-iterate what I'm looking
for:

A fellow listee and I are working on a new Type2_dot_com
list sticker. I'm doing the artwork; he's going to do
the actual printing/distribution. If this
collaboration doesn't work out for some reason, I will
buy the equipment and print them myself(but only if
there is sufficient interest from you guys..hint,
hint;-).

The artwork will feature a splitty 23-window (maybe a
barndoor?), a loaf Westy, and an A/C Vanagon, side by
side, with the type2_dot_com logo beneath them. I call it
the &quot;Generations&quot; theme; it *should* appeal to all bus
owners, as all of the major body styles will be
represented (except the Eurovan, which is only
marginally a bus, at best ;-).

So...I need pics of a splitty and a Vanagon in *both*
front and passenger-side 3/4 views. They must be saved
in .jpg format, so I can re-size them. If someone has
a photo of all three busses in that order (splitty,
loaf, Vanagon, left to right), that would be GREAT, as
the angles would be right, saving me a *lot* of work.

I currently have some pics of a splitty and a Vanagon
that I might be able to use, but I'd really like a few
more options to choose from. I have a '69 Westy, so I
can get a pic from any angle I need, there.


So....how about it, folks? Please tell me that I'm not
wasting my time, here...this has already been a lot of
work, and I want something to show for it.
