Trust us instead ;)

&gt; tested most of it and it checked out, haven't gotten to a few things that
&gt; really shouldn't matter (guages etc)   didn't have any wires, went to

Ok, when I'm talking about the wiring harness, I'm referring 
specifically to the ljet harness, not anything else.


&gt;&gt; Something is strange about the fact that it runs 5 minutes and then
&gt;&gt; dies.  Did you check if you still had good spark after it died?  Did you
&gt; 
&gt; yes it still had decent spark

at all plugs?

&gt;&gt; try starter fluid after it died?  If, after it died and starter fluid
&gt;&gt; doesn't get it running again, I'd venture to guess the problem is an
&gt; 
&gt; starter fluid didn't get it started.

This is the strange part.  If fluid didn't get it started, then that 
means there's no spark, or poor spark.  Rationale here being that we 
should be able to get the car to start without EFI just using starter 
fluid, so that would lead me to believe that the problem is a spark issue.

&gt; 
&gt; I'll bribe you to pay a visit to Baltimore??!?!?!?!

haha.. I would.. but I'm in Cali.. a bit of a drive ;)
