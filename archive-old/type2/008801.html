Hi Jaimie,
I too live about 5500' elevation and tried a 1641.  I constantly overheated,
engine only lasted about 40,000 miles and really didn't have any more power.
Still like the 1600, but might try some machine-in 88's so i can have a
whopping 1700 (and thicker cylinder walls)
    In short, I would never go the 1641 route again, but maybe I was just
unlucky...
Paul
