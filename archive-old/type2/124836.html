Subject: Re: [T2] Small Town Terrorist Leads to Listee Bus Sighting

From: &quot;Michael Knight&quot; &lt;vwdormer_at_hotmail_dot_com&gt;
&gt; ... He was digging through my garbage...

I'm afraid to ask, but why was he digging through your garbage?

&gt; ... Now I live next door...

As in right next to your old landlord?  The next lot over?

&gt; ... The reporter tried to insinuate that for the love of my bus and the
grudge against the landlord that I could have been doing this as a means to
really scare the Bajesus out of him. All though that would have made a
better story it wasn't the case...

Wish I could have been there to see his face when he uncovered that practice
claymore.  I wonder if the &quot;This side toward enemy&quot; printed on the front of
the claymore was facing up when he moved the banana peels? :O)

Bus content: Glad to hear that you were able to get your bus on the news.
Very cool.
