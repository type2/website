Subject: killer gas fumes/smell

i recently bought myself a 72 westy, and ever since i
got it it has the strongest smell of gas i've ever smelled 
in any vdub. it is about as strong as stinking your nose 
in a jerry can and breathing for a couple minutes. its so 
bad it burns my nostrols when i breath.
the smell has it's peak for about three days after i fill
up.so i started just filling up my westy with a hlf tank
to keep the fumes down, but even this doesn't help that 
much. so if anyone would kindly give input, it would be 
awsome.

just want to say thanks for the re:'s on my choke adjustment
plee.

'72 westy

happy driving
