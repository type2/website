The Beetle is still produced at VW de Mexico's plant in the state of =
Puebla, southeast of Mexico City. You can arrange a tour of the factory. =
View the old Beetle online (it's called the Sedan):

www.vw_dot_com.mx

Current price in Mexico is 74,240 pesos or 7,424 dollars, at current =
exchange rates (10 to 1).

Here are some of the Beetle's specs:

Engine:
4 cylinder, air cooled
1,584 cc
40 HP (DIN) _at_ 4,000 RPM
Torque (DIN): 97 Nm _at_ 2,200 RPM
electronic fuel injection
oil filter
hydraulic lifters
3-way catalytic converter
front disc brakes
burglar alarm
four-speed manual transmission


I've seen a number of gray-market Mexican Beetles driving around New =
Mexico and Texas.

VW de Mexico sells the Eurovan in Mexico; the Kombi (Baywindow bus) is =
no longer officially available there.

The bus, or Kombi, is produced only in Brazil now (in the western =
hemisphere, anyway; it may be being produced still in South Africa).

If only I had a cooperative DOT and enough $$$.

&gt;Might be coming out of Brazil, where they must be still made---
&gt;In the VW Campers Magazine there are ads all over the place for &quot;New&quot;
&gt;Type 2 Buses of any flavor as well as the old style Bugs--
