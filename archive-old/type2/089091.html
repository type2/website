&gt; 1. Karl, how about those MB partnumbers?
&gt;
&gt; 112-476-12-26 for 10MM?
&gt;
&gt; what is the 7MM?

Should be 7.5mm. MB part # 916030 000527


&gt; 2. The guy has described the new hose as being plastic and shiny. That
doesn't sound like rubber to me. What's up?

Huh?  No way. I have no idea what he is trying to sell you.

&gt; 3. I told him 1 meter of the 7MM, is that enough?

For a FI bus? No, not enough. A meter is only 39 1/4&quot; long. That is about what
you need to go from the tank to the filter alone. Then it depends if you have
steel tubing on each side of the cold start valve. If yes, then 2 meters
should do it. If no, then figure 3 meters. Do NOT use worm drive clamps,
i.e.Gates, they cut thru the hose! Use the original VW or MB clamps.
