Subject: Brown wire to generator?

'71 Bus
Installed rebuilt Bosch 30A generator
The new generator has just two connectors, on top at the rear, near the
pulley.  I reconnected the red and green wires there, as they were
connected to the old generator.
 
The old generator had a third connection (also on top but towards the
front, closer to the fan housing).  The brown wire was connected to this
third terminal on the old generator, but there's no such third terminal
on the new one.
 
Anyone know what this third wire is, and where should it go in the
absence of a third terminal on the generator?  The Bus runs fine without
it connected (and the generator light turns off after starting), but it
must have some purpose... right?
 
Thanks,
 
- Miles
