&gt; This isn't strictly bus related, but I figure you guys are the most likely

&gt; California?  A friend of mine is thinking of moving there, and I'm unsure
&gt; if his car (bought in Washington state) will pass California emissions
&gt; standards or not.  Can you bring in a Federal car, or do you *have* to buy
&gt; a California emissions model upon moving into the state?
&gt; 
&gt; I'm in Michigan, so I'm a bit hazy on the whole thing.  California is like
&gt; a different country to me.
&gt; 

   If the car is not california emissions ready, at it has to say so on
the sticker under the hood, you have to pay a one time $300+ dollar
fee.  When I brought my car from hawaii the dmv people came at
personally checked for the sticker and the words &quot;california emmissions&quot;
on the sticker.  Most of the words were smudged but luckily those
weren't and it saved me some dough.  You still have to pass the smog
test on top of that.
