Subject: Re: [T2] '76 FI engine?

You should be able to tell quickly by popping a valve cover, and looking at
the pushrods.

Hydraulic pushrods are more or less pencil thick, where as the older solid
type are about 3/8 thick not to mention that both are made of different
material..........

&gt; Hello all listees, how would I tell what my engine is?  A few weeks back,
&gt; (no flames here pls. ;) while driving on the highway I noticed white smoke
&gt; pouring out the back of my bus.  Well, dumbass am I, I forgot to torque my
&gt; oil drain nut enough so it wouldn't shake loose, etc.  Well, it did &amp; was
&gt; lost on the highway along with a good deal of oil.  So there I was in
&gt; farmtown nowhere where no store had metric bolts, etc.
&gt; I found one eventually but it was not the fitting which was specified in
my
&gt; Bentley &amp; the mechanic's manuals.  How do I know if I have hydraulic
&gt; lifters?  I've inherited a '76 with 84K &amp; the engine's very strong &amp; makes
&gt; no clattering &amp; hasnt' had a valve adjustment to my knowledge &amp; according
to
&gt; paperwork in over 15K.
&gt;
&gt; Help anyone?
&gt;
&gt; Thank in advance listees.
