&gt;
&gt;According to my distributor no. and the chart in the
&gt;Type 2 archives, the DISTRIBUTOR should be timed to
&gt;zeroTDC with the vac line plugged.
********************
What's the distributor number?
********************
&gt;But when I checked the timing, it was somewhere before
&gt;TDC, because there's no extra notches, I estimate
&gt;about 7.5 degrees. The bus ran well and cool.
&gt;
&gt;And when I tuned it up recently, it seemed to run best
&gt;at this estimated 7.5.
&gt;
&gt;I'm confused. Is there a way to figure the correct
&gt;timing when the book data doesn't make sense?
************************
Timing is *usually* according to the distributor number, but there can be
other mitigating factors, such as wear and tear on the distributor unit
itself.  It is interesting to note that while there are 3 different timing
factors from 61-71, the lower distributor driveshaft &amp; brass timing gear
are the same, so it stands to reason that the distributor and the way it is
set up makes the difference when setting the timing.  As an example, I find
that my 84 Westy runs so much better at 0 TDC than the factory specified 5
degrees AFTER TDC, probably because the darn distributor is 18 years and
160,000 miles old.

Now I have a question - You state your crank pulley has only one notch - is
this notch on the &quot;thin&quot; flange portion of the pulley or is this notch
sorta like a &quot;u&quot; depression on the thick side flange of the pulley?

If the notch is on the thin side of the pulley, I'd be willing to bet the
notch is 5 degrees AFTER TDC.  Most any new replacement OE style pulley
these days are made this way and some come with that &quot;u&quot; depression on the
thick flange so you can find TDC.

If the notch or &quot;u&quot; depression is on the thick flange of the pulley, this
is most likely 0 or Top Dead Center.

The only way to know for sure is to pop the #1 spark plug off and use a
stick while rotating the crank while looking at the mark.  Once you know
where TDC is, then you can determine where your optimum timing is from there.
