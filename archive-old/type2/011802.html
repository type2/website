Hey volks,
I need a little direction for troubleshooting a problem that has developed 
as a result of a minor accident. I hit a deer a couple of weeks ago. Since 
then the EGR light has been on(no big deal) I've learned to have fun with 
bondo but most importantly there is a THUMP THUMP .. THUMP THUMP sound 
that increases with wheel rpm when i drive. I have looked under the front 
end and see no obvious problem. I don't have much choice but to figure it 
out with the help of the list. Most mechanics in this town won't even work 
on old vw busses. 

Thanks in advance for all the help.
