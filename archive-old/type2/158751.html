The glass should be all the same .. though with the other one-year-only
bits on a '68 it wouldn't surprise me if they were different.

I'm sure that's a Friday topic, but since it came up .. me, I'd say the
Portland, Oregon area is a contender.  Lots of Busses running around,
plenty of camping opportunities nearby, several specialty VW parts
shops .. and plenty of good beer.  :-)
