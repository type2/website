Subject: Another tire question

I hate to post another tire question, but I've been reading the threads and
have a question.  I am considering going with a set of 27x8.5x14 on my '74
camper.  I believe they will fit from the testimony of others on this list.
But I am concerned about the discussions on load rating though.  I'm looking
at the BFG A/T's which have a load rating of C and max load of 1515 _at_ 50psi
according to their web site.  Would this be acceptable for a bus?  Also, are
there any personal experiences with this or any similar tire in this size?
