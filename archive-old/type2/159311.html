Well, we saw the movie, hilarious ending, but and SO said it was giving 
&quot;our old busses a bad rap&quot;......
1. No headrests- so it must have been a 73 bus? When were headrests 
standard?  Since it was post 71 the headrest spaces would be there and 
any responsible parents should have used them- and BTW, I don't recall 
seatbelts being used?
2.  Mechanic tells them their clutch is gone, (and 1st, 2nd gear??) but 
they can push it and slip it into 3rd when rolling?  Since they can 
drive it ok, clutch must work- perhaps cable is shot?  But then gears 
should be ok- and instead of them DANGEROUSLY running after the bus and 
jumping in after it's rolling, why not just run it on the starter to get 
it going and then slip it into the gears?  Do any of the writers drive a 
manual shift?? If they wanted to contrive a family cooperative effort, 
then let the starter die and they push it just to start it, then driver 
can stop it ands wait for them to hop in!
3. The rear engine hatch was open- anyone notice that?
4. The horn sounding randomly- even when the engine is off? Isn't it 
tied to the ignition? Also- no one thought to pull a horn wire?
5. The door falling off- is that possible without a major hole in the 
track under the bottom roller or a complete &quot;dissassembly&quot; of the rear 
roller arm?  Presents &quot; these busses as unsafe&quot;....
