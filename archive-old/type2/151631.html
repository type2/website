Subject: Diodes and door buzzer

Ok, I've searched and searched and can't find the info I'm looking for.
I'm planning on installing a diode between my headlight switch and my new
door buzzer, so that if my headlights (parking lights actually) are on
when I open the door, the buzzer will go off. Question is, which diode?
I don't know much about electronics like diodes and transistors. The one I
bought from the &quot;Shack&quot; is rated at 50V, 3A. Will this work? All the other
ones they had were rated 200V or greater.

If I understand right, the 50V is the peak inverse voltage. So, if the
voltage at the cathode end is greater than 50V, then electrons will flow
backwards through the diode. Correct?  This shouldnt happen with a 12V
system.

I only see diodes rated at 1A or 3A. Will the 3A suffice?
