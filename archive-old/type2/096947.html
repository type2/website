Subject: Yellowstone, busses and bikes too

Clara,

Better yet, take a bike.  Start at Ashton, the last town in the Idaho
valley below West Yellowstone City.  You ride up a rail trail that is
for hikers, bicycles and four-wheelers.  I did it last year a week
before the 4th of July.  We were the only ones on the trail, clear to
West Yellowstone City.  From Ashton it follows the Warm River up the
canyon and onto the relatively flat and bus-friendly Island Park area, .
. . above that are the headwaters/springs of Henry's Fork of the Snake
River, a main tributary of the Columbia River.  Overnight, then up to
the continental divide and down into W Jellystone City.  Area is teaming
with wildlife.  W Jellystone usually has a hippy bus or two around.  Has
everytime I've been there.  From the city it is what, . . . 1/4 mile to
the entrance, and from there about 30 miles to Old Faithful and even
more busses in the summer.  Fun trip.

Best,

Curt

the summer after I got my 61 my exbf &amp; I took a road trip out to the
Rockies. 
 we went through Idaho to Yellowstone, and up to Jacksone Hole.   We
also 
went up the north side of Yellowstone, which is quite steep.  or was
that 
Glacier?    real nice pub out there.   I could be mixing up two trips
in 
consecutive summers.  anyway, very pretty area, and the bus didn't mind
the 
grades. (1600 sp, early 64 gearing) Definately recommend it for a bus
camping 
trip.  Why didn't you take the bus?

for steep grades- the pass north of Yosemite over the Sierras gets up
to 26%. 
 Don't be in much of a hurry over that one- lots of hairpin turns.

 I just returned from Jackson, Wyoming.  I saw quite a few buses there:
 
Splittys, Early Bays, a few late Bays, and Vanagons.  I was wondering
what 
it's like to drive the 20 or so miles from Jackson, Wyoming to Victor,
Idaho 
in a Bus.  Seems like it might be a bit of a challenge with the 8000 ft

elevation and the 10 percent grade.
 
 Anybody ever done this drive in a Bus?
