Okay,

Here's the situation.  I just bought a 78 Van that
probably hasn't been running since early summer and
the PO said that it did run, but would shut down after
about 10-15 minutes.  When I got it, I visually
checked that everything was hooked up (Note: Did not
have a serious look), put a battery in it and fired it
up.  It ran for about 10 seconds, shut down and then
would not fire again.  When I cranked it, it would
almost catch, but not quite.  

O do not have much experience with these FI systems
and am hoping you guys/gals might give me a head start
on what to look at first.  I do have spark, and I
would assume fuel.....Hmmm!

Thanks,

Sam
