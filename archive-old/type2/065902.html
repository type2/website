Subject: Splitty floor panels

Has anyone ever bought floor panels from Mill Supply? I got a left and
right and boy, are they thin!  Seems they are about 24 guage or thinner!
I called RMMW and Das Bulli Has and they say thats what they sell as
well.

Has anybody ever found any that are the standard 20 guage?
