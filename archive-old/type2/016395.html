Subject: Key locked in bus (Happy Ending)

Since it's Friday and there is a thread about keys locked in buses i'll
relay my Friday saga to you. I got to work this morning and, eager to
have a look under the bus to check out my exhaust, I locked my keys in
the bus, in the ignition no less. Within a half an hour the trusty CAA
road mechanic (Canadian equivelant to AAA) was pulling into the parking
lot here at work. It took him less than 15 minutes to break into my bus
and retrieve my keys for me. He used one of those little slim jim things
that slides right between the window and the seal.

He said normally they would be able to do it a lot quicker, but after
looking at the rubber around my windows he confessed that he wanted to
do it the long way so as not to damage 25 year old rubber. He asked a
lot of questions about the bus and told me about his friend with a late
60's bay window. Now I'm back at my desk reading my morning digests.
Anyway, it's friday and a potentially crappy experience was quickly
turned into a pleasant one because I got a cool mechanic who sacrificed
his time and his cold hands to protect my rubber.

Cheers,

Time to have that second key cut!
