X-Diagnostic: MESSAGE MAY NOT BE TOPICAL

I don't know if you have any kind of RV supply stores like we have here in
the states, but I would look into the tanks used on other camper/RV's. You
may be able to find a tank that has the right dimensions. It will all be
custom fit, but it will help if its close to the right size to start. The
fresh tank will have to have a small 12v pump to get the water out. The
waste tank will have to have a large valve to dump with. It sounds like a
workable thing to do. Keep in mind those tank will add a lot of weight when
full if they are real big. So plan accordingly.

Subject: [T2] Water tanks


I have been toying with the idea of fitting underfloor tanks for fresh and
waste water, to free up space inside the bus and save having to fetch and
empty constantly while camping where there are only basic (or no)
facilities (5 people can get through a lot of water).
I don't remember this being discussed on the list before, so I thought I
would ask your opinion on whether it was a good or bad idea.  Does anyone
have fixed tanks fitted to their bus?  What's the deal with filling them up
at campsites?  Do you just park near the tap and run a hose, and connect
another hose to empty?
