&gt;&lt;&lt;  It's Friday and I have to say something that is on my mind.  I don't think
&gt; it is fair to Ron &amp; Bus Depot, to air every complaint on here before the 
&gt; whole list.  &gt;&gt;

&gt;yet is it ok that ron has virtually free unlimited advertising on here??  you 
&gt;cant have one without the other.

You can have the opportunity to speak back, but don't use the list as your first
recourse.  This is important.  Bear with me, I begin to wax poeticabobble:

Publicly complaining to a wide range of possible customers (i.e. the list) about
a business (i.e. Bus Depot) is something that should be done *only* after you've
tried your hardest to settle the matter privately.  This is imperative; we have
here a wonderful means of communication and distribution of information... but
we also have a way to damage someone's business greatly.  

If you have a complaint with *any* parts supplier, including Bus Depot, the
first thing to do is call them and try to resolve the problem privately.  (Don't
e-mail.  Unless you've been in a business like that, you can't comprehend how
much e-mail pours in daily, hourly, by the bucketful per minute.  You'll never
get a reply in time if you e-mail, because they just can't sift through the
e-mail *and* get your orders out on time.)  

I've had many dealings with Bus Depot; in the few cases that I've been
unsatisfied with what I received, I called, and they were always courteous,
responsive, and went well out of their way to make certain I was satisfied. 
(*Way* out of their way.  Like calling around to find a replacement for a
defective rebuilt distributor, two years after I'd bought it, well past warranty
date.)  

(Ask K-Mart to do that when your lawnmower breaks.  I dare you.  In fact, let me
know before you try, 'cause I want to bring my camcorder and record it and send
it to that video show.  You know the one.  The one where all the people get
laughed at for beating themselves senseless... which is what'll happen if you
try it at K-Mart, except there's no $10,000 prize.  Such is life.  (And if you
*really* want to win the 10 grand, try it at GEX.  (And if that isn't enough
fun, try driving nails through a brick wall with your skull.  Whee!  (In any of
the above cases, I'll be there with the camcorder.  Just in case.))))


And geez, the phone call to Pennsylvania isn't *that* much that you have to send
an e-mail to the list instead of calling.  


(Note:  I know I'll get flak for that last comment.  I ain't suggesting you
didn't try to call first, I'm not defaming you and I'm not saying you're the
kind of person who'd whine to a whole group of people first instead of taking
care of your own problems, you're wonderful, you're peachy, I love you.  Smooch. 
I *know* you know how to deal with these things, it's all the *other* wierdos
out there.  Really.  May Yog-Sothoth strike me in the pancreas if I ain't
frothingly gibberingly madly in love with you.  So put down the meat cleaver and
smile, it's all okay.)  

If a business sends you bad merchandise (and I'm talking about defective, not
you-get-what-you-pay-for), and then refuses to help you out over the phone, (And
hh, *boy* have I had trouble with some other people (Not BD)) *then* it may be
time to complain to the list.  But don't use the list as your first recourse;
try to deal with the matter privately.  

At the very least, you're more likely to get actual *help* if you call them.  



Oh, and one more thing.  

I know, I know, &quot;siddown and shuddup.&quot;  I'll be brief.  I promise.  Um.  Really.  

When you call a parts distributor (like BD), it doesn't hurt to be polite.  No,
I mean *polite*.  Not sacharrine.  If you're pissed because the whatzit broke
and your knuckles are all skinned and someone in Brazil pocketed the money they
should have used to inspect the damned thing, then *wait* before you call. 
Drink some warm milk or something.  Chill.  If you call and rave and scream and
act like a disappointed patron of a Adam Sandler movie trying to get his or her
ticket back at Showcase Cinema, you are *not* going to get the best of service.  

Translated:  Suck up and be nice, punk.  You'll get better service and the
people on the other end will be a *heck* of a lot less stressed.  

Or you could rant and rave about it, I suppose.
