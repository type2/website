Subject: H4 Headlight upgrade

I would recommend this upgrade to just about everyone.  I love my H4's so
much that I still get a silly grin when talking about them.  And I've owned
them for years!  It must be the slight illegality of the whole thing.  ;-)
I do have the Hella's but I'm sure the knock-off would be pretty similar in
performance.  They have such a well designed reflector and lens that on low
beams there is zero light scatter up into oncoming drivers eyes.  It's for
this reason that you can use such bright bulbs in them.  I'm running the
100w brights / 80w dims and I can honestly say that no one has EVER
'flashed' me because my dims were too bright / out of alignment.  It's the
best lighting I've seen in any road car, bar none.

Go get 'em,
