&gt; Not my beetle jack!  The beetle jack I had was a design that walks a

That design stranded me once. It was freezing outside and the jack mechanism
kept slipping. I had to borrow a jack from a taxi and pay for his time while
he waited for me to have a tire changed.

The bus jack is better and the scissor jack, well even better!
