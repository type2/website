If the plastic part is on the contact face of the nut, it's a sealing nut
and the plastic should go against the part you're sealing.  I've only seen
them used on the oil pump, main case studs, and the hold-down nut that's
inside the fuel injection air plenum chamber on type I FI.  If the plastic
is on the inside of the nut, sorta like part of the threads, it's a lock
nut.
goforit!
