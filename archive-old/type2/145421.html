Subject: Re: [T2] Wretched Running Bus

Don't know if this helps, but I had a similar experience with my car and I was able to fix it pretty easily.

The problem with my Bus was... the fuel lines were soo old that it was actually sucking in air through the fuel line. It WAS pulling fuel through the lines and delivering it to the carburetor, but the lines were so old that they became prous. It literally sucked air through the lines. It was never getting enough fuel and it would basically take me like 10 minutes of flooring it just to get to about 55 miles an hour.

I replaced all the old &quot;fabric / rubber&quot; lines with steel lines, I can't remember what size fuel line, but I got something that had an exterior diameter of 3/8ths of an inch. The Bus ran EXCELLENT! And now I can easily get up to 70 miles an hour, although I don't typically drive over 60. The Bus has PLENTY of get up and go too...

Maybe that's your problem???  I didn't see the whole e-mail you posted, so if you covered this already, then I apologize.

&gt;If I gave it more throttle it stumbled, coughed,
&gt; hiccupped, half backfired (a subdued sound back fire, not a loud bang) and
&gt; bucked like a bull.
