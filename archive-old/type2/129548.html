Subject: Stick Brosol Chokes, solutions?

The last two 30/31s I got have sticky chokes. I am about to disable the 
present one, as I had to manual unstick the plate today to give my motor 
some needed air.
I had oiled the pivots, anyone know a trick to smooth these out or 
should I just kill the choke? Maybe more oil, or deburr the operating 
shaft and boss?
Thanks,
Al
