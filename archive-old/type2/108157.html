Subject: Re: [T2] Fuel Line Size, Please

Since I was thinking these lines were 8mm I ended up using 5/16&quot; ID
high-pressure hose which is .0025&quot; smaller than 8mm but .0345&quot; larger than
the 7mm ID hose that I'm now thinking is correct.  Since the hose that was
there has been there 22 years maybe I'll get the correct hose when I replace
it in 20 years or so!

&gt; --Tom,
&gt;
&gt; I used 7.5MM MB hose from the local euro-garage. I think 7MM is the OEM
spec, but try getting that on the fuel injectors!
&gt;
&gt; Check out the library, I have a writeup of my 75-79 baywindow fuel line
replacement with a parts list and other things to consider.
&gt;
&gt; High pressure hose remember!
&gt;

&gt;
&gt; &gt;I've dropped the gas tank of my air-cooled Vanagon and feel that I should
&gt; &gt;replace the short sections of fuel hose
