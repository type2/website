Subject: was valve moron

Well I think I have it solved ... for today.
I re-read Muir, I read the write up in the Library, and headed on down to
try again.  The 3/4 valves were giving me fits, first the # 4 intake was
holding up, the valve not closing, I got it to release then the same thing
happened to #3 intake.  The rocker arm was so tight against the valve
spring, just wouldn't release.  In a fit of rage, I left the locking nut
loose, and the adjuster loose, started it up and moved into the parking
space.
This morning, I started all over, did #1, rotate 180 counterclockwise, #2,
close it up and move on to #3.  Hmmmm, the pushrod is out o of the rocker
arm, sort of wedged under the rocker arm.  A little effort and I get it to
move, replace in the rocker arm, and begin to close the adjusting screw.
Now it looks better.
I finish the valve's and start it...very nice.  I ran maybe 30 miles today,
and feels good.
I have been warned to take out the push rod and inspect it...make sure it is
not bent, top prevent it from rubbing a hole in the push rod tube.  All
agree?	

Thank you to those that offered assistance.
