&gt; 
&gt; Budget to replace all your fuel lines with HIGH PRESSURE (30+ psi)
&gt; line
&gt; and the proper clamps, the FI in 76+83 run at 30+ psi.
&gt; 
&gt; Also figure that you ought to replace your fuel fill and vent necks.
&gt; 
&gt; Do it now before they crack, split, and leak!!!
&gt; 
&gt; Have fun!

I was wanting to do just that. I looked at the bus and I saw one line
&gt;from the tank to the pump, one from the pump to the first fuel
injector, four short ones on the injectors, two long ones from injector
rail to the cold start and to the other rail, and a return line to the
tank. Did I miss anything? 
How much fuel line will I need? (in feet)
What diameter is it? Is it all the same size? If not give both sizes
please.
I have a fire extinguisher, but hope to never need it. 
Thanks.
