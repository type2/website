&gt; Volks,
I purchased new shocks all the way around and started to install

&gt; other shock 
&gt; has no place to attach the device that holds the spring in place to
&gt; the 
&gt; shock.  I assume I have the wrong shocks or are these superstar
&gt; shocks and 
&gt; you dont need the spring???

Nope, stock VW shocks don't have springs on them.  What you had were a
set of &quot;booster&quot; shocks that were added as a band-aid solution to a
sagging rear end.  These shocks can be hard on the shock mounts, as
they aren't designed to carry support loads.

Put the new shocks on and see if the rear end is really sagging.  Park
the bus on a level surface and put a level in the sliding door opening.
 If the rear end is low, then you need to adjust the rear torsion bars
to restore the correct level.  See the archives and the Bentley manual
for lots of advice on this procedure.

BTW, some buses (such as my '71) have their inside mirrors located in
such a way that you cannot see the horizon through the rear window. 
This is normal, and you should resist the temptation to crank in a bit
of extra twist to lift the rear  of the bus.  To do so makes the
handling odd, the ride rough, and can damage the CV joints and boots.
