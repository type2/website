Subject: 70 or 71?

 I believe that you can tell the difference between a '70 and a '71
by the hubcaps.  If you have the dome type it is a '70.  The different
wheel and cap began in '71.(?)  I think I have a '70 parts van along with
a '69, and a '71   Someone out there with a '70...
    What kind of hubcaps does it have?
