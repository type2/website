Subject: Re: [T2] vac dizzy help on 71 1600 dp...

&gt; &gt;I've verified and reverified and rereverified again that they are going to
&gt; &gt;the right places. Wire above notch is going to #1  and the rest go counter
&gt; &gt;close wise 2,3,4 correct?
&gt;
&gt; 1-4-3-2 CCW is the order of the distributor wires starting from the rotor facing the notch on the body.

isnt it 1432 clockwise?

he said 1234 ccw afaik that is correct.

fyi if you have the wires reversed you can get the engine to run on 2 cyls
but it will have very little getup and no power and will stink like raw
gas no matter how you try to adjust it.
please dont ask how I know this. :)
