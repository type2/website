Subject: Looking for the Float Pin Retainer for a 30 PICT 2 Carb

Subject says it.  I'm rebuilding the original 30 PICT 2 carb from my '69 Westy (1600sp) to do some
comparisons between it and the Brosol H30/31 that's on there now.  Problem is, I can't find the
float pin retainer anywhere.  I opened up an old 34 PICT 3 I have laying around, and it's missing
that part as well.  I haven't seen this part for sale from any vendor that I've searched (at least
online).

Anyone have one (actually, two, need one for the 34 PICT 3 as well) or know where to get them?

The float pin retainer is item #34 in below picture:
