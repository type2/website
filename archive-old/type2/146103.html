Subject: So I bought this hat...

We got a good laugh out of this anyhow... A few weeks ago we finally went to Florida. Panama City to be exact. We live in a small town in TN that does not have a VW dealership and our TN big city visits are always on the weekends with the dealer parts counters are closed so I took this vacation time as a chance to go to a VW dealer parts counter and inquire about some of the tiny things that disappear from a car when the PO just doesn't care. Plastic things, rubber things, and such. We took our '97 VW Cabrio for the trip and it was fun! GOT to get that cruise control repaired (bad relay in the module). 

He didn't have any of the parts I wanted, I forgot to ask for a few others, but I got some answers from his mechanic for questions that have been on my mind so I bought a VW hat from him... 

A few days later my wife mentions that Volkswagen is mispelled on the side!!! Volkswagon it says... Can't even trust the dealer to sell &quot;good&quot; stuff! &lt;griN!&gt;
