&gt; I was just wondering if anyone out there is getting paid to drive their bus?
&gt; A buddy of mine was telling me about it. I was just surfing the web on the
&gt; various companies that either give you a car or pay you to drive your car with a
&gt; 3M type sticker ad on it.  I know it sounds funny.  Just wondering if anyone
&gt; has done it.  Is it as good as it sounds?

I looked into it but the fine print turned me off.
