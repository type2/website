Hi Edward,

I've heard your job will be a lot easier if you get a
letter from VW confirming it meets all applicable US
requirements.  I've also heard VW only sends these
letters to the original owner.  Assuming no other
problems, how much will you save?

Where do you find a good listing of what used vehicles
are available in Canada?  I've noticed the Canadians
like diesels, but I think because Canadian VW diesels
run dirtier, they may be uniquely hard to import.

Rob
