&gt; water filler for the sink and must of tightened it too much as they broke
&gt; the tube that goes down into the cabinet.
&gt; Do I need to get the whole cabinet or does someone know much about getting
&gt; the tank out or is there a quick fix.  

I take the sink cabinet out of my 72 all the time so that I can haul stuff.
1. Undo the two 10mm nuts behind the passenger seat.
2. Pull up the carpet or whatever along the walkway side of the cabinet.
You are looking for two screws that go through a bracket into the floor
of the bus.  Take them out.
3. Pop the top and unscrew the sink vent cover on the outside of the bus.
This makes it a lot easier to remove the sink vent.  Remove sink vent.
4. Lay under the bus where the drain for the sink comes through the floor
of the bus. Take off the metal plate and other stuff that goes around
this area.  My bus is missing some of these parts so I'm not really 
sure what exactly is suppossed to be here.
5. With a little help you can tilt the cabinet toward the rear of the bus,
then carefully lift the cabinet out.  Be super careful not to let the sink
drain or the tank drain get caught on the body as you pull it out, it might 
break if you force it hard enough.  From here it is easy to remove the tank.

However, you may not have to do all this.  The filler tube for the tank is 
just pressed into the top of the tank.  If you can get a good grip on the
filler tube, you may be able to work it out of the top of the tank without
 pulling the cabinet out.  I don't know where you will get a new one though.
