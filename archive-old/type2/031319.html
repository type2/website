&gt; There seems to be a lot of people on this list that have bad rusted out

&gt; reasonable cost. Any Idea how much a stripped beam weighs? What would coast

less than an engine

&gt; them and sending them off, but I know cost is an important factor in the

cost me about $100 to ship a type IV engine from MD to CA.  trucking
company, on a pallet.
