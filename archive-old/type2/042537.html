Subject: Bosch service manuals

Hello Volks,
In my neverending quest to fully understand the Bosch L-jetronic system
used in my 76 westy (and drive everyone else nuts in the proccess) I
have come upon two manuals that look like they might have some juicy
information on the FI system.  These two books are:

1. L-Jetronic Fuel-Injection System by Bosch GmbH
- Working principle, fuel system, control system, control unit,
 electrical circuitry, lambda closed-loop control

    -or-

2. Bosch Fuel Injection and Engine Management by Probst, Charles O.
- How to Understand, Service and Modify


Have any of you read either of these books, and if you have, do you have
any recommendations on which one more difinitively explains the
L-Jetronic system?  I mean, I'm looking for all the nitty gritty, PhD
requiring, do-it-yerself, hard-core AFM/ECU wiring diagraming, factory
tuning instructions, make me wanna go dizzy info so I can really tweak
the system... back to stock condition of course :)

Any input put would be HIGHLY appreciated!

Thanks,
Mike
'76 westy soon to be named... shelby?
p.s. If any of you are interested in these books, I found 'em on the
bentley site...
