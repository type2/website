&gt; Geez, sorry - I sent the first version in enriched text.  I'll try again.
&gt; 
&gt; Here's one:  while my engine's out and on the dolly, and I'm removing parts
&gt; (latest: heat exchangers) to replace or pretty up, what do you all recommend
&gt; to cover the holes (carb and exhaust ports, so far) while it waits for
&gt; another day?  Right now I've got a clean rag and a peanut butter jar cap
&gt; over the carb and the exhaust ports are stuffed with the plastic from a dry
&gt; cleaner bag.  I figure cloth might attract moisture into the exhaust ports.
&gt; At various times the garage swirls with sawdust, sandblasting sand, kerosene
&gt; and compressed air.  No fair telling me to hurry up and finish the engine
&gt; work, I would if I could.  Thanks.
