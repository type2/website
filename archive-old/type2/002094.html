  Hi Listees. Well winter is sure here in Southern Ontario. I've put the bus
(The Contraption) in the garage for some body work and have pulled the
engine for access to the engine bay. A couple questions:

I inspected the clutch as per Bently and decided to replace the disk as the
linnings have worn below the 1/16&quot; min.
The through out bearing spins smoothly with no noise. Any reason to replace
it other than age? The rear trans shaft seal and engine front seal are both
servicable.

Also has anyone come across the rubber elbows on the corners of the intake
manifold balance tube? Specifically the R/H on as it has an additional
nipple for vacuum. I think Bus Depot has the standard one.

I replaced both heads 2 years ago and I think I might strip of the shrouding
for a retorque. Is there usually some nuts undertorque spec. after 5
thousand miles?

Lastly. Last year I replace the transaxel fluid with synthetic GL4/GL5
fluid. I'd like to get straight GL4 even non synth.
as I don't want any excess wear of the tranny. I can only special order it
in 20 litre pails for 90.00$ Can.
Any other sources in Canada?

See ya
