&gt; HELP!!!!
&gt; Ok I have a type4 2.ol and  im replacing the clutch and found that the pilot
&gt; bearing is well gone, pretty well toasted . I was wondering if I need to
&gt; remove the fly wheel to put a new one in? any help on this would be great.

No, just get a pilot bearing puller.  It has little hooks that fit behind
the pilot bearing and a slide hammer that lets you tap it out.  When you
put the new one in, just tap it flush with the outer surface, not all the
way in.  The next replacer will thank you.
