Subject: New '82 westy

this is my first post to this list

I was hoping to buy a westy this summer, and I found one here in reno for
$700! the interior is very clean, the outside has some dings and chips. I am
very happy. No manuals though.so I don't know anything about this.

My question is (I am waiting for my Bentley book to arrive). What encine
does this have? It has been 25 years since my last air-cooled, and I have
never owned a bus is there anything i need to be extra aware of?

this is the bus if anyone wants to look:
