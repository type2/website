        Yup -- that's life in VW land. I can recall when my wife rolled
our '69 van one Winter day because the engine, which was running great
until that very moment, seized up, locking up the rear end on a icy
road. I swore at that point I'd never, ever own another VW again. And
didn't, for quite awhile. About 18 years in fact, except for a brief
affair with a VW Diesel Rabbit.
        Fact is, Blake, VW's are just a royal pain in the ass -- you
gotta be a masochist to own one. Or any antique car, for that matter,
especially if you think of it as a &quot;daily driver&quot;. Right now I've got my
'73 westy, my new toy  -- a '73 Opel GT, and my '61 Mack semi-tractor --
all torn apart. And I hate turning wrenches -- it's a sickness, believe
me, a sickness. Might even be a form of demonic possession for all I
know. Even worse, i'm looking at a '48 Chev 2-ton truck with just an
enormous amount of acquisition lust.
