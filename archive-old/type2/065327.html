If you use the main battery to drive the relay, it will always work unless
your main battery gets drained, and that's what the relay is there to
prevent.
If you want to be able to connect the batteries no matter which one is
dead, just add another wire and a small switch which routes aux. battery
power to the connection which &quot;triggers&quot; the relay.

Or, you could simply jumper the terminals at the relay to connect the
batteries and jump start the engine.  Or you could just carry jumper
cables, which is a good idea anyway.  Not a big problem in my book.  Jump
starting the main battery is not the relay's main function anyway.  It's
there to keep appliances from running the main battery down and still let
the aux battery charge while driving.  It does this very well.
