Subject: Re: [T2] broke down (nuts!)

Hey I've put time on my Corvair implant by borrowing the lawnmower's gas tank and gravity feeding those carbs. 

As for push starting - I have actually push started my Beetles and even our bus by myself. Takes a flat piece of pavement and a good starting engine... Started my Beetle with a rachet wrench a couple times - socket on the alternator... 

FWIW I suggest you put a quart of fuel on the roof with a fuel line to the carb(s). Keeps the fire out of the bus. Fire extinguisher at the ready...
