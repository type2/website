Subject: [T2] RE: storing spare keys

A suggestion I've made to quite a few of my customers asking about storing a
spare is to drill the keyhole out to 1/4 inch, then put it behind the
license plate.  Screw through the key; it's harsly noticable and a dime will
remove the screw (unless you put a philips screw in).  Be sure that if you
do this you use a brass key.  Steel keys will rust in short order and
aluminum keys will corrode badly.  Just a suggestion.
