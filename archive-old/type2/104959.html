&gt; &gt;I don't know about removing them -- I was looking into that myself and it
&gt; &gt;seems tricky at least. Mine are copper -- I don't understand how they
&gt; &gt;could rust.
&gt; 
&gt; I'll have to take a picture. The condensation tubes in the breather lines are
 perhaps made of someting besides copper?

 I haven't gotten up that far yet. Frankly I'm having a hard time reaching
 up that far, but I'm going to try, as I had some gas spillage onto 
 the left battery tray when filling the tank really full. I want to stop
 that before really bad things happen.
 
&gt; Up in the intake area there are a lot of metal folds and such and rust likes 
to collect in there. Would it be a good idea to cut the vents out, prep the are
a and weld them back in?
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;VW also put  a lot of caulk around the engine compartment
&gt; 
&gt; I noticed that and left all of it alone the last time I went in there with a 
paintbrush. What is it exactly and where can I locate more? I understand why it
's there, I just can't identify it.

I don't know what they used but there's a body caulk product that I saw the
other day that should do the trick. It remains flexible and can be primered/
painted over. I didn't get any yet. Like I said, I want to get down to bare
metal, then POR-15, then I'll recaulk, shoot on some POR-15 Tie-Coat, then
my enamel on top. Next time I'm at that store I'll grab the name of the 
product. It's pricey -- IIRC it's $13 for a small tube, but one tube should
do the whole engine compartment. In my bus the majority of the caulk is
around the battery trays and those &quot;triangular&quot; areas just inside (center
of bus) the battery trays and just behind the firewall.

My main frustration with this job is that I can't get the wiring harnass
out because of the diagnostic port. I could probably unhook it from
the front of the bus and pull it back though, but that's an awful lot of
work. I'll probably end up just wrapping it up really well in plastic
and taping it off, and cursing because it keeps getting in the way while
I'm painting. I'll be covering up most of my new paint job with NASA
insulation a la Bulley-Hewlett, so it's not essential that it be perfect
in appearance.
