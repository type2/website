If the Sermons were published, and perhaps revised, annotated, etc. by the
author, how many of you would buy a copy?  How much would you be willing to
pay for such a concentrated package of down to earth, clearly written VW
wisdom?    Surely it is worth at least as much as St. Muir's often
questionable lore? Net access costs me $20cdn/month, I would be willing to
pay substantially more than that for such a reference work.

Let's try to find an agreeable solution to this.

I feel the same way.  What a terrible loss for all of us air cooled VW people.
I would certainly buy a copy (I notice that Gene Berg offers prints of his
advise/wisdom about VW's for about $30).  I always felt that 'The Sermons'
would always be there for reference when I needed them and feel a terrible sense
of loss now that they are gone.
