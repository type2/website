Is the abuse you speak of that which you heap upon her in your post?  Show
her your missive and, if she's smart, she'll leave you and the bus solving
both of your problems.  Seriously, try a line of tape on the tach and tell
her what it means and why it matters, or a rev limiter on the ignition.
on her behalf, OUCH
on behalf of your bus, good luck.
