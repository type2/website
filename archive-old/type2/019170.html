As they used to say on the Starkist commercials, &quot;Sorry Charley!&quot;

VW type2 is 5 on 112 mm or, if I've done my calc's correctly, 5 on
4.410.  This subject has been beaten to death on the Vanagon list.  The
ONLY other stock wheels that have the correct hole pattern are Audi 5000
turbo wheels and Mercedes wheels.  The Audi wheels, while commonly
available, have an incorrect backspacing.  VW is, I believe, 35 mm and
the Audi is 45 mm.  To use the Audi wheels on a type2, you have to open
up the center and use a 10 mm spacer with the necessary longer studs.
Even with the spacer, the incorrect offset is going to be rough on the
wheel bearings.  The Merc wheels are the best answer, but they tend to
be a bit pricey.  Ford, Chevy, Jeep, Chryco etc, just plain don't fit.

There has been a thread on Vanagon lately about custom building wide 15&quot;
wheels.  The price has been quoted at around $25 per.  If the thread
turns serious, I'll forward the details.
