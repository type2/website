Try shifting several thousand times a minute.
Or, remove the black wire from the points side
of the coil and put it back where you found it :)

Subject: [T2] Back up switch/engine stall


&gt; I recently installed a new back up light switch in my 69 bus (same part#
that
&gt; came off), hooked it up, put it in reverse and the engine stalls. Take it
&gt; immediately out of reverse and the engine kicks back on. Thought maybe
this
&gt; could be that I had the wires on backwards because they are both black, so
I
&gt; switched them and no change. Unhook the switch all together and there is
no
&gt; problem. Weird huh! The only thing I have recently done to the bus is put
a new
&gt; starter,CV's, cleaned the ground strap for the tranny, and the B/U switch.
I've
&gt; looked at the wiring and it looks clean and hooked up correctly. Any ideas
on
&gt; where to start?
