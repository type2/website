&gt; I thought you guys were talking about D-8 Cat heater boxes---
&gt;
&gt; Good one George---   ~: )
&gt;
&gt; What about stainless heat exchanger's?
&gt;
&gt; Now I'm really thinking----
&gt;
&gt; Thin wall, light weight, no corrosion, no rust, no failure.

Good idea, but more than a notion to engineer.  True stainless is rather
brittle and considering the dissimlar metals, heat, and vibration this
would be a pretty tough task with thin material.

Not to say that it can't be done, but I'd hate to put a lot
of effort into it and then find that my nice rust-free heat exchangers are
developing lots of cracks.

Remember those &quot;stainless&quot; mufflers that turned out to be welded with mild
steel rod and have mild steel internals?  They sure looked pretty while
they rusted out inside!
