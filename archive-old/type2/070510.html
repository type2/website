Subject: No help in Sacramento?

 
I posted something along these lines earlier this week, but so far 
no help has appeared....: 
 
Emmett Goldsbourough, president of the local NEATO chapter 
but not on line, is having problems finding someone to help him  
either check out a bus, or help him find someone to check it out. 
He is in Maryland, the bus is in Sacramento, CA. 
 
If you have any ideas on this, please call Emmett at (410) 756-6134. Thanks

 
Tom F.
