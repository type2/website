I have only seen one pic of a synchro breadloaf driving up a steep incline (snow in 
the pic?). Only made it to the experimental stage and were then killed. :(

&gt; Syncro Breadloafs are probably rarest of the rare.
&gt; I believe five were built, and I have a nice action
&gt; photo of one -courtesy of Ric Golen- 
&gt; that I'll be posting to my Syncro Westie
&gt; page when I get a chance...
