U = FM
L = long wave AM
M = medium wave AM

Very few stations broadcast on long wave these days.  It carries a long way
(like hundreds of miles) but is prone to a lot of interference.  The
frequency is of the order of 200kHz (1500m wavelength).

&gt; -----Original Message-----
&gt; anything at all and the bands are labeled U, L and M. I have 
&gt; the schematic
&gt; in the manuals I got with my camper.
&gt; 
&gt; Can anyone tell me what this third band is for?
