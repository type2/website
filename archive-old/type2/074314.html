Subject: Charcoal Filter??

what is the point of the charcoal filter anyways?  Why not send the
fumes directly into the intake?

&gt; Hiya Jason,
&gt; 
&gt; Your description of the function of the emissions (E-Can:  Emissions
&gt; Canister) system is basically correct.  However there is one very important
&gt; factor you overlooked.  This is NOT a passive system for trapping hydrocarbon
&gt; vapors.  Rather, the system actively draws off vapors from the tank via the
&gt; suction created by the cooling fan.  This is the reason for those hoses.
&gt; Whenever I am asked why the car smells like raw gas I look at the E-Can
&gt; system first.  In 99% of the cases it has been either removed or disabled.
&gt; If you remove the E-Can and its hoses you are asking for long term problems.
&gt; 
&gt; Consider that the evaporation point (temperature) for gasoline is very low.
&gt; This accounts for the presence of hydrocarbon vapors in relatively low
&gt; ambient temperatures.  But just wait for a warm day!  The vapors given off by
&gt; your tank can rise to dangerously high levels.  Dangerous both in terms of
&gt; health (hydrocarbons are a known carcinogen) and fire risk.  Now if you rig
&gt; up some other way of eliminating these fumes from the passenger cabin (they
&gt; will get there) or the engine compartment without the use of the E-Can you
&gt; will be dumping a raw pollutant into the outside atmosphere.
&gt; 
&gt; Are you sure you want to go this route simply for the sake of eliminating a
&gt; couple of hoses?  And, for what it's worth, that E-Can should be replaced
&gt; every 40,000 miles.  Replacements are still available via your local VW
&gt; dealer.
