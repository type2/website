&gt;&gt;What ever happened to sounding the horn on those twisty roads?  That's
&gt;&gt;always worked for me.

&gt;How many of our busses have working horns ;-).

&gt;column)

Mine doesn't.  Well, sometimes, but not usually.  Not enough to say I would
ever depend on it in an off-road situation.  It's actually a good thing,
though.  Before I would always have an impulse to honk at people, and now
that mine hasn't worked for a while, even when I'm in other cars I hardly
ever honk at people.  I think I honked too much.
