Subject: Upright oil leak
Message-Id: &lt;v04011701b3786f21a055_at_[207.55.127.46]&gt;

Just pulled  the engine from my 68 last night. The SP has 34K miles on a
complete rebuild The main reason was a worsening oil leak.  I thought it
would be from the usual suspect,  Mr. oil cooler.  After an initial
inspection I'm not so sure.  The cooler to case  seals *look* like they
were holding OK.  The cooler itself is mostly dry, except for the bottom
1/2&quot; or so.  I could push the cooler up and down a bit.  The top of the
case is very slimy all over, with the worse mess in the front where the tin
joins in front of #1.  There *isn't* a flood around  #'s 3 &amp; 4, which I
would have expected had the cooler seals failed.
The main drip was showing at the bottom of the bellhousing when the engine
was in the car.  Bellhousing and clutch are all pretty slimy.  Pulled pp
and clutch, but not flywheel yet.  I figure the crank seal is suspect.

 Would it account for the mess on top of the case?
 What other things could be leaking up thar?
Is there a way to test the oil cooler _at_ home?  I do have regulated
compressed air available.
Anyone in Seattle want to stop by and look?  I'm a bit mystified about
this.....
