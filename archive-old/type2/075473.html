I recently pulled one from 70 westy in a junk yard. I was obvious that this
vehicle had been covered most of its life. NOT A CRACK IN IT!!
 
I did pay about 35 buck for it though :)
 
Oh yeah and I got a near perfect, rust-free gas tank too. No rust at all
just one tiny dent.
 
&gt;I'd say that uncracked plastic dashes of that vintage make hens' teeth
&gt;look plentiful!
