&gt; Hi Folks,
&gt; 
&gt; The article says the new bus will have &quot;high functionality with the comfort
&gt; of a limousine&quot;.
&gt; Now don't get me wrong, I like creature comforts as much as the next guy but
&gt; the reason we like our '71 is the simplicity and practicality.  This new bus
&gt; sounds more like a luxury car with a price to match.

compare new beetle with original,  get the idea?
