Subject: TWO SENSORS ON TRANNY

Hey guys,

	I wasn't able to find anyone that knew what the second sensor on my
transmission was. The two sensors I am talking about are the ones located at
the very front of the transmission. This would be, at the forward most part
of the transmission when looking at the tranny from under the bus. (closest
to the front of the bus on the transmission). 
With the responses I received, I learned that the one closest to the
passenger side was the reverse light switch. That happens to be the only one
that's connected right now. The OTHER sensor doesn't seem to have any wires
connected to it. It's a two pronged sensor. Could this be for the tachometer
or something?


Help! Thanks,
