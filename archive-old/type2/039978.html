Hi All.... speaking of gears and things.....
I've been having a prob with my kombi.. It's intermittant though, so that's
the puzzling thing...
(Three times this has happened... )
I choose to start my story here: (Aussies will understand that one)
I'll be driving normally, happily operating my 'feels like driving porridge
but at least I know how to drive it' gearbox and for some reason it decides
it no longer wants to go into 1st, 2nd or tonight, reverse too.
Trying to get it into gear gives the standard loud 'squeal and crunch.' ugh.
Here's the thing though, it goes into gear fine with the engine 'off'.. So
I'm forced to either crunch em (ewwww) or turn off the car to get it into
gear... :-/
The first time this happened I thought I'd have a look at the clutch (in my
own inimitable style). I swore at it and voila, back to porridge, but
finding the gears no problemo. Next time it only did it for a day, until
today, then it's back to find em and grind em...
I'm having the main seal and valves done next week, and they'll be dropping
the engine for that anyway, so do you think it's a clutch (plate?) thing or
a gearbox thing...or.... hmm... Seems strange that it fixed itself then
happened again after a week.. tsk.. Whatta PITA..
Anyhoo, any ideas would be much appreciated. It'll give me a chance to go to
the mechanic with a vague idea of which direction I want him to head.
Interested parties may like to know that the carby install went great, the
purple fur is being put in next week, as is the purple sequined ceiling.
(which will go perfectly with my glitter dash....) Body paint is being done
after this lot of work... Stand by for the mug shots. &lt;g&gt;

Thanks heaps for your advice all..
Cassandra
