&gt;
&gt;Yup! It's grounded thru it's case to the chassis when it's mounted on
&gt;the fan housing.

The coil case is grounded to the fan housing, but it's not part of the
ignition circuit.  Mostly it's to keep a voltage from being induced on
the metal case by the field inside the coil.  If you don't believe it,
and you have a running VW to start with, try this: undo the clamp bolt
on your coil, slide a piece of paper or thin cardboard in between the
clamp and the coil all the way around to insulate the case from ground,
tighten the clamp bolt again, and go start the engine.  It should fire
right up.  (Take the paper out when you're done experimenting.)

Look in the &quot;How Works a Volkswagen&quot; chapter in the Idiot manual or on
page E-5 11 of the '50-'62 Bentley.  In the Bentley, in particular, it
mentions how a good coil show show continuity from one small terminal
(1 or -) to the other (15 or +) and from the center terminal (4, high
voltage) to one of the small terminals (15 or +).  If there is continuity
between 1/- and the case, or 15/+ and the case, the coil is broken.

The schematic of a coil is something like this:

15 o---*-----short winding-----o 1
       |   === iron core ===
       `---big long winding----O 4

Take a look at one of the post-'73 wiring diagrams (current track
style) on vintagebus_dot_com for verification.

So John is still wondering how to tell what's wrong.  Probably at this
point the best action is to change the points and condenser, set the
points with a tach-dwell meter, and time it.  If you want to make another
test before tearing into the points, you can do a coil spark test without
the points and condenser.  Disconnect the primary (skinny) wire from the
distributor to the coil at the coil, and get another piece of wire long
enough to reach a good ground.  Hook this new wire to the place on the
coil that you just unplugged the distributor wire from, and strip the
other end of the wire for a half inch or so.  Find some _insulated_ pliers
to hold this wire with.  Don't skip the insulated pliers unless 300 volts
is your idea of a good time.

Go up front and turn on the key.  Use the insulated pliers, on the
insulation of your new wire, to hold that new wire away from ground.
Pull the secondary (fat) coil wire off of the distributor and hold it
close to a good ground (not the fuel system) just like a normal spark
test.  Now, bounce your new wire off of ground (not the fuel system) -
touch it to ground, take it away, touch it, take it away, etc.  You
are the points.  If the coil is generating sparks at the end of the
fat wire, then the supply of juice to the coil and the coil itself
are OK and your suspects are the primary wire from the coil to the
distributor or the points and condenser.  If you can't get the coil to
make sparks doing this, then either the coil is broken or it's not
getting juice from the ignition key.
