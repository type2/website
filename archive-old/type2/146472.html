&gt;Did you remember to reconnect the AFM to the wriing harness?


richard,

which is the AFM?  but im pretty sure i only undid 2 wireing
harnesses.  1 on the ecu (the thing near the battery) and the other
on the air filter box.

both hooked back up..

i also changed the small seals on the fuel injectors when i put them
back in ..

David.
