Subject: Lil' table that mounts on dash

If you are going to pull over on the side of the road and don't mind jumping 
in the back you could mount the table to the larger cabinet door (if you 
have a late Westy) like I did:
http://www.baywindowbus_dot_com/dashtable01.jpg

Since that picture I was able to secure another of the leg brackets (on the 
underside of the table) to keep the leg vertical and to keep the table from 
moving around on you...it is kind of wobbly in the front or rear.

As for the brackets the best thing to do is to hold the table to the dash 
and line it up...I think you would do better that way than to take 
measurements..if you measured and drilled and made a mistake you might end 
up with 4 needless holes or worse. It pretty much goes directly between the 
2 front seats. If you still need better info I can run out and measure it 
after 2 tommorrow.

Good luck,

Rob Henley
