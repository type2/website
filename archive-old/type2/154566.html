Subject: RE: Excuse my umbridge

But that is the exact problem - responses to these challenges are being
defined as the &quot;China&quot; problem. However, per capita consumption of energy is
almost 7 times higher in the United States (Canadians more than 7 times)
than it is in China; and still more two times higher than Europe.

It would be catastrophic to see each Chinese consume as much as every
American, but does that give you the right not to change your own
consumption patterns just because they are so many of them? Europeans live
conmfortably, too, but consume much less. The goal must be to stabilize
consumption at a sustainable level, and that means both: less consumption in
the developed world and setting development on a different energy trajectory
in developing countries. The Kyoto protocol calls this &quot;common but
differentiated&quot; responsibilities. The goal must be sufficiency not
abundance.

Back to the original post (and car content): emissions testing is about
Clean Air Act attainment - and that is about a number of exhaust gases but
not CO2. The climatic side effect are properly tuned engines which consume
less energy. Plus, a properly tuned bus runs better and is cheaper (less
gas).

BTW, maintaining an old car (and thus preventing the production of a new
one) is a great way of saving energy. Just think about the energy that would
have gone into recycling and producing the replacement.

Sorry, but yet another bus-driving academic who could not tolerate
half-truths and convenience arguments ...
