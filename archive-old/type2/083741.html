Subject: engine mounts

Hello all-

Just curious for some input on whether or not I need to fabricate some engine mounts for my 72 westy into which I have recently installed a type 1 motor.  I know that in the bugs I have owned in the past, there were no mounts.  It is one of those things that I know couldn't hurt, but is it necessary?

thanks

Kurt Rogers                                                                                                                                                                    Madison, Wisconsin
