Subject: Re: [T2] CV joints on VW Bus: changing the allen key
  nuts????????????????????????

&gt; You need a grade 10.9 bolt

list,

for what it is worth, i just put new cv boots on my VW thing and the kit
came with grade 12.9 bolts. not sure if this is standard as i was surprised
they were that hard. the only other grade 12.9 fasteners on a bus are the
head studs. the boot kits were german made by &quot;te-gu-fa&quot;.

most boot kits come with the proper fasteners.

is it possible that leon is trying to use a hex key wrench on the XZN (or
triple square) screws? with the right tool these screws are not difficult to
remove and install. with the wrong tool they could be a real pain.
