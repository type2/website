Subject: Key Blanks

I might be able to get VW key blanks in bulk from a local locksmith.
They'll need a little time to make sure that the blanks are available to
them (I get the &quot;R&quot; blank there for my bus).

What I'll need to know is which blanks are the most difficult to find.  I
used the page that Richard sent yesterday to see what key blanks are used,
but I don't know which are the most needed.

The blanks come in a box of either 50 or 100 (not sure yet), and I don't
want to put out a ton of cash for blanks that I'll end up stuck with.

Suggestions?
