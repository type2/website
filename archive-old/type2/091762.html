Subject: Re: [T2] blown 1700 w/dual carbs - value?

Depends on how bad.  Was it spun out at high speed?  Only way to tell 
for sure is crack the case.
an engine that was run to that point will usually have at  least one 
head with cracks and  replace all valves.
If your getting all of the top stuff, that is always useful as trading 
material or spares or filling storage shelves.

&gt; My friend said that he thought is was bearings.  Would the case still be
&gt; useable?  I guess I could always just take the good stuff off and make 
&gt; one
&gt; good engine out of two.
