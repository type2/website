Subject: 12 Volt electric blanket.

Because of the upcoming holiday season, my home has been flooded
with various catalogs. One I go today advertises a 12 volt electric
blanket. It is 62&quot; X 50&quot; and draws 15 amps. # 331661-F507 is the
item #. The catalog is Great Northern. I have never ordered from them
but they like sending me catalogs. :)
