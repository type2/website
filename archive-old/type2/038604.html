Subject: oil light

Hi All,

I'm a recent owner of a '71 Westy and I've been going through the interior
cleaning things up. Consequently, I haven't driven it a lot. In the last
couple times out, I've noticed the oil light comes on
at idle, after coming up to temperature. Right now, I'm running 40 wt. oil
and I'm thinking of going to 20/50. I rev her a little and it goes out. Yes,
the oil level is correct.
However, with little history of the bus I can't discount something might be
wrong, like the oil pump going south.
Should I worry about this or switch oil weights and see what happens?

Thanks,

Pete
