Subject: '78 sliding door and Nice Bus page

1.  When I inherited Hildegarde, the sliding door was stuck shut.  Me, my
dad, and a friend (a very VW friend) took the door off, greased up the
whole thing, all the grooves on the body for it, and put it back on.  It
was great!  Then I got the car painted and they moved the brackets on both
the door and the body where the little latch goes into the square hole in
the front.  I adjusted it back to where it was okay and it worked for a
while, but it seems now that any time I adjust it, it just gets bad again
right away.  Last winter I thought it was just the cold playing with the
slider in back, but I'm not buying that anymore.  I want a door that closes
with one hand, especially from the inside!  Any clues on how to keep it so
the latch goes into the hole without hitting the sides of the bracket or
other ways to solve this problem once and for all?

Also, I was looking around the other day and found that &quot;Nice Bus&quot; homepage
by some guy, Sean O'Brien, who has it up through Princeton.  Well, I was
gonna write him for a survey but the mail wouldn't go through so I searched
the Princeton directory for his name, but I guess he's not listed.  Maybe
he just dropped out, but I'd still like to get a hold of him to talk about
this book he's supposedly writing and see if its for real or what...
Anybody know him?
