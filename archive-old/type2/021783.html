Clark:
It doesn't look that bad to me.
I've got a little bit different perspective on this. Some might even accuse me of
being a pig-headed purist, but I believe my ideas stand up to logic. I'm an
amateur metal bumper and have a pretty good selection of hammers and dollies and a
porta-power. (A porta-power is a small hydraulic jack with interchangeable rams
and extensions made for body work.)
You can bet that if the vehicle in question were a 1952 Porsche, where the good
used or new parts were simply not available, the RIGHT way to fix it would be to
straighten what was there. There is also the question of making more damage to the
surrounding area by using non- factory methods of welding in repair parts. The
factory has a rather comprehensive procedure of rustproofing the chassis after it
is welded which probably includes DIPPING the whole thing in zinc chromate primer.
It is damn near impossible to get a chassis as well rustproofed in the field after
mig welding on it.
So, I believe the correct way to fix your car is push or pull the structure of the
door frame back into shape with either a frame machine (Buske, Kansas Jack, et
al.) or possibly push it with a porta- power. The porta- power is a tool you could
buy  or rent and use at home. It does not have the capacity of the bigger floor
machines. It would probably not do the job if the damage is into the floor of the
bus. If the damage is that bad, it's probably time to send it down to your local
uni-body specialist. You could still save a good deal of money on that phase of
the repair by taking all the surrounding parts off. Try to talk to the person
actually doing the work.
I've got a really good book, _...Metal Bumping_ by Sargent that was sold by
Eastwood Company at one time.

&gt; Thanks Terry,
&gt; The inner panel is damaged - headlight bucket is kicked in farther than it
&gt; should be - kick panel won't sit in its slots correctly...if you look at pic 6
&gt; in the series, you can see a the floor crinklage as well.
&gt; Hinge post is not damaged, but is out of position enough to kick the door out
&gt; of alignment engough to require a serious hard slam for it to close.
&gt;
&gt; I guess going into this thinking i'm not going to replace the whole left front
&gt; side of the bus is a bit of a pipe dream. isn't it?

&gt; Estimate?
&gt; Impossible without physiclly examinining the bus.
&gt; From the looks of it, and this is the way I would do it, I would be
&gt; looking for a front R/H door, and a front panel.
&gt; The front hinge post could be damaged, the inner panel could be damaged.
&gt;
&gt; Do it right---do it once.
