Subject: 78 skylight?

Yet another question about my 78. (sorry) 
I'm not sure if it had a skylight or top or what (yeah
I'm ignorant) but there is a 3'x3' patch on top of
mine. I understand some of them had a removable top or
something along those lines. Whoever owned this thing
last siliconed it up. Thanks
