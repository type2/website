Hi Eric and List,

&gt;75-80 on a flat highway with no wind.
&gt;90 on a flat highway with wind behind you
&gt;55 on a flat highway with wind against you
&gt;45-50 on a steep hill with no wind
&gt;60 on a gradual incline...like Denver to Leadville

Having driven from Denver to Aspen recently, I don't recall ANY gradual 
inclines between Denver and Leadville!!

Your Bus must be geared differently, since my '79 Westy can only make 75mph 
at 5,000rpm redline (though I'm using a VDO tach with a noisy ground).  It 
seems like my 2.0 FI has power for more, but it's wound tight with the .88 
4th gear I have.

I'd fill in your chart as such:
70-75 on a flat highway with no wind
75 on a flat highway with wind behind you
60-70 on a flat highway with wind against you
40-50 on a steep hill with no wind
65 on a gradual incline...like I-70 West of the Utah border

Your actual speeds may vary...
