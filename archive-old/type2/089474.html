Subject: Re: [T2] Paint and body questions:

Hi Terry,

     I used to agree with you 100 % when I first started to use a HVLP gun.
After talking to a DeVilbiss rep, I learned to play with different size
tips, air pressures, cheating on Enamel reduction, and speed (stroke) of
application. Now I love it! It has cut our paint cost way down. It just
wastes less paint, by getting it on the car, and not in the air or on the
ground.
     I find that it still will leave an Acrylic Enamel job a little rougher
than I like, but we color sand and buff everything we do anyway. Of course
we are after a glassy finish on everything any way.  It does work best on
Base - Clear though.
     I remember when Lacquer began to get real popular in the aftermarket.
Everyone Bitched and Whined, then a funny thing happened, the more people
got used to it, the better they liked it. Same thing will happen with the
HVLP.
