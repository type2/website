&gt; I read in a recent posting that Ron (I think) was selling a bus
&gt; driven accross
&gt; from the west coast by a ozzy.
&gt;
&gt; I am English and the idea of driving from west to east across the
&gt; US appeals
&gt; to me, is this sensible? Could I buy a bus on the West coast and
&gt; expect to be
&gt; able to sell it again on the East?


The answer is yes you could, but what might vary is how much you'd get for
the bus when you were ready to sell it here on the east coast, given that
you would have to sell it rather quickly.  What you'd have going for you is
that if you bought a rust-free, relatively clean Westy at a reasonable cost
out West (say, a '74 or newer, which has more value, or even better a
'76-up), it would be worth more on the east coast by virtue of its lack of
rust by east coast standards.  If you bought it for around $2000, you could
almost certainly recoup most if not all of your investment, barring any
unforseen repair costs en route.  You could always sell it to me if you
needed to sell it quickly, as the family from Australia did, but of course I
would pay you a bit less than a private party might, as I'd want to make a
few hundred on it when I resold it.  The family from Australia bought the
bus for about $2200 and sold it to me for about the same, but they had to
put a new head on it for about $1000 with labor when it broke down half way
across the country. Still they were very happy, as they got to drive a Westy
for about 2 months for basically the cost of that $1000 repair plus gas.
This is far less than a rental and hotels would have cost.  Had the head not
failed, they would have driven it for two months for no cost at all.

Evon and I are planning a trip to England and Germany in October, and will
be (hopefully) &quot;renting&quot; a Westy from a customer of mine near London for the
trip.  So we'll be doing basically the same thing as you are considering,
but in reverse.
