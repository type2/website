&gt;5,000 mile trip is not that big a deal if your bus is in good shape.

That's about as true a statement as any


&gt;I would do it tomorrow if I had the time and $$$ available.
&gt;Unfortunately I have a day job and a family with kids in school. And
&gt;of course 5,000 miles is only the race itself; Even if you lived
&gt;right on the route itself you still need to get to the start point
&gt;and home from the finish. So it's a 10,000 - 12,000 mile trip, really.

I just took a look with RandMcNally TripMaker, from home to Key West 
to Fairbanks to home is just under 11k miles, about 200 hr of driving time.
I'd probably need 3 weeks for the trip &amp; the time just isn't there.

It would be good fun wouldn't it?
