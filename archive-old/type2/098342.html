Subject: Engine cleansing

List,

During my careless first sandblasting experience, I didn't cover the engine, which was sitting nearby. The time has come to put it back together and there is sand in every crevice, cylinder, rod, and orifice. Should I use a solvent? If I leave miss something, would it seriously screw up the engine? Anyone with any experience? Right now, the cylinder heads are off and the cylinders have been slightly moved. It is my first experience at reassembling an engine. Any info is appreciated. 

                                                                           Thanks,

                                                                           Paul Deatherage
