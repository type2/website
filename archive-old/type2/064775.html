Subject: Re:More support for fuel line pressure 

Jesse L Reynolds Writes:
&gt;So if this is the problem, how can I confirm it?  And what might be 
&gt;causing it?  Someone mentioned contacts in the air flow sensor.  How can 
&gt;I test that?  What about the fuel pump or pressure regulator?  Just some 
&gt;ideas.....

Jesse: With my limited knowledge, I've vote for the check valve in the fuel
pump. Try removing the cold start valve, and opening it with 12v. Try
right after van was started. It should spray for a short time due to 
pressure in the lines. Repeat after standing for a while. If the pressure is 
gone, then it won't squirt. Also note, your fuel pressure regulator could 
have a small leak, or dirt in it so it bleeds off the pressure slowly when 
the van isn't running.

About the Air Flow Contacts. The van should start without them because
when cranking, the fuel pump is enabled. If they are dirty, the van won't
continue to run after starting (I learned this Saturday morning). I forget
which pins they are, but they will be open circuit if van is stopped, and
should be closed during cranking or running. Use an ohmeter, or test lamp
with the cable disconnected. 
Because the cover is burned off my AFS, I can see this stuff ;-(. 
I was quite suprised that even when cranking, the AFS is open a fair amount. 
It is also suprising to see as the engine stops. during the last few turns, 
the AFS is gyrating wildly, and you can actually see it open and close as 
the last cylinder or two suck, and then stop as its valves open, and close.
