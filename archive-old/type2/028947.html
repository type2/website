Subject: [T2] Fan housing Air Non-Return Flap and Pin


Does anyone know whee I can get a set of &quot;Air Non-Return Flaps and Pins&quot; for
a '76 type IV.  This is what the Bentley manual ('68-'79) calls them on page
5-21 in Fig 7-3 Item 24.  They are the little metal flaps which keep the
Heater blower air from blowing back into the fan housing at low RPM's.  Mine
are gone and I can't find any at local wrecking yards (or they want me to
buy the entire fan housing).
