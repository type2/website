Subject: Sound Insulation ! Found it !

After a little help I found it. Noisekiller is the product in question.

Now that I found it and remember the name, has anyone used Noisekiller and
what do you think. I'm interested in opinions concerning price, application
and whether it met expectations.

Thanks,
Bill
