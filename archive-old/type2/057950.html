In case anyone, here are the last-minute Internet air fare specials to St.
Louis.  They E-mail these out only a few days before the weekend, the deals
are pretty good.

You can always purchase a bus and throw away your return ticket &lt;grin&gt;.

Not able to make it myself, being in Seattle... but I am sure there are some
out there willing to pick up a listee at the Airport.
