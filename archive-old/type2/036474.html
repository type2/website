Subject: Re: Pulling a steering wheel

David,


Hee-hee! Isn't that a fun chore??? Not!

In answer to your question; no, it's not supposed to
come off easily (I wish) and unless you are lucky
enough to have the VW shop-tool to pull it, I wouldn't
waste time/money trying to find a puller that will
work (I've never seen one that will). I suppose you
could fab one, but it'd be some work.

The only way I've been able to get mine off was to
*loosen* the nut, sit in the driver's seat, and pull
upward on the wheel with all your might while a friend
smacks the holy-hell out of the steering rod (hit it
on the end only) with a 5lb sledge-hammer!

Remember...don't pull the nut off all of the way, or
you may lose a few teeth when the steering wheel
finally comes flying off into your face;-) Also,
pulling the nut *after* will clean up any threads that
were bunged-up by the hammer. Also, make sure to stuff
the horn wire down into the steering shaft, or it'll
get smooshed. 

I was shown this method by a bonafied VW mechanic who
didn't have, nor had he ever seen, the official VW
wheel-removal tool! It's scary-as-hell the first time
(at least if you want to keep the steering wheel),
'cause that wheel will *FLEX* like a mother before it
finally pops off!!!

Have fun ;-)

&gt; In pulling the steering wheel off of a 72 bus,
&gt; shouldnt it just pull

&gt; get mine to budge. Im 
&gt; almost thinking about getting some kind of gear
&gt; puller since I am replacing 
&gt; the wheel anyways. I tried hitting upwards on the
&gt; bottom of the wheel and 
&gt; even taping on the center shaft while pulling
&gt; upwards. I cant get it to move 
&gt; at all. Any suggestions on how to get the dang thing
&gt; off ?
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks,
