Oh, gawd, that is funny...  Here's a groaner for all of you...

A mechanic who worked out of his home had a dog named Mace.
Mace had a bad habit of eating all the grass in the mechanic's lawn, so
the mechanic had to keep Mace inside. The grass eventually became
overgrown.

One day the mechanic was working on a car in his back yard and dropped
his wrench losing it in the tall grass. He searched and searched but,
because 
of the tall grass, couldn't find it for the life of him.    Eventually
he 
decided to call it a day and buy a new wrench the next day.

That night Mace escaped from the house and ate all the grass in the back 
yard. The next morning the mechanic went outside and saw his wrench
glinting 
in the sunlight.

Realizing what had happened he looked up to the heavens &amp; proclaimed...
