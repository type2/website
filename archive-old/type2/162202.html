H volks,

My bus dropped out its oil drain plug on the highway travelling  
through Buffalo. Luckily I was glancing at the CHT gauge when it  
happened, and happened to notice the movement on the pressure gauge  
before it hit the red zone. I glided off to the side and watched as  
the remaining oil leaked out onto the shoulder of the road.

We looked back along the road for about 1/4 mile but couldn't find  
the plug. Jamie Auch lent me a seat-belt retaining bolt from his 71  
high-top along with a couple liters of 20W50 and we were back on our  
way in no time.

Happy Trails,

Greg Potts
