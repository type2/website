Subject: Fuel Filler Hose - Help!
Content-type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII

My '73 needs a new fuel filler hose (runs from where you put the gas into the
bus to the tank).  Unfortunately, nobody seems to carry it, not VW, not the
Old Volkshome, or RMMW, or Bus Depot.  Can anyone help me in finding a
suitable replacement or how they solved this problem?

Thanks,
