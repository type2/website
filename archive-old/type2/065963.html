Subject: Ball Joint Replacement

Has anyone any experience replacing ball joints on a loaf? Must the torsion arms
be removed fron the van as outlined in Bently, or can the joints be replaced
while they're on the van using a ball joint press tool? How likely is it that
I'll find that the bearing surfaces/bearings on the torsion arm will be worn? 

TIA, any help very much appreciated.
