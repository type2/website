Dear Folks,

I had this done to my Alt*ma at the dealership which usually does my service
work. I don't know if this happens all the time, but my head gasket got
blown in the process. I felt really sorry for the guys who had to clean up
after that. Needless to say the dealership replaced the head gasket at no
charge, but it made me a little gun shy of having this done again.

Chris and Gus the &quot;Boy, sure am glad that didn't happen to me!&quot; Bus in
Atlanta
