&gt; I started a hunt for a way to quieten it down. VW's are pretty noisy 
&gt; sometimes of course.
&gt; 
&gt; The search naturally led to Dynamat but the cost was way to high for my 
&gt; budget to support enough material to do this bus which has lots of floor.
&gt; 
&gt; Finally I started talking to local roofers - specifically ones that worked 
&gt; on commercial flat roofs. One very helpful fellow here in middle TN took 
&gt; the time to show me the materials he uses which were mostly as you can 
&gt; imagine, the standard thin tar papers.
&gt; 
&gt; However he showed me a roll of modified polymer+bitchum - that is 180 mls
