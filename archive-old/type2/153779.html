Subject: Help w/ my '78...

I'm hoping someone out there can help me.  *V e r y* long story short I bought
a non running 1978 FI bus and have been tinkering with it on and off for the
last several months.  I've been trying to avoid the $80/hour VW guy but this
is my final effort before towing it to him.  Here's what I know...

120+ psi in all 4 cylinders.
Pulled 3 of the 4 injectors and watched them spray fuel while turning over the
engine.
New spark plugs, wires, coil, and hot-spark electronic ignition working as
they should.

From everything I've read that should be enough to at least see some action
from the engine.  It has never fired, not once.  I figure it has to be the
timing but from the little I know it appears to be at least close to timed
correctly statically.  I used the pencil in the #1 cylinder to find TDC, which
was almost exactly where the notch in the pulley is.  When I hand crank the
engine w/ the distributor cap off the rotor aligns with the distributor mark
exactly at 7.5 BTDC.  I've tried rotating the distributor a bit both ways
while the engine was turning over to no avail.  So, where do I look now?  I'm
not sure if this enough information for you guys to help but I have done a lot
of reading and cannot think of anything else to test.  Compression, fuel, and
spark at the right time, right?  In my rookie opinion it has all this but will
not crank.  If anyone has any ideas of where I can look next please let me
know or else off to the professionals it goes.

Thank you in advance!  This VW thing is awesome but I would imagine it would
be much more so if I could actually sit behind the wheel and drive it instead
of just dreaming about it.
