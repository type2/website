Subject: Re: poptop hold down straps..  

On my '72 Westy I had almost exactly what Shelby describes - rubber hold 
downs that they use for Jeep hoods. They are shaped like a &quot;T&quot; with a round 
bulge just before the T handle. My hardware looks original and judging from 
some pics in Bentley's the hold downs were VERY similar to the Jeep hold 
downs. I replaced my possibly original ones with Jeep hood hold downs (for 
lack of the correct terminlogy) from my FLAPS and have never had a problem.  
I do believe that the new ones from the FLAPS are a bit &quot;beefier&quot; than the 
ones that I have seen pics of - could be why I don't have a problem. The only 
modification was to make a hole in the &quot;bulge&quot; just before the &quot;T&quot; for the 
rear latch in order to install the little metal piece that cams in to place 
on the roof. Other than that, I used the hardware I already had in there. I 
would probably go for installing another clip instead of relying on the cam 
latch. Before I forget... all of this is **internal** hardware, nothing 
latching on the outside. And, of course my disclaimer being that this was 
four years ago when I was able to DRIVE my Wetsy (soon, people, soon... :-)
