Hey kids.

Looks like I'm not gonna make everybus. sorry. sigh. a guestimated 12-14
hr drive from here and I cant get off work friday....that'd put me in
about 9am saturday, then I'd have to turn around and leave sunday
morning
to get back in time for sleep before monday.  Bah. Real Jobs.


So, anyone gonna come to busses by the beach/volks by the seaside? Thats
MUCH closer.

wish i could make it..
