Subject: Re: buying parts on net

&gt;&gt; Does anyone have any suggestions about buying parts f/people through
&gt;&gt; www.type2_dot_com ads?
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;     Just have them sent COD.
&gt;
&gt;No, I disagree.

Yes, the UPS drivers are not allowed to let you open packages and inspect
the contents before paying for a COD. If you're on friendly terms with your
driver he might let you do it but he can get fired for it so don't expect
it.

Things are to the point now, with the VW net community growing so fast that
there is always fresh meat for hustlers, that I would recommend that you
not send more money than you can afford to lose to anybody merely because
he posted an advertisement --unless-- that person has a reputation to
protect. Is he active in NEATO or LIMBO? Does he post to mailing lists or
newsgroups? Does he maintain a web page? Is the only point of contact a
&quot;transient&quot; hotmail account or equivalent? Quick searches of DejaNews and
AltaVista should turn up the seller's internet history if there is any.

Make a road trip of it and see the parts in person, or (the best option
IMO) ask a local listee to go check out the goods and possibly make the
transaction for you.

This is sad to have to say, and I should point out that even though that
classified ad board gets close to 100 new ads a week (and there are lots of
other good boards out there too) I have heard VERY FEW horror stories, they
are extremely rare, but it's best for the buyer to beware.
