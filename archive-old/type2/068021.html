Subject: Re: Looking into VWs/dreams/fantasy VW/bad husband

&gt;How many of ya'll consider it to be rude for a person to walk around another
&gt;person's VW in a parking lot, looking in the windows and ooh-ing and
&gt;aah-ing? My kids are about ready to disown me and claim I am an
&gt;embarrassment to them. I took the 18 y/o on a &quot;field trip&quot; last week to ogle
&gt;the faded red '68 bus I lust after, and she was not at all enthused. In

This is opposite for me- I WAS the 16,17,18 year old, screeching to a halt
to go look at the various busses in parking lots 'round town.  My dad would
jump out, too, but my mom would just pick at her fingernails (and hope we
wouldn't find some way to spend some more money on my car) while we ogled.
My friends would comment on how much better my dashboard was than anyone
else's (they painted it).  I don't think its rude at all, in fact I love it
when I walk out of a store and find a person or two looking in the windows
and around the bus.  The more I get to talk about Hildegarde, the better!
