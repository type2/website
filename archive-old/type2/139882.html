&gt; I have a 79 nus with hydrolic lifters an one sounds noisy like it needs
&gt; adjustment, Do it just adjust till I can just turn the push rod or is there more to
&gt; it then that?

top dead center for that piston, turn adjuster in until it just touches
the valve then turn (number of turns is a religous argument) but 1-2 turns
works no more than two turns in, I use 1.5 turns and it works fine
