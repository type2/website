Subject: Re: [T2] re: mech fuel pump problem

Hello Guys    Most fuel pump rods will come out about 13mm for the pump to 
work . It should also slide out fairly easy. It sounds like the rod or the lobe 
on the cam are shot. The easy fix would be to put a low pressure electric pump 
on in place of the mech. pump. probaly cheaper too.  Later and have fun  Mark
