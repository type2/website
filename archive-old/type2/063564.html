Subject: Re: My 71 likes to run 30 degrees ATDC. Help....

I'm probably like a wino telling someone how to quit drinking here, but on
my old '71, I prolly fried a head by leaving my timing overadvanced. This
was necessary to compensate for an overly rich carb adjustment (too much
fuel; not enough air)...that would be a BAD thing. I'm sure others are FAR
more knowledgeable about these matters, but I believe you should
investigate this situation. 

Another thing that can cause your engine timing to require a high setting
is improper installation of the distributor drive gear. If it's off by one
or two teeth, you'll think your distributor is at 30 degrees when it's
really at 12 or 18 or 24 (I don't know the real numbers).

One way to be more certain is to find TDC by the position of cylinder # 1. 
You can pull your coil wire and your # 1 sparkplug off and rotate the
engine by hand to the position you think is TDC; then put a long
screwdriver into the hole and gently rotate the engine a little more. 
Make sure you're gentle here, or you'll damage the piston or cylinder
walls). Did the screwdriver move in or out? TDC is where # 1 is at it's
highest point, regardless of what is indicated at your distributor. 

Hope this helps. 8) Joe (the worst mechanic on the list...but that doesn't
stop me ;)

&gt; Can I do harm to the just rebuilt engine? What are
