Who exactly are you, anyway?  Or do you need to hide behind a gmail account?

And your obsession with me is freaky, man.  You are one unhinged dude.

I think it's time for you to stop this.  &quot;Pronto&quot; even.

Hardly makes a difference does it? Unnecessary $50k Audi or
unnecessary $50K VW? Your racist remarks about folks who come to the
US to better their lives and the lives of their families doing work
that is beneath white folks for less than the legal, yet unliveable,
minimum wage grudgingly supported by the right wing for their own
political survival.

Dealing with &quot;compassionate (yet racist) conservatives&quot; like you is
like shooting fish in a barrel. Open mouth wide and insert foot,
please! The reason you don't understand is because while you've been
living at the top of the food chain so long that those people of whom
who you speak so dismissively, have just been struggling to stay
alive. You're so high up on the hog you can't see those &quot;below&quot; you.
Therefore it's easy and you feel no guilt for your racism and blame
those who call you on it.

I think Jesus wore sandals and by todays standards would have been
considered a socialist. Funny how the extreme right wing can spin the
story of the Son of God to fit their intolerant, racist, sexist, and
homophobic views when He preached love, peace and acceptance of all
people, particularly the poor and dispossessed. I don't recall Jesus
stereotyping people based on their country of origin, how much money
they have or whether they crossed a border illegally.

I guess you believe in the Protestant work ethic? The reason you're
wealthy is because God provides for those who are true believers. It's
the poor folks fault that they're poor, because they just aren't as
pious as God (or you) expects them to be. Not your problerm since
you've got yours, I guess. Screw them who don't.

Hannity, Limbaugh and your ilk can squeal about political correctness
all you want. It's just a diversion to stifle debate because you can't
can't argue your opinion based on the facts so you have to tear down
those who disagree with you because they call you on your overt
racism.

You'll never get it, bub!

You're right about one thing, I believe in my right to free speech and
I'll call you on your racist comments anytime you make them. You'll
have to do better than claim that I'm being too PC when I exercise my
rights and take you to task for your stupid, intolerant racist
remarks. It's guess it's tough to take when you rich white guys see
your old world order crumbling in front of your eyes.

Viva La Raza!

&gt; I don't suppose all the rich white racist honky's that drive Touareg's
&gt; would mind if I called them rich white racist honky's that waste
&gt; natural resources with their big unnecessary SUV's? Or would that be
&gt; politically incorrect?
&gt;
&gt; Claiming someone's PC-ness is a tactic used by extreme right wingers
&gt; to stifle honestly held opinions and debate on public civility, Mr
&gt; Ames. As in, &quot;ugh, that's too PC therefore it's not a valid opinion on
&gt; my racist comment that stereotypes Mexicans&quot;.
&gt;
&gt; Bus content! Leave it to some rich honky to say that his wife demands
&gt; that they be the first on their block to find a way around the laws of
&gt; the US and other countries to smuggle a Brazilian Type 2 across the
&gt; border.
