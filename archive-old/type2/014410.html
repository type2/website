Subject: front seal question

My 71 camper recently developed a major leak of engine
oil between the engine and transmission case. I pulled
the engine out and am getting ready to replace the
front seal around the crankcase. Upon taking the
clutch and flywheel off, I was surprised to notice
that the back of the flywheel is dry and clean.
However, the clutch assembly and the trans case are
covered with oil, as is the face of the flywheel. When
I pulled the pins out that hold the flywheel in, oil
oozed out of the holes. Is this what I should expect
to see with a front seal problem? (Also, it seemed to
me that the big gland nut may not have been tight as
it should be. I popped it easily with an angle iron
brace and a 30&quot; pipe on a rachet, and I am not the
Incredible Hulk. I expected this would take some big
muscle action.) Obviously I've never done this before,
and so am not sure if what I'm seeing is the normal
run of front seal trouble. I'll be grateful for any
informed opinion on this. Thanks.
