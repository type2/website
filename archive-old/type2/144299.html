Jules,

What Karl said!  (Thank you, Karl and Richard. I looked for that picture
but could not find it.)  As further elucidation, here is what I wrote to
Mr. Finnell earlier today:

&gt; If you look in the base of the dist drive dog and the top of the drive
&gt; gear in the engine you will see a hole in each about 4-5 mm in diameter.
&gt; the spring sits in these holes.  It looks a lot like a spring from a
&gt; ball point pen on serious steroids (~4mm diameter coil and ~2cm long).

OOK!

&gt; The key word above is 'between'.
&gt; Between the drive gear and the distributor shaft.
&gt;
&gt; The drive gear is in the case and is turned by the crank.
&gt; The dist shaft is in the distributor and the dog on the bottom is driven by
&gt; the drive gear. 'between' is on top of the drive gear and below the dog.
