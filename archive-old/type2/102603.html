Subject: 911 engine install on a 74 bus.

Hey all.

I am thinking of installing this 2.4 911 engine and 901 tranny I have into my 
bus, but I am still just kind of pipe dreaming about it.

I know I am going to have to install the oiltank and figure out a CV joint 
conversion, mod the tin,etc, but does anyone have any info on a 911 engine 
swap into a late model bay? There is a dead link on www.type2_dot_com

Also, I have a complete 914 2.0 engine I am parting out (minus heads) 
tin,FI,dist...all there. Let me know if there is anything you may want.

Thanks again,

Chris
