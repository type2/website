&gt; everytime I need to fo somewhere. I am an avid fan of the Muir family and
&gt; tried his solenoid bypass on page 446(25th Anniversary Ed). This did not
&gt; work. The lights come on saying that the ignition is on but when switched
&gt; to start does not even click to engage starter. Do I need a new starter or
&gt; is there another way besides crawling under the engine and triggering it
&gt; with my screwdriver.

Richard -

I had exactly the same problem until just a few days ago - the problem
was the leads coming from the battery terminals - I replaced all of
these, cleaned the battery terminals, and it was fine...

Hope this helps - ya just never know!

Jonathan.
