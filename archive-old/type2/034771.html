Subject: Re: Beatle motor in 70 bus?

On 1/13/00 10:08 AM, BAllen1754_at_aol_dot_com thus spake:

&gt;            Last weekend I had the motor in my bus blow up. I checked out my 
&gt;options and looked at my finances. I found a motor out of a beatle and I was 
&gt;just wondering if I could use that in my bus. I am aware that the rear mount 
&gt;is different and I found an adapter kit to remedy that problem. I was just 
&gt;wondering if all the bug engines were the same? And if not what years 
&gt;can't I 
&gt;use? Also I was wondering what modifcations if any need to be made. I am 
&gt;short on cash right now because of school starting back up and I am hoping I 
&gt;can get away with using this beatle motor. Thanks for your help, also many 
&gt;thanks to those who responded to me earlier about my engine choices. 

     The motors are generally interchangeable, with the exception of the 
mount. However, many rebuilt motors come with the mount points, might 
check to see if they're on your existing motor. As for the mount kits, 
Mr. Hoover didn't think much of them, as they use the oil pump bolts to 
support the engine, a job which said bolts were never designed for. That 
being said, they do seem to work, it's just not the ideal solution. I 
think the stock bus/bug engines had somewhat different compression 
ratios, but it probably won't matter to you. I pulled a rebuilt engine 
out of my 69 Ghia which had rusted to hell and put it in my old '70 bus 
without any mods, drove for about 80-100k, including the Inuvik run, 
before I sold the bus and got my '78. I did have the pre existing mounts 
though. Also, you've got the single vs. dual port intake situation, both 
work but dual gives more power which you'll want in the bus. '70s were 
stock with single, but underpowered IMHO. If you've got stock bug exaust 
you'll likely need to replace it, the engine mount gets in the way.

Good luck...


Peace,
