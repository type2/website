remember this is an automatic so it doesn't had a flywheel.
but you can use the teeth on the torque converter like ona  flywheel they
are just harderd to get to and not as sturdy (IMO)

&gt; the safety stuff. Phil

at this point I would yank it onto a trailer and tow it, if there are
these problems I'm not sure I would trust the fuel lines or brake lines
either.
