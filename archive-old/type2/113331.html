Subject: Re: [T2] CarTalk

&lt;&lt;This weekend on Car Talk, a caller was asking for input on a van she could
live in during an extended road trip. She was interested in the Bus and the
Car Talk guys actually agreed with her! I guess they forgot that the VW Bus
was #10 on the 10 Worst Cars of the Millenium
(http://cartalk_dot_cars_dot_com/About/Worst-Cars/results1.html)
-Eric&gt;&gt;

Yeah the bus was on the list, but that list was the result of a poll of car 
talk listeners. Tom has often expressed great affection for busses, 
especially split window ones. On this weeks show he said he saw a very rusty, 
rough looking bus on the way to work and would have bought it in a heartbeat. 
I guess there were enough people with enough bad experiences with busses not 
maintained coerrectly by them and previous owners to get the bus on the 
bottom of the 10 worst list.
