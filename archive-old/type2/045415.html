The partnumber for this spring is 111 105 233, it is used in type1 and 
type4 engines. I think it started out as a 25Hp part.

&gt;Mike,

&gt;I *believe* that this spring is the same for all T4 aplications, at least,
&gt;if not for all VW applications. It sits between the drive gear and the
&gt;distributor drive dog.
