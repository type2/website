Subject: Re: [T2] '71 vacuum canister 

&gt;rdr_at_austin.rr_dot_com recently posted: &quot;After reassembling the distributor, I
tested the vacuum canister by s*cking  on it and watching it advance the
timing plate.&quot;
I've been running a PO installed 009 dist on my '71 for the past 20 years,
but have recently acquired and cleaned up a stock 205Q to replace it with.
Everything looks good, but I'm wondering how to check the vacuum canister,
which is now off the dist. Should sucking on one of the hose fittings be
enuf to move the lever arm?(mine doesn't) Or is more vacuum needed?

You have either a bad vacuum unit or a frozen breaker plate.
It should move in either direction with only 5 to 10 inches of vacuum. You can
see it move by sucking on each nipple with not that much trouble. Remove the 2
screws holding the can to the body. Pull the can away and it should come out
about a 1/4&quot; as the plate turns. [leave the E clip on] If the plate turns
easily, you have a bad vacuum unit. It should have 853 on the arm.....good
luck finding another one.
