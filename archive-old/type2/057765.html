&gt; Hey all,
&gt; Just a question regarding the ECU, ...alert us to possible Y2K
problems.

ROTFL!  I'll be sure to be out driving my '71 at 23:59:59 on 12/31/99
just so
that I can keep driving down the street after all the computerized
cars shut down :)

Last time I checked, there's no way to input the date into my points
and condenser, and my carb only cares if it is winter or summer.

As far as the ECU goes, it is a fairly simple device that also doesn't
care about the date.  You shouldn't have any problems.

This brings up another interesting question.  Is the ECU that is
commonly used in buses a digital device, or is the circuitry analog in
nature?  &quot;Modern&quot; ECUs are full-blown computers with CPU, memory, I/O,
etc, but I doubt that mid-1970s ECUs were that sophisticated.

Just in case, if you have a &quot;modern&quot; car you should set the clock back
before driving out to confront the Millenium! &lt;g&gt;

PS:  I predict that the Y2K bug will surpass &quot;It was lost in the mail&quot;
as the most used excuse for not getting promised work done, deliveries
made, etc.  You read it here first!
