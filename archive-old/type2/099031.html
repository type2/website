Subject: Still won't start 75 bus- 2 injector questions-

The 75 bus will still not start, and I did properly check the fuel
pressure (40, with or without vac hose on the regulator, but it drops
when cranking stops-seems high, but shoulsn't prevent starting?).  I
checked the injectors with a test light and they do flicker when the
leads are inserted into both plug connectors.  What's odd is that
checking the light from ground to either plug tertminal (ignition on
only) shows + current to each one- how can this be if the terminals are
for the solenoid in the injector?  Injectors show ok resistance across
terminals so I assume there is no discontinuity.  Is it possible all 4
injectors are blocked (did have old stabilized gas in lines for about 7
years, and it did start poorly in the past.)-  I have spare injectors
and thought I'd try this as a diagnosis- hook up a spare injector to
fuel rail TEE.  Attach the nearest injector plug.  Crank.  If all else
is proper, it should show a spray pattern?
