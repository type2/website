Subject: bus won't run (will start)

Hi all,

Well I have been spending quality time under the bus again and have a 
head scratcher.  I just put the engine back in after a head replacement 
(dropped valve seat).  The engine starts easily but dies as soon as the 
key is returned to the normal (not start) position.  This is a '76 with 
fuel injection (2000cc) and I think I have everything hooked up right.

I think the reason it is starting is that the cold start valve is 
functioning.  The reason I think it dies is because the main injectors 
are not firing.  I am going to go through the whole wiring in the 
engine bay this afternoon but I thought I would appeal to the mercy of 
the list and see if someone would point me in the right direction.

Thanks in advance,

Dave Williams
