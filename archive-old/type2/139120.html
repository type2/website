&gt; Now I should probably weld a repair, but I'm not set up to do so.
&gt; Anyway, this looks like a suitable candidate for a fiberglass repair.
&gt; It will hardly be visible, and there's very little structural work it
&gt; has to do except be stiff enough to be a flange. So what's a good way
&gt; to get that stiffness? Fold a piece of steel the width of the part that
&gt; folds back, cut to the radius, into the glass? Anyone have a better
&gt; idea?

Not an answer to the exact question, but my '79 bus had AC and the hacked
part. I fixed it by cutting a piece out of a junkyard bus and carefully
patching it in. I braised it with my little portable torch. I remember being
at the junkyard and the guys there could not believe I was borrowing the
cutting torch and cutting a piece out of the engine bay of a junker, and
that was going to PAY for it. But it made the repair much easier to have the
right shaped steel piece.
