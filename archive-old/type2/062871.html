Subject: Re: F.S. Type 2 ambulance &amp; firewagen (fwd)

I just called on these and the guy's supposed to call me back. His ?wife?
didn't know too much about them excep that they're in good shape and that he
wants $6000 for the ambulance and $4000 for the firewagen.

Now, I'm poor. I have to invest in VW's in small doses...I have to admit,
it's hard for me to resist these. But here's someone's chance to pick up a
unique vehicle and a piece of history. I'll post more details after the guy
calls back.
Hope someone on the list gets at least one of these.

&gt;I am posting this for a friend who is liquidating some of his personal
&gt;collection due to too many vehicles. I have seen both vehicles and they are in
&gt;very nice shape and complete. what he is asking for them is very reasonable and
&gt;I'd buy them if it weren't for the fact that I already have 5 VW's.  
&gt;
&gt;For more info, pictures, and prices, you can call him at (610) 926-6031  (Pa)
&gt;and ask for Curt.

&gt;thanks,
