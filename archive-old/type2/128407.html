Subject: Re: [T2]oil filler cap seal

It's a rebuilt engine with new rings, compression at
about 120 on all four, but the blowby could be the
problem, he is running  dual carb's and I dont think
the crankcase ventalition draw is what it should be,
something to think about. Phil

&gt; If you are slinging oil out between the filler tube
&gt; and the plastic neck, you don't need a seal.
&gt; You need new rings, you have TOO much crankcase
&gt; pressure.
