Subject: RE: [T2]oil filler cap seal

&gt;From: ChaMoon

&gt;hey mike by the busboys link provided and looking at B it is between the B 
&gt;and the metal tube goes up inside there but i dont see it pictured there?

&gt;I didnt think about trying to use cork gasket that might work&gt;? i have 
&gt;plenty of that if i can cut it to the right diameter?

&gt;if you take the plastic off B and turn up side down there is a ring that 
&gt;goes in there like a little rubber ring?


Most FLAPS and FNHS(Friendly Neighborhood Hardware Store) should have many 
sizes of O-Rings available take your filler neck in there with you. I will 
check it out when I get home if nobody has the size by then. Sounds like I 
might have missed a seal. ;)
Thanks for the heads up if you find it before me let me know.

Later,
