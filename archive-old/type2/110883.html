Subject: bentley manual

I have or am fixing to purchase a bentley manual for all the stuff that i am trying to do to the bus...
so far i  have had success............
I have been useing type2 list,fullmoonbusclub_dot_com, and haynes manual not to mention the muir book....
I would like to know though if someone can get me a scan of the page or pages of the bently that refers to the replacement of the flywheel,clutch disk,pressureplate,rear main seal,shaft bearing....o ring.....
something of that sort...
i know may be a little to much to ask for !
i have tomorrow off and have to try to replace all these tomorrow if at all possible..
muirs book and the haynes manual give me a lead but anything extra i can get is fine for safety sake..

my manual will be here next week maybe ?
i will be more than willing to make a trade for these pages...
dont know what i got but its yours if you can help!
thanks so much!
