&gt; What do you call it and what does the interior look like?

I have TWO Kemperinks out here in Seattle, We call them &quot;Bestelwagens&quot;
I only know of one other in captivity in the western US or even all
forty eight states? My opening page of my website (www.thebusco_dot_com)
shows the '69 I use as a parts hauler for my used parts business.
I also have a Subaru powered '67, that a California highway engineer
outfitted
as a Winnebago, with sink,shower,toilet,hot water heater,furnace,fridge,
etc.
I don't have a problem climbing hills, but I worry about going down the
other side, it is definitely a candidate for a disc brake upgrade.
