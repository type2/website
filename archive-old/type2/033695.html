&gt;How do I use the irc.type2_dot_com ?

&quot;Irc&quot; means &quot;internet relay chat&quot;. Think of it as AOL chat without the AOL.
=^ )

You can use irc if you get an irc client. The Windoze crowd seems to favor
a client called mIRC:

	http://www.mirc.co_dot_uk/

On the Mac the most widely used client is probably Ircle; it is a bit buggy:

	http://www.ircle_dot_com/

or, try Homer, which is stabler but overly precious:

	http://www.ex.ac_dot_uk/~jastaple/irc/homer.html


Set your client up to connect to the server &quot;irc.type2_dot_com&quot;. By default
people gather in channel #buslist but you can make any rooms you like.

For the sake of system security and our sanity the irc server is not
connected to an irc network, you can only connect straight to it.
