Subject: Re: [T2] How rare is rare???

Everyone forgot the funky colored/made seats too.  And the
vinyl on the walls had &quot;chrome tape&quot; on them.

I have one and those two things look to be the hardest to replace.

Cheers, dave

&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Don't know if you could get the sunroof or not in a Champagne Edition (also
&gt; 
&gt; known at my house as a Cow Poop Edition 'cause there is SO much brown!
&gt; &lt;grin&gt;).
&gt; 
&gt; As for the air - just look around for the under dash unit. None of the
&gt; North American busses came with factory air - it was all dealer installed
&gt; using VWoA approved aftermarket suppliers.
&gt; 
&gt; If you use one of these units you need to update it anyhow so only the
&gt; visible portion is really important.
&gt; 
&gt; The compressor needs to be converted to a Sankyo rotary which uses ALOT
&gt; less HP than the old piston compressor.
&gt; 
&gt; That will require a whole other bracket.
&gt; 
&gt; Also the dryer will require replacement.
&gt; 
&gt; The Evaporators (the outside portion of the coils - don't be surprised if
&gt; it is called a condenser - I ALWAYS get them backwards, can't make it stick
&gt; 
&gt; in my head) can be reused if they are in good condition.
&gt; 
&gt; ALL of the hoses will have to be replaced.
&gt; 
&gt; You need to talk to an a/c specialist to see if they recommend R-12 (no
&gt; longer produced and very $$$) or a replacement gas such as Freeze-12
&gt; (supposed to be able to replace or mix with R-12) or R-134a - the current
&gt; gas in the newer cars.
&gt; 
&gt; Do not use one of the flammable replacement gasses. It shouldn't ever cause
&gt; 
&gt; a problem - but if it did or if you were in a collision - - - what would
&gt; happen? We at least know there would be a CHANCE of fire even if I was
&gt; unlikely. With a regular Freon you know there could never be a fire caused
&gt; by the refrigerant in your system. I have not seen any crash tests - I'm
&gt; just theorizing here.
&gt; 
&gt; It isn't a difficult system to install IF you study and IF you are lucky
&gt; enough to remove the system yourself - noting the locations of the system
&gt; components. In theory you could install the system yourself and take it to
&gt; be gassed by a local tech.
&gt; 
&gt; One more comment on the Champagne Edition. It was a trim package - nothing
&gt; more. It was colors and chrome bumpers. Chrome replacement bumpers are easy
&gt; 
&gt; to get, just add the rubber impact strip, and then use brown vinyl dye to
&gt; make your black dash and steering wheel brown. I recently took my brown
&gt; Champagne Edition and changed it's colors to greys and blacks (modern,
&gt; plain, neutral colors) because I tired of the brown which was fading to
&gt; black anyhow. In my observations - the Champagne Edition simply substitutes
&gt; 
&gt; brown vinyl and plastic parts for black ones found in standard busses.
&gt; 
&gt; Don't buy the dyes in the typical FLAPS. There are better dyes to be had at
&gt; 
&gt; the auto body suppliers which cover better and are more durable. $5-$7.50 a
&gt; 
&gt; can in a variety of colors. Scrub all the vinyl with mineral spirits. It
&gt; won't damage the vinyl. Don't immerse or soak the vinyl. This removes the
&gt; silicone Armour-All (or whatever brands you used) and any body grease from
&gt; your sweaty hands. Once all is perfectly clean - your white rag is still
&gt; clean after a hard scrub, then allow the mineral spirits to evaporate. Then
&gt; 
&gt; go over the parts with a clean rag (new rag) with lacquer thinner on it.
&gt; This can affect the vinyl so just make light wiping motions. This is only
&gt; to clean off the mineral spirits which is quite oily and often will react
&gt; with dyes and paints. If you need to clean the parts again - restart the
&gt; process. Let completely dry.
&gt; 
&gt; VW vans only came with black and brown dashes for many years. Break out of
&gt; the box and change it's color. Try something different. In 10 years when
&gt; you tire of it or want to restore the van to OEM factory perfect you can
&gt; just re-dye the parts all over again. No harm done.
&gt; 
&gt; Lastly I recommend removing the dash from the vehicle b/c it makes the
&gt; process so much more complete and  professional looking. This dye works on
&gt; plastic and vinyl interchangably.
&gt; 
&gt; The dash will also separate into vinyl and steel portions which you need to
&gt; 
&gt; do b/c the dye does not work on steel and paint does not work on vinyl.
&gt; 
&gt; Good luck.
