Dear Courtney,

To help you out i'd have to know which kind of engine has your 77'. Does it 
come with a upright blowerhousing or does it have the fan mounted on the 
front side of the engine (pancake engine). Also i need to know your cc's to 
tell you exactly how to get your alternator out. If you have an upright 
blowerhaousing it's gonna be pretty easy. Take of the belt by puting one big 
screwdriver behind the pulley of your alternator. Care! don't push the 
screwdriver into the alternator or some of the wires will peal and leak 
courent, i mean power and you may get a short circuit. Well, with the 
screwdriver behind the pulley you'll take a 22' metric key and loose the 
screw thats on the frontside of the alternator pulley. Take the pulley off 
and than you'll se some kind of a metal belt that goes around the alternator 
and round the pedestal off the alternator. Loose the screw on that belt and 
push it back toward the blowerhousing than you can take the alternator of 
the pedestal. Tear down the alternator on a pancake engine is kind of more 
dificult so write me a mail cause i don't wonna waste more bandwith here...

Good luck
Michel
