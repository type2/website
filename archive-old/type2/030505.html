Allright, I'm stumped.

Engine: 1800 Type IV, dual Solex carbs, stock distributor. EGR is in
place, but exhaust afterburning (e.g. air injection) has been removed.

Symptom: After running just fine for months, suddenly started &quot;stumbling&quot;
at mid-throttle.

Compression: 135 - 145 psi on all cylinders.
Plugs gapped, appearance is great.
Valves adjusted.
Timing and dwell are correct.
Firing order is correct.

#3 fails the sparkplug isolation test (pull plug wire, look for RPM drop.)
#'s 1, 2, and 4 each produce 200-300 rpm drop, pulling #3 produces no
discernable difference at all.

Replaced #3 plug, wire, cap and rotor too. No difference. Checked to
confirm that #3 valves were moving and in correct order (they are) and
have correct lash (they do).

Spark was a little bit weak, swapped coil for a &quot;known good&quot; one.
Spark's a little fatter now, but still no difference in behavior of #3.

So is there something obvious I've overlooked? All the ingredients for
combustion seem to be present: the fuel/air mixture is shared with #4,
which is firing just fine; there is plenty of compression; and the spark
is working as much as I can test it.

The only possibility that I can think of is that the spark plug is somehow
being shorted out when it is installed in the cylinder head, but I haven't
been able to come up with a mechanism that would account for that
happening. 

Anyone out there got a theory or experience that might point the way?

Many thanks,
