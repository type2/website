. Conclusion?  You can only
&gt; buy junk to replace a stock exhaust if you dont want one of those 4-tip
&gt; jobbies or a custom look. Personally I'd like to find a stainless exhaust
&gt; that is well built and stock looking. Sure it wouldn't cost $79.95 but I'd
&gt; pay the extra and it would be cost-effective!

Jay, Harmon:
A few months ago Scott Fraser (splitty double cab w/ type 4 motor)
posted a link to a German site that had NEW (NOS) heads and cases for
type 4's. The prices were high enough and I don't need thos parts
anyway, so I almost blew it off, but the same site had CUSTOM STAINLESS
MUFFLERS for type 4's. They were a lot of money ($400-500 ?), but that
stuff is expensive. Also, someone in BC was making them for waterboxers,
maybe they do type 2's? Some time ago someone made them for 912E's, too,
which would be pretty close to the same thing. A quality product would
have to be worth 2-3 times what a stock one costs. (Would to me anyway,
gives me more time to lay under my waterboxers and get antifreeze in my
eyes!)
