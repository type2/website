Subject: '68-72 middle seat available

hello all

i am a vintage bus list-member. i recently found a middle seat for a '68-72
bus. it is in good condition, a little surface rust on the metal, one seat
clamp still attached, upholstery has two small rips, and a couple paint
stains. i believe the paint stians will come off fairly easily with a little
scrubbing.

the seats are white with grey sides. the white has a type of basket weave
embossing. the sides are smooth.

i do not have any need for this seat-i merely want to save it from going to
the landfill.

if you have any need for this seat-i will gladly trade it for any splittie
parts, cash, donation to the list administration, or just by asking
politely.

i do not want this, please come and get it.

i do not want to get involved with shipping-unless you know a very simple
way to do it.

i do not have digital pics of this-i am trying to get a digital camera-but i
can promise any pics immediately

I live in somerville, ma. just outside boston.

please contact me.
