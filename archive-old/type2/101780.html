Subject: Re: Air Bath AirFilter

Matt:  I'd be happy to stare at my air cleaner to confirm the
plumbing aspects of your post, but it is 7 degrees F outside at the
moment. Sitting in the comfort of my home, I can pass along some
notes that I have gathered over the years. Hope they help.

____________________________________________________________

The lower portion of an air intake assembly has two ports for hoses.
	one of these accepts gas vapors blown through the charcoal
canister and
	the other accepts oil vapors from the crank case.

There are two flaps in the air intake assembly.



Thermostat controls the position of the red flap. Counterweight + (I
guess) rushing air control the position of the blue flap.

At T &lt; 850, red flap is up and all intake air comes from down below.
At T &gt; 850, flap is down and intake air comes in horizontally. The
thermostat contains a plunger. When thermostat is cool, the spring
pushes the plunger all the way into the thermostat. When warm, the
thermostat drives the plunger out. This in turn pushes outward on the
entire spring assembly. This causes the shaft containing the flap to
rotate cw as viewed from the side of the air. Eventually, flap lies
on the deck of the scoop, blocks the hot air, and allows ambient air
in.

With no air flowing, the counterweight keeps the blue flap UP. This
means that the vapor port communicates fully with the engine. When
engine vacuum pulls in air, the rush probably causes this blue flap
to rotate down. Does it ever actually closes off the vapor tube?


The blue flap is there to close off the crankcase blow-by tube when
the airflow through the intake is high.  The weight normally keeps
the flap angled up, which opens the crankcase vent into the air
cleaner.  My assumption is that this helps to prevent detonation
caused by excessive crankcase blow-by.  It normally bobs up and down
quite a bit at idle, which is probably why folks wire it up.

On the '71 there are two connections on the air cleaner.  The one
under the snout goes to the oil breather (as you suspected)  The one
that comes off the side of the filter canister goes to the charcoal
canister attached to the roof on the right side of the engine bay.
Another hose goes from the top right side of the fan shroud to the
charcoal canister.  A third hose goes from the charcoal canister to
the fuel tank.
