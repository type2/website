this one is about to drive me nuts,  just replaced heads with some
rebuilds, done locally to my spec, also the temp sensor which was bad and
the exhaust system.

got her back together and she runs like she was right out of the factory,
with one exception, when I'm stopped in gear (IT AN AUTOMATIC) the engine

idles, then makes a small backfire, races a bit, then settles back to
idle.

no pattern what so ever, hot or cold...sometimes will do it two or three
times at a stop light, sometimes not at all. 

I have played with timing til I'm blue, have a timing light and she is on
the money, dwell is right on (pertronix) check valves, hydraulics but 1.5
turns from touch, where I always set em.  hoses checked must have used
half a can of WD40, checked all the wiring, tapped on everything I can
think of, checked all the plugs.

do have a VERY small exhaust leak to take care of but I am really stumped
on this one.  if I put it into N while stopped, no problem, but in any
gear even reverse the problem is there....really getting on my nerves not
to mention the fire threat.

ANY IDEAS, I'm open to even the wierdest right about now.

BTW, before I did the work on her she ran ok, but was hard to start
because the temp sensor didn't work, also the exhaust system was full of
leaks, but it was mostly PM not any real repair problem...now this.  Yes I
dropped the engine but have done it many times and had no problems that I
noticed.

HELP ;8*?

Thanks
Bob
