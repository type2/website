Subject: Re: [T2] taillamps

Shoplifting correct...
returns were either didnt fit in their housing,  didnt work at all, or 
failed after a couple of days.  Another item in the same category is the 
lights for the tire valve stems.

&gt;
&gt; Didn't work?
&gt; Not bright enough?
&gt; Didn't fit right?
&gt;
&gt; I assume by theft list, that you mean shoplifting?
