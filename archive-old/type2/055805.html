I'm posting this for a friend:

Listees,
I have driven this bus and considered buying it but I have too many
projects already. This bus has a tired 2.0L but runs well.  Leaks like a
sieve and you have to keep pouring the oil in, but doesn't smoke.  Don't
know where it's leaking from.  The canvas needs replacing and needs new
pop top seals as well.  The interior is very complete, but needs a good
cleaning.  This bus drives well, but definitely needs some attention to
the engine before someone runs it out of oil and ruins it.  The body is
pretty straight with surface rust mostly around the windows and doors.
Tranny shifts well.  Needs tires, has worn out passenger car radials on
it now.  If I didn't already have two busses and a Ghia project I would
buy this bus, but then again I find it hard to pass them by.
$800 might get it.
