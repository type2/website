&quot;Check out their web site and call 'em if you need anything. &quot;

I second that opinion. I've been out there a couple of times and the two
guys out there are honest and easy to get along with. They know their stuff
WRT VW aircooled and watercooled. Now, they aren't the cheapest on parts;
but they have plenty of good quality used parts for busses and vanagons and
even a fair collection of type3 and type 1 parts vehicles.
