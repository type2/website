&gt; A buddy of mine told me that the best way adjust timing on a Volks is to do a

The 009 is mechanical only so it relies on engine speed to advance the
timing. The best method to time a 009 is by making sure your total
advance is in the 28-32 degree range. That will help you keep from
cooking your engine. Trying to set it from a static point will not
always tell you what this max advance is. For instance what if someone
has gone in &amp; monkeyed w/ the distributor and the advance is much
greater than a stock one suddently you set it at 7.5 degrees &amp; it
advances to over 40 degrees. That much advance really can't be good
for a VW engine.

But I will say this. since a 009 is mechanical only &amp; doesn't rely on
vacuum signal it can be static timed if the real total advance is
known. But like I said 009s are supposed to be timed at total advance.

&gt; When I check this dynamically with the timing light, it reads about 9 deg
&gt; BTDC. (Presumably because the dist is advancing 1.5 deg at idle.)

could be, or perhaps it's the electrical/mechanical system actually
going 400 rpm that is causing the difference. 
 
&gt; Question 1: Is my buddy right?

no. a timing light is always the proper way to time an engine. it
tells you exactly what the engine is doing in it's running state.

&gt; Question 2: Did I do my static adjustment correctly?

I believe so.

&gt; Question 3: Which method is more accurate?

timing light.

&gt; Question 4: Is the 7.5deg BTDC (on my 009) adjustment point for dynamic or
&gt; static timing technique?

look here for timing a 009.
