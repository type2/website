Hi Jim,

VW/Wetfalia changed hammock styles around 1974 or so, you need the &quot;newer&quot; cot 
with the adjustable &quot;U&quot; channel poles (easily identifiable and the fact that 
they are finished in a glavanized finish) as opposed to the &quot;older&quot; black 
painted round tubed poles that you got. If it is any consolation it is a common 
mistake.

&gt; 
&gt; VW folk,
&gt; 
&gt; I found a child's hammock at a junk yard from an early 70's camper. After
&gt; getting it home and doing a fit check in my 1976 I found that the poles
&gt; were both about 1 inch too short to fit in the '76 mounting hooks. The 
&gt; hammock poles are both 55.5 inches long and the mounting hooks on my 1976 
&gt; Westfalia are 56.5 apart. Does anyone know what is happening here. The hammock 
&gt; poles are round tube steel about 5/8 inch in diameter with mounting tabs 
welded
&gt; on each end. The tubes are painted balck and the canvas is a brownish green
&gt; color.
&gt; 
&gt; Are the early child's hammocks different than the later (1976) types?
&gt; Any comments are appreciated!
&gt; 
&gt; Jim
