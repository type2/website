Subject: Mesh Screen for sliding window + seatbelt wanted
Content-Disposition: inline

Hi all,

I have a '78 bus with the sliding side window.  I saw a bus the
other day which had a mesh screen attached to the sliding window
to keep the bugs out.

If you know where I can find one or run across one in a junkyard,
please let me know.

BTW - I am also looking for the plastic that surrounds the front seat belt
receptacles.  (Just the plastic part that sorrunds the part where you plug
the belt into)

thanks!
