Subject: Re: [T2] Dipstick Thermometer at WalMart?

Good idea in theory Doyt---

However, unless you figure out a way to seal the tube to the meat
thermometer, the engine compartment will be well preserved with petrolis
maximus--

Just curious--

How ya going to keep an eye on that oil temp gauge at 60 mph??

 
I was walking through the grocery section of WalMart when I saw a
display of deep fat fryer thermometers hanging on a hook about shoulder
high. 

Haven't had time to start the engine and run any tests. Thought I should
run this past the people on this list and see if there were any problems
that could be forseen prior to starting the engine. Speak up if you know
that this is a bad idea and that the oil will blow out, or something
will hit the lower end of the spike. I have a lot of respect for the
experience and insight of this group. Lets hear from you.
