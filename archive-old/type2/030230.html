&gt; I've had the same problem with the 1600 single port van engine. The original

&gt; worked, but the belt was at an interesting angle.  It never fell off, worked
&gt; fine, just looked bad.

&gt; I have a trike now with the same 1600 single port engine(with the rear
&gt; mounting holes). It has an alternator I put on it, and the belt lines up
&gt; perfectly. I just looked it over carefully, and not sure what to tell you. I
&gt; used the stock tins. Maybe you should try your stock backing plate sheet
&gt; metal from the generator, sometimes that aftermarket stuff doesn't fit
&gt; right.

IF you had a 38A generator, you must change the fan shroud tin to use an
alternator.  The bus tin is dished inward, the alternator tin is dished
outward.  I _believe_ that the alternator tin is different from the
generator tin in all cases.
