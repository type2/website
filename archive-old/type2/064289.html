&gt; Thanks to Rick for his not-so-boring battery lecture.
&gt; One question remains though, if in order to recharge a deep cycle battery
&gt; it requires 1.25 times more amp-hours, couldn't this be solved by the
&gt; addition of a high-output gen/alt(Super 75??)
&gt; 
&gt; ernie o.

A high output charging system will charge the battery quicker, but 
doesn't change the basic premise... 1.25 (or more) times as much power 
is needed to charge up the battery. The Super 75 will have some excess 
charging power (which will charge the battery) at low generator output, 
but won't change the total charging time significantly (the regulator 
will &quot;chop&quot; off the excess, allowing for a controlled charging of the 
battery).
