Subject: New Idiot Book

Right now I am using my old 1974 edition Muir idiot book.  My bus is a
'77 so of course it doesn't cover it really.  Is it worth investing in the
new Idiot book that covers all of the air cooled VWs (is it called the 25
aniversary edition?)  Does it have enough new material to justify the cost.
How indepth does it go into the new FI system and the 2L type 4 engine?

I also have Bently, Haynes, and Tom Wilson's book so I have lots of other
references.

Thanks for your suggestions
Brett
