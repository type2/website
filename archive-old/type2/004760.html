John V. Ingram &lt;johnvi_at_cloud9_dot_net&gt; queried:


.....open the bleeders without breaking them off?  Could I
&gt;use WD40 on them and assume it will wash out with the brake fluid?  If not,
&gt;what should I use?  How can I free up the connections before I try to turn
&gt;them? On a Bus this old, should the brake lines be replaced?

John, I just did a complete brake overhaul on my 70.  Replacing the rubber
hoses at least is a good maintenance idea.  To get off hoses and bleeders,
use liquid wrench, not WD-40, tap the connections gently with a hammer and
definetly use flare wrenches.  I broke a bleeder valve but replaced all the
wheel cylinders anyway.  The tiny amount of liquid wrench that seeps thru
will cause no harm but you will be flushing the system anyway.  You will
probably need 2 qts. of brake fluid.  Good luck.
