Subject: can't get tranny into reverse

I have a 1977 bus that I rarely use.  Recently, when I moved it from one house to another, I found that I could not get the van into reverse gear.  I've had it for about six months.  When I push down on the stick shift, I can't get it to reverse.

Is this a big problem?  What should I look for to isolate the problem?  I have no experience with VW transmissions, so I'm hoping that this is something easy like a worn spring or something.

The four forward gears work great.

Thanks.

Regards,
Craig
