Subject: Vehicle Custody in Washington State. Any Clues? 

It's not really a Type2 question, but I don't know who else to ask, and
my web searches just tell me how cops do it. That's no help to me. :( I
live in Washington state BTW. (King County if that's important) Anyone
KNOW a Ricky L Koeplin (legal owner) by any bizzare twist of fate so
that he could mail me a bill of sale? 

Hey hey, I got this bus right. It was given to me by a guy named Elijah.
He never had it regestered, and he never had the title. He got it from a
Maria. Maria never had the title transferred or got it registered
either. She got it from Ricky. I called a licensing place and found out
that it's still in Ricky's name. (don't ask me how I got them to tell me
that) Here comes the fun part. 
 
The tabs expired in '97 so I have no reason to think it was stolen or
anything. Just like Maria said, they didn't do the paperwork right and
she's lost the title he gave her ages ago. So how do you go about
gaining custody of a car? My thought is to write myself a bill of sale,
and just sign his name to it. Nobody would be the wiser, but the few
people I've told said &quot;ooooh, bad idea&quot;. So uh, does anyone know how to
go about it &quot;the right way&quot;? Or have any idea's/suggestions on the
issue? 
 
Oh yeah, I checked out the address Maria had for him, and he's not
their. And the bus is coming right along towards running, I'm getting
close to the investing lots of money in it part, so I need that tittle
bad!
 
Kk, look forward to see'ing any responces
Chris &lt;don't wanna get the dog involved in felony's, heh heh&gt;
