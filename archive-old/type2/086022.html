Subject: Re: [T2] advice on what to do about a destroyed head and piston--75 Bus

Thanks for the thought... I will start searching for parts.  Anyone out 
there with any leads, please let me know!  Once again, piston, cylinder and 
head for a 1.8 l engine.  Thanks all!

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The valve seat on my #1 intake valve (75 F.I. Bus/1.8L) very

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; On the face of it I need a new head and piston, but...
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; is there any way to check without too much trouble if anything else

&gt; &gt; &gt; are those who didn't.  An awful lot depends on your financial 
&gt;condition.
&gt; &gt; &gt; If you have the bux ($2000 +core), then Boston Bob 
&gt;(www.bostonengine_dot_com)
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; spoke well of on this list.  If you are a starving student, then 
&gt;replace
&gt; &gt; &gt; that head with a good used one (~$50-100)  and scrounge a piston and
&gt; &gt; &gt; cylinder from sopmeone with a broken set (~$50)  YOu *can* replace one
&gt; &gt; &gt; head or even one P&amp;C, if you have to.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; if you really are a starving student,  I will give you a usable piston 
&gt;and
&gt; &gt; cyl for the cost of shipping, wish I had a head I could send you, but I
&gt; &gt; know I have at least one set of used pistons in the garage.
