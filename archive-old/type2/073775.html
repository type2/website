Subject: Re: [VB] Re: [T2] Friday musings, Buses &amp; Harleys

Well its still friday on the wet coast, I'll put my nickle in. First bike,
CL175, 16 years old, bought it without my parents permisson and parked it in
the side yard. Pretty much set the pace for the rest of my life. Haveing
worked in and owned motorcycle dealerships, I've had a chance to ride a
pretty good cross sample of bikes from YZ50's to 100 inch Harley's. Ends up
that things are the same as our buses, the stock ones pretty much run all
the time and the built ones tend to break (well except my built V-max's)
People pretty much the same too, from racers from across the pond to Angels
from 'Berdoo, they all wanna ride and they all wanna talk shop. Funny how
all my t-shirts either have bikes or buses on them and I have so many
leather jackets. btw, every manufacture has their clunkers, I remember
certain VF500's,TX750's and TS400's and a slew more. If you had one of these
and wondered why they never ran, it wasn't you ; )

&gt; Dave, list:
&gt; Gotta chime in here. I had a couple of Big Twin Harleys when I was 18.
Then I
&gt; wanted to go fast. Sold them, nearly gave them away. I can see the
parallels
&gt; between them and VW type 2's.
&gt; My dad is 75 years old and wants to sell his BMW. It's an 81 R100/7. The
bike
&gt; has 47k miles on it. And he's asking $2800.
&gt; It's a light silver. This is NOT an RS or RT, just a plain /7. But it has
had
&gt; good
&gt; maintenance and very light use. Too light maybe, pretty carboned up, but
that
&gt; should be no big problem.
&gt; Very little short trips/ commuting miles. Also very little two-up  riding.
Mom
&gt; has
&gt; never been on a bike, Dad usually goes with friends on Saturday mornings.
I
&gt; should
&gt; REALLY buy the thing myself. But it would be a tremendous lifestyle change
for
&gt; me,
&gt; having a bike that actually runs! I've got about 10 British bikes in
various
&gt; stages of disassembly.
&gt; We are in Waterloo, Iowa. POSSIBLY could arrange delivery pulled behind VW
type
&gt; 2 on a trailer.

&gt; &gt; Ok. Since it's Friday and all.

&gt; &gt; I useta own a Hardley Ableson.  A '68 Sportster.  Spent all winter
beefing
&gt; &gt; up the engine and it was running real good.  Until I got lost in a real
bad
&gt; &gt; neighborhood in DC about 3am and it decided to puke the engine innards.
&gt; &gt; Lesson #1 in heavy modifications - not worth it in the real world.
Lesson
&gt; &gt; #2 is don't go into such places unarmed.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; FFWD to many years later, tired of riding fast plastic but still riding
&gt; &gt; 20k/year.  Traded a carb rebuild on a 1942 Packard for a frame and 3
milk
&gt; &gt; crates in the corner of the guys garage.  Assembled a 1964 BMR R69S from
&gt; &gt; those parts.  Rode it a year, was &quot;given the opportunity&quot; to have to
&gt; &gt; disassemble it because of an accident.   Sold my GSXR1100 and bought a
76
&gt; &gt; BMW and have ridden those 2 same bikes for the last 13 years.  The 76
has
&gt; &gt; over 250k miles, and I still haven't had to open the engine up.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Screw the Hardley image thing, if you want a bike that resembles your
&gt; &gt; beloved bus look hard at an older BMW.  You won't be sorry.
