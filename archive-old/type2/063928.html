Subject: Worn-out distributor

thanks for all the advice about my distributor. I'd like to buy a new one 
and keep p my old one as a spare, but I'm having a hard time finding the 
stock vacuum advance distributor for less than $300.

I might have to join the 009 crowd for $60. &lt;sigh&gt; (sorry, Bob)
