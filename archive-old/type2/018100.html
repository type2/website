&gt; Did you get the heated Volvo seats? Now thats what I'd like to have on those

Yup, and they have soft/hard springing adjustments back and bottom!

I love scambling around in scrapyards and being a fan of comfort over
authenticity (saving that for when I win the lottery) I've just bought a set of
4 blue leather heated Jaguar seats for my Karman Ghia (£15) and a year-old set
of 4 heated Citroen AX GTi seats for my 'Vert (£20). A good scrub with
upholstery cleaner and the welding on of VW seat mountings from knackered
scrapper and you're away!

Volvos also have knockout gear sticks (stainless steel), window winders and
billet door catches. I also got a mint condition Motorola radio from a Talbot
Alpine for £5, oh, and I also salvaged a load of thick french-polished walnut
door and dash panels from a 2.5lt Rover, they are going to trim up the 'Vert
instead of Karmann's crappy plastic wood dash.

Vive la difference!
