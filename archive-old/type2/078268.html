Subject: Re: [T2] insanity approaches!?!?

How about a leaky intake manifold on just that cylinder?  It seems to me
that it would compress fine but make that kind of noise, but only on
intake.  By every crank, do you mean that you're hearing it on every
stroke (all four) or possibly just
intake?

Just typing what falls out of this ragged head of mine.

&gt; #3  when cranked sounds like the valves aren't closing, you hear an air

&gt; on the money and within a lb or so of the other cyl....?  if the cyl leaks
&gt; how does it compress??   was unable to do a leakdown test, for unrelated
&gt; reasons.
&gt; 
&gt;   now the hsssst hsssst hsssst occurs on every crank when running  the
&gt; starter, (I know it is #3, remove the spark plug and it vanishes) but
&gt; engine starts right up, you can still hear it at idle, but once the RPM
&gt; gets up the sound goes away....
