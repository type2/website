Subject: RE: [T2] Re: homeland.... now cold great white north stories

First(and worst) winter I spent here in Boise, I ran an extension cord 
outside from the garage - into the bus, where I had a ceramic space-heater 
and a timer placed in the rear cargo area of the bus.  It would run for 
about an hour before I left for work each morning.  Melted the snow and Ice 
off the windows, and made the interior nice and toasty.  I would just start 
her up and let her run for about 15 minutes before leaving, to warm the 
engine up.

Mine have block heaters.  Now I don't drive them in the winter so .....

Pre block heater, I would wrap rear of bus in plastic with a square ceramic 
heater to warm it up.
