Subject: Re: tight intake valve

Well, like I said before, the .004 feeler (smallest we had) wouldn't go
in the gap. I didn't do the valve adjustment last time -- my mechanic
did. And they put some stuff on the gaskets that turned to cement and
was a real b!tch to scrape off. I sliced the hell out of my thumb. From
now on I'm sticking with just a little oil on the gaskets to help seal.

I'll be doing my own valve adjustments from now on, so I'll be able to
keep better track of any changes in the tolerances. When I did the
adjustment in Texas it was the #3 exhaust that was tight. So hopefully
(fingers crossed) it's just one o' those things. But I'm keeping an eye
on it.

&gt; Like how tight?  If it was really tight and required a lot of adjustment to
&gt; bring it back into spec, I'd keep a close eye on it
