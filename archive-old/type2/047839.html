&gt; It also came with
&gt; a oil sump heater, and an external oil filter that uses the rear (RIR)
&gt; pressure regulator/releif valve(?) as a return. Anyone ever seen one of
&gt; these before?

I saw the relief valve as a return passage in Bugpack's catalog # 23, their part
# 3059.  First time I've seen one.  The description describes the unit as
replacing the spring and plunger.  I looked at the schematic view of the oiling
system in the Bentley. The purpose of the oil pressure relief valve at the rear
of the engine is to control the amount of oil bypassing or flowing through the
stock oil cooler based upon oil temperature/viscosity.  If the stock cooler was
blocked off and an external cooler used, I think this routing would work.
However, using this return with the stock cooler, I think the oil cooler would
always be bypassed and this may be the cause of the knock you mention. The 73
type 1 I just disassembled had a VDO oil temp sender in that hole, with the
stock spring and plunger..

The front oil pressure control valve in 71 and newer engines controls the
maximum oil pressure reaching the bearings.
