I had the same thing happen to my 1971...it was the oil cooler seals. They were leaking. EXPENSIVE??!!

Thanks to all who have replied to my earlier questions.

Now here is another.  After driving around for a day, I now have a film
of oil on the back of the bus.  I did not notice it smoking, but the oil
is coming from somewhere.
What do I need to look at now.  I took her by my VW mechanic and he said
he does not work on any busses newer than 1971, so I am back at square
one.  I have one other place to check before I bite the bullet and go to
the VW dealership.

Any ideas on what I am up against?

thanks,
