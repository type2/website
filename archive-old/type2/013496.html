Subject: RE:The Dreaded Hesitation Revisited

Hi Steve -
I can't comment on the Brake/Alt light thing, as that's beyond my
experience.  However, about the hesitation: Awhile back I was having the
same problem - halfway through acceleration in all gears (especially 2nd)
my bus felt like it couldn't get any gas.  It would accelerate and then it
would just fall away and lose power as if someone flipped a switch in there
somewhere.  At first I thought this was a classic fuel filter fix - I
hadn't changed mine for awhile.  But, a new one had no effect at all.  I
found nothing else wrong - no vacuum leaks, no severed fuel lines, nothing.
 Finally it got so bad that I could barely drive her, so I dejectedly
limped her in to my trusty German shop.  From them I found out that my fuel
tank was clogged, probably due to pieces of my deteriorated fuel filler
neck floating around in there.  They were able to drain the tank &amp; blow out
the clog with compressed air, but also said that I would need to clean or
replace the tank to fully remedy the problem.  Until then, I need to keep
the tank more than half full to guard against the clog happening again.  To
this day, the pieces are still in there and I am still keeping the tank at
least 1/2 full to keep the problem away until I can decide what to do about
it (or until something happens where I need to remove the tank anyway). 
Maybe you are having a similar problem - you might try filling your tank to
see if that improves things, or letting it get way down there to see if
they get worse.  Good luck...
