Well, lemme tell you somethin, young wippersnapper. When I was a boy, we
didn't have no dadgum hubcaps. All we had on our wheels was *mud*, and we
were damn happy to have that! Matter of fact, we didn't have no gas
neither. We had to push our buses--up hill; both ways! But we were proud to
be pushin buses (and secretly, most every Buick owner was wishin' they were
pushin a bus...or maybe a Beetle). Come to think of it, we didn't have no
air in our tires neither, but those were the days when a patch would cost
you a quarter and air was free. Of course, you could buy a gallon of gas
for a quarter or a pack of smokes...so if'n you had a quarter you had a
problem. If you bought the patch, you still had no gas, if you bought the
gas, yore tires would still not hole air. Most times, we'd just go on and
buy the smokes and sit in the yard in our buses, puffin' away on the hot
days, too give out to push anyways.

Yep, times is hard for you youngsters without hubcaps. I suppose next time
yore gonna post about how yer transmission whines like a little girl every
time you downshift or you don't feel comfy running the bus over 3000 RPMs.
Well, shut yore yap! When I was comin up, we had reduction boxes and to
jest go out with my girl on Friday night, she'd have to get out back and
*push* my bus over 3000 RPM, just to stay up with traffic! In third gear!
At 65 mph! And she didn't have no choice neither cause I couldn't reach the
gearshift with that broke arm anyways. 

Yessirree. Just you keep up your whinin' and I'll tell you about the time I
had to fish my bus out of the Mississippi with nothin' but a treble hook, a
stick, and a short peace of 20 lb. test line...and I was damn happy to have
that!
