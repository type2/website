&gt; Same for most all alternators I have seen, although some of the Bosch
&gt; alternators on Euro marks do have a female hex in the end of the shaft, so
&gt; you can be pissed at the whole world of alternator manufacturers.

I am. Actually, I am pretty much just geneally pissed.  I think it's a
sign of aging.  Years ago, I used to get bored with my elders complaining
about &quot;the youth of today&quot; and &quot;That plastic crap that breaks in five
minutes.&quot;  I am not ancient yet... the &quot;youth of today&quot; is no stupider
than I was at that age (they aren't any smarter, tho) but I am aging.
The &quot;plastic crap&quot; cliche gets truer and truer with every passing day.
On a Barndoor, you could (back in the day) get a rebuild kit for the shock
absorbers!!!  Transmissions were rebuildable at home.  Yes, you needed
micrometers and a press but a bench press was enough.  On the '67, I can
rebuild a lot of the bits myself.  With the '80, I see more and more parts
that are sealed, mostly the FI electronics, but a lot of others as well.
Plus that damn plastic gear in the speedo (and other plastic bits that
keep cracking on me)  I did a bit of work with John on his Eurovan and
while it is a nice bus, it is *not* the car I'd want to learn on!
Everything is a black box and just has to be flopped in and out.

The initial attraction of VWs for me was that I could drop the engine and
hoist it onto the bench for a rebuild all by myself and actually *do* 90%
of the rebuild myself!  Moving from a Ford with a 390 V-8, this was a big
improvement.  These days, it seems everything is a sealed unit.  I just
don't know what the world is coming to, but I do know that they can have
my aircooled bus when they pry it from my cold dead hand!
