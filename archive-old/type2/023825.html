Subject: How long can a westy run?
To: type2_at_type2_dot_com

Hello, this is my very first question to the list.  I am planning a trip in 
August from Cleveland Ohio to southern New York.  Will my 70 Westy make it 
without any trouble with adjustments?  It's a rebuilt motor now, I did it two 
months ago.  It sounds great,  I have never taken it out of state before so I 
was just wondering. 
Thanks !
