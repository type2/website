&gt;When I calculated this first,,, I took into consideration Vw originally

&gt;the rear,, and 30 on the front for fully laden vehicle

Jamie, Two things to remember...
1. The inflation values given by VW are for factory spec tires on a 
properly laden vehicle, and
2. The more load there is on a tire, the more air pressure it needs in 
it to push back to keep it from flattening out.
Therefore, your fronts will require more pressure than the rears.

As for where you got the 75% ratio, notice than the '79 GAWR specs for a 
kombi are 2227 front and 2866 rear, a ratio of 0.78, very near the 
inflation ratios you arrived at of 0.75 (30 front and 40 rear for 
reinforced tires). But remember, that is for a vehicle loaded with more 
weight in the rear.

(Incidently, the '79 specs for the euro &quot;commercial&quot; tire (what we refer 
to as a LT, which you have) are 30/44 fully laden. )

One interesting note, the GAWR for the fronts of all '79 models is the 
same, 2227, while the rears vary from 2800 to 2866. Not really much of a 
difference, but I wonder why? Anybody know if the kombi's and delivery 
vans are set up with a different torsion bar preload? I don't recall 
Bently specifying a difference, but I don't have one in front of me to 
check. Curious.

IMHO, I'd think about using some carbon fiber somewhere in your camping 
gear, or at least put one of the kids in the front.
