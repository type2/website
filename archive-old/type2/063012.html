Subject: Re: oil leak and dipstick on '71 engine?

&gt;&gt;But it still leaks a little onto the tin around the main pulley,
&gt;collecting slightly in the well under the pulley after several days.

There's no &quot;seal&quot; there in the back -- there's a small gap all
around the end of the crankshaft, where the big pulley bolts up.

Oil out of here means that you've got too much oil in the case, or
you're parking the bus nose-uphill, or, I suppose, you're getting
a lot of combustion gasses getting by the rings and into the case
and trying to get to the atmosphere....

&gt;The attempt to closely follow oil usage is also hampered by its new trick: 
&gt;The oil line on the dipstick is a few mm above the fill line and stays
&gt;there. 

Does the oil smell like gas? You could be running really rich, like
raw gas was getting past the cylinders and into the case, or, perhaps
more likely, your fuel pump is shot and dripping raw gas down the 
pushrod that operates the pump and into the case.  The only other
liquid in your engine besides oil is gasoline...

&gt;
&gt;I've been careful not to add oil until it got to the fill mark, and then
&gt;to add a full quart, so I don't think I've overfilled it.  [The last time
&gt;I added was several weeks ago, and it's had light usage-- maybe 400 city
&gt;miles--since then.] On the other hand, I do keep the thing parked on a
&gt;hill, usually pointed uphill.  [I'm in Portland OR; the nearest level
&gt;place to park is 30 miles away.] Could that be what's happening here? 

Could be! I'd check the oil for gas by smell, and by looking for a
tan gunky foam on the inside of the oil fill cap. If it looks like
there's no gas in the oil (a bad thing, by the way), I'd try and
keep the oil level BETWEEN the add and full marks -- too much oil
is not a good thing, either, and between the marks is a happy medium.
You'll be less likely to drip oil out the back or blow the seal
out in front if you keep the oil a bit below the full mark.

Hopefully, your variance in oil level is due to the attitude change of the 
bus, and by temperature changes as well.  

Cheers and good luck.
