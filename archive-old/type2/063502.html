Well a couple of places but one is best, all the machine tool places
now days budget and otherwise, ie Harbor Freight, Enco, Harbor Tools,
and even MSC are selling some budget minded stuff, the cheapest of which
is Chinese manufacture, ratchet thimble style a 0-3&quot; set (3 mics with
standards) goes about $30, a 0-4 $40, 0-6 $80.  Now a friend who is a
machinest said the place he used to work bought a set of these from Enco
and used them for 3 years with no problems, they look sort of low
quality but are .0001&quot; graduated and held on National Standards Bureau
calibrated block OK for the time he used them.  However Enco and MSC are
now selling Polish made friction thimble style sets for $70, $100, and
$150 respectively (these are Enco prices which are the best for the same
stuff)  I picked up the 0-4&quot; set and am quite pleased, very nice
quality for occasional work, not quite the same refinement as Mitutoyo
or B&amp;S but with a set less $$$ than one Mitutoyo mic, hard to beat.  I
checked mine against the plants yearly calibrated cal blocks and all
were nuts on and still are.  A 0-1&quot; dial gauge will set you back
with magnetic base, maybe $20 from Enco as well.  I picked up a
0-2&quot; for $25, chinese manufacture, and am 100% pleased, as nice
as my Starret 0-1&quot; IMHO.

Cal 1-800-USE-ENCO to order or get a catalog, chock full of everything.
A definite thumbs up.
