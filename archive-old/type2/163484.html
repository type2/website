}}}My own '78 engine (GE) would make the tapping lifter
noise. From a  cold start to the end of the first mile.
Hot starts and running were without  lifter noises.

One time I let it sit without driving for two  weeks.
Shame on me. It made the noise louder and for 3 or 2  
miles.

Since February, I have been driving the bus on a  daily
basis and the lifter noise is gone.  The cure for my
lifter  noise was regular exercise.  YMMV
 
Guilty.  
I had hand surgery earlier this year, at about the same time that my bus  
developed a hard start problem, so I haven't been driving it much at all (No  
power steering + can't repair it if it breaks)
I think I've found the problem (FLAPS points), and my hands are improving,  
so I have been driving it a little more.
Might even drive it to the COVVWC show in Columbus this weekend.
