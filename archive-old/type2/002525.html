Thanks to you guys who helped me figure out what my bus is doing.  Now my
problem is finding the items described in the lean-hunting problem.  My
Bentley obviously does not cover my type4's injection (non-AFC) and I have
no diagrams or anything to help figure out what the heck I'm looking at
(this is my first type4 engine).

Mine MUST be out of a type4 car because of the oil-bath air filter setup
right over the motor and the topside oil filler. Also, after a FULL service
job by me last weekend, I found a plug loose- but I cannot find a socket for
it: it is 2-connector, and bound in the section of the harness with the
3-connector plug to the distributor.

So- does anybody know where I can get a hold of a type 4, non-AFC FI engine
guide?  Anything on-line?

Thanks,
Wade
