Subject: Re: [T2] Idle Issues

Since standard procedure is to adjust idle with the engine at operating 
temps, sounds like that is all you need to do. Are you saying you have the 
throttle plate adjusted to spec and the idle screw all the way out and it 
still won't idle???

Verify compression, verify ignition and timing, set mixture and idle per 
Bentley. If it still won't idle, verify no vacuum leaks. Could be just the 
manifold nuts need to be tightened.

&gt;Hey Y'all,
&gt;here's my situation: 71 Westy, 1600 DP.  Runs GREAT!  Holds idle nicely when
&gt;engine is cold, but once the engine get up to operating temperature, 180
&gt;degrees oil temp, it keeps wanting stall at idle.
