Subject: [T2] Little plastic sliders

To the collective:

I had a lazy (mostly) weekend in which I spent most of the time with Lurch.  
No major work (not yet) -- just futzing around with this 'n that.

I washed the curtains.  Hooboy, hadn't been washed in decades.  

They held together OK, BUT I'm out four of those little sliders that fit in 
the channels above the doors.  These are the original sliders, and I rescued 
two out of the washer and three out of the dryer.  I had sewed a few on and 
tightened the ones I thought were loose before putting them through the 
washer.  Anyhoo, the curtains, while making the wash water an unsightly 
grey/brown, are only a little cleaner than before.

The upstart of all this is:  does anyone have a handful of those original 
sliders they would be willing to part with?  Sale or trade?  Lurch would 
certainly appreciate it!
