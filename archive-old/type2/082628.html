Subject: vanishing fluid

My brake pedal when way-y-y down yesterday. I checked
the fluid and it was several ounces low. But I can't
find any leaks. (haven't pulled the pan under the cab
yet.)

Put more fluid in and now the brakes will &quot;pump&quot; up.

Linings in good shape.

Suggestions, intel before i start pulling things off?
Thanks.

(It's an old-school 68 bus, shoe brakes all around, no assist.)
