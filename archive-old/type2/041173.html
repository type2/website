Subject: To Flap or not to Flap?

If one where to run a 1700 engine without the thermostat connected would it 
be wise to remove the flaps.  My PO has left me nothing but the flap over the 
oil cooler.  I left the flap in place over the oil cooler but it seems to be 
blocking air flow to the number 3 &amp; 4 cylinders with most of the air directed 
to the oil cooler.  With the flap removed would the oil cooler get enough 
air?  Is anybody out there running a pancake engine with the guts removed 
from the cooling system.  I would like to hear what kind of results you've 
had.  I live in a warm climate where it seldom falls below 20F and have a 
progressive Webber carb without any kind of preheat hose.

Thanks
