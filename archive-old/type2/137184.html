Subject: Re: new Pierburg? 34 Pict 3 carb...

Hi Tom,

Just curious. What kind of problem did you have with the Bocar?? Was it new?

My guess is these are Pierburg Chinese made carbs, suitable for a 71 Bus or 
any dual port engine. I tried a Bocar carb and it was bad, this looks better 
to me. Merry Christmas to all type 2 listees!
