Subject: [T2] Learning to drive a bus
X-MIME-Autoconverted: from quoted-printable to 8bit by lenti.type2_dot_com id MAA50418

&gt;So listees,  I bet some of you have advice about learning to drive a bus.

my favorite tips are: 1) when rounding a corner - making a 90º right or
left turn in city traffic - downshift from third to second before starting
that turn. 2) don't be in a hurry for the sake of people behind him. 3)
driving outside of berkeley, his chances now improve that he's being
profiled by no fault of his own.
