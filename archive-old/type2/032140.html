Hmm, the stolen vw anguish and revenge bloodlust does have motivational
possibilities!
 Seems like there might be enough volkspower to do a weekend stakeout 
some time.   Bait the roadside with a vintage treasure or two and see what
develops.  If nothing happens, who can complain about staying up late,
drinking select beverages among kindred spirits, and hoping
for a chance to beat the living $#!t out of a would-be theif (or at least
see them get busted).      
 Still, I'm glad I'm in the unenlightened rural south. Very few vw
fanatics and, much to my relief/annoyance, no nighttime noise escapes my
paraoid dog pack.
