Subject: RC VW Splitty (Early Friday Fodder)

Sorry for the early post, but I'm not around tmw.

I remember a few weeks ago about the excitement when we all heard
about the large remote controlled splitty VW's running around the toy
stores.

Well I found em.  I have bought their stock and have 2 if anyone
would like one.  I'll sell em for $45 each, plus S&amp;H.  They were $60
each but we found em on sale.  I'll send them UPS or USPS to any
place in the US that you'd like.

We have 2, and the first 2 responses get em.  Otherwise they go as
door prizes at the next camp out.

You can see pics of them at http://hopkinsherald_dot_com/pictures/rcvw .

In that pic directory is a smaller yellow splitty RC that my wife
found and got me for Christmas.  It's a blast.  Like a cross between
a &quot;Fat Chick&quot; and &quot;Bikini&quot;.. LOL

Dave.
