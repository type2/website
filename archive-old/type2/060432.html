If you have Corvair questions join the Virtual Vair mailing list. I am
travelling this morning to Knoxville to pick up a Corvair engine for my
Westy vair conversion.

After consulting many people I was told to look for a 110 or a 95 HP
engine. The only difference is the compression ratio. 95 is better because
it will run on junky gas and run in the higher temps without pinging. It
was used in the a/c cars. 

The tranny of choice is the powerglide but since I despise automatics I'm
installing a 4 speed. The recommended ratio is a 3.55. A 3.27 is available
but geared high for busses and there are lower gears too. 

I don't know what type of engine everyone else is building but you can buy
a good core engine to rebuild for under $200. I found two so far.

I have seen the kit for $250.

I have talked to a couple of people who have done this installation and
have told me that they have done the swap without cutting your bus.
Remember, it's easier to cut it old than put it back so be sure that you
really want to cut your bus. You could cut the engine shroud to fit the bus
versus the other way around. The older splitties may require it.

I've disagreed with Keith on a few items. True he has completed his bus and
I'm starting my project, but I just thought another opinion might be good.
I have alot of mail saved up from my questions on the Vair list and would
be happy to forward it to you if you want. Write me off-line. 

If you want the address for Virtual Vairs let me know and I'll forward to
you the instructions for joining the list.

Take care all!
