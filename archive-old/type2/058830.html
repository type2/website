&lt;&lt; &gt;Just wondering I have a 73 kombi with only 1 (driver side rear ) red
 &gt;lighted side marker lens.  The other three are  yellow and reflective only.
 &gt; My question is are they all supposed to be lighted, red?
 
 I had a '73 at one time.  The two front side markers were orange reflectors. 
 The two rear ones were red lenses that light up.  I get the 'fast blink' on
my
 turn signal indicators when the turn signal light bulb is burned out.

Just something to think about, a friend of mine took to rear light housings
and moved them up front to the stock locations. He then put the stock amber
lens on them and ran wires.
   TA DA!!  Lighted front marker lights.  Looks quite classy and adds quite a
bit of safety.  Please check your local laws before doing this, but he gets
away with it here in Oregon and most american iron already has them.
     Peace, Love, and his bus looks somewhat majestic at night.
