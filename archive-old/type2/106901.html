Subject: ADMIN Re: [T2] Anybody need a '78 Bus for Parts?

Okay Look.

I already posted this once today so I'm going to dispense with the friendly overtones.

DO NOT POST YOUR E-BAY AUCTION ON THE LIST.

List policy prohibits posting E-Bay auctions.  I don't see how I can make it any clearer than that.

&gt;Hi Everybody,

&gt;it needed too much to make it smog worthy, so I have it on Ebay right now.
