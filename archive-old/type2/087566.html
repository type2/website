Subject: Re: [T2] diesel conversion (some questions)

Hi,

The 2.0 air-cooled puts out about 66hp and the 1.6 diesel about 50hp. 
As DT mentioned there are quite a few issues to deal with to do such 
a conversion. If you are adventurous, ingenious and a competent shade 
tree mechanic you may just pull off! I would be interested to here 
how it goes. There are some 1.9 diesels (NOT TDI) that were sold in 
Canada in A3 Golfs. Those motors are closer in hp to the 2.0 liter 
and are just a hair taller than you 1.6. You can get them in the US 
from Parts Place in Michigan.

Good luck !
