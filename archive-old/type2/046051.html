&lt;&lt; he only drawback I can identify is the very high cost of the gel-cell
 batteries... &gt;&gt;
thing is mine has a 6 year warrenty, haven't seen a standard battery that 
promised to last that long. It also has 800cca. but is is just an average 
size battery, unlike the giant lead-acid batteries with an 800cca rating. it 
did cost me $100 though.
