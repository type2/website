Subject: RE: Door handle installation

Yes, it's straightforward enough.
1. Remove the inner release handle surround (first pop out the plastic
insert with a screwdriver then undo the phillips head screw).
2. Remove the window winder handle by prying off the cover and undoing
the screw.
3. Remove the grab handle (2 screws).
4. Pry off the door panel (carefully).  There are 20-odd snap fasteners
round the edge.
5. Peel back the plastic sheeting from the top rear corner (if there's
any there).
6. The handle is held on by 2 socket head screws front and rear.  You
should be able to take it off without removing the latch mechanism.
7. Reassembly is the reverse of removal!  I think I've covered
everything.

If you want to replace the sliding door handle, that's much easier, no
panels to take off and held on by a single screw on the inside.

&gt; I've ordered some door handles and would like to know how
&gt; to install them. Is it a fairly straight forward job?
