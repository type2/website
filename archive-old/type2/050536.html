Subject: Re: [T2] type1 oil filters

&gt;The first one replaces the oil strainer cover with a larger filter type
&gt;element.  Granted, it hangs down a little further, but supposedly it filters
&gt;in place of the strainer screen.  Advantages would seem to be instant
&gt;filtering on an existing engine and no possible hose problems like with an
&gt;external filter.  Disadvantages anyone?

This one has really intrigued me as it is a seamless little idea, but
I see a couple of issues, though I don't know for sure if they are dealt
with or not.  Does it have a method to bypass that little filter, as in, if
it were to get full of too much crud (I know it shouldn't ever happen,
but...) will it still get oil?  Second, is filtering the suction side such
a great idea anyway from a restriction POV in general.  Most filter
installations of course pass the high pressure oil though so this isn't
an issue.  All in all, I don't know, neat idea, but maybe not smart.

&gt;The second item was a replacement oil pump with and inlet and outlet already
&gt;tapped and installed.  Seems like you just run hoses to/from2 your external
&gt;filter and your done.  Again, keeps you from a case tapping adventure.

All you really need is such a cover, but not a great idea, trying to put
too much oil in/out in too small an area.  They don't have a particularly
great rep, doesn't stop lots of people from using em.

Tap the case if you got the engine apart to rebuild, you should have
anyway to pipe plug all the galleys so what's the difference.  If you
just want to go adding a filter, I don't know which I'd be inclined to use.

Again I don't know either way, but some food for thought.
