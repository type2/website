 &gt; Thanks to everyone who replied so promptly.  I wasn't  clear in my
previous
 &gt; post. It is the center section, not the end castings that I found
different
 &gt; part numbers for '71 bus and '71 bug.  Any further ideas on why this
might
 &gt; be?
 &gt;
 &gt; Jack
 &gt;How about this ? The 71 bus came with dual ports, but the earlier
buses
 &gt; came with single port heads, hence the &quot;special &quot; manifold ?
 &gt;With exception noted for the difference in alternator, requiring the
 &gt;superceded part #. Depending on the choice or combination of parts,
 &gt;it is more likely that another dual port set will fit the 71 just
fine,  &gt;be it
 &gt;&quot;correct&quot; or not.

 Jack and Dave:
 John Connolly said it best- the power brake booster port. Most any dual
 port center section will work just fine, if you don't give a damn about
 your power brakes working! (71's did NOT have alternators, they did
have
 38 amp generators, but so did 70's and 69's and maybe 68's(?).They had
 dual port engines with dog house coolers and they had disc brakes with
 boosters, vacuum operated). You could drill and braze on a fitting a
 little below the carb, but it would really help to have one to copy.
 This was discussed at length maybe 6 months ago, should be in the
 archives.
 I have a 71 bus manifold I could photo and send a file  of if I knew
how
 to use my new digital camera. Anyone wants a pic- write me how to do
it.
 I can get the picture on the camera, just not clear how to get it into
 the computer and attached to an email.
 BTW, I'm NOT eager to get rid of the manifold, sorry.
 Al Brase,
 69 double cab
