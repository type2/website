Blake,

Ok, what you have, as Mark said is a &quot;cheap&quot; fan shroud that should still 
have a fan in it to blow cooling air down over the engine....the 
additional part looks to be a separate fan/cooler *just* for the oil.

And! in a dumb place cause where does the hot air from it go?...looks to 
me to go right back on the engine...this is *bad*.


Blake, *with engine off* reach around behind where the back side of the 
generator would be and see if you can feel the impeller blades of a fan
inside the shroud.

Ya need some serious &quot;original&quot; german metal on that engine in order to 
get it healthy.

Time for you to buy the Bentley manual and look at the pics of an original 
type 1 engine...then you will know what it should look like.

Cheers, dave

&gt; What kind of fan is this?
&gt; 
&gt; Whatever kind of fan it is, it didn't keep the engine cool enough. I 
&gt; did the dip stick test when I stopped. And each time it was pretty hot 
&gt; when you touched it. Not boiling hot, but very hot to the touch. I 
&gt; would stop for 30 to 60 minutes open up the engine lid and let her cool 
&gt; down.
