Subject: [T2] Stupid Mistake? Follow up found rods upside down!!!!

&gt;I'm the guy with no compression in a newly rebuilt (by me) 1600 engine.
&gt;Could the rods being upside down explain the problem of no compression?

While it is a good habit to aquire  ( installing rods with the mark up ),
i believe your engine's rods would work the way you installed them.
The type 4 engine rods have an offset which affects the piston movement
and serves to lessen piston rock. I can't find the source, but i believe
these type 1 rods are concentric and work the same either way.
Either way, they do not affect the compression, that comes from the
sealed combustion chamber. Zero compression may have been the
result of incorrect valve adjustment with the dizzy gear installed wrong.
