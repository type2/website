Subject: Re: [T2] 70 speedo adjustment?

oh, i forgot to mention...
i had wondered if it had anything to do with tire size because the speed
seems to be off at a ratio (less at lower speeds and more the higher the
speed)... so i should have also asked how do you adjust your speedometer
to read appropriately? i have heard people talk about it since i was
little, so how so i do it?

thanks,
chris, the TIRED one... sorry, bad pun
