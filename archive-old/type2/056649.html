hi volks, on my 72 westy i have a later (76-) motor which has the thermostat
and them flaps. the flaps don't move much and i think the thermostat don't
work either. would it be ok to remove them completely. i know they are to aid
in warming up the engine but as i live in sunny south florida the engine is
usually close to running temp first thing in the morning in the shade (it gets
hot down here). i don't think i need any of it but thought id ask before
removing.
sincerely, marty :)
