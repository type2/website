Subject: Re: [T2] Question on how oil bath filters work

&gt; Hello everyone,
&gt;
&gt; I just cleaned my oil bath filter.  Wasn't too bad.
&gt;
&gt; After I added 30 weight oil and reassembled it, I sucked air through the
&gt; outlet that leads to the carb. I expected to hear the air being sucked
&gt; through the oil. Like a bubbling sound or something.
&gt;
&gt; Instead, there wasn't really any noise, or resistance to indicate the
&gt; air was being drawn through the oil. Can anyone clue me in to the
&gt; function of the oil bath filter? Should I be hearing anything?

That's not quite how it works.  Oil bath filters work in two ways.

First,
air is forced to make an abrupt change of direction right over the surface
of the oil.  The more massive dust particles hit the oil and stick. &gt;

Second, the oil is directed through a mesh of excelsior or somesuch. Oil
droplets entrained by the air are deposited on the mesh and slow dribble
back toward the oil reservoir.  Dust particles stick to this oil and are
washed along with it back to the reservior.

If you hear bubbling, you have filled the filter wayyyyy to full!
