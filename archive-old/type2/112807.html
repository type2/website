Subject: New rebuild head-high compression-blaming the Solex

Hi guys, for those who followed my story /problem, here is the conclusion!

My last trip was a mechanical hell:
http://www.eurokitplane_dot_com/intro.htm

The engine condition after this trip (and before!!!!!!):
http://www_dot_desert2002_dot_com/heads.htm

Since then (1.5 month ago), i have rebuild the top end (checking crank 
and stuff), re-check the carbs, almost rebuild an 78 injection (not 
finish) and did many, many, many other mechanical stuff. (120 pictures 
will follow on my site), 2 good heads were rebuild by a pro including 
welded seat, yes, welded seat!!!! new valves, guides, springs.... and so on.

The engine was put back friday, started saturday and tested all day 
today (300 miles).
The result:
-2 intake valves had to be re-adjudsted, a bit tight (Back fire, now ok)
-2 pushrod tube were leaking, fixed. (most after market O-ring sucks!!!)
-Compression is about 135psi all around.
-Engine temps(heads) never over 340F (was always 420F before!)
-Start right away, cold or warm. (not even a 1/4 of a turn)
-Power is wonderful, i cannot belive that the 1.7 is pushing like that. 
75/80 mph without any problem.

I was blaming the carbs all along!!!! Well, they still sucks a bit 
but.............hey, they are not that bad and working almost perfect. 
Still, FI is my next project, very soon)

The conclusion, before blaming any carbs problems, check the basic stuff 
(Compression-timming)
CHECK YOUR VALVES ADJUSTMENT OFTEN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!, they can ruin 
an engine quite fast)

Thanks to all who have help fot the past month, i am now ready to help 
other with type2 engine (and many other VW stuff), like i laways did!

Cheers, Ben
