Subject: Re: [T2] Re:liquid repair for loose ball joints?

Quoth I: While on the subject fo liquid thread replacement, does anyone
know if
they still sell that worn ball joint tightener that was squirted
into&gt;the gap between ball and socket and set to a self lubricating layer
that
reduced play to zero?  Back in the 70's it was called Liqui-Seal or
such?

QUoth Chris Mills: Can't believe there is something like that out there.
NO WAY - not me!!! 
You're joking - right?

Quite a response to my query!   I rooted back in 1973 Mechanix
Illustrated and found the ad for SHIMMY STOP,  an Epoxy you mix right in
a cartridge, and then inject around the ball.  They did specify if was
for ball joints that were still within tolerances but loose.  It is/was?
a 3M product claimed to be tested for 7 years.
