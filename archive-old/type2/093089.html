Subject: Re: [T2] shifting

You need to do the full maintenance schedule for your tranny and then 
reassess it.

Grease the shifter, replace the shifter bushings, replace the coupler, 
adjust the shifter, adjust the clutch, replace the tranny oil with GL-4 
spec oil ONLY (GL-5 will damage it).

Then see if things have improved. Should be able something you can do at 
home and thus not a high cost.


&gt;Just recently bought a 72 van. Everything looks really old, like no parts 
&gt;have been replaced.
&gt;What I need help in is determining the cause of shifting problems.
&gt;At first I could reverse and shift quite easily.Now after about 3 weeks it 
&gt;is hard to shift down from 3rd to
&gt;2nd and 2nd to 1st. Going from 3rd to 4th no problem but reverse I cant find.
&gt;Is this the whole transmission or just the solenoid that needs replacing?
&gt;I also heard about those shifting couplers, can these cause this problem.
