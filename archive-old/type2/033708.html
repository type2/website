Wow. That was a speedy reply.

&gt; Most books say that you have to remove the engine before removing 
&gt; the fuel pump. I think it could probably be done with the engine in, 
&gt; but I haven't actually tried it.  You will definately have to remove 
&gt; that air duct though.  It's not hard to do, the bottom two bolts are 
&gt; removed from the outside, and the upper two from the inside.  The 
&gt; upper bolts also hold on the &quot;dish&quot; that connects to the air filter 
&gt; box.  

Haynes specifically says it can be done without removing the engine. I
think I removed three screws from the airduct from underneath, but it
is still stuck somewhere. I'll check inside, thanks.

&gt; &gt;* Any other reasons why my engine lacks power? I didn't check the
&gt; &gt;air-tightness on the manifolds yet, I postponed that.
&gt; 
&gt; First things first - how is the compression?

Hmm.. I don't know, and I don't have a compression tester. Any way to
'guess' around?

Thanks!
