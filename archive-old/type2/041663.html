Subject: RE: Advice on rebuilding twin carb 2L 1979

Lukas (and anyone in UK who wants to know),

If you want to rebuild your carbs it's not a difficult job as long as you're
careful, take your time, make sure you know which part goes where and keep
everything very clean.
You can get a gasket kit from most VW specialists, Just Kampers do them for
23.50UKP both sides, other places might be cheaper.  You can get needle
valves, floats and jets if you need them, other parts are harder to find.  I
got a pair of new carbs from JK last year for 170UKP (with the owners club
discount), mainly so that I could keep my old carbs for spares.  They may
still be available.
If your throttle spindles are worn, you can get them rebushed.  There is a
man called Laurie Ellis who offers this service and will rebuild your carbs
as well (he specialises in old Solex carbs).  His number is 01724 720553.
Of course, if you rebuild them, they will need setting up from scratch.  You
may want to get a garage to do this, you also need an exhaust gas analyser
as part of the mixture setting procedure.  Make sure your valves and timing
are right first though.
Another thing - if you are having trouble balancing, it might also be due to
play in your linkage (or too much beer).
