Hi Jan,

 Excellent information. Thanks a lot for writing it up.
 

&gt; Feedback is appreciated!

 OK :-)

 Are you sure about the offsets? My Haynes manual says that 
baywindows use a 41mm offset. I have assumed that the vanagons
(which have a bolt on front rim instead of studs) use a lower 
offset, too, since the alloys are ET30.

 The cross section for a stock tyre is 82%, not 75%, that is: 
a 185R14C tyre is actually 185/82R14C.

 You might want to mention &quot;Load Index&quot;. A Load range C tyre 
typically has a load index of 97S, whereas a load range D is 
99/100 (some run up to 102). The speed rating is obviously 
less important for a bus as practically all of them are at 
least &quot;S&quot; rated (112mph).
 
 The Fuchs rims you mention don't bolt up to a baywindow bus
as the PCD is 130mm and the offset usually a good bit smaller
(23mm?).
 Some (Not all!) Merc rims bolt up. I'm intending to post 
something about adapting some Merc rims for my bus if and 
when I get them working!!

 Sorry if this seems critical: it's intended to be 
constructive :-)

Cheers,
	W.
