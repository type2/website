Hi Volks,

I'm getting ready to pick up my second bus in Georgia and I am in S.C..  It
is a 70 bus and should make the trip however as everyone knows ^%it
happens.  So anyone along the way that could give me an emergency number in
case I don't bring a tool that I need or something stupid like that.

I will be heading from Charleston to I-26 W to I-20 to Atlanta then up to
the NW corner of Ga. Lafayette specifically.  And then back on one of the
next couple weekends.  Any help would be appreciated.

The bus is a 70 westy poptop. and will be a great addition to the family.

Peace
Jeff

PS does any one know of where to order the lens for the license plate light
for a 73.  I just ordered the seal and can not find the lens anywhere.
