Subject: Re: master cylinder leak

&gt;I've been fighting brakes in my '69 Westy since it's
&gt;purchase four years ago.  The problem is...the brake
&gt;pedal stops about three inches from the cab floor.

One possible cause is adjustment. You must back off
the hand brake cable adjustment before adjusting the
rear shoes. You only have to do this once. Afterwards
you can adjust the shoes for wear without fooling with
the cables.
