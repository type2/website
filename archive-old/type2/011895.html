Subject: Stereo install/electrical/insulation stuff (long)
To: VW Bus &lt;type2_at_lenti.type2_dot_com&gt;

Volks:

I just read through two weeks of digests and saw a lot
of threads on stereo installs and the like.  Several
people mentioned that they couldn't understand why you
would want a decent stereo in a bus when it would just
get stolen anyway.  Other people mentioned that you
couldn't hear the radio over the engine or shouldn't
since you should pay attention to what your engine is
telling you.  Ok, fine.  My opinion is that I love
driving my bus and I love music.  I'm gonna have great
tunes in my bus and I'm not going to waste time
worrying about somebody ripping me off.  And since
it's Friday, here's what I have.

To combat the pervasive road/wind/engine noise
problems in the bus (it's a 78 Champagne Westy) I
decided to insulate the bus ala Matthew Bulley but not
to the degree that he did.  Using the volume knob
methaphor I'd say his bus went to &quot;11&quot; where mine is
probably about a 6, maybe a 5.

Nose:
I removed all the foam from the inside of the nose and
covered it all with a layer of Q-pads.  You can use
Dynamat or any of the other products as well but
they're all very similar and the square ft cost of the
Q-pads is way lower.  Then I covered that with a layer
of Mylar NASA-looking insulation.  Then I filled the
large voids under the dash with some R19 fiberglass
insulation.  I covered the cab floor with a layer of
Q-pads and Mylar insulation and then threw the carpet
back over the top of it.  Can't even tell there's
anything there but it really helps with noise and
chill.  I also applied a layer of Q-pads to the wheel
arches and the seat platforms and put the rubber mat
back over top of that.

Doors:
I covered the insides of the doors with a layer of
Q-Pads.  I will probably remove the panels and either
apply another layer of Q-pads or maybe use some
spray-on dampening material.  I reapplied the vapor
barrier and put on the stock door panels.

Rest of Bus:
Since this is a Westy and I have to work on the street
I opted not to remove the sink/stove/fridge cabinet. 
Maybe someday...  I did remove the rear seat and
cabinet though.  I applied a layer of the double-thick
Q-pads to the area under the bench seat.  I didn't
cover this with the mylar insulation because I figured
it would just get ripped apart when I throw things
into the storage compartment.  I covered the rear
platform with a layer of Q-pads and the mylar
insulation.  I was starting to get lazy by this part
though and just cut a big piece of mylar to cover the
engine lid and didn't duct tape it down like the other
pieces.

With just this much modification I have seen a
tremendous reduction in ambient noise.  Note that I
didn't do anything to the sliding door which would
improve things further.  I plan to replace the door
but my donor door is orange and my bus is brown so I
haven't done it yet.

Now on to the stereo!  I have an Alpine cassete/CD
changer controller in the dash which controls a 6-disc
changer that I have &quot;mounted&quot; in the storage space
underneath the passenger seat.  To get this thing in
there I had to snip the metal at the front enough so I
could bend it down.  Then the changer slid right in. 
I just slide it back under the seat and you can't even
tell it's there.  When I need to change CDs I slide it
forward until I can reach the cartridge eject button. 
It doesn't move around much and doesn't skip.  I ran
the control cable underneath the front carpet.  I cut
holes in the bottoms of the doors and mounted some MB
Quart 160mm coaxials.  They sound awesome but require
amplification.  I originally ran them off the head
unit but it just didn't have enough juice.  I may
replace these with some 160mm woofers and put some
130mm coaxials in the front of the bus for a true
3-way setup .  I also have a Rockford Fosgate pre-amp
EQ underneath the dash which really helps with the
sound quality in addition to letting me match the
gains between the head  unit and amp.

I mentioned amplification earlier.  I mounted a
4-channel PPI Sedona amp in the heat sink/vent cabinet
for the fridge.  There's plenty of room and it already
has vents to disipate heat.  I am planning on adding a
fan to draw in more cooling air since this amp tends
to shut down on me a lot.  To power the amp I removed
the cheezy Westfalia power wire and ran a section of
8-gauge power wire up from the aux battery into a
power distribution block that is also in the fridge
vent cabinet.  From the distribution block I ran
10-gauge into the amp and ran another piece of 8-gauge
up to the front of the bus for aux equipment (more on
that later).  I ran all the signal and power wires
underneath the fridge cabinet and behind the
sink/stove cabinet through the spare tire compartment
and then underneath the carpet to the front of the
bus.  Everything fits nicely and is not visible. 
Normally I would never run power and signal wires
together but I was getting lazy by this point.  I
should point out that there is zero ignition noise in
the system so the wire insulation must be doing its
job.  I used 14-gauge 4 conductor Monster in wall
speaker wire that is surrounded by a thick rubber
jacket.

That sounded really good by itself but just didn't
have any bottom end so I decided for fun to throw the
sub cabinet from my now sold Jetta in between the
front seats.  It's a 12&quot; Kicker Solobaric woofer in a
bandpass enclosure.  Fortunately it's covered in ugly
dark burgundy carpet so it actually matches the
interior.  It's also really big so I decided to mount
one of those adjustable cup holder things on top of it
to make it a bit more useful.  This will be a
temporary measure until I can build an enclosure
somewhere else in the bus.  Maybe in the closet or
probably in the spare tire cabinet.  I dunno.  It
sounds awesome though!

I mentioned the extra 8-gauge wire that I ran to the
front.  I have some Bosch driving lights that I wanted
to mount on the bus but didn't want to try and power
them from the fuse box so this seemed like a good
solution.  Trying to find a good location to mount a
power distribution block in the front of the bus was
tough though.  I decided to be weird and I mounted it
to the back side of the washer-fluid bottle bracket. 
This way it's completely out of site and out of mind. 
I ran the power from the distribution block to the
driving lights relay and used a foglight switch from a
914 to trigger the relay.  Extremely bright with no
voltage drop.  I'm planning on running the headlights
the same way in the future.  I also plan to switch all
the interior lighting over to this power source as
well.

Speaking of 914 switches, they are way nicer looking
(IMHO) than the bus switches.  They have a nice rubber
grip on them like the glove box knob.  I replaced all
my bus switches with these and have been pleased with
the look.  The only drawback is that the 914 hazard
switch I used doesn't have a light in it like the bus
switch does.  I was just going to switch knobs but the
estuncheons are different sizes.  Oh well.

Egads this is long.  Sorry.  If anyone has any
questions about the wiring or insulation feel free to
comment/rant.

Bob J.
