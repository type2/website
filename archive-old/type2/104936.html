Subject: Re: [T2] dumb questions

&gt;A. Can a 1776 engine be run with a Solex single carb of any type? (I do not
&gt;expect screaming performance, and I want to keep it as simple as possible).

Yes - sort of. There is a range on a carb capacity (internal diameter) that 
makes it appropriate or not for an engine. There is a math formula that 
will tell. I'd have to get my Porsche manual. I'll bring it tomorrow if you 
like.

Engine that is big, small carb = engine with limited top end potential 
(engine is restricted just like in racing) and/or lean out condition.

Small engine, big carb = miserable fuel mileage, carb may not provide 
enough vacuum to correctly meter out the gasoline.

A center mount Bugspray (Weber) might be the ticket for you but the intake 
manifold may be a restriction. I'd guess it is.

&gt;B. Can a 1776 engine be retrofitted for fuel injection?

Sure. Check out Miller Fuel Injection or Megasquirt.

All you need is $$$.

Megasquirt is for people who are quite technical and Miller Fuel Injection 
can probably supply a bolt on kit if you have the $$$.

If you are afraid of dual carbs due to their complexity or cost understand 
that the fuel injection route is probably not much (if any) cheaper and 
certainly will require equal or better technical skills to setup.

I have had very good luck with Dellorto 36mm DRLA carbs on a 2.0 Type IV.

You've got to match the intake potential to the valve sizes to cylinder 
bore/stroke to exhaust sizes to really take advantage of an engine's 
potential. That includes limiting the intake and exhaust bends and other 
types of restrictions.
