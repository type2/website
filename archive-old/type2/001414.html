Subject: Re: [T2] Rebuilt Half Axles/ Autozone $99

Before I replaced my CV's, I tried to order 2 of the half shafts from
AutoZone and found they were out of stock nationally and awaiting supplies
from their vendor. I checked back weekly for several months. When they were
finally listed as stocked I ordered 2, only to find that there was only 1 in
stock. I ordered the 1, planning to replace the worst one on the vanagon.
When It did not arrive, we checked the computer and found that the order had
been cancelled due to being out of stock. I got a refund for the prepaid
order and got 4 CV's from Ronnie.

&gt; Lately I've been checking regularly with my local Autozone.  In
&gt; checking prices on obtaining various parts for my new 83 Vanagon
&gt; project I came upon the following:
&gt;
&gt; Late Bus thru Vanagon half shafts (axles) rebuilt......$99  ($25 core)
&gt;
&gt; I've used these before on my A2's and find they have worked well +
&gt; they have a lifetime warrantee..  New boots, rebuilt CVs on shafts
&gt; ready to install with grease.  Their warrantee is generous.  I've
&gt; replaced three sets of brake pads on my 89 Bronco II (400,000 miles)
&gt; on this warrantee.
