Subject: Fuse box and &quot;Rebuilding the Indian&quot;

Friday topics.

First, after considering options and advice, I ripped out the pdp (or dpd) 
aftermarket A/C in my '76. Discovered that the fuse box had been lowered 
by splicing in a 10&quot; piece of wire for every lead. And now every one of 
these has to come out to get the fuse box back where it belongs. 

Also, the PO installed a cruise control. Slowly but surely I am stripping 
that out, but there seem to be pieces of the thing and wires in every 
part of the bus. Plus, I am concerned that with the cruise, the engine 
may have spent more than its fair share of time lugging. Why are POs 
invariably pissants?

I took a break from the bus to read a short book, &quot;Rebuilding the 
Indian,&quot; by Fred Haefele. (Just published). It's about putting together a 
'41 basket case m#t_at_rc%cl&amp;, but the talk about parts and advice rings 
true. I recommend it for a late summer read. Only wish it had been about 
rebuilding a bus (Fred turns down a chance to buy a '71 Westy at one 
point in the narrative).

Cool it with air.
