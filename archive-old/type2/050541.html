Subject: [T2] need a manual for your 73-79 bus?

You can order brand new manuals for a bunch of older VW's,
unfortunetly they only have the transporter manuals for most,
the 79 is the only manual I think they have for the campmobile.

Best,
Christopher

ps - im picking up my new bus tonight!
the 76 westfalia!!! (name to come)
