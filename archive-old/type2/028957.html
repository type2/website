Hey folks,

We have changed our name in fear of VWoA. You can still reach the site with
either, BUStedVW_dot_com or BUStedBUS_dot_com, we'll phase out the VW. Please spread
the word. We also want to take this time and say thank you to everyone for
your support and feedback. We have received several e-mails from type2 folks
looking for parts and advice. It is our goal to become your source for bus
parts. If your bus needs a part, give us a call or send us an e-mail. We are
here for you, the 1968-1979 bus owner. If you can get your part from
someone, get it from us. If you can't get your part from someone, get if
from us. BUS parts is all we do.
