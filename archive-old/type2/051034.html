Heya everyone, thought I'd introduce myself and my bus, Guyute.
Guyute is actually a 1980 Vanagon Westy, mello yello, and on its
third engine, which hopefully will last a while this go-round.
There's just over 1,000 miles on the rebuild, and it's running like
a dream.

I've got some pics and stories up on my website...

The bus links are pretty self-explanatory... take a look :)  The
best story/pics, imho, is the story of pulling the tranny to
replace the front oil seal.  A messy job at best.

So, it's great to finally be on the right list (I was on the
Vanagon list for too long, listening to conversations about
Syncros).  Been lurking a little and it's great to hear some of
your conversations.  I drive at 55.  :)

Planning on restoring a 76 westy I've got on hold, purchasing in
the coming months, so I'll be asking plenty of questions you gurus.


Great to be,
Chris G
