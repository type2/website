&gt;Sure. True: Once I drove to El Paso and back with no battery. It helps to

You could push start it as long as the battery is not completely dead, but
if your alternator isn't working, running your bus will eventually drain
your battery and it will not push start.  The reason is that you need some
electrical power to generate a spark to ignite the air fuel mixture.  With
a completely dead battery, you will have no spark.

That's one good thing about generators when compared to alternators.  With
an alternator, if your battery is completely dead, you will not be able to
push start the van even if the alternator is connected and working, because
there must be power applied to the field of the alternator in order for it
to generate any electricity.  With a generator, you will be able to push
start it because the generator will produce electricity even with a
completely drained battery.  Did that make sense?
