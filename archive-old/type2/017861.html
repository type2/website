I have just removed the a/c from my 1978 Westy.  Is anyone interested in
it?  I would love to get it out of my way.  The compressor does not
work, (I understand that the newer rotary compressors are the thing
now), but I have all of the underdash parts, the condensor and the
compressor if anyone is interested, contact me by e-mail.
