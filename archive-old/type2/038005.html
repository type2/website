Subject: valves noise?

Did my first compression test today in hopes that it
would explain this ticky noise I was hearing from above
the #1 cylinder head. Below is what the test showed

1# - 30
2# - 130
3# - 95
4# - 130

I didn't get a chance to add oil to see if the piston rings
are worn.
I went thought the archive and found someone who said that
a collapsed pushrod or a loose valve seat could make this noise. Pushrods 
look ok hydraulic lifters are fine, valve clearance
set right, rocker arm looks fine.
I have a compression tester that screws in after I ran the
test I left it in and the pressure didn't seem to drop.
Would that mean the valve's are seating ok and not leaking?
Or is this idea way off?

So here is my main question

Could I remove the pushrods, rocker arm and pull the spark plug wire from 
the #1 cylinder and RUN the engine for 1 min to see if the noise
goes away? Thus letting me isolate the valve noise if that is
where it is from.

The only reason I think its not a piston ring or rod
is that I am pretty confident the noise is from the head.
