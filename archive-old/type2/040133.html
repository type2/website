Hello Happy (type2) Campers :-)

I'm just curious......

For everybody who received the 50  -12volt electric files,
which ones were the more useful ones in your opinion ?

I'm looking for some more that are more helpful for
understanding troubleshooting and dual battery charging.

Any specific requests for something  electrical not covered
well or not included in the 50 files let me know and I'll
try to locate it.

peace
