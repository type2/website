I thought it came on for a few seconds until the presure built up and then
it cut off until the engine fired or the presure sensor indicated the fuel
loop presure went too low to inject??

FWIW, I had been having a &amp;_at_*$ of a time getting my cold engine to start,
tracked it down to the cold start valve, got a new one and put it in,
still no cold start.????? now I am getting frustrated, two days of
searching, finally found that the cold start valve plug from the wiring
harness was bad, the female conector inside the plug slid back out, when I
put the probe in from the meter it made contact, but when plugged into the
cold start valve it made no contact....!  fortunately had an old wiring
harness in the garage (for canabilaizing, not a working harnes) so I cut a
plug off there and spliced it in,  engine fires first time, and every time
since.
  CHECK the little things too!  spent days searching took at least 3
minutes to fix.

oh well it was a couple nice days, got it done so it rains today!
