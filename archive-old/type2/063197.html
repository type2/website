&gt;
&gt;My experiance has showed me that most aircooled VWs (they are very 
rare
&gt;here in NY) wave to fellow Air Cooled drivers.  Sometimes I get 
carried 
&gt;away and wave to busses when I'm in my old &quot;Olds&quot;.  Never seem to 
get
&gt;a response.  Teenagers love busses.  The first night I got mine 
back on the
&gt;road a teenager asked if I wanted to sell it.  
&gt;Waving is very important to motorcyclists.  When I am driving my 
Yamaha I
&gt;get waves from most other Japanese bike riders.  No Harley rider 
wave
&gt;to me though.  Even if you make it so blatant, there is no way 
they could
&gt;not see you, they just drive by like they didn't notice.  Oh well 
when I 
&gt;eventually get my Harley, I will wave to everyone.
&gt;brett

I have the same problem here in NYC. I drive a Kenworth for a 
living. I also have an Isuzu pickup. Luckly there is enough red 
lights that I can pull along side and explain my crazy waves.   
And of course The other truck driver get puzzled when I wave at 
them when I'm in the westi!!!
