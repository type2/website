Jon, I wonder sometimes when people say this. I suspect that you are  
too experienced to make the mistake of associating a quieter engine  
with less power. But how do you &quot;notice&quot; that it has less power? What  
are you comparing, even if it's subjective and qualitative, rather  
than objective and quantitative?
