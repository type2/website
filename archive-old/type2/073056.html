Now that REALLY makes a lot of sense to me.  All I have is a 'click'
wrench.  Can you recommend a good dial wrench?

&gt;The &quot;Proper&quot; method of torquing is measuring the &quot;run on torque&quot; and then
&gt;adding those numbers to the final torque specs For example
&gt;
&gt;A bolt has  an 18 Lb/ft spec, it takes 4 lb/ft of &quot;run on torque&quot; to run the
&gt;bolt onto the threads. The aactual torque should be set to 22 lb/ft. With
&gt;this method threads can be filled with rt, and be torques EXACTLY..This is
&gt;the method instructed in Turbine engine school, and what I live by.....

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;And when all threads are
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;lubed w/ anti-seize, I have a better chance of getting meaningful torque
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;readings.  I just put a brand new set of factory 16&quot; alloys on my T100
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;truck, and I sure wanted these megabuck wheels to be properly torqued.
&gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt;Possibly not. Torque specs are generally intended for dry threads, and
&gt;&gt; &gt;slippery lubricants are fairly difficult ( i.e. impossible ) to spec for
&gt;that.
&gt;&gt; &gt;Chances are you have more pressure than you would like on those wheels.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Yes, I may have a bit more pressure, but I think I have more *uniform*
&gt;&gt; pressure than if I take my chances with the dry threads, which are bound
&gt;to
&gt;&gt; vary in their levels of corrosion and roughness.  Lubing them helps to
&gt;&gt; reduce the differences, IMHO.
