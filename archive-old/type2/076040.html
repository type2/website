&gt; Thanks for thorough comparison!  I didn't know about that article on the

&gt; the initial run because 2000 rpms don't properly oil the cam.  hmm..

I think that there is more than one way to skin a cat.  Indeed, it looks
to me like no two cat-skinners do it the same exact way, and yet, simple
reliable beasts that they are, our engines suck it up and keep on pushing
the buses around.  I love these things!
