Subject: re:To use Thermostat or not?

Jonathan asks the always asked question:

&gt;in the never ending rebuild of rumba, i now gotta decide to reinstall the
&gt;thermostat device which some previous owner took off the van. any comments?
&gt;i've heard that it's good to have it, and that it's good not to have it.

Where do you live?  Does it ever get cold? If so I would suggest to you
that you install it.  It was put there for a reason. The same reason that
water cooled engines have them. It keeps the flaps closed until the engine
reaches operating temps,  then opens to keep the engine from overheating.
The benefits are that your engine warms up quicker, the oil warms quicker
to optimum temps.  If your engine overheats it will not be due to the
thermostat, unless installed incorrectly.  They are designed to fail in the
open position.  If you live in a warm climate, your engine will not suffer
greatly for the lack of a thermostat, but neither will it thrive.
