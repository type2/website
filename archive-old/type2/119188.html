Subject: Re: [T2] Need definitive timing spec for early '76 FI

&gt; I recall asking about this on this list before, and still being
 confused by the answer.  So, I decided to jot down the part # for my
 distributor and post it here, hoping that Karl can provide me with
 suitable data to put on a sign inside the engine lid that will be easy
 for the mechanic to see the next time it goes in (two more
 warranty-required oil changes to be done by the shop).

 Bosch - 0 231 181 012
VW - 022 905 205 AB

 I believe that 5 ATDC is the correct timing spec for this distributor,
 since it has the vacuum retard that is going to be engaged at idle.

 ----------------------------------------------------------------------

5 after is correct, as long as you have vacuum at idle on the retard side:)
