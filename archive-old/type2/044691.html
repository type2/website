I want one o' those! :-)

Engine question: (1700 w/dual Solexes) No luck finding out why my right
cylinder head isn't pulling its weight. Changed plugs, wires,
distributor cap, points, condenser. Adjusted the valves. Replaced the
carbs. New rubber elbows on the balance tube. My mechanic is stumped.
I'm stumped. Compression is 128 on #1 and 115 on #2.

So he says I oughta start thinking about another engine, which I've
*been* thinking about, as my engine is a years-old SIR that's had the
heads replaced already and is of dubious history, since I've only had
the bus a year.

The local VW wonk tells me I should look for a Porsche 914 in a boneyard
and grab those heads (less stress on 'em), and rebuild my long block to
an 1800. So I ask the Almighty List -- whaddaya think?

P-mail me.
