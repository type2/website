Really upset to hear about this. Something so tragic reinforces the importance
of the AIRS list. At least there is a resource available for when you get in a
tight jam - you might be able to contact someone who's been in your shoes and
can give you a morale boost, or a little technical help. If the hat is being
passed for flowers or anything, I'd like to contribute. -Chris
