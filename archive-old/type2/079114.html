Subject: Re: [T2] Alcohol and Driving

David:
Brazilian Vw's are sometimes made to run on 100% ethanol.
BTW, this is different than methanol, which is what race cars use. Ethanol is
grain alcohol.
I'm sure there are engine modifications needed to optimize the ethanol. Jet
changes and timing at least. Maybe compression ratio.
Find the VW do Brasil site and get the specs.

&gt; It's not what it sounds like! Just a hypothetical question for the list:
&gt;
&gt; Would it be possible to convert an air-cooled VW engine to run on 100%
&gt; ethanol? If it is possible, what would be involved? Would it work on carbs
&gt; or fuel injection, or both maybe? Change valve sizes, material,
&gt; lift/duartion, CR?  Hotter spark plugs? Anything else come to mind? Let's
&gt; assume that the supply of ethanol isn't a problem and that we're talking
&gt; about a small fleet, not a single vehicle.
