Subject: Cool Discovery: Easy Hydraulic Lifter Bleeding
Message-ID: &lt;FFHDHALMDBDHCAAA_at_theglobe_dot_com&gt;

I'd like to pretend that I used my gigantic brain to figure this out, but truth is that I just stumbled upon a very easy way to bleed the hydraulic lifters. I was doing the pan-full-of-oil thing, pressing down on the lifter for 30 seconds to get maybe 3 or 4 bubbles out of it. VERY tedious and time-consuming.

But for some reason, I thought I would be storing these lifters for a couple hours, so I chased down some pill bottles just big enough to fit the lifters in. One lifter per pill bottle. We got lots of em.

Fearing that some air would leak into the lifter if I just pulled it out of the oil and dropped it into the pill bottle, I decided to submerge the bottle and cap in the oil and insert the lifter while it was in the tub o' oil; then with the bottle still in the oil, I closed it...well I tried to. Lo and behold, the pill bottle became a hydraulic pressure chamber. It became difficult to close, but more importantly, as I pushed on the lid and then released it, air in what I thought was a completely bled lifter bubbled out. I watched in amazement through the semi-clear bottle. Eureka! Easy hydraulic lifter bleeder. Just push and release, push and release. When there's a decent size bubble in the bottle, open it up, add more oil, put the lid back on; then push and release, push and release.

It took me 30 minutes to bleed 2 lifters the old way; it took less than 20 minutes to bleed the remaining six the new way.

Now, if I see any of you selling these as your own invention, I'll sue the pants off you--okay. Too many people making money on this hobby already. Sides, there's probably an EMPI version of this out there already...in chrome.

Have fun! Joe
