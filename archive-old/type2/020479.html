Subject: Free Parts!!-dont get too excited

Hey everybody, 
Today I finally assembled my new rebuilt engine for my 71 westy and I
found some parts I will not need anymore.  I have a German muffler for a
71 bus.  I used it for 2 months then my engine seized.  It has very
light surface rust.  I also have a complete dual port intake manifold
even with new  rubber pieces and a fresh coat of black paint.  I also
have  a complete 1600dp that is totally disassembled.  Someone might
need it for a core charge or something.  The everything looks good
except for the crankshaft which has to be reground.  I might have one or
two more things laying around.  Whoever wants or needs these parts can
contact me.  I would prefer if you picked them up or i can ship them for
the cost of shipping plus a small fee.  I live in maplewood NJ.  
Thanks,
Brian 71 westy
