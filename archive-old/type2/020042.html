One of the high milage tips I gave was to increase tire pressures.

I erred in calling my tires &quot;Load Range C&quot;.  They are actually a Michelin 185R14
C  6 ply rated tire.  Max load single tire: 1710 lbs at 55 PSI cold.  There is
no load range rating marked on the sidewall. They have a rating 99/97N on the
side wall.

On my 60 single cab, I have a set of uniroyal LT195/75R14.  Max single tire
load: 1435 at 60 PSI.  These tires are marked Load Range C on the sidewall.
They have to rating 93/90Q for comparison.

There is a difference between a commercial grade tire indicated by the C after
the wheel size, and a  Load Range C tire.

I could be wrong here, but I thought the tire design and construction would
resist the crowning of the center portion up to the maximum inflation pressure.

In any event, my tire pressure recommendations were strictly a response to the
fuel economy issue.  I have found the steering to be lighter as the contact
patch decreased with pressure.

Short of locked wheel skids, there should be little difference in braking
ability.  The maximum braking efficiency is found at the point of impending
skid.  This is why anti-lock braking systems work so well.  You do not have to
modulate the brake pedal to keep from locking em up.  Ever notice on ice that
you can be slowing down, but when your brakes lock up, you actually speed up
some and extend your braking distance?  In a water on the roadway condition, a
higher tire pressure will raise the speed at which hydroplaneing will begin.  In
a turn, which would be the most critical factor in front tire grip, you would
hear a tire squealing before you reach the limits of adhesion of your tires.  My
2.0L Westy does not go fast enough to reach this point.  If it did, I would be
driving way to fast for the conditions on the roadway.  I have been unabe to
maintain a 4 wheel drift on a clover leaf freeway ramp with my Westy, no matter
what the tire pressure.

It is, however, a valid concern as to overall tire pressure and vehicle handling
characteristics.  If you want to try it out, increase the pressure in 5 pound
increments and see how it feels.  I am back to the 30 lbs front and 40 lbs rear
as my wife really hates the road noise.

Thanks William for making me explain myself,

Mike D.
