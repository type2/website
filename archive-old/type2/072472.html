  Does the smoke stop if you turn off the heat?  No it does not.....the smoke keeps coming out slowly. The heat has been off (100+ degree weather in the last few days). But I did notice that it is diminishing slowly.

Could be gunk from heat exchangers entering into your heating system.  
Motor/exhaust warms up after a bit, gunk starts cooking, is blown into cab 
via heating system.  Does the smoke stop if you turn off the heat?  Could be 
oil leaking/burning on something/entering your heating system (via blower 
fan?/above tin, or under at...?).  Check archives under &quot;exhaust&quot; or &quot;heat&quot; 
and &quot;exchangers,&quot; you should get all you need to track down &amp; fixify.  If it 
is crud in the exchangers, a good cleaning agent &amp; garden hose can do 
wonders (I've just been down this trail...).  Some recommend degreaser &amp; the 
power sprayer _at_ automated moto-washes.  Some say leave it be, let it burn 
out, co-exist w/the odor.  Still others say replace exchangers (there's been 
some back &amp; forth recently about Dansk (sp?) exchangers, check archives if 
you choose to replace).

I still don't have my exchanger-to-heat flap ducts hooked back up after the 
clean, but I can't help but think it will make a difference (I'd thought 
gunk would be burnt up during a 1900 mile trip; cleaning showed me it sure 
WASN'T).  In my case, the insulative padding (material? - still don't know, 
someone said the material might possibly be asbestos) inside the exchanger, 
between outer wall &amp; inside metal covering, had apparently become just 
SOAKED from the pre-rebuild's oil spewing lifestyle.  My first few rinses 
produced an almost pure motor oil outpouring.

2nd) Why after driving a while, there is smoke coming out of the dash, near 
the windshield? It smells like burnt motor oil, or other oils.

Thanks to all in advance.....
