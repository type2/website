Could be the O2 sensor.

I know that my 79 fi runs real bad when I
disconnect it. Do you even have one?

Other than that, unless the engine hits the 200
degree mark, the FI system will run a little rich
to warm it up. Do you have a crank case temp
sensor
connected correctly. It's a brass like probe
mounted under
the left side of the intake manafold.

The only other thing is the Mass Air Flow Sensor
adjust
valve. If you have it screwed in all the way,
you'll run
real rich, I set mine about 1/8&quot; from the top.
Like half way down.

still trying to figure this engine out.  today i
did more and more checking,
starting from the bottom up and testing stuff out.
here's the basics:
checked compression in all cylinders, all were
between 120-140 so that's
cool.  checked timing statically(don't have a gun
yet) and its right on.
dwell is at 50.  i fixed all the vaccum areas that
i thought were in
question and i don't hear any major air noises
anymore (although there is a
nice flow of air coming out of my #2 cylinder
hole??).
so i thought that maybe there was a miss somewhere
ignition system, so i
started the engine and pulled one spark plug wire
out at a time to see if
there was a miss anywhere.  the result was
baffling, as removing the wire
did absolutely nothing to the running performance
of the engine (maybe a
very very slight drop in rpm, but i would expect
that removing a wire would
make a rather drastic change in idle).

so that's what i did.   here's the symptoms as of
now:  engine starts up
easily but idles rough (almost as if missfiring?),
there is lots of smoke
that smells like gas, the oil is gassy and reaks
of gas, and the plugs were
ALL black with carbon.

so she's running rich.  i don't know what to check
now.  or what might be
wrong.

and i found the decelleration valve and egr, it
appears my egr is not hooked
up as there are no hoses or vaccum to it....

what are the major causes of running this rich?
i'm almost there...i can
see the light at the end of the tunnel.......

mark, '78 fi bus.
