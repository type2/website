Subject: Re: [T2] waxing philosophic

Billy,

You are on the right track!  The only way to get nostalgic
is after you get &quot;character&quot; and experience&lt;VBG&gt;.

I once wanted those things when I was young...all it takes
is time.  LOL

Cheers, dave

&gt; Steve,
&gt; 
&gt; Just think how those of us who are in our mid 20's and share your &quot;do-it-myself&quot; ethic feel. How do you think we fit in with our generation?
&gt; 
&gt; The days you guys reminisce about were gone decades before I got my first bus. You have first hand knowledge of barndoors. I hope someday I'll be able to find a nice T1 bus of any year.
&gt; 
&gt; Some of today's youth IS smarter, and will have to have our busses pried out of our hands as well.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks to all of you who pass the wisdom on to the next crowd. We are listening.

&gt; Years ago, I used to get bored with my elders complaining
&gt; about &quot;the youth of today&quot; and &quot;That plastic crap that breaks in five
&gt; minutes.&quot;  I am not ancient yet... the &quot;youth of today&quot; is no stupider than I was at that age (they aren't any smarter, tho) but I am aging. The &quot;plastic crap&quot; cliche gets truer and truer with every passing day. On a Barndoor, you could (back in the day) get a rebuild kit for the shock absorbers!!!
