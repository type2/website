&gt;I finally had a chance to dig around and look for my engine code.
&gt;This is what i cam up with, it was right above the engine tin, and right
&gt;below the push rod tubes on the passenger side.
&gt;I believe the engine to be a 914 engine.
&gt;The number i found is 004101102A
&gt;I can't seem to find what it means.

It means you have half a case. That is the casting number, no use to you.
Look for the engine code on top of the engine next to the case seam,
either at the forward end on the left half, or at the rear  down below the
breather portion. There are two letters in front of a series of numbers
which identify the engine size. W,EA,EB are 1700; EC,AN are 1800:
GA , GB are 2000.
