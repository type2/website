&gt;The 009 is worthless with the 34PICT3 carb unless you rework the carb
&gt;completely. The carb is jetted too lean for the advance curve of the
&gt;009. If you run 40 with an 009 and a 34 you won't keep your new engine
&gt;to long unless you have done some serious jetting research; IMHO ;&gt;)

Sheez, is that why mine bogs so? I can either have detonation at speed, or
a non-responsive throttle, whichever I like. ;) The difference is about 1
degree, but it's definitely an either/or adjustment. I knew the 009 wasn't
optimal for the Bus but I thought it had a lot to do with the fact that I'm
running a K&amp;N, so the carb can't suck hot air. Maybe not?

It does run cool, though, I have to really wail it to make the dipstick
warm. Advise me.
