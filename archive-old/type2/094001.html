Subject: Re: [T2] 185/195 Size question

I put vredesteins on my westy  a few weeks back.  LOVE EM...  BTW I put 
the 75 profile on as they were what was available at the time.  Just had 
the speedo checked by a couple of friendly Aurora cops against a 
stationary radar sign and  a gun.  Both with fresh calibration.  I was 
slightly high at 45.(about 46)
tested at 25 35 and 45.  They ticketing speeds in this area.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Looking at 185's vs. 195's on Tires for my 71
&gt;
&gt; 185 and 195 are the widths.  185R14C or 185R14Rf
&gt; is the stock size.  That tire is about 25.7 tall.
&gt;  You will not go wrong with one of the 185R14C.
&gt; I think you were looking at Vredestein's, right?
