&gt;Well the problem is that i
&gt;have to big wires coming out of the alternator. One is the big red one that
&gt;goes to the starter solenoid and the other one is just a hose that has 4
&gt;cables in it. Three of the these cables (red, brown and green) end into a
&gt;black plug with T shape

This plugs into the voltage regulator. It's on the bottom right corner of 
the gas tank panel.

&gt;also there's coming a short blue cable out of the
&gt;black plug that has a transparent plug at the end.

Look at the harness coming out of the corner of the body below the voltage 
regulator. There is a blue wire there.

&gt;There's one black cable
&gt;left that has a transparent plug too, but it's not conected to the black
&gt;plug.

Do you have a Westy?  Or did this alternator harness come from a Westy? That 
black wire comes from stator output on the back of the alternator. It goes 
to the aux. relay to charge the aux. battery.

&gt;Where do i have to conect all of these cables?

&gt;Which one is the cable
&gt;that goes to the control light in the dash?

The blue wire.
That's the blue one.
