Volks,

I am sorry to have to forward this.  Richard was a great contributor back
in the vanagon_at_lenti days.  Please write to John about the fund. I know I
will.

Hi,

I am emailing you folks to inform you that a past list contributor has
passed away from cancer last weekend.
Way back when the Vanagon list was the one place to get VW Bus
listserv-type information, Richard began collecting Bob Hoover's posts
and organizing them so folks could easily access them on the net.
Richard volunteered a lot of his time and programming expertise to help
many folks out with VW questions and information, never expecting
anything in return.  He also hosted the the original Vintage VW Club of
America web site prior to Ernie Otter becoming web master, helping the
VVWCA grow its membership greatly with online membership forms back in
1994(?).   I know that many &quot;old-timers&quot; out there may recall
correspondence with Richard.  The archives reflect his work on the
&quot;Hoover Sermons&quot; and his dedication to his vehicular VW interests.  If
you list administrators care to share this information with your lists,
I would appreciate it.  There is a charity fund that Richard was
involved with that is accepting contributions in his name.  E-mail me
for more information if needed.  He also may have a few Type II's and a
VW Thing at his acreage near Jacksonville, Florida that his widow may be
selling in the future. Again, e-mail me for more information if
needed.   Thanks,

Jon Christensen, former VVWCA Membership Coordinator
