&gt;I have 1974 bus with 1978 2 liter engine equipped with 2 barrel Weber carb.
The following numbers are stamped into carb base: 32.36 DFAV 23A M5.  I am
loking for a manual or instructions on how to properly adjust the carb.  Can
anyone advise on where I can get technical information?  Thanks in advance.

Paul, Weber puts out 2 different manuals..either will do for tuning your 
carb. Should be available at decent sized FLAPS. Run about $12. If you can't 
find one soon, p-mail me and I'll send you the short, simple tune of your 
carb. (Actually should be in archives)
