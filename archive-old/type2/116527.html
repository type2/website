Subject: Blinkers dont blink

	I have a 1971 Bus and my blinkers are not working.  I can turn on the
hazards or the blinker switch and I hear rapid clicking with the occasional
slow click where the blinkers actualy light up on the outside.  Otherwize
its just near solid light on the dash indicator.  Is there a blinker relay
hidden back by the fuse panel somewhere?  Any help much appreciated.
