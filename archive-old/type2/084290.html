Subject: Re: [T2] Vacuum sound

Checked it and I'm getting 14 to 15 inches at idle. Previously got about 12
before I found the leak. Thanks for the reassurance about the hissing sound.

&gt; Yeah the FI type 4 always hisses a little, that air distribution box has
&gt; really thin walls so you will hear the air going through.  Always good to
&gt; verify with a vacuum gauge which can tell you if you still have a leak or
&gt; not.
