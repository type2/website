&gt;Hi All-
&gt;
&gt;    It has finally warmed up enough for me to start working on my bus
&gt;again.  I am currently converted from an auto to a manual tranny.
&gt;    I am trying to get a list of all the sizes and lengths of the
&gt;varoious nuts/bolts throughtout my '74 westy.  I figure that as long as
&gt;I am taking off stuff I might as well replace them with Stainless.

The only way I know of to compile such a list would be to create one from
the microfische or take one apart and make a list. 

For Euro hardware, try &lt;http://www.toolbus_dot_com/index1.htm&gt;. I haven't order
from them yet, but it looks like a focused source.
