Subject: Cool Yard Sale Score and Camp Stove Question (Barely VW)

Okay, the only way this is VW-related is that stuff I got goes on or in the bus.

Scored a mountain bike, a women's 10-speed, a bike rack (the kind that goes
on the rear cargo hatch and lets you get in the engine compartment), two
camp stoves, and a 5 lb. LP tank (with LP in it) for $40 today. Not bad, eh?

Both stoves work fine, but one is a coleman that originally used coleman
fuel and has since been converted to use LP. My question is about the
conversion tube/attachment thing (can be seen on page 169 of the Campmor
Fall '96 catalog). I don't know how much I trust it. This metal tube plugs
into an opening behind the right-side burner, but the tube is then running
through the flame when you're cooking. Has anyone had any experience with
this conversion? Is this how it's supposed to go? I'm worried about heating
the LP in this tube...and what the possible impact of that might be.

Thanks! Joe
