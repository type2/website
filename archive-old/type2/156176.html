Subject: myserious smoke screen

Tha particulars:
  75 bus 2L motor 009 dist weber ICT carbs.
  
  My bus has been sittin' for months (ie 2 months) and before I left I  put some HEET (water asorption chemical) in a full tank of gas. When I  return home, I check the oil (not quite a pint low) start up the beast,  she starts up (after 30 seconds of cranking... but not so bad really)  and we are off.. sounds fine runs great around town. So I take my first  freeway trip; first check the oil again (now she is a pint low so I top  her off.) and head off on the freeway. I plan on stopping ten miles  down the road because I want to makesure my thermostat is opening up  all the way. so ten miles down the road I stop to get gas..Idle at the  stop light and when I hit the gas a huge cloud of (what appears to be  fuel) smoke vomits out the back.. eek! so I check out the car.. running  fine at the idle no smoking at all. I fill the car up, check the  thermostat (open) and head off. Idle at the das station for a minute  and another cloud of gas smoke blinds the people behind me..and
 thats  it.. drive 40 miles waiting for the car to do it again never happens  drive home that night.. nothing.
  
  So my thought is that that was just crap that had settled in the carb  bowls blowing out? Or someting to do with the recent overboring of the  jets on the carb?
  
  Any ideas?
