&gt; shocks, and am happy to report that they held up fine. Next question: Has 
&gt; anybody found a dye that will work on the original curtains in a Westy? Mine 
&gt; are in very good shape, with the exception of exterior fading. Being a world 
&gt; renowned &quot;cheap bast_at_#d&quot; I'd like to re-dye, as opposed to replace. Any 
&gt; suggestions?

turn em over and fade the other side to match!  

just another cheap bast_at_#d
