Subject: Re:Lingering battery/alternator light

Sounds like your battery is shagged! If I understand things 
correctly, the alternator light comes on when there is a voltage 
differential between the alternator and the battery ie either of them 
is at a lower voltage than the other. Sounds like the battery voltage 
is low (slow cranking) and the alternator works (light goes off and 
you can drive long distances) - though I would be concerned about how 
long it takes the light to go out.

Depending on how old the battery is, you should be able to restore 
some life to it by putting it on a battery charger. I'd also consider 
giving the alternator a makeover. I did it to mine the other day 
(changed bearings, cleaned up contacts and slip rings) and have given 
it a new lease on life!

Cheers,

Martin.
