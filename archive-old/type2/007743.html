&gt; Second, most consumer advocate organizations have been reporting that

octane gas.
&gt; They have discounted any other performance gains.  Can anyone verify a
&gt; performance increase from higher octane gas?

This only applies to engines that have knock sensors.  If they detect
knock on low octane gas, the timing is retarded, which reduces
performance.  If you put in high octane gas the timing won't be
retarded so performance improves.

Our buses don't have this feature, so, despite what the oil companies
would like us to believe, increased octane won't improve performance.
