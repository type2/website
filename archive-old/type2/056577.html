when i bought the 77 campmobile, the spare was flat. and i don't know where it
is, but i didn't get no jack with the bus. a couple of days ago, i went to a
gas station to try to air it up. wouldn't hold air. as i'm leaving, i hear
'click-click-click-click-click' !_at_#$% i know what it is. i just picked up a
screw in the front left tire. at the gas station where i'm trying to air up
the spare. great.

i don't touch anything, drive home very slowly. search the list archives until
my brain hurts reading all the different but seemingly inconclusive
information about tires. finally, i settle on the yokohama y356 185r14d.

call discount tire (lots of stores here in dallas). the guy i talk to reaches
the same conclusion...there are only a few choices in the 185r14 size. dunlop
makes one, but it's about $20 more per tire. discount doesn't stock the y356,
and it can take up to 2 weeks to get here, and they want 20% in advance. the
only good part is that they are only $59, and tire rack has them listed for
$55 (not including shipping). so i went today to pay the deposit. they
repaired the screw-damaged tire gratis, and attempted to fix the spare, but it
had a pretty big hole in it and was irreparable. of the 4 tires on there, 1 is
already mismatched, so i decide to go ahead and buy 5 new tires. $436 and
change, after i get suckered into the lifetime replacement scam.

and the guy is telling me about this new process they have called &quot;SIPING&quot; as
in they want to SIPE your tires, $10 per tire. sipe is apparently the name of
the guy who came up with the process. there's a special machine that does it,
and what they do is run your tire through the machine, and it cuts some very
fine diagonal lines through the tread, as deep as the tread. i'm thinking this
sounds like intentionally shredding a tire...but they make some pretty
impressive claims...better traction in rain and snow (because of the 'micro-
treads' you now have on your tires) and tires last 20% longer (because the
micro-treads act like a tiny ventilation system, and keep the tire cooler at
highway speeds), and, of course, &quot;a smoother, quieter ride&quot;. all this
supposedly backed up by some government agency or another. i just can't get
past the idea of shredding my $436 worth of rubber, so i pass on the SIPING.
anybody had their tires SIPEd?

and just so it will show up and confuse somebody else when they search the
archives, i'm going to put in my understanding of the number of plies and load
rating thing.

first of all, the y356 185r14 is a light truck/commercial tire available in
either a C or D load rating. C probably OK for lighter busses, D probably
better for campers and cargo busses, or you guys who actually carry 7 or more
passengers at once. if you want to see a pretty good list of 185r14 tires, go
to tire rack (www.tirerack_dot_com) and search by tire size for 185/0/14.

the y356 is a 6-ply tire. but that's not bad! if these were cross-ply tires,
i.e., not steel-belted, then you would want 8 plies. but with the y356, you
still get the additional plies in the sidewalls, but you don't need as many
down under because they're steel. or at least that is how i understand it. i
hope if this is wrong somebody will let us know, in the interest of keeping
the archives correct!

and i'm going to go ahead and put in a good word about discount tire. i have
bought many sets of tires from these people, and i've never had a bad
experience. they seem to be fast, competent, and courteous, with good prices,
and yes, they even torque your lug nuts instead impact-wrenching them down so
tight that you couldn't possibly get them off on your own.

so does anybody know of any junkyards in dallas (there are so many i don't
know where to start) where it might be possible to find a bus jack?

unfortunately, i'm going to be out of town during the annual vw show that
happens to be closest to me (plano, texas, aug 1). i was hoping to score a lot
of stuff at the swap meet. the list of stuff i need is just too long to even
enumerate. i was also hoping to talk to some people who have already done
their busses, and also learn some stuff. oh well.

so now that i've just dropped the first major piece of change into the bus
since i've had it, i'm beginning to wonder...when i look at everything that
needs to be done, all i see is dollar signs. is bringing it back to factory
spec too expensive a proposition? even if that means a body-off restoration?
i don't think the bus has any major problems, but it seems to have a huge
number of minor ones. to the point where i'm not even sure where to begin. i'd
rather not end up like some of the guys i've read about who end up spending
$10K on their busses.  i'm feeling pretty ignorant right now, and wondering if
i might not be in over my head. should i have just bought one in better shape?

please forgive me for presuming that you would want to read my long
posting...or would you rather have several smaller ones? :)
