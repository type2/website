&gt; I've got some weirdness going on with my CHT gauge that I'd be interested

&gt; To wit, the gauge alternately:
&gt; 	a) reads what appears to be a reasonable temperature
&gt; 	b) flutters between ~170 and ~325, staying mostly on the ~170 side
&gt; 	c) reads low: around 160-200

I'm not completely sure, but doesn't the cht gauge simply read the
changes of resistance between 2 wires? If this is infact true (do
check w/ someone more knowledagable) then could you hook up a vom to
it to at least decide if the gauge is reading what it thinks is
correct or not. if you get nice steady readings on the vom then I
guess the gauge might be suspect.
