Subject: Re: Valve seat out

I had a valve seat fall out and put a ding of similar dimensions in the top of
my piston.  The engine was only 4000 miles old and the heads had been rebuilt
by my local aluminum cylinder head shop.  The only things I replaced were the
heads, rod bearings, and rings.  On the piston I filed the sharp edges off the
ding because I figured these had the potential to get really hot and cause
problems.  I've got 4500 miles on the dinged piston now and have had no
problems.  Now that I think about it, I probably should have taken the rods in
to make sure they were still straight.

&gt; Took head off right side.  #1 valve seat apparently fell out and is now
&gt; lodged at an angle between valve and head.  To make matters worse there is a
&gt; very shiny ding about 3/4&quot; long and 1/16&quot; wide in the piston, made by the
&gt; valve in its current nonstandard position.
&gt;
&gt; Guess I'm buying a new piston, rings, cylinder.  Am I buying an entire set?
