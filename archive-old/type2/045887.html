Subject: Re: [T2] Need source for Raceware head studs?

many people feel that Chromoly studs are not suitable for street use (they
are wrong).
There are two grades of Chromoly studs. The Bugpack ones are the lower
grade, but even they are fine for street use. The better grade of stud are
what you need when you get 300+hp out of these engines.
