Subject: Re: [T2] when does the spark plug fire?

&gt;&gt;On a type4 engine does the spark plug fire on every TDC stroke (every

&gt;&gt;(every 720 degrees of crank rotation)?
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Every 720 degrees, otherwise it wouldn't be a 4 stroke engine.

that's what I thought!!  It just seemed that in other replies to my TDC 
question earlier, people were saying that you could just put #1 at TDC 
and install the distributor drive shaft.  That's just not right because 
it leaves a 50-50 chance that you'll get it installed correctly with 
respect to the cam timing.
