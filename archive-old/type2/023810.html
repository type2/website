Yes indeed!

Where can a person get a receiver hitch for a late (73 on) baywindow anyway?

Thanks in advance!

  This is a bad design for a trailer hitch!!  Don't use this type.  The
  weight of the trailer tongue is held up only by the bumper and the forward
  and back forces press and pull against the engine cross member which then
  pushes/pulls against the front tranny mount.  Terrible engineering.
  
  The best hitch is the one that mounts on both sides of the rear frame
where
  the bumper mounts then has it's own round cross member that is hidden
  behind the bumper.  The bumper does not hold anything and could even fall
  off with no affect to the hitch!!  Also any forward or backward pulling
  forces are directed straight to the frame which is much stronger than the
  early busses.  This hitch does not impare getting to muffler, or changing
  oil.  This is a well thought out design.

  one, thanks.
  
  
  &gt;Here's a .jpg of the pdf I got from hitch-web on the late model bay

  &gt;Uh, I'm not seeing this &quot;vehicle cross member&quot; on my '79 deluxe.
  &gt;
  &gt;Am I blind, or is this wrong?
  &gt;
  &gt;Thanks!
