Subject: Re: [T2] RE: Odd question, How much hp does it really take (a/c
   question)

Hello David,

This is exactly what I was considering doing. I am
going to my local vw junkyard where I know there is a
complete bus a/c settup. There I can look at how the
compressor is connected and if it has a belt
tensioning adjustment. In theroy, I was thinking to
modify the tension system so that when tensioned one
way, the belt to the engine would be tight and when
tensioned the other way, the belt from the electric
motor would be tight much like the belt driven systems
used in riding mowers. Thats just what is bouncing
around in my head. I would really have to study the
compressor mounting system to come up with any kind of
feasible modfication. Any how, thanks for your replies
to my post. I am learning alot. IT is much
appreciated.

Have a great day!

&gt; Russ,
&gt; 
&gt; I'm assuming the original poster was thinking like
&gt; me - in other words, thinking of a way to run the
&gt; A/C with the engine off.  A 110V electric motor of
&gt; sufficient size should be able to drive the
&gt; compressor while parked (at a campground, with
&gt; electricity say) if the mechanical problems could be
&gt; eliminated (like how to easily switch the compressor
&gt; drive over to the electric motor from the engine and
&gt; vice versa).
