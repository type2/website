Subject: oil leak

Anyone have an explanation for oil dripping (streaming) off the engine =
between the #3 &amp; 4 cylinders?  Only happens when the engine is first =
started on cold mornings?  I know the usual suspect is a cracked case by =
the oil cooler but I'm hoping there are other potential (less expensive) =
causes.

Thanks in advance
