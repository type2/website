&gt;
&gt;&gt;   What is different about the intake manifold for a bus?

&gt;71 bus engines are a little strange and have a few one year only parts.
&gt;The generator, gen stand, pulley, front engine tin, intake manifold (end
&gt;castings at least),,,,not sure about the actual manifold, and some other
&gt;little pieces are kind of hard to find.

 How about this ? The 71 bus came with dual ports, but the earlier buses
 came with single port heads, hence the &quot;special &quot; manifold ?
With exception noted for the difference in alternator, requiring the
superceded part #. Depending on the choice or combination of parts,
it is more likely that another dual port set will fit the 71 just fine, be it
&quot;correct&quot; or not.
