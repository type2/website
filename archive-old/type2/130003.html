Subject: Re: [T2] H4 Headlight Question

If you're going to drop money for H4 headlights, do yourself a favor and get a 
set of Hellas.  I've used both the Hella H4's (in my Bus) and the EMPI H4's 
(in wifey's Cabriolet), and the Hellas win hands-down.  I took the EMPI's out
of the Cabby after a few months and put the old sealed-beam-type halogens
back in.  The EMPIs didn't put out as much useable* light.  I've heard that 
Bosch also makes a good H4 but I have no experience with them.

(* note: useable light, not total light.  More total light, but I could see *less* 
at night with those H4s than I could before I installed them.  Yes, they were
aimed correctly)
