Subject: RE: [T2] Only getting 11.6 mpg. Any suggestions?

My best guess would be the overall design of the engine. Separate case and
cylinders vs. a block (WAY different expansion patterns) boxer vs. in-line
or vee, lighter/better balanced reciprocating materials maybe. I couldn't
tell you for sure, but I know someone I can ask.

Quote from my trusty 1979 Type II Owner's Manual, pp. 5:

&quot;You can drive your Volkswagen at full speed from the first day. There is no
break-in schedule.&quot;

And I don't think that's because they broke them in at the factory.
Hopefully they check out the brake systems thoroughly before delivery  &lt;=o

&gt; Then why do new car owner's manuals tell us not to exceed 55 mph the
&gt; first 500 miles?
