Subject: Re: Reliability of Buses 

    Im gonna have to agree with Todd this. Although this has all been
covered to death the issue remains a routine maintenance issue as with any
vehicle. I also dont know if I would call a car thats 9 years old
&quot;relatively new&quot; You must further take into account your bus has 100k more
miles then your Suby, your apt to have a dead batt. at least ONCE. ?
And for MY record
*snip*
&quot; I wonder
if any make and model of vehicles as old as our dear buses are performs
very reliably though. &quot;

Isnt a grammatically correct statement. Weve also covrd the fact that we are
not here to spell check other posts.   :)
Take care all!!
