&gt;  Next question: Has 
&gt;  &gt; anybody found a dye that will work on the original curtains in a Westy? 
&gt; Mine 
&gt;  &gt; are in very good shape, with the exception of exterior fading. Being a 
&gt; world 
&gt;  &gt; renowned &quot;cheap bast_at_#d&quot; I'd like to re-dye, as opposed to replace. Any 
&gt;  &gt; suggestions?

Well, I can't claim to be a &quot;cheap bast_at_#d&quot;, but I do accept the claim of 
being a tight-fisted bi^c#!!!! &lt;grin&gt;

I used rit dye, the darkest green I could find.  Followed the directions to 
the letter, and did them twice in a row.  Turned out **very** nice.

Problem was, the sun had damaged the material by quite a bit, so it started 
to do the same as my pop-top (sun rot) soon after I did the dye job.  Once 
they're gone to this, they're gone.  Good news is they're easy to fabricate 
(with a sewing machine and patience!).
