The trouble is with your master's program, you should ask for a refund!!
They didn't teach you anything about the important things in life, such as
your VW Bus!!

In all seriousness, you should never unhook the voltage regulator from an
alternator, or generator for that matter.

But you didn't mention, do you have fuel injection?  If you do, the power
surge from an unregulated alternator may have fried some of your injection
components.  Sorry.

&gt; Hello all,
&gt; 
&gt; I'm back after a long time off the list.  I graduated with my masters
&gt; and have promptly screwed up my bus.
 
&gt; Does anyone have any ideas??  I'm at a loss... where should I start
&gt; troubleshooting??
&gt; 
&gt; Sorry for the length.  Any advice (outside of comments about my
&gt; stupidity) will be greatly appreciated.
&gt; 
&gt; Jason
