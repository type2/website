Subject: need wing window for my '60

Howzit folks,

My drunken barbaric friend snapped off my passenger
side wing window latch this weekend.  Its toast,
and now I can't keep the creatures out of my bus
at night.  Anyone have an extra?  I'd prefer white,
but it doesn't matter much.

Cheers,
Danny Dayton
'60 camper
