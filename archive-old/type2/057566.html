is some minor disintigration of the outer casing where it meets the
pipes,

This kind of damage is easily repaired.  All you have to do is get
some 16ga strip about 1.5cm wide.  Form the strip into two
half-circles that conforms to the OD of the exhaust pipe.  Slide the
half-circles halfway inside of  the &quot;egged-out&quot; holes in the exchanger
tin so that they form a coller between the pipe and the exchanger tin.
 Braze the strip to the exchanger tin, and you'll never have the
problem again, as the bearing surface of the strip is much larger then
that of the original tin.
