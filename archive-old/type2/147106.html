Subject: Temporary filling of holes in rocker panels???

I will be replacing the rocker panels and dog legs on this bus in the spring
 after Santa brings me the new parts. :-) Has anyone had any experience with
the inner rocker panels that are cut to go around the under supports as
opposed to the piece that is not notched? The notched one looks a lot easier
to use.



Also, I want to seal the panels for the winter so no salt/water gets in to
cause further rust. My thoughts were one of the following:



1) Use undercoating spray on cardboard to create a patch. Let it dry, then
cover the cardboard from the outside with spray on undercoat so it is
waterproof. 



2) Make a plug of expanding foam for a temporary fix, cover with undercoat.



2) Use a single thickness mat and fiberglass for a temporary fix that can be
ground off later.



Would appreciate any comments on this.

Courtney
