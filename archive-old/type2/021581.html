Subject: woo hoo!!!  Buying a new (old) 78 westy!!!

I am going to be the happy owner of a 78 Westy!  I really excited.  I
don't know if you guys remember my initial post a while back looking for
a new bus.. Well, I found one..  I've been chatting back and forth over
the internet with this guy up in Washington and we agreed today on the
terms and I'm going to be flying up in 3 weeks and driving it down.

I've asked a HUGE list of questions, covering nearly EVERY part of the
bus, all the way down to part numbers on the AFM.  I've gotten a good
feel for the attitude of the owner towards his bus and I think it's a
safe bet.  I feel that VW owners in general aren't out to screw anyone,
and if anything, do just the opposite (i.e. airs, bus festivals, etc).
It's a whole different culture; trying to get non-vw owners to
understand that, now that's a challenge :)

So, my friend and I will probably be flying up to Seattle on a thursday
evening and picking up the bus and driving it down over the course of
5-6 days to LA.  I think it'll be a fun drive and I am already planning
to stop in Astoria (I think that's what it's called) to visit the film
site of The Goonies!  I looooooooooooove that film and I need to go
there if it's the last thing I do...

Does anyone else have any recommendations on where to go on the way
back?  I enjoy scenic and tree and water filled routes.. streams and
waterfalls are nice..  I'm thinking of finding that book.. what is it..
where to camp for $5 or less... 

Also, any recommendations on stuff to bring?  I'll be heading up there
with my toolbox in hand, and I think the owner is going to hook me up
with an extra dizzy, accel cable, clutch cable and whatever other
miscellaneous parts he bought extras for :)

ok.. that's 'bout it.. this will be my third bus now.. had a green 76
westy, now an orange 76 westy, and in the next few weeks, a nice forest
green 78 westy!!!!  I will also have 2 spare engines, 2 spare tranny's,
2 extra sets of interiors, a BUCHA hardware, and who knows what else.. 
I figure, it's probably good stuff to keep for a car this old...  

later,
Mike
