Subject: cyl heads loose

	My 1600 DP near end of running-in after rebuild pulled the 
'naval warfare oil-fog' stunt again  -  exactly the same signs as 
when the no. 3 piston burnt thru  -  oil dripping from both valve 
covers onto hot exhausts to generate voluminous white fog which did 
not ignite, and whisps of similar fog emerging from crankcase when 
oil filler cap removed.
	The mechanic who rebuilt this motor reports valve clearances 
all gorn and head bolts were nowhere near proper torque  -  he could 
hear air pumping.  Nevertheless compressions checked all OK.
	The man says he'd tightened the head bolts   -  a mere 25 
ft-lb   -  and has never seen them come loose, in many hundreds of 
rebuilds.  Valve clearances had drifted, some up some down, slightly, 
in early running-in period, not disappeared as at this latest 
breakdown.
  	Heads are std; no head gaskets have been added.  Crankcase is 
Mg, new barrels &amp; pistons std.

	Any suggestions?
