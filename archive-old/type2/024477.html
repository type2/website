Some times these people only have computer forms to fill out, and have to
check whatever box is appropriate. Maybe Vanagon was as close as they could
match. Our old insurance company actually had it on the form as &quot;bus&quot;. We took
exception to that , as it is a Westfalia. Now we have it insured as a &quot;VW
Motorhome&quot;. Think about it. We have had 3 Westfalias over the years, all in
NJ, The tiltles all just said Van. I always thought it should be Van for
something without windows, Station Wagon if it had windows and passenger
seating, and Camper if was, well,..... a camper. Only my
opinion.....................Johnny
