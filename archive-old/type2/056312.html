&gt; I've agreed to buy a '77 Riviera from the soon-to-be PO. My credit

&gt; the paperwork. Most of the used-car books only go back to 1979; same
&gt; with
&gt; the Internet resources I've checked. The CU says they've even called
&gt; other
&gt; financial institutions without any luck.
&gt;
&gt; Does anyone have any suggestions I can pass along to the loan officer?
&gt; The
&gt; bus is in pretty good shape (for a '77) with 103K on the odometer and
&gt; a new
&gt; engine installed last summer.

Brian,
There is a publication on the magazine racks called &quot;Old Cars Rrice
Guide.&quot; Claims to be &quot;the Recognized Standard for Hobbists and
Professoinals.&quot; Prices for the '77 range from $12K for as new to $450
for a wreck. I find their price guidelines to be a little on the high
side, but don't tell your CU that.

Generally, lending institutions and insurance companies will go with the
lowest or an average of three comparibles. Find two (or more) other
vehicles comparable to yours in local or internet ads, Hemmings Motor
News, etc. and present them to your loan officer. Remember, you have the
opportunity to gather as many prices as you can, but you only need to
show them the three highest.

If your credit is good, you will probably be able to get a more
favorable rate on a personal loan than you can get on a used vehicle
loan, so the whole exercise may be moot. Explore other options, like the
4.9% creditd offers that jam the mailboxes, too.
