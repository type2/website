Well, I wouldn't go quite that far.  I basically agree with what Bill said,
and here's why.  

With the flaps in and in the open position, the drivers side flap appears
to direct approximately 25% of the air coming to the left side of the
engine to the oil cooler and the remaining 75% to cylinders 3 and 4.  Now
that I've said that, let me blow it away (no pun intended) by saying that
just because the flap divides the cross-sectional area 25/75 doesn't mean
that that's the percentage of air that will go to the respective areas.  It
depends on whether the air will flow more easily through the cylinders or
the oil cooler, although to a smaller extent than without the flap because
the flap gives you some ram-air effect.

Without the flaps there, 100% of the air will go to both the cooler and the
cylinders.  What this means is that the air will tend to take the path of
least resistance.  So what is the path of least resistance?  I'd say it's
marginally in favor of the cylinders.  That being said, at cruising rpm's
there will be so much air flowing that a good bit will still go through the
cooler.  Maybe more than 25%.  Without the flaps, my only worry would be
overheating the oil at idle (very little airflow, probably almost none
through the oil cooler).

In conclusion, GET GAUGES!  With oil temp and cylinder head temp gauges you
can drive around without the flaps and not worry too much because you will
be able to monitor the temperature of the oil and cylinders and shut the
engine down before it becomes a problem.  You may have to shut it down more
than if you had the flaps though. Or you may not.  I haven't heard from
anyone who has gauges and has actually run both with and without the flaps
- I only have my own experience, and yes I have tried it both ways.  Back
in about 1990 when I was more naive about bus engines, I took out the flaps
for a while.  Believe it or not, the oil seemed to actually run cooler
without the flaps.  Wasn't a huge difference though.

Of course as Bill mentioned you should really get the flaps and a working
thermostat so that your engine will warm up faster.  You need this even if
you live in Las Vegas, since 100 degrees really isn't very warm for an
engine.  That's why I went back to using the flaps.  Well, there was one
more reason I went back to using them - I like the way the flap covers the
oil cooler and makes for a nice smooth approach to the cylinders for the
rest of the air.
