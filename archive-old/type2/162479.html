&gt; What's wrong with this company!!!! :-)


they ignore their current customers,
yesterday a customer of mine who drives a 2000 Eurovan was comparing thire
van with my 78 bus parked next to theirs.  when asked what they were going
to do when that one needed replacing,  their comment was I'm not replacing
it until I can buy another VW van..... wish I could go to Europe and get
one of the diesel vans with sliding doors on both sides and 4 wheel drive!

now money is not a big deal with this person, they paid over 30k for the
bus they have.  said they test drove a d*dge when thiers was in a minor
accident and  it felt like a tin can with no solid feel and handled much
worse..

so VW is even ignoring their current customers, I know this bus is
maintained by the local dealership that would love to sell her another
one.

oh well, just keep my 78 running
