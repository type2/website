Subject: Dumb Guy needs help

While doing an oil change this weekend on my 70 westy, I somehow stripped one
of those 6 studs that hold that plate that covers the oil screen. Does that
make sense? Anyways, how easy is it to replace that stud?? Obviously I don't
know much, but I like dinking around under there and learning so I would
appreciate any help.
Thanks
Zach
