Subject: [T2] Transmission bracket, '75 Weekender

I may have asked this before, but with finals and papers due for summer 
semester my mind has fragmented into a thousand pieces.

The bracket above the transmission that has the 2 bolts going into it is 
bent.  It must have happened this last time that I put the motor back in.  
Unfortunately, I have replaced and repacked all of the cv joints, and bolted 
everything in place.  Do I need to remove the cv joints and pull the entire 
motor again, or can I just unhook the motor and drop it down a couple of 
inches with the cv joints still attached?  The bracket looks like it will be 
easy to remove and straighten, I just need to move the transmission down far 
enough to get a socket in there and pull the bracket out.  Oh magic 8 ball, 
please tell me that this can be done...

Thanks in advance,

Tracy Hill
