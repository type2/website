&gt; hello all,

Sorry i didnt get backl sooner, i've been rather swamped. and the savannah
pop for earthlink .sucks...But i digress.

&gt; i have a 75' camper westy, i was wondering if it is possible to remove
&gt; the poptop (only orig. roof showing) and install a sunroof off of a
&gt; doner bus or install some sort of ragtop (i think the sunroof and ragtop
&gt; are two different setups?) in the hole in the roof. anyone know how to

Short answer: No.  68-72 westies ued the same roof as a sunroof bus,
including the sunroof housing.  you could theoreticly install a complete
unit into this housing after removing the poptop and filling all the holes
left from it..


74+ buses are different.  The roof is now just a superstructure to support
the poptop and the double bed.  If you remove the top, luggage rack, and
the 3 bed boards, you will have a flat hole from just behind the front
seats, to just in front of the rear drip edge. (with a single cross member
towards the rear..)

you .could. conceivably fabricate a sliding ragtop (ala 21/3 window
deluxes) to cover this area.  Its possible that the company who is now
making the sliders for bugs, buses, t3s, etc could custom fabricate
this....this would probably entail transporting your bus to the Pheonix AZ
area (i think that is where they are located...as far as we were able to
tell, they are the only company remaining who makes this style roof.
Webasto DOES have a 36x36 fullpower rag called the Big Sky..)

Once completeed, you would likely be several thousand dollars poorer.
then you would still need to fill the holes left from the luggage rack...


One other option.  Check with upolstery shops, ones who do convertable
tops and vinyl tops.  They may be able to build a light framework to go
over this hole, and wrap it in vinyl....and either have it either
perminatley affixed, or removable (as a unit).  Still would be pricey for
this one-off fabrication.

anything is possible, if you have th emoney to do it.

good luck.
