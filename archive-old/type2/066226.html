Subject: Re: Repairing Windshield Wiper Motor

Re repairing the wiper motor plastic gear to shaft connection.  This
happened to me like 4 years ago, and my fix lasted until last week- have
been carrying a spare motor; went to put it in, CONNECTOR not compatible,
so I took out the gear in spare and stuck it into the old one.  What irks
me is why VW used a PLASTIC gear with a metal shaft that's roughened and
slipped into a sleeve/hole in the plastic gear that can crack and let the
shaft SLIP in the hole (can easily happen if yo try to run wipers frozen on
by ice).   MY FIX:  Drill the center out of a washer (for 1/4&quot; bolt) so it
fits SNUGLY over the collar of the shaft hole. EPOXY the shaft into the
hole with the washer in place to hold any cracks tight, keeping collar
tight around the shaft.  Use the long setting epoxy, not the 5 minute
stuff!  Make sure you adjust the little setscrew that controls play in the
shaft so there is just a LITTLE play.
