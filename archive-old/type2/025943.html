If you take the PCH then you won't have to worry about speed, you will be
more concerned about tacking into the wind with all your might to keep
Speedy from blowing into the other lane of traffic.

I would say if the bus is cooling right you should be fine.  if its not
there are some fine overlooks to relax on while you wait for a tow truck or
hopefully that AIRS member.

I estimate your time of arrival if all runs fine at around 6.5 hours.  You
should not have to stop at all other than to look over the ocean bluff or
watch some surfers or something.

drive easy,

charlie
