Subject: RE: [T2] stud size

-----Original Message-----From: Greg Potts
Subject: Re: [T2] stud size

&gt; The exhaust studs on a type4 engine are 9mm at the engine end and 8mm at
&gt;the heater box.

ORIGANNALY; they were 8mm on both ends the 9mmX8mm studs are/were designed
for &quot;striped out&quot; holes...

&gt;They're not cheap... last set I bought cost $9CDN each!

So that's like what $1.63 American????
