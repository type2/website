&gt; I'm rebuilding a 1776  for my '71 Westy.  Last year, when I first
did a
&gt; rebuild on this engine, I installed Berg heads and Berg swivel foot
&gt; adjusters on the rocker arms.  Last week, with the engine on the test
&gt; stand, I was adjusting the last of the eight valves when the adjuster
&gt; sheared in  half as I was tightening the nut.
&gt; 
&gt; I had a list  of parts  to order from RMMW so I added swivel foot
adjusters
&gt; to that list.  They arrived today.
&gt; 
&gt; The design of the RMMW adjusters is fundamentally different from
that of
&gt; the Berg version.  The Berg has the &quot;elephant's foot&quot; design;  the
RMMW is
&gt; a small swiveling foot embedded in a housing.
&gt; 
&gt; I have a decision.  Replace all eight with the new RMMW ones or place
&gt; another order with Berg and wait another week.
&gt; 
&gt; Is anyone acquainted with the two types?  Is there any experience
out there
&gt; which favors one over the other?

If you mean the ones that have a ball with a flat on its face, you
really don't want to use them.  They are a bear to adjust, as the flat
is always getting cocked sideways, preventing the feeler from moving
into its proper place even if the feeler is thin enough to pass the
gap. I ended up having to loosen several adjusters each time to adjust
the valves.  Not a good situation at all.

Even the Berg adjusters can be a problem, as they alter the valve
geometry.  The spacers and odd angles introduced into the system can
cause unusual wear patterns in the parts.

My personal preference is to stick with the stock adjusters and
replace them once in a while if they get flattened.  Unless you are
running a rapidly-opening cam or extra-heavy valve springs you don't
need this type of adjuster.  After my experience I went back to stock
and have been happy ever since.
