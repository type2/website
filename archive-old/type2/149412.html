Subject: '72 gas cap key

The gas cap key I got from my HARDWARE store has, on one sde

   FUEL

and on the other side

     ilco 1098GX B52

If you call around to your local TruValue ACE old fashioned styled hardware 
store, you can ask if they have this key blank.  Then stop by with your gas 
key and gas cap and check if this is the right one for you.
