Well, after several hours of crawling around with a VOM I have come to the
conclusion that the pressure switches must be bad. Two reasons: 1) When
testing the swithes for operational continuity, one of them has none wither
the brakes either on or off; one has connection with the brakes off but
nothing with the brakes on; and B) Testing the wires reveals voltage flowing
to the switches and jumping the wires on either plug makes the lights go on.

The only other question is: With one switch totally non-functional and the
other only half-functional, shouldn't that make the warning light come on?
Right now it only comes on when I turn the ignition switch, then goes off
when the engine starts. Or does the logic of the warning light work
independently of the electrical function of the switches? Or should I care?

TIA again,
Dave
