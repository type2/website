That's probably enough pressure to rip a CV boot right off'un there.
Probably blow the grease out of a Cat D-9 link pin. Very dangerous
procedure. Keep an ear out for your bearings starting to rumble what with
the grit and water/steam forced into the rear hubs. More than garden hose
sprayer force is a bad idea for lots of places on a vehicle. Even that is
too much directed at shaft seals unless a soft low pressure spray is
employed.

&gt;&gt; It wasn't the type that you get from the rental store; this was a big
&gt;&gt; momma, trailer mounted with about 20 HP and a Diesel fueled water heater
&gt;&gt; that would crank out 3000PSI at 210 Degrees.
&gt;&gt; I cleaned out my CV pockets in the swing arms, all of my fender wells,
&gt;&gt; all of my front suspension and that always greasy rear area above the
&gt;&gt; muffler (where I dribble oil while adding 8oz.).
&gt;
&gt;Now you can think about all the water that you forced into places that
&gt;water really isn't supposed to go.  3000PSI goes past rubber seals with no
&gt;problem at all, but how does the water (and soap?) get back out?
