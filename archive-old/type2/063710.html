&gt; I have heard that the ground effects can be broken by hitting a bump, catching
&gt; some air, and then the lift takes over.  However, since this &quot;wing&quot; is so
&gt; short from side to side and has no stability, the now-flying bug tips over
&gt; (probably to the left because of the weight of the driver), and depending on
&gt; how high it has flown, lands on its side or roof.....

I've often thought of this...that is...making a flying bug.  One would 
have to add a tail assembly and add some wings but I think with a little 
ingenuity, a flying bug with a pusher prop would be a distinct 
probability.  The major problem I could forsee is that you'd have to use 
a POWERFUL engine to get the thing into the air.  A stock VW engine 
couldn't do it I don't believe.  Just a few thoughts though....
