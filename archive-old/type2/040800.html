No, I made patches from sheet metal and brazed them over the holes.  I
also made sheet-metal sleeves to close up the egged-out holes where the
exhaust pipe enters the can.  This is a permanant fix and has lasted for
years on our two VWs.

The &quot;muffler bandage&quot; kits might work for a temporary fix, but I'd be wary
of the fumes they
might introduce to the heating system.  Better to bite the bullet and get
out the torch.
