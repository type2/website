Subject: RE: [T2] door latch

What's broken, the lock or the latch? You can often fix them by removing the
things, cleaning, greasing, and maybe replacing the spring (find one that
looks similar). Cleaning and greasing did wonders for my locking action.

Does anyone know where I can get a new/used drivers side door latch
mechanism
for my 72 Bus?   Mine has apparently broken, and I drive it daily and need
to
be able to lock up.
