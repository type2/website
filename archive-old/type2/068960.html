Subject: Type2 List Charter

This file is posted to the list every Thursday.

Type2 is about being in busses on the road, keeping busses on the road, and
getting neglected or forlorn busses back on the road, because that is where
they should be. The noblest thing you can do here is to help a fellow
listee get a broken bus rolling. There are other considerations, but all of
them are secondary.

Subscription instuctions follow, but before subscribing please do note that
this is a high-volume list. A typical day might see traffic on the order of
100K bytes. If you aren't prepared to deal with this kind of mail volume,
an alternative is to read the list when you have time from the Hypermail
archive on Skip Montanaro's web page:

http://www.automatrix_dot_com/~skip/volkswagen

If you wish to subscribe, note that there is a real-time option and a
digest option. In digest, the server saves list mesages until they reach a
threshold of about 32K, then sends you one large message containing many
smaller ones. The digest is strongly suggested if you:

1. Get your email through AOL, Compuserve, NetCruiser or Prodigy, which
have suffocating restrictions on mailbox volume.

2. Are new to the Internet and aren't used to dealing with colossal amounts
of data--it's a learned skill.

3. Are subscribing from work and your boss might geek over the disk space
and the distraction.

Okay, then, let's do it:

 ------------------------------------------------------------------------

To subscribe to the type2 list in real time, send this message:

   subscribe type2

to this address:

   majordomo_at_primenet_dot_com

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------

To subscribe to the list in digest mode, send this message:

   subscribe type2-digest

to this address:

   majordomo_at_primenet_dot_com

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------

To post to the list, send your public message to this address:

   type2_at_primenet_dot_com

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------

To switch from real-time to digest, send this message:

   unsubscribe type2
   subscribe type2-digest

to this address:

   majordomo_at_primenet_dot_com

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------

To unsubscribe from the list, send this message:

    unsubscribe type2
    unsubscribe type2-digest

to this address:

Here's the drill: VW content is obligatory.  FS and WTB ads are allowed.
Trip reports are allowed even if they ramble. Show announcements are
allowed. Posts by vendors are allowed unless they are outright spam. If
your message concerns watercooled busses as well as aircooled ones, you can
cross-post to the Vanagon list--the two lists maintain a symbiotic
relationship. All rules will be routinely bent. ;)

This list has a very friendly, loose style and messages tend to be laced
with humor. We have a helluva lot of fun here and we hope you will, too.
But please DO NOT conclude from this that the list is a chat session--it
isn't. When you post a message, that message is sent to hundreds of people
all over the world and it's rude to waste their time.

If you post frivolous or off-topic messages, I'll probably speak to you by
pmail and I may intercept your messages and look them over before they're
posted. If you continue, you'll find your subscription cancelled.

The preferred way to reply to a list message is by private email. Unless
your reply is of genuine list-wide importance, don't post it to the public
list. This is a question of substance, it's a judgement call, and it
belongs to you. Please consider carefully whether everybody on the list
might be profited by your reply. If you're answering a mechanical question,
it's probably good to post it publicly. If you're adding your two cents to
a thread that's not too important to begin with, or making a wisecrack, do
it by pmail.

Quote only for context. Do not quote entire messages and add a reply, this
is annoying. If you quote somebdy else's message including his signature in
order to add a wisecrack to the bottom, you're going to be hearing from me.

Be specific in your subject line. We want to know your problem and your
year of manufacture--put them in the header. A fuel-injected 82 is a lot
different from a barndoor.

Friday. The concept of list-wide TGIF originated (to my knowledge) on the
Vanagon list, which is our sister list, and since it makes sense we filched
it. ;) Friday is intended to be a release valve and morale-builder; things
are looser on that day. As of November, 1996, because of increasingly heavy
mail load, several topics that are arguably bus-related but are fairly
trivial were moved to Friday-only status.

It is imperative that you understand that Friday ends at midnight on that
day, it does not endure indefinitely. Come Saturday, we have to stop even
if we don't really want to. Do not post messages on these topics on any
other day.

Topics that are appropriate only on Friday include:

TOYS AND MEMORABILIA - Many listees collect toy busses and some are
interested in old VW advertisements and owner's manuals and dealer
literature and such.

VW ESOTERICA - Accounts of peculiar or amazing feats involving VWs. There
seems to be no end to these stories. This category includes accounts of the
origins of the bus, which come up every few months.

SURVEYS - Perennial favorites among some and irritating nuisances to
others, these are the &quot;what if?&quot; fantasy threads. &quot;What bus would you like
to be stranded with on a desert island?&quot;

SIGHTINGS - Spotting a bus in some medium and reporting it to the list.
This usually involves noting a bus in a television show or commercial and
becoming very excited. Frankly I think some of you need to get out more.

BUSWEAR - Please confine discussion of Mr. Palmer's popular line of bus
fashions and accessories to Friday.

HUMOR - Can vary widely, you'll know it when you see it. Has included some
sublime stuff including song lyrics and epic poetry. Humor MUST HAVE BUS
CONTENT, if it doesn't then don't post it no matter how funny it is. Please
do not drag over generic automotive humor that circulates among automotive
lists and newsgroups, and please do not crudely splice feeble bus content
into generic automotive humor articles--this never fools anybody.

People on the list often put together gatherings. It is appropriate to post
an announcement if you are planning an event; after that you need to put
together your own small mailing list. Do not do trip planning on the list.

With regard to the CCC list: Martha &lt;busgirl_at_netcom_dot_com&gt; maintains a list
of people she knows to be interested in California Camping Crazies events.
Because of the way this list is handled, messages to it tend to try to post
themselves to the type2 and v_at_l lists unless people are very careful with
their headers, and often they aren't.

Please edit type2 out of your header when posting messages to the CCC list.
Trip planning can get very trivial and dull if you are one of the 900+
people who aren't going to be able to be there, and you can't expect those
people to be interested in things like menu planning and pleas for
sufficient toilet paper.

Post-event trip reports are welcome anytime.

Discussion of Beetles, Ghias, 41Xs, and such is not topical. There are
other lists for all of these.

If mail from the list to you starts bouncing, I may unsubcribe you without
telling you. If the list mysteriously stops coming, this is probably what
happened.

Please do not post automated server commands to the list.
Please do not post &quot;test&quot; messages to the list.
Please do not post messages with attachments to the list.
Please do not post messages in any other character set than US-ASCII.

Folks who are having trouble can send mail to my human address, which is

bighouse_at_socomm_dot_net

and we'll fix it up one way or another.
