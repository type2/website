&gt;
&gt;There's gotta be a better way to keep these wheels on the busses. 
&gt;I've heard story after story of wheels coming off VW's and had one do 
&gt;the same to me.
&gt;
&gt;Is it the fact that they use lug bolts instead of studs and lugnuts? 
&gt;What are some recomendations for keeping the wheels on ....other than 
&gt;&quot;torque to the specs as per the bentley&quot;. We all know that. Sometimes 
&gt;doesn't seem to work though. 4000 miles isn't that much.
&gt;
&gt;I've never had another brand vehicle even have the lugnuts loosen up 
&gt;at all. Must be a flaw in the design of lug bolts. Why did they do it 
&gt;that way?
