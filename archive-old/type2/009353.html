Hi all,
     As you no doubt already know, things got kind of exiciting 
yesterday. We had a little rattle that kept getting worse as we went on. 
Interesting thing is, it only happens when the engine is maintaining 
speed on a flat. Going uphill with load on the engine, or going downhill 
and either coasting or torqueing on the engine it doesn't knock. 
Originally I thought it might be a CV joint, but on closer inspection I 
discovered the flange on the left side of the tranny(where the CV bolts 
on) had about a quarter inch of play vertically. Shouldn't have any. This 
of course made the likely suspect the bearing. Since it got continuously 
worse as we went along, we got pretty worried about it, and sent out the 
request for friendly driveways.  Along with many others, listee Rex 
Rodgers in San Angelo replied with a most generous offer of assistance. 
We did a little futzing about with maps, and discovered that going down 
to Roswell, then over to Texas and down 87 to 71 was only 10 miles longer 
than going through Clovis to Lubbock, etc. So, since we had a friendly 
offer, we decided to go for it. We also decided to make it an all-nighter.

     So, we shot on out from Albuqureque to 285, then down to Roswell. 
Hit Roswell about 5 in the morning, so all the UFO tourist shops were 
closed. Oh well... ;-) Took off from Roswell with a strong headwind, 
which kept torque on that bearing, and it just sort of relaxed and let us 
drive. What a relief. Taking all the state roads, besides being shorter, 
was quite relaxing. Rather than the hustle and bustle of the interstate, 
we had the laid back farmland of northwestern Texas. Just past Big 
Spring, heading toward San Angelo, the terrain becomes more like the hill 
country, pretty stuff.

     All in all, apart from a long drive, it was an uneventful return. 
Somewhat stressful on Tuesday night, but all's well that ends well. Once 
again, I am amazed by the competence of the German engineers. We had a 
obviously unserviceable bearing on the tranny, yet it survived nearly 900 
miles. Amazing.

     Along with the knocking tranny, our inverter took a dive as well, so 
we had no juice in the book for pictures, sorry 'bout that... ;-) Craig 
did do up a nice animated gif, take a look at this report on the web 
pages for that... ;-) 

     So that's it. We're home. I'ml going to go play with Hunter now. 
Thanks for listening...


Peace,
