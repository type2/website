Subject: propane powered type2's - any further info on this?

Dave and list, I had mentioned earlier that I was looking at a 78 westy that
was converted to propane, and was wondering of the availablility of propane
in the US. I did look at the conversion, and it appeared to have a
carburetor/propane conversion from what I could decipher of it. Perhaps it
was a throttle body propane conversion. Does anyone know the possibilities
of converting to propane with fuel injection or perhaps a dual-fuel
conversion as used on the early Lada's that were imported into Canada?
Thanks,
Courtney
