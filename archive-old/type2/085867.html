Subject: Seattle Bay Owners: Help with Bay Kick and Door Panels

Does anyone in the Seattle area have a door panel and/or kick panels=20
from a 71-79 bus that I could quickly borrow to make a pattern? If=20
you have one out of the bus just lying around that would be great,=20
but otherwise I don't want you to have to go to the trouble.

Feel free to email me at hal_at_sitespecific_dot_net or give me a call at=20
206-355-2074. I will come to you.

Thanks,
Hal Landvoigt
