&gt; I replaced recently the generator of our bay-window bus (1969) with an
&gt; alternator I got from the previous owner.
&gt; I now wonder about the correct hook-up of the wires. I have this thick red
&gt; wire connected to B+, the green wire connected to DF... is this OK? I
&gt; suppose the brown wire is ground, should I connect it to D-? And leave D+
&gt; alone?
&gt; 
&gt; I wanted to be sure before starting the engine...

Hello Bart  That is correct  have you removed the voltage regulator?  you 
will need to connect all 3 big wires together and the 2 smaller wires together . 
Your alt should have a internal regulator   later  Mark Dearing
