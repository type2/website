Subject: Re: [T2] Welding fabrication???

Eron,
There's a guy here in Australia who specialises in
transplanting V6's &amp; V8's into Baywindows.
His name is Kimm Garland &amp; he run a company called
Indian Automotive that does all sorts of bus work,
everything from general services to split-window
restorations to Baywindow hot rodding.
You can check them out at http://kruizinwagon_dot_com.au 
Kimm should be able to give you lots of hints.
He runs a GM supercharged &amp; EFI 3.8 litre V6 in his
severly slammed 71 Dual Cab &amp; it's a weapon!
Best of luck.
:-)
Cheers

&gt; 	Hello listees,
&gt; I am currently looking into transplanting a VR6
&gt; watercooled powerplant into 
&gt; my '70 Deluxe.  Aside from the obvious modifications
&gt; necessary(which I feel 
&gt; confident I can tackle alone), there is the single
&gt; issue of rear(which would 
&gt; be side form the original vehicle) motor mounting. 
&gt; Is there anyone in the 
&gt; Boise,Idaho/SE Oregon area who knows of, or can
&gt; themselves handle the 
&gt; fabrication necessary to create a custom mounting
&gt; mechanism for such a 
&gt; transplant?  The last time I looked into this, I was
&gt; given websites with 
&gt; information on a Vanagon-VR6 transplant, and a Chevy
&gt; Vortec V-6 into a Bus, 
&gt; but these projects were different enough that I
&gt; couldn't use either as a 
&gt; reference.  Any help would be appreciated.  If
&gt; anyone knows of anyone else 
&gt; who has tackled this also, perhaps they could point
&gt; me in their direction as 
&gt; well?  Thank you all(in advance).
&gt; 
&gt; 	Eron Crites
