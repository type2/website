Subject: Wide-5 wheels needed around DC

OK, this message has limited bus-content - i.e. I could use wide 5 bus
wheels as well ...

I need to tow a '49 bug to NYC. Since it has the stock 16&quot; wheels with
5.00-16 tires, getting tires or just inner tubes is next to impossible
(Coker only has 5.25-16 - too big for 3&quot; rims and German inspection
requirements). But two wheels do not hold air (and the good ones are 40
years old). So I need two wide-5 wheels with tires that hold air and are
likely to survive a 200 mile haul on a tow dolly.

Does anyone around DC have bug, splittie, or early bay leftovers and willing
to sell them? I will not be able to return these as the bug will be shipped
to Germany in rolling condition.

Thanks,
Marcus
