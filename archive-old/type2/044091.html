Subject: [T2] Z-Bed in a Double Cab

Has anyone tried this? I just measured the Z bed and it looks like enough
room. My backseat isn't original so if the Z-bed works I'll be able to sleep
in the back on long trips. Does any one have the correct back seat for a 68
Double Cab they would like to sell for a fair price?
