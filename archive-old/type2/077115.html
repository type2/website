Subject: Re: [T2] NC Appraiser needed

&gt;&gt;I am fighting the insurance company and they are giving me a low ball
offer
that i refuse to take.&lt;&lt;

find body shops in your area to give you estimates.  give the estimates to
the insurance company.  if they refuse to give you a reasonable amount to
get your bus repaired, threaten to sue them.  they will likely pay up.  i
think they are required to give you a reasonable amount.  those estimates
are your best weapon.

good luck,
