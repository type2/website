Subject: VW Heritage SS muffler
Message-ID: &lt;Pine.BSF.4.05.10103270654110.9889-100000_at_lenti.type2_dot_com&gt;
X-Diagnostic: MESSAGE REQUIRES APPROVAL - A

I got an email back from them.
They confirmed that the SS muffler fits all 1500/1600 busses.
I added their shipping estimate and price. Converted to USD it is 147.00.
Not bad. Im still waiting a bit to see if someone tries to become a
reseller which I think should get the price down some.
