Subject: everybus bummer man

Hi,

My wife and I would REALLY like to do family oriented bus stuff this year 
and the dates of April 4 to 6 are just one week shy of the end of her 
exams. I am just saying that, not really whining. OK, yes, I am whining.

Can anyone think of something closer to PEI, Canada that we can fit in 
between the dates of 15 April and the 12th of May.

Even if I have to drive early and fly her down, it would be worth it to us 
to attend something like Everybus.

As soon as it is nice enough out, I am tidying up our bus mechanically and 
physically for camping and driving.

Alan
