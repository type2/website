&gt; &gt;One thing no one has touched on lately is how our busses really like

I have a 78 with the 2L engine but still tend to hold it down, one thing,
around here only a couple interstates even have a speed limit over 55, and
their usually so busy and patroled by cops that it's smart to keep your
speed down anyway.
