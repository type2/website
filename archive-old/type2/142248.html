Subject: RE: [T2] I Smell Gas...  (old story, new thread)

I have a 73 and the tube is up there, although hard to find since you can't
see it. Not sure about a 78. Mine was rotted very bad. You should be able to
feel the ends of the metal tubes if the rubber piece is missing. If you have
the metal tubes that go up and down the vent in the back of the bus and then
into the charcoal canister, then you should have the rubber tube behind the
spare tire.

The metals tubes are connected to the top of the gas tank and provide a way
for fuel vapors to exit the gas tank and into the charcoal filter and onto the
carb/fi to be reburned. I also took the firewall out and replaced the rubber
tubes on top of the gas tank. They were not to bad, but I was taking no
chances.

I over filled my bus once when I first got it and fuel came out the rotten
tube and spilled all over the aux. battery. Not good.
