&lt;Subject: Wiring diagramm fuer BN2 heater eberspaecher
for my aircooled vanagon  80 i need the wiring diagram for the gas heater  
BN2 build by Eberspächer.&gt;

I have the diagrams for most of the eberspacher heaters.. including the BN-2
However, the BN-2 is the heater most often found in beetles.
The original system in a 1980 Vanagon should be a BA-6
So..is it the little gray, round unit with the red fan in the end (BN-2)
or the big, hulking monster installed under the floor (BA-6)?
you may all know this but, For the record :
B= Bezine (gasoline)
D= Diesel
N= self contained, independent heater
A= heat &quot;booster&quot; that works with the cars duct work etc.
2,4,6= number of Kilocalories per hour produced by the heater alone

So..the type 181 has a BN-4 as does the bus with the heater in the engine
compartment
Bugs etc? BN-2 in the trunk(no temperature regulation on these,BTW..off or
HOT!)
the 411-412 has a BA-4 above the transaxle,
the later buses with the heater between the frame rails? BA-6
and the lowly diesel Vanagon...DA-6....
Simple, non?
I would post all the info I have on these and the SW Southwinds..but my
scanner is garbage....I can fax to those in need..or someone can jump up and
offer to scan and post all the best stuff...any takers?
steve.....
