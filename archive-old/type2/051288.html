Subject: Re: [T2] Engine repair costs?

jakomisa sends:

&gt; Bus one is a '73 manual...  To quote the current owner: &quot;the engine needs
&gt; rebuilt  because one of the rods broke. there is a hole on the top and back
&gt; side of the block.  but i put lots of new parts on the engine before this
&gt; happened, so there is much that is still usable.  the bus ran well/good before
&gt; that incident.&quot;  How much would that cost to repair?  Is the engine
&gt; salvageable at all, or would I need a new one?  How much would it cost to be
&gt; rebuilt?

Basically, you need a new longblock...maybe, just maybe, you can salvage the
heads, pushrods and pushrod tubes off this one. I've seen these in the VW
magazines for around $800 and you'll have to eat the core charge--$500? Your
saving grace is that if the engine was running before the rod broke, you'll
get a usable intake system and usable exhaust system, and that stuf ain't
cheap.
