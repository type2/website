Subject: Window Lifter  Regulator Replacement

Hi Volks,

I tried to remove the driver's side window lifter or
regulator today but couldn't remove the old one.
I have a 72 VW Bus.  It seems the wing window chrome
frame is in the way.  I removed ALL the screws and had
the old regulator ratting around loose inside the
door. Just couldn't get it past the wing window fram
which juts down into the door interior.  Is there any
tricks anyone has for how to remove the regulator with
out removing the wing window???
