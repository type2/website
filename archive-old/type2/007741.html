&gt;I have been working on my bug &amp; bus fixing exhaust problems and the tools are
&gt;all covered in oily muck. Now while I know oil will protect them, since they
&gt;live inside the house I don't want the smell and more importantly, oily 
&gt;handles
&gt;are dangerous. Washing in water makes things rusty so how does everyone else
&gt;clean &amp; care for their tools ?
&gt;

     My tools live in the bus (no garage), so I usually just wipe 'em 
down with a towel or rag. The slight oil residue left over keeps 'em from 
rusting. Since they live in the bus I don't care much about the smell. 
Depending on the bus you have, and the reasons for not leaving 'em in the 
bus, this here ideaer may be good for 'ya. 

     I've long thought of getting one of those steel toolboxes that Real 
Men put in their pickups (along with a big dog and a few empty beer 
cans), and then bolting it to the floor inside the bus. Either in the 
passenger compartment, or behind the backseat, whichever works best. This 
allows both for tool storage, and some semblance of saftey when parking 
in lousy neighborhoods, plus allows having a full tool set available at 
all times. Anyone who knows me knows I'm a little paranoid on this part-I 
hate having the tool I need, but not having it with me when I need it. I 
do carry this to extremes though-I carried a 2nd longblock all the way to 
Inuvik, 'cuase I was paranoid about the engine crapping out in Timbuktoo, 
NorthWest Territories, where VW parts are an inside joke amongst FLAPS 
workers... &quot;He wants, get this, a *VW* alternator!!! &lt;ROTFL&gt;&quot;


Peace,
