The bolt snapped off my solenoid along with a portion of the solenoid
itself. I have read in the archive that it is possible to replace just the
solenoid. Does anyone know of where I might purchase one? If I go to the
junkyard what years are compatable with a 77 manual transmission bus?
Thanks!
Eric
