Subject:  Engine dies  :(

Update:

I have fire at the spark plugs so I believed it was a fuel problem.

 I couldn't for the life of me get my head above the carb throat to check
for a gas spray so I just pulled the carb off the manifold. With a long
length of fuel line attached to it and sitting on a table behind the bus and
gas shooting into it I pulled the accelerator and only a little gas comes
out of the bottom of the carb. A little spray and dribble. I guess the carb
is clogged, which would make sense since it would run for a couple seconds
only.

So now that the single weber is off  where exactly can I look to unclog
things? I have never done this before, but I am very ready!!! I need to do
it today/tonight to drive the bus to the campout this weekend. I looked in
the archives under single weber rebuild, but came up short. Is there a link
on the web for this?

Thanks for all the response!!

&gt; Rob,
&gt;
&gt; The cam gear does more than power the mechanical pump.  It lifts and
&gt; lowers your valves and rotates the rotor on the distributor. If the cam
&gt; gear has loosened on the cam shaft, then the valves are opening and
&gt; closing at the wrong time and the dist is firing at the wrong time.  I
&gt; have seen a cam shaft with the holes in the gear egged out 1/2&quot; and the
&gt; gear free to rotate 10 degrees, but have never had it happen to me.  the
&gt; only way I can think of to test for this is to do the static time
&gt; procedure turning the engine clockwise, then do it turning the engine
&gt; counterclockwise.  If the results are significantly different, then you
&gt; have a big problem.
