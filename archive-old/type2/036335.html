&gt; Hi guys and galls,
&gt; 
&gt; What is &quot;autostick&quot; - Like a gear shift without a clutch?????

I don't believe it was ever avaliable for the bus, but in the type I it
was a servo controled clutch that operated whenever one touched the
gearshift lever (not for those who liked to have a hand on the shifter)

those that like it love it, those that don't despise it.
