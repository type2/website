&gt; The Big Question: What makes a distributor correct for a certain year?

&gt; distributor???

To this day I don't think anyone has put together a better reference 
than Jim Thompson did, it is referenced in the type2_dot_com Library and it 
lives on here (also I hope someone is backing up a copy of it, all we do 
is link to it):
