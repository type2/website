&gt; btw, for those of you that are going the MegaSquirt route, you can also
&gt; do all of this (and more) w/ the MS' ignition control.  Eventually I

&gt; the MS.  I just haven't gotten around to doing it yet...

BTW, is there any word on the SuperMegaSquirt with designed-in spark
control?  I know that spark control can be added to the older MegaSquirt,
but I'd really prefer to start with a design that was intended for spark
as well as fuel.
