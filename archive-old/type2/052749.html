Subject: [T2] Re: Turnkey, Fuel Injected, New Mexican VW engines...

Hi Ronnie;

Thanks for all the information.

I can't find the name of the List member in the UK who bought the Brazilian
Type 2 bus a couple of years ago.  But I'm sure he said it was the latest
1600 FI engine with all the upgrades, and that he reported it had much more
power and performance than other buses with 1600 engines.

As I recall he had it converted to a camper in England after taking delivery
and driving it for a while.

Is it possible the version of the 1600 FI engine that VW Brazil installs in
buses has been re-tuned,
re-calibrated, or otherwise modified to adapt it to the needs of a loaded
Type 2?

The Mexican VW 1600 FI engines have the spin-on oil filter attached to the
oil pump, so it's in the way of the rear engine support bar used on a
baywindow bus.  So did VW Brazil use a different oil filter arrangement, or
a special rear support bar, or something else completely different to get
the 1600 FI engine installed in their buses?

Somewhere out there the information we need is accessible/available.  If I'd
known then what I know now, all those decades ago in High School I would
have taken Portugese for my foreign language requirement :-)

&gt;&gt;  I do have a source on Turn Key fuel injected engines.  These are the
single
throttle body, built for the Type 1 beetles in Mexico.  They cost (last time
I checked) over 3000 dollars, but do come complete down to the heater boxes
and type 1 muffler.  I do not feel these would work well in a bus as the
torque band in these are funny.  Also they are other items necessary to make
them work, fuel pump, return lines, brain box and wiring harness, etc.  All
these items would bring the cost up to well over 4000 dollars, is it worth
it?  It would be better to buy a new VW Mexico engine and then buy a late SB
fuel injected to swipe the parts from, but then again I haven't seen a FI
beetle
in ages, as most have been converted to carbs.  A couple of years ago
one of my suppliers had Brand New German FI engines for 4500 dollars
complete with gas  tank, lines, fuel pump, harness, brain, sensors, etc.,
but
again these were for beetles.
