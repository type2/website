Subject: RE: BUS / VANAGON Tires (Tyres?)

I noticed the following :::

I received a phone call this afternoon from a Michelin &quot;Sales Engineer&quot;, 
calling from Michelin's North American headquarters, in response to my
recent e-mail inquiry.

First, the Michelin XC4S 185R14 Reinforced tire that I &quot;discovered&quot; in
the Sam's Club catalog has been discontinued.


I answer the following  :::

When I was looking for teh carpenter's bubble protractor at Sears, I
went to the tire section and noticed that Sears had a listing AND A
PICTURE of the tire in question (in the Michelin book).  Mildly
agressive thread is the understatement of the year!!  This picture had
knobbies all over the tire.

(sorry for the late $0.02)
