Subject: Re: [T2] nut size and Wurth Exhaust Paste questions

&gt; Does anyone happen to know the nut size for the studs that go from the head
&gt; to the heat exchangers on a pancake motor (73 to be precise)  I wanted to
&gt; see if I could find the 12 mm head nuts but need to know the size.

I just picked up some Stainless Steel nuts (8mm) for this same thing. I
couldn't find anyone that carried all-metal lock nuts so I opted for the
all-metal stainless steel nut w/ lock washer. Has held great so far.

&gt; Also I just received my tube of Wurth exhaust paste.  Anyone used this stuff
&gt; before?  Have any ideas as to how your supposed to use it or cure it?  The
&gt; instructions on the tube are written in another language that I do not know.

What is Wurth exhaust paste?
