Subject: Re: [T2] loose antenna

I recently installed a new antennae on my 73 Bus. I had a similar problem
where the antenna just wouldn't keep still.. it would get loose, or wiggle
around. What I ended up doing was, I got two oversized washers. One for the
15mm nut, and one for the 10mm nut. I then got a set of matching rubber
washers. I put the rubber washers on first, and then put the steel washers
on next. Then, I tightened down the nuts as tight as I could. That was
enough to give the antenna a good solid base. 

In addition, I also put blue RTV sealant underneath the antenna mast where
it meets the body. I actually put more than I needed, and then just wiped
off the rest after I installed it. I wanted to make ABSOLUTELY sure that I
wasn't going to get any leaks into the Bus. 

It hasn't moved an inch since.
