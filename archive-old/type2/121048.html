Subject: Re: [T2] fuel rail ports

got me, however, a suggestion to those that might not like the vw fuel 
pressure hookup.  Go to the junkyard, pick up a fuel pressure hookup 
from a ford, chop your fuel line, clamp that sucker in and enjoy the 
luxury of a screw-on fuel pressure tester.  It's such a dream compared 
to that dopey screw on the rail.

This probably helps you in no way, but I thought I'd say it anyways ;)

good luck!
MIke

&gt; Does anyone know if the fuel rail port for attaching pressure testers is the same for L-Jet as it is for the later Digijet fuel rail VW used?
