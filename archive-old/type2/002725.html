Subject: vacuum advance distributors and why won't she advance

I have a question, it's for my very stock 65 bus.  I know wrong list but I
thought someone might have the answer.  The distributor seems to be working
but it will not advance.  The port from the carb appears to be clogged.  If
you suck on the tube to the distributor it will advance but not when it is
hooked up properly.  We tried using a wire to clean the tube and also spraying
some contact cleaner with a straw ( all out of carb cleaner)  Still no dice.
Any ideas??
