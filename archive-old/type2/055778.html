Subject: [Fri] splitty in a video game

Hi all,
	This week I discovered an arcade game that has a split in it! 
The game is called &quot;Race the Rock, Alcratraz Edition&quot; made by Atari.
For 50 cents I raced around San Francisco at speeds reaching 130 mph
  =8^O    At those speeds you tend to sail over steep downhills such as
Lumbard St. ;)
	At the beginning you can choose which car you want to use. The
split is a little down on the &quot;speed&quot; ranking, but much easier to steer
due to the better &quot;control&quot; ranking (real fantasy here!). 
	Its a little tricky finding the split...at the screen where you
choose your car, move the pointer to the car on the far left (novice) and
push the &quot;view&quot; button on the dash a few times to get it to come up. Press
the gas pedal to choose it.

Its amazing what software people are doing with 36hp motors these days!

P.S. Thanks to the people who replied to my seized tranny question. She is
resting peacefully in the garage until funds and time are
available...serious bodywork has also been posponed :(
