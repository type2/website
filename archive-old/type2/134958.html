Subject: Fw: [T2] Camping heat

Dead right Gerald. In the UK we get 240V AC - which means our electricity is
twice as good as yours. :-O

Thanks for all the replies. It looks like this will be a good idea although
I like the oil-filled radiator idea as well but suspect this will take
longer to give off heat.

I guess I should have explained that what I am looking for is heat while
static and connected to the mains on a campground. Propex looks good but I
have a BN4 in the shed awaiting fitting. I won't want to run that while
static though - the electric heater will be much cheaper (we don't get cheap
petrol). Personally I'm looking forward to having a toasty van in the cold
mornings and evenings when I want them. Working inside the van during the
winter will be much nicer as well.

Phil

&gt;
&gt; I am a little concerned about the length of the extension cord you will
&gt; need.
&gt;
&gt; You do realize that it runs on 240V Euro voltage?

With a .co_dot_uk address I would hope so. ;-)
