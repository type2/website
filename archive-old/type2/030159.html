&gt; I guess maybe there's not much disagreement, except in inference. I don't
&gt; really clean them or take them apart in any way except to WIPE the old grease
&gt; off the outside (inside the boot) of the joint with paper towels. I NEVER
&gt; take them apart.

My problem with &quot;surgical&quot; cleaning is that it removes the lubricating
film from the balls and races.  Even if you carefully repack the CV, it
will still need to cycle a few times to get the grease in intimate contact
with the meshing surfaces.  There is also the issue of how clean the
solvent really is.  Unless you're careful, fine grit might also be
introduced into the joint.
  
&gt; I'd not recommend such a strategy in desert climates or where you knew there
&gt; was a good deal of contamination. And yes, the boots are usually shot.

I inspect the boots quite often and change them at the first sign of a
grease ooze.  At this point, it is unlikely that dirt will have found its
way to the joint, and it will usually be caught in the grease that is
wiped away and discarded.  I only take one joint off of the axle and
install both boots from that end.

One important step that hasn't been mentioned is that the joints and
flanges should be cleaned really well before unbolting the joints.  No
sense introducing dirt into the joints!

&gt; What I'd really intended on was to ramble into a discussion of what wondrous
&gt; things these are and ask whether anyone knew who'd thought them up. Very
&gt; early 911's (64-66) used non-CV u-joints called Nadellas. Corvairs, Tempests,
&gt; 63 up  Corvettes also used Spicer-type u-joints which did not work as good as
&gt; these.

Datsun used regular universal joints on their IRS setups These were
trouble-free in my experience.  The disadvantage of the U-joint setup is
that they had to include splines to allow the axle to change length as the
U-joints couldn't absorb length changes as CV joints do.
