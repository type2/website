Subject: Door seal replacement

O sublime list,

I am in the process of replacing the front door seals on my bus, and I am
casting about for ideas on how to remove the old glue fairly quickly and
without scarring the inside surfaces of the door frames.  One idea is to heat
the old glue (good name for a bus) with a propane torch set on low flame, then
scrape the goo off with something wooden .. ??
