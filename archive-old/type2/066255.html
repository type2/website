Subject: Losing Gears in Pairs

Two posts in one day on losing gears! wow!

While &quot;lost gears&quot; can be a sign of a dead tranny, often they can be
&quot;found&quot; by adjusting the linkage.  I am probable the worst person to be
posting on this, as I have never run the procedure sucessfully, but let me
relate what *ought* to happen: (I encourage anyone who *really* knows how
to do this to follow up)

At the bottom of the shift lever in a breadloaf era bus there is a metal
cap bolted to the floor with a boot on it.  Two bolts go through the cap
into the floor.  Between the cap and the floor is a small, oddly shaped
&quot;washer&quot; that establishes the limits of the shift rod travel.  By moving
this washer around, you adjust where the shift rod looks for gears.  If
it moves on its own, then gears can dissapear like magic.  If it moves to
the left, then 3rd &amp; 4th are gone, if it moves right, 1st &amp; 2nd disappear.
It has happened to me enough times that I recognize the symptom, and I
know that if I could get the plate back into the proper position, my life
would be simpler, but I have never succesfully gotten it into the &quot;sweet
spot&quot;.  Fortunately my mechanic only charges $50 for a &quot;linkage
adjustment&quot;. :-)

                           Hoping I just saved a good tranny...
