Subject: sudden loss of brake fluid: Welcome to Brake Repair 101?

Greetings: 

On my way to a friend's house for Thanksgiving dinner tonight in my bus
[the &quot;Alice's Restaurant&quot; overtones were heavy], the brakes went spongy
for two or three pumps, then pretty much disappeared.  Pulled into a
parking lot and checked: The brake fluid had gone out through the left
rear wheel.  [&quot;Yessir, Officer Obie, sir, I cannot tell a lie:  I *parked*
my bus over that puddle of brake fluid.&quot;]

Thanksgiving day traffic at 4pm is very light, so with a friend to follow
me I crept home [you've heard me complain about living at the top of a
hill; not today].  We went back to our friend's place and had a
Thanksgiving dinner that couldn't be beat.  I got home a couple hours ago
and have been reading up on brake repair for a 1970 bus [drum brakes] ever
since. 

After triangulating among Haynes, Chilton, Clymer, and Bentley, with some
Hoover thrown in for Kentucky windage, I'm figuring brake cylinder here. 
[Sure, obvious to you pros (if that's really it), but something of a
Rosetta Stone moment for a rookie.]

Well, I was only gonna do some writing on Friday anyway, right?  So:

1. Does the diagnosis sound right?  With the wheel on I can only see that
fluid's coming out from inside the brake drum.  When I get the wheel off,
what specifically should I be looking for?  Even if I've sussed out the
right place to start looking, I'm still not experienced enough yet to
understand what kind of failure would have caused this kind of
spectacularly abrupt problem--something broke?  fell off?  came unscrewed?
got plugged up? something else? 

2. Assuming it's the brake cylinder:  Rebuild or replace?  If badly pitted, 
then replace; but are there any other considerations?  Time versus money? 
Completely right versus nearly right?

3. Am I out for a set of shoes now, too?  Is this likely to have ruined
them from contact with brake fluid? 

4. At what point will any of this work on the left rear brakes require 
work on the right rear brakes too?  

5. While I have the thing apart, what else should I be looking for?

Thanks in advance for any advice.

p.s.  Ken, even though it's Friday on the West Coast, I sweartogod I'm not
trying to resurrect that &quot;bumper sticker&quot; thread, but:  Our county traffic
engineers office is giving out bumper stickers that say I BRAKE FOR RED
LIGHTS, though they seem a little reluctant to send them to people outside
the county.  I'm investigating further; if anyone's interested, send me a
private e-mail and I'll let you know what I find out.
