240 is not bad.  Slow down to 65, temp goes down maybe.
Check the list on this subject, lots of stuff and suggestions.
Dont suggest changing to synthetic unless your bus has recently been rebuilt, 
check the list on this too,  seems to be an ongoing debate on dinoe oil vs. 
sythetic, some quite entertaining...
Aloha,
