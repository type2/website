How about &quot;none&quot; (from JC Whitney)?

I looked up a place here in Dallas that sells 3/8&quot; thick sound deadening
insulation for underneath automotive carpet (Called &quot;Jute&quot;, I think,
sounded like &quot;Jewt&quot;).  I bought 10 yards of the stuff for $2.25/yard.
Compare that to JC Whipme's price of $12.49 for 2 yards plus shipping.
Whipme's stuff does have a foil coating to reflect heat, but I could care
less about heat shielding.  Otherwise it appears to be the same stuff.  I
am in the process of installing it in the front of the bus - I'm sticking
it to the metal with spray adhesive.
Later it will go in the doors and walls as well, with a double layer over
the engine compartment.  I'm getting tired of having a noisy bus.  I'll
post the results as soon as I get her back on the road.
