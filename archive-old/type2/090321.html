Subject: Re: [T2] Front Brakes Question, how to distinguish '71-'72 calipers
 from '73 on

&gt; I wonder what I have now.  What is necessary to make the '71-'71 to '73+
&gt; switch.  It is the steering knuckle, or just the hub??  What rotors do I
&gt; use?  What calipers?  I am tempted to just order all '73+ stuff and hope for
&gt; the best.

You need spindles, calipers, hub, rotor and (I think) dust shield.  In
other words, everything between the ball joints and the wheel.

Don't expect stronger braking, just longer pad life.
