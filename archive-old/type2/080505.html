Subject: Inside/Outside

I am having a problem with the sliding door on my '76.  Within the last few weeks, it has gotten progressively harder to open the door from the outside.  At this point I 
have to virtually put all of my weight on the handle to open it.  However, from the inside, it opens as easily a ever.  Are the mechanisms/gears (?) that open the door 
different for the inside handle.  If so, is it possible to rebuild/repair the outside handle or do I need to replace the whole thing?  Knowing this upfront will save me a good 
deal of time this weekend. 

Thanks,

--kevin--
