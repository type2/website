&gt; Does someone have knowledge of the types of auto trannies that were

&gt; of engines would they fit?

the auto trannies were primarialy avaliable in the USA and Canada on
vehicles with type 4 engines

the later ones (after 1975) were modified versions of the same tranny used
in the Rabbit (Golf) and Jetta VW's and Audi 100 cars and were pretty
reliable.
