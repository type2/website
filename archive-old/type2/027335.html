Hey all,

My bro and I drove from NY in my 71 Camper to Norwalk, CT VW Show.  After a 
long morning rain, the sun finally came out and a few more people showed up.
   Lots of cool Type 2 - a nice barn door panel bus, early 50's.
On the way home I even got a wave from a old couple in a brand new Eurovan 
as the flew by my puny 1641cc Camper.
  hoping the Litchfield CT in 2 weeks is sunny  (2 straight weeks of rain in 
NY is ENOUGH!)
