Subject: Re: [T2] STUPID QUESTION... PLEASE HELP

&gt;QUESTION.... ARE THOSE BOLTS REQUIRED.  SHOULDN'T THE
&gt;TRANNY SWING FREE WITH THE ENGINE WITH NO MOUNTS IN
&gt;THE MIDDLE OF THE TRANS AND ENGINE (I.E. ABOVE THE
&gt;BELL HOUSING)?????????????????

No the late baywindows have an engine/tranny mount right above the 
bellhousing. You do not need to support the tranny in any way.

Inspect the rubber mounts and make sure they are not cracked. Mine are torn 
and the whole drivetrain has slid over 1&quot; and the steel mount is contacting 
the steel frame of the Westy. Makes for a noisy drivetrain. This is the 
perfect time to replace them.

As I am not driving mine, I don't here my noisy drivetrain.

I'm ex-Navy. 6 Years.
