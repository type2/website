Subject: smells like gas.

Howdy everyone, I have a 77 westi, all stock.  Here is my problem:  I can
smell gas fumes when I have the heater on.  When the heater is off there
are no gas fumes, at all.  I have looked all over and can't find any sign
of leaking.  I have read all the back posts about cracks in the hoses and
fuel sloshing and that but I can only smell it when the heater is on.  I
live in Bellingham Washington and if I can't get this worked out I am
going to go brain dead by spring.  


Live to drive, drive to live.

Marcus
