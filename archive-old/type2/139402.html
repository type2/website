Subject: Re: [T2] Fuel line replacement

Hi Bart,

What year is your bus? Unless we know that it's hard to tell you how
the lines should be routed.

My personal preference is to put the fuel filter right after the tank,
so as to make for as few connections in the engine compartment as
possible. The downside of this is that it's harder to check for debris.

I think it's very important to put the fuel filter in front of the
pump. This protects the pump from debris, and also protects the filter
from building up pressure if it gets clogged. If a clogged filter is
placed after the pump, the pressure build up would be a lot more likely
to rupture a line, and this could lead to  a fire. Not good. And why
take the chance of debris in the fuel pump, they're a lot more
expensive than filters are.

Finally, Hose clamps should be used on every connection.


Happy trails,

&gt; OK, now I will replace all of the fuel lines. I want to add a fuel
&gt; filter,
&gt; which is the best place to connect it? And I think the original fuel
&gt; line
&gt; under the bus is rather loosely attached Any advice on this? How
&gt; should
&gt; this line be attached and which pathway to follow?
