If you still haven't found a shop and still need help,  I can help.  I'm in
Salt Lake and have a spare Alternator and time to put one in.  I f you
still need help call me on my mobile  801-726-1070, if no one answers call
801-295-0970 and leave a message where you are and a phone #.   (I forgot
to charge my portable mobile so if I'm away from the car my built in  will
tell me I had a call.)   I can take a spare battery down and pick her up.

Have fun

I've tried all the type2 resources, but still no luck. My wife is getting a
tow into Provo tonight, then in the morning we'll keep on looking. Any help
on finding a provo VW shop would be great.

What a trip it has been, first the overheating, then the starter motor, now
the Altrenator.

Thanks!
