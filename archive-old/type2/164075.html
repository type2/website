Subject: Re: [T2] scary noise

Thanks for the responses guys. I'll check the CV's, wheels, lugs and try to
pinpoint the sound. Hopefully I'm not out a bunch a bread. I'll post an
update when I find out more.

&gt;If that is not the case, jack up your bus and place two HD jackstands on
the rear jackpoints so just the rear wheels are off the &gt;ground. Block the
front tires from the front and back. Run it in 1st gear at idle and see if
you can ID the noise.


&gt;Things that may come loose:

&gt;Drive Axles

&gt;Wheels (re-torque them to 94ft/lbs)

&gt;Transmission throw out bearing (pre-71, 71-79 would be rare)

&gt;Pressure Plate coming loose (uncommon)

&gt;Forign object caught in your drive axles and whapping against the car.


&gt;Let me know what it turns out to be! My money is on the drive axle coming
loose.
