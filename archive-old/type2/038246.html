&gt; Hi all,
&gt; 
&gt;       I was fixing a split cv boot.  I found some wear on the joints but I
&gt; do not know what is acceptable.  I thought the balls would snap into the
&gt; middle cage.  Most of mine just fall out.  There are shiny spots on the
&gt; outside of the cage but you can't feel them with your fingernail.  There are
&gt; wear spots on the outside part of the joint where the balls ride.  These you
&gt; can feel.

Several years ago, I returned a &quot;questionable&quot; CV to service because of a
lack of funds.  It's still doing its job.  With this piece of data, I've
come to the conclusion that it's impossible to predict the future life of
a CV.  If it's not making noise, I don't replace it!

Add to this the caveat that I carry a spare CV, grease, and boots with me
in the parts box.  If it does go, I can fix it on the road.  I've even
become so lazy as to not clean the CVs when I change the boots.  I just
wipe out what grease I can with paper towels and pack in new.  Of course,
if the boot has been really torn, you have to do the complete cleaning 
job.

  Interesting thing,  one of the circle clips that hold the shaft
&gt; to the inner part of the cv was not there.  I looked for it in the greasy
&gt; flange but it wasn't there either.  Someone had to put it together that way.
&gt; Any insight  would be appreciated.

You need to replace it.  Be sure that the snap ring groove is clean and
square.  It helps to machine a small groove in the ends of the snap ring
with a small carbide cutter in a Dremel (perhaps a file will work) to make
installation of the snap ring easier.  Otherwise, it'll slip off of your
snap ring pliars and fly to the farthest corner of your garage.
