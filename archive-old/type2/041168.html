&gt; I'd be very careful handling and disposing of that stuff. If the engine is
&gt; old enough to have burned leaded gas, then the gray paste may well be lead
&gt; residue. The lead didn't all go out the exhaust pipe, some of ended up in
&gt; the oil and then in the sump.

Or it could be bearing alloy, which had some lead in it.  The only special
handling it needs is &quot;don't eat it&quot; which I have a feeling is already
being complied with.  Otherwise just include it with the used oil for
recycling.  That's what we pay the recyclers for!
