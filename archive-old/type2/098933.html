Subject: Re: [T2] Portable propane heater report

Chris,
I've had one of these units for two years, and it is a excellent heating
source--and very portable--good for a Bus or Van--and it can be hooked
up directly to a campmobiles propane tank, for a even longer heating
duration. 
However--it sure doesn't heat my garage too good--and an uninsulated
shed I think may be a little tough too--maybe a small bedroom with the
door closed--it would be OK---

9000 BTU's aint really that much--

Later,

Terry

We had forecasts of ice and snow this past week here in Middle TN. My
childhood was on a TN mountain where our power went our frequently
leaving us with no heat beyond the fireplace. due to ice storms. We
don't get alot fo snow - we get ice. My current house has no fireplace
so i was concerned the ice might knock out the power and leave us cold.
It was time to buy a heater.. 
I didn't want a kerosene heater inside my house (shop okay, not the
house). Propane was my preferred solution. 
I bought a Mr. Heater MH9B 9,000 BTU Portable Buddy Propane Heater at
Lowe's for $79 or so. 
Let me report I am VERY happy with this heater,. 
It starts easily. Heats well enough to keep me warm in the garage.
Should heat a room in the house just fine and best of all will heat our
Westfalia for winter camping - someday when our Westy moves under it's
own power again... &lt;grin&gt; 
Supposed to run 6-8 hours on a $2.50 propane tank and 80-110 hours on a
large propane tank from a BBQ grill with a hose they want to sell you
and me separately.

If you need to heat you van, heat your shed while you work, etc. give
this one a look. 
It's got a tip over shut off feature and a carbon monoxide safety (don't
trust your life to this of course). 
Enjoy.FWIW.
