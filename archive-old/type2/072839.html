&gt;&gt;Now, am wondering about the issue of valve seats that everyone talks about.
As I follow it, there's some kind of modification that is important to make
in the process of rebuilding the heads. What exactly should be done to the
head to help prevent the dropped valve seats?&gt;&gt;

I believe the process typically used to help prevent dropped valve seats is
called &quot;shot peening&quot;
