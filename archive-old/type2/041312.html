Subject: Organizing a VW get together

Ive received quite a bit of response for a little get together I'm planning.
This started out as a few of my bus buddies and i reserving a camping spot
on the next island over from ours.  We decided not to be greedy with the
goodtimes and invite the VW world. So here is more info for those who asked.
I'd also love some organizational tips from those whove done this sort of
thing before.  I'd like this to be a safe, well planned family event. :)

I'm in the process of trying to plan an informal Buses, Bonfires, and BBQ
party at Assateauqe Island National Park.  This is on the coast of Maryland
right next to Ocean City for those who dont know.  Id like to plan it for
August sometime.(suggested dates are welcome)  If anyone is interested in
doing the wild pony pedestrian slalom to a parkinglot for some conversation
on the beach and a late night bonfire and clambake/bbq please let me know.
Id like to make this a well planned gathering so I'd love some help with
organizing it if anyone is interested.  There will be overnight camping
available if all the sites arent booked up yet, so Im gonna try to finalize
all the information, including securing the fire permits within 2 weeks.
I'll also let people know about camping info as well.

If your not sure where assateaque is, try hitting mapquest with this
address.  
5 S. Baltimore Ave
Ocean City MD 21842.
This is my store address, and its only 10 minutes away from the island.
That should help you in determining if you want to make the trip.

If you respond directly to me, please let me know what area of the country
your from.
