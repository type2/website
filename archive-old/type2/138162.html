Subject: Re: [T2] VWTrends rumor

I hope this rumor isn't true.  I just got my Feb issue a few days ago.  
I personally like getting things in the mail. I also like getting a 
hard copy to look at instead of it all being on the internet.   Guess I 
might have to subscribe to another vw mag from the UK.  I get the 
Camper magazine &amp; there's another one I saw that I might have to get if 
vw trends is gone.

VW Trends just started a bus resto article to. : (
happy bussing,
Keri
