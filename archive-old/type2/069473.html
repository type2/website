Subject: brake warning light

I don't suppose any of you could tell me
how to wire up a brake warning light to 
the tandem master cylinders.  The senders each have
three terminals, so there would be six wires.  I think
the wires are &quot;there&quot;.

The rule on staying alive as a forcaster is to give 'em a number or give
'em a date, but never give 'em both at once.  -- Jane Bryant Quinn
