&gt; Hi Volks......Here's the situation.  I have a '79 westy and the
&gt; converter that recharges my second battery (when I'm hooked up to &quot;shore
&gt; power&quot;) doesn't seem to be working.  Also, the refrig doesn't work when
&gt; I'm connected to 110v power UNLESS the timer (used only when recharging
&gt; the 2nd battery) is turned on.  So.....what's up with that?
&gt;Is the converter on the fritz?

--&gt;  Probably not.  When you find the converter (see below) you'll notice
a few of those push-on spade connectors we all know and love in the wiring
around it.  Make sure they're all pushed together.  All my problems of
this kind have come from these ending up pulled apart.  If your fridge can
get power *at all* then the converter itself is working.

&gt; I pulled off the panel for the frig controls and all seems in
&gt; order....but where exactly is the 110 to 12v converter located?

--&gt;  Lift up your back seat (AKA Z-bed) and look on the left side of the
van (to your right as you face the rear.)  If it's like mine it'll look
like a big transformer (chunk of iron, basically) with some stuff bolted
to it and wires leading away.  (Note:  This is on my 1975 Westfalian --
different years may have moved things around.)
