Subject: Re: [T2] Bad hesitation and huge flat spot right after
  rebuild...

First an earlier post that I posted incorrectly...


MY CHECKLIST

Check vacuum lines again, but this time with a vacuum tester...  Spray 
intakes with starter fluid...

Adjust valves (they were originally adjusted out of the bus)

Look at plugs and check gapping...

Double check firing order...

Ive got a friends airbox with AFM, gonna try it..     They are from a 78 FI 
2L bus as well...

Also have his ECU, gonna try it..   How can I tell if its a California ECU?

Check Aux. air regulator, clean and do T/S steps in FI manual to test...

Different coil?  Reset points..

I also have an SVDA distributor to try, Ive put 2 009s in, so prolly not it, 
but might as well.....

There are other steps in the new manuals I have, but they are not right here 
to list...


Thanks in advance, til later....
Aaron

Sorry for this long post...





-Well, I pretty much got through my checklist and many things got added 
along the way...
-The vacuum lines that I tested all had 10 pounds pressure...  I could not 
find the specs in the Bentley or the other manuals I have...
-I pulled the ground connector from under the air plenum off and cleaned it 
and where it bolts on the case....
-The vacuum from the hose that in connected to the brake booster and the 
decel valve also has 10 pounds, tells me the brake booster may be OK?
-The line coming from the throttle body got up to 25 pounds or so when the 
engine revs...
-Sprayed carb cleaner on my intakes while the engine ran, but heard no 
change.....
-All of my injectors had 2.6-2.7 Ohm resistance values...
-I wanted to check the spray pattern, but time was running short and I did 
not really know of a safe way to do it...
-Reset the points to 50 and the timing was set to 30 degrees BTDC...
-I tested the fuel pressure with and without the vacuum line on the fuel 
press. reg.
-There is 32-33 pounds WITH and      37 or so WITHOUT...   High, but pretty 
close....
-I checked the voltage coming into the injectors at the harness and they 
were high... The book says 4-5 or so, but I was getting like 9 volts...
-Pulled all the plugs and checked them, they were fine, but I regapped them 
to spec...
-Adjusted the valves ice cold to 1 and a half turns in after the adjustment 
screw BARELY touches the valve...
-The Aux air regulator I heated up and the flap closed..  I then put it 
outside for a while and it opened up....
-I tested the Ohm load and it was 27 or so, within spec anyway....  I found 
a couple of loose plugs, but thats it....
-I hear a squealing when the engine decelerates...  Its not the fan, and 
only happens when the engine decelerates...
-Might be an air leak, the sound has been there since the engine went back 
in...
-I suspected the decel valve, so I tested it by plugging the air box 
connection up and testing the vacuum at deceleration...
-It barely went up at all...  I then tested it by hand, to feel the vacuum, 
and its not much to speak of...
-I then disconnected ALL of the vacuum lines going in or out of the decel 
valve and started the engine...
-The noise was still there, so its not the decel valve...  I kinda sounds 
like it could be coming from the fuel pressure reg., but not sure...
-Tried a friend's air box with his air flow meter and the symptoms were the 
same.... Also the &quot;S&quot; tube that goes with it...

So there is more, but this is long enough...

I REALLY need help here, Im hitting walls...  My bus has started hitting me, 
hard (Ill tell ya later)

As always, thank you....
Aaron
