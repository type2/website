Subject: oil pressure sender replacement

the past few times i have driven my bus the oil light has flickered.
i have checked the oil level.  it was initially a little low, but
i topped it off &amp; the idiot light on the dash is still coming on.  it 
does not happen often, though.

when the light flickers, i am able to get it to go off by stepping on the
gas pedal very lightly.

so...i am hoping it is just a bad sender.  i just got back from the
FLAPS &amp; purchased one there.  i did look up the part # &amp; it appears i did
get the right one. (021 919 081B - 72 bus, 1700 cc motor)

i am going to be attempting replacement of the sender this evening or
tomorrow evening.  i know this might sound simple to some of you (&amp; it
probably is) but i think i just need a confidence booster.

can anyone provide me with some critical info about this procedure?
the guy at the FLAPS said its pretty much a &quot;take out the old one &amp; 
put in the new one&quot; kind of task.

any tips, warnings, or advice would be much appreciated.  oh yeah, please
pmail as i am lurking in digest mode.

sorry to be so long winded.

TIA!!!!
