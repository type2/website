&gt; Hey, guys.  My driver's side door latch is sometimes hard to open.
Usually it works ok, but occasionally I have to use both hands to squeeze
hard enough for it to open.  I tried PB Blaster in it but no help.  I
haven't taken the door panel off and looked around yet but I just
wondered if this is a common bus problem and how it's fixed.  Thanks....KR

After 30 years a lot of parts get stiff!

Best route is to take the whole latch assembly out of the door, clean it,
and lube it.  Check for the infamous broken/missing spring (see the tech
library) while you are at it.

Do it soon before you break something.  Pot metal doesn't bend!
