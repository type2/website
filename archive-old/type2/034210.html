Dave 
   Thanks for the reply. I've heard the same about the sunroof,but still want 
to try it. It's better than an open hole, or like it is now with a camper top 
tied down w/o the canvas which is almost as bad. I intend to bring it back to 
as near stock as I can afford. This will be a lot of work I understand but I 
think in the end it'll be worth it.
Thanks again 
Ed
