Greetings,

First things first,  thanks to everyone who responded to my requests for
help.  I must admit that I sounded damn pathetic, but I'm sure you've all
been there.  I did learn that I should just relax and THINK.  

I changed the position of the arm inside of the AFM and it runs like a top.  I
could see a small area of the board was worn towards the top of the
arm's path.  I don't know why I didn't check this, it's only mentioned 1
million times in the archives.  I think that I was afraid that I would destroy a
very expensive part.  The only good part out of all my troubleshooting is
that I have replaced almost everything electrical and have &quot;tuned&quot; it to
perfection.  This thing runs like a clock, through the entire RPM range.  I
even ordered the vacuum-can for the distributer.  The &quot;suck test&quot;
showed that the points move under vacuum, but if I plug the hose with my
tongue, they slowly move back to their original position.  The part is $40
and will take 2 weeks to arrive, but it should improve my advance curve.

Now for an electrical question.   There are 2 wires that come from the
secondary battery reley and head towards the main battery.  One is
connected to the voltage regulator and the other is just laying there next
to the main battery.  This is probably included in every &quot;Automotive
Electronics 101&quot; class, but this is my very weakest area.  Does this wire
go to the + or the - side of the main battery?  My refrigerator has been
removed but I believe that the secondary battery also runs my sink pump. 
The wiring diagram that I have doesn't say that it does, but I can follow
the wires back and it sure looks like that is where they go.  I'm getting a
new deep cycle battery this week and would like to make sure that I
connect it properly.   Any Help?

TIA
Rob
