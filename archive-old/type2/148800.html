Subject: Re: [T2] i need some winter driving tips

&lt;&lt; daytime high is -35C (which is awful close to -35F). Daytime high of
-35 means I got it started when it was -40. That's the pre-windchill
number.&gt;&gt;

Not as cold as the &quot; Land of Eternal Cold&quot;, Hibbing Minnesota.

I was up there when I was a kid , and -55 below was the norm.

&gt;&gt;I've got snow tires on all four wheels (Nokian Hakkappeliitta CQ).&gt;&gt;

Super tire's for ice and snow

&lt;&lt; so I've also got an automatic trickle charger permanently installed
to keep the battery topped up.&gt;&gt;

A real good idea, and used in conjunction th an engine heater , you'd
never have an problems firing the &quot;Ole Girl&quot; up.

&lt;&lt;Having driven a few automatics in the winter, I can second Bob's point
on throwing it into neutral when you're trying to come to a stop on ice
&gt;&gt;

This one I missed and can't get behind.
Why wouldn't you want to use the engine as a brake on ice?

Unless your flying up to the intended stop at 80 mph there is no reason
to slip the trans into neutral.
Using the engine to slow down is good. 


&lt;&lt; put the automatic into 2nd when starting on ice because there's less
torque,..

The trans will always still start you going in first gear, regardless of
where the selector is.

&lt;&lt;I think it's the consensus of the list that heating the interior of
the bus with an electric heater while driving is going to be futile. &gt;&gt;

The hot set up ( no pun intended) is to pre warm up the interior when
you start the vehicle--using either a Mr. Buddy heater , Coleman,
whatever.

It'll make your entrance into the Bus more pleasurable to your bottom
end, and it'll help the Bus continue being warm just with the engine
heat.

If it really cold out I leave the Mr. Buddy Heater running in back.

It sure helps compensate for what the vehicles heater doesn't do in
really cold weather.
