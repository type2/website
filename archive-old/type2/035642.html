check your fuel filter,  

I'm in the Ft Meade Area (OK Baltimore) and might occasionally be able to
give you a hand, but I've been fuel injected for 15+ years so I'm digging
from the past to remember the carb problems...

but it sure sounds like a fuel blockage of some sort...

1.  check flow
2.  check fuel filter, do you have flow on both sides
3.  pull fuel line in front of fuel pump, gas should flow from line
4.  pick up a cheap electric fuel pump from the local FLAPS and try it
before spending a lot of time and $$ on the stock fuel pump.
5.  don't think 6 month old gas is a real problem but there might have
been some water collected in the system over a period of time.  might want
to just drain the fuel tank and put in some fresh gas.
