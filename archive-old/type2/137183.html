Subject: Re: [VB] charging questions

Sam,
First this is assuming that the voltage readings you are quoting are 
from the gauge you have added up front?  If this is true then we also 
have similar readings as there are voltage drops to the front do to: 
age, wire size, connections, added current requirements from other than 
stock requirements, and ???
Now if you take these reading at the battery you should see 13+ volts as 
it should with the rpms up.
Bottom line we think it the battery replace it. But, have you checked 
the fluid levels in the battery?
P &amp; C

It starts and the voltage meter goes up to 14-15 volts. Then the  voltage
drops to 12 volts as I expect.
I then put on the lights and wipers and the voltage drops below 10  Volts.
It stays there even when the engine is revved up.

I have regrets to use a transistorized regulator as I will be 
susceptible  to
an EMP. The early buses are one of the few cars that will survive, but 
who is
going to nuke us?

Change the regulator as to be ready :)
