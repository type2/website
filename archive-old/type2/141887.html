Subject: T1 Oil Flow Animation, Anyone?

Oil of you -

Subject sez it all. I'm looking for the path that oil would take from the re-entry of a full flow system until the oil/pressure hits the stock oil pressure sender. In particular, is that oil that hits the stock oil pressure sender still filtered (from the external oil filter)?

Oh, and if anyone knows of a neat oil path animation, I'd love to see it.

Thanks -

Mike
