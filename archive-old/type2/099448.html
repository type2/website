Subject: Re: [T2] Synthetic Oil

What weight?

My oil pressures stayed the same for 3 vehicles.

Sure you didn't put 0W-20 in there? &lt;VBG&gt;

&gt;After about 40 minutes running at 55 - 60 over
&gt;gently rolling terrain I can officially state that Mobil 1 SUCKS!!!
&gt;Absolutely the WORST oil pressure readings across the board! Oil temp stayed
&gt;in the normal range, maxed at about 220; head temps were also normal. The
&gt;pressure dropped to about 25psi at 55 mph, and for the first time ever the
&gt;oil light came on at idle.
&gt;
&gt;The Mobil 12 comes out tomorrow and the Kendall goes back in. Even the cheap
&gt;NAPA brand 10w40 did better than that.
