Subject: Tranny hanger req'd!

Hi Volks,

Spent a lot of this weekend ferrying vehicles and trailers back and forth in
order to get together with Denmeister to make the motor swap happen between
my 73 westy and the 79 van that I brought back last month from Matt in NH.
Remember that old puzzle with the farmer who has a fox, chicken and a sack
of grain to get across a river? That was me, yesterday. Dennis' place is
about 60 miles from me. I meant to spread the work out over the full weekend
but we were grounded Friday by some severe weather that swept through here.

The good news is that the motor is now out of the 73, and the chassis has
been returned to Scarborough so it can be properly processed (read: stripped
of every conceivably useful bit, then scrapped). Plus the 79 is up at
Dennis's, where the correct tools and expertise can be brought to bear.

Due to a combination of aggressive driving habits, road conditions and the
trailer hitch hanging down low on my 73 westy, I find the bus is in need of
a tranny hanger. You know, the U-shaped thingy with the rubber bushing that
bolts to the trip of the transmission and is then tied to the frame of the
van with a bracket*. With that, and a new engine compartment seal, I should
be on the road, at least for a while. In the near term I will be looking at
a new muffler, heater boxes and flaps, a clutch, transmission seal, and
maybe more, on top of the bodywork and paint to be done.

At some point I recall someone on the list actually mentioned that this
particular bus (Which I got free) would be too expensive, due to the amount
that would be required to get it on the road. Certainly it would have been
so for me, if I didn't have a motor and trans. already. I *think* they were
joking, but YMMV.

Tomorrow my dad and I will be going back up in his 81 Vanagon Westy to check
the state of things, and to bring back the trailer I towed the motorcycle up
with on the first leg of the trip. By then I'll have some fresh batteries in
my digital camera so I'll probably have a website to refer you'all to when
you next hear from me.

If anyone on the list in Southern Ontario knows where to lay hands on a
tranny mount for a 73 standard, please let me know ASAP, as I'd like to get
this thing on the road (And out of Dennis' yard) before the upcoming holiday
weekend.
