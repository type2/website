Subject: Re: [T2] Timing a unique engine.

I do indeed have my carbs ported for vac, I had lowbugget take care  
of that for me. I am not sure of the compression but its a boston bob  
2L with '79 style heads.

I had her running at 7.5 so I'm glad you agreed with that.

Thanks !
Steve


&gt; I would start at 7.5 before with no vacuum. Hopefully you have a  
&gt; ported
&gt; source?
