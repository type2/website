Subject: Re: [T2] R: [T2] R: [T2] Trash into oil

This is a sound concept: Pollution is bad. The other side of the coin is 
what kind of pollution can we make that is readily absorbed by plants thus 
making a cycle that is not so bad? Burning, say bio-diesel or a carbon based 
thing like a turkey, or our human waste make a kind of pollution that is 
reabsorbed by the plants and completes the cycle. I am far more worried 
about over population, and over human density, then just by pollution alone, 
if we have the tools to complete a simple cycle.
