Subject: Which fuel sender?

I've been playing possum, after my embarrassing post to remove myself from
the list. My hard drive ate it's self &amp; I had to post from another
account-Sorry.

Having found that my '76 has a hatch for changing the fuel sender. I am
about to order one, but I am interested in whether the cylinder type &amp; the
swing arm type are cross compatible. Also does one last longer than the
other?

Our bus is in for the winter, to have major body work done. I have a 1000
questions &amp; will be posting them as separate items, other-wise all the
&quot;Re:'s&quot; get all confused!

P.S
Seasons greetings to you all!
