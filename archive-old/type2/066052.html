Those of you interested in collective ownership of vw's might talk to your
pilot friends.  Collective ownership of light aircraft is common and there
are customary forms and agreements covering use and upkeep that will keep
everyone on an even footing and prevent misunderstandings.

Where am I going to get a flywheel for a 2.0 for my 73 van?  Need to convert
an engine from auto to manual transmission.  Anyone been-there, done-that?
