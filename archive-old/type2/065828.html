Subject: Still looking for answers with 78 2.0

Hi,
Thanks to all of you that responded to my previous post about overheating. I
recieved many mesages that reassured me I may not have a problem. I decided
to post this to find out if my readings are normal. The engine is a rebuilt
2.0 in a westfalia . Running at cruising speed on a flat (or as flat as Utah
roads allow) _at_ 3400 rpm _at_ 60 mph I see the oil temperature at 220-230 and oil
pressure at 22 psi. How does this compare to your engines, the only
comparison I have is my old 71 camper that ran around 190 on the flat. Any
comments would be appreciated, I have double checked the timing and mixture
are set proper and am running 30w oil.

Thanks, Clay
