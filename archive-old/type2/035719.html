&gt; I found the wheel-bearing grease alone was too thick,
&gt; causing it to stick on colder days. Likewise, the
&gt; WD-40 was too thin and didn't last long enough. You
&gt; might also try white-lithium grease, but I'm dubious
&gt; about it lasting very long.

     The best thing to use to lube doors (or anything else for that matter)
is regular old automatic transmission fluid.  Get some nice new ATF and fill
an oil can with it, then go around the car to every hinge, and work it in
good.  I promise it's not to thick to get in, and won't evaporate like
wd-40.  Wd-40 is best used to light fires.
    And if you're trying to free rusted parts, don't bother with wd-40.  Go
on down to your local Dodge, Chrysler, Plymouth, or Jeep dealer, and ask the
guy at the parts counter to sell you a can of Mopar Rust Penetrant (AKA. heat
control valve solvent).  It won't be out on the shelf.  They only give it to
the techs.  It's the professional stuff.  It works so well.  You'd be amazed.

    Well, that's all then.
