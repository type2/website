&gt; from work, so I walked the rest of the way.  The frustrating part is, I ran 
&gt; out of gas on the other side of a hill from a gas station!

gotta do some better planning
&gt; 
&gt; I remember something about the FI system causing trouble if it's run 
&gt; completely dry.  Is this just my overactive imagination, or is there 
&gt; anything I should worry about when I finally get back to my Bus and try to 
&gt; get it started again?  I imagine it'll be a little sluggish starting, but 
&gt; I'm hoping I can just fill it and go.

diesels have problems when they run dry the FI is as you say a little
suggish starting but it shouldn't not start.  remember the FI pump only
runs when the starter is on or the engine is running so you will probably
have to crank a bit to build up presure.

&gt; Thanks in advance for any advice or suggestions...

carry a spare gas can and get your guage fixed, or at least look at it
occasionally   ;8*}
