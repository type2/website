Subject: Re: [T2] Removing doors

Hello Michael,

This procedure can be quite a PITA if they strip! I
had to replace mine due to severe east coast rust. My
luck had it that one bolt on each hindge, on each door
striped. I ended up breaking off a couple of easy
outs. Finially, after going through 3 large drill
bits, My half brother was able to remove the heads
from the remaining bolts and remove the left over bolt
ends with an easy out. I guess the ideal situation to
remove them would be to use the correct socket with an
inpact wrench and penetrating oil. Any how, I wish you
better luck than I had!

Good Luck!

&gt; Michael,
&gt; 
&gt; You don't need a 6mm allen *wrench*, you need a 6mm
&gt; allen *socket*!  Alas,
&gt; I have not seen one in 1/2&quot; drive or i'd'a bought
&gt; it, but I do have a
&gt; 1/2&quot;&gt;3/8&quot; adapter and the allen socket plus adapter
&gt; on the Sears 24&quot; long
&gt; 1/2&quot; drive flex bar will take the RIGHT off! :-) 
&gt; Make sure the heads are
&gt; scrupulously clean before you start, becuase
&gt; drilling out a stripped one
&gt; is a metric PITA.
