Subject: Re: Tranny help

There have been a few more or less helpful suggestions on this topic. Here
is my take:

- Use the 73 bellhousing on the new transmission. That way you can keep the
stater, flywheel, clutch and such and you know that it will fit. The only
new item required (aside from gear oil) is the paper gasket between
bellhousing and tranny. I have done this and it works.

- Once you have the bellhousing off. Inspect the input shafts. If the one
one the new trans shows wear were it passes through the bell housing, simply
use the one from the other tranny. It is a simple screw-in job. The way the
tranny is constructed, input shafts always have some wobble. Nothing to be
concerned about.

- On the linkage. Don't sweat, install it and see how it shifts. In my 74, I
did not modify the linkage for the later transmission and I get all gears
fine.

- The difference in physical size between the transmissions does not really
matter. The 091 will go in place. A little less room to maneuver but not big
deal. Plus, some of that extra size is in the bellhousing. Using your old
bellhousing will save you one 1 cm or so.

Cheers,

Hi Snoopy,

I've done the opposite, installing a 73 tranny into the westfakia's 79
body. The shift linkage came up about 5/8&quot; short. This put first and
third gear under the dashboard, which itself was only possible after
the shift knob was removed. Third was still impossible to reach because
the shifter ran into the emergency brake. I compensated for this by
bending the shift lever.

My guess is that your linkage is now too long, and you can't get the
lever back far enough to engage 2 and 4.

To run with the later transmission you are going to need to replace a
linkage part with something shorter, or you can bend the shift lever.

Happy trails,
