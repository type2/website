Subject: RE: sorry to see her go, but...

sorry all, i guess i forgot to include the location of my 70 deluxe westy.  
it's in southern wisconsin, about an hour west of milwaukee and a half hour 
east of madison.  i'm asking $600, but that is slightly negotiable.  i've 
stuck quite a bit of money into her, and i can't afford too much of a loss.
i forgot to mention that i've got a new set of tires for it, and 2 extra 
rims.  i started painting  the rims and putting the new tires on, but i 
haven't been able to get the old rims off to put the new ones on.
