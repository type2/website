Subject: Thanks, advice, and a P&amp;C question

Thanks to those who posted methods of cleaning the oil cooler.  IIRC Muir's
advice is to toss it and buy anew, but I couldn't really believe the thing
could never be reused.

My heads are FINALLY back.  I had a good friend (who is also an auto
mechanic) put in new valve guides, grind the valves, etc.  He's still my
good friend, but advice to those who need to have heads done; do them
yourself, unless time is truly of the essence.  I'm not gonna say how long
it took.  I'd be embarrassed for him.  The price was right, though...

Question:  having stood in my shop for a couple of months (WHOOPS!  I warn't
supposed to say that...), it would appear that the cylinders have a patina
of corrosion on the inside.  I know that I could buy new P&amp;C all around,
but...how necessary is that?  If I hone the cylinders to clean metal and
give them a proper cleaning, would that be sufficient for the cylinders?  Do
I need new rings as well?  Anything else?  Advice?  Comments?  Physical threats?

Engine is about 25K miles along on its rebuild by the PO.
