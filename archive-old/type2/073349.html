Paul asked:

&gt;When we use the turn signals, left or right, the exterior lights work
&gt;properly but both lights on the dash blink.  Things appear to be wired
&gt;correctly.  Is this normal for this year?

Yes it is.
 It's the same on my '68, and I think at least through '72.  I'm not sure
how long the tradition continued.   Maybe one of the busmasters here can
tell us * why* it's that way.
