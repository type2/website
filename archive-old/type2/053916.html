Subject: Thanks

     I just wanted to thank you all for your help.  My 76 Westy is now
running pretty good.  It took a starter (old one was smoking during test),
both batterys, &amp; battery cables.  I will try to get it through DEQ testing
on Monday.  I also need to get the water tank pump working. Thanks again.
