Greetings.

Thanks all, for your input re: New to list. It has already put me on the
right track.

Aside from the info gathered from this list, I solicited an opinon from a
mechanic, that I trust, who does a lot of work on VW's. He strongly
suggested that if I get a Vanagon water cooled, I should consider going for
one built between 87-91.

Obviously I'm leaning toward a Vanagon, and although I see the charm of the
older Type 2's, I will likely be a weekend warrior in the camping world, and
can see that the Vanagon will suite my needs. Hey who knows though, I might
see the Type 2 of my dreams, and go for it!

I'll keep you all posted.

Neil.
