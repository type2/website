Here's your chance.  We're still accepting members at the all-Friday,
all-the-time Bus list!  Open to all VW Bus enthusiasts,  1950-present.

Check it out here:

(yahoo groups is free.  That's why we're using it.  Sign up and you will be
giddy with antici.....pation!.)

___________________________________________________________________

NEWEST NEW NEWS FLASHERS!

-You do not have to RECEIVE the list to be part of it.  Go to the site, sign
up, and check the
  &quot;Read On the Web&quot; option.  Then you have all of the benefits without all
of that pesky extra email.

-We have 20mb of space to fill up in the &quot;FILES&quot; area on the website.  If
you have a
  cool pic of your bus or something bus related or bus-life related, do not
hesitate to put
  it up in the FILES.  It's a great resource.  Try to keep files under 200k.

-There is also an area for putting up links of interest to all bus owners.
Put your favorite
  links there.  I believe it's called &quot;LINKS&quot;.

-The following info is our Mission Statement.  The Mission can be yours as
well, if you
  choose to accept it.

-You can inform others of important happening in your life (or maybe
something to do with busses) automatically with the nifty CALENDAR function.
Fill it up with your fave happenings.

1st Commandment:

THOU SHALT NOT DISPENSE TECH ADVICE.

This is not to become competition with any other lists, it's simply a forum
for discussing verboten topics on days other than Fridays.  Think cheese to
the other lists' tacos.  This is an all-cheese list.

HENCE:  NO TECH ADVICE.  Am I being too loud?  No technical talk
whatsoever, this is for the other lists.  We talk about sightings, trip
reports,
toys, living on, in or near busses, frustration, anger, happiness, cops,
music,
Mustang drivers, camping spots, hot dog prices, Hell, anything we want AS
LONG AS IT AIN'T TECHNICAL!

This list will only fly if we get subscribers.  We have like 142
now,
and members want POST CONTENT ++!!  So here's your chance to get in on the
coolest new
thing since bologna with no red plastic edges!

Tell your mama, tell your papa, and your sister too!
