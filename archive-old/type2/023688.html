&quot;Cam and Exhaust will remain stock.  My question is now, with this setup,
with a stock cam, exhaust, and 009 which carb setup work. &quot;

The 009 doesn't work well with the Solex 34 PICT 3, so if you go with that
carb, you'd be better off to ditch the 009 and go with a stock dizzy.
However, when I built my engine, I didn't have the benefit of the List and I
too, wanted to stay away from dual carbs and what I perceived difficulties
therein.

Well, it has been a few years and I have learned a thing or two ;-)  I tried
the progressive Weber, and while it did perform semi OK, I did have trouble
with the carb icing (even on hot Oklahoma days).  Heat risers were in place,
etc.  I wanted a single carb so I could have an electric choke and not have to
deal with the balancing of dual carbs.  I later tried to go back to a stock
carb and dizzy with stock exhaust.  I was really disappointed in that
combination.  What I currently run are dual Kadrons with the 009.  I am quite
happy with this setup.  I also have an extractor exhaust with single QP.  The
cam is an Engle 110.  This engine loves to rev, but I generally keep it under
5000 rpm unless I need &quot;emergency power&quot;.  I also got better gas mileage when
I went to the dual carb setup.  They really are not difficult to tune and keep
in sync.  The biggest improvement to performance for your dollar is a good
extractor exhaust system.  Even with a stock cam and carb, it will let your
engine breath a lot easier.   Some will say that you lose low end torque if
you do this.  That may be, but I haven't noticed.   I don't think I can ever
go back to a stock 1600 in my bus after driving my current engine.  Please
take your time and build your engine very carefully whatever combination you
decide on.  Start building in that good karma with the engine.  Good luck,
