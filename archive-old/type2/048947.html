Subject: [T2] second ' keeeerunchhh' gear.

Hello all....
Just a question to those with a bit of knowledge
on gear-shift problemmos....


My old '74  bay-window seems to find it difficult to select 2nd gear....
sometimes even 1st !
( 3rd , 4th and especially reverse, no worries here........)

I have found however, if I depress the clutch whilst in 3rd ,
and let it up really quickly , it causes a 'clunck' from the rear....
( yeah, I know I speeky not techno ..)
after it 'clunks' 2nd gear is obtainable with
a little wiggle-bo-jiggle.......

I'm guessing something is a miss right ?
Anyone help at all Please ???

Dan.....
