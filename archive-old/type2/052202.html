Subject: [T2] Fiberglass cleaner?

Does anyone know of any cleaner or chemical I can use on my fiberglass
camper van top to make it look white again. It is very dirty and nothing
seems to work. Also, how difficult is for a novice to attempt body panel
repair and such, such as replacement of rocker panel and general repair of
rusty spots.
Thanks,
Eric
