Subject: Re: [T2] Rusty tank:

FWIW, we carry the POR-15 line of products, and their fuel tank sealer is
outstanding (it will seal rust holes the size of a dime no problem). The
prep stuff you need is also environmentally friendly, so you can do it in
your driveway.   :-)

We include full instructions with the kits, but the key IMO is to use some
short sections of chain or a couple cups of gravel (cleaned) to wash around
INSIDE the tank during cleaning. This abrasive knocks the old rust loose
where you can flush it out, and have a smooth surface to etch and coat with
sealer.
