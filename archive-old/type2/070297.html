Subject: '62 single cab p/u FS-Dallas

This was advertised in the Dallas Morning News last week.  I called the guy
about it and he wanted $2000 for it.  Today he called me back.  He's
desperate to sell and would take $1200 for it.  Per his description, has a
1600DP, no rust, teal/white front, primer rear, original interior w/o door
panels (small tear in seat).  He works construction and can't handle the max
62mph speed - needs to go faster.

Call his pager at 214-814-0360

Dean
