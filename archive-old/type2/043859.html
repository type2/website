Hello Andy and all
That's why I put in the disclaimer that I hadn't looked under and so was 
unsure.  Still betcha there's a chunk o'dookie actin' like a check valve, 
either at the MC or in the line.

The flaw here is that the 68-70 master cylinder has seperate ports for
the front brakes. (look under the dor dave) and no tee in the front brake
system. Since he has eliminated the hose the problem will be the MC.


&quot;The question is, said Alice, whether words can mean so many things&quot;
