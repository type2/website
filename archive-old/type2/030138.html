&gt; Recently I had a courtesy car while my bug was in for repair (Van off the
&gt; road at the same time - just my luck) but it was interesting to compare the

&gt; can put loads of soundproofing in and get somewhere near here. A new Type 2
&gt; (yes we have them in the UK :-) ) seems to acieve this in camper trim. More
&gt; importanly though, the new car always seemed DRY inside. I don't mean either
&gt; the bug or bus has pools of water in but on a damp day they do seem damp
&gt; inside. 

My theory:

Bus and bug heaters use outisde air and run it through heat exchangers
that are continually being splashed with water.  If a few drops of water
per minute are splashed into the heat exchangers (and the exchangers
aren't the best-sealed things around) the interior gets humid.

Modern cars mostly recirculate interior air, and even the air taken in
from outside has to pass the air conditioner evaporator which has water
drains built into it to get rid of condensed water during A/C operation.

Some modern cars even operate the A/C along with the defroster to first
condense water out of the air and then to heat the dry air before applying
it to the windshield.
