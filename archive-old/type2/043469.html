Subject: Engine pull last night...info on my web page.

Hello,

I asked yesterday about information about pulling the engine from my '71 bus and much to my surprise there was none because it was so easy! Well, as I went along last night pulling my engine, I took pictures and this morning put them on my web site. You can view them _at_
