Subject: Re: [T2] re:Missing engine parts

I have a couple of large holes in the battery trays which is pretty common.
How badly do you think this affects cooling?  Everything else is properly
sealed.

&gt; It's just this simple - you should not be leaking cooling air anywhere.
&gt; Also the top of the engine where the fan draws cool clean air should not be
&gt; open to the bottom (hot) of the engine where dust and heat can be picked
&gt; up. That means the engine compartment needs to have good seals around all
&gt; the wires and cables and tubes - metal and cardboard. That means all of the
&gt; metal needs to be complete and tight. These are the most common faults
&gt; found on an previously neglected VW.
