Subject: Re: Air Conditioning, to keep, or not to keep?

Hi Shawn
I've been wondering about the whole remove the AC thing.  Since it's a 
camper, what about converting the compressor and condenser to a 120 VAC 
unit?  You wouldn't have AC when driving down the road, not an issue as 
far as I'm concerned, I much prefer 2-45 AC (2 windows, 45 MPH).  When 
you arrive at the campsite, you could plug in, flip the switch, and have 
AC whilst camping.

I'm sure I'm not the first person to think of this so there's probably 
good reason why the majority will say it won't work but I sure would 
like to hear it from them.

Hello Lists, I am trying to get things figured out on
my new '75 Riviera. It has the underdash air
conditioning unit, plus the condensor under the middle
belly. But everything attached to the motor is gone.
I was thinking of removing everything else except keep
the blowers under the dash to move air around in the
bus. What is your thoughts?
