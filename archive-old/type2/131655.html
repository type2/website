Subject: Re: [T2] AIRS help needed Bus Down!

&gt;From: Access Systems not sure if you got a response on these yet, these 
&gt;bolts are unique in the
&gt;bus, very short with a large flange head.   they are 13mm bolts.  if he
&gt;drove with em loose damage is likely, (ask me how I know?)

Yes he was driving with it like that, he thought that it was a sound coming 
from the heat exchangers. But as of yet he has not called back to say he 
needed the bolts. I offered to pull the ones out of mine and let him use 
those or atleast give him the exact specs on them.

What happened did you crack your flexplate?

Thanks,
