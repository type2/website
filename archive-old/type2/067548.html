Subject: Does this engine have 2 different case halfs?

I recently purchased a remanufactured long block for my '81 Vanagon.
The left case has the number CV 312208 stamped on it near the flywheel
cover, while the right case has the number V 001001 stamped into it on
the casting just behind the oil breather.

The two case halfs certainly _Look_ different.  Is it possible to build
an engine from two different cases?  Why would one engine have two 
different numbers like this.

TIA
