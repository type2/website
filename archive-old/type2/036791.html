Subject: 79 Shocks

     Thanks to those who gave some input on my shock question a couple of
weeks ago.  Added the KYB's on my 79 &amp; WOW,  what a difference.  Rides a lot
nicer.  Seems to not get blown around as much.  I will be getting tires in a
few days.  Will probably go with the Continental's.  Still not sure there.
Anyway, thanks again.
