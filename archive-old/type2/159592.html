Nope, the electronic points don't rely on the lobes.

I'm partial to the compufire myself.  I like the installation better 
than the Pertronix, but I think both will work fine.  That said, I doubt 
you'll get better mileage, however, I did get better starting and have 
never had to touch the thing.  Plus, my timing stays rock solid.  Either 
one's going to run you around 70 bux.

If you are going to do a big upgrade to your ignition, one thing I've 
been eyeing is the ignition portion of the MegaSquirt.  You can use a 
distributor to trigger the MegaSquirt and then the MegaSquirt will fire 
the coil.  This allows complete adjustment over your timing, dwell, and 
an insane amount of configurability.  Once I get my fuel really dialed 
in, I'm going to switch over to electronic ignition and start tweaking 
my ignition maps.
