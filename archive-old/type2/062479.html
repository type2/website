Subject: BBTA report (long)

Got back last night about 8:00pm from the 1327 mile round trip 
from St. Louis.  My '59 single cab ran flawlessly (although a 
bit slow - still has the original split case tranny).  Over the 
course of the whole trip I only used almost a half a quart of oil.
Only hassled by &quot;the man&quot; once.  He said my tail-lights were &quot;dim&quot; 
and wanted to make sure I was not drunk.

I was able to get re-aquainted with Jon Christensen and Sami Dakhlia.  
Jon brought along his son Tony, but I don't think he remembered me.  
I had the oldest transporter until Jon arrived.  Mine is an early 
'59 and his is a late '58.  He beat me by 2-3 months!

Sami &amp; Maria brought their daughter Julia.  I asked Maria if Julia 
was about 4 or 5 months old and was surprised to find out she was 8 
months.  Sami said she was born only a week or two after I saw them 
in December.  I thought Maria only looked about 6-7 months pregnant 
at the time.

Next I met David Schwarze in his '73 Safari hightop.  I had never 
seen this conversion intact before.  He decided to come at the last 
minute and arrived Saturday right before the caravan (which I did not 
go on).

I met Tom Forhan and his wife in their 4WD Westy.  Beautiful bus.  
I think this is the only Vanagon that could ever find itself a home 
in my driveway.

Next to arrive were James Brill &amp; Heather &quot;the Tofu Lady&quot; (from 
public access cable fame).  There were way too many parallels between 
Jim &amp; I.  His first bus was the same as mine.  We could probably pass 
for brothers if you squinted your eyes (although he has a much better 
hairline - ha-ha!).  We have similar jobs.  His girlfriend Heather 
looks very similar to my ex-girlfriend (who left me two years ago - 
but I am not bitter!).  They were both very nice.

Then I met Eric Burtis and his friend (forgot his name) who were 
travelling from NJ around the Great Lakes to BBTA.

Pete Sellers &amp; Rose were there in their Eurovan with the Thing in 
tow for the caravan.

Captain James Kirk &amp; his wife Kate were there in the &quot;Roger Bellow 
&amp; the Travelling Troubadours&quot;-mobile.  

After the awards ceremonies Jim, Heather, James, Kate &amp; I had a few 
beers around a make-shift campfire of citronella candles and 
mosquito coils.  Kate broke out her new 3/4 scale guitar and played 
a few tunes.  She is a good guitarist.  She was even kind enough to 
allow me to play it and &quot;bellow&quot; out a song myself.  Not exactly my 
key and I didn't have enough to drink to not feel self-conscious (I 
am not a great player or singer).

The next day we were going to go to Sami's and the get a late lunch.  
Sami was having trouble directing Pete on how to back up to get the 
Eurovan lined up with the tow hitch on the Thing, so I went over and 
picked up the front end of the Thing and Sami pulled it over and on 
the hitch.

Caravaned to Sami's with Sami &amp; David Schwarze.  They got a little 
ahead of me a few times, but I warned them I could only do between 
50-54mph.  We met Pete &amp; Rose, and Jim &amp; Heather there and walked 
down the street to the local pizza place (great food, slow service) 
and watched the freakshow.  We joked about what would happen if any 
of us showed up for work in vinyl pants and platform shoes.  I had 
to admit to Pete that I wouldn't know a Eurovan if it bit me on the 
ass.  He said it is the only VW bus that could pass me going uphill 
towing another car behind it with the windows rolled up and the air 
conditioner on.

It was great meeting the new people and seeing those I had met 
before again.  I hope our paths cross again.

Dave
