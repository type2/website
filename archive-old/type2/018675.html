&gt; I've searched the archives but have not found an answer to the following
&gt; question:
&gt; 
&gt; Can an '83 vanagon tranny be used in a late '70's loaf simply by swapping
&gt; the nose assembly on the tranny? The '83 tranny in question has the shifter
&gt; input on the *side* of the nose assembly of the tranny.
&gt; 
&gt; A couple of posts in the archive state 'stay away from the side shifting
&gt; vanagon trannies' (with regard to using in a loaf) - but can it be done by
&gt; swapping nose assemblies? (and perhaps bell housings?). The body of the
&gt; tranny sure looks the same as on my '77.
&gt; 
&gt; I'll bet one of the tranny re-builders on the list would know this right off
&gt; the top of their heads!
TBone:
Been there, tried that! The internal linkage in the nose cones functions
differently between the 2 and the slots in the rails are facing
differently. I think the cases might interchange if you'd care to remove
all the insides from the vanagon trans, replace the shift rails w/ the
76-79 rails and reassemble. To do this you'd need a few special tools
and about 6 hours (for me). If you're gonna take one that far apart
might as well SELL the functioning Vanagon trans and fix the loaf trans.
The Vanagon trans probably has more market value.
