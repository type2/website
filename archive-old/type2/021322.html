Subject: Trailer Hitch

Bummer.  I need to replace my muffler with something skinnier than the
fat round one I have on my '79 CA Westy...  The dirty li'l bastid sticks
out from the body of the bus and won't let me mount my beautiful new
hitch.

Suggestions?  Can I just go to joe muffler down the street?

I'd have to grind off a major weld on the hitch to maybe get it to
work.  Just can't do that...

Thankee!

Teri
