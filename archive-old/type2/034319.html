Volks,

Due to the fact that list administration frustrates me and I tend to be too
quick on the trigger, I am retiring myself (again!). I'll do better dealing
with the web server and list server than dealing with the &quot;human&quot; problems,
which require more tact than I have left in me.

Mr. David Schwarze has agreed to accept the second shift (second seven days
of the month) at least on a trial basis. David's list credentials go back
to 1994, I think, which makes him a wise old man as far as this medium
goes. I know he'll do a great job.

In case anybody doesn't know it, you can reach the list administrator on
duty at any time by sending mail to &lt;type2-admin_at_type2_dot_com&gt;. This is where
you should send mail about list server problems, not to the list itself.

Other administrivia:

--Y2K: To my knowledge we're not taking any special Y2K precautions beyond
downloading the subscriber lists, as we're all UNIX, none of our sw has a
date problem, and our BIOS is modern. If the backbone stays up we should
stay up too. If we go down, well, that would be a good time to adjust your
brakes or scrub some tinware. We'll let you know when we get it running
again, we always do.

--Okay I took the pumpkins down so quit sending me mail about it. =^ )
