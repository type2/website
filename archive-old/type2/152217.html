&gt; 1978 2.0L FI unit.  Going through the motions of swapping sparkplugs.
&gt; Following Muir's book.  Except that one hole/threads looks to be messed up
&gt; at the beginning.  I tried other plugs and they get a few turns down by
&gt; hand, and then stop.  Tried once with ratchet, but that really did not help.

they make a spark plug &quot;thread chaser&quot; that you can pick up for a couple
bucks at the local FLAPS, has worked for me most times

&gt; Do I have to take the head off and get it machined?

if you force it you will likely need to take the head off, what you have
to do with it after it is off will depend on how badly the threads are
bunged up

&gt; Also, do I need the anti-seize goop too to lube the threads?

I've tried most of the anti seize stuff and am not overly impressed by any
of them. the copper based ones seem marginally better,

good luck
Bob
