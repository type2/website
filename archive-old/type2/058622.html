Subject: Need someone to look at Bus
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

I have found a '71 bus in Apache Junction, AZ. The only problem is I'm in
Cincinnati, Oh. Is there anyone in the area of Apache Junction, AZ. who
could look at it for me and maybe save me some $$$$ and time. If there is
someone, please p-mail me or call me collect at (513)761-9300. If I end up
buying it, you'll get the golden bus award. Hopefully waiting to hear from
someone as I HATE being busless. Thanks a bunch- TBear
