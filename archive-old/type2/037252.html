&gt; One main reason for finally getting off center and
&gt; doing it is the type2 site &gt; and this list. 


hey there,
if youre looking for a pristine ride, i would
definitely recommend the west or south of you.   it is
a crap shoot i agree, sight unseen and all, but i
would say if you find one, see if they cant email you
some detailed pictures, and go ahead and ask if anyone
on the list lives nearby and would go check it out.  
everyone seems real nice and helpful so im sure it
wouldnt be a big deal, most of us would jump at a
chance to go check out a bus.   i know id be happy to,
of course theres not much to go look at out here in
nebraska but you get my drift.   a place to look
online would be of course the type 2 classifieds, vw
planet usually has quite a few for sale busses with
pictures as does the excite vehicle classifieds.  
good luck in your search and you never know when
theperfect one will find you:)
