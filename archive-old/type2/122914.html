Subject: ice on inside?

Ok so I learned a neat little trick where I put a large piece of cardboard
on the outside of my windshield when the van's parked, and then when I'm
ready to go, no scraping of ice ... from the outside at least.  Anyone else
get ice on the inside of the windshield? ... I suspect you must ... so does
anyone have any tricks to subdue that ice forming process?  Unfortunately
and obviously, garaging is not an option for me.

right then,
 - Ian
