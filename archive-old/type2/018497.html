ok....after hours of scrubbing, washing, cleaning, and changing a tire,
and sweating... I got the wheel to turn....
I just pushed and pulled until it gave.._dot_cause I figured it was just
rust...thats what the archives said...and thats what you guys all said a
few months ago...a month ago...whatever it was...
now whenever I move the bus it makes a rust on rust sort of sound....
I'm thinking take my brakes apart and clean them...and grease the
bearings and get new pads... is this right?  my manual never really said
anything on this...neither did the archives...
sorry for posting so much...but I finally got my bus home and there are
many things that I just realized...  should I do this??  How much do
parts generally cost?  Is it a hard job for a newbie with a Muir
manual??
or does Stella just need to get running and going...she's been sitting
for a few years...

How do I get the front &quot;VW&quot; emblem off??  it is loose aleady on the
top...but the bottom isnt....I want to sand it and re-paint it to make
it look pretty...hehe

the front drivers side blinker...just under the headlight... holds
water...about half full...I drained it today... it is cracked on the
top.... it could probably use a new seal too... anyone have one of these
for a 71?

Whats the best way to replace the pin in the engine lid? Whats the best
thing to use? mine rusted out.....so one side has no pin..

whenever I turn my blinkers on to go right it flickers rapidly and not
in a continuous pattern....but my left blinkers work just fine... is
this a fuse...or a wiring problem or what?? its not the bulbs...

ok....thats all for now.... thanks for reading this far!
realize I just got my bus home today and am still VERY excited....now
that its dark i can't do any work on  it so....
