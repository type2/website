Subject: VW emblem

Hi everybody,

I am tired of searching for a VW emblem to put on the nose of Hector (my
van) Does someones of you have a good tip or something for me to find one.

I don't want to buy a new on (50$ US a less...) Do you know where I can
have an used one. If you have something tell it to me. Hector is very sad
to be without is emblem...
