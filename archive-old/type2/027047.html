Subject: Re: [T2] Seat Belts

Tim,

I wanted to do the same thing in my '76.  This summer I got a pair of 
retractable front seatbelts out of a mid 80's vanagon from a wrecking yard 
for about $25 each.  They work great.  All I had to do was get a piece of 
right angle steel to mount the retracting mechanism on the floor.  I also 
had to add a few spacers under the part that goes above my shoulder as their 
is a 'lip' along the doorjam on my bus.

I'm very happy with how they look, feel and work.  Now I can reach the glove 
box without having to unbuckle.

Ted
