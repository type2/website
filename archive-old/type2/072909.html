&gt;Hi listees;
&gt;   Fellow list member Nikki Elko paid a visit to Mike Gensler in San
&gt;Antonio and me, west of SA and hit the road home to California yesterday
&gt;evening...unfortunately, she called this morning and said she hit a deer
&gt;on IH-10 west of Junction, Tx last night. Tore the spare off and busted
&gt;up the right side of the nose pretty good

drat! that was a nice little bus - should be repairable tho.

at least it was only a deer... in utah, on blm land, i have been driving 55
at night on winding mountain roads and encountered whole HERDS of cows.
YIKES!!!!

and if you ever have the opportunity to visit w/ nikki do so; she is a most
entertaining person!
