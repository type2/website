Subject: western pa repair

I have just moved to western pa and my 74 vw van (carb.) is not liking this 
cold weather -- anyone know anyone that would work on my van around Indiana, 
PA -- 50 miles or so east of Pittsburgh??????

It is acting sluggish when I try to get going in gear and as I upshift -- 
when I give it tons of gas it will get going...but not as well as before 
moving here

tj
