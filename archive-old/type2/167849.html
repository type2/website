Subject: Who does a good job rebuiling 2.0 L long block in the US

I'm located in Chicago/Milwaukee and in need of a rebuilt 2.0 L long block
engine. I'd prefer to get one with automatic adjusting valves (78-79
version). I can pay for high quality work (not interested in cheap salvaged
engines), but don't know who is doing good work. I'm guessing this will come
from California but if there is a good re-builder in the Midwest that would
provide some advantages.  Just to be clear, I can find lots of places
selling them, but what I need is first hand experience about which shops are
turning out good products.

In case someone wanted to know, this is for use in a 77 camper bus with fuel
injection and the stock California emissions system.
