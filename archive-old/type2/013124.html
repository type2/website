&gt;&gt; also look at the top of the push rod, a hyd push rod is solid, a solid
&gt;&gt; pushrod is &quot;usually&quot; two piece, but this is a less reliable method.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;
&gt;No, a solid pushrod is hollow aluminum about 1/2'' in diameter.
&gt;A hydraulic pushrod is hollow steel about 1/4'' in diameter.
&gt;Both are hollow to lube the rocker arms.

Actually it was sort of right the first time, a solid lifter pusrod is
indeed 2 piece, 3 actually, 5/16&quot; steel ends pushed into a roughly
1/2&quot; diameter aluminum rod.  Hydraulic lifter pushrods the ends
are welded on or swaged down and appear essentially 1 piece.
But as Karl mentions this isn't reliable as custom pushrods might
appear either way.  The original &quot;give&quot; tip is a pretty good clue, even
with well pumped lifters you can usually lean on the pushrod end
with a mongo big screwdriver there where it is knurled and feel
give on a couple.  If it gives it sure ain't solid.  You got to do it
on vaguely non opened valves as loaded the &quot;give&quot; is loaded but
not really at TDC, just pop a cover and lean on a few of them.
Looking down the pushrod for the spring like he says is definitive,
unless they are crappy non OEM non dissasembleable lifters
(they do exist.)
