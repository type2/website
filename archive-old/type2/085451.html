Subject: Suspension query


My bus still has the original shocks on it, and they've clapped out.
Checking out the front suspension I see everything there has aged.

I'd appreciate it if someone could look at the suspension pictures at the
bottom of this URL and tell me what they think of the condition of these
items; I'd like to replace them at the same time.
