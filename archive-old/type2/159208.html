Subject: &quot;Little Miss Sunshine&quot; miniposters at AMC

I saw the actual bus the other day, at a mechanic's shop on Hyperion ave 
here in Los Angeles. Nice, bright (looks like) $500.00 paint job on it. 
The mechanic there does a lot of movie cars which then get rented to the 
movies here in Hollywood.

It's a little banged-up looking, actually! Not complete, a few things 
missing here and there, but a &quot;Little Miss Sunshine&quot; license plate is on 
the front...

After that, I decided to buy another bus for fix-up and renting to the 
movies here.

And oh, I stole one of the flyers out of the bus just for later 
reference. (now, where the heck did I put that?)

Then, to top it off, today, (I'm a messenger as a day job and also a 
filmmaker by night and weekends), I actually picked up a PSP poster 
design for a print-house from the same company that created the Little 
Miss Sunshine movie poster, in Culver City. They were very nice people 
there, and gave me some cookies for waiting an extra ten minutes.
