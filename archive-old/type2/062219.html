Subject: Eureka Show

  I thot someone else might mention that besides being a great show,
Eureka,(Arkansas) had one feature that was a real hoot. An ENGINE BLOW! :O
They had that poor ol' engine up on a stand and were gonna kill it, right?
We all paid 1 $ for the priviledge if guessing how long it would last.
Well, Derick from Way out Salvage donated it and was the master engine
killer.  They had about 20 Gallons(US) of fuel up there and I figured it
would take about 6 minutes  12 seconds to kill that poor 'ol engine without
any oil in it and no air blowing on it either.  SO the master engine killer
got up there and after futzing with the starter a minute he wound that
poor 'ol engine up to max throttle and jumped back like it was a big
firecracker with a short fuse.  How long did it run?  About 2 seconds! 8\
It appears that that poor 'ol engine was the engine that could not.  :)
He goofed around with it for about 20 minutes, but that thing refused
to go.  Plenty of battery power.  I guess the carb was fouled.  So in the
end the prize went to someone who had guessed it would run for 6.35
seconds? %) Oh well.  It seems that ol' engine got the best of us as usual.
How long do you guys think it woulda lasted if they had killed it? 6m 12s?

Adios, Chris  '69,'71 Westys etc.
