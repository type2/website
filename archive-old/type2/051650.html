Subject: [T2] Re: [[VB] Westy Tent]

This won't help with a pole set for a Westfalia side tent, but...

One source of individual tent poles of various sizes and types is CAMPMOR.
Their online catalog is at:    www_dot_campmor_dot_com

Especially if you are rigging or modifying a non-Westfalia tent, or putting
together an awning or tarp setup, most of your needs are available at
CAMPMOR.  I'm not aware of any other outlet that sells individual bits and
pieces like they do, although companies like Coleman and Eureka can supply
individual parts for specific tent models they've sold.

FWIW.....

&gt;&gt;  I have a 1967 Westy. I would like to get a tent for the side. Does
anyone
sell the tent poles? I could always have the canvas made, but I at least
need the poles.  Does someone sell a complete kit?  &lt;&lt;
