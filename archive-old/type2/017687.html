&gt; About a month ago I put new wheel cylinders adn shoes on the rear of
&gt; my 70
&gt; Campmobile. Ever since then I feel this weird like &quot;shimmy&quot; I feels
&gt; like it
&gt; is from the rear.

On another vehicle I had this was caused by the handbrake being
overtightened
during a service - only came in around 70kph + and felt like it was
grabbing and letting
go rapidly.

&gt; am new to the wonderful world of VW.

Welcome!

&gt; PEACE :)
