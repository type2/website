Subject: [T2] that neighbor problem

I had a 33 ft motor home that I was parking in my driveway, it also was 
covering the sidewalk, in a covenent controlled sub division. Finally after 
3 mo. a neighbor a street above me complained to me cause she could see it 
from her back window. The end result was the police told me to just park on 
the sereet and told the neighbor to mind her own business. I sold it a few 
weeks later. No one has said anything about my buses being worked on and 
painted in my driveway. I guess my imediate neighbors are pretty nice 
people. Or they know me as someone who has a little bit of a problem with 
anger (control issues). I'm the only blue colar in the sub division and 
don't cause anyone any problem unless provoked. Anyways I have used full 
synthetic motor oil and gear oil in everything I and my wife drive, my 
buses, her BMW, my vintage racecar a 66TR4A, 1100Suzuki, 1949 Cessna. Never 
had a problem in winter or summer. I use 5w 50w (Mobil1) for the engine oil 
and the heaviest wt gear (Mobil1) I can find. The only thing on the negative 
side is the synthetic's ability to find a way out of the tiny leak places. 
It does make you keep up with proper gasketing everywhere. Here in Co. it 
can be 70 one day and 10 the next. I love the easy starts in very cold 
conditions. Cree 79 Bay BlueBlob
