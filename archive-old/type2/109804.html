Subject: Re: [T2] Torque

It was said:
&gt; I thought torque was related to bore size (Harley Davidson = large bore =
&gt; large torque.  Same for farm tractors)
&gt;
&gt; How come 2.0 has such a large increase in torque from a 1.8 with a small
&gt; increase in bore?? &gt;&gt;

By definition: Torque is determined by multiplying the applied force by
the distance from the pivot point to the point where the force is applied.

the pivot points in this case is the center of the crank main journal, to
the center of the rod journal.

which we call Stroke

So,, the more stroke you have the more torque you have.  if the applied
force stays constant.
