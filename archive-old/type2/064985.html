Subject: single front seat retrofit suggs?

WANTED: SINGLE FRONT SEAT UNIT OR SUGGESTIONS.
My '77 bus has terminal front seat upholstery crumble syndrome.  Everyone
with a '78 or older bus probably has had to deal with it.  I've
reupholstered those kind of seats before and swore I'd never do it again.
The Muir Idiot book recommends getting rid of the practical-yet-diseased
bucket style seats and retrofitting a single stretch seat.  The thought of
my imaginary sweetie sittin' up close appeals to me.  Assuming I can deal
with the gear shift (the real one) not getting in the way and willing to
release both seat runners to adjust back and forth positioning, (a real
drag) is it really feasable and if so, any suggestions/warnings?  I have
read the email communique regarding replacement foam inserts and will
pursue this as a last resort.
        My bus is a camper with the steel plate stiffener behind the
driver's seat.  Though this does not in itself complicate the issue, I'd
prefer the option to have the passenger side back be able to fold down as
additional lounge seating for the back area when camping.  I've seen seats
in cars that do this, but not lately nor for this specific application.
Also, seats must have whiplash guards, not like some of the older VW
stretch seats I've seen.
        Does anyone have a spare seat like this?  Has anyone gone through
the motions to try to do this before?  Is there a used car seat afterlife
warehouse anywhere?  Obviously I'm not looking for a VW product per se.
        Criteria: must be stretch seat w/ whip guards, can fit width-wise
in '77 bus and ideally (but not mandatory) 1/2 to 2/3rds of it fold down on
the passenger side.  Am prepared to weld, of course.
        Any comments or suggestions would be greatly appreciated.  Will
supply any measurements if requested.  My name is Ben Brigham.  Alright
yes, I'm a &quot;newbie.&quot; (groan)
