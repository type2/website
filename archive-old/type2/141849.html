Subject: Re: [T2] Sludge in gas tank

Ratwell discusses the process on his site, but here's the abbreviated 
version;

1. Take the tank out.

2. Put a length of chain into an otherwise dry tank and shake it

3. Hose out with water. Repeat until no more gunk and varnish come out.

4. Treat the inside with dilute acid (muriatic). Neutralize, then rinse 
out.

5. Treat with POR 15 tank sealer.

&gt; What is the best low cost solvent for dissolving this sludge? Carb

&gt; would be rather expensive to fill the tank with. The tank was filled 
&gt; with gas
&gt; about a week ago by the P.O. This didn't seem to loosen the sludge 
&gt; much.
&gt; Should I just fill it back up an be patient or is there something 
&gt; better than
&gt; gas for this?
