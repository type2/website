I find it sort of funny that someone comes to this list to complain like this. What good is it going to do? If you would have read throught the archives here or on the Samba you would have been able to avoid teh problem.

I do have empathy though. I paid a guy a lot of money to &quot;restore&quot; my bus about 5 years ago only to find that he did a hack job. As I look through teh Samba now I see other complaining about this guy. Everything I've read seems to suggest you'll get your order from Dawn though. 

Good luck and I feel your pain
