Subject: RE: [T2] Weber DFV 228 

&gt;&gt;I found a receipt and several pages of an instruction manual (in Spanish 
&gt;&gt;of course) for the dual carbs

Are you sure the manual was not in Portuguese??

&gt;&gt;  they looked like webers and appear to have been made in Brazil.

Portuguese??!?


&gt;&gt;  The receipt claims that they are Weber DFV 228's, but offers no other 
&gt;&gt;information

See http://ruralwillys.tripod_dot_com/mecanico/indicemecanico.htm  but run it 
through babel.altavista.
