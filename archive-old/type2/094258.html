Subject: Re: [T2] Brake conversion (emergency brake, vacuum ?s)

The emergency cable clearance is close between the cable and the booster.  I
can take a digipic and send it to you if you think that would help.

There is a hose that goes from the end of the booster up to the body to vent
the diaphragm.  I can also take a picture of that.

&gt; Hello all!
&gt; 
&gt; It's been some time since I posted here so I'll give a very brief rundown on
&gt; my setup... I have a 1970 that the PO pulled some weird tricks on so my
&gt; rehabilitation efforts have largely been trying to reverse (or complete) his
&gt; projects.  Right now I'm (finally!) finishing a front disc conversion.  The
&gt; PO had put discs on (actually a complete front end) but that's it - no
&gt; servo, no new master, no vacuum line, nada.  I've put the servo on, the
&gt; vacuum line, the regulator (make sure it's mounted parallel to line of
&gt; travel!), new filler etc. , but have run into two small problems that I
&gt; haven't been able to find a solution to in the archives.  The first is thus:
&gt; when the servo is installed I find that my emergency brake cable now rubs
&gt; against the top of the servo housing.  In a bus with discs is this cable
&gt; routed a different way?  Should I try to reroute it or just build a little
&gt; bracket to keep it off the servo?  I know it doesn't rub much so there's
&gt; very little concern for busting it...  My other question is about the rubber
&gt; boot on the end of the servo.  There appears to be another vacuum line
&gt; hookup there.  Is this opening just to vent the system? Or should it be
&gt; routed into the other line?
