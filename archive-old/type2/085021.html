	Got mine at www.gowesty_dot_com part# GVW-211-707 for 68-79 type II.
This =
	was a true bolt-in installation, with all necessary hardware
supplied. =
	Looks like NOS VW parts (mine is dated 1985) that have been modified
=
	with correct spacers, etc. The salesman said that they do a lot of =
	replacement belts for Porsches, which is another part of their
business. =
	Everything looks more than strong enough, and it only took 10
minutes to =
	install. At $110., it's not cheap.

According to the site that $110 EACH.  That's more than I paid for my Bus!
(Of course I've put a few more clams into getting it roadworthy.)  I got
seat belts for all 7 passengers at my Pick-n-Pull for less than $100.  And,
if you're worried about the strength of those old belts you can go down to
your local upholstery guy and get new straps sewn up onto your hardware and
still not pay $110 each.
