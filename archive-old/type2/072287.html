In the spirit of never assume anything, I went out to my bus, got out what I
believed to be the correct socket and popped off the rear hubcap to size it up
to insure it was the right one.  You need a 46mm or a 1 13/16&quot;.  I have a
Craftsman 1 13/16&quot;, which has served me well for over twenty years.  Don't get
the solid 3/4&quot; breaker bar with the sliding head from Craftsman - they bend.  I
guess that Craftsman doesn't understand that a 3/4&quot; breaker bar needs to be able
to handle the cheater bar that you slide over it (I use the handle from my
Craftsman floor jack that I bought at the same time as the socket).  The breaker
bar I do use is the 1/2&quot; drive pivot head, which looks a lot wimpier than the
3/4&quot;, but has survived many operations, and if it breaks, after I wipe myself
off the floor, since I would have been standing on the end of the cheater bar
when it broke, I'll go to Sears, get a free replacement and buy the 3/4&quot; version
at the same time.  The sliding head on the solid bars also is kind of clumsy.

Just my $.02,
good luck,
terry

&gt; Is the big fat rear wheel nut on my 1969 bus a 45mm?
&gt; Muir said it would be 36mm, and I happened to have one.
&gt; But, it's a lot bigger than that.  I measured it with the 
&gt; ruler on my leatherman super tool (the best tool I have ever
&gt; had).  So, it's 45mm?

I think it's 46mm. You're much more likely to find 1 13/16, which fits 
fine. But I'd be sort of surprised if they have it at Sears.

(Don't even *try* doing this with a 1/2&quot; drive).
