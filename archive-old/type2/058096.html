I might be bit out of date with this -digest etc.,

I use an illuminated toggle switch for a timing light, and 2 pieces of wire
with spade connectors, connect the light wire to the -ve on the coil (the one
with the green wire from the dizzy), plug the groung into the ground point
just inside the engine compartment on the left (the left hand light cluster is
also connected to it)
