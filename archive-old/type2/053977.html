&gt;BTDT, love the results.  The short answer is yes, it can be done.  The long
&gt;answer is that it's a bit of work.
&gt;
&gt;The driver's seat will slide right in.  The passenger seat requires that you
&gt;install the Vanagon seat tracks.  This is not as bad as it sounds.  What you
&gt;have to do is take your battery powered drill motor and drill out the spot
&gt;welds on the donor vanagon.  You also have to drill out the spot welds on the
&gt;bus seat hardware.  Put the seat tracks on the seat, position it (make sure
&gt;that you can close the door with the armrest on the seat!) and tack it down. 
&gt;Remove the seat and rosette weld where you have drilled and paint it up. 
&gt;Grease the track and slide the seat in.

 Or...in a similar manner you can also use the driver's side seat tracks
 from a donor bay window for the passenger's side new seat.
 You drill out the spot welds in the same manner as Jim has detailed
 above for a Vanagon.

 The only additional work as I recall is that you must also seperate
 from the slide tracks (by again drilling the spot welds)the &quot;toothed&quot; 
 thingy that holds the seat in position when slid forward or back to
 suit the driver's preference.
 When you detach all of this stuff you will find it will re-assemble &amp; weld
 back together in the mirror image of it's former self and you will have 
 identical style slide tracks on both sides.
 All you gotta do then of course is remove (or bend over) the lugs that
 formerly held the fixed passenger seat in position or they will foul
 the new seat &amp; slide tracks.
 
 I did this in my RHD '76 D/C to have sliders on the left seat for a pair
 of better seats mounted on VW runners.It became quite obvious when I
 looked into doing this that the various parts that make up the slide
 tracks for a bay window driver's side seat are the same pieces for LHD 
 or RHD vehicles - it just depends how you put them together.There's even
 depressions in the metal work on the passenger's side under the seat
 that plainly show where the slide tracks would go (if it was to have 
 been built for driving on the opposite side of the road)
 
 When you think about it,it makes sense that VW did it that way.
 Less pieces to manufacture,just put them together the opposite way.
 All part of the (dare I say it?) Deutche Methode....:)
