Subject: Re: [T2] Re: my bus has NOTHING to do with ScoobyDoo!!

Note also that the &quot;Mystery Machine&quot; in the photo is a Chevrolet 
Astrovan. That model postdates the Scooby Doo series by about thirty 
years.  My recollection of the original series is that the cartoon 
vehicle was modeled on a Corvan. Calling the pictured van the &quot;real&quot; 
Mystery Machine is like calling the Batmobile in Batman Forever the real 
Batmobile &lt;http://www.javelinamx_dot_com/Batmobile/batcar1.htm&gt; or like 
calling the &quot;Bullitt Edition&quot; Mustang 
&lt;http://www.motortrend_dot_com/roadtests/coupe/112_0108_bullitt/&gt; the real 
Bullitt Mustang. (Odd... can't find a link to the new Batmobile, the old 
Mustang or the old Mystery Machine.)

I guess you just have to be old. But Corvan would answer the question of 
American van styling and rear engine.
