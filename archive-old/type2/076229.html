Subject: Re: [T2] Alternator??  And Bus is running!!

 If you've got a '78, then you've got an alternator, not a generator. 
I just replaced the alternator on my '78.  Easy job, just takes a
little time.  Also helps to have the rear wheels up on ramp.  Both the
Bentley and the Compleat Idiot can get you through the process.  If
you've never done it, read the instructions and then let me know if you
have any questions.  As for test the alternator, first make sure the
belt is taut and not slipping, although I'm sure you would have it. 
Also, check to make sure the alternator is properly secured.  The
brackets for the alternator have a tendency to fail.  As for a new
alternator, you can't beat a new Bosch with the roadside assistance
guarantee, or Poorman's triple A.
