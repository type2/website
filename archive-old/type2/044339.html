Subject: [T2] re: rear deck lid

When the lid is closed, you generate some positive pressure in the 
engine compartment from the ramjet effect of the air scoops. I've never 
measured it directly (although it would be a fun little enginering 
project to do), but judging on how much more heater air I get at speed 
than when at rest, I think it is porbably enough to produce greater 
airflow over your cylinders. Opening the hatch would let that pressurized 
air blow uselessly  out the back. 

The mechanic's thesis, that there is a lack of cool air in the engine 
compartment and that opening the hatch lets more in, seems pretty dubious 
to me. 

I'd leave it closed. Free advice is worht every penny.
