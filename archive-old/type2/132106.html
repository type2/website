Subject: Endplay shims founds

Well I located the shims I needed. For the local folks here's a heads up for
future reference to save yourself some time:

Bugformance - told me to call their machine shop. The shop invited me to
look through some of their boxes in my own time.

Volks Authority - Type I only (expected it but worthy a try anyway)

Peninsula - said they had some but never called back

Greg's VW - Don9t carry them

Donsco - made jokes the entire time they tried to pawn off the wrong shims
on me. I wasn't amused.

BusLab - said they could have them via Worldpac by 2pm (they were my backup
as they were too far away to drive)

Parts Haven - didn't have any

Called three Porsche dealerships. Only one offered to get them for me the
same day if I paid $1 more per shim (Carlson in Redwood City).

High Performance House - always have genuine shims in stock for their 914
work. Sold me some and put in an order the replace the ones I bought right
away. Awesome!
