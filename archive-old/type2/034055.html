Subject: Sisypus Rocks!  '73 bus for sale... needs heads :-(

Volks,

I just got the bad news...  the '73 has a loose valve seat :-(  Not a
particularly difficult job, flopping heads; but it will cost, it will
take time, and in winter it will take a garage.  I find myself with three 
project on my hands and tat's too many. I am officially &quot;giving
up&quot;.  

The minuses:

The body on this bus is ragged, at best, a DPO mooshed the nose, and
while it has a new nose skin, they did not straighten the passenger's &quot;A&quot;
pillar, so that door needs slamming,
usual rocker rust,
ball joints need work (are shot), 
the trans is a '79 and the shifting has always been a bit dodgy,
needs heads.

the pluses:

the engine is an '80 block... 2L with hydraulic valves and recent P&amp;C's
'78 FI installed and working fine,
the interior is pretty good and quite complete,  
the front seats were re-upholstered two years ago, and have the headrests,
it has (thanks to Karl) the correct upper cot and
the pop-top canvas is good (OK, it is a blue and white stripe, but intact
and &lt;10 years old),
brakes are fairly new, 
front axle beam is solid, 

If I were buying, not selling, I would say this is an excellent parter, or
a fair resto candidate.  If you have a pair of heads and a place to work
on it it would make a fine &quot;winter beater&quot;.  I am just over-committed
between the '67, the '73 and the '80 and recently lost my dry work area
:-(  something has to give, and I fear the '73 is it.

Make me an offer...  I have no real idea what it is worth.  I will be
taking a bunch of pics and posting them soon.
