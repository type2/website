Subject: [T2] Trip Report &amp; carburetor woes

'72 Westy Roconante has held up well on the 5,000 mile round trip from East
Texas to California and back in November.  The December trip is to Mexico
City and back.  This is a yearly outing every November and December.

The single Webber carburetor setup has worked well for years, the
carburetor itself was replaced about 10K miles back after the first Webber
had lasted almost 200K miles.

North of Mexico City is where we are now and the 7,000 foot altitude here
seems to be effecting the preformance worse than it ever did before:
running extremely rich and with practically no power at all.  This
afternoon while cruising along at 60mph for a half hour, the engine
stumbled for three seconds and suddenly quit as surely as someone had
turned off the key.  The passenger-side spark plugs were wet with gas and
all four were obviously running rich.  After following the flooded engine
procedure, she started up with a cloud of black smoke.

After spending some time in the archives, I have decided that changing the
timing from the recomended specs is not a good idea.

In the morning I am going to try the John Muir recomendation for
deactivating the choke to see if that helps.  If not, you will hear from me
again.  Suggestions are always appreciated.
