Subject: Re: [T2] fuel leak - and tossing used parts

[...]
If it appears that even might be rebuildable i  keep it.  i.e. the 
brake master cylinder  i just pulled out.  4 starters  for type ones  
on the shelf, a few  carbs in a bucket, and  a couple wiper motors. 
somebody came  and got my bucket full of bug wheel cylinders  i had 
collected over the years.

&gt; For those of you with apparently re buildable fuel pumps and carbs -

&gt; offer them to the list. I try to stock pile a few of these spares as 
&gt; while they may be plentiful now - they may be hard to get in ten years 
&gt; and more cost effective to rebuild.
