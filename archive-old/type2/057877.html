Subject: Busses By the Arch next weekend...
Content-Disposition: inline

Hi all,

Well, it's that time of year again!  This coming weekend, Sept 4-7th, 
&quot;Busses By the Arch #14&quot; will be held rain or shine at Cherokee Lakes 
and Campground in O'Fallon, Missouri (a western suburb of St. Louis 
and about 35 miles from the Gateway Arch).  The requests for event 
flyers and directions have kept me very busy while getting ready, 
so I expect that we'll probably see about 120-150  Busses and other 
types of VW's in attendance throughout the Labor Day weekend.  At 
this NEATO &amp; LiMBO family VW camping event you'll see Transporters 
of all types and era's from all over the U.S.A.  Fellow Bus owner 
Herry Z. DeKuyper, Editor of &quot;VW Trends&quot; magazine, will be here to 
cover the event and hunt down some Midwest &quot;feature&quot; Busses.

It's almost too late to send a last minute flyer by pmail, so what follows 
are general directions to the BBTA #14 event site:

Cherokee Lakes and Campground is located on Highway 79 about 
7.5 miles northwest of Interstate 70, and is in the City of O'Fallon, 
Missouri.  As you head northwest on Hwy 79 the campground will be 
on the right side (watch for event signs) and is tucked behind a gas 
station / conveinence store.  Do not go to down to the &quot;Arch&quot; looking 
for a field full of Busses!  We'll all be 35 miles away enjoying ourselves.
 

Reservations CANNOT be made in advance, electrical outlets are 
limited and all sites are &quot;first come - first served&quot;.  Remember, to 
park inside the event camping area you MUST be a event participant 
and you MUST be in a VW.  Parking for visitors (and other makes 
of cars) will be nearby at the campground office parking lot.  There 
is an BBTA event fee of $10 for the whole weekend, and in addition, 
the campground charges $10 per night per vehicle for camping (there 
is a discount if you are bringing more than one of YOUR OWN Busses). 

We're looking forward to seeing all of the regular BBTA crowd along 
with many new faces this coming holiday weekend.  In addition to all 
the site to site visiting, there will be an informal Bus show, many cool 
(and a few wierd) door prizes, a huge VW caravan / picnic on 
Saturday, and on Sat. evening immediately after the awards 
presentation, two D.B.G. Club members will hold a wedding (all 
participants are invited) in their D.B.G. tavern / chapel.  I'm told they 
may be bringing a band to play in their &quot;tavern&quot;.  I gotta see all this!!!

Anyway, I'll get back to my preparations, so please drive carefully, 
caravan if you can and we'll look forward to seeing you around the 
campfire this weekend!

P.S.   Could someone / anyone please forward this over to the 
           Vanagon List for me? Thanks!
