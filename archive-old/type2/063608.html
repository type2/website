Subject: that repair engine book?

There have been a fair number of notes re the engine repair book.  Would 
that book cover the Type IV engine.. the pancake?  I just retreived the 
wayward engine of the 72 westy that I bought last week and I have to 
admit I'm confounded by all the wires that are on it as well as the wires 
that are missing.  It sounds like that book could be the one for me.

I have a billion other questions... here's one more.  Would a 73 
Westy motor fit in my 72 westy?

Please and thank you in advance...
