Subject: Spark plugs

Hey folks, Is there any advantage to buying the more expensive (Bosch)
platinum spark plugs?  I can imagine that they are more durable but wasn9t
sure if they might be worth the extra dough?
Also, has anyone had a plug blow out (physically ejected) from the socket?
Just wondering if its common and what damage might occur.  All seems well,
but a little scary.  Thanks.

-See you on the road, Nik
