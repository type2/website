Subject: Re: [T2] '72-'74 exhaust on a '77

Patrick:
Duh? Bus boys doesn't know it the engines are the same width?
I assure you, they are. (I've got one on my 80 Vanagon.)
This is really a situation where you need to search the archives. There are
several parts you need to change, the ducts going into and out of the heater
boxes, the alternator bracket, the corresponding hanger for the left side, the
lower front engine tin on both sides and the underside tin on both sides. I
recall a good post from Karl (aufever) listing all the parts. I'd try to get
them used from a list vendor.

&gt; After ~3 years of dealing with the custom fabricated system from the PO, I'm
&gt; going to re-do my exhaust system from head to tail pipe.  Knowing that the
&gt; '77 era system is NLA, I wanted to go with the '72-74 heater boxes &amp;
&gt; muffler. I've searched around the archvies but have only read of this as a
&gt; easy bolt-up alternative from Ron at BusDepot.  In speaking with another
&gt; vendor yesterday (Bus-Boys), they couldn't confirm that it'd work. The
&gt; concern they had was that if the 2.0l in my '77 was wider/narrower than the
&gt; 1700/1800 in '72-'74, the muffler wouldn't line up with the heater boxes.
&gt; They didn't say it wouldn't work, they just didn't want to sell me something
&gt; that they weren't sure would work.
&gt;
&gt; I would very much appreciate any feedback from anybody who has done this
&gt; installation- does it bolt right up, are there suggestions, advice, etc.?
&gt;
&gt; I'd also appreciate any feedback (pmail if appropriate) on the quality of
&gt; the materials and timeliness of goods received from the various list
&gt; vendors.
&gt;
&gt; I have access to a heated garage for a narrow (week) period in late December
&gt; and I can't risk it not arriving by then.
&gt;
&gt; Thanks kindly
