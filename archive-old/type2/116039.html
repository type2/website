Subject: Re: [T2] spark

&gt; The car is still running kinda off.  It has a continuous bah, bah, sound
&gt; from the exhaust kind of like a rythmic small backfire.  I checked the coil
&gt; and it has a strong yellow spark.  i put another coil in and the same strong
&gt; yellow spark.  I am pretty sure the second coil is brand new..... is there
&gt; another reason why the spark isn't bright blue besides a bad coil?
&gt; 
&gt; The bus now is still hesitating at high rpms. and it isn't running as smooth
&gt; as it should...
&gt; 
&gt; Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated
&gt;
My first thought would be check your mix settings on your carb, but I never
had that much of a drop from that type of problem.  I think you should
recheck the timing, keep checking for vacuum leaks &amp; possibly check your
valve settings (that is unless you stated having hydraulic valves).
Cheers
