Subject: Installing VDO oil pressure sender on Type 4 engine?

------_=_NextPart_001_01C11B5F.8C228480
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

Hi all
I am completing the re-assembly of my type 4 engine (73 Bus) and bought a
VDO oil pressure sender and guage for it.
The kit comes with a sender that screws into the place where the original
sender goes, a tubing that connects the sender to the guage which is mounted
in the dash.  My problem is the following: the tinware hole above the oil
pressure sender hole is too small to accomodate the VDO sender.  How do
people resolve this problem?
1. enlarge the tinware hole?
2. install some kind of pipe fitting extension in the oil pressure sender
hole to that the sender sits above the tinware?
I was thinking of doing something along the lines of option 2, but will
welcome any suggestion of how to best do this.  Thanks!
  --Robert
