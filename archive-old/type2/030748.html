Subject: Machined intake manifold?
In-Reply-To: &lt;36C0445B.B07C3E22_at_intop_dot_net&gt;
Message-ID: &lt;Pine.GSO.4.02A.9902090808370.10162-100000_at_user2.teleport_dot_com&gt;


Skutter's got a nasty vacuum leak. I tried to fix it by replacing the
cracked intake manifold boots. This actually made it worse, because I
didn't get new gaskets. I asked, they didn't know what I was talking
about. And then I broke a rusty stud on the muffler when I was trying to
put her back together.

Sie's sitting in the driveway waiting for her gaskets to arrive from Bus
Depot. In the mean time, I dropped in on the local VW shop, just to get
acquainted. I told him what had happened. He told me that any time you
take the intake manifold off, you should have it machined. 

So, I have the parts on order from Bus Depot. (Hi Ron! Gonna be here soon,
right? :&gt;) but I'm woondering, should I go ahead and have them mahine the
intake manifold, or not?

I've finally decided that I will recover the  driver's seat in leather,
the other seats, I think I will do in an overstuffed Victorian floral
motif. Sie doesn't have any interior panels, I was thinking about trying
to salvage some, and use them for a pattern to cut the birch paneling. I
don't think this one came with birch panels to begin with, but would
that work? Or is there somewhere I can get new internal panels for a
reasonable price? I don't feel the need to keep her stock for now, I'm
just trying to make her presentable.
