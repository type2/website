        I'm a firm believer in a good coat of RTV silicone gasket goo on
both sides of the gasket, and it even works a second time - usually.
        Other people seem to have a fear of RTV breaking loose and
getting in an oil passage or something -- I've never seen that happen,
but then I don't get excessive with it either.
