&gt;&gt;Does anyone know of a good wheel bearing grease that resists flow due to
&gt;&gt;the combined effects of heat and centrifugal force?
&gt;
&gt;Using my fav...Valvoline Moly grease, I would,

Steve makes a lot of good points but something to recall is that it is a
bad idea to mix moly and ole fashion grease.  So if you want to go for
the moly (I like the Valv semi-synthetic which I use in CV's) you got to
clean everything out with solvent which can be a royal PITA.  I tend
to use the cheapo coastal or Unilube &quot;high temp wheel bearing&quot; grease
for $2.50 the tub and never have more than a hair seeping from the center
caps, certainly none past the seals, UNLESS it is a vanagon with new
rotors (ie integral hubs) and then the caps never seem to fit tight enough.
I will then proceed to lay a thin film of silicone on the edge when I install
the cap to avoid the ugly look.

I don't know why I don't use moly in the fronts I know it says you can
and all and I use it everywhere else but I just can't get used to it for
wheel bearings.  FWIW Valv and Mobil also have some semi synthetic
non moly for the purpose, usually in weird colors that have a higher NLGI
rating, something, something 2 instead of 1 I don't recall you can compare
on the tubes.  They seem to stay more solid at higher temps.  Of course
a front wheel bearing should never get very hot so the root of the problem
may be too loose adjustment or dragging brakes or something of the like.
Feel up the hubs after a long interstate drive with no braking except when
you get off the ramp, pull over jump out and see if them or the wheels are
warm.
