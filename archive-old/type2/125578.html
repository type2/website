Subject: Re: [T2] Re: Distrutor Drive alignment

Ok, the archive (http://www.type2_dot_com/archive/type2/013935.html) mentions a special tool to get the drive gear out. Is this tool something that can be fabricated, or does it need to be bought? Think it's NEEDED or just nice to have? And the drive gear just lays down inside of their eh? No screws or clips or nothin'? Think maybe a strong magnet could pull it up? 

Chris

P.S. in the archive, is their anyway to do quoted text? Like for &quot;Distributor Drive Gear&quot; that it looks for the whole string, instead of looking for the 3 different words?


&gt;  Ahh, wrong, the gear on the bottom of the distributor
&gt; must be left alone, the big gear below the distributor
&gt; is the one that is being talked about, it must be
&gt; pulled out and positioned at the correct angle with
&gt; the engine at #1 TDC, don't be pulling that little
&gt; gear off the bottom of the distributor... Phil
