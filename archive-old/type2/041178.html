Tim
you are about to be bombarded with tool lists all known to thier author (and
held with religious fervour) to be absolutely definitive. Ask me how I know.
Muirs book has a list of 3 tool lists defined by the type of job you are
prepared to do on the road. I liked that as a starting point.

 Well, does anyone have
&gt; a list of all of the tools that you should have if you
&gt; own a VW Bus?  Also, if anyone out there has a bus for
&gt; sale in the MD area, please let me know.  I got a lot
&gt; of responses on that the last time.  Thanks a lot.  I
&gt; really appreciate it.
&gt;
&gt; Peace,
