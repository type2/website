Les, very nice looking bus. I have a couple questions. First where did you
find the rear Safari window for the Bays. Second what are the front seats
out of? They look very comfy. I saw that they are custom so I assume you had
to modify the seat tracks? Does the passenger side still swivel?

Thanks and good luck on the sale. I dont think you'll have a problem at that
price.
