Subject: Australian campers (tents and awnings)

I know theres not many 'Aussies' on the list but hopefully one of them has
an answer for me. I Have a 75 Camper with a Sopru conversion but am missing
the tent or awning that attaches to it.  I can't seem to find one so was
hopeing someone would have some pictures or know of a place that has them (I
doubt it).  It attaches via a marine fitting along the poptop and has
press-studs on the van in front of the sliding door and right at the back in
front of the air intake.

If I can't find one I'll make an awning but some pictures of exactly how it
attaches would be good :)

Cheers
