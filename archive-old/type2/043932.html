Hi all,

I put the valve train together today and for kicks I thought I would 
check out TDC and the positioning of my distributor.  So I put the #1
piston right up to the top of it's travel and I noticed that the 
rotor tip wasn't in the middle of the dizzy mark.  It was slightly 
before.  With out twisting the distributor at all I took it out of the
case and to my surprise the offset groove wasn't at a 90 deg. angle to
the case seam.  It was pointing right at the rear (RIR) case bolt on the
top.  In order to get the offset parallel to the rear of the engine I
had to move the flywheel BACK apprx. 15 deg.  Judging from the timing 
marks on the pulley. (stock)

I thought that I had followed Wilson to the letter.  Now, after re-
reading Wilson I'm confused.  He says that 3 points must be aligned:
the dizzy drive shaft slot,  the line stamped on the dizzy,  and the 
rotor.
You place the offset in the correct position, then put the dizzy on
(apparently the dizzy shaft will ONLY fit one way so it's hard to screw
this part up),  Then twist the dizzy so that the mark on the housing
is right in the middle of the rotor tip.  So far, so good. 

But Wilson's description of how the distributor is supposed to look is 
not how mine looks.  He says the rotor points to five o'clock.  Mine 
points to about 2 o'clock.  He says the vac advance can points to the 
left rear.  The 'cone' on mine points to about 5 o'clock.(right rear).

So, have I done anything wrong?  

Does the rotor tip and the housing mark in the dizzy and TDC for the #1
cylinder all have to be occuring at the same time?  Because right now
mine doesn't if the 3 areas listed above are aligned.  

Thanks for bearing with me on this.  It's hard to explain.
