&gt; Any physicist out there who could estimate how much additional load can be

&gt; you get on a scale.
Sami:
I'm sure it is. Static load figures on tires are probably in the
neighborhood of 10X working loads and load at failure is probably 20x  
or thereabouts. Sorry, I'm no scientist, just a practical engineer (pe).
My references for these ranges is on the label of the roll of chain at
the farm store.
Actually, this is precisely within the realm of the physics teacher:
are any out there for our weekly lesson?
