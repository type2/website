Keri,

Yes,

The rod with the two wholes is for the 69 or
upright oil cooler set up. That is the rod is
strait and
slides directly onto the flapper boxes lever arms.
Your 71 has an offset or dog house oil cooler
which
requires the rod to jog around the oil cooler.
This rod as you stated has only on whole on each
end and
requires the us of an adapter. These adaptors can
be seen on our site under &lt;Engine&gt; then &lt;Cooling
Air Controls&gt;
They are item number 28. We have several of these
and can add them to our on-line catalog.

Subject: [T2] air control flaps question



Hi, I know there was talk about the air control
flaps about a week or two
ago.  I'm going to install them on my engine this
summer.  I have a couple
questions I'm hoping some of you might know.  I
have a '71 dp engine, I
just received my connecting rod (rod that opens
the flaps), but took flaps
of of a single port '69 (I believe) engine.  The
single port engine
connecting rod has 4 holes ( 2 on each end) to
open the flaps.  The 'new'
rod I got for my '71 dp engine only has 1 hole on
each end.  What I'm
wondering is: can I make those '69 flaps work, or
do I have to buy new
flaps that fit a '71 engine?

thanks in advance,
Keri
