72-78 will work with minor modifications (might have to flycut the earlier heads to fit over 2L barrels).

&gt;I have the opportunity to buy a set of &quot;D&quot; port heads for a good price but
&gt;wanted to know if they would work or not.

D-port?  Do you mean rectangular port heads?  If so, they will not work, at least not very well.
