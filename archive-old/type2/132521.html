Subject: Re: [T2] VIN swap (was Jay Leno)

There ought to be a grandfather clause. Owners as of the day the law 
goes into effect would be grandfathered (just like Prop 13), but the 
exemption vanishes with sale of the bus.

Clearly, they are attempting to get as many old cars off the road as 
possible. Collectors' cars are a small percentage of these.
