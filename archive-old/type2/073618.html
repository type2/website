Subject: Re: [T2] Re: DP to SP conversion

This tale will spin you out....
The TP 1600 engine I scored to put in my 72 single cab
is from a 76 Microbus specially ordered by the
Australian Army apparently long after to could buy a
1600 in anything but a single cab.....I may be wrong
here.
It is an upright engine &amp; the bus it came from had no
over head hatch,instead a pressed steel panel with
double the standard supports underneath.
As well the bus had a rail welded UNDER the engine so
the only way to work on it was to remove the entire
engine &amp; gearbox.
Apparantly it was supposed to be able to take a hit
from behind &amp; keep running.....??????
The guy who bought it from the government auctions had
a block &amp; tackle set up in his garage so he could
hoist the rear end by the bumper just to do things
like change the spark plugs.
Go figure?
:-)

&gt; &gt; In the USA, 71 buses were the last of the upright
&gt; 1600's. 
&gt; &gt; They were SP.....
&gt; 
&gt; Au contraire, they were DP - at least my old 71
&gt; clipper was.  I thought
&gt; they all were.
&gt; 
&gt; FWIW, my current 71 westy has a rebuilt 1600 SP in
&gt; it, but it's not
&gt; original.
