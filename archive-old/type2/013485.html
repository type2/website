Subject: Looking for a bus owner and a few Carb questions
To: type2_at_type2_dot_com

Hello List,

I know that this is pushing the bus content limits but
I will try. I am wondering if there is any one out
there that lives in or near Wilmington, NC, has a
restored green and white vw van that is for sale, and
has a cousin named Brandi. Yes I know that is a strech
but Brandi, the girl that I am seeing says that her
cousin had a vw van for sale. I know that I left out a
bunch of details but I thought I would see if he or
she was on the type 2 list. That is all she told me.

I also have a carburator question.

I have 2 choices on carburators in my 74 automatic vw
bus. I have the dual solex 32/34 pdsit carburators
wich need rebuilding and linkage and hoses or a single
32/36 deav weber carb wich I rebuilt myself. the
problem (I think) with the Weber is it runs way too
rich and i have yet to make it run any leaner. It will
run on the engine but the plugs soon foul out.
adjusting the mixture screw dosn't help.  Also, when
the idle screw is backed all the way out, the enging
starts at a good low idle but gets faster and faster
in a matter of 10-15 seconds or so. That is with the
throttle linkage loose too. the only thing that I can
think of is to change the jets but i don't even know
what size jets are in it.

If both sets were rebuilt, and complete, which carb
set uwould be best for my 74 1700 automatic?

Any help would be appreciated.

Thank you,
David Kelly from Wilmington, North Carolina
