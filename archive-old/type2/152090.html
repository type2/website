&gt; I have a 78 transporter for sale $500.  It in fair contidion, but has
&gt; no motor.  there is an auto trans complete with new pressure plate
&gt; (missing push rod), and it has factory AC.  the H style unit over the
&gt; front part of the cab.  the interior is rough, well lets face it ..
&gt; the whole van is rough, but its all there.

someone buy this van, the body is too solid to be scrapped.

BTW. the oil pump shaft is missing on the tranny but this is common when
towed without an engine,  and easily replaceable
