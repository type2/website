&gt; Do I need to purchase a tank and then fill it? Where might I get one? I saw
&gt; one at Harbor Freight, but the tank was $79! And that was still empty!

Find your local gas supplier.
They will list their options for own/rent and refill/exchange.
And find an alternate supplier who will swap/refill their tanks.
Generally, you purchase small tanks and rent the big ones.
You will trade off convenience and price. Small tanks are portable,
large tanks are cheaper on refill per cu.ft.

&gt; Lastly, what type of wire would I need to change to since it seems that
&gt; flux-core is supposed to provide the same benefit of welding with gas?

Refer to the mig machine manufacturer instructions.
Local welding material suppliers can help with that too.

&gt; I'll have to stop at Harbor Freight again and see what else they have - but
&gt; any suggestions would be helpful.

Don't buy any tank made in China.
Check the inspection date stamped on the tank, especially if you swap refills.
