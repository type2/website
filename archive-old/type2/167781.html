Subject: distributors

	My mechanic says the dizzie ( 211 905 205S , originally '71 
beetle) on my '73 1600 DP lacks vac retard on account the vac can (on 
the side) has a hole in the diaphragm, detected {if not caused} by 
his slapping a strong vacuum onto it and finding this didn't affect 
spark timing.
	My carb is a Brazilian Weber.  The big vac nozzle on the 
intake horn (just inside i.e below the flange) is blanked off with a 
readily removable blind rubber tube.  I think this vac nozzle may 
have been originally connected to a dizzie with 2 rubber tubes from 
the induction tract to control dizzie timing.  There is now only the 
one low-vac tube to the dizzie, from the carb.  I haven't been able 
to see how it works (being used to hi-vac lines to dizzie from just 
inside throttle butterfly, on Solex etc) .
	He claims this bug dizzie does have mechanical advance.
	He also offers to replace the dizzie with a new 009 which he 
claims is a v good dizzie.  I on the other hand have somehow gained 
the impression on T2 List  -  correct me if I've misread the signals 
-  that the 009 is feared &amp; loathed.  Furthermore, the 009 he can get 
me for U$100 is made in a certain large Asiatic industrial power.  It 
might even have lead paint on the outside  :-}

	What do youse dizzie experts reckon?
