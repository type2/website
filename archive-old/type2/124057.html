&gt; The large bolt and washers that thread onto the end of the crank will
serve
&gt; as your &quot;press&quot; to get the hub back on; a flywheel lock is real convenient
&gt; here so you can get the correct torque on that bolt without the crank
&gt; spinning on you.

&gt;
&gt; Any ideas on how to do it with a Flex Plate for an Automatic? Is it
possible
&gt; to get the torque without seating the hub all the way? I am about to do
this
&gt; myself. I guess I could pull the flex plate off and install a flywheel
since
&gt; I am going to put in a new seal anyway.

I've had no experience with engines attached to automatic transmissions so
I'm not sure quite how you attack this.  I know that you'll turn the engine
over before reaching proper torque so you've got to keep that from happening
somehow.  I know before I got a flywheel lock my &quot;tool&quot; for this purpose was
my wife holding onto the flywheel as hard as she could, with gloves.
