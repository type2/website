Subject: Can this Carburetor be Saved?
To: type2_at_type2_dot_com

The 71 I just acquired had a bunch of tape around the carburetor (Solex 34 
pict 3). Naturally, I took the tape off to see why it was there. Bingo, this 
round piece about the size of a dime came falling off the carburetor! I don't 
think this piece has a name, but if you look at the carb from the rear of the 
bus, it is right in the center above the bolt that attaches the carb to the 
manifold. It looks like it is not supposed to be removeable. So, is there any 
safe way to reattach this, or do I need a new carb? Also, if I need a new 
one, would I be better off w/a reconditioned Solex than a Bocar? Thanks all.
