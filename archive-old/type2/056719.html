Subject: Re: UFO's in distributor

 Check all the usual
&gt;suspect wires, everything where it should be. Hmmmmm. Pull of the
&gt;distributor cap, and, whadda ya know, tiny little parts floating around 
in
&gt;there! I fished out what seems to be a tiny bullet, about 3/8&quot; long by 
1/8&quot;
&gt;in diameter. Looks JUST like a little bullet, even feels like lead or
&gt;another soft kind of metal. Along with it, but not attached to it, was 
a
&gt;little spring, kind of like a ball point pen spring, but not as long. 

Oooh, ooooh, pick me pick me!  I know!

You have not lost part of your distributor, but rather part of your 
distributor cap!  Cheap to fix :-) -- Pop the cap off, and check out the 
center post from the inside.  That spring and bullet are supposed to fit 
into the hole that is now there.  The bullet contacts the rotor and 
sends the electrical power that is to be your spark thru the rotor, 
where the rotor sends it to the appropriate spark plug.  So either pop 
the bullet and spring back in the hole or be a big shot and spring for a 
new distributor cap.  Get a new rotor while you're at it :-) -- Bosch 
please :-)
