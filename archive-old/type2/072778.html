List-
My friday question:
I am single and have 2 Busses and a H*nda A**ord. My insurance company
gives a discount on the second car but no more after that. I can only drive
one at a time. Does anyone know of a company that will insure me as a
driver and not charge over and over for each car added on?  As you all know
2 Busses is not enough.
BTW the H*nda died up state (middle of nowhere) late Monday night and left
me stranded. As it sputtered to a stop I could only think &quot;I wish I had the
Bus!!&quot;.
Thanks,
John Ingram
