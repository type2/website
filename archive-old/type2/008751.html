It is friday, or at least friday late.
I am having to answer this question about oil again, I have posted this 
before I think.
I use recycled oil only. Yep thats right my busses get recycled oil. I 
dont care what brand as long as it is recycled. Is this a good idea? 
Yep. I am completing the loop of returning oil, having it cleaned, and 
returning it to my bus. Why? It isn't expensive, additives are put back 
into the oil the same as any other oil, (look for starburst symbol and 
API rating), and it works just as well as anything else. My bus runs 
cool as always, and with frequent oil changes, the best thing you can do 
for your bus, its ecenomical. 
I have amazing longevity on all my engines, and I challenge you all to 
think about doing the same. Where exactly is all that oil you are 
returning going?
