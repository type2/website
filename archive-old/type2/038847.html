Before spending either of those amounts for either the rebuild or the new
engine...go see Sloan Bush at M&amp;D Imports on Pace Blvd right up the road
from where your bus is sitting.

&gt; For those who remember my disaster last week and the subsequent firestorm
I
&gt; created with my initial posting, I'll tell you where I am and ask some
advice
&gt; on which way to turn. The details of the problems with the other engine
will
&gt; remain between the mechanic, the seller, and me, but here's the deal.
&gt; Option 1. Rebuild existing 1600 upright- estimate $1572.00
&gt; Option 2. Buy already rebuilt 1600 (I think he called it a short block, so
&gt; would someone explain why its called that?) for  $1760.00
&gt; Option 3. Install brand new (long block?) for $1650.00
&gt; My questions are:
&gt; Why would I do a rebuild by them which is the longest time in the
shop,(and
&gt; remember I only drove my new toy 80 miles before disaster) if I can come
up
&gt; with a couple hundred more dolllars and have a new one installed? The only
&gt; reason I can come up with would be originality, but I found out from
mechanic
&gt; that this engine was a '71 in a '70 anyway.
&gt; How can a new engine be a hundred bucks or so cheaper than a rebuild, and
so
&gt; why would I buy a rebuild? He said something about it possibly being the
&gt; exchange rate because the total rebuild comes from overseas. I guess this
is
&gt; possible.
&gt; Are there different makes of &quot;new engines&quot; and if so, should I post the
&gt; brand(assuming that's the way to go) so I can get some feedback on brand?
&gt; I can pack a lot of questions into one posting can't I? Please feel free
to
&gt; comment on all or none, and thanks again for helping a newbie on a &quot;major
but
&gt; determined uphill learning curve&quot;!
