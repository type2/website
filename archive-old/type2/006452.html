Dear List Members,

 Through this message I would like to ask anyone with electronic pictures of
your vehicles, accessories, parts, closeups of parts that are installed or
not; basically anything (with a short description) that you can send me of
busses up to 1979.

 The purpose is to create a website to display the above. I am restoring a
56 Standard and have yet to find a set of pictures depicting how it should
look in its original state, inside and out. The proper equipment, the proper
place for such equipment, etc. And no, it is not a commercial site. Just a
spot in the Internet for those that wish to find and example of how a
restored vehicle should look when it originally came out of the factory. I
understand that a number of the vehicles might not be exactly original but
the pictures will help either way. At this point in time, I have a number of
pages already setup to be transferred to one of my sites. The main problem
is that most of the pics that I have are from a few sites that display them
in For Sale advertisements. I don't know how the owners would react to see
their beloved busses in the type of site that I pretend to create. I guess I
could set the site and see the reactions, good or bad.

 I would appreciate your cooperation in this matter. If you wish to send
these files, here's my address.

If you wish to see a couple of pics of my vehicle,

 Thank you, very much!
