You means the battery tray on the driver's side?

&gt; Looks like it could be a factory drain
&gt; hole????? Wondering whether to plug or not????

I've been told there was a plug there originally that was supposed to help
it drain but instead it seems not to work as designed and water accumulated
anyway.

I've got new trays now and I'm leaving them unplugged. I'll keep tabs on the
trays like the rest of the bus now that I know they are prone to rusting.
