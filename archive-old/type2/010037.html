	For pre-lambda systems just checking the EGR operation or
just resetting the button is fine. For lambda systems the came check-
light was used to indicate it was time to change the O2 sensor. The
O2 sensor fails 'happy' on a Rabbit and the resulting rich mix can
melt a catalytic converter. Which will produce some REALLY wierd
symptoms to trouble shoot. 
	I don't know if a Lambda bus will do the
same but I recomend strict adherence to factory recomended intervals
for O2 sensor replacement. Cheap insurance.
