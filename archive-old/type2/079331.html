Subject: Heat

I just thought that with all the recent talk about heaters, and how drafty
our Busses are, I'd call your attention to page 9 of the 1976 Volkswagen
Type 2 Owners Manual.  Under subtitle &quot;Doors,&quot;

&quot;Since your Volkswagen is almost air tight it will be easier to close the
door if you open a window slightly.&quot;

So there you have it.  Air Tight.  Which means all you people riding around
shivvering in your Busses, obviously haven't read your owners manual.

Happy Friday.  Be warm.
