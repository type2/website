&gt; Not really; if you measure the thickness of the stained glass in
&gt; venerable European cathedrals, you'll find the glass to be thick-
&gt; er at the bottom than the top...Eventually (admittedly a looong
&gt; eventuality ;-), the glass will have &quot;melted&quot; out the windows...

Sorry, this is a Physics Legend.

Back when the cathedrals were built glass was far from flat.  It was
the custom of glaziers to install glass thick edge down, which is where
this legend started.  Occasionally they will find a pane where the glazier
screwed up and installed it thick-edge-up.

Glass is _technically_ a liquid, and it will flow, but the time frame to
see visible evidence of this at normal temperatures is in the millions of
years, not hundreds.  Nevertheless, well-meaning science teachers
propogate this Physics Legend.

As far as windshelds are concerned, they are a laminate of glass and
plastic, and the plastic _will_ deform if it is stressed.  Windshields
should be stored in such a way that their shape is supported, either
vertically or horizontally.
