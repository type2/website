This one seems to be popular.

&gt; I know the cooling is an issue, but what has been suggested to me is the
&gt; mount a rad on the rear, or run bellowsflex tubing all the way to the front
&gt; for a rad mount there.

I've seen a radiator in the left side of the engine compartment with an
electric fan.  The most important thing is to prevent recirculation of
cooling air.  I've seen a couple of nice installations with huge
radiators that still overheated because there was no attention to
recirculation.

Another possible mounting point is at an angle between the frame rails,
boxing in the frame rails to provide a duct long enough to prevent
recirculation.

&gt; Creatively suggested was two small rads, one mounted in each air scoop with
&gt; a fan on each, a small rad like a fiero or something may work in that case,
&gt; then it still looks stock.

The problem with using the stock ducts is that you are dependent upon the
cooling fans pretty much all the time.  There isn't much &quot;ram air&quot; effect
from the stock intakes.  If you look at them you'll see they point mostly
sideways!

&gt; The subie motor is not that hard to cool and does not require a huge rad.
&gt; Plus a bonus, the engine is a boxer, bombproof, puts out 77-80 hp stock (10
&gt; more than stock type 4) and with an easy upgrade like a weber, one gets the
&gt; power out to at least 85 hp.

Of course, you could go with a later model 2.5l engine and get 165HP!  :)
