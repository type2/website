	[Crick, Bill ]  A friend in high school had a set of headphones in
his car
	that hung on the lighter, and there was a jack just under the
stereo.
	The ignition power was disabled when the headphones were either
plugged in , or unplugged.
	I forget which. If it was unplugged to disable, then the headphone
plug had a short circuit in it.
	If plugged in was disabled, then he used the switches that normally
disabled speakers 
	when the headphones were plugged in. The headphones had nothing to
do with the stereo, they
	were his secret disable switch.
