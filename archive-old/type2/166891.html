Subject: Anybody parting a bay?  Need a frame section-Mouse pee damage

I have a '77 7 passenger bus that I am trying to resurrect after a long storage.
Tonight I found a very nasty surprise.? Mice built a nest in the enclosed section of frame where the brake proportioning valve mounts (inside the frame rail under the driver's seat).?
 Of course you know what mouse pee does.
I think that I can section the rail in without too much problem if I can find a donor piece to trim and use.? I could make a replacement section, but I'd rather just do the repair with an original piece.
If anyone is hacking up a bus and would be willing to torch off a non-mouse-pee-rusted section of frame rail from about where the hole that the left front brake hard line goes thru the frame to the vertical panel at the rear of the fenderwell, (where the outrigger and jack point meet the frame)please email me at mbjeeper_at_aol_dot_com and let me know what you have to have for it.
Thanks,
Greg Burke
