Subject: Monza style exhaust

&gt;If you strip off the cheap paint and use a high temp
&gt;header paint or BBQ paint on them I think they'll
&gt;last a reasonable amount of time. Still not as long
&gt;as a stock muffler, but better than they way they
&gt;come out of the box.


I doubt it. Monza's are cheap. That's the only good
thing I can say about them. IMHO they have a tendency
to fall apart before they have time to rust out.
