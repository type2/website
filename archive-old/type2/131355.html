Subject: Re: [T2] Exhaust port gaskets at heads.

Let me change my question from:

&quot;&quot;Anybody?? Is there a difference (other than VW part number) in the 1700 
and in the 1800-2000 exhaust port gaskets?
&quot;&quot;
to:

&quot;&quot;Anybody?? Is there a difference (other than VW part number) in the 1700 
and in the 1800 exhaust port gaskets?
&quot;&quot;

They are listed with different VW numbers AND DIFFERENT PRICES at bus boys 
and bus depot.
