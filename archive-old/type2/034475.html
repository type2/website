	To the best of my knowledge, the nose cone should have no problems, 
but the bell housing is slightly different.  For one thing, the starter
hole is different, 
and I think you have to use a later starter (if it is infact off of a
'75) and you will have 
to cut the shaft about a half of an inch if you are using an upright
engine.   I don't 
about the throwout bearing, but I would asume you need to use an earlier
('68-'71) 
throwout bearing
