I've seen a few threads lately regarding these, and I thought someone 
might like to know of a source for them. Here's the poop from Jameco:

Thermoelectric coolers (TECs) are solid state heat pumps that utilize the 
Peltier effect. During operation, heat is transferred from one side of 
the pump to the other resulting in a hot and cold side with differences 
up to 60 deg. C. Cascade two for up to 131 deg. C.

max.
