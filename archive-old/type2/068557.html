Subject: Re: model ident needed ??

I have the same model, at least by # (244) and description on bottom 
(fourgon). EXCEPT mine is red and says &quot;Cafe Hag&quot; on each side with some 
french words describing the coffee.  I found mine at a flea mkt this past 
summer.  Unfortunately, mine's pretty ratty, with a missing rare hatch. :(
LMK if you find any other info on this.  The back of the latest Majorette 
packages also list a &quot;fourgon&quot;, whatever that is, so maybe a new one is 
out as well.
