&gt;I'm sure most of you have noted in the &quot;Hot VW mag.&quot; of this month an add

&gt;the MAHP   6 stud heads that don't leak.   I found  very interesting the
&gt;possibility of raising my original 1,679cc engine into a 2,242cc using
&gt;this kit
&gt;with the 104 mm liner and pistong set.   David,  Paul, Jhon: Are this the
&gt;heads
&gt;that you have been refering to ??.   I would really like to have your opinion.

My advice is stick to stock 94mm pistons and liners.  You are asking for
trouble by going to the larger ones.  To utilize them you'd need ported
heads and probably other intake and cooling mods.  I've never had a problem
with my stock 94's leaking either, so why the extra bolts?  They're for
people running huge bore and stroke, high compression engines.  The average
bus owner doesn't need such things.
