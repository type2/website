Subject: RE: [T2] VW bus sighting the different way

&gt; just played around with G**gle Earth and found my bus on

Well, if we're going to play that game, here's a view of VW Bus Camp at
Burning Man last September.

=1&amp;z=19&amp;ll=40.760186,-119.212456&amp;spn=0.001497,0.002913&amp;iwloc=addr

My bus is the one with the big pentagon-shaped canopy in front of it.

BTW, Some more recognizable pictures of the camp, taken at ground-level,
can be found in my album:
