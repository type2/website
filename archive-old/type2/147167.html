Subject: Re: [T2] who sells the cheapest TMI headliner

Actually Richard, my TMI interior for my 70 bug went on flawlessly and looks
great!! I didn't even use the Hog Ring plier kit that I bought, it fit so
well and snug that it wasn't needed. I can send you pics if you'd like.

Take care,

Courtney

If cheap is your goal go with TMI. Nothing of theirs fits the first

time.

 

For better products try sewfine (see their doublecab headliner):
