&gt; Glad to see that Ron is now willing to increase my credit card debt:)&gt;
&gt; However, my shopping cart keeps coming up empty after I enter
&gt; quantities and I tried the email link on his page but keep getting an
error. Ron
&gt; or someone please help me before Michele realizes that I have the VISA
card!


The shopping cart requires that Cookies be turned on on your browser.  If
you have set your browser's &quot;preferences&quot; not to accept them, you'll have to
temporarily turn them back on in order to use the shopping cart.

Also, there is a known problem with a few isolated releases of the popular
browsers which may cause the &quot;view cart&quot; feature to mistakenly show you an
empty cart.  Sometimes, hitting 'refresh'  may solve this.  On the rare
browsers where this happens, in most cases the items actually *are* in your
cart, and will show up when you go to check-out.  You can go to check-out
and see if they're there, and still use your back button to add more items
if you like.

Regarding the email link not working, I'll have to look into this.  That is
not a problem that I'm aware of.
