Subject: GROOVE OctoBugFest (Springfield, MO, USA)

GROOVE (General Registry Of Ozarks' Volkswagen Enthusiasts) is hosting an 
All-German Marque Show, Shine &amp; Swap on Sunday, October 27th from 11am - 
5pm in Springfield, Missouri.  It will be held at the Lyons Thrift Store 
parking lot at 2120 W. Kearney.  This will be a rather informal affair to 
celebrate the German heritage of our favorites vehicles.  It's B.Y.O.B. 
(Bring Your Own Bratwurst!).  See you there!
