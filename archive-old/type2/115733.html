&gt; Is there somewhere to find a diagram of the vacuum hoses for my 1800cc
&gt; engine, a ledgible diagram for idiots that is.  I need to replace all of them
&gt; but 
&gt; each one is a little bigger or smaller, and outside of cutting a little piece
&gt; of 
&gt; each one off and looking like a moron, it would be nice to know wich is
&gt; which.

I've been having an incredibly hard time trying to find hoses for my engine.
It seems that VW used some very strange sizes that no one makes any more (or
probably ever made).  I spent some time with the main dealer going through
them all on the parts fiche (CD) and wrote down the sizes (which agree with
what I measured).  I have a 2 litre carb engine (CJ) but it's not much
different to the 1800.

Crankcase breather 14x4mm
Balance pipe to LH carb 11x3.5mm
Balance pipe to manifold 9x3mm (one each side)
Preheat thermostat control vacuum 4x3mm (3 pieces)
Distributor vacuum 3.5mm (2 pieces)

The first figure is the inside diameter, the second figure is the wall
thickness.  The distributor hose is very common but the others are like the
proverbial rocking horse droppings.  They are 'in between' the normal sizes
like 3/8&quot;, 1/2&quot;, 5/8&quot; etc.

I hope you have better luck than me.  If you do find some the right size, I
would be eternally grateful if you would buy extra and send me some.  From
memory, you will probably need about a foot of the 4mm, 4&quot; of 9mm, 2&quot; of
11mm and 18&quot; of 14mm.

As I say, I have a slightly different engine to you, so YMMV.
