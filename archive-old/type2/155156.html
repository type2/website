Subject: Creature comforts

Hi All, 

After a nice trip to Daytona and back (about 300 miles round trip), I've
compiled a list of &quot;creature comforts&quot; that I'd like to add to the
bus.  

#1.  Replace the stock seats with more comfortable seats that have
armrests and headrests.  The original seats will be cleaned, tagged,
bagged, stored in a plastic bin, and put into storage.  I'll get a pair
(quartet?) of seat rails so I don't bugger up the originals. 

#2. Stereo.  The PO installed a CD deck, but it has a tendency to skip,
and with KYB's all the way around, it skips a lot.  It also has issues
playing burned CD's, unless I burn them at 1x, which takes 74-80 minutes
per disc.  Ugh.  Over the weekend I purchased a Pioneer unit that
handles CD[R&amp; RW], tuner, and MP3 CD's.  Once the rain quits, I'll get
it installed.  Also looking for a console to mount behind and above the
driver/passenger area to mount some 6x9's, move the rear 6x9's into the
sides of the bus, and add a pair of modest subwoofers under the rear
bench seat.  

#3. Tint.  The PO's tint is peeling in places, and it's too light for my
taste.  Since the bus is red, I'll spring for the so-dark-it's-barely-
legal red-tinged tint.  It'll reduce the bus's inside temp after sitting
in the sun too.  

#4. Cargo netting.  Behind the seats, to keep the dogs from getting
whacked in the head when I shift, plus some at the front between the
seats to keep items from rolling into the footwell when some idjit cuts
me off and I have to jam on the brakes.  

#5. AC unit.  The under-dash units don't thrill me.  They seem to only
work well for the driver/passenger, and they're expensive as heck.  I'm
currently searching for a unit from an RV (in the 8-12K BTU range) to
strip down and mount in the passenger side of the engine compartment.
Run the condenser coil underneath the bus, run the evaporator coil to
the front, add a blower/controls/etc.   Probably have to step up to a
95A alternator to pull it all, and add an idle kick-up selenoid.  
  So far the units I've looked at are small enough to fit (with the
coils relocated), but require 12v at 11-18A to operate.  Of course the
smallest new unit I've seen is 11K BTU also.  Plenty of cold for the
people up front, and in the back of the bus.  


Stereo and seats will happen first.  AC will probably be last, unless I
luck up and find a good deal on a system.  Yup, it'll be sorta kludged
together, but there isn't much to an AC system, and I got a buddy who
owes me a favor, anyway ;)

Thoughts? Comments?  Snide remarks?
