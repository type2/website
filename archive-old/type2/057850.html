Tomorrow's the big day....we're heading up to Rochester, NY to deliver my
son and his 78 bus to R.I.T....he's driving his 78 and I'm following with
the rest of the family in the EuroVan. So, if you are in the Rochester area
and see a two-toned brown 78 bus w/Massachusetts plates...that would be
him...our addition to the Rochester VW scene. :-)
