FYI, I solved the idling problem. It was the AFM. I'm on to other, more
perplexing problems, like now I have a backfire when I let off the
accelerator, but I don't seem to have an exhaust leak. Intake or vacuum
leak is doubtful, but not without question. New engine. Not yet through
breakin...could be unseated valves, but I don't like the idea of running
through breakin with any amount of backfiring.

Comments welcomed! :) Joe
