Subject: Battery Charge Question

I had to boost my type 1 gen equipt motor today after discovering a dead
battery - I tightened up the belt and the charging system seemed to be working
( 13 .3 v _at_ idle )
Let it run and drove around for about an hour - turned it off turned it back
over- and had a very slow starter until it eventually died ( 3 tries to
start)
I checked the voltage on the battery and it read 12.1
When I turned the key to start the voltage dropped to 8 volt then 6 then 5
Am I looking at a bad battery as the most likely cause or are my charging
numbers not up to snuff?

Thanks
Eric
