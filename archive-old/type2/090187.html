Subject: Re: [T2] New Westy Owner - Sliding Door Question

Caldwell et.al.,
  
  I too have a '78 Westy whose sliding door is a PITA.  One thing I
found that helped, was to replace the plastic guide that is part of the
rear of the sliding door.  Check this piece and replace it if need be. 
Also, a general cleaning, lubing and examination of the tracks will
help.  If you're interested in how to remove the door, let me know and
I'll send more detailed directions.
  On another note, further examination of my sliding door revealed this
problem.  The guide track on the lowest part of the door has been
damaged.  Possibly from a side collision or just plain worn out.  I'm
working on my auto body skills and plan to beat it straight again when
I get confident.  Get a flashlight out and check all of your tracks...

&gt; Immediate problem is that the sliding door is hard to open from both
&gt; outside and inside. I removed the door panel and took a look. I did
&gt; not see any adjusting nut for the cable on my 1978 per suggestions on
&gt; some previous posts. Must only be for earlier years ?The problem
&gt; seems to be in the front handle mechanism. You can turn it almost all
&gt; the way down before it even enages the cable with any resistance. Is
&gt; there some type of adjustment in the front handle mechanism ? I did
&gt; not take it apart yet.. hoping to get some ideas from the list first
&gt; ! How are you suppossed to adjust this on the 1978 model ?
