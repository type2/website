&gt; Do you need any dwell meter, really? Timing is WHEN the spark is (turn

&gt; voltmeter set to continuity buzzer (or even a test light) and some
&gt; knowledge of geometry of a circle, one can figure dwell either on a
&gt; distributor or by marking 50 degrees on your crank fan (type 4 engine)
&gt; or pulley wheel on an upright engine?!.

Good point.  I'll have to check that the next time I set my dwell.  I do
note that the dwell varies a bit with RPM, but all you really need to do
is get the center of the range.
