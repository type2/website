Subject: Re: [T2] Help with buying brass drift for wheel bearing race

&gt;If you're punching out the races because you're going to replace them 
&gt;then just grab something suitable and tap them out.  There's no point 
&gt;in saving old races that I can see.  

I agree except for the old races not having any use.  I've always used the
old race to tap the new one into place.  Just the right size and you don't
tear up your pretty new race.  And don't forget - cook the hubs, freeze the
races prior to installation.
