&gt; &gt; BTW, what you need heat for in Anaheim???
&gt;
&gt; Defroster. Wives who get cold. Driving in the mountains to go sledding.

VW stock heat is adequate for that, I ski in the &quot;COLD&quot; mountains up North
and get up for first tracks, long before dawn with the temps below 0, that
is what I think of as cold, and that is where that Eberspracher pays for
itself....one option I have is a block heater and plug in the bus at night
for easier starts....
