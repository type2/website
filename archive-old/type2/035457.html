Subject: Responses to the call for garage/work space

I got a few responses to my call for garage and work spaces, some of them 
very generous but none of them west of the Rocky Mountains.

Ken Hooper p-mailed me to point out that all the data I was asking for 
was already on the AIRS site. And so it was. But the general request I 
sent out was made in the context of our discussion of reliability and 
preventative maintenance, whereas the R in AIRS stands for rescue. I 
suggested to Charlie Ford that there be a nod toward preventative 
maintenance on the AIRS page (AIRS-PM?) and he assented, but the AIRS 
site is his baby, and a fine thing, and I don't really want to muck 
around with it.

So here is my suggestion: if you are planning a journey in your bus, and 
you suspect that you might break down because of some bit of deferred 
maintenance, then visualize the break down. Imagine that the worst has 
already happened, and get in touch with someone on the airs site to 
arrange for space to repair it. Maybe toss some marbles into your fan and 
put the screen back on, to be convincing.

As for me, when it comes time to drop my engine and fit a new bottom end, 
I am going to drive from San Diego to Colorado, where Dave has generously 
offered me space to work and a soak in the hot tub to get the grease off.
