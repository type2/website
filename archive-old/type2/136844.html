Subject: Re: [T2] Bob Hoover

Ben,

Bob Hoover was the most visible of a number of people on this list who 
dispense advise, wisdom, and humor. It would be nice for us if he were 
back, but I'm not sure it would be so good for him. Even though the 
moderators try to run a tight ship, there is much latitude about 
attitude on this list. To have it all focused on you, as it was on Bob 
Hoover from time to time, can be a bit much.

Besides, the wisdom of Bob Hoover is well distributed on this list. 
Folks like David Schwartz, George Lyle, and Mike Benthin were steeped 
in it, and are more than willing to give back. Then there are Doktor 
Tim, Scott Lyon, and others with a wealth  of technical knowledge. And 
everything that Bob Hoover could say in words, Richard Atwell has four 
pictures on his website to illustrate.

And if you want someone with lots of character, well, there's Don.

It would nice to have Bob Hoover back, but frankly I think he would be 
redundant.

Mark Hineline
