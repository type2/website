Subject: RE: No lights, engine seal and break problems '72 bus

No lights....

Others have had this problem when they have bypassed the ignition switch, your
time would be more profitably spent fixing the real problem rather than working
around it.

Appaently the electrical part of the ignition is no longer a VW stock item so
you may need to visit breakers yards for the switch.


Engine seal....

The engine space in the bus should be same regardless of the engine style 
(upright or Type IV) the space between the engine and the van is taken up with
the tin ware leaving a gap about 1 inch / 25mm to be taken up with the foam 
seal.
If you have a large gap then it sounds like the previous owner has removed a 
type 4 engine (I think that was standard for a 72 bus in the USA) with a type 1
engine but not put in the necessary tin ware.

Again this would be breakers yard stuff (or swap meets).


Brake problems....

If your upright engine (or at least the input manifold) came from a pre-servo 
brakes Bus or Bug then you will not have the vacume take off point. This is a 
large tube coming from the left side of the upright part of the input manifold 
just below the carb.

(To frustrate you even more I've got an input manifold with this take-off but
no power assisted brakes).
