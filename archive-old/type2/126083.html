Hi Michael,

The flywheel lock with a flex plate is REALLY simple.... Just use a 
loop of coat hanger wire to connect one bolt-hole of the flex-plate to 
one of the motor mount bolts. This will keep the flex plate from 
turning enough to torque the bolts up to spec, or to remove them.

Happy trails,
