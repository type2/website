Subject: Re: [T2] where to buy a new engine?

&gt; A T1 magnesium case is almost impossible to weld up from what I have seen
&gt; (T4 and aluminum T1 can be welded).

You may want to get as far way from that building as you can before someone
tries to to weld magnesium. If you've ever been to a motorcycle roadracing
event, when it gets dark the racer boys and girls start throwing their
cracked magnesium wheels into the fire, the show is incredible, absolutly
white fire, amazing. I don't even want to think about a fire like that in a
garage. That's the reason magnesium cases and such are labeled as being
magnesium, like bus tranny cases. Don't weld them!

&gt; &gt;The mechanic here says that even if I get a new case, there will be quite
a
&gt; bit of labor involved transferring everything over. At $85/hour&lt;
&gt;
&gt; First off where are you?  Many people may be able to recommend a good shop
&gt; in your area if we know your location.
&gt;
&gt; A T1 magnesium case is almost impossible to weld up from what I have seen
&gt; (T4 and aluminum T1 can be welded).
&gt;
&gt; Also $85 an hour is ridiculous for an air-cooled engine!  Sounds like
dealer
&gt; prices to me....   Unless you know this is an awesome shop that will do a
&gt; perfect job which takes time.
&gt;
&gt; Call up Jake Raby http://www.aircooledtechnology_dot_com/ (GA) and have him
&gt; build you a great engine or Mark Dearing at Salem Imports (VA) or Boston
&gt; Bob.  All known good sources for engines.
&gt;
&gt; I suspect the previous engine builder used a bad case to build your engine
&gt; to begin with if the mileage is low and the crack is not a &quot;dumb user&quot;
type
&gt; of thing.  Ask him if he magnafluxed the case for cracks :)  Seriously,
the
&gt; answer will be funny for sure.  IF he claims to be ultra high end then
there
&gt; should have been better quality control, but a regular shop will not do
this
&gt; to cases.  It will be interesting to see if the guy stands behind his
engine
&gt; and work...
&gt;
&gt; I good used case ready to go should cost 125-150.  A new case just check
&gt; around for a good price.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Good luck,
&gt; Adrian
