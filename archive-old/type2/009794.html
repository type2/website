&gt;&gt;distributor for the '72 bus.  This distributor is a rebuilt Bosch

&gt;&gt;vacuum-advance model distributor.  The VW number stamped on the body was
&gt;&gt;211-905-205-Q and the NAPA part number was #48-916.

&gt;&gt;Can anyone tell if this VW number is the correct one for the '72?

&gt;NO a 211 Q is for a 71 1600 upright engine bus. Wrong!
&gt;Your distributor should be a 021 905 205E and should have a dual vacuum unit 
&gt;on it.

Actually, if a distributor is purchased rebuilt, it can have *any* number on the
side.  

I know; we all need *another* variable in our lives.  

I have a rebuilt distributor on my 1600DP (purchased from Bus Depot) that has a
number on the side declaring it to be a single-vac-advance dizzy for an early
beetle.  The innards and vacuum can, however, are the proper advance, retard,
etc. for my model.  (Yes, I've checked this out with a strobe.  It's okay. 
Really.  And it's *real* purty.  :))

Basically, you have to check the proper advance and retard specs in Bentley for
your engine, then make sure your distributor does what it's supposed to.  The
number on the side can mean nothing; it may be that the body of your distributor
is that of a distributor whose innards have long since winged their way off to
The Land Where Distributors Are Eternally Blessed.
