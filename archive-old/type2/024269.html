&gt;           Given that the stock '72 tank has no return line for the fuel
&gt; pressure regualtor, how did you solve this problem? I've experienced
&gt; somewhat the same problem as you are describing, but it's not all the
&gt; time, usually only when the engine is hot, and then I have a long idle.
&gt; What it seems to me to be is vapor-lock -- and the reason I deduced why
&gt; mine does it is that my '73, like yours, has no return line for the
&gt; tank, so I put a T in the line before the fuel pump, for the regulator
&gt; return line. Someone else said awhile back that the tank acts as heat
&gt; sink for the fuel, and without that, it's a bit prone to vapor-lock. On
&gt; mine, it only happens during serious heat situations (long traffic lines
&gt; after getting off the freeway in Alabama) so I just turn it off, rather
&gt; than sit there and idle.
&gt;         Probably should change the tank, but I'm lazy, and more inclined
&gt; to dump the gas engine and put in a turbodiesel anyway.
&gt;         And if that ain't it, I have no clue.  Could be just that your
&gt; fuel line got routed too close to something hot, too.
&gt; 

This seems to make sense.  Because I do not have problems at normal speeds, more of the gas is recirculating and being used, but at idle, less gas is being used and is being allowed to heat up.

I measured the surface temp of my fuel pump an it was 120 degrees and rising when it started sputtering.  Another note shaking the fuel regulator will make it run a little longer when the sputtering begins.

I'm not exactly sure what I will do to confirm this.  I may run a long line from the regulator back to fuel tank via the filler (that sounds safe) to see if that will prevent  the vapor lock from occuring.  This will at least confirm the problem, what the solution is is another question.

How have other dealt with fuel injection and at non fuel injected fuel tank?
