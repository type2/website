Subject: Re: [T2] L43 grey black

I can't comment on the actual color. I specifically looked for a &quot;no&quot;
gloss black, as flat black is a pain to keep clean, and gloss reflects
light into your eyes.

I guess I should have worried about heat,,, as the paint pealed the first
time it was parked in  the direct sun in the summer.

sorry I don't know the answer,, as I still have to repaint mine.
I was thinking powder coat would be my next attempt
