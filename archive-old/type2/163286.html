Subject: Re: [T2] brake line length question

Mark -

What you need is 211 611 741 K, 2180mm, 85.5&quot;.  On 71 to Early 73 Type 2s
(To vin 2x3 2044 832), this runs from the Brake Pressure Regulator (211 612
501 A) to the Rear &quot;T&quot;.  From the Master Cylinder to the Brake Pressure
Regulator is 211 611 761, 855mm, 33.66&quot;.  That's probably where you're
getting confused.  Bus Depot has them (or should).

&gt; I recently got my '71 Camper home (my first ever VW), and am working on
&gt; replacing a brake line that burst open while bleeding the brakes.
&gt; The line that burst goes from the master cylinder to the rear T
&gt; connecter, and as I measured it, it is 86&quot; long.
&gt; Now on the busdepot_dot_com site, it says the center brake line is 33.66&quot;
&gt; in length, and on the autozone website the longest line they list for
&gt; the bus is 60&quot; in length.
&gt; Basicaly my question is this:  I know that I need and 86&quot; 3/16&quot; metal
&gt; brake line with metric threads, but where do I get it from?  Do I just
&gt; go to an auto parts store and tell them what I need?
&gt; I'm new to VWs and replacing brake lines, so I'm sorry for the n00b
&gt; question.
&gt; Thanks!
