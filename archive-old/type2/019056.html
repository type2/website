Hi Volks;
   Dave Christensen in Phoenix just reported Nikki headed out on the
final leg of her adverturesome journey...IH-10 Phoenix to LA. Nikki said
she would try to express her thoughts on the journey when she got home,
on her own computer.

   Go Nikki, go!

   With a little luck we'll have a final report on the trip tonight.

   And those of you who have not signed up on the AIRS site, get going,
it worked like a charm for Nikki and you never know what lies just down
the road.
