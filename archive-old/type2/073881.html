Subject: problems with recent rebuild

Hi All, 

As some of you may remember, I recently had my 1600dp rebuilt in my 71 westy. 
Since then it has gotten paint and it ready for me to travel. It starts right 
up and will idle fine after a while (the darn choke has been disconnected and 
I cant for the life of me figure it out). Problem is that after about an 
eight to ten mile trip it runs extremely hot (smoke gushing from rear side 
vents) and loses a bit of power. 
It is not using oil, nor losing oil and the fresh air hoses are hooked up. 
(How can I tell for sure if my vents are open to get air to the engine?) I 
cant for the life of me figure out what's happening, and I am antsy to get it 
moving right. I need to take to over to get a new battery tray welded in so I 
can take advantage of this great camping weather!
Anyone have any ideas, or wanna help?

Thanks all!
Melissa
