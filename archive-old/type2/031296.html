&gt; Underneith between the frame rails was some kind of protective plate.
&gt; Coming out the side of the van in front of the drivers side rear wheel was
&gt; what looked like a exhaust pipe.  I can not see anything because of this
&gt; plate.  Any ideas?  I probably will not buy the bus as it needs a transaxle.
