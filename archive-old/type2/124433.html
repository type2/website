Subject: Re: [T2] headlight flicker

Could be the voltage regulator. Are they flickering as in
dim,bright,dim,bright with relation to the rpm's. This is what mine were
doing and a new regulator did the trick.

&gt; I'm having troubles with my headlight.  It winks all the way down the 
&gt; highway, but only on low beams.  Is this a wiring issue?
