Subject: Re: Electronic Ignition, Should I?

I installed a Compufire system in my 68 Westy, 1600 dp with an 009. It's
a simple installation, have had no problems with it. The parts involved
are a reluctor disc (fits under the rotor) and a little switch unit that
replaces the points. As the disc revolves, it triggers the spark by
opening and closing the switch magnetically. Comes with a 30K warranty.
I've gone back and checked the timing etc. just because, and it's always
right on the money. I don't miss having to fiddle with points at all!
IMHO, it's the way to go. FYI, a coworker tried a Bosch electronic
system in his beetle, and apparantly the control unit wasn't right, as
it didn't run right no matter what he did (and it was a bit pricey). I
like the Compu system because it uses a regular coil (although I used a
Bosch blue coil in place of the stock coil), instead of some extra
electronic parts to go bad down the road. Plus, it's inexpensive.  Once
again I adhere to the KISS principle!   ;-)

Just my $.02!
