Hay, Everyone!

     I just ordered a pertronix igniter and 40,000v coil for my 79'
2000FI stock bus, and a friend told me to change my spark plug gap to
.034 instead of stock of .028, is this OK, or should I leave it alone? I
looked in the archive's and library but didn't find any reference to
this. Any info will be great!
Thanks,
Shawn Reed
