I have an AC system that I have no idea what it is on my 79 Westy originally
sold in Virgina. It sits under my dash and looks just like the dash
material, has 4 vents in it, and a temp control on the left side and a
min-max control on the right side. I have what appears to be two huge
radiators/coolers mounted underneath the van with expanded metal mesh
coverings, and two large cans of some type, one mounted in the rear engine
compartment by the passenger side taillight, and one under the same side
front tire area. The compressor is mounted in the engine compartment off to
the drivers side. What a pile of stuff, and of course it doesn't work.
Can I remove this crap, or is it fixable??
Thanks,
Courtney

&gt; Hello Holly and Chris,
&gt;
&gt; Is your &quot;Cool Inc&quot; AC system still sold today?  How do
&gt; you know you have to replace the piston type
&gt; compresor?  Does the inside unit fit under the dash,
&gt; or do you have to tear into the dash?
&gt;
