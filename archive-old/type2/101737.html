Subject: undercoating

  Yes, on the oil, and a big yes to grease.  I am up here in Vermont, where 
the snow can get deep, and salt will rust your bus to swiss cheese in a 
year. (trust me!)  In college, my lab partner was the president of the 
Mustang club in New Hampshire, wrote a book on restoring Mustangs.  She had 
a few show cars, and a few under way.  Showed me first hand how undercoating 
can trap moisture.  Undercoating was nothing more than something extra for 
you to buy at the dealer.  And oh how Ford loved to sell you that factory 
undercoating, knowing full well it had short comings.  I can tell you from 
first hand experience in Vermont anyway, that you are much better off with 
oil.  My bus is a 69 from Texas.  And though the undercoat worked well in 
Texas, after a few years here, that metal started to bubble under that 
undercoat.
  Unercoating may have changed over the years, but until I see some that 
holds up to serious weather, (at least 5 years on sand, salt, chemically 
treated roads) better safe than sorry.
