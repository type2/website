Subject: microbus/concept cars

   Why can't VW introduce a concept car that is truly that?  A revision of a 
beautiful classic like a bay window, available with air bags, a biodiesel 
power plant, and a fun toy or two like the navigation system seen in the 
&quot;Dune&quot;.  It seems to me the only concept that has been introduced to the 
automotive industry in the last 5 years is to make vehicles more blocky, 
less fuel efficient, and with an onboard computer that continually fails.
