FWIW, the rear blade - not the brackets - is the same from '66 - '72.

actually, though they look similar, they  arent the same.  Even without
overriders.   The brackets are different, the set up for overriders is
different, and the shape is also somewhat different.

 I've seen
a '71 bus with a '66 - '67 rear bumper on it, complete w/ overrider tubes and
bumper guards.

me too, and vice versa.  You can bolt them on.  I traded a beat up 68-71 rear
for a beat up 66-67 rear that was on this guy's 68.   He didnt give a hoot,
just wanted something on there.

And Heck, if you don't give a hoot about stock, a '58 - '65 rear
blade will work too. Though I imagine you'd probably get a lot of &quot; Hey dude,
you got du wrong bumpa on thar.&quot;

actually, the change from the stamped to the sturdy bumpers was 59 for the
new ones, but that's true.  and it's been done.  and with the earlier bumpers
too.  I found some 54-58 rear brackets on a later bus (no bumper, though )
