&gt;Some posted that they have 10x8 mm studs on thier bus.

I used to, but have since replaced the heads.

&gt;What kind of engine what that on?

Type IV 2.0 with 1.7 heads

&gt;How long were they, I can only find 38mm and I don't think these will work
&gt;on a Type IV.

They were a bit shorter than the old studs, but were long enough to do the 
job.  38mm sounds too short to me - the ones I had were about 2-1/4&quot; (56mm) 
long vs. the stock ones which I think were about 1/4&quot; longer.

I remembered the name of the place that I bought the studs - it was Harloff 
Import Parts in La Mesa, Ca (San Diego area).  It was many years ago 
though, so I don't know if they would still have them.

If you can't find the 10mm studs, another way to go would be 8mm studs with 
a helicoil kit (the helicoil itself is close to 10mm diameter).
