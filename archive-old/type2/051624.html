Subject: Re: [T2] Tranny problem?

It is normal for the wheels to rotate if the van is in neutral and the
back wheels are off the ground.  This is actually just the heavy gear oil
inside the tranny causing the output shaft to rotate.  

Since it's an open differential, that's why only one wheel is rotating.
The brakes are probably adjusted differently enough that one wheel is
stopped by the brake while the other is getting
all the torque (there's not much as it's just fluid so any kind of hang up
on the wheel will prevent it from turning -- you can even grab it and it
will stop).  

As far as not being able to get into any other gears, that's another
story.  Either a clutch adjustment issue or as you said a linkage issue
(can you get it into gear with the engine off?  If so, clutch issue.  If
not, linkage issue).

&gt; OK, I finally got the Terrpin Flyer started last month. Was waiting for a muffler and now I have it (thanks again, Nikki!) got it on and all that good stuff. After unsticking my rear right brake and charging the battery, I got the bus started this afternoon on my lunch hour, but now I have a problem. When the shift knob is in neutral, the right rear tire is spinning (still up on jack stands).  All attempts to put the bus in gear fail and I have no motion in the left rear wheel. I'm thinking shift linkage. Any suggestions?
