&lt;&lt; On another note, I took my Sapphire XXV stereo radio
to my local stereo sales store at lunch to get
serviced and the gentlemen working there looked at it
as if had just fallen from Mars.  They all laughed at
the fact that it surely was made before they were
born.  Little did they know it's a step up for me from
my blaupunkt am/fm mono $10 junkyard radio.  Greg

The local electric/electronic repair shop near me 
charges $65 as a basic fee for opening the box and
diagnosing any repairs...With a new am/fm CD radio
available from the big box stores at about $99, it's
no wonder most radio/stereo equipment is just r 'n
r'd instead of being repaired... ;-(
