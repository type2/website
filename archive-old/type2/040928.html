John, et al, 

I been a bit busy... I got the plans scanned this evening and they are at:

http://www.type2_dot_com/dworkin/dolly_small.jpg 
and
http://www.type2_dot_com/dworkin/dolly_big.jpg 

the first is 103K and fine for seeing and printing at home.  The second is
*huge* (4.2 meg)  and for those with access to professional facilities.
