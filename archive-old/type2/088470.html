Subject: Re: [T2] Westy Cot Question

[...]

68 to 73 were all 56 1/4&quot; long bars. Early were round black, late were 3 sided
galvanized steel. The 3 sided ones were a lot stronger.....
(74/75 were 57 1/4&quot; long; 76-79 were 2 piece collapsible but you can use the
57 1/4&quot; bars, just no where to store them)

&gt; Hello, I have a front cot from a 70 westy (the one over the front seats)
that
&gt; I'm selling and the potential buyer has a 73. Will the earlier, black pole
&gt; fit or does he need the later flat style poles? I just want to
&gt; sure.....thanks!
