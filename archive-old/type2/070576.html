Subject: stuck rear brakes

my bus has been stationary for quite a while, with the e-brake on. i 
went to move it the other day, and i think the rear brakes are 
sticking. is there an easy way to unstick them without disassembing 
the whole thing? I'm pretty sure i need to do some brake work anyway 
[which i'm having a shop handle], but i'd prefer driving it there to 
calling AAA and having to explain why i want a flatbed!

maybe there's something i can pry out with a screwdriver or some 
miracle lubricant?
