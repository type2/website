top of the carb.&lt;&lt;

Not sure about any other mailing lists.  If you really like the VWs you
might want to try the newsgroup 'rec.auto.makers.vw.aircooled.  Its got
info 'bout all aircooled VWs and might be interesting if you sort through
it all.

As far as oil level in the air cleaner, by old '65 bug had a plate inside
the air cleaner, up to which you were supposed to bring the oil level to.
I'm guessing that your air cleaner works in a similar fashion.  What ya
gotta do is to get the oil level up to where it soaks up into the filter
media where that is located in the top part of the air cleaner.  You need
the wooly lookin stuff to dip down into the oil probably about a quarter
inch, so fill the air cleaner up to that point.  If you look hard enough,
there is probably a red line or embossed mark on the outside wall of the
air cleaner which tells you the proper level.
