I was reading some of the messages on the UK 'Just Kampers' chat page
yesterday and noticed a couple of interesting posts...

&gt; : Is there anyone out there with a T25 crewcab fitted with a Type 1 lump?
I just made this conversion with 1700
&gt;barrels, mild cam and 041 heads - now really shifts and doesn't drink
petrol. Would love to hear of ANYONE who
&gt;has done the same.

&gt;: hello- this is not an answer -- iwould glad to read the return infos !!
&gt;: &gt;&gt; i have a t25 with stock 1600 ct engine (based on type 1 engine ) and
your engine choice is very interesting for me :
&gt;i have to rebuilt it and some extra power would be great
&gt;: ta - feefee

&gt;I have been doing it to the CT for a number of years using the Water Boxer
crank and a mild cam. You don't even
&gt;need to use posh heads, the 040 will suffuce. Couplede to a pair of ICT
carbs, you get power and economy. The thing
&gt;you must watch with the conversion you have done is cooling. If the engine
is allowed to recirculate its own hot air
&gt;you'll blow it. If you are using the upright T! engine I'd take a big
trunking from the fan housing into the under body
&gt;area.
&gt;I would also use and extra remote cooler.
&gt;Good going though. It won't work so well in the vans because of lid height
and nowhere to pick up cold ait. I have a
&gt;crew cab with a 2litre which will be replaced with a 1776 CT unit later
this year so anyone needing a CU engine could
&gt;gisaring

Interesting huh ???   (Perhaps the vanagon listees know all about this ?  -
Any comments on suitability for an early bay ?)

In a similar vein (also more suited to vanagon owners...)

&gt;: Is there anywhere that I can get a drive in drive out conversion from my
1.9 Wasserboxer to either a 2 litre Golf or
&gt;Audi engine. I see on the web that there are many firms in the USA doing
this - does anyone know if a British company
&gt;has started this yet.
&gt;
&gt;: Laurie do you do this - must be a big busines opportunity for a good
conversion. The US ones seem very slick and
&gt;together - check out Tom's VW Pages.
&gt;: Thanks

Oh the URL for the page is...
