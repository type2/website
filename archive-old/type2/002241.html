+AD4-Its been fun driving my 72 westy, not really though.  It HAS to be the fuel
+AD4-pump,

Don't be so sure, though obviously check all the easy things first. I went
through months of turmoil cutting out then it would start after standing
maybe half an hour. Sure enough the fuel wasn't getting through but the
problem was a blockage in the tank, and not one that would show up if you
just tried to drain it. Sorry those of you who've heard this before but it
was a piece of newspaper in there which kept getting sucked up the the
outlet. In the end after I'd tried absolutely everything else the tank had
to come out, and there it was, a piece of a larger sheet I'd foolishly
stuffed in the filler neck when doing some paint work.
