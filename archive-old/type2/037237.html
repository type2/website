Subject: Looking for contacts in a few cities

We are planning a rail trip around the country this summer
and have some stop overs in the following cities.  If it's
possible, we'd like to meet up with fellow VW Bus owners
at these points.  Email me if you live in these cities and
might be around in July/August:

New Orleans
Los Angeles (Union Station)
Anaheim (Disneyland!)
Seattle (Pioneer Square?)
Chicago
Boston (NH and VT too, by rental car)
DC

Thanks,
Dave
