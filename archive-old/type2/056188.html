Subject: Parts for Sale!

Hi Volks,
   I need to make room in the basement for a kayak project, so I'm offering
the following items for sale.  Pretty much everything is shippable via UPS,
even the engine cases, since they are just bare cases and don't weigh that
much.  
Everything below is from a pair of 1800 engines that I tore apart hoping to
rebuild one, but never got around to it, and didn't have enough money for
new parts anyhow, so here ya go:

4 1800cc heads (#021 101 371Q) in good shape, with valves (2 matched sets
of heads)  $125/pair

2 engine fan housings (magnesium) with fan - $40 each
2 oil coolers - $35 each
2 alternators (untested, but I assume they work) - $50 each
2 engine cases ($100/$75)
1 flywheel (210mm I think - came out of the 1800cc engine) $25

lots of other misc. small parts from both engines, like oil strainers,
plates, filler necks, oil pumps, etc... Contact me for needs, and I'll look
and see if I've got it)

also have two nearly complete sets of engine tin that went with the above
engines (72-79 style tin)

One of the engine cases is cleaned up and ready to go.  The other one needs
cleaning and has a small ear of metal broken off up near the rebreather
mount, which is easily repaired, and even without it the case is still
perfectly servicable.  

If interested in any of the above, get in touch with me via private e-mail
or call me at home (207)223-4923.  All prices are negotiable - I want this
stuff OUT - let's talk!
