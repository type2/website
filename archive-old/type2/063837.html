Subject: Help: (Distributor/Shaft connection)

Yesterday, my trusty, reliable '77 Camper died on the highway.

The cause turned out to be that my rotor was not turning. I'm getting a 
poor connection between the bottom of the distributor and the top of the 
distributor shaft in the engine. 

When I insert the distributor, it stops about 1mm from being fully 
seated. I then rotate the rotor until I match up with the shaft and it 
drops that extra 1 mm. (The notch on the distributor shaft is about 2mm 
deep.)

Anyway, there is some vertical (longitudinal) play in the shaft to which 
the rotor attaches. On the bottom of the distributor, the pivot plate 
that actually connects to the top of the distributor shaft has some play 
and 2 loose washers.

Soooooooo, are there any gaskets or whatever that keep the shaft (in the 
distributor snug? Has anyone taken one apart?

BTW, the distributor is stock vacuum advance.

Thanks,

Morris '77 Camper
