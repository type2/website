&gt;  Is there a way to easily distinguish these 'all new' Meximotor

&gt;from various vendors?

You mean the so called zero-mile engines? You really have to ask and deal with reuptable vendors.

&gt;Who's got the real thing?  Who's got the
&gt;BeetleMex/GEX knock-off?

Btlmex was selling the read deal but has closed down their business and website to the public.

Here's a Genuine VW longblock:
