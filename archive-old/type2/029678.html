Subject: Stranded in LA, need Auto Tranny
Message-ID: &lt;Pine.BSF.4.05.10011161848290.33478-100000_at_lenti.type2_dot_com&gt;

I got a call from a gentleman who is currently stranded in Newhall, CA
(just north of LA) with a dead auto transmission in his '76 westy.  He is
in need of either a used tranny or of a competent rebuilder.

Autos are out of my area of expertise, so I ask the assistance of
the list!  You may respond to Sam's voicemail (323) 402-1223 x5352 or in a
pinch send email here.  Any leads will be appreciated!

George Lyle
