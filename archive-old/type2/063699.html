Subject: Windshield wiper bushings

Volks,

The other day I noticed there was some rust forming underneath my front
windshield, so I removed the windshield so I could strip and paint it.
While the windshield was out, I thought it would be a convenient time to
paint the dashboard.  Oh heck I might as well take the dash out and install
the gauges properly in the radio hole like I've been meaning to do for a
long time.  I also need to do a lot of rewiring under the dash, which would
be really easy with the dash out.  So, I removed the dashboard.

Staring at my wiper assembly, I remembered it had been making clunking
noises, and I found that the metal bars that push the wipers were a little
loose on the drivers side.  It looks like the plastic bushings in the pivot
joints are cracked/worn.  Is there a source for these?  Or do you have to
replace the whole assembly?  I sure would like to fix it while it's easy to
get at.  Thanks for any information on this.  Now if I could just get this
all reassembled in time for BBTA...
