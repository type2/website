Subject: rear seal w/engine in? '72/2.0 liter
Message-Id: &lt;3.0.1.32.19991027071829.0080f430_at_volks_dot_net&gt;

Last Friday, Murphy played a cool trick on me: cool for him, that is.

He made my engine spit out the rear (RearIsRearOfBus) seal. I'm wondering
if anyone's successfully replaced this seal with the engine in the bus (or
half-way) dropped.

I'm trying to avoid the total engine pull, which on the '72 takes right at
2 hours out and 4 hours in (for me, working alone). That's enough to scare
away goblins and gouls on all Hallow's Eve!

For the curious, I was at the end of my suburban street, it was about 40
degrees out and I was trying to hurry (didn't let the bus warm up like
usual). Don't think all this made that much difference; if anything, it was
probably lucky for me, as I was within pushing distance of the house and
caught the problem immediately.

Thanks! Joe

PS I was surprised not to find this in the archives; I did look.
