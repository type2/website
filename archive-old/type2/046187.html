Subject: Re: [T2] 1970 owners manual

I am leaving tomorrow for  a three week trip driving from Ca to Tennessee and 
back. But when I return I can scan my 1970 manual, the westy supplement if 
anyone wishes. The 1970-2 brochure is available somewhere on the web. I you 
want, I can put that up on my site.
Let me know in three weeks.
