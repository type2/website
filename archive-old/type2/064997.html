Subject: Speaking of horn problems...

While we seem to have a horn thread going...

I'm a little unclear on how the horn is wired.

My horn hasn't worked since I got my bus ('64 deluxe). Fortunately, there is a 
single brown wire behind the dash with a push connector which is disconnected. 
I figure this is the reason the horn doesn't work, but I don't know where it 
should be connected.

Where does it go?

Thanks,

- --Jonny
