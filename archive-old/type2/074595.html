&gt;Mmmm,well so's Ford.
&gt;The minister from my church found out the hard way
&gt;that they hadn't cleaned all of the sand from the
&gt;casting process out of the engine block.....in North
&gt;Western Queensland(Australia) when the ambient
&gt;temperature was 42 degrees Celcius or well over 100
&gt;farenheit.


FORD is still doing this??? They were having problems with exactly that 
with the flathead engines back in 1932!!!

The engines had a reputation for running hot until a few hot rodders 
started really examining these things. One fellow was interviewed on a TV 
show and held up a mason jar half full of casting sand pulled out of one 
block recently.

Guess our air cooled engines wouldn't quite have the same problem....
