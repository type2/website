Subject: Removeing cabinet plans from events page soon
Date: Fri, 9 Feb 2001 23:13:19 -0000
	charset=&quot;Windows-1252&quot;

As I posted when I put these plans up, this was only a temporary thing as
the events page was not the correct place for them, if anyone wants them
still, get there soon! Of course these would be best placed in the library,
but that's not my playground ;)

Please remember that these were supplied by Steve Parry of Space craft. &amp;
any copies should also include his address - www.spacecraft-uk_dot_com If you
are one of the people who I sent these plans to, or if you have downloaded
them, could you please drop him a line to thank him

Thanks
