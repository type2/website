Subject: Metric or NPT was VDO oil Pressuse adapter question

So now I am beginning to wonder... Is this mysterious little hole standard
NPT thread or is it straight 10 X 1 metric??? If its just NPT I can make an
adapter out of stuff I have no sweat. I was under the impression that it
was metric...
