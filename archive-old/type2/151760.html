Subject: Unbelievable...heard it all now

You heard it here first(unless you are on the vintagvw list).

The newest thing...*scented* gas additive that comes in 
19, yes, *19* different smells.

I think I'll put some in my bus for Eureka Springs next 
weekend...hmmm...maybe cherry, or oh yeah, *chocolate*!  Then make my wife
follow me over in her car!

Can you imagine the looks when I fire up my bus and the exhaust smells 
like *chocolate*!.....and everybody else just smells like...ummm exhaust?

LOL!!!

And for those who care....I did *not* see any Ma....ummmmm....&quot;hemp&quot; 
smell.


ROTFLOL!

Cheers, dave
