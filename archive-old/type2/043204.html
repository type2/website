Subject: progress on bus

Hi,  Well the exhaust leak I was panicking about went
away. I guess the exhaust gaskets justed had to heat
up, I think they just melted and made a gasket.
I had started the bus the day before and it was smoking
bad but then the next day it wasn't as bad and after
5 minutes it went away completely :)

So I checked the points and timing again some how messed
up the points(ended up taking me awhile to fix it).
Fired her up and checked dwell pretty close, timing
good. Let it run again at 2000rmps for 10 mins,
20mins the day before. Shut it down check to make
sure all the hydraulic lifters where pumping up by
pushing on the rocker arms with a screw driver.
All were pumped up so that was great to find out.
I'll get someone to operate the starter while I
do a compression test saturday.

I temporary wired up the oil pressure gauge back
by the engine and here is what readings I got.
After about 10 mins of running, in driveway
At 2000rmps 27psi
at 1000rpms 14psi
Thats just about normal right?

It sounds so smooth now, I just love it.
Tomorrow will be the road test if I can find a
12point socket thingy for the cv joint bolts.
Excuse my none technical terms ;)

I'll post again tomorrow with more news
I'am so excited!!
