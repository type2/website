Subject: mystery wire?

Hi!  I am just about done installing a rebuilt 2.0 liter in a 78 bus.   
However, there is a little 2&quot; wire with a spade end on it coming from 
the little box on the firewall on the passenger side above # 1 behind 
the breather.   A plug goes in the box from the wire loom running along 
the tin from #2  and the wire comes out from the plug.   What should 
that connect to?   Sorry if this doesn't make any sense?
