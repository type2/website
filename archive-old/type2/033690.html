&gt; Very cool--but what IS a 'radarvehicle'?

That's a vehicle parked beside the road to measure the speed of passing
cars. If one exceeds the speed limit it will be photographed.

&gt; Also--since I can't read Dutch--what on earth is the phrase &quot;playboy van&quot;
&gt; doing in the middle of Paragraph 4??

Before you get the wrong idea, this article really isn't that
interesting to translate it completely. The Dutch word 'van' means
'from' in English. It has nothing to do with a VW bus. An old policeman
is telling about the old-days. He remembers that the Porsche-driving
police officers were the Playboys of the police department. They felt
they were better than the rest. (Todays the motorcycle-cops have taken
thier place in that perspective)

&gt; Note to other viewers--while I did get the picture to load, I had to be
&gt; patient and click the reload button more than once.

That's weird, I normally only have that problem with Hotmail and Yahoo.
