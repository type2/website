Subject: Re: [T2] Re: locking gas cap

From: &quot;Christopher Renz&quot; &lt;midwestbass_at_hotmail_dot_com&gt;
&gt; Bimmerparts_dot_com is where I got mine. The stock style locking one, and a
&gt; real Pita to get on when the tank is full.

The one at AutoZone appears to be the same size as the other locking one,
though it's high-impact plastic rather than metal.  But it's nicely done,
and the black coloring looks good.

It presses easily into place, doesn't turn, and the seal seems to be tight.
When you turn the key the cap pops out a little bit and easily removes.  I
would suppose that over time the seal might not be quite as &quot;poppy&quot; as it is
in new condition.

I tend to view locking gas caps as the same as the locks on my home's front
door.  They're there to help keep honest people honest, and to give cowardly
thieves the impression that it'll take too long to steal and that they'll
risk being caught.  Determined thieves are going to take what they want.

At least my bus doesn't have an exposed filler neck like my Sentra.  Just
under the car next to the tank, you can loosen a rubber hose and access the
fuel tank.  I know this to be true, I did this to move fuel from the car to
the bus.  Really dumb design IMHO.

You know, a friend of mine had a security system in his car that required
that you have certain normal controls on the dash, like the heater, radio,
etc., set a certain way before the car would start.  Anyone familiar with
this?  (This car also had a radar detector concealed in the functional
radio.)
