Subject: Fw: [T2] Thermostat- to fit or not to fit?

 Don't forget the thermostat flaps do more than restrict the air flow to a
 cold engine!!
 Once they are fully open, in a type 1 motor the flaps help direct the air
 from the fan shroud down over the heads and barrels and not just
circulating
 inside the fan shroud. In a type 4 motor the flap on the 3 &amp; 4 cylinder
side
 directs air through the oil cooler (the oil cooler gets no cooling air
 without that flap).
 They are an integral part of the cooling systems and should not be left
out.
