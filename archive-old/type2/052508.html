Subject: [T2] Re: Bending brake line

Regarding bending brake line. Bending new steel line is fine if:
You don't bend it back and forth several times. It will get brittle and break.
you keep the curves smooth, and don't allow it to kink. To do this you need to
support it with your thumbs and try to bend it smoothly, or use a tubing bender.
You don't try to bend it in too tight a curve.

Bending older rusted line is iffier. The same rules apply as above, and you have to be even more gentle.
Still try to bend old line as little, and gently as possible, because the rust pits
make it more prone to kinking, or tearing.
In my opinion a kinked brake line is ruined, and must be replaced.
