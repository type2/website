Subject: Re: [T2] Exhaust leak...

If you have visible smoke from the vents, does it match the color and smell of
the exhaust from the tail pipe?

If it smells more like the hot engine after its turned off, I'd guess it was
oil, and or crud.  I have found in several sets of used heater boxes a lot of
oily crud. It can be washed out of the heater air passages with a self serve car
wash or a steam cleaner.  Prior to that, I also got quite an odor from some of
the boxes.   Usually it would cook its way gone.   In their location as the
outside wall of the pushrod tube area, and proximity to the valve covers, they
could be exposed to oil contamination.

If it is exhaust, however, take no chances. Carbon Monoxide is an odorless and
colorless gas.  It will put you to sleep and kill you, and anyone with you.  One
of the symptoms is a reddening of the skin, and complaint of headache.  Others
on the list are more qualified to expand on what to look for as symptons.  You
could have an emissions shop place their probe at the vent to see if deadly
gases are present.

Keep smiling,

Mike
