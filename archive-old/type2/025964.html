Hi Volks,

I'd like to open an invitation for any Toronto Ontario area  list-members to
join the Yahoo Bugpack Mailing list* at The Docks Drive-In this Friday, July
6th.  Meet us at Cherry Beach for a BBQ, we'll be gathering there at about
6:30 until the gates at the Drive-in open at 8. They opened this drive-in
three weeks ago, right at the waters edge in the wharfs area of Downtown
Toronto.

I'm not sure what the movies will be, but it's only $13 ($Cdn) for adults,
and kids 12 and under are free. Seniors get in for $6.50.

See www.thedocks_dot_com for directions, and P-Mail me if you need more info.

Happy trails,

Greg Potts

* The BugPack list is a S. Ontario VW  list, we're heavily bus-oriented.
Last count has at least 6 Buses going to be there.
