Subject: Westy Tent

I went to the Manassas Bug Out over the weekend and there was a nice '72
Westy with a beautiful original canvas drive away tent:-) I am now
really wanting one myself. Anyone have one they just don't use? I would
love to buy one for my Westy. If anyone has any leads in future let me
know please. Other than the usual online auctions...

Peace

Meg
