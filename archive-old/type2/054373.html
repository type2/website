&gt; I've been pretty much a lurker so far because, well, I haven't actually

huh?!  I suggest you find an honest mechanic.

&gt; haven't given me a price yet. They said they would pull the engine and try

&gt; what I'm looking at. I'm going to talk to them tomorrow.

don't let em pull the motor. rent a garage and take it there and work on
it yourself.  I suspect you got a wire crossed or accidently pulled
something else apart while putting in the new switch, very easy to do

&gt; 
&gt; So, what should I ask? Is it reasonable that the bus ran fine, was towed 
&gt; here, I replaced the ignition switch, it wouldn't start, was towed there, and 
&gt; now needs a new engine?? I guess stranger things have happened when it comes 
&gt; to VWs :~)

yes stranger things have happened, but I wouldn't put that as your first
problem.

I forget is yours a fuel injected or carburated.  there is a problem that
occurs with Fuel injected vans that keeps the fuel pump from operating.

the reason I suspect there is &quot;something afoot&quot; at your mechanics because
you said the engine &quot;cranked but wouldn't fire&quot;  if it cranks it is going
all the way around.

there is quite a bit of information in the library on how to check out
your engine.  take it step by step, I suspect a minor problem in the
ignition system.

good luck
Bob
