&gt; I had a continental tire disintigrate on me last aug.... on the way to Buses of

&gt; but we didn't suffer any wild ride... no excitement... I just steered to the
&gt; shoulder,, and brought it to a controlled stop.

I've had the same experience a couple of times.  Tread peeled off, but bus
ran true.  Now if I had been going around a corner at the time...

One time I was going down I-5 on my motorcycle and smelled tire smoke.  I
came up behind a Toyota sedan that had smoke coming from the right rear
tire.  Pulled up and gestured at the driver, and after she decided that I
wasn't a deranged maniac she pulled over.

On closer inspection, she was driving on two sidewalls.  The tread was
completely gone!  The tire was one of the &quot;superfiller&quot; variety with
reinforced sidewalls, and the sidewalls were supporting the car!  The
driver said that the car had been &quot;feeling a little funny&quot; for the last 20
miles or so!  After the tire and rim cooled to the point where I could
touch it, I changed the tire and she went on her way.
