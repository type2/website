Brian,

I'll bet you that the sound is coming from a dry rubbing block on the
points. Pop your distributor cap, and look at the lobes that touch the
points. If they are dry as a bone, that's what's causing the sound. do NOT
use regular grease or Vaseline; Bosch makes a special grease for this
application (and for the input shaft bearing) that won't fly out onto your
points.

If you have a magnetic trigger, then I don't know what I'm talking about.
