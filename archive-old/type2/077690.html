&gt; Didn't early splitties use a cable operated off-on-reserve valve like the bugs? It

yup

&gt; wouldn't just bolt on, but it sure would be sweet. Probably have to braze the pickup

doubt it would fit a bay

&gt; Otherwise, there has to be some electrical type used on boats.

nothing in the West Marine catalog, which is the only one I have handy

&gt; &gt; I like the idea of the spring loaded, solenoid tripped valve, it could
&gt; &gt; have a cable pull override if the solenoid failed,   they work on
&gt; &gt; diesel should work on gasoline.

&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; How about a vacuum solenoid so there was no electricity involved? Vacuum
&gt; &gt; &gt; holds it open, no vacuum, no open. Would require an electric something to
&gt; &gt; &gt; open it at engine start for the fuel injected engines.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; The other way would be to use the vacuum to close the valve in case of
&gt; &gt; &gt; emergency. Hmmm. Bet this version would fail when it was needed the most.
