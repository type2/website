Subject: Thanks/bye

Thanks, y'all for responses on my bad vibes.  I'm inclined to think it might
be the steering damper or weird road surfaces, as several suggested, because
I know it's not: tires, ball joints, wheel balance, etc.   And that being
the case, my mind is at east and I'm gonna go an' have that beer now...

After I sign off for the next couple of weeks, that is.
