&gt; OK i have a big prob well not huge but i can't drive at nite. My headlights 
&gt; don't work. All other lights work just not the headlights. If someone could 
&gt; lead me in the right direction to fix them it would be great. Yes the bulbs 
&gt; are good. Thanks

Wiggle your fuses!  Don't laugh, it cured the &quot;one-eyed monster&quot; for me
