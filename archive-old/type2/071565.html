Subject: New Devon article---who is this guy?
Content-type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII
Content-transfer-encoding: 7bit

    My cousin, a Morris Minor freak, just sent me a  xerox of an article from
a British car rag.  It's a one-page &quot;review&quot; of the new Brazilian Devon
conversions currently available in the U.K. (titled &quot;The Noise from Brazil&quot;).
Some humo(u)rless hun-yak named Hilton Holloway COMPLETELY slags it, and all
things air-cooled that we know and love. He fails to understand the vibe so
completely that it makes for very funny reading, plus there are a few cool
pictures (plaid door panels!)
     Anyway, I'm attempting to scan it, and anyone who'd like a copy, just hit
the reply button, and I'll try to attach it as a file.  Quality will be poor,
as it is a copy of a copy.
