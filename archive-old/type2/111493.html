Subject: Re: [T2] More about the child's cot (hammock)

All the bay cot canvas is the same size.  But they do shrink.....
The bars are different lengths:
68-73 are 56 1/4&quot; long.
74-75 are 57 1/4&quot; long.
76-79 are two piece collapsible, but the 74-75 will fit.... you just won't
 have a place to store them.
The half moons are mounted higher up on the A and B pillars on 68-73 
buses.

&gt;I'll be....  how does that work?
&gt;Do they twist or something to collapse??&lt;&lt;
&gt;
&gt;Frank, yes, on the later models (i'm sure someone will know
&gt;exactly which years) each pole was made out of 2 pieces
&gt;of metal. one was just skinnier than the other &amp; it worked
&gt;like a slide to adjust the width.  as the scanned image
&gt;suggests, this was to accomodate storage under the z-bed
&gt;in a specially designed slot.
&gt;
&gt;my first bus, a '74 Westy, had this feature.
