&gt; Hello!
&gt; 
&gt; I am looking for a vw bus and I noticed that you
&gt; have a few for sale.  I was
&gt; wondering if you know where I could actually find a
&gt; bus that is older.  I am
&gt; looking for a 52-67.  I love the older body style
&gt; and I am looking for the
&gt; camper van, but it's not necessary.  Could you
&gt; please tell me where these buses
&gt; you have for sale are?  I am in Ontario Canada and I
&gt; was wondering (if I was
&gt; serious about any of them) where I would have to
&gt; travel.  Could you give me any
&gt; additional information on the 72 bus, the 73 and the
&gt; 78(camper) models?  It
&gt; would be greatly appreciated.
&gt; 
&gt; Thank you for your time.
