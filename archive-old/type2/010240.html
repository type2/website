The following is a suggested course of action for building a Type IV 
engine which, with proper maintenance (especially oil changes) will go 
100 K miles. I have the process spread out over a year here, but that 
time could be compressed or expanded.

First month				Cost: average $150

Find a short block. It may be in your bus, or in a junkyard, or in the 
classifieds. Because you are building a *fresh* engine, this is all that 
you are interested in. (It is helpful if it has a fan attached). 

Cost: Free to $100. Don't spend more than $100 bucks for a short block 
unless it is exceptionally clean and has a lot of useful stuff attached 
to it.

Tear the short block down, labeling all the parts in bags. Take the case, 
the crankshaft, the camshaft, flywheel, and the connecting rods to a machine 
shop that specializes in VW engines. There, have these parts cleaned and 
measured for wear. Make a note of the measurements for the camshaft, 
crankshaft, and rods, and set these aside. If the case needs to be align 
bored, have that done this month. Cost: $75-150.

Meanwhile, clean all the small parts from the short block -- lifters,
relief valve, and so on. 


Second month				Average cost: $165

Buy a new clutch cover and pressure plate. If your crankshaft has been 
ground before or is bend in any way, get a new (reground) crankshaft.

Meanwhile, assemble a collection of correct engine tin, clean and paint 
it (or set asside for powder coating).


Third month				Average cost: $300

Take or ship your crankshaft, fan and hub, flywheel, clutch and cover to 
a machine shop. Have them regrind the crankshaft and then balance the 
unit (fan, shaft, clutch and flywheel). Cost increases as you approach 
the demand for zero-balance.

Meanwhile, study Tom Wilson.


Fourth month				Average cost: $200 minimum

Purchase some measuring tools -- ideally, a micrometer and a dial 
indicator. Have fun learning how to use them. Then measure and inspect 
all of the remaining moving parts in the short block: camshaft, lifters, 
distributor drive shaft, etc. Decide whether you intend to replace any of 
these.

Meanwhile, order correct sizes of main bearings, camshaft bearings, and 
rod bearings.


Fifth month				Average cost: $300

Order new pistons and cylinders (see archives for recommended sources). 
When you get them, clean and paint the cylinders (see archives, 
especially John Anderson's long message). Check wrist pin fit to rod 
bushings. Re-bush rods now if needed. 

Balance pistons and rods separately, and as units.


Sixth month				Average cost: $150

Purchase a complete gasket kit, case sealer, locktite, plastigage, etc. 
Follow instructions in Wilson and assemble case.

Bolt in new oil pump. There's no point scrimping on the cost of the oil pump.

Stuff all openings with lint-free material. (George Lyle, I think, uses 
plastic grocery bags).


Seventh month				Average cost: $400

Purchase either: two rebuilt heads (see archives) or one new head.

That's it for the month, unless you feel confident and want to blueprint 
the head(s)


Eighth month				Average cost: $400

This is only if you are purchasing new heads.

Now: take your time measuring compression ratio. Make decisions about 
cylinder shims. Finally, assemble the pistons, cylinders, and bolt on the 
heads.


Ninth month				Average cost: $150

Now you are making progress. Buy a new oil cooler and bolt it on. Also, 
loosely attach oil filter. If you've taken care of your cooling tin, 
attach it now. Begin assembling parts of the fuel injection system.


Tenth month				Average cost: $100

Finish assembling the engine and install it in the engine compartment. 
Hook up all wiring and vacuum hoses. If you haven't already done so, 
replace all fuel hose NOW.

Start the engine and begin to tune it. Follow Wilson's directions for 
break-in. Change the oil after starting, after 25 miles, and at 300 miles 
(if you get that far this month).


Eleventh month				Average cost: $50

At three hundred months, drop the engine, remove the cover tin, retorque 
the heads, replace the engine. Drive with increased confidence.

Twelfth month

You are done. Celebrate.
