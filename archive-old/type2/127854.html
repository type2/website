Subject: eltronic igniton problems

Ok sorry about not giving the full story about the igniton and type of buss im working on so here it goes. i just got done rebuilding my 83air cooled westy about a week ago and i go to start it and i have no spark.i take the coil wire off the distrubutor and turn the key and no spark. so  i take the coil off of (84 saab)and i have to sort of rig ti into the buss turn the key and i get spark. so  i go buy a new coil $70.00 at the parts house. anyhoo i plug the new coil in and no spark. At this point im  so frustrated i have to take some time to think.                                    so what i think happend is . when i put the coil from the (saab) in the buss i got spark becouse the(saab)dosent have a hall sensour and the coil didnt need one to spark.so when i put the new coil in it needs the hall seneour to spark thats  why the new coil dosnt spak and the (saab)s did. thats why i think its the hall sensor. I hope im right becuse i had to ordered a new one and it costed me $110.00
 and its on order so i dont even have it yet what do you peopl think abut this problem?......thanks matty
