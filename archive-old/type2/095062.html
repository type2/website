Subject: Re: Fw: [T2] Compression test

Compression Testers,

Remember, disconnecting the coil or using a remote starter switch cause the 
coil and injectors to be disabled (no injection, no vapors, no spark). The 
cold start is not disabled (maybe some vapor) and the pump will run (builds 
up pressure). If you have a leaky injector you may get some fuel into the 
intake as the fuel line pressure is up.

Chuck
