&lt;&lt; I am thinking about building a barn to put my VW stuff and a couple of

busses in. It seems to me this would be a good time to dig a &quot;pit&quot; to be

able to stand and work rather than work on my back on the floor. Anyone know

how deep to dig the thing or have any other input?

Scout the local want ads...Ask at the gas stations if anyone is up grading
their lift...But try and avoid a &quot;pit&quot;. They collect oil, debris, water, and 
ex-
haust gases...Need steps (A ladder? C'mon), a lighting system and only al-
low working on the center area underneath a vehicle...No suspension work
without a jack or jacks. etc. An electric lift is the way to go and locked up;
leaves another space for a car underneath...
