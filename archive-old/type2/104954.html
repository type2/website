[chuckle] Talk about being caught in a time paradox...

I've been all over trying to find VW fuses, the old-style ceramic,
multi-colored darlings that I used in all of my VW's two decades ago.  I'd
given away all of my old VW fuses a few years ago to someone with a Beetle
who needed them.

I couldn't find them; not at WalMart, etc..

Went into my Friendly Local Auto Parts Store, didn't see the fuses and asked
if they knew where I could get them from.  The clerk showed me a variety
pack of the new GBC-style fuses.  Granted, he didn't know that they also
carried packs of the individual GBC fuses, but at least he was knowledgeable
enough to help me graduate to the new fuses (new to me, at least).

Next time in WalMart I'll look for the GBC-style fuses, but I bought a pack
of each size from the FLAPS just to make sure that I had some on hand.

Interesting thought, the FLAPS clerk mentioned that the glass-encased
GBC-style fuses were safer than the older style because it was possible for
the older style fuse to act as an igniter if it blew while there were
volatile fumes in the vehicle.

Is this another S.H.T.I.C.K., or based in fact?
