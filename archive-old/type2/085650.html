Subject: jumpseat out of pre-72 style westy

 
--Don't even have to deal with it, as my camper is a 76, but are those seats technically safe for highway travel? Never seen one, honest question.

Billy






and I will need more seating.  Anyone have a rear facing 71
style jumpseat that needs a new home
