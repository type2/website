Subject: Re: [T2] Friday topic.....bus encounters not FS

This is a good topic, 

My entire VW experience evolved from a situation quite
similar.  My bus is a 73' Westy that my brother
watched for about eight years or so.  It was perfect
and slowly decayed into a weed and rodent condo :-) 
He did some research and found that it had been stolen
from a guy who had had it for a few weeks and the
carbs stripped off of it.  He ran the plates and got
the title from the insurance company, then had to
&quot;resteal&quot; it from the farmer who was trying to sell it
to him to cover &quot;storage fees&quot;... go figure :-)

I brought her back from the dead in 99' and have been
using her as my daily driver for three years now. 
It's been an education that I never would have
imagined getting!  

The only thing that is cooler than being a bus pilot
is geting to know all the other VW folk in their
various states of mind and circumstance.  Overall I've
found everyone to be extremely generous, intelligent
and open (not like the folks I knew in my dads British
car clubs at all, bunch of snotty uptight pretentious
people).

Happy Friday!

&gt; Hi all,
&gt; 
&gt;      Had to jump in on this thread.  About 4 years
&gt; ago, a rather nice 68-71 
&gt; Westy showed up on the outskirts of town.  This
&gt; thing looked great.  It was 
&gt; parked at a farm, next to the barn, but visible from
&gt; the road. 
&gt;     A few weeks later, we noticed that that bus
&gt; never moved.  We stopped and 
&gt; talked to the owner, and he said he went &quot;down
&gt; south&quot; to get a clean rust 
&gt; free bus, so he would have something solid to work
&gt; with.  Shortly after he 
&gt; trailered it up here (Wisconsin), the motor quit
&gt; running, so there the bus 
&gt; sat. 
&gt;     Fast forward to a few months ago.   Bus is STILL
&gt; sitting in the same 
&gt; spot, outside, and when I stopped by to inquire
&gt; about the bus, the owner had 
&gt; the same attitude as the previous story.....&quot;Does it
&gt; SAY for sale on it?!? I 
&gt; am sooo sick of you (----) people stopping
&gt; here.....&quot;  and on and on.
&gt; 
&gt;        I did manage to sneak a peak at that bus
&gt; before I was tossed off the 
&gt; property.   What was once a gorgeous bus, is going
&gt; downhill fast.  Sitting 
&gt; outside after 4 years on a farm, through 4 wisconsin
&gt; winters, and, to make 
&gt; matters worse, all of the runoff from the roof of
&gt; the barn lands directly on 
&gt; the bus...you can only imagine.
&gt; 
&gt;    What prompts some people to do this, to what was
&gt; once a great bus?
&gt;    
&gt;      Misunderstanding some folks.
