Hey all,

I need some input on this problem.

'79 deluxe Westy, dual battery system.  We have a regular battery as the
main/starting battery and a new deep cycle battery as the aux.  The
batteries are separated by a relay, which is connected to the + side of the
coil.  So the batteries are isolated from each other when the key is off but
when the ignition is turned on, the relay closes and the batteries are
joined together so that both can be charged by the alternator.

I have found that basically everything in my van including the Westy
lighting is wired to run off the main battery.  The PO added some accessory
12v sockets in the back which are wired off the aux batt, and the fridge is
powered off the aux batt.

Here's the deal.  I drove the van Saturday and Sunday, no problems.  I went
to start it yesterday, and it wouldn't start.  The engine turned over very
slowly and it wouldn't catch, classic dead battery symptom.  Got a jump
start from my Mercedes diesel (now THAT'S a battery) and it fired right up.

Did my errands, started each time (the alternator is charging the batteries
just fine), came home.  Couldn't do much troubleshooting because everything
was working then.  Did pull the fuses one by one with everything off and see
if there was a drain anywhere, but the only place I found one was on fuse 8,
because the driver's door was open and that's the fuse the interior light is
on.  Turned off the light and the drain went away.

The only thing I can think of that is drawing any current with the power off
is the memory function on my Kenwood stereo.  It's fused separately so I
didn't see that draw when I checked the fusebox.

So just now I went to check on the Bus.  Here's what I found, before
attempting to do anything:  aux battery at a nice 12.3v.  Main battery at a
low 11.6v.  So they are indeed isolated from each other.  Turned the key on,
main battery stayed at 11.6v, aux battery dropped to about that level,
indicating they are now joined and the low main battery is drawing some
juice from the aux.  Turned the key back off and after a few minutes the aux
was back up to 12v or so.

Disconnected the ground on the main battery and measured the current
flowing.  I read 180mA being drawn, with everything off.  Is this in line
with the memory function on a stereo or is something else drawing power?  I
don't know if that's a sufficient draw to drain the battery so quickly or if
that's practically insignificant current draw for the battery to be drained
in a period of less than 24 hours.

BTW, yesterday I checked current draw on the aux battery with everything off
and it was a solid 0.

I'm thinking it may be time for a new main battery, if this one just isn't
holding a charge but before I rush out and buy one I want to see if 180mA is
an inappropriate amount of current draw.

Any thoughts?

Thanks!
