Considering LA traffic, is there any interest in a get-together in the
vicinity around 3:00 or so to shoot the bull before the event?

Any good tourist attractions around the City of Industry (Why am I
thinking of the movie Metropolis?)

Hope the weather cools off a bit.  The number on the outdoor thermometer
is currently 109.  Not unusual for the Arizona folks, but where I am it is
a bit high.  17% humidity, though, and the air coming out of the swamp
cooler is 75 degrees.
