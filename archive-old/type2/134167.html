Subject: Thanks to all who helped.

I just got my new alternator in. Thanks to everyone who helped out with
advice, especially Tom. Also John C at ACN for helping me with the
product he sold me. Because I had no idea where the bolts to mount the
fan shroud where ended up pulling the engine to do it. Thus concluded my
first solo engine pull/install. Still took about 7 hours but it's done
right.
 
I also got my seatbelt in for my daughters car seat. Thanks again to
everyone who helped me find where they mount. I was too busy looking at
the floor to see the mounts up above just below the seat. Special thanks
to John Kolak for all his help as well as the pics he dug up.
 
Thanks again. If it wasn't for the advice I got on the list, I never
would have tried this on my own.
