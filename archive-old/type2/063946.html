Subject: Bad mileage

OK, this isn't technically about a type 2, but I own and operate a type 2 so 
I believe I am qualified for any help you knowledgeable folks could pass 
along.

Here's the problem: my '73 bug gets horrible gas mileage (15-17 mpg in the 
city). Here's what I've done to try and remedy the problem:
1) Installed Pertronix ignitor--actually increased gas mileage 4 mpg; that's 
right, I was getting 11-12!!
2) new plugs
3) timing set statically and dynamically
4) fiddled endlessly with the Pict 34. Not uninformed fiddling either. I 
followed the directions of St. Muir, Sir Bentley and Dr. Hoover. No, the 
choke isn't sticking closed.
5) Installed a rebuilt PICT 34, which refused to idle on said vehicle.
6) Made sure there are no obstructions in the air cleaner

This is a rebuilt engine with about 40,000 miles on it. Been awhile since I 
checked the compression, but as I recall it was OK, with the typical dip in 
the No. 3 reading. Engine doesn't burn oil, but leaks a bit. Exhaust smells 
rich.

Here's my thought: this engine is just getting old. Perhaps compression 
isn't what it used to be, maybe the rings and valves aren't sealing as they 
did in their youth. Kinda frustrating, though. I could be driving a 73 
Cadillac and get the same mileage. So much for the image of the 
environmentally conscious VW owner.
