&gt; Richard's bus is a '78 Westy, with a new FI engine.  As I understand

in the exhaust stream as well, so am thinking that the motor may be a 
'79... ??... 

I've owned a CA '79 Westy and a CA '78 Westy. 

The O2 sensor on a '79 does indeed go into the exhaust system, on the 
driver's side, just upstream of the U-turn that goes in to the cat 
converter. The wire goes into the harness that goes to the FI &quot;brain.&quot;

There are other substantive differences between the '78 and '79 engine: 
on the '79 engine the exhaust manifold is rectangular where it bolts onto 
the heads. On the '78 and all other pancake engines, the exhaust 
manifolds have round ports. If you took off the lowest piece of tin 
covering the heads and looked up there with a flashlight you could 
probably see the difference with the engine in.  

Also I'm pretty sure that the '79 does not have a EGR valve or 
recirculation pipe. Looking into the engine from the rear a CA '78 engine 
has a prominent, silver colored pipe that comes up through the tin and 
goes to the EGR valve, a gizmo that attaches to the plenum from the 
driver's side and is actuated by a spring-loaded lever that goes over to 
the throttle. I'm pretty sure the '79 dispensed with this when they added 
the O2 sensor. Can others confirm this assertion?

Anyways, Richard should check the exhaust manifolds to confirm what he's 
driving. Maybe he's just got a '79 exhaust system on a '78 engine. If 
it's really a '79 there should be a loose electrical connector somewhere 
on the electrical harness for the FI system. The O2 sensor connects to 
that. If it's a '78, there will be nowhere to connect it to. 

O2 sensors need to be replaced periodically too. I don't know how to tell 
when one is dead nor how much new ones cost.

As for mileage, I didn't find a huge difference in mileage between my '78 
and my '79. OTOH, one was a manual tranny and the other was an automatic 
and the difference between those two could exceed 3mpg. 

In any case, gas mileage will be optimized if he has the fuel mixture 
sensitively adjusted with the aid of an exhaust gas analyzer. And run the 
right tires at the right pressure, drive 55mph, shed excess weight, etc. 
etc. 

Your actual mileage may vary.
