Subject: Look out for me going to Tom F.'s Xmas party

I have decided to drive the 67 to Tom's party.  I have
done a tuneup and put in an 009, brakes work but not
the greatest.  Should be good to go and the bus needs
to meet some friends.  Would take the 75 but the
brakes are toast.  I will be going 50 to 495 around
1ish if grad school stuff goes well. Any Annapolitans
want to catch a ride? Hope to meet some listees.  As a
Friday topic did anyone see the VH1 Rock Memoribilla
thing w/the Beattles shop in VA Beach.  They showed a
shot of John and Yoko's camper.  Looked like it could
have been a splitty but the interior was not
Westfalia, at least from what I briefly saw.  

Take Care,
Flynn
