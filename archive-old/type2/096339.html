yes you just slide it thru when the rocker assembly is removed

yes you should probably adjust the valves

no the lifters are adjusted completely differently, read it in Bentley but
basically turn the lifter in until it touches the pushrod, then take an
additional (officially) 2 turns in tighter to preload the hyd cam
followers, most people take 1-1.5 turns.  

easy job, use the newer viton seals on the pushrod tubes
