Subject: Re: [T2] 215 vs 210mm in a 1973 3-rib transmission

&gt; Here's a dumb question... will a 215mm clutch and flywheel fit in a

Not a dumb question really,,, but going by the fact the 215mm flywheel uses the same starter as
the 210mm.. I would say that you will have no problems
The ring gear is the same size, the disc is slightly larger

Even though you didn't ask about the 228mm, The 228mm requires a different starter because the
ring gear is also bigger, thus a bigger opening in the bellhousing

and as you can interchange all this stuff,, it doesn't really matter how many ribs are on the trans
091 or the 002 body doesn't dictate the flywheel,, the bellhousing does.
hope that helps
