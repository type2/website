&gt; I believe one should seriously consider the effect of posting such a
&gt;message on a list of 1000 subscribers could have on a small specialized


Yeah, like producing results.

&gt; Although this list should not infringe upon someone's first amendment
&gt;rights,  I believe there should be some policy concerning the use of the
&gt;list to post negative comments which surely have a far reaching effect on
&gt;someone's livelihood.


WAHHH, officially that is, naivete on this order usually goes out with
adulthood.  Frankly I've held my tongue but the original poster was right in
what they did and this homage goes a bit too far.  I've said many times, I
order all my stuff from Ron, I don't know over a $1000 in the last 2 years
at least, his prices are great, but recently his service could use some
work.  Bus Depot seldom if ever bothers to drop an email telling if
something will be backordered or giving the status of such later.  In fact
they don't always seem to even acknowledge emails period, for that reason
I've been largely scared to try the online ordering myself.  I have however
always PERSONALLY found Ron to advise of shipping issues and even to arrange
drop shipment from suplliers for faster service.  But I and others I've
talked to recently have had a few trivial errors, I mean trivial but the
kind &quot;some people&quot; would have jumped all over Parts Place or Bus Boys for
3-4 years ago.  So my message, keep on ordering from Bus Depot and don't
give up after one marginaly bad experience, most will be far better.  But
for those who find it real easy to say &quot;well you should have ordered it
further ahead of time&quot; BS we've all been there, or any real person has.  If
you ordered it, gave explicit instructions and were prepared to pay for
expedited shipping (which again you usually don't need from Bus Depot) and
were doubly prepared to pay shipping as needed for two shipments, you should
have had it shipped as expected.  Expecting less is ludicrous and griping
about it is warranted.  The purpose of this list isn't to foster a bunch of
warm fuzzy pansy ass touchy feely goodness.  Ron put his hat into the public
arena a few years ago and has dealt with far worse ever since as is the
consequence of running any business.  Honest and factual airing of problems
are VERY MUCH in the spirit of this list and have been since the very
beginning.  Those who have an honest gripe about ANYONE can and should
complain, that is how things improve.  But if they have any balls they
should also feel morally obligated to tell how situations are rectified,
admit if they were at fault or wrong, and if sensible to give anyone a
second chance for an honest mistake.
