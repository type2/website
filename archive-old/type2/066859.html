This weekend I am planning on installing a new starter in the Westy.
Are there any hints, tips, suggestions ya'll have before I tackle the
job?

Also, is there a way to do this without removing the engine, or should I
pull it, and be done with it?

So I wrote:
No need to pull the engine, Dave!

It might help to jack up the rear passenger side and remove rear
passenger side tire though.

There are lots of wires going to the starter. Carefully label them all,
looking at your new starter (in the hand, convenient) to draw a picture
and label where everything on the old starter (helluv hard to see
up there) goes. Disconnect all.

The thing is held in by two bolts. The bottom one (a bolt into a threaded
fitting in the bell housing of the tranny) is pretty easy to
reach from below. The top one is helluv difficult to reach. As I recall, it's
a bolt that comes out towards the front of the bus, passes through an unthreaded
hole in the bell housing of the tranny, and comes out inside the engine
compartment near the accelerator butterfly where it is held by a big nut.
It definitely helps to have a second pair of hands (attached to a patient
friend, perhaps) working inside the engine compartment through the top
access hatch to hold the nut motionless while you turn the bolt from
under the car with much gnashing of teeth and falling of grit in eyes (wear eye
protection!).

Get those out, and the starter lifts right out. Then do it all in reverse
to install the new one.

I met a guy who says lots of VW bus owners don't ever replace the top
bolt (the tough one). He said one bolt is enough to hold the starter
securely. I am very skeptical though. Anyone else out there in type2 land
driving with only one bolt holding their starter in?

You can do the job in under an hour, but it's kind of a hassle. It would be
easy to do with the engine out, but it takes MUCH longer to drop that
2.0L engine than it does to do the starter with engine in.

Have at it!
