Subject: RE: Unknown knobs on the 74 Westy

&gt;It's green, on the passenger side, and it has a diagram of a
&gt; coil on it.  Neat, but I wonder what else it does.

Busy day for knobs: It's for the rear window defroster. (more correctly
it supplies power to it. whether it still conducts enough current to
defrost after 25 years is a different question)
