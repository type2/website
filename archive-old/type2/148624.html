Subject: Re: [T2] 78 Bay Drum Brake Q?

&lt;yes, and yes.  I did rebuild the cylinders as well, and bled the
entire system completely.&gt;

Okay, I'd re-bleed the system soon. I always seem to get a bubble more after a drive or two. 

&lt;It's a different set up than Im used to seeing.  There are several of
the &quot;usual&quot; components missing.  Well, maybe not missing, but not
there.  Like the pins that come thru the backing plate and then thru
the brake shoe with the round clip/washer and spring.  There is also
no ebrake adjuster on the stars.&gt;

Okay things are missing that you've seen on other cars or things missing from your reference picture in your Bentley manual? As I recall there are supposed to be pins but it has been a while since I've seen rear brakes on a VW bus (mine hasn't racked up many miles in the past few years. Actually it hasn't racked up ANY miles in the past few years.... &lt;grin!&gt;). True that there are not any automatic adjusters on the rear brakes so if you are used to seeing the rear brakes of say a Mustang, then yeah, it'll be different. Check out the book and then tell me if anything is missing. 

Re-adjust those rear brakes with the e-brake slack and then adjust the e-brake too afterwards. I'm jealous, I've got to re-build my whole system yet and you're almost done... &lt;grin!&gt;
