Subject: RE: [T2] Heat

My mistake! Sorry Andy. I looked at who started the thread, instead of who
started the conversation...

Man, I need another set of eyes, 10 years behind a computer is taking its
toll.

Cool that you will be pricing the Webastos. I got my info from Dave Smith
Motors in Kellogg Idaho when I helped my brother pick up a company truck
last Christmas. So my estimate was dealer retail, I am sure they are less
expensive direct.

They install the Webasto heaters in every diesel truck they ship to Alaska
and offer it as an option on their other trucks.

By the way, I'm also getting a price on the comparable Webasto models.
I think they may be a little less expensive than the Eberspaecher
units.-
