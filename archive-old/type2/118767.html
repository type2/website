Subject: Re: [T2] camshaft bearing

I'm curious.  How do you know your camshaft bearings need replacing?  These
bearings lead a relatively sheltered life and other parts of the engine are
more likely to go before these do.  Too, I'm under the impression that it's
difficult (impossible?) to diagnosis &quot;camshaft bearing problems&quot; with the
engine in the car since I'm not aware of a characteristic noise or whatever
that gives this problem away.

&gt; Looks like mine is going to be needing to be replaced.
&gt;
&gt; Anyone in Alberta / Saskatchewan who would like a friend forever
&gt; who would be willing to teach a newbie to tear a 1700 fi down?
&gt;
&gt; Is this something I could do with all the books I have?
