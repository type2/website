Subject: RE: [T2] RE: Help!  For anyone with Hankook tires on a
  Vanagon/Bubble  Bus

&gt; There's another consideration as well.  I put a set of these 
&gt; on my 80 Westy, and the handling got definitely squirrely on 
&gt; the highway, relative to the Michelins I had been running.  
&gt; With every side gust, it felt like the bus was going over.  
&gt; You might not like the effect.  I don't think I'd put another 
&gt; set on there now.
&gt; 
&gt; Also, one of them came apart on me on the highway with quite 
&gt; a bit of tread left, say, a half inch.  It could just have 
&gt; been a bad tire since it hasn't happened again on any of the others.


Something seems amiss here, as this description doesn't sound at all like
RA08's. They have a comparably stiff sidewall to the Michelins and shouldn't
be squirrely at all.  In fact the Type2, Vanagon, and Samba archives are
full of overwhelmingly positive reviews of them (many from people who
previously used Michelins or Conti's); I don't think there's even a single
other report of them being &quot;squirrely.&quot;  What's more I have never had a
single complaint from my customers (nor have I noticed this myself, having
used both Michelins and Hankooks extensively).  Are you sure you have the
RA08's?  185's or 195's? (A taller sidewall will have slightly more flex,
but with only a 1/2&quot; difference it shouldn't be as severe as feeling like
the bus would blow over on every wind gust.)  Did you inflate them properly?
(Compared to 205 series tires, 185's and 195's will require significantly
higher inflation; see your door jamb sticker.)  Did you take the one tire
back to your local Hankook dealer?  Did you make any other changes to your
van at the same time (i.e. shocks)?
