I'm not sure where this started or where it's going, but this is the
reason for the hose in the stand pipe---
It washes down the sides of the bowl when the pot is flushed---

Unless of course you have a tankless toilet the only uses high pressure
water to empty the bowl of it's contents.

Everyone knows this--right?

Later,

Terry

Toilet (US Version)
TGIF - I've been waiting a full week for this one!!

OK, I went to fix my toilet, and when I was replacing the flush
mechanism, I noticed that there was a hose that came out of the flusher
that fed water right down the drain pipe, directly into the bowl.
Wait a minute, this can't be right!! This is just throwing water into
the bowl, that was just emptied!! This has got to be a waste of water.
Why not move this hose so that it fills up the TANK instead of throwing
the water down the bowl?!?!?   This way, no water would be wasted, and
the tank would fill up a bit faster..
All right, you say. EVERY flusher in the USA has this small feed into
the bowl; it was designed by mechanical (water?) engineers that way; it
has been proven to work for a hundred years like that; if it was not
needed, then you can be sure that the toilet manufacturers would NOT
have spent the extra $.05 for the little hose!!

But wait a minute, I say. Isn't it possible that millions of people have
using a poorly designed flusher mechanism, and that I could have a new,
revolutionary idea. After all, I've been flushing toilets for more than
___ {&lt;-pick a number, I'm not going to give away age...} years now.
Don't I know first hand how it should work??
Toilet &lt;-&gt; type 2 = moral of the story, if you question the wisdom of
the designers of the type 2, and wish to make your own 'improvements',
remember to flush twice before looking... and be sure to join a good
auto club.
