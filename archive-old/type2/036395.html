Subject: Mexican combi

So many people are always talking about how they wish they could import a new 
bettle from Mexico ( as opposed to the New bettle )   I know there are 
several people doing that now but is anyone doing the same thing with the van 
? I went to the VW of Mexico web page you can click on english langauge and 
they have a page on the combi looks like the T2 type 2
