&gt;Martin,
&gt;  Sounds like the old &quot;voltage drop&quot; problem. I installed
&gt;a 12 volt relay back by the starter and operate it with the key. The 
relay
&gt;provides a short path from the battery to the starter. seems that 
long wire run
&gt;&gt;from the back to the front and all the way to the back again can 
cause problems.
&gt;I put this relay in 7 years ago and havent had the problem since. I 
got my
&gt;relay at my local Vdubb place.... they called it a &quot;hard start 
relay&quot;... I have heard of
&gt;people useing a ford starter relay too.
&gt;   let me know if you need info on how to wire it in... I can try 
and explain it after
&gt;I look at my schematic again.

Dan and Martin,
You can also find instructions for wiring in this hot start relay on 
my web site, http://www.digital-galaxy_dot_net/type2/bartnik/tech.htm -- 
I have installed the relay on two Buses I had and never had a hot 
start problem on either one after installing the relay.  I also have 
a couple articles on starter troubleshooting that might be helpful.

Good luck
