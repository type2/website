&gt;Hey Steve,
&gt;
&gt;It was nice to meet you at the swap meet last week.
&gt;
&gt;We were talking about moving the wheel in the AFM, did you say that when I
&gt;go sea level, I should move it clockwise or counterclockwise?  How many
&gt;clicks did you say?  Counterclockwise is richer, right?

I think clock wise  is tightening the spring so it would be leaner.  Can
anyone else on the list confirm this?  I'm no authority but  I wouldn't go
more than 3.
(Be sure to mark the reference point where it is now so you can return it
to this point if necessary).

&gt;Did you say you were going to Jerome this fall?

Planning on it.

Have fun
