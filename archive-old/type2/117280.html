I slow down nice and easy... around 40, they usually pass. The really
puzzling ones are when you're cruising late at night on an interstate, in
the middle of nowhere, and someone comes from way behind, and settles in
behind you, with no exit for ten miles coming, They're too lazy to pass,
and so they just sit there behind you. Several times, I've gone into the
next lane, and slowed down. They suddenly shoot forward and disappear into
the night. Makes you wonder...
