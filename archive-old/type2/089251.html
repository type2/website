Well, let me say this, on that:

I know Dan Kinsey to be one of the most meticulous (sp) people I know, 
and I'll bet he installed it right the first time. But, when he started 
the Binz up at 4 AM in front of my house, in our warm tropical climate, 
and started to drive away, he left a trail of oil 2-3 inches wide! Lou 
called him back on the two-way radio, and he pulled the FRAM filter off, 
and about an inch of the sealing gasket was crimped over, or destroyed, 
or wasn't there, whatever.

I have heard, many times on our lists that Fram filters are cr*p, and 
other name brand ones because they are made by the same cheap standards. 
Sure Fram filters are cheap to buy, and easy to find, but I think that's 
part of the problem. We keep buying the cheap ones, so they are 
plentiful, but we have to hunt down the good ones, such as the Bosch, 
and maybe pay a little more. But in the long run, which is the bargain: 
the cheap one that potentially could have destroyed Dan's engine, or ....

In my case, I bought a case of Bosch from Bus Depot 'when they were on 
sale,' so I had extras on hand when Dan needed one.

We put good oil in our engines because we know what's best for them, 
maintenance-wise, but does it make sense to skimp on the filter? You 
decide...

&gt;&gt; As they were driving off, I noticed a
&gt;&gt; puddle that didn't look like rain water, and when Dan checked it, it 
&gt;&gt; was
&gt;&gt; oil that his filter had spit out! The Fram's gasket had crimped, and he
&gt;&gt; was pouring out oil! Fortunately I had a Bosch oil filter, (Thanks Bus
&gt;&gt; Depot!) Dan installed it, with a quart of Valvoline (thanks Lou) and
&gt;&gt; they were on their way.
