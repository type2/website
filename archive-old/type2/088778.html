Hi folks,

For those who wants to take a look at how the Europeans organize and =
conquer shows should take a look at my site =
http://members.home.nl/bulli/ and click on to fotoalbum.=20

There you will find a photoreport of the show that took place in the =
southern part of the Netherlands last weekend.

I was there from friday afternoon till sunday evening and it was again =
an event i wouldn't miss for sure. As it is one of the biggest European =
shows the people come from all over Europe to attend. I even spoke to a =
man from Japan who mentioned that his early bay bus is still in Japan =
instead of at this show...... ;-)

Enjoy.....
