Subject: Re: Starting problems--temperature sensor #2?

&gt;  I'm awaiting delivery of a temp sensor #2 so
&gt; that I can figure out where it might fit, and
&gt; hopefully it will make a difference in the starting
&gt; and running of my 75 bus with a 79 engine.  Apparently
&gt; the #2 temp sensor is located in a different place on
&gt; later engines, which isn't mentioned in the Bentley or
&gt; Haynes manuals that I have.  Maybe in the Vanagon
&gt; manuals?

I am a little confused.... You are using a 79 engine with the 79 heads? And
you can't find temp sensor #2?  It is mounted on the head next to #3
cylinder intake port. Unless someone swapped the heads side-to-side, then it
would be next to #2 intake port.
Or are you using 75 heads?  If yes....you won't like where that sensor is!
It mounts on a 45 degree angle on top of the head between # 3 + # 4. It is a
major PITA to replace it.
I believe this is why it was only done in 74 and 75 up to 12/75. [74 Cal
w/auto trans had FI] Almost all 75-79 left upper cylinder tin have a round
grommet plugging a 1&quot; hole over the top of the head. This is for the 75 temp
sensor #2.
