I feel so dumb, and want to apologize for my last post about the 
&quot;gentle knock&quot;. The other day my friend and I were driving around in my
bus. I mentioned the knock and he said &quot;oh that's  your fire
exstinguisher not bolted down properly.&quot; oh..........

I think in the future I'm going to try really hard to figure out my
problem before posting-I dig yous  and all I just don't want to be
hasty, lazy and take up bandwidth. gee wiz I feel dumb.
