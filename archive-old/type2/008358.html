Subject: dies when braking

I finally got a new alternator in my '78 2.0 but now it dies when I pump 
the brakes. It wont die if I brake slowly and I can pump the brakes and 
kind of stop before it dies because I can hear it dieing slowly as I 
pump them. I figure its a vacuum leak and I think I can hear a leak but 
can't tell where its coming from. Any other possibilites or place to 
look for a leak? Thanks.

                                       Simon
