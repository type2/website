Subject: Re: [T2] heat shield &amp;amp;J River's trailer hitch

Mike,

I think it is more properly called a &amp;quot;modesty panel&amp;quot;...LOL!

It is attached to the bumper and very few busses seem to have one left 
after all the years.  A guy at the Eureka Springs show szeveral years ago 
commented on my bus having one and said that when he had them, he charged 
$75.00 for them....his prices are always hi tho.

Basically it just hides the muffler a little more from view from the rear.
It is not insulated or double walled in any way.

And yes, it does have to come off to get the hitch on.

Cheers, dave

&amp;gt; Lhiannon71 mentioned in commenting on install of J River's hitch that he 
&amp;gt; had to remove the &amp;quot;gravel shield&amp;quot; to fit the hitch-

&amp;gt; rack or trailer- the shield you mention I thought is an insulated heat 
&amp;gt; shield, not a gravel shield?  Wouldn't the lack of this make for a hot 
&amp;gt; engine compartment floor?
