Billy,

Chris Mills's recommendation of inserting a light bulb in series in the 
ground leg of the battery to check for a battery draining load hooked 
between the positive side of the battery to ground is quite correct.

1. Consider the case of a 0.5 ohm load connected from the positive side of 
the battery to ground. 24 amps would flow and the battery would drain over 
time.

2. If the battery ground strap is removed the current flow drops to zero.

3. If a 6 watt lamp bulb (12 volts at 0.5 amps, 24 ohms) is inserted between 
the battery negative terminal and ground a current of 12/24.5 (0.49) amps 
flows since the total series resistance is now 24 + 0.5 ohms.

4. The normally 6 watt bulb is now operating at 5.9 watts and is burning 
almost at its normal brightness. A voltmeter across the bulb would measure 
11.75 volts.

5. If an ammeter that can only safely measure up to 15 amps had been 
inserted into the ground leg instead it could be damaged or a meter fuse 
would have blown since 24 amps would flow. (The ammeter has a very low 
resistance).

6. If you are tracing battery drain problems put a 5 or 6 watt bulb in the 
in the ground leg. Measure the voltage across the bulb. If it is 6 volts or 
less you can use most ammeters with out the bulb since the drain current to 
be measured is less than approximately 0.5 amps.
