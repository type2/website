&gt; This is a stock 2.0L with fuel injection, 1980 air

&gt; more than two hours, sometimes run the battery down
&gt; trying to start it to get back home. Have changed the
&gt; fuel filter, the old one was clean, replaced the AFM,
&gt; no change , also replaced the eletronic brain, with no
&gt; change. Put new spark plugs and points also, still no

FUEL filter??
fuel presure??
