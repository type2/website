Subject: NEW Front Axle Beams!

I only have 3, so hurry!  This is the first time I've had them in 3
years!  (Some incorrect, Brazilian-spec ones surfaced in the interim -
not sold by me - which didn't fit properly.)

This is a whole new Genuine VW front beam, for a '71-79 Bus. Check yours
if you haven't recently. They're known for rusting out, which can be
very dangerous. Here on the east coast this has sent many busses to the
scrapyard, and good used beams are getting scarce. (Besides, replacing a
front axle beam is a pretty big job, not the kind of thing you want to
do twice. It's silly to go to all that effort only to install another 30
year old axle beam.)

Several list members installed my beams when I last had them 3 years
ago, so there's plenty of info in the archives. Most notable is an
excellent article by the venerable H. Steven Dolan, with detailed
installation info and photos of each step. 

The price is $399.95.  Again, they fit 1971 on.
