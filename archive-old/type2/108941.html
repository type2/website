Subject: Has anyone else had bad luck....

with a LUK clutch assembly??

I just went thru a nightmare with one on my 77 Westy. About 2 weeks ago my clutch cable snapped violently. It
broke inside the bowden tube and bent the end of the steel tube welded to the bus. I replaced the cable and
bowden tube and straightened the steel tube. But the clutch would not disengage.... Even with full travel of
the arm. So I dropped the engine and looked at the pressure plate, bearing, and operating shaft. All looked OK
so I compared the Sachs plate to a new LUK. The LUK plate was thicker and the fingers stood higher, so I
installed the new plate, disc, and throwout bearing. Still the clutch would not disengage!! So I dropped the
engine again and looked closer at the operating shaft. The big plastic bushing on the arm end had a lot of
slop on the outside and inside of it. Removed the shaft and there was a lot of wear on the metal section that
went thru the plastic bushing. So I ordered a new shaft from an on-line vendor because it was cheaper than the
dealer..... that became another nightmare....
Finally got the shaft [more ways than one] and new bushings and put it back together. The shaft has very
little slop in it now. Put the engine back in and still no clutch disengagement!
So I dropped the engine again and put my old Sachs clutch assembly in, with the Sachs style bearing. Put the
engine back in.
Now the clutch works!!!

The LUK plate has a smaller opening on the diaphragm fingers than the Sachs. I believe this is why the fingers
stick up higher..... The throwout bearings must be keep together with each brand of pressure plate. [I did not
mis-match them]

Did I just get a bad pressure plate? Or has anyone else had this happen?
