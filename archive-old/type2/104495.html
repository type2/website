Subject: 74 Parts Bus in Ohio

Hello All,

Response has been great.  Everyone wanted pix....so I grabbed the
disposable, snuck into the back yard, and click click click.

I imagine 1,000's trying to log onto the page at the same time, so be
patient and check back if you are denied access.

There is a link to the 74.

This of you who have already inquired, I have saved you notes, and will try
to get you what you want.

We are located in Ohio....beautiful sunny (today) Ohio.

Kind Regards,

Frank E Biffath III
