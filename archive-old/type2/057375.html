vintagepkX  wrote in  about intermittent 2 second interupptions in power on a
79 2.0L.  It sounds like just like two different problem I had with my Mom and
Dads 77 2.0L.  We found the problem very difficult to find, what with our not
knowing what we were doing and all. We had sort of
learned to live with the problem, my brothers and I affectionatly naming it
the &quot;Herky Jerk&quot;.

First thing to check (IMHO):  Make sure that the points are in good shape, in
adjustment and like that.  The last time I had this problem, I had gotten a
bit lazy about keeping the points adjusted, and eventully the rubbing block
had worn enough such that points were marginally opening.  After I adjusted
them, and set the timing, everthing was fine.

Next thing:  The first time we had the &quot;Herky Jerk&quot;, and we did not know this
until long after the problem started, was because the carbon strip that the
air flow meter wiper contacts, was worn.  CAREFULLY pry off the plastic cap
(or pull it off, or some other method that avoids breaking the plastic like I
did) and look at the carbon strip.  Does it look worn?  Like parts of it are
worn through?  That might explain why at some throttle positions i.e full
highway driving it works. If so you may need to replace the air flow meter. We
got by for a few months by dabbing tiny amounts of conductive paint that my
Dad got from work onto the worn spots of the carbon strip.  If you try this be
careful, as there is ample opportunity to make a mess and screw up the whole
thing.  This worked for us for a while, then eventually we replaced the air
flow meter.  It seems it would be fun to try replaceing just the carbon strip,
if one could figure out how to reproduce such a thing.

Other than that, check the wiring for loose connections, bad grounds and like
that.
