Subject: Re: [T2] Thieves hit my westy! Help replacing front window!

I agree.  I lost a passenger window, $50 stereo, and 1/4 of my dash to 
&quot;crack heads&quot; while in San Diego.  We have thieves here on Maui that 
make a good living ripp'n off visitors and locals - best weapon is 
unlocked door and nothing of value inside.   Nothing lost nothing broken.

&gt; ALWAYS! $25 stereo = $250 worth of damage. $10 stereo = no damage.
