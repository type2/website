Subject: Re: [T2] Home done frontend alignment

&gt; I was just told that Canadian Tire couldn't do the alignment on my 70 bug
&gt; because they didn't have the specs. I can't imagine an easier vehicle to do
&gt; one on, so thought, what the heck, I'll do it myself. I seem to recall you
&gt; could do one yourself with a tape measure. Has anyone done one lately and
&gt; remembers the procedure? I posted it to the type 2 list as well, because the
&gt; front ends are the same design.
  Thanks,
