Odd.  None of the ones i purchased has such a item..

&gt; Is there a way to check total advance w/out the spendy
&gt; little timing light??? I just have the standard strobe
&gt; light...no digital readout.

yeah!  Aim the light, grab the throttle and watch the advance as the rpm
increases.  it will top out at some point, even though rpm may increase.
what is going to move is the TDC notch, it will move away from the
idle-timing point X degrees.  uprights, the crankcase line will stay the
same, but the relative position to the pulley will change...you'll see
what i mean when you try it.


If you have a type4, its easier to really tell, but with a degree wheel or
your own marks on the pulley, its doable with an upright as well.
