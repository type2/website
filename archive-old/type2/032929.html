&gt;1.  Should I stay with the braided hoses (when I went to parts store, they

It would be preferable, but most &quot;emission hose&quot; that you will find in the
FLAPS will stand up just fine to the 20-25 inches of max vacuum that will
be contained by the hoses to your distributor.  After all, it's carrying
the same kind of vacuum as in all the American cars for which it is
designed.  There is nothing special or different about the vacuum in German
air-cooled engines.

&gt;2.  Is there a &quot;spec&quot; size for both hoses? What are the correct sizes for
&gt;the 2
&gt;hoses?

Don't know offhand.  You could check one of the service manuals (if you
don't have Bentley yet, I suggest you buy it - it's not expensive) or buy a
vernier caliper (an essential tool IMO) and measure the OD of the nipples
yourself, then buy hose with a slightly smaller ID.  The quick and dirty
method is to just go to your FLAPS and buy a few feet of each size from
1/8&quot; to 1/4&quot;.  It's cheap, and having extra hunks of hose under your seat
for emergencies can never hurt.

&gt;(Parts stores i went to do not have the exact same size as the hoses
&gt;presently
&gt;connected to my distributor)

&gt;4.  Is it critical that one stay with the spec sizes?

The hose should fit snugly.  If it is a loose fit, don't use it.  If it is
so tight that you can barely force it on, don't use it.

&gt;5.  Which hose goes where?  (as I cannot be certain that the present set-up is
&gt;correct)

The port on the outer half of the canister is vacuum advance, and goes to
the port in the middle of the left or right carb.  The port on the inner,
flat half of the canister is vacuum retard, and should be connected to the
port at the base of the left carb (inside, throttle-body level).

&gt;6.  Finally, why is one hose bigger than the other?

I don't know, but I'm sure it has something to do with &quot;DM&quot;.

&gt;I have checked the archives but these questions were not specifically
&gt;answered.

No offense, but I found the answer to #5 in less than one minute:

35: Here's a method I use that might work for you.  Close the big screw on the
36: top of the left carb (idle air adjust) completely (all the way in
37: clockwise) and adjust the throttle stop screws on each carb until a) idle
38: is very very low (like 600 rpm) and pulling each spark plug wire at the
39: distributor reduces the rpm equally.  Now open up the big adjustment screw.
40: The idle speed should come up.  Set it to about 1200 rpm and then adjust
41: the two volume control screws so it runs smooth.  Then back the idle down
42: to wherever you like it using the big adjustment screw.

44: &gt;Timing, dwell,
45: &gt;valve clearence, etc are all set correctly, and I've used a uni-sync
46: &gt;to balance the air flow for them.  Its that darned air leak at the
47: &gt;base (warped throttle body).

51: &gt;      I asked the list what the stock setup for the vacuum hoses for
52: &gt;on a dual carbed typeIV engine.  I recieved two replies:
53: &gt;
54: &gt;- Mike West said use a &quot;T&quot; to hook each of the outside ports to the
55: &gt;advance and plumb that to the advance port on the dizzy (the port on
56: &gt;the advance chamber that points away from the dizzy).  The inside port
57: &gt;on the left carb then goes to the retard on the dizzy.
58:
59: He's right.
60:
61: &gt;Mike said that each carb is pulling vacuum only half the time, hence
62: &gt;you need to plumb both sides.  This made sense to me, but I was
63: &gt;wondering where the air cleaner connections go.
64:
65: One goes to the preheater gizmo.  Not sure where the other one goes - maybe
66: to the charcoal canister?  Don't hold me to that.  But I'm sure it doesn't
67: go to the distributor.  Mike is also right about teeing the vacuum but in
68: practice it really doesn't matter if you don't join the carbs.  I run the
69: advance from the left carb with the right carb plugged, and it runs the
70: same.  I checked both methods with a vacuum gauge just to make sure.  Same
71: vacuum read whether supplied by one side or two.
72:
73: &gt;For the heck of it let me say that I drive this bus, with an air leak
74: &gt;on the left carb, uneven idling, and incorrect vacuum setup 45 miles
75: &gt;round trip to work, 5 times a week, plus all the other trips I have to
76: &gt;make in it (to the store, taking trash to the dump, etc...)  I'm not
77: &gt;that proud of my rough running bus, but it gets me there and back
78: &gt;while I figure out this dual carb setup.
79:
80: Be careful.  If your vacuum leak at the throttle plate is large, the bus
81: will never idle smoothly and you run the risk of having one half of the
82: engine run leaner than the other half.  That could easily lead to a burnt
83: valve.  I'd fix the vacuum leak pronto.  Doing anything else first is
84: simply wasting your time and endangering your motor, IMO.
