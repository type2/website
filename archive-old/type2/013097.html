Hi Adam,

I didn't know bus depot had a bracket like that.  Is
the Sanden compressor supposed to be more efficient
than the York?  Can you get Sandens at junk yards? 
How much for the bracket and compressor?

I've had the York in-dash AC on my 80 Westy working
off and on for a couple years.  It really cools the
front passengers, but seems to lower the gas mileage a
good bit.  The main problem is I can't seem to keep
the York bottom plate seal from developing slow leaks.
 What's your experience been with the York?

I'm looking for FR12 to try instead of R12.  Intercool
FR12 is supposed to be a direct replacement for R12. 
FR12 is supposed to work well and uses a blend of
environmentally friendly refrigerants.  However, it
seems to be available only in sun belt states.  Do you
know anyone using FR12 successfully?

Rob
