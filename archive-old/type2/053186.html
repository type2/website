Subject: 50-100 lbs. and Mileage

Would 50 to 100 pounds make a difference in gas mileage for city
traffic. I have been leaving all of the camping equipment in the bus
during the week while I drive to work. If it makes a big difference I
will stow it at home until the next camping trip.
Thanks
Meredith
