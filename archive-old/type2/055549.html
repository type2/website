Subject: DWELL on this

 The rule of thumb ( my thumb, anyway) as the dwell increases, your timing retards. I try to get 44-45 on the dwell, use good cam lube, set the timing to specs and I'm done there. Next time I see the vehicle, I check the dwell and if it has increased due to rubbing block wear, I know to reset the timing. I have used both plastic and phenolic Bosch points for  EEEK  18 years, ( damm, time flies) and I really can't say which one is better. There are a heck of a lot of distributors out there with cam lobes that are rough as hell, however. That would tend to blame one type over the other as far as longevity. Hope this helps.
