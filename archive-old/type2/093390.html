Subject: Re: [T2] Antenna with Springy Flexible mount

Somebody asked, and I missed parts, I guess.

&gt;&gt;Im looking for an Antenna with a Flexible spring mount so that people 
&gt;&gt;dont break it by pulling it .
&gt;&gt;anyone know where I can find one.????
=================================&gt;
What type of antenna are you mounting ?
Where do you plan on bus-locating it ?

If you already have a mount, I have several brand new antenna springs of 
different sizes and strengths.

I also have a few brand new mounts, and quick disconnects for easily 
stabbing and removing antennas from mounts.

I also have several mobile antennas of various types and dimensions.

What do you think you need?

I probably have it.
