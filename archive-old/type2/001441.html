Hi Volks,
    Does anyone have a picture of a late bay with the champagne edition
stripes posted on the net? Please point me in that direction if you would be
so kind.  Or if someone would measure the width and location from the belt
line would be adequate.  I remember these stopping on the front door and
wrapping all the way around the rear, can someone confirm this? tia

Darrell
