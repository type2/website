Subject: Re: LITLE BIT OF EXHAUST TROUBLE!!!!!

Pay close attention to what the exhaust gases are getting hot - I burned 
two places in the rear apron of my Beetle.

Another note, I was told that if cold air gets into the exhaust port 
because you lack the exhaust system, it could crack the head. Ask someone 
more educated that I.

Could also lean out your mixture thus ruining valves (no back pressure).

Tickets from grumpy cops? (Once lived next to a busy intersection and hated 
cars/trucks with no mufflers...)

&gt;Merry Christmas everyone, i was going to work today and notice that Janis my
&gt;beloved 75 camper was making an unuasual amount of noise.  I got to work and
&gt;didn't think much about it at first since it seemded to subside as i went
&gt;further, but at the end of the day i was driving out and stopped in the
&gt;parking lot becasue she was really screaming by now i thought maybe i had
&gt;areal problem but when i looked down at the exhaust pipe and mufler it was
&gt;gone.  I slowly made my way home and checked it out further while trying not
&gt;to get rained on.. It appears to have just fallen off because all the
&gt;mountingm hardware is still there just no muffler or pipe.  I do have an old
&gt;bug exhaust and my question is will it affect performance or damage my bus
&gt;if i put this on since it seems like ti will mount on just fine. i am only
&gt;16 and have limited experience with such things and would like any advice..
&gt;thanks for your time.
