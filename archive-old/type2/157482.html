Subject: Re: [T2] Breakdown - Resolution

I had this problem on one of my Jags.  The tank had a sizeable  drain easily accessible behind the rear fender.  Don't know if the  bus has a drain on the bottom, how easy it is to get to, etc.  But  what I did was completely drain the tank and flush it with a water hose  really good.  Then I filled it about half full of Kerosene and  stuck an air hose down in it to really slosh it up good.  Drained  the Kerosene and filled it with Gasoline.  Water is heavier than  Kerosene and it pushes it to the bottom.  It is lighter than  Gasoline.  So, pump some out through the fuel line into a glass  container until you don't see any more water floating to the top.   Since I didn't fill the tank with Kerosene I didn't completely solve  the problem.  But I go much longer between having to change fuel  filters.  Maybe once every couple of months as opposed to  days.  If you can afford it, fill it up with Kerosene.  I  saved mine last time and may buy enough more to fill it up and do it 
 again.  
  
 On the other hand, when my bus needed this a  few years ago, I paid my local VW guy to do pull it and have it boiled  out and treated.   $250 and no other problems.   Cheers...KR
