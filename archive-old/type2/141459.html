Subject: Re: [T2]tire broke inward this morning on me

Chai,

I just read one of your later posts:

_________________________________________________________________________

&gt;  well thing is that the ball joints are brand new(couple months old
maybe?) but i am holding no &gt;blame here.
 &gt;The company that did them is ******very professional**** and i would go
back to if it werent 5 hours+ away from them.
  i just gotta get it fixed.
  what it seems to me cause when they were put in i was there and watched
and knew what was happening and they showed me as the job was done what was
happening.

  *******the arms there selves are worn out,... they tacked the arms but the
tack on that side must of come loose?*******

_________________________________________________________________________

    This just burns me to no end. Another case of a &quot;Brand X&quot;, &quot;Half Ass&quot;
repair shop giving the industry and Technicians in general a bad name!
    This is why some states are making noises about Licensing Technicians.
Watch what happen to the labor rate when that happens. Not sure how I would
vote on this one. I don't want Big Brothers nose in my shop, but if this
kind of thing continues to happen, he will be there.
    There are some jobs you make money on by &quot;not&quot; doing them. This is one,
repaired in this way.
    You should never have to weld a ball joint in. Its a sure sign of
something being wrong. They knew that. So the fact they did it, in the way
they did, makes them very dangerous. Not to mention the fact that some ball
joints have plastic parts in them, and that much heat would ruin them. Of
course they also showed off their welding skills. Their weld broke and the
ball joint came out.
    You say you place no blame. Well you should. You trusted them to repair
your to car to drive safely, and paid your hard earned bucks. Did your
dollars not work at their bank?
    This is why I say the shop that done this is bordering on the criminal.
No concern for doing the job right. Not to mention the lives they
endangered. You were carrying your KIDS in the car when this happened right?
So what if you would have been on the Interstate running 75 MPH in a curve?
Your lucky there 5 hours away!!!! Don't go back and warn all your friends,
and enemies for that matter.
    I'm not saying our shop has never had a come back, or a part failure. I
can however say that we have never intentionally done a repair that to the
best of my knowledge was not a 100% right. We make mistakes, were human. But
I sleep very well at night.
    Enough Soap Box for today. Please all, remember to use a little common
sense when doing, or having your car worked on. Especially on safety related
systems, steering, brakes, fuel systems, lighting, etc. Don't try to
outsmart the engineers who designed it, fix it right the first time! Quality
repair work is not expensive, its priceless!
