Hmmm... what list is this again?

&gt;Our buses are efficient in that they can

I don't agree with that at all.  Old busses do make good campers, however.
The bad thing is that there is no way that you can justify their engines,
since even though they get better mileage they still put out a ton more
pollution than say a new Chevy van conversion, or a Rialta.  Someone else
said this before, but it bears repeating:  If (insert name here) really
cared about the environment, (insert same name here) wouldn't be driving a
non-catalyst bus.  I don't care how good of tune it is in or how
meticulously you maintain it, it will still pollute hundreds of times worse
than a new car.  That is a FACT.

&gt;	As for me, I'm thinking about a TDI conversion for my '65 EZ camper,
&gt;which would sip biodiesel and be lubed with hemp oil.
