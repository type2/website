Subject: Are these tires  a potential death trap?

------_=_NextPart_001_01C20CDD.289A9400

I have 71 Westy bought 3 months ago, with new tires on it, 2 people have
told me that they are an accident waiting to happen.

Details from the side of the tires:

185 70R/14 
Ultra Steal Belt A/S Supreme Sport
Max load range 1155 lbs _at_ 32 psi
2 ply steal , 2 ply polyester
Sidewalls 2 ply polyester

They drive fine, I've been on the interstate driving to Baton Rouge from
Houston,  over 2,000 miles on them so far. 

Any help would be appreciated, a buddy on mine has the Yoko 356's on his 70
Westy and loves them.

Should I yank them off?
