Subject: Cam Dial-In questions

If any of y'all who are running the Web Cam 107i would chime in here, I'd 
appreciate it. I'm in the process of dialing in my cam. I'm going to be using 
the stock 2.0L FI set-up, with the exception of slightly higher flow 
injectors, stock displacement, 1.8L valves and a comp. ratio of exactly 
8.0/1.0. The cam is ground to a lift of .430, duration of .255 and a duration 
of .225_at_.050. I'm using the straight cut adjustable gears, Web supplied hyd. 
lifters and stock rockers, ratio of 1.3/1.0. Right now, I've got my lobe 
centers set _at_ 109deg. That puts them right in the middle of the &quot;Moderate&quot; 
scale, and if my math is right, also gives me 4deg. of built in advance via 
the crankshaft. The question is thus: Where are you guys/gals setting your 
lobe centers at? Keeping them fairly wide, or leaning toward the low/mid 
range torque values and going tight with them. I don't want to crank in too 
tight a value and turn this engine into an RPG7, so I thought I'd get a List 
consensus.
Thanks,
Robb
