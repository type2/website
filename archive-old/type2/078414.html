Subject: Re: [T2] driving w/o windshield [was: replacing windsheld and rubber
 together?] 

Volks,

The good news is that driving without a windshield is almost *never*
illegal (1).  If it were, then motorcycles would all need fairings to use
the roads.  Not having eye protection is, for good reason, almost
universally illegal tho.  If you do drive w/o a windshield, wear
goggles/glasses, for legalities and safeties sake!
