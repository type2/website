&gt; I am tempted to do it to my 1976 camper as the sender is not working.  What

Are you kidding?  You're making a 5&quot;x5&quot; hole, just enough room to get the 
sender in and out.  Zero effect on &quot;structural integrity&quot;.

After you replace the sender, make a cover from sheet steel and secure it 
down with self-tapping screws.  The cabin would be protected from gas 
entering in the event of a tank rupture, a very rare occurance.

By the way, this kind of repair/modification is approved by VW in Germany.
