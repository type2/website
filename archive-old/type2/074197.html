Subject: Parts from a 73 to a 68

Was wondering if anyone knows if the following parts from a 73 Bus
will work on a 68 Bus.

Windshield? - I believe it does but would like confirmation.

Wiper Arms?

Front Bumper? - I know they are different styles but was wondering if
a 73 Bumper would mount up okay on a 68 Bus.

Thanks to any and all help.

Kevin
