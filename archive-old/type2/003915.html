Hi David,

The Danish company went out of business in 1999. I know that Alan Schofield
who runs Classic VW Resto in the UK bought Stuff from the bankrupt Veng
company.
So I guess that if you want the Danish bodywork the best place for it is to
ask Alan Schofield.

I don't know if David still has the bodywork you need and maybe he purchased
some brazilian parts to replace the (maybe sold-out) parts from Denmark.

I hope you will succeed in your quest for the missing cargofloor panels
soon.

Greetz from Holland,

&gt; &gt;I think wolfsburg west is the schoefield distributor now.


&gt; Ya, I called them but they don't have any. And I asked if they were from
&gt; Alan Schoefield an they said no. They got some other stuff from them, but
I
&gt; guess they used to get the floors from some company in Denmark, but the
&gt; company in Denmark never filled the last order they made over 2 years ago
.
&gt; I heard from Kelly that the ones that Alan Schoefield are Brazilian made.
&gt; Would you or anyone on the list know if a Brazilian made floor would fit
an
&gt; American bus??
&gt;
&gt; Thanks,
