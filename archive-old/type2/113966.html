I know Melling makes honest-to-goodness type IV pumps with the ears on them.  I would pay more for this rather than risk incompatabilities with the type I pump.  With a type IV pump, I don't see why the cam gear would make any difference, since the only part that interfaces with the pump is the slot in the side.  It's been a while since I looked at it though, so I can't claim absolute knowledge.

&gt;So I am not splitting this
&gt;engine to replace the oil pump.

You don't even need to drop the engine to remove the pump.  Why not do the pump swap before removing the engine, that way you won't have too much work invested if something goes wrong.
