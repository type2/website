Subject: Re: [T2] Help with a picture of the bit below the air cleaner

----- Original Message ----- 
From Charles Durrrant:
I am desperate to get a part  of my engine just right (1974 1800 carb engine).
 
 My van went into a garage and they fixed a flap that allows hot air
into the bit under the air cleaner by putting a screw to stop the flap
from closing. I'm not too familiar with this but I believe it should
be done by a vacuum to open the flap to control the air? Can anyone
help with a description and a photo of the bit with everything intact.
I don't like misplaced screws etc as there must have been a reason for
not having the flap always open.....

The only flap that I know of on a 73/74 dual carb engine is part of the air cleaner.  #5 here:

The hot air comes up the right front tin thru #43 and comes out #42 to meet the bottom of #5 above:
