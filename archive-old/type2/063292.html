&gt; 
&gt; Anyway, I'm going to be drilling a couple of holes in my van
&gt; in order to facilitate the intake/exhaust pipes for the Propex
&gt; heater I bought.  I need some advice, though, on how I should
&gt; prep/paint the holes so I can keep the rust demon at bay.
&gt; 
&gt; Any help is much appreciated.

It should be no major problem. Naturally, try to avoid scratching the 
original paint any more than necessary. Take a can of spray primer and a 
few Q-tips. Spray the primer into the cap (watch your eyes), until you 
get a puddle. Dip the Q-tip and apply to the bare metal. Wait until 
dry. Repeat w/ a paint similar to the orginal color. To get &quot;fancy&quot; you 
can apply heavy coat of wax after several hours (don't rub, just apply, 
let dry, remove the excess). The heater duct flanges should cover the 
&quot;ugly&quot;, and the paint will protect from rust.
