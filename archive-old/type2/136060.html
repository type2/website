&gt; Point being, sometimes it's best to just relax &amp; go w/the flow.  Mount
&gt; your spare, paint an emblem on (have somebody paint on an emblem,
&gt; probably cost less than replacing it a few times.)  You'll feel better.

Even better, cut an emblem from white reflective tape.  It'll pass the
30/30 test and will also provide an additional reflector for nighttime
safety.
