Perhaps something really foul like Deer Scent or cat piss could be injected
through a needle into the carb body while accelerating would deter the
tailgaters.

&gt; Hey, a$$holes, start out 10 minutes early and enjoy the ride!!!! Thats
&gt; what I do, in our little Jetta Diesel(53 bhp!) ! The other people who
&gt; consider the public roads their personal racecourses or place to get out
&gt; their frustrations about how much they hate their lives don't really
&gt; have too much to do with my life being the true rednecks they are.... Ne
&gt; illegitimus carborundum!Andy, I'm gonna have my Bus('77 T'porter) on the
&gt; road this autumn and expect to have more encounters of the fourth
&gt; kind(G!), but I will not be intimidated, either.
&gt;
&gt; Chris in South Carolina.
&gt;
&gt; PS: Andy, I was born and raised in Miami, just 4 blocks from Jackson
&gt; Memorial Hospital, 10th ave. and 14terr. Lived there for 16 years and
&gt; moved to Miami Springs when My ma sold our house. I haven't been back
&gt; since 1977 and what I saw then was enough to keep me  out for good. Good
&gt; Luck!

&gt; &gt; &gt; Sadly, I must reply that this approach is no longer very effective out
here in the Greater Seattle/Puget Sound area.  It might even get you shot...
&gt; &gt; &gt; Around here, driving in the curb lane of a city arterial at _ONLY_ 5
MPH over the posted limit will get you deluged with &quot;negative feedback&quot;.
&gt; &gt; &gt; Comments in casual conversation along the lines of &quot;...and the SOB
refused to drive more than [5, 10, any number will do] MPH over the limit,
and he/she made me late for...&quot; are common in gatherings at any level of
society, polite or otherwise.
&gt; &gt; &gt; It's my experience that VW buses may receive a slightly higher level
of tolerance in this regard from drivers of sedans, etc.  But drivers of
SUVs, especially those newly transitioned from mini-vans, seem to operate in
a constant state of irritation at other drivers/vehicles including VW buses.
