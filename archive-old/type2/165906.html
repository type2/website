&gt;There seems to be very little room to get the fan off the front of the engine

&gt;Is smacking it with a rubber mallet OK? 

There maybe some rust holding it but you don't really need to otherwise.

&gt;I already understand how to remove the three pointed holder on the shaft with 
&gt;I think 3 pieces of metel or what ever.
&gt;
&gt;So, how do I get the fan off.

You need to remove the tin pieces around the fan (the hold the exhaust shield if you still have that).

After that it will just pull off. There is a key on the back that is probably the cause of the tight fit.
