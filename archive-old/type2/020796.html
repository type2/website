Hi Folks

I can hear the rumblings in the woods here... I think they have smelled the
aroma of the EveryBus Beer all the way from Tn. 

It looks as if at least 6 Buses are staged to Leave CANADA thru Niagara Falls
Ontario and head South for a scenic weekend whirlwind tour to North Carolina!

The Proposed tour route, or is it root, :-) would start Thursday morning,
Buffalo Ny to Erie Pa then Pittsburg and the pike to Breezewood,, then head
south to Winchester Va. 

There is a stop over in this area for the night,, and then head south along the
east side of The Blue Ridge Mountain,, on I-29 to North Carolina, to arrive
Friday afternoon for Good Times!

Is there any Folks that are interested in Hooking up along the way? 

Let me know, and we can fit you into the plans...
