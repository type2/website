Subject: in a pickle

ok i am stuck between purchaseing another bus that may be in better shape or putting a turn key engine in 76 transporter i have now...

i have sevral offers since my post and the wife is saying why not put this money in the bus we got... also had one list member ask me the same thing..
so heres the question...
where can i get a turnkey engine locally and have it put it my bus within the next couple of weeks..
i am not impatient but am struggleing so bad to make it to High Country festival this year...
if it doesnt happen fine but i am going to make it either in this bus or another i am hopeing..?
I dont know about the tranny in Grace though it is a 79 tranny and if i buy a turn key i am deffinetly not going to be able to afford a rebuilt turnkey 2.0 ....
will a 1800 work with my tranny?
maybe i can afford a 1800 turnkey engine..
maybe?

I dont want to buy it though and it not hook up to the tranny....
maybe i am just getting ahead of myself tottally thinking of High country...
if i dont make it thats fine but even bigger problem is that my daughter starts school aug 14th and i have to have a daily driver by then so that i can pick her up from school....
arrrrrgggggggggg!
can someone shed some much needed relief this way...
pickled...............***********

i do not i repeat do not want to buy anything non Vw... 
i can go buy a chevy truck or whatever but then again i dont want a chevy truck i want A vW AND PREFERABLLY  either my bus or another in better running condition...

would even consider a nice bug but once again the turn key engine for my bus woudl be the better deal././/
the engine is the main thing wrong with my bus,...
the PO didnt care about the bus and she was very neglected and as far as the engine well that has been the main problem all along even though there has been other minor problems....
i am not much on going fast either just want to make it there and back not to much to ask...

if anyone can point me in the right direction i will check into it...
i know someone that rebuilds engines but on the side he does this..
might be difficult for him to do and havent been able to contact him since last week..//?
 once again time is running out for me to be able to drive her..
if that person could put it in for me and it isnt to far i might be able to get it towed to them to instal the turnkey engine for me...
long day and alot on my mind...
thanks for all the help anyone can give..
peace
