Subject: RE: [T2] bus depot charcoal canister

&gt; &gt; I recently ordered a new charcoal canister for my 74 from Bus Depot.
&gt; &gt; The one I got is cylindrical, whereas the original canister 
&gt; &gt; (on every  bus that I've seen, including mine) is ovoid.


&gt; The 78 and later style is all that's available.



As far as I know the one we sell is the only one available (or at least
the only one that is listed by VW).  We get it right from Volkswagen,
who sells it as a suitable replacement for the earlier style.
