mholser_at_adobe_dot_com (Malcolm Holser) asks:
&gt;So you worldwide net community, here's the question: Does your horn
&gt;work, and what is it for?

My horn worked when I bought my bus last February.  I used it for
honking goodbye when I pulled out of my driveway.  Last week it quit
working.  BTW, I live in NJ, but I consider myself atypical of the
general societal degradation that defines NJ.
