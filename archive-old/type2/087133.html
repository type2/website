Subject: Re: [T2] charcoal canister revisited

Christopher,

On my 78, the air cleaner connection goes to the top of the cannister and 
the one on the bottom of the cannister goes in a metal port on the fan 
shroud.  

This port is on the passenger side toward the rear of the car.

Cheers, dave

&gt; Thanks all for the feedback, I think I know what is happening now.
&gt; Essentially, my recovered vapors are currently dumping into the engine
&gt; compartment
&gt; via that smallest hose coming out of the charcoal canister, or something to
&gt; that effect.
&gt; I am going to borrow back my bently tonight and see if I can't figure out
&gt; what connectors
&gt; I will need to get this system back in place. You know, ive had this bus
&gt; worked on by this
&gt; and that person over the past year, some of them VERY good at what they do,
&gt; and nobody ever
&gt; pointed this out to me, or said something was wrong. Its either something
&gt; that just started recently (I dont think so) or not that important of a
&gt; system to some people...
&gt; 
&gt; either way, if they built it with it in place, they obviousley thought it
&gt; was worth the extra money to do so, so ill follow suit.
&gt; 
&gt; thanks again,
&gt; 
&gt; Christopher

&gt; &gt; &gt; Ok, on this topic, what are those tubes/pipes/whatever that go up into
&gt; the
&gt; &gt; &gt; air intakes up on the side of the bus, and seem to connect just above
&gt; the
&gt; &gt; &gt; motor in the firewall stuff? Mine are connected to nothing at all, and
&gt; &gt; &gt; appear to be missing whatever connects them to each other, or whatever
&gt; else
&gt; &gt; &gt; they go to....
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; I looked around and the only disconnected hose I found came off of the
&gt; top
&gt; &gt; &gt; of the charcoal filter, perhaps this is where those two tubes should be
&gt; &gt; &gt; connected to?
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Any suggestions appreciatted.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Christopher,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Err... Umm.... ahh.... err.... I don't know?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I am sorry, but I don't see the picture.  Are you talking in the air
&gt; &gt; intake towers at the rear corners of the bus?  These tubes... about 1/4&quot;
&gt; &gt; in diameter?  do they seem to just go up. U-turn and come back down?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; If this is them, then they are indeed part of the vapor recovery system,
&gt; &gt; along with the charcoal canister.  the tubes start in front of the
&gt; &gt; firewall on top of the  gas tank, come back to thoes loops that are
&gt; &gt; anti-siphon devices, then to the charcoal canister.  The charcoal canister
&gt; &gt; has a linked system that blows air thru it and into the intake where it
&gt; &gt; goes into the cylinders and the gas vapors are burned.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; If this is *not* what you are talking about, please post again!
