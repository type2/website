Subject: Heater boxes and vacuum hose...

Hi all,

I'm in the final stages of reassembling Frances for a cross country trip and
have gotten to the heater boxes.  I decided to disassemble them and send the
insides off to be HiPerCoated with the rest of my exhaust.  Now I'm
wondering what to use to replace the asbestos/aluminum pads that surrounded
the heater fins.  Any suggestions?  What was it's original purpose?  Was it
to keep the plenum away from the fins?  Insulate the plenum?  Seal the
plenum to the fins and force all air across the fins?

On another note:  I'm skeptical as to the PO's judgement when replacing fuel
hose and vacuum stuff, so I need to know what sizes of fuel hose and vacuum
hose are used on a '76 Westy (FI) so I can replace it all.  Anybody have a
list of the sizes and how much of each size I need to do this right?  Or
optionally, how do you figure out what size lines you need from measuring
the fittings?  Say on the FI fuel ring, the steel tubing is 8mm OD - does
that mean I need 8mm fuel line or should it be 7mm?  Is there an advantage
to using the 'FI' hose clamps vs. the standard hose clamps?

Thanks,
Niall
