&gt; It has a 2.0L engine and I am finding it a bitch to get started in the
morning. I have to 
&gt;pump the gas like a bastard to get it going. Is this typical? 

If it's stock, you have fuel injection, right?  That should start right up
even on the coldest of mornings. 
actually with AFI you shouldn't have to touch the gas at all to start it.
 something is wrong.   

&gt;wouldn't mind a break from the shifting but I don't want to screw up a
perfectly good standard and 
&gt;replace it with an automatic and be even less satisfied with that.

keep it standard.  It is a PITA to change, and auto trans problems are an
even worse PITA
