Subject: engine removal problem and question

Help!  I can't get the brace out.......
Here are some stats first:  It's a '69 campmobile with a stock 1600.
Here is the problem........The brace that attaches to the
rear of the motor (FIF) and to the rubber motor mounts will not
come out.  I supported engine, removed the three bolts in the
center, removed the two nuts from the rubber mounts and the
brace will not come out.  It is free to move around a little until
I begin to slide it up and off the studs on the mounts.  Before
it is all the way up and free it binds between the body frame
on either side.  It would appear that the bus has been hit slightly
from BOTH sides at the rear and the body may have been
seriously injured.  The brace appears to be slightly bent on
the drivers side.  Any ideas besides beating the crap out of
it or cutting it??

Ps.  I did attempt to pry it up using a bottle jack but all it did
was get wedged and lifted the bus up.  Here is a before picture
if it helps.
