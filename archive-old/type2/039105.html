Subject: Re-spray Recommendations in England ?

My '79 van is in need of a re-spray and probably a few body panels need 
replacing too (round the rear lights and possibly the door skins or 
complete doors).

Does anyone have good experiences with any garages who specialise in doing 
this and what sort of price would it be.

If anyone has any contact details that would be great - I live in London 
but would be willing to travel a couple of hundred miles if I knew it was 
going to be a good job at a good price.

Cheers


Woodg
