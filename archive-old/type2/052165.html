Subject: Re: [T2] I killed my 68 DC engine

&gt;use some 88 cut in P&amp;C's since they are ideal for a bus since they have
&gt;extremely thick piston tops. I'm seriously considering doing this with a
&gt;74mm stroker crank ( another Ronnie idea) but funds may play a factor.
&gt;
Why not go to a 78mm stroke crank?  You can still use the stock rod length,
which helps keep the engine width down, and the cost is about the same.  I
agree with the machine-in 88 P&amp;C's, not only are the pistons forged, but the
wall thickness of the jugs is massive.  If you are going to stroke the
motor, there will be more side forces on the cylinders, which can lead to
blow-by, increased engine heat, etc.  The cut-in 88's can help prevent this.
I am running a 78mm stroke by 88 bore in my '71 Westy, and it goes over the
summit on highway 17 between San Jose and Santa Cruz (I assume you are also
in Santa Cruz, Calif.) in 4th gear, 50 mph all the way. The engine has
Kadron's and a W100 cam.  Run it by your mechanic and see what he thinks.
