I've searched the archives but have not found an answer to the following
question:

Can an '83 vanagon tranny be used in a late '70's loaf simply by swapping
the nose assembly on the tranny? The '83 tranny in question has the shifter
input on the *side* of the nose assembly of the tranny.

A couple of posts in the archive state 'stay away from the side shifting
vanagon trannies' (with regard to using in a loaf) - but can it be done by
swapping nose assemblies? (and perhaps bell housings?). The body of the
tranny sure looks the same as on my '77.

I'll bet one of the tranny re-builders on the list would know this right off
the top of their heads!

Thanks for any info.
