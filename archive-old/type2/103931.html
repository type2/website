Subject: RE: [T2] Type 2 = Truck??

&gt;A DMV that isnt busy?? Is there such a thing??
&gt;Ive never gone into the DMV here in Las Vegas and waited less than 2 hours.

&gt;&gt;Get out of town, where there's less %_at_#&amp;!!! people.  Would you drive a
half
&gt;&gt;hour to save two hours standing in line?  I do.

I can drive half an hour and still be in Las Vegas. Its not that easy around
here.
There are several DMV branches within a 30-45 minute drive. But the wait is
the same.
So, if Im going to wait 2 hours at any location, I may as well go to the
closest one.

Eric
