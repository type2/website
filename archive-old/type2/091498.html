Subject: '78 Westy exhaust pipes??

Hello everyone,

        I have a '78 camper that has what looks like dual exhaust
pipes.The pipes are located 1 on either side of the motor and are mounted
to the frame. They are about 2 feet long and attach to a piece of cooling
tin on the motor via a fresh air/heater hose. The pipes are 2 inch
outside diameter and I can not find a hose to fit. Beetle hose are almost
2 inches but not quite. Anyone know what these are for and where can I
find a 2 inch hose? TIA

        Ralph
        78 westy
