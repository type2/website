Subject: Re: [T2] Sealing a Hightop(converted)

Go to an auto body supplier and get some tar rope. Used to seal body 
seams. I have a package of tar rope about 1/8&quot; in diameter each, about 
6 inches long. Wrap it around the screw head and then tighten. I used 
it on my Westy 6 yrs ago and it continues to seal fine. 6 yrs out in 
the weather!

Silicone seems to fail for me everytime. It loses it's grip on the 
metal or glass at some point and then turns yellow and becomes a leaky 
mess. The tar will stay and do it's job for a long, long time.

You won't ever see silicone on a car applied at the factory... &lt;griN!&gt;

Silicone is popular I think b/c it is an easy material to use, and 
found everywhere in any town. I MUCH prefer 3M seam sealants b/c they 
have lasted for me. Any auto body supplier (yellow pages) will have it 
or something like it. NAPA may also have something like it (a better 
FLAPS i.e. not Advance Auto, Auto Zone) Our small town has 3 body shop 
suppliers so your town prob has some too.

See ya!
