Subject: Re: [T2] Vacuum dizzy with Progressive Weber?

Ed,

Slap a vacuum gauge on that port.  Note the inches/mm of vacuum at idle,
then run the engine up to ~2000  RPM and hold it for 5 seconds.

If the vacuum at idle is ~15 inches and it drops when you accelerate the
engine, then rises as RPMs stabilize, you are seeing &quot;manifold vacuum&quot;.
The port in the throat of the carb for this is below the throttle
butterfly (plate).

If it is near 0 inches at idle and rises with RPM then you are seeing
&quot;ported vacuum&quot;.  The port in the throat of the carb for this is barely
above the throttle butterfly.

The advance side of your distributor (the side away from the body of the
dist) gets ported vacuum.

*IF* you have it, the retard side of the dist (the tube facing the body of
the dist) gets manifold vacuum.

For info on where to time it, go to:

and search for your distributor.
