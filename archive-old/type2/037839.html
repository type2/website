Subject: wheel well

Hi All,

I'm starting to go through the back of the bus, removing rust and
repainting. The P.O. mounted the spare in front, so now I have an empty
wheel well that I'd like to clean up.  I'd like to remove, what appears to
be, 2 horse hair pads. Is there something I can soak these things with to
make removal a little user friendly?
Anybody ever toss the plastic covers and do their own ~cloth~ upholstery for
the bench and bed? I'm feeling bold...

Would somebody ping me the FAQ URL, please?

Pete
