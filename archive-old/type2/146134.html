Subject: Re: [T2] valves

Beware the aluminum pulleys with degree wheels on them. Are light and provide no dampening effects for crank vibrations. Maybe a big deal based on what I have read from a few sources. I know in other air cooled engines it is critical enough to prevent a broken crank. Dunno if that is an issue in the short VW 4 banger. Might just effect longevity of the crank bearings??? 

I took the time to paint marks on my pulleys. Find TDC #1 (verify it). Then find #2 and mark it, then #3, #4, etc. 

An earlier list poster explained a good method and so did Muir in the Idiot book.
