&gt;Ok, you plug it in at the campground. Well, I for one don't want to be within 100 yards 
&gt;of you listening to it all friggin' night. I personally prefer hearing the night stillness 
&gt;pierced by a hooting owl or love-struck mockingbird. It is also nice to hear things approaching.

Mike, where do you camp?  Most of the parks I've been to allow the giant RVs (TVs, gens, ACs, etc.) to park right alongside the tenters.  Even without them there 
are the people who think everyone within 100 yards wants to listen to their portable radio.  I find *that* plenty offensive to the point that one more freon-addicted 
bozo's AC unit isn't a huge distraction.

I agree noise pollution in campgrounds is a pain in the butt, of course -- and there are way too many people there who seem to think camping means your hotel room 
is in the woods.  I've camped in FL in the summer many times and it's not easy to keep cool, but possible - shower late and bring a fan.  People survived like that in 
FL for hundreds of years, and some still do.  People whine about the heat the way Robert Downey Jr. whines about staying clean &amp; sober.

&gt;Air conditioning a little VW bus is about the silliest excess-baggage idea I've seen cross 
&gt;this list since I subscribed. There. I said it and I'm glad.

OTOH, there are many evenings where I'd be ready to sell my soul for a dry bed (see http://www.supernet_dot_net/~jclark/fiction/freonjon.html for an elaboration on 
this).  I have a small window unit all rigged to take with me if, e.g., I lose my head completely and decide I've just got to camp at Jonathan Dickenson in August.

BTW, I've decided on a custom ice-rack cooling system for the 71 on long trips: a small mesh basket mounted just in front of the air vent intake.  Fill the rack with 
bag ice at every stop.
