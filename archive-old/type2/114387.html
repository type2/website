Subject: RE: [T2] Driving a bus

With those instructions, driving a bus reminds me of a certain scene out
of Monty Python http://www.cc.gatech_dot_edu/~pparker/grenade.html

 PS- To paraphrase (loosely) St. Muir:  Neither lug nor overrev, and
long
will be the days of you and your Bus in the Kingdom of Motoring.  Or the
Buddha:  The paths of revving and lugging are delusion.  The Middle Way
of
proper revolutions in their time will lead to enlightenment.  Or even
Crowley:  Do what thou wilt, but harm no motor with excessive nor
inadequate
revs.
  Yaay, it's Friday!  Oh, wait, my clock's 50 minutes fast...
