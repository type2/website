Subject: Re: [T2] ACVW in Milwaukee, WI?

It's not a VW event, but there will be plenty of good music at Summerfest 
this year, so be sure to check it out.  Take a drive through the east-side 
of town (where I live) and you'll see plenty of vintage VW's too.

Have a good trip &amp; enjoy the city

Chris
