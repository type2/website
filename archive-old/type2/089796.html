Subject: smoking motor???

Hey Everyone,
Just made the trip from burlington VT to Hartford Ct in my 80 westy and 
everything was great.  Stopped a few times to cool down gas up and check oil 
and used about a quarter of a quart.  Then when I stopped at the light at the 
end of the exit ramp I noticed smoke.  Pulled over about 250 feet up let it 
cool and checked oil.  Oil level still okay not really dirty changed it about 
350 miles ago.  So I drove it about 3 miles to my folks house and now have it 
parked.  I notice it also has a ticking sound  (new lifters in may)  it seems 
to have plenty of power and does not seem to let out big clouds of smoke when 
you goose it but at idle its faily smokey and is comeing out of the tail 
pipe. I think this from only looking out the rear view mirror.H  Anyone know 
what I should check or do?  Should it no longer be driven? Or anyone know of 
any good aircooled mechanics in this area?  Is it time to call boston bob?  
Thanks
Kevin
