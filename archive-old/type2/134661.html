Subject: RE: [T2] Shipping to Hawaii

&gt; I have a hitch that fits a Vw bus that I would like to ship
&gt; to Hawaii....
&gt; Does anyone have a suggestion to get it there without paying
&gt; an arm and a leg?


U.S. Mail is much cheaper than UPS, Fedex, etc. to Hawaii, if it fits within
the size/weight limits.
