Subject: Front wheel noise

Hello gentle VW hackers...

I'm having some trouble with noise coming from the front wheels of
my '76 Westy.

The noise started out as a constant &quot;chirp .. chirp .. chrip&quot; that got
faster as the Bus got faster.  The sound is unaffected by braking.  I
didn't think it was a wheel bearing, since there was no growling sound,
and the noise did not seem to change when turning left or right.

I figured I had a stuck caliper, or something.  So, while the Bus was
at the mechanic getting some exhaust work done (sigh, I'll be happy when
'76 models are exempt from smog tests in CA), I asked them to take a look
at it.  I described the symptom, and they seemed to understand, so &quot;great!&quot;.

Anyway, I am now suspecting they misunderstood me.  When I inquired as to
the details of the &quot;desqueak front brakes&quot; item on the invoice, the
verbal description of the actual work done made it sound like they were
attempting to fix a &quot;brakes squeak when applied&quot;, i.e. worn/glazed pads
or whatever.

In any case, their work did indeed make the noise go away... for a while
anyway.  I drove through Berkeley to get onto the freeway to head back
to San Francisco, window down, listening for the noise.  No noise.  Cool.
I get onto the freeway, and drive for about 1/4 mile in slow rush-hour
traffic before a 17 year-old kid changes lanes into my Bus (sigh, at least
the damage is only minor).  As I take the next exit and pull into a parking
lot to get the guy's insurance info, what do I hear -- a quiet &quot;semi-constant&quot;
squeak/scrape sound coming from the front wheels.

The exchange is done, and I get back onto the freeway.  When I get to the
Bay Bridge, I roll down the window to pay my toll, and listen for the noise.
It's getting a little louder.  By the time I take the 9th St. exit, the
noise is about as loud as it was before I took the Bus into the shop, but
still has the squeak/scrape character.

Ready to just be done with the Bus for the day (between an expensive shop
visit for exhaust work, a new ding and scratch in an otherwise mostly-
straight body, and the reappearing wheel noise), I park it and immediately
drown the day's sorrows in a few Red Tails.

So, this evening I put the front up on jack stands, and spin the right-front
wheel by hand.  The noise is easy to hear.  So, I pull the wheel to take a
look at the rotor.  Rotor looks pretty good -- no deep grooves, no glazing,
didn't feel warped, but had a slight coating of brake dust.  However, the
outer pad looked as if it was resting against the rotor, even though the
brakes were not being applied.  I had my wife press the pedal with her hand,
and the pad did not appear to move, although I was unable to turn the rotor
by hand when she pressed the pedal.

At this point, I'm feeling kind of annoyed at the mechanic, and am running
through the phone conversation I will have with him in my head as I put the
wheel back on.

However, after tightening the lugnuts with the Bus back on the ground, I
gave the top of the right-front wheel a little nudge, as if to rock the
Bus a bit.  The noise that this produced I can only describe as &quot;ka-Thonk&quot;.
It almost sounds like the sound the broad side of your finger nail colliding
with the hubcap makes, but lower pitched, as if the hubcap were about 3 or 4
times the diameter.

Intrigued, I go over to the other side, and give the left-front wheel the
same nudge.  No noise.  The left-front wheel does produce a similar scraping
sound when simply spun around, however.

Now, since I didn't give the wheel this nudge before I pulled it, I don't
know if it happened before I pulled the wheel.  I can't imagine that I
made it happen during the course of inspecting the rotor, so now I'm kind
of wondering if the noise I'm hearing IS actually the bearing.  But, since
the other wheel doesn't make the &quot;ka-Thonk&quot;, but does make the other noise,
I'm also convinced that there is still a problem with the brakes.

So, my question for you folks is two-fold:

	* Does it sound like my calipers are shot?  Disc brakes
	  are supposed to self-adjust, so I'm thinking that the
	  fact that the pad is seemingly resting against the rotor
	  indicates that the internal mechanism is not pulling it
	  back properly.

	* Could I be hearing symptoms of two problems?  Bad calipers
	  AND bad bearings?

I'm hoping I can get this problem solved with a quick (and inexpensive)
parts run and one or two evenings of work; my wife and I would like to
take the Bus camping overnight at a farm up in Winters (a bit past Davis
on I-80) within the next couple of weeks so my wife (who is a photographer)
can take some early-morning shots of workers harvesting heirloom tomatos.
But the last thing I want to do is drive the Bus that distance and warp a
rotor or overheat the hydraulics.
