Subject: RE: [T2] VW's take on tires - Owner's manual and Bently specify
   these  tires.

Great quote George.

I think this is why some of us like to play ball with these vehicles.
If you have a background/interest in the sciences/engineering fields,
then the engineering levels achieved by VW in an entry level vehicle
are inherently appealing to anyone interested in maintaining a good
cost-per-mile average.

I trust in, and enjoy duplicating the specifications long ago 
determined by those who knew best.

Why people on these lists attempt to constantly re-engineer the 
vehicles with toolboxes full of rationalizations is a mystery.

German engineers don't tend to overspecify things like American engineers,
as they expect the vehicle's users to adhere to their recommendations.
