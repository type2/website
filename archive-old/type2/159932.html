Subject: Re: [T2] Camper Window Help

when i installed mine in my camper I generously applied talcum powder all around the seal and just pushed them in real hard.  it was not easy, but if the seals are seated correctly on the jalousie frame and are adequately coated with talcum powder, the windows will go in with some efffort, then the screws can be installed.  gt
