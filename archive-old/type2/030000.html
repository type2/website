&gt; I don't like the looks of the Yokos.  They are generously rated at

Heh.


I put a set of Bridgestone RD-601's on the 66...they are very similar to
the Yoko 356. really a highway tread tire.  (these are the 195/75R14 D..)

I went from the Yoko 370 195/75...I LIKED that tire. It had
tooth.....anyway (if i go missing some 5's here, the 5 key is going
out..)

&gt; would be replacing.  I have never run this narrow of a tire and I worry 
&gt; about things like stability and traction when compared to wider tires.  My 

I cant say anything bad about the 603, as far as normal-use goes. Smooth,
quiet (the 370 was noisy..), handles fine.   I've never had any stabiity
issues running on 195's...some of you know my driving habits;)


&gt; bus is heavier than most, and with a full length permanent highroof needs 

though I've never driven a highroof...but I dont think i'd worry to much
just on that account.


&gt; and I'm afraid they would be terrible in the sand and dirt.

YES!  the 603 is fine (very surprisingly) in water..even decently deep
standing water at speed.  Dry traction is great, as well.

BUT get these puppies on the pebbles, and you might as well get out and
walk.  Gravel, sand, mud, wet grass, loose dirt...they SUCK.  I'd had to
adjust my road-choice preferences...

(the 370 was great offroad...to bad.)


&gt; pike's peak with the yokes and I pass Jeeps on the way up&quot;.  I need 
&gt; reassurance here cause I'm leaning towards the Trailhandlers - they give me 
&gt; a warm fuzzy.


being familar with the BFG tire in question, I'd agree.  I'd run them if
they wouldnt throw my speedo off.;)  (and i think they wont fit under the
rear wheelwell on the split..i think.)

DONT get the 356 if you like off-pavement travel more them on-pavement
travel. I carry my comealong these days..


If the Trailhandler has adequate load specs (is a C enough for that
highroof? but I know that finding a AT tire in D is near impossible now
that the 370 is gone....) I'd go for it.


good luck...see you there!:)
