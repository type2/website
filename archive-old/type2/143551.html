&gt; On the other hand, the Click/Clack stumper one Saturday was howto start a
&gt; &gt; vw(carbed bug) with a low battery that is parked in a valley where you
&gt; &gt; can't push it.
&gt; 
&gt; Umm, get battery charger, connect positive to big terminal on the
&gt; generator, negative to any handy body ground, wait for battery to
&gt; charge...
