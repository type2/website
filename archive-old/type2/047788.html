Subject: [T2] 82 westy emissions update

Hi all,

    Well I tried to get through DEQ today &amp; passed the first try.  After I
wrote you all, I checked my FI system &amp; could find nothing wrong.  I just
decided to try &amp; go through &amp; then I would have the official certificate of
failure.  All I did was drive it a bit &amp; let it idle while I was in line &amp;
it passed well.  There was one thing.  When I had the CO checked it was at
3%.  On the DEQ test they have the CO like this:

CO g/mi Max
149.0

Mine was 80.9.

    I never saw that before.  Anyway thanks to all of you for the various
suggestions.
