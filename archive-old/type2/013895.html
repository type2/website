&gt; &gt; Wicked general question, but what causes these?
&gt;
&gt; Start by looking for exhaust leaks.

After you do that, check for vacuum leaks.  Jim is right, exhaust leaks
are the more common problem here, but because you also mention a high
idle, I suspect that a vacuum leak may be involved.  The &quot;air management
system&quot; must be leak-free from air filter to muffler for everything to
work correctly.
