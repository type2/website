I had mine done at Al &amp; Ed's Stereo (SoCal chain). They did a fine job,
but they wired the power to be off when the ignition is off, so I had to
go back and have them wire it &quot;right&quot; (always on).

&gt; Hey Joel,
&gt; 
&gt; I would take it to a professional installation shop.  Something like Circuit
&gt; City or Sound Advice.
&gt; 
&gt; I recently had a stereo/tape deck installed in the dash with several
&gt; speakers and a cd changer under the sofa.  They did a great job.  Very
&gt; professional.  Everything looks like it belongs there, sounds great, and is
&gt; guaranteed.
