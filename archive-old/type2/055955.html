John,

the thickness of the dash padding between radio and ashtray also
precludes the use of the usual type of bracket. I obtained a snug fit
just by winding two layers of electrical tape around the gauge body. 

Sami ('75 Westy)

&gt; I installed a VDO oil pressure gauge in the dash (between radio and
&gt; ashtray) of my '77 Westy today and came up against an interesting
&gt; &quot;gotcha.&quot; This gauge has the new &quot;Spin-Lok&quot; mounting clamp system. 
&gt; That means the body of the gauge is plastic with threads molded into
&gt; it. A plastic ring (mounting clamp, according to VDO) threads onto
&gt; the body.  Unfortunately, there is not enough room behind the dash
&gt; to accomodate the ring. The dash curves inward at the bottom of the
&gt; gauge hole, so I couldn't even start the threads.
