Subject: RE: [T2] Horn sounds when High/Low Beam Flicked.

I had this prob in my 74... there was a bad wire in the there..If you take
the turn signal/wiper thing I don't know what its called but its right under
the steering wheel, held in by 2 screws .. now there is some wire touching
the column, if you need to get it to pass inspection , what I did is rap the
column in electrical tape ,and it was fine for inspection, and fixed it a
few days later when I had more time to search the bad wire out
hope it helps

Good afternoon,

My horn occasionally sounds when I flick the high/low beam switch.  Has
anyone else experienced this problem?  If so, how did you fix it?

Regards,
