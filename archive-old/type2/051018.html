&gt; Now, i have a t1 bus as i hate t4's (personal opinion only, nothign wrong

I suspect the load part is accurate

&gt; indicated 70 or so, doesnt put much load on the engine.  Now if i try to
&gt; do that uphill, i'll kill it. So, go forth and remeber, if your engine is
&gt; turning fast its blowing air fast, if its turning slow its blowing air
&gt; slow.  You need to figure out where you get the most air, and the least
&gt; heat... I find this to be around 70 in my 71 and around 65 mph in my
&gt; 61. Downshift when you have to put the pedal to the floor and the bus
&gt; still doesnt go faster.

and in my 78 with auto tranny the temp gauge says it runs coolest at about
55MPH, and while it is not overheated at 65-70MPH if my temp starts to go
up on a Very hot day I will back off to 55 for a while...the bus may go
faster than 65-70, in fact when cruising there is more pedal left, BUT I
won't go faster than that, besides I want to avoid the scenery and not be
visited by the local law enforcement folks

 
&gt; If you drive your bus at 55, i think it will be worse off, anything below
&gt; 3000 rpm for cruising is lugging the motor, and will hurt it if placed

one of the nicer features of the auto tranny is that it is next to
impossible to lug or overrev, it will just shift into the right gear as
needed.
