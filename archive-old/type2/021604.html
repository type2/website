I stopped at a local FLAPS and picked up a buncha the small vacuum line
and T fittings and it worked great.  Cheap too..

shouldn't be that hard to find the small hoses.  Just ask for the
diameter vacuum line you need and they should have the hose and
assortments of t-fittings to go along with them.

As far as the fat hoses, those will probably be a little more difficult
to find, esp with the correct bends...

good luck

&gt; Hi guys,
&gt; A few month ago I bought a 75 bus.  I started driving it daily for two
&gt; weeks when I pull my bug engine to rebuild it. Since then my drive to
&gt; work or back to home is uncertain.  One day I had a bad raw gas smell
&gt; while driving. The fuel hose from pump to fuel riel was pouring fuel. I
&gt; stop the bus right away, and fixed it with a spare; after that was fixed
&gt; the little hoses from the injectors start to leak too, fixed them, and
&gt; the hose that connects left riel w right riel started to dripping gas,
&gt; and so and so but I had no more spare fuel hoses so end up to my flaps I
&gt; bought 2 yards of german fuel hose and replaced every gas hose in the
&gt; engine compartment.
&gt; Now I having problems again, this time with vacuum hoses and rubber
&gt; fittings. Are all of them deteriorated and affecting engine performance.
&gt; I search the bus boys catalog, rocky mountain, Larry off roads and a few
&gt; others and I don't see all the hoses and rubbers I need. I know many of
&gt; the hoses are standard but many others has a special shape and
&gt; thickness, besides there are grommets rubber vacuum connectors etc I
&gt; need to replace and I don't know where to buy them or how to describe
&gt; them to the parts guy.
&gt; Are those hoses and fittings available for a 1800 cc Fi engine?
&gt; 
&gt; If some of you can lend me a hand on this matter I will certainly
&gt; appreciate it.
&gt; Thanks,
&gt; 
&gt; Edgard
