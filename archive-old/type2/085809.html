Subject: Re: [T2] Tuning AFM with Oxygen sensor

Hi Mark,
Good to hear from you again.

1. Have you established the correlation between voltage and fuel-air? 2. Do 
you have a High Impedance meter?
3. Can you really adjust the &quot;spring&quot; in the air sensor under cruise (I 
assume the bus would be under load and moving) conditions. I drove around 
with the air sensor lid off once and the pot wiper was very very busy as was 
the spring.

&gt;Hi Guys,
&gt;
&gt;The exhaust on my '78 is finally air-tight enough to use an Oxygen sensor 
&gt;for tuning the mixture. My goal is not to wire up a a gauge to the sensor. 
&gt;I'm more interested in setting the mixture with my voltmeter to improve the 
&gt;gas mileage then removing it and plugging the hole.
&gt;
&gt;I have the sensor in and I have played with adjusting the spring. I have a 
&gt;few questions:
&gt;
&gt;1. Is is better to adjust the spring under load (i.e. while driving) or 
&gt;with the bus stopped?
&gt;2. Should I adjust the idle mixture before or after adjusting the cruising 
&gt;speed mixture?
&gt;
&gt;I figured that I should adjust cruising speed mixture (the spring) first 
&gt;and that I should do it with the bus driving. I did manage to lean it some, 
&gt;but I found that based on load, throttle position and speed, my mixture did 
&gt;vary. I got it leaned to about 650 mv at the sensor most of the time, but 
&gt;there were some times that the mixture would go to 100 mv for a little 
&gt;while. Also, under full throttle, it would still go to 800 mv.
&gt;
&gt;3. Is this normal? Should I worry that it sometimes goes to 100 mv?
&gt;
&gt;Thanks much,
&gt;
&gt;Mark
&gt;'78 'blue bus'
