Subject: Re: Turn Signal Stalk

&gt; On the way home from our company xmas party last night the stalk just
&gt; went limp. It flops around now and does nothing. So I'd like a visual
&gt; of what I'm getting into before I take things apart.

I finally got to pull the steering wheel off today. It came off super
easy once I got the nut off. No banging required.

This is what it looked like when I pulled the steering wheel off. Yep,
that clip thing was just setting there.

You can sort of see the broken pot metal in that shot.

Definitely broken. :( I covered the shaft and threads with grease so
it'll come apart even easier when I get the $$ for a turnsignal.
Bentley's directions for pulling it apart weren't all that great.
&quot;Disconnect. Unscrew. Lift.&quot; Gee, thanks. Heh.
