Double Cargo Door Bus .. by Phillip Gerry_at_SunBelt.Ne 
&gt; 
&gt; Free to Good Home, 1959 Double Cargo Door Bus. Have most of the parts 
&gt; including the original engine. The bus is in need of restoration but is very 
&gt; solid. All glass is in good shape, and body rust is minimal. I hate to part 
&gt; with this but I have just purchased a new Impala SS and need my garage. The 
&gt; bus is located in Augusta, GA.
