Subject: pilot bearing info needed

Engine is out. Subject is a 1972 1.7 liter CB engien code. Removal of clutch
brought out some needles from the pilot bearing. A review of Bentley
suggests that the pilot bearing is pressed into flywheel hub. Flywheel is
removed by the loosening of the 5 bolts holding it to the crankshaft.
However there does not seem to be a clear procedure for replaceing the pilot
bearing. 

Bus Depot lists part#111 105 313A as &quot;pilot shaft needle bearing '72-83
bus/vanogon.&quot; Is this the only part necessary. Is it as simple as removing
the flywheel, inserting the bearing from the rear of flywheel and
reinstalling?
