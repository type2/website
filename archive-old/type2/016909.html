Subject: Downsizing?

Okay, Maureen is a 72, she's got a 2L with Weber single carb and some
horrendous sort of juryrigged intake manifold.  All that was put in by the
PO.  The engine needs a rebuild; may just be the valves but I'll probably go
whole hog --  if I do it.

I'm thinking:  in addition to the rebuild I'll have to get dual carbs as the
single carb is medium-crappy.  And a rebuild is a bunch o' work, another
project on my list of 581 things I wanna do.  And I'm not sure how good a
job I could do.  Yeah, I know, the book says even an idiot can do it.
Problem is I'm not an idiot... :-)

I keep thinking about a 1.6 L from Beetlemex.  It would cost $500-1000 more
than a rebuild, but the idea of a brand-spanking new engine is seductive.  I
really wouldn't mind the loss of power; though I'll be using her as a daily
driver eventually, it's only 45 mph speed limit and about five miles round
trip.   And I'm much calmer and more sedate in driving the bus anyway (if'n
I'd wanted to go fast, I'd'a got me a Pinto...)

So:  is it possible?  And what sort of problems might arise in this sort of
downsizing operation?

Thanks all,
P'rfesser
