Subject: Clutch probs 75 Kombi

OK I'm driving to work, late (as usual), in the rain, and about 3 kms from 
work my clutch no longer functioned. I suspect a snapped cable because the 
clutch pedal is sitting flat to the floor. 

I haven't checked it out yet but will have a look tonight after work. I am 
wondering if this is a simple job, that one can bear in the cold rain in a 
city car park, or if I should abuse my gearbox a bit and drive it either home 
or straight to the mechanic....

The PO left me with a spare cable of some kind - so I am hoping it is for the 
clutch :-)

Any tips or traps that are not in the standard manuals would be greatly 
appreciated.

I am also wondering whether it would be wise to change the gearbox oil, 
because having ground them a bit there is probably  some extra metal floating 
around in there.

TIA
