Subject: Brosol 30/31vs Solex 34

Hello List,

I would be interested in hearing from anyone who was using a Solex Pict 34 -3
on a 1600 DP and downsized to a Brosol 30/31 -3 using their adapter flange. 
I was wondering if you experienced any impacts on performance , gas mileage or unplanned mechanical issues after the downsizing. 

Thanks for your help,

Joe Delecki
