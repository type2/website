Joe,

I just got hold of a set of remanufactured '71 calipers through MOFOCO.
They had a hard time finding them, but did, and I got them for a fair
(maybe too fair) price.  I was working on my bus this past weekend and
only got one side done (calipers, pads, bearing repack, brake line).  I
have to return the cores to them to get my $$ back.  Maybe they can
remanufacture mine and sell them to you!  If you call them, ask for
Bruce as he seems to know what's going on more than some of the other
employees.  Good Luck!

&gt; Here's the deal. If'n I can get the spindles off a later year, I can get the calipers for a '77 in this package deal I'm putting together. Otherwise, I need the calipers off a '71 or '72.
&gt; 
&gt; If any of you are parting out a '71 or '72 bus, please keep me in mind. I appreciate it! Joe
