Subject: Helicoil Life?

Hey Volks,

Not specifically bus-related, but I was wondering how long a helicoil
fix for a spark plug should last?

My transportation appliance needed a helicoil for the plug about a
year ago; a local shop put one in (w/o pulling the head; aluminum head
BTW.)  When I tried to change the plugs, the helicoil came out, stuck
to the old plug they put in. (Really stuck.)

I talked to the shop today, &amp; they said it was only a temp. fix, &amp; I
should expect to have to change helicoils each time I changed plugs.
They also said they wouldn't guarantee it, or fix this under a
guarantee.  What do you think?  I understand that putting a helicoil
in w/o pulling the head means they can't fasten it in as well, but it
seems like I should still be able to change plugs...

What are your experiences?  Should I take this to a different shop &amp;
see what they can do?
