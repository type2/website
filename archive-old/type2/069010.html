&gt;Bob Wallace, the original postee, adjusted his and cured a wicked stal
ling problem. Perhaps I can do the same.

I had no carb preheat hose hooked up on my '73 Beetle at all and I
never had this stalling problem for any of the 3 years I owned it.
(even at 12 degrees F., started and ran just fine)
Now I have a '69 Westy with an IDENTICAL setup (save the 009) as 
the Beetle and I can't keep it from stalling...

Is the 009 really that big a piece of crapola?  Could it be causing 
my otherwise normal 1600 DP to stall in the cold?  If so, someone
point me at a good vacuum unit ASAP!!!

Cruising in Knoxvegas,

'69 Westfalia

What's the deal here
