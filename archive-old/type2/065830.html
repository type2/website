Subject: Gas Heater Installation tips (General)

The following info didn't help Jay with his installation migh might be
useful to someone installing a heater similar to mine.

I installed a late model (70's Super Beetle I think) German heater in my 64
Double Cab.  It is a cannister type with a German name.  I mounted it under
my back seat.

The following info might be considered 'General'.  Use it if you can.

On my heater:

There are two 12V hot circuits for the heater.
1.)  The fuel pump and ignition are on one circuit.....getting juice only
when the key is on.  They are also switched up front..I'm using a
toggle...you might have the stock switch.

2.)  The fan is hooked into your vehicle's circuit which stays hot all the
time.  This is so the fan can keep running to cool of the heater.  It is on
a local thermostat so it will shut off when it's ready.

The fuel line I hooked via a 'tee' just below my gas tank.
I positioned the heater so that the air intake, exhaust, fuel line, and
wiring all exits thru the floorboard underneath &amp; next to the heater.  I
sheathed all the wiring in rubber hose and used grommets in the floor board.

The exhaust needs to be very well sealed at the floorboard.  I cut some
sheet metal 'halves' that fit right up flush to the exhaust pipe and overlap
each other.  I then riveted these to the floorboard.

The air intake (once under the floorboard) needs to be routed well away and
forward of the exhaust.  I used full flex radiator hose and PVC pipe for this.

I routed the heated air output thru my stock heater ducts....from under the
floorboard forward to front of truck.  This killed a lot of the &quot;oomph&quot; so
it re-routed it out one large vent below my rear bench seat.  Way better
overall....but no defrost.

Important safety concern:

If you decide to bench test your heater to make sure it works, make sure it
is in the proper 'upright' position.  I set mine up at the wrong angle and
flaming gasoline poured out the exhast onto the floor.

If set up correctly they are very safe and definately kick ass.


Good luck
