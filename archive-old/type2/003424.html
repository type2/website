I did this last year.  Yes,  it'll help to have access by taking the little
circle thing off but I could not have done mine with out taking out the fire
wall.  I can do this with out dropping the engine because my two bottom
screws are no longer in place- and if I bend the upper engine tin out
enough, I can pull the fire wall out.
 I would also think about replacing the hose that connects to the tank and
filler neck also.  This part is no longer available and I used a strait
piece of gas rated line from my FLAPS  to do the job. I detailed this
procedure that I'm guessing is still in the archives.  If not, I'll give you
a more detailed account.

&gt; Hello listmembers,
&gt;
&gt; I am just about through with rolling down my windows every time I take a
&gt; sharp turn full a full tank of gas. That smell is driving me crazy.
&gt;
&gt; I have been bugging my mechanic to replace the fuel filler neck forever
now,
&gt; and he is seemingly always to backed up and our schedules never jive,
which
&gt; is important since the bus is my daily driver.
&gt;
&gt; Im now thinking about the days off I have coming up, and figure I may as
&gt; well attack this myself. But, what is involved in this?
&gt; My Haynes doesn't really give any details on this area of the bus, and
what
&gt; im getting myself into. When I take the gas cap off, I can see those 4
&gt; screws that hold the neck in place, but im curious how this fits over the
&gt; rest of the fuel neck thingy. Am I going to have to get into this area
&gt; another way, or can I just pull it off from the outside of the bus and
slip
&gt; the new one over it?
&gt;
&gt; I see that little circle thing behind the airbox, and im guessing that is
&gt; some kind of access to that area, but I dont want to go pulling anything
out
&gt; of there until I know for sure how big of a hole im digging here.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; on the other hand, if you are in the Bay Area and have any experience with
&gt; this, i'll bring the Red Stripe. =)
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Thanks for any tips or hints you can throw my way!
&gt;
