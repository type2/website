Hi  folks,

My thanks to those of you who responded to my request for an original price
for a 68 Type 2 my insurer seems happy and I am enjoying the type 2
instructional?? e-mails :-))

I have a new &quot;small problem&quot; I need a Passengerside Windshield Wiper Arm for
a 68 bus.
I have checked Bus-boys and they no longer hold stock. I have been looking
for a week and still cannot locate a wiper arm. I am  reluctant to follow
Bus-boys advice and change the wiper shaft, as there is nothing wrong with
the current item.
Does anybody out there have a spare 68 type wiper arm or know where one may
be obtained?

Yours hopefully Russ
