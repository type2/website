Subject: Oh no, another TIRE question!

List,
     I know, tire questions are tough, and probably too often asked.  I 
couldn't find anything like this in the archives though.  I have heard that 
205's are a bit big for the bus because it affects steering.  It makes it 
harder to steer in parking lots and puts extra wear on the steering box.  
Could I run 205's or even 215's on the back, and then normal 195's or 185's 
in the front?  This makes sense to me since there is all that engine weight 
there and it would seem to make for better traction (at least on dry days) 
yet would not affect steering, of course, I don't know as much as you guys 
so please correct me if I am wrong :-)  If this would be a good idea, what 
is the biggest I could/would want to go in the back?

Thanks,
Jay
