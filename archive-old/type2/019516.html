X-Diagnostic: MESSAGE MAY NOT BE TOPICAL

While it's out, were money (and time) no object, I'd replace the hanger bar
motor mounts, the oil gallery plugs (all of 'em, not just the one behind the
flywheel) with 3/8&quot; pipe plugs, entire clutch pack and t/o bearing, trans
input shaft seal, FUEL LINES!!!, rear seal (the one on the OTHER end of the
crank, the one that's leaking on my motor), take a buffer to the fan housing
and shine it up pretty, thermostat and cable, flywheel seal, pull the tin and
REALLY clean the motor, etc, etc, etc.

Oh, what the heck, time and money are no object, split the cases and have the
who;e thing balanced...  the list goes on! ;o)

&gt;      My question is, if money were no object (and of course it is, but
&gt; just for the sake of knowledge!), what would you check or replace as long
&gt; as the engine was already out?  I'd hate to discover two months from now
&gt; I had to pull the thing again for some standard maintenance item I just
&gt; didn't know to worry about.
