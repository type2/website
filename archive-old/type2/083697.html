Subject: speakers

in my 74 I installed:
2 speakers in the front kickboards with
plastic over them from the back (spray glue 3M)
in case of water. You loose the water tank for
the windshield washer... I've never used it anyway..
I use Rain X &lt;sp?&gt;

4 speakers in the panel of the back hatch (installed
a third eye brake light at the same time). I had to
fab a new panel with a bit of a stand off for the
panel so the speakers would fit. In other words the
panel sticks out a little more than the stock one
would. I didnt put a booster amp back there but you
could easily. Kinda nice when you are putting gas in
das bus and you can at least still hear the tunes
while you're standing there. :-)

  Sound deadening would be my next project.. always
something!
