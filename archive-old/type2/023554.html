Subject: Brazilian aircooled busses
To: type2_at_lenti.type2_dot_com

Having read the archives on this topic, I have one question still 
unanswered...What do these things cost new down there? Anyone gotten that far 
on a &quot;rogue imort&quot; plan?

Cheers/Don Carron

&gt; The water-cooled busses sold in Mexico are made in
&gt;  Brasil. They also build air-cooled ones for the home
&gt;  market. Your choice of gas or alcohol.
