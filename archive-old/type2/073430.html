But of course.  You are one of the high order of bus owners... highROOF
order that is.  :)  Welcome, brother Ethridge...

&gt;Ive removed the fridge, actually the whole interior, of BLUE. What I noticed
&gt;is that i have a aux? batt on the driverside in the engine compartment. the
&gt;lines run straight to where the fridge was. No surprise there. My ? is now
&gt;that I have these two leads coming from the 2nd batt into the hull, what can
&gt;I do with them? Id hate to waste the X tra power.

Are you going to put the fridge back?  If not, you could use it to run
extra interior lights, power some cigarette lighter outlets, etc.

&gt;I have a ford solenoid?
&gt; is that what its called) that I believe helps to charge this 2nd batt off
&gt;of the first.

It looks like a plain-old Ford solenoid but it is actually a
continuous-duty version.

&gt;ANYHOO, are there any &quot; YOU NEED THIS IN YOUR
&gt;CAMPER!!&quot; items that I can run off of this batt that I cant think of?

Yeah, an inverter.  Loads of fun!  A good beginning inverter would be in
the 300 watt range.  If you go higher than that you will start having to
think about a bigger auxiliary battery.
