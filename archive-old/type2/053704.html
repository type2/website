Subject: FREE!!! bus seats from a 71

hi, I just replaced the seats in my 71 westy and the old seats need to
go.  They are the non-headrest type and will need new covers and
stuffing.  I will gladly give them to anyone who needs them.  I am in
Maplewood NJ (near 78, parkway, turnpike)  I will be throwing them away
in a week or two if no one wants them.  Thanks, Brian
