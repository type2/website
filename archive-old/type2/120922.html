Subject: Re: [T2] Rebuild vs. LongBlock

I spent about 1400 so far on my type4 rebuild.  That included line bore, 
grinding the crank, heads cleaned up (bead blasted, valves, etc), 
tapping oil galley plugs, crank, flywheel, pressure plate, and fan 
balanced, new pistons and cylinders, pistons and rods balanced to .5g, 
all new cam, rod, and crank bearings and new cam/lifters/gear.  I pretty 
much had Rimco do everything they could to the case, heads, and crank 
that they could.

I would find out exactly what's going into the engine as far as what's 
new and what's used.  Obviously, yes, there is an advantage to having 
your mechanic do it, however, it hasn't been that particularly difficult 
to rebuild mine... and it's been quite enjoyable, too ;)

Hope that helps,
Mike

&gt;   This is a Friday question.  I am looking for opinions of rebuilding vs.
&gt; purchasing a long block.  Rebuild costs seems to be within $100 or $200 of the
&gt; cost of a rebuilt longblock, so, is it worth it to do the rebuild.  There is a
&gt; VW shop near me that has specialized in VW's since the 1960's.  I was told
&gt; that machine shop work would average about $500 to $600 for the average
&gt; engine.  Then I would have to purchase the necessary bearings, pistons,
&gt; cylinders, gaskets, etc etc to complete the rebuild.  This same shop has
&gt; rebuilt engines (each one is rebuilt by the owner of the shop) for $850.   So,
&gt; other than gaining experience, what am I saving by
