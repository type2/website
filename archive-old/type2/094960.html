Jon Syder

&gt;Further to this, I have used carbide Dremel bits ground (diamond grinding
&gt;wheel) into a spade drill shape (flat with a wide angle between the
&gt;cutting edges-look at a concrete drill)  Used in a RIGID drill press (mill
&gt;is better) with HEAVY CONSTANT pressure these will go through taps/easy
&gt;outs and most fubars. Usually surprisingly easily.  Buy a few as they are
&gt;inexpensive and somewhat brittle.  Shown to me by a very knowledgeable
&gt;machinist/teacher after I had broken a tap at the end of a long and
&gt;complex machining operation.  Much better than slitting your wrists and
&gt;lots cheaper than EDM.

This is getting better and better. Thanks Jon.

Chuck
