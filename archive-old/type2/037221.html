 I managed to forget to hook up the sending wire to the new fuel sender in
the
&gt; tank.    It's lazy, but if anyone has a
&gt; minimally invasive method (with dimensions) of getting a wire on the
sender,
&gt; I guess I'd be willing to drill the hole in from either side.  Sheesh.

This works for early bays, to access the fuel sender without pulling the
motor and tank cover.  I understand VW actually did this and sold a seal to
cover the hole.  From the rear, on the metal deck, measure from the left
trim panel just behind the back seat toward the middle 31&quot;.  Measure from
where the deck just starts down frontward toward the rear 1.5&quot;.  This is the
center point of a 3-3.5&quot; hole you cut with a hole saw.  Attach the wire and
plug the hole with the item of your choice. (I used a kitchen sink stopper,
ha).  Now you are set when your sender craps out. (count on it, it will).
