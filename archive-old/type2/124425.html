Subject: Re: [T2] 74 Westy Stool and veggie bus update

FWIW the 76 brochure calls it &quot;an upholstered storage box, that can be used 
as an extra seat when dining&quot; and the 77 brochure calls it an &quot;upholstered 
storage container&quot;. These are obviously the later Westies and the 74 
brochure doesn't elaborate. However my thoughts are that if it were a trash 
can why would you need to be in an upholstered cabinet? And if it were just 
a storage container why would you need a plastic bucket inside of it?

I am not sure what Westfalia really intended, but I imagine the salesguys 
probably said something to the effect that it could be used as a toilet in a 
pinch.

Call it what you want, use it as you like.

Glad Petunia made it home ok!
