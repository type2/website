There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio, than are dreamt of in
your philosophy. 
     William Shakespeare, Hamlet, I, v, 166. 

VW made 3 different variants of the &quot;light bulb test&quot; for the dual circuit
test light that I know of.  I have owned two and heard of a third.

The first variant, that the bulb llights when you press the &quot;B&quot; was
installed on a 1971 stupid beetle I owned; 

The second variant, that the bulb lights when the parking brake lever is
pulled, was installed in a 1978 bus I owned;

The third variant, that the light comes on when the starter is operated,
is mentioned in my Bentley manual, but I have not seen this variant.

Are there fourth, fifth and sixth variants?  There may well be.  Until you
have owned buses of all years in all the countries that VW sold buses in,
it is not a safe thing to assume that an option was never installed.
