Subject: Re: [T2] Poptop seen in snowbusses site

 I believe you are mistaken. It is in fact a Dormobile conversion there where 
three different type roofs used by devon to my Knowledge the pop top to witch 
you refer (so called because it pops straight up) there was also a side 
hinged roof which could accommodate four sleepers, and allowed more room for 
cooking etc. If you look very closely at the picture you can see the round 
vents in the roof which Devon's don&quot;t have but Dormobiles do!
Also they fitted some roofs made by Richard Holdsworthy which was also a pop 
top but larger than the more common 'Devon' roof.  
Now who has the two folding bunks inside them is it Martin and is this 
reallky common? 
 quote&quot;  Not a guess but i can tell you that its a Devon (as in J.P.White of
Sidmouth,Devon England)pop-top on my friend Tony's camper-most definately
not a dormy roof as they were made by Martin Walters and were side
hinged-this one goes straight up(ie bellows all round the fibre glass top
with cantelever springs puushing it up from the inside).This type of roof is
reallky common in England and has two folding bunks inside-Martin&quot;
