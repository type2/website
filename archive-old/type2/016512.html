Subject: I need a bus

Im looking for a VW Westfalia to restore.  Any year will do, but i
prefer 68-78.  Early Vanagon will work, Waterboxers need not apply.  I
live in Massachusetts so the bus would have to be in the New England
area.  Minimal rust and a decent interior exterior are wanted.  Needs to
have an engine that is running or in rebuildable shape.  Thanks!

ps- for my engine rebuild.  What is the opinion on the effect of
painting the case a dark color?

Thanks

(1973 VW Superbeetle 2200cc)
