Subject: Re: [T2] generator light....




&gt; If the brushes are wearing out that fast I would suspect the armature is worn
&gt; roughly from the old brushes. The best way to repair is to disassemble the
&gt; generator and torn the armature on a lathe to true up the contact surface. In a
&gt; pinch I've disassembled and used crocus cloth on the contact surface. Make sure
&gt; everything is clean before you reassemble with new brushes. Hope this helps.

&gt; &gt; Hey,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I have put new generator brushes in the top part of my generator about 2
&gt; &gt; weeks ago.  That stopped the generator light from going on.  Then it started
&gt; &gt; to come back on three days ago.  I put in new bottom generator brushes.  the
&gt; &gt; springs seem to be pretty tight. and the generator light went out again. so
&gt; &gt; yesterday I was christmas shopping and the generator light went on again.
&gt; &gt; High revs would not bring it off.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I checked the brushes and they are almost warn down already.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; So, I have put in a new regulator about 1year ago and a generator is 5 years
&gt; &gt; at least.
&gt; &gt; How do I tell if the generator is bad....should i suspect the regulator?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Anything else??  This is my daily driver....need to fix soon.
