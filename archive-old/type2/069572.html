Then Steve Johnson remarked:

&gt;Wow Lee!  You actually 'bought' one of those?  Every one I've ever seen
&gt;is plugged somewhere between the exhaust and the EGR valve.

Well,  I thought I had to.  I knew I had a smog inspection due in a few
months and that under the new rules, the emission controls had to not only
be in place, but actually *work*.  Although the part that shows in the
engine compartment looked just fine, the cannister below was completely
rotted through.  As it turns out, the technician who smogged the engine
last week admitted to me that [he thinks] this is one of the few EGR valves
that can't be tested.  So he just automatically passed me. [...sign]

I consider the money invested in a cooler-running  and possible
longer-lived engine.
