Subject: the new engine trip report... Driving it, being there, and breaking down.

Continuing...
	I didn't have my strobe light on me and since i have a 009 distributor,
retarded it until I could get another timing gun... Cruised by WalMart
before leaving, got one, and set the timing in their parking lot
somewhere in the 28-32 degree total advance area...
	I also left the valves a little loose for the initial run... 
	&lt;3rd person mode ON&gt; And so, Jason hit the road... taking it very easy
and varying his speed. He wished that he had hooked up his heat fully as
the hours dragged on and his core body temperature got lower. He had
been up all of Friday night though, and needed the cold to keep him
awake... especially since the bus made slow, semi-boring progress in the
hills of TN and NC. ...he had also neglected to put a good stereo in it. 
	Near hypothermia, he arrived at the LEAF festival... and was able to
secure a volunteer position to take care of the cost of his camping and
ticket. He was also able to find a few people to help him push start the
bus... apparently his mismatched starter/flywheel were a little much for
the tiny battery to handle at that point. 
	So he meandered up to the wild people's camping area... car camping for
the wilder types, far away from the more family-oriented sites. On his
way up, he gave a ride to some guy who was walking to the top, having
been disappointed with the sedate quality of the lower camping area the
previous night. Jason parked his bus, and the other guy's bus was soon
parked alongside... they spent an hour figuring out the best way to rig
a tarp between the buses for a hangout/shade area. 
	Instead of sleeping a lot before his work time was to come, Jason
instead stayed up discussing buses and the like with the H2O Westy
owner... heads, hydraulics, full-flow, etc... then he caught a
semi-induced nap and overslept a little for his work... showed up late
and worked over to get the hours in, manning a car gate/wristband
checkpoint for 4 hours. 
	After this, he went to the mainstage area and got some veggie stir fry
that was, at best, mediocre. 
	He was very tired at this point, having been awake for the better part
of a full day... so he went back to the bus to sleep. Then he remembered
the drum circle. That's really why he came. So, after a gracious
donation from his neighbor of mushrooms ground up and suspended in honey
(adding this oddly to instant oatmeal), he grabbed his drum and headed
for the circle. It was intense, as he remembered it had been in the
past. After a while, though, he got very tired and began the long climb
up the hill away from the circle. 
	When he got to the top of the hill, he felt different, as if the
tiredness had been lifted from him. He walked back to the bus and fired
up his wee german propane stove for the warmth and the eerie blue light
emanating from the burners. After several more hours of hanging out and
watching things, he went to sleep.
	Upon waking, he set about doing little bus-tasks... adjusting the
valves, installing the heater hoses in place of the plugs he had put in
the fan shroud, but little else other than that. He then went for a
veggie burrito (decent) before the last 4 hour shift, which was more of
the same work.
	After turning in his work card, he hit the interstate... and within 15
minutes was stalled at the side of the road. He went back and took the
plug off of the carb bowl and was greeted with: nothing. Fuel pump
problem...
	So he laid down the Z-bed and took a long nap from 5:30 to 9:00... woke
up and changed into some more conservative jeans and boots for the walk
back to the last exit. ...found a gas station and, 45 minutes later, was
talking to a one-handed AAA wrecker driver. wild. &lt;3rd person mode OFF&gt;
I was hoping to get one of those little low-pressure fuel pumps from
someone, but that was not to be.
	So i got towed 118 miles back to Knoxville... 18 of which i had to pay
for since I had AAA Plus. $36, plus a fat tip. &lt;rant mode on&gt; Think
about how many people tip the pizza delivery drivers a bunch, but rarely
does a wrecker driver ever get a tip, though your pride and joy bus may
arrive through unknown perils unscathed... and that's way more deserving
of a reward than bringing anyone a pizza safely, IMHO. &lt;rant mode off&gt;
	So at about 12:30 Sunday night i started the repairs... the big parts
place on 5th Avenue in Knoxville had given me the wrong pushrod for the
alternator-style pump... and this led to the pump's demise. This I
figured out because it was only .005&quot; longer than the old one I took off
of the old motor... that had the non-alternator pump with one threaded
fitting, one push-on fitting, and the circular fuel filter screen under
the top cover. I reinstalled the old pump and pushrod... after cleaning
the screen and making another screen gasket to replace the one that
broke when i removed the screen.
	I then used a 1/2&quot; tap to remove the old starter bushing... a pain, but
it's better than pulling the engine, IMHO. After some cleaning up, the
6V starter and adapter bushing went in easily... and the engine was
started without the awful noise previously heard, albeit a bit faster.
	So.. I plan on carrying a few more spares in the bus... cheaper than
towing, anytime. That, and rejetting the 30 PICT-3 really soon... it
doesn't have quite the power it should in the hills and runs a tad warm
for me.

Thanks...
