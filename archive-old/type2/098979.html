&gt;I disassembled a 2liter some shop in FL had rebuilt.the Po of the motor

evidence of anything wrong.......rods good side/side, and end play was ok.  
&gt;
&gt;I think the rebuilder may have used the wrong sized bearings here are the
numbers off the bearings.  This case did not appear to have been align-bored.
&gt;
&gt;ANY ONE HAVE ANY INFO ON THESE P/N?
&gt;
&gt;Main ...021 105 537E..has a vw symbol, a Skoda symbol, and a elephant
symbol.......
&gt;
&gt;Rod   039 105 707 and above it is 025 vw symbol on this bearing too.  Does
this mean 25 under on the crank journals?
&gt;
&gt;I dropped the crank and rods at the machine shop to see what the real deal
is with them.
