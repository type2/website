Subject: Type III Ghia-Reason for Insanity?

Type IIers:

Can I talk Type III here?  It *is* still VW-related.

I found an ad for a '64 Type 3 Ghia, $1000, no rust, rebuilt
engine, needs interior work.  I've been a glutten for Type II
punishment for several decades now.  Would I be insane to take on
finding hen's teeth parts for one of these?
