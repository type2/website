Subject: Life of the generator

Just wondering...  I have been push starting my bus lately a bit more than
I'd like to.  I know the battery is good. I haven't checked the brushes
(yet) on the generator because the red idiot light never comes on. 

Question: can the charging system fail before the light comes on? Can you
adjust the threshold voltage at which this light turns on?
