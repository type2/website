Subject: Changed my brake fluid and now I have NO brakes, what did I
  miss??? - FIXED for $5

I got one of this little $5 do-it-yourself bleeder at Harbor Freight, got
home and bled the only part that I did not do yesterday - the front TOP
(thanks for nothing Bentley). Got then all done, and I was good to go.

Feels good to know I can stop again...

'75 2.0L Riviera Penthouse - Zoey

The greatest single cause of atheism in the world today is Christians, who
acknowledge Jesus with their lips and walk out the door, and deny Him by
their lifestyle. That is what an unbelieving world simply finds
unbelievable.
