Subject: upgraded to Halogens

Hey all,
Tonight I found that one of the headlights on my '78 was burned out, so
I went to Wal-Mart to see if they had what I needed.  The manual calls
for #6014, and after checking the local parts store I determined that
6014 incandescent aren't readily available, both the FLAPS and Wal-Mart
had instead H6024, which is a drop-in halogen replacement for 6014.  I
got the GE from Wal-Mart as they were cheaper than the Wagner at FLAPS.
The low beam is 35 watts and the high beam is 65 watts.  They're pretty
nice (I did both of them, I was meaning to upgrade anyway and I didn't
want one headlight brighter than the other), nice and bright with a more
focused beam.  They were almost $9 each tho, we'll see if they were
worth it.  

Sean
