Subject: Re: [T2] My 77 is a leaker.

I found a rubber strap wrench to be quite ehlpful when I replaced my pushrod seals. It almost felt like cheating tho, cuz i had the engine flipped upside down on the stand. ;-)

Now, make a list of all the cuss words you know! the push rod tubes often do 
not want to budge without the use of foul language, muscle, and sweat. Turn 
the tubes while at the same time pulling them toward the head. Avoid using 
vice grips or pliers of any kind if possible. You don't want to dent or tear 
the tubes. One of those rubber strap wrenches might help but I have never 
had to resort to that. the Viton seals are the way to go!
