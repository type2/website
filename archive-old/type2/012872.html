&gt; this is where the dip stick is if it were from a 914 Porsche, and ALSO on
&gt; a 411/412 sedan/fastback.  411/412 station wagen had rear dipstick like
&gt; bus. 

It must be a 914 motor. 
I decided I'd better order a tempiture sensing dip stick from gene berg. I
guess I'll just change the oil again and mark it from there. 

Does anyone know the compression ration of this motor? Will 91 octane be
required or even enof? On the type I motor Gene Berg recommends 6.5
compression ration for 87 octane fuel, does this also hold true of Type IV
fuel injected motors?

&gt; what is the engine code????

Where do i find it, I looked at every exposed piece of engine i can find
and can't seem to find it, (it mite be under some grease). I looked in my
Bentley manual and i can't find where its at in there either.

thanks again
