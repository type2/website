The new search interface is 70% complete and now available for preview!  I
am moving servers and Internet connections this weekend so I have it at a
temporary URL:

  http://vwarchive.roundsparrow_dot_com/

Again, THAT IS A TEMPORARY URL and it is intended for this weekend only.
You are welcome to try the new search engine interface, just understand that
some of the new features are still being worked on.

The new server does NOT have the intermittent &quot;access denied&quot; problem that
was on the old server... YEN!

Please email me directly if you have problems with the archives.

Thank you,
