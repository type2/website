&gt; &gt; I would rather drive without the clutch (except starting and stopping)
&gt; &gt; as you get a feel for the engine and gearbox speeds and of course it
&gt; &gt; saves wear on the clutch and the cable.

&gt; --&gt;  Someone told me once that driving like this on a regular basis would
&gt; wear out the syncros in the transmission.  Any truth to this?  It'd
&gt; certainly seem a false economy to wear them out just to save the clutch
&gt; disc.

David:
I'm sure you're right, if it's making any jerking or lurching or
GRINDING at all, it's really not very good for the synchro rings or the
sleeves or the engagement teeth on the gears. I do this driving without
the clutch at my tranny's peril and only because I'm a little nuts (some
would say more than a little). It IS a challenge, though!
