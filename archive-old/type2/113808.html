Subject: air bound lifter

good morning folks, I was to take my 79 camper to the body shop this 
morning, cranked it up, slight tapping, most of it quieted down except for 
#2 exhaust.  Never would quiet down.  I limped back to my garage, pulled 
the 1-2 valve cover and #2 exhaust was not opening at all.  adjusted screw 
in a little bit and valve started opening properly,(though not much). It's 
been 4 days since bus was cranked.  I couldn't get the lifter to pump 
up.  I pressed the bottom of the rocker arm and it was very spongy.  Is 
there anything I can do short of removing the lifter and bench bleeding 
it?  I'm distraught.  tx, greg
