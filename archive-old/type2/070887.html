Subject: carb problem
To: type2_at_type2_dot_com

I have a 72 bus with a single double barrel carb on it.  Well everytime I 
completly let off the gas it back fires (sometimes quiet sometimes very 
loud).  My mechanic made some adjustments the best he could yet it still does 
it just not as much. He said because it is not a VW carb that when I let off 
the gas it completly shuts of gas flow to the carb making it back fire on the 
remaining gas in the carb.  He said it can't be fixed just adjusted every now 
and then to minimize the back firing but never stopping it.  Is this true?

Thank You,
Jon
72 Bus
