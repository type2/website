&gt;My take on &quot;reliability&quot; is that if the vehicle gets you where you're going,
&gt;when you want it to, then it's &quot;reliable.&quot;  If parts are replaced when those
&gt;crafty Germans say they should (DM), then they are most unlikely to fail
&gt;under use.

If maintenance is adequate, no breakdowns can occur. Weaknesses are noted 
and fixed before failure.


&gt;So which car is more &quot;reliable&quot;?


The better the maintenance, the better the reliability, regardless the 
time/miles.
