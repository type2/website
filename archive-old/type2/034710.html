Subject: Head rests

As the veteran of two head on crashes (no, didn't cause either and yes, both
cars were totalled), it makes me nervous tooling around in my bus with no
head rests.  My PO cobbled together a set and fitted them to the stock
seats, but they were so lame I took them off.  It's a nice clean look, but
I'm pretty fond of my neck vertebra, and walking in particular.  What have
others done to fill the gap and still have stock seats?
