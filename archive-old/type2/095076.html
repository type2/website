Subject: fuel breather part needed!

Hello,

This would be too hard to describe, so here are a couple of images.
The first is a picture of what I have, and the second id a graph showing all 
of the parts that should be there.

Anyone have a spare parts bus, or know of a location where I could aquire 
the parts I am missing here?
