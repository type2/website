&gt;       Hey Type 2 owners,
&gt;   I recently purchased a 1973 Bus. It's still a work
&gt; in progress. The one thing that eludes me is, the name
&gt; for the bus. It's not a Kombi, Westy, or Camper.
&gt; Here's a brief body description: On the Driver's side
&gt; there's no panel with windows. In other words there's
&gt; no windows on that side, it's all paneled off. Every
&gt; dealer of parts and mechanics I've talked to have
&gt; never seen one of these before. And personally I've
&gt; never seen one either. If anyone knows the proper VW
&gt; name for my bus, let me know please. Thanks.

Phil:
Are there windows on the passenger side? If no windows, it's a panel,
type 211 (?). If there  are windows in the right quarter and not the
left, probably someone other than the factory made it that way! (It's
quite a simple job to put a sliding door with a window on a panel and
the factory may have even offered that as an M-code.)
Comercial vehicles were not imported into the US after 1971 (as a result
of the &quot;chicken war- tarrif wars&quot;) and that included single cabs (261),
double cabs (265), panels (211) or ambulances (274). Any such vehicles
in the US later than 71's were probably grey-market cars.
I'm guessing you're in the US, but I may be wrong! Such a vehicle would
not be all that uncommon in the UK or European continent.
