I was very fortunate growing up as my father bought a new Westie in
1969 and we made three trips to Canada and back before he traded for a
F*** Sportsmobile because the VW was to slow.  
During the school year, most weekends were spent camping on a piece of
land we owned in East Texas. Some times my friends and I would
&quot;campout&quot; in the driveway on Friday nights.
As I tell my friends with kids, &quot;get 'em out in the woods before it's
too late!&quot;
