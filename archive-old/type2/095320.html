Subject: Lonely '71 Westy still needs a family


My '71 Westy is still sitting in a Northern California driveway, waiting for 
someone to adopt her.  She doesn't have paneling held on by sheet-metal 
screws.  She doesn't even have any holes('cept under the drivers floormat) 
or major dents anywhere.  She doesn't even sag in the rearend.  I've already 
had to hide her in the backyard to keep from being towed away(an this is in 
a mixed-ethnicity neighborhood), and it's just a matter of time before this 
happens again.  I'm not saying I will do anything drastic...(long 
pause)...but, I have to move this vehicle somewhere, and soon.  Please 
P-Mail me if you're ready for a Westy adoption, or just curious about the 
condition of the vehicle.  Reasonable offers and trades will be considered.

	Eron
