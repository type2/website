Subject: RE:  Locking gap cap - 74-79 Chrome Avail. Again.

While we're on the subject of locking chrome gas caps, I just received a
long-awaited shipment of 74-79 ones directly from Germany. These have been
NLA for several years, at least at a sane price.  (Technically they were not
'discontinued' via the VW dealer network, but there was little or no actual
inventory and the price was absurd.)

Price is $29.95
