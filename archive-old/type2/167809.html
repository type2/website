&gt;I keep a timing light too, but only use it to make sure that the vacuum
&gt;advance is working properly.
&gt;
&gt;In fact, I usually check timing without a meter of any sort.  Turn
&gt;ignition on, turn engine slowly toward TDC, listen for the light &quot;snap&quot; of
&gt;the spark and see where the timing mark is when I hear it.  Works great!

	If your condensor etc are optimised so that the spark is too 
small to hear, take advantage of the fact that even a tiny inaudible 
spark emits 'white' radio.  Just slap an AM radio a few ' away, 
switched on &amp; turned up 'loud' off all stations.  You'll hear the 
spark on that.
