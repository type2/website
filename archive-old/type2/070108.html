&gt; Specific piece in Question:
&gt; Piece(s) on drivers side wall, below the windows and behind the
&gt; bench divider and back to the D.S. wheel well.
&gt; Questions:
&gt; 1. Is the wood paneling one piece or two?

Before you heat up enough to combust from friction or from
something else...oops, wrong thread...the location you describe
is TWO, TWO, TWO pieces in one.  At least it is in my '67......

side (LHD).  So, the sadists at Westfalia probably did what you
propose...mirror image the cargo door side on the driver side.
No chemical application required.  The seam is not hidden.

jim, your wood was replaced, it was a single piece from the westfalia werks.
   

another pervert trinket - 67s used phillips head screws on the westy wood
panels (and on the deluxe trim strips and to hold the jailbars on),  not
slotted screws like the other years

(like really, who cares?)
