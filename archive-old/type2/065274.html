&gt;Driving back from a Schwartze-recommended FNVLAPS (NVL = not very 
&gt;local) I saw a HIGH TOP Vanagon with an &quot;Adventurewagon&quot; logo on its 
&gt;side, had never seen one of those, but the silver haired lady driving it 
&gt;seemed to be very happy, and I guess a cool ride could only help with 
&gt;that...

Isn't every volks drivers that makes cool rides???
