&gt;          If you can put accurate dimensions on a note to the list, I'll take
&gt; it to a local shop
&gt; that makes custom hosing (brake, fuel, hydraulic, etc.), for

    The inner diameter is 2 1/4 inches, and the hose is about four and a half to
five inches long.  It does have a slight bend to it, which would only be a
problem if you had a steel reinforced hose like I did.

    I don't know of metro molded rubber.  Do they have a website?

Thanks,
