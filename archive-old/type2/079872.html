Subject: Re: [T2] Can't figure it out!!!

all of you are right on with what my intial steps to clear the problem, but... i already bought and replaced the temp sensore when doing the tune up, with the new fuel filter. Now the gunk built up in the tank getting to the filter may be it, but would that be intermitent. I got in it today to go to work, starts ok, and drives fine all the way to work which I cruised on the interstate for a 5-6 miles and no sign of any probs.?
I know this is a long shot but this is something that came to mind today and may not even be close so set me straight if not...
What if the bus is running rich, for whatever reason, and give the right conditions enough unburned vapor builds in an exhaust that is at just the right temp to ignite. So here is where it starts to backfire, no power. Pull over let unburned vapors escape from exhaust and it runs just fine. That's what it acts like in theroy anyway. Doesn't happen all the time, that's why it is driving me nuts. Thanks for everyone's input, any other suggestions?
