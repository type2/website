Subject: [T2] curtain holders

Paul:
I'm an electrical contractor and I've solved that problem with insulated 
electrical wire, usually #12, and a screw at each end. I have it on my 
work truck (82 Vanagon, actually) in several pretty colors: red, blue,
white, black, green, purple, yellow. I usually strip the end where it
goes around the screw. I've made upper curtain rods as well, not as
sturdy as the factory aluminum kind, but start to finish about 2 minutes
each and about 3.5 cents a foot! This stuff also works really nice to 
do the fall ritual of wiring the heater boxes fully open on less than
optimum heater boxes/cables in the rust belt. And many other temporary
fixes much the same as baling wire was used by our rural population 40
years ago. Perhaps life is not so good now that we have those big round
bales?
