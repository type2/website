&gt; Does anyone know if the arch or profile of a the

Many years ago I was looking at what I might run into
if I made a pop-top maintaining the stock top profile.
I found different buses of the same model year with
different stampings in the roof.I found reinforcements
for small openings and for large openings. It appeared
that all had overall profile the same, but finding
them different on same year was perplexing.

I have heard that the Westphalia coach builders got a
special run that was specific to them. That would
account for the same year diffs, as one was a westie,
other was not.

By appearance, the overall was alike; the reinforcing
and where the hole was cut were not.
