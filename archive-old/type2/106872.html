Subject: Re: [T2] RE: T2 tune up question

&gt;Had that problem with my socket too...I grabbed my favorite stuff(3m
&gt;weatherstrip glue) and just glued it back in...I don't think it has ever
&gt;come back out with a spark plug again. 

Another method that has worked for me in the past if the rubber washer is damaged or missing - simply put a few short strips of masking tape over the edges of the socket.  Test fit a plug and keep adding tape until it is a snug fit.  I've never dropped a plug that way (but I keep the rare-earth-magnet-on-a-stick handy just in case).
