To everyone who expressed an interest in parts off the '71 van we have
(for running gear replacements).

I finally got a good look at the windows in the '72 camper (non-pop top)
and they are *not* louvered.  They are sliders with screens. Sorry if I
got anbody's hopes up.  

And I am truly sorry for having taken so long to get back to you all on
this. 

Lauria Watts.
