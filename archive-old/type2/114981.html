Good.

You don't need it. It's a bad afterthought design to meet changing
regulations of the day and you bus will lose some power (runs worse) and
there is a hesitation just off idle.

When you decide to become the PO it would be nice of you to give the next
owner a smog-able bus. I don't know how far away you are but more states are
going this route and someday CA won't be the only laughing stock of this
list.

If you have to replace the heater boxes you'll have a hard time finding a
75-78 setup (triangle flanges). Because of this and the muffler options for
the 72-74 setup that is still available and compatible with your bus, the
choice of 72-74 mufflers will probably lack the EGR port.

If you only need to get a new muffler, you could opt to get a 1-piece unit
that eliminates the cross over pipe that has an EGR port and block off the
port with a gasket and small piece of metal. The bus will run fine with it
blocked and your bus karma will increase ten-fold. ;-)

Do you still have the cross over pipe and is it in good condition?
