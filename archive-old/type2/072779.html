Subject: Parking Brake
Date: Thu, 25 Feb 1999 12:11:35 -0500 (EST)

List-
I have a 72 Westy that has a parking brake that just won't hold. I have
taken the rear hubs off and adjusted the shoes (star adjusters) and have
tightened up the cables in the front of the bus under the brake leaver. The
brake will hold for a few days then it begins to slip. Brake handle pulls
out about half way, cables seem to be free.
Is there a part of this brake system that wears or breaks that I'm missing?
I have compared it to my other 72, which works fine, and have found no
difference. What should I look for next?
Thanks,
