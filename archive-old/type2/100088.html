Subject: Water!

I put some of that NASA silver &quot;bubble wrap&quot; insulation you can get at Home
Depot underneath the front rubber mat in my 77 Riveria today.  When I pulled
off the fiberboard panels to tuck it under I found water in a trough that
runs across the front, behind that panels.  Shouldn't there be some drain
holes there to allow any water to drain, or do I have a more serious problem
and need to find where the water is getting in? I'm guessing that it's
coming in somewhere by the headlights.  It seems that the water gets in
after every hard rain, even if the van is just parked overnight.

Thanks!
