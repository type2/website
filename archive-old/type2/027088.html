X-Diagnostic: MESSAGE MAY NOT BE TOPICAL

On Jan 7, Dallas Chisholm inquired whether it was safe to drive temporarily 
with a knocking CV joint. I would not like to find out what happens if it 
lets go. On a road trip I had the similar dilemma: but with no spare CV or 
boot kit, and no jack stands I faced either a hefty shop charge or running 
the risk of finding out. I did discover a temporary &quot;fix&quot; that got me home, 
and which might get Dallas thru his final exams:
Block the opposite side front tire, jack up offending side rear wheel, put 
the transmission in neutral and the parking brake off (carefully to make 
sure van is stable on the jack (or use a jack stand if you are carrying 
one), then rotate the offending side rear wheel several turns in both 
directions. The maneuver just-described has the effect of redistributing the 
grease within the two cv joints, which temporarily stops the binding which 
causes the knocking. I could then drive several hundred more miles before it 
started up again, and thus arrived home.
At home I topped up the joints with grease and the noise has yet to return! 
Apparently the grease slowly and imperceptibly leaks out of the boot flange 
until it reaches the point of insufficiency.
