&gt;&gt; Ive heard around from firends that there is a stuff now , kind of glue,
that body shop use to put body panel.  they glue it instead of weld it!!
Sound like you avoid lot of problem no ?? Anyone can give me  a name or web
site on this, my friend say it sound like &quot;durocell&quot; or &quot;metacell&quot;  !! At
this point i bet you cant replace welding in such place as rocker, but sure
there is a way to GLUE some body panel as rear wheel arch, and then avoid
the metal under to heat and wave!! &lt;&lt;

Overlap joints might work ok, but I can't see how this will work for butt
joints.  I'd love to hear from the guinea pigs who try it out.
