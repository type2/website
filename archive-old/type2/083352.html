&gt; Question is, on a 1971 bus the 1600 size engine, how many shims is to many.

&gt; what do you think.

You need three shims, but the thickness of those shims is important.  I'd
suggest that you consult the Bentley manual and consider the problem
carefuly before proceeding.  End play is measured in thousandths of an
inch and if you get it wrong you are in a world of hurt.
