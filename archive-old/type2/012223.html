&gt;My question is; are there alternative campgrounds that are perhaps
&gt;smaller, unusual,
&gt;and cheaper through the US ? Where do bus folk go when traveling ? How
&gt;does one
&gt;find these places ?

     As others mentioned, state parks are usually good. Different costs 
in different states-stayed at sinks canyon state park in Wyoming in 96, 
cost about 4 bucks, and was one of the best sites we had on a 7 week run. 
Also, I've read many posters on this list have used BLM locations, 
apparently they are free(BLM being Bureau of Land Management, Federally 
owned lands; and I've never used them personally).

     If you end up out California way (which I know is not in your 
itinerary), try to hunt up a copy of California Camping by Tom Stienstra. 
Great book. I've got an older copy and it's chock full of some of the 
best campgrounds you've never heard of, only the locals know about 'em. 
Killer resource for the Golden State.
