Subject: 65 westy - the saga continues

this beast now has a working horn.  i had to use a screw terminal horn,  dont
tell the vintage perverts.    i like a 6V horn in a 12V bus, as its REALLY
LOUD

the brakes are bled and happy

the brakes lights, turn signals, etc work, with help from my electric guru,
who cannot fathom why i dont jive with wires.    (if you leave a light bulb
unscrewed from an overhead socket, won't  the electricity fall out?)    i
went though my entire collection of used brake senders (about 6) to find a
good one- not a one.   had to steal a new one of a new 67 master cylinder
that came out of a parts stash.

the headlights are disassembled all over the garage floor.  

i switched to a 009 distributor..  the carb clogged up.   i want to switch to
a 30 PICT 1.  also the battery is acting dead.   maybe the wires got mungled
up front.   

interestingly enough the front floor is over half covered with perfect white
paint.   it must have been in a nice climate for quite a while.  yes, it has
a hole on each side too.

no more mice.   i dont know if on theone hand, the kitty got tired of
bringing them to me, as i wasn't enthusiastic enough, or on the other hand,
if she stopped hunting, or if on the third hand, she killed them all off.
  maybe aliens abducted them and dropped them in Texas.
