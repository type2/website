&lt;&lt; Having concerns about draining my van battery while camping I was 
 thinking of buying an automotive battery, a good size one. Then use 
 12 volt florescent lamps  clipped to the terminals to light up the 
 interior and the camp. It would be good for powering my lap top 
 computer as well if I rig up a cigarette lighter receptacle. I could 
 then charge up the batter at home.

You could also get a battery isolator(for around 30 bucks, or you could 
construct one of your own), then you wouldn't have to worry about hooking a 
charger up to it at home. You could run all sorts of accessories off of it, 
and it would still get a charge from your Bus Gen/alt. Basically the battery 
would be isolated from being used by your bus.
