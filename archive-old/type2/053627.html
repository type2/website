Subject: Help!  Broken down with a fuel problem in Everett, WA

Is anybody awake yet?


Background:
Yesterday while driving on the freeway, around 65, my '72 began lurching.  
It was about 80 degrees outside.  The bus was driving fine when it suddenly 
lost power.  Both myself and my girlfriend lurched forward as the bus seemed 
to stop for a second.  This continued for about a mile before we made it to 
the side of the road.  Very noticeable and dramatic.  Pulled to the side, 
listened to the engine and went to look at it, it seemed to be running fine, 
if not a tiny bit or uneven.  Waited a few and got back on the road looking 
for an offramp.  It ran and jerked every now and then, still dramatic, till 
we got to an offramp and parked.  I didn't see any problems, the engine 
still sounded the same as on the freeway, but I noticed the fuel filter was 
just D I R T Y as hell.  We made it to our friends place, went and got a 
fuel liter and replaced it.  Lots of big black chunks in the filter along 
with the silt.  We went for a drive and it seemed to have fixed the problem.

Current Problem:
We hung out for a few hours and then were going to go home when I noticed a 
puddle behind the bus.  Under the engine compartment, on the right side 
facing toward the front of the bus is a metal pan/plate that seems to 
protect the underside of the motor.  It is to the right of the main case and 
'covered' the valve tubes.  Anyway, dirty gasoline was dripping off this 
plate.  I removed the plate and found the problem.  The fuel line goes from 
the tank, to the fuel filter(never seen anyone put it there before, right 
next to the starter) to a little metal something or other (I'm guessing it's 
the fuel pump, but I 'm just guessing).  This thingy has three lines 
connected to it.  The line coming from the fuel filter comes in at the top, 
next to another line that protrudes from the top and a stubby line at the 
bottom that runs into a hole on that metal pan thing and terminates without 
connecting.  It appears to me to be a drain/breather/something hose.  
However, it was out of this hose that fuel was dripping steadily.  I cleaned 
the area a little and had my girlfriend fire up the bus for a second and it 
spurted out this dirty gas.

We slept in the bus overnight after I pushed it forward to a clean spot of 
ground, to see how much it leaked over the night.  There's a gas spot about 
the size of a dinner plate on the ground under that hose.

Does anyone know what this thing is?  Could I cap that hose and make it home 
(20 miles)?  Help! :)
