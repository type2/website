This may seem a little obvious but, remember to slide the canoe in
carefully. I was taking a kayak to my cottage, and the person who pushed
it in from the back was to fast and we misjudged the length and now i
have a lovely crack in my windshield!!! 

I want to drive my bus, but i need a new battery ... any suggestions on
a cheap battery?

Later . . .
