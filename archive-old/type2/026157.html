Subject: Heater flapper boxes - seals?

All,

I noticed when I fitted my new heater flapper boxes (a year ago) that there
was no seal of any description on the flaps or openings inside.  This didn't
seem right to me - even with the heater fully on there is just metal to
metal contact and a small gap for air to leak out.  Should there be some
sort of rubber or foam in there?  I'm sure my heater would work much better
if there was.  Matthew Bulley wrote recently about the importance of making
sure the heater cables are pulling the flaps all the way open, and I know
mine are.  There are no appreciable gaps in my ductwork and I don't have a
problem with the temperature of the air coming out of the front outlets,
just the volume.
