Subject: Re: [T2] High amp alternator

 &gt; Has anyone out there installed a 90 amp golf
 &gt; alternator in a bus, or is is
 &gt; just not doable?

A guy on www.shoptalkforums_dot_com put a non-stock alternator into a 
TypeIV engine in a Beetle. It is in the stock location. He has 
reported that it has been going well. From what I recall he had to 
use a particular model distributor because of the direction of 
airflow (?). Anyway, do a search there for the details.

On the other hand I have been able to increase the output of the 
stock alternator by replacing the bearings, lightly sanding the slip 
rings and cleaning the gunk off the rear connections! It's certainly 
the cheapest option. Another good related trick was to clean the 
corrosion off the rat's nest of connections on the +ve post of the 
solenoid. This gained me something like 0.5 - 1.0 v measured at the 
dash! It really needs one of those rubber boots to keep the gunk off.

Cheers,

Martin.
