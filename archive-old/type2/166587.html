Subject: Re: [T2] E-Brake vs. Foot brake

That is how I determine when the rear brakes need
adjusting. When the parking brake needs an extra tug
to hold, the rear brakes are out of adjustment. I
usually need to tighten them in the fall and in the
spring. The brakes still work quite well because you
have front disks and they handle most of the braking
anyway. In a panic stop however, you wouldn't.

BTW, re/gas line - Be sure the fuel line you install
is for multi point fuel injection - the high pressure
stuff. Your pump is capable of well in excess of 100
psi. A spray like that with a bad plug wire and
hopefully you get your boy out in time - maybe not.
What is lucky is that the hose broke instead of just a
small crack. The volume of liquid would take far more
ignition source than a wayward sparkplug wire. A fine
mist and you may have had only a few seconds to get
out. Forward motion would feed the fire forward. -BaH


That is how I always set the parking brake. Really
 does nothing more. Me
 thinks that the parking brake just needs some love
 to work better... I will
 have to get under there and adjust those drums and
 see how much it helps.
