Subject: I've Got Bad Gas!

Well OK, so it's really not me.  In fact, it's not even a bus.  It's my 76
914 that sat for a year and now the gas stinks.  

It only had about a quarter gallon of gas (or less) in it so can I just put
in a couple of gallons of fresh gas to dilute the stuff and run it till it
clears out?  What effect will this likely have on my fuel injectors and fuel
filter?  Bear in mind that this is a type IV FI motor so works pretty much
the same as a fuel injected bus.

Thanks!

Bus-less, but with a pair of 914s on hand :)
