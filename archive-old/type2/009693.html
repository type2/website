&gt;Also can some one tell me what color
&gt;fuses i should have from left to right in the 10 fuse fuse block in my
&gt;68 bus?  All of my fuses look old so i wanted to replace them with right
&gt;color / size.

According to the Bentley on the wiring diagram page: from August 1967 (68 
and 69 models)
it says= all fuses: 8 amps [that would be white]
