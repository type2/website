&gt; What? As opposed to the some of the &quot;openminded&quot; Americans on this list like
&gt; yourself?
&gt;
&gt; Get over yourself, and kill this thread.

OK folks, basic human nature lesson here.  An inflammatory statement
followed by a command to be silent does not produce the desired result
unless you are carrying a large weapon.

This message had no bus content and therefore does not comply with the
list charter any more than the message that prompted it.

The best response to inflammatory statements is no response at all.  It's
very difficult to create a flamewar if nobody will play with you.

This thread and all its subthreads are officially killed.

Most of you know that I'm a teacher.  The school year just started and I
have little patience left.  Don't test it.

George Lyle, List Admin.
