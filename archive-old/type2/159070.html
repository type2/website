Considering what today's prices must have gotten to it seems like it
would be worth a plane ticket and gas money to fly out and drive back on
a weekend rather than pay someone else.

2000 miles at 20 mpg = 100 gallons = $300 + $150 (for plane fare) = $450
plus your time, of course....I guess it's like most things and depends
on how bad you want it.
