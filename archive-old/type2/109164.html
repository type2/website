From: &quot;Theodore Reshetiloff&quot; &lt;TReshetiloff_at_cambridgeassociates_dot_com&gt;
&gt; Thank god for my bilgeblower install...

I'm planning on installing the bilge blower in the spare tire well in my
bay, routing the outlet through to the engine compartment and attaching the
outlet duct to the existing (and currently defunct) aux fan housing after
removing the aux fan's guts.  Hopefully that will keep the original heating
system's functions intact.

The outlet will also have a small duct that blows directly onto the rear
window.  Granted, the air won't be heated until the interior of the bus
heats up, but I'm hoping that the moving air will help to keep the rear
window fog-free.  We don't get much ice down here in Georgia.
