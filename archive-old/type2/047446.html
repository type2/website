&gt; &gt;  My feeling is the Internet is helping to push prices up. You can still
get
&gt; one for a decent price, but not from someone on the net!

&gt; I'll take a chance and answer this on the &quot;list&quot; because I believe it has
&gt; Type II content.
&gt; A few weeks ago I posted on this list that there was a nice rust free low
&gt; mileage &quot;78 Dormobile in Santa Clara CA that someone could get for
$1000.00
&gt; or less, and I'd help in any way I could with the purchase.  I got a
couple
&gt; of bites, but no takers.  There are lots of &quot;bargains&quot; on the net if you
look
&gt; and act.
