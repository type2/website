&gt;i have heard that the oil plate on the bottom of a porsche 914 engine will
&gt;fit the later model air cooled bus engines (you know, that plate on the
&gt;bottom with the little bump and 2 bolts), that the 914 engines came with oil
&gt;temp senders factory installed, and that the sender hole is the same size as
&gt;the vdo sender for their oil temp gauge (9/16&quot; dia).

The plates are interchangeable, but you will have to cut the bottom 1/2&quot;
off of your dipstick in order to use the Porsche plate with the VDO sender.
I have had one on my bus for a few years now, and despite what some may
tell you I get useful data from it.
