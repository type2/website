Subject: Definition of a VW Cultist

I wrote this for a post on the Samba but since I'm so good at cracking
myself up I figured I'd expand the pool of people who may also find it
humorous. (My goal is 2.)

Definition of a cult, as applies to Bus ownership:

A cultist is one who has a strong belief in the Bentley Manual and John
Muir; who frequently attends Fix-It parties and Bus campouts; who has a high
level of financial giving to an air cooled cause; who schools their children
in the proper use of a wrench; who has accumulated survival foods and has a
strong belief in the ability to fix anything wrong with his/her Bus on the
side of the road; and who distrusts newer water cooled vehicles. Any of
these may qualify (a person as a VW Bus cultist) but certainly more than one
would cause us to strongly look at this person as a threat to modern
automakers, and his family as being in a risk situation that qualified for
rides in &quot;normal&quot; vehicles provided by family and friends when &quot;The Bus&quot; is
again broken down.
