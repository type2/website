Subject: RE: [T2] Re: burned...

&gt;Then there was my buddy working as a military cop out in Omaha doing civil
&gt;patrol and he found a ton of weed stashed in a car door during a stop.
&gt;Something like $10K worth! Ya never know what you may find in a used car
&gt;haha

In all my years of working on 20's, 30's and 40's cars I kept hoping I'd 
find some ex-gangster's car with a few hundred thousand stuffed under the 
rear seat or something...

I have found some money though - so far I'm up to 73 cents.... &lt;grin&gt;
