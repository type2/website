&gt; &gt; You need to have it turned ON THE HUB!
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; I've heard this before. Why does it have to be on
&gt; the hub?
&gt; 
Because the alignment needs to be precisely the same
as when it is on the hub. Lets say they get &quot;perfect&quot;
alignment of the rotor alone while in the lathe. Put
that rotor on your hub and it's not &quot;perfect&quot; anymore.
It now turns on the axis of the hub which may or may
not be the same &quot;perfect&quot; as the rotor alone in the
lathe.

Thus it is very important to be certain the bearing
seats are clean and the bearings seated squarely in
the bore. A bearing not totally seated will cause an
uneven turning on the lathe and will possibly seat
some miles 'down the road' - may be one, may be 10,000
- and suddenly the rotor is wobbling!

I just went through this with a brand new rotor. It
was waaaayyyy off! Brought it back with the hub and
they did it again - &quot;near perfect!&quot; They wanted to
just use the retainer screws but I insisted on using
lug nuts as well.

Our stuff is way overbuilt by todays standards, but on
a modern vehicle, if your lug nuts are not torqued to
spec, your brakes may squeek or grab!

Short answer = It's not a perfect world!
