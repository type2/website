Subject: Rapid Clutch Failure 1978 1970CC Type 2 
Message-ID: &lt;7js18g$jkip_at_eGroups_dot_com&gt;

Just bought a 1978 Type 2 Camper Van - Viking Conversion - chose it because of the layout and the heating system worked, but ignored the fact it was heavy to get in and out of gears.

Got worse and limped into a local garage where they pulled the clutch out and down to bare metal. They put in a new clutch and got going again - witin a few miles (about 20) it was back difficult to change gear again.

Limped home and got the engine dropped - the new clutch has gone in a matter of a few miles - the metal backing is blue and the clutch material is worn and broken up on one side.

Thoughts

1) The guy I bought it off put in the wrong clutch type, realised it was a problem and sold it on to me quick. The first garage just changed the worn clutch for one exactly the same type, and it went straight away again.

2) The first garage put the wrong one in by mistake

3) There is a nack to setting up the clutch - if you dont get it right it 
wears within a few miles

4) I'm just unlucky

Any ideas as to which is most likely - can you mix up the clutch types and get one that nearly works, but doesnt last. Is there anything that could mess up a clutch so soon.

Is there any way of checking which clutch type fits which engine ?
