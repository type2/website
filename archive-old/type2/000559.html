Am cleaning out my mess of a garage and have the following items I no longer
need.

1. Owners manuals for '75, '77, '78, and '77 westy manual.
2. New heat exchangers for '75 1.8 motor.(Thanks Mr. LaCoz)
3. Rebuilt stock vacuum distributor for '75 bus. Rebuilt by Will Wood-
anyone heard from him lately.
4. Complete Hazet tool kit in original round box.
5. Middle seat for '71 bus.
6. Three gauge AutoMeter panel- temp,pressure,volts, with senders.
7. Westy propane tank (needs regulator) that fits under the sliding door.
(HEAVY)
8. Vinyl material that closely matches the original '71 Westy gold stuff-
enough to do two buses. The stuff Blake Sartin was selling a while back.
If anyone is interested let me know with a reasonable offer, plus shipping.

Don't take life too seriously--you'll never live through it.
