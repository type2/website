Subject: ACSR candidate in Northern VA

There is and has been for a couple of months an interesting splittie
camper at my 3rd favorite parts supplier.  Not being knowledgeable about
splits, and having, as I do, a surfeit of busses, I would like to make
this bus a candidate for any ACSR folk who are interested.  The bus is in
(for a dead splittie) great shape.  No structural rust, new nose skin and
rockers, no major rust in the doglegs, small (1.5&quot;) rustthrough behind
cargo doors.  The rust problem it does have is of the &quot;Flash&quot; variety. 
This is an abandoned project and was sanded all over and left, so it will
need a thorough going over with a sandblaster and immediate priming. 

It is a non-westy camper.  There are two plates under the passenger, one
from the CA Dept of housing (?????) with no readable info and a second
from &quot;EZ Camper of America&quot;.  The second plate has a stamp in the year
space that reads 196_ so this is no barn door.  The M-code plate reads as
follows:

15N

426 030 139

UA 2112 383883 7058158

The camper interior is all there, but thrashed, as the windows, while
there, are stacked inside (ie. the plywood is badly delaminated), but as
models all the bits are present.  It is laid out in a manner quite similar
to my '73 with a sink cabinet behind the passenger seat, a jump seat
behind the driver's seat, suicide locker on the passenger side and what
looks like a bed-seat.

If someone could post the decode on the M-code plate, I would appreciate
it. If anyone is interested, let me know and I will pass on directions. I
would love to take this on, but I already have twice my allowable limit on
busses.  I figure that some offer in the $100-$500 range would take it,
but I have not discussed price, only inquired if it was for sale.  It is
not in immediate danger of the crusher, but it is exposed, it is
deteriorating and I would feel very bad if it sat until it was past
saving.
