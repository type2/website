Subject: Re: [T2] At least buses don't face these crosswinds

&gt;  The green car is a french Citroen 2CV.

&gt;  Very fun little car to bomb around in.
	I hitch-hiked in one in France too in the late 50's. Lovely 
fun ride. The brakes went as we were trying to stop at a railway 
crossing - just a small wooden gate. The driver yelled &quot;Les Fracas&quot;, 
and her meaning took a few seconds to register  by which time she had 
turned and stopped in a hedge! Yes, it is a very fun car, very quick 
to respond :-)  I still love that canvas rollback roof.

&gt;Now collision safety is another topic... &lt;grin!&gt;

Different sense of security now, both theft and road safety. What a 
bore  life is becoming.

&gt;Very fun little car to bomb around in. Would LOVE to have one...

I used to yearn for a Vespa too and a tiny MGB. Now I want a 
cabriolet ('93-94 if anyone has one- white of course)  and I did have 
one of the first Fiat 850's over here. The first few had sloping 
headlights - like a baby Jag.
Funny how young people now seem to want HUMMERS!
