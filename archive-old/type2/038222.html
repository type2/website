Subject: Compression Test

I've searched to library and can not find step by step compression test 
directions.  Could someone point me there or email me some directions.  The 
carb adjustment for 34pict3 directions are very well written.  Thanks to who 
ever submitted those.

PS!  I'm looking for a jumpseat and tent for 71 bus.  Please email me if you 
can help.

Nothin left to do but smile, smile, smile!!
