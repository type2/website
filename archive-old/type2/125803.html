Subject: RE: [T2] '78 Westy firewall removal?

Alright!  I got those screws out and was able to persuade the firewall
out with some assertive tugging.  ;)  Found the source of my gas smell
wasn't the filler elbow, which is still in fine supple shape, but the
remaining overflow vapor system hoses.  The 2 on the tank were still in
place, but the ones at the other end of the yellow tubing had come off,
so I replaced all 4 with some good silicone hose.  Now all the vapor
system hoses have been replaced, but I have it plugged off at the &quot;T&quot; by
the engine door since my charcoal canister seems to have run away from
home.

The hardest part was getting the firewall back IN, not because of the
engine, but because of the tin and foam insulation.  I ended up bending
the tin down, getting the firewall in place, then fitting the foam to
the tin and firewall and bending it back in place.

In the end, I think I finally have a physically fit (though not
&quot;complete&quot; when it comes to emissions ;) Westy that's ready for some
summer use with the family.  Didn't really want to be driving it around
much, especially with family, until I got the vapor smell figured out
and fixed.

Eventually I'll tackle the fuel gauge, it likes to work its way down to
empty quite fast once the tank reaches about 3/4 of a tank or a little
less.

Once again, thanks for the help!  Hopefully I'll know enough from
experience to be able to contribute some back.  ;)
