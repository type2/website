Subject: RE: Carpeted pedastals

Another option is to make it snap down, which is great for keeping =
things in place but still having them be removable.  If want to get =
really fancy you have the pieces edge bound (any carpet store should be =
able to do this, especially a remenant shop) you can insert coat hanger =
or thin brass rod into the binding to make sure the carpet doesn't sag =
where there aren't snaps.=20

In my SAAB there were special carpet snaps.  On the body you'd use the =
standard screw in male snap, the carpet snaps have a metal ring that =
inserts through the top and has small metal teeth that get bent over =
through the female portion of the snap on the underside of the carpet.  =
The advantage of these is that they are significantly more inconspicuous =
than shiny snap heads.
