&gt;&gt;Being totally new to the type one motor, I don't know what is normal.  When I

to which Mike of Armenian descent responded:
&gt;
&gt;I could be wrong but isn't blue smoke oil and white smoke coolant? 
&gt;So, you might have some initial oil burn and then obviously, there's 
&gt;no coolant, so it is probably just condensation that is left in the 
&gt;exhaust system...

	Right on Mike.
	A brief burst of blue smoke upon startup is usually nothing 
to worry about.  Motors with 'racing' clearances often do this; it 
implies upper-cylinder lubricant from the cold start, which is good 
(so long as it isn't so 'generous' as to foul the plugs).  My Renault 
10 would always do this when in top condition (80 mph top speed; 53 
mpg _at_ 55 mph).
	White fog from water-vapour condensing is even less to worry about.
	Get to grips with the substances themselves, Nat.  Hold your 
hand near the tailpipe while this matter is being emitted, and then 
examine the hand for evidence of oil vs. water.
