Subject: Send me your favorite routes

Volks -
  I'm trying to set up a specialized mapping service for our busses.
Generally speaking, hills are bad, and most of us here prefer the
scenic route anyways.  So if you have a favorite route you'd like to
share with the rest of us Busheads, please send them my way.  More
details are better of course, but anything you can give me would be
appreciated, even if it's just &quot;Start at point X, take route 123 and
wind up at point Y&quot;

I suppose its possible this already exists somewhere..if so, could you
point me in that direction?

Let me know if you have any questions.
Oh, and please email me privately so we don't overwhelm the list
Thanks much!
