Subject: Re: [T2] Drive Your VW to Work Day

&gt; &gt; Everyday for me too, everyday is a good day for me to drive my bus to
&gt; &gt; work or anywhere else. I don't have a choice, it takes me by gun point
&gt; &gt; and swears that as long as I cooperate, no one will get hurt.
&gt; &gt;
&gt;   Your bus...The previous owner wasn't Ann Coulter, was it... ?-(
&gt;
&gt;

No, but the previous owner did have his way with a sawsall, so I have
to be VERY careful when I pull out a powertool. . .

It's soooooo cool to be driving her around everyday now, after three
years of parts gathering and slowly putting her back together. still
have a long way to go until shes &quot;all there&quot; but at least were past
the surgeries and moving on to recovery.
