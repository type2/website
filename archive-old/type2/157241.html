Subject: Re: [T2] Timing gun issues...

&gt; Are buses 12v or 6v?  If it's 6v it's gonna get sort of complicated.
&gt;
&gt;what year is your bus?

It 's a 78.  I'm pretty sure it's 12v.

&gt;Guys,

&gt;
&gt;That section of the instructions are for POSITIVE GROUND 12 V systems.  
&gt;Look further and you should find the correct connections for a negative 
&gt;ground sysytem.


It only has instructions for a positively ground 12v or a 6v.


&gt;You should get the CP2527 or the CP7504 or the CP7515
&gt;inductive lights. Pos, neg, and clamp on the plug
&gt;wire.

Thanks for the tip, I'll look into it.  I was wondering why it was so cheap.
