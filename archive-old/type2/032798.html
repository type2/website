Dave,

To determine whether the gauge or the sender is faulty, disconnect the
sender and connect various resistors instead:

10 Ohm should give you a full reading
22 Ohm should give you a 1/2 full reading
47 Ohm should give you an empty reading

If you get those readings, then the gauge is fine and the sender is not.
Also look at the procedure i had scanned at

&gt; My fuel gauge works sort of. Full is full, But empty is at half. It only
&gt; uses top half of gauge. My question is does this mean the sender is the
&gt; problem or the gauge?
