Subject: Re: [T2] Parcel Tray

&amp;gt; Bus Depot has a parcel tray - it goes under the dash:
&amp;gt;
&amp;gt; http://www.busdepot_dot_com/details.jsp?partnumber=78990

I think that thing is horribly ugly.

Bus Boys has some very mesh style repro trays.
they are a lot more expensive though, and maybe not quite as functional.
