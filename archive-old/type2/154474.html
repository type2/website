one more thing...
should the clicking of the electronic fuel pump go loud at times and then the clicking settle down at times...
what i mean by this is ...
sometimes it sounds like it has ran out of fuel and is empty loud clicking and then it sounds suttle with the
clicking like its full again....? hmmmm again i say..?

Where do you have that fuel pump mounted?

Under the tank in the frame rail?

Or up in the engine compartment?

Electric pumps are pushers, not pullers. By that I mean they need to be gravity fed. They do not like to have
to suck fuel from the tank. Mechanical fuel pumps are pullers.

When an electric fuel pump is mounted up in the engine compartment, it pulls when new but as it gets older it
has a tough time pulling.
