You can get a generic lighter assembly, or just an &quot;accessory socket&quot;, at
any FLAPS, Radio Shack, etc.  they only cost a few dollars.  If you don't
want to punch a hole in the dash you can use a bracket to mount it under the
dash in a convenient but relatively unobtrusive location.

If what you really want/need is a &quot;power outlet&quot;, check a marine store.
They have them with primarily plastic construction, so corrosion isn't a
problem in less than ideal installations.  Also available there in stainless
steel, but a bit more expensive.

A nifty variation on this theme is a &quot;Chart-Lighter&quot; [from a marine supply
store].  Instead of a lighter insert these have an insert with a small
hooded light that shines at 90* to the axis of the assembly.  When you need
a 12V outlet you just pop out the light assembly and plug in your power
cord.  These have in the past been available in mostly plastic or in
stainless steel, but I haven't bought one for ~5 years so that may no longer
be true.

&gt;&gt;  Does anyone know where to get an OEM or repro lighter/lighter socket
assembly?  Not that I plan to take up smoking, but it would be nice to have
the lighter socket as a power point.  &lt;&lt;
