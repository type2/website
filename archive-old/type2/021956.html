Hi Volks,

Having thought about and discussed this idea of Barry's about coping 
with too-low garage doors:
&gt; Let me see.  Combining your top two ideas, if you remove the 'junk'
&gt; rubber from the wheels by pulling each side OVER the rim (so that the
&gt; rubber tire sort of flops around OUTSIDE of the rims), you could scootch
&gt; the 'bus' into the garage without damage to the floor.

I found it would not work: the inner sidewall would interfere with 
suspension parts, brake lines etc., probably resulting in damage to 
at least the latter -- sorry :-)
 
&gt; On bare rims, you coud use pieces of plywood, two per wheel, and keep
&gt; switching the plywood as you drive into the garage.  Remember, this is
&gt; only going to be done once in/once out per year, and it might be fun!!

But why not, said my pal, attach the wood to the rims?  Cut some 
pieces of 2x4 to a length slightly more than the inner width of the 
rims, give them slanted ends, and hammer them between the rims' 
&quot;sidewalls&quot;.  Repeat until it looks like enough of them.  Maybe grind 
a &quot;channel&quot; into the outer circumfence of this &quot;wooden wheel&quot; and 
fasten the pieces of wood with a string of wire.  Mount on bus.  
Drive into garage.

Don't give praise to me -- but I'll forward it to its proper 
addressee if I get some anyway.  Check it out, and let me know.  And 
if it works, maybe we ought to forward the idea to the vintage bus 
list?

Yours,
    Erik.
