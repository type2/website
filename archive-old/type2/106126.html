Subject: Re: [T2] Silver socket wattage

&gt; What is this silver socket?

I have only seen it come on late bay Westies, around 76 to 79. It was mounted in the dash below the glove box.
The hole is about the size of a guitar amp connecter. On page 24 here:
http://www.type2_dot_com/bartnik/csmanual.htm
You can just see it in the right picture.

And Richard, go to page 9. It shows the circuit breaker area on USA Westies. We never had a 12v outlet there.
Sounds like something that was added. [I put a cigar lighter socket in my fridge panel on my 77 Westy, it is
direct to the aux battery.]
