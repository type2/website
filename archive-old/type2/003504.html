Hi Aaron and list,

I can read german and the text entstörsatz means radio noise filter or
screen
Zum störer means to the noise emitter
0.47µf/100v means  0.47 microfarad per 100 volts.

Now I am not into these electrical things, so maybe someone else can take
this thread over from me and explain what it does exactly.

I am only the translator.......

&gt; Hey Everyone,
&gt;     I found these parts on my stash the other day.  They were in a NOS box
with the part number 211 035 657 A  and the word &quot;ENTSTORSATZ&quot;.

Here's a little description:
&gt;
&gt; 1st part
&gt;  about 1.5 in X 1.5in X .5 in box with a green wire and a red wire coming
out of it also has the words &quot;zum Storer&quot; printed on the side.
&gt;
&gt; 2nd part
&gt; smaller box with just one single black wire. Has &quot;0,47uF/100V&quot; printed on
it.
&gt;
&gt; Anyone have an idea as to what these things are?  I figured they might be
for a type 1 or 3 VW's from the part number?  I can send a picture to you
(not the list) if you need it.
&gt;
&gt; Thanks a lot,
&gt; Aaron Badertscher
