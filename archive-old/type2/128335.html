&gt; Anyone with a 78 willing to take a picture of the bottom of their seat &amp;
&gt; tracks so I can compare to my 76?

I can compare my 78 to my 76 tomorrow or saturday. I don't know where it
falls in production, but have a note with Richard's VIN estimate. If
there is a difference, I will attempt to photograph it.
