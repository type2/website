ben-your trans needs rebuilding 8^).
seriously, every time you grind the gears, you know metal is
coming off those synchros, so little by little they are becoming worn
and eventually will need to be replaced. forcing the gearshift  does not
improve the odds. there is no particular advantage in shifting into first while
rolling, and i never do. we have all seen what a non-vw driver does with the
shifter, trying to power-shift chevy-style. it is not a fun thing to watch...
if your knuckles are hitting the dash when you shift, the pattern needs
an adjustment at the base plate. you should be able to feel that &quot;detent&quot;
in both first and second. try this trick to get a few more miles out of yours-
at a stop, shift from neutral into second gear to slow the reciprocating parts,
then gently into first , and it should go in without forcing or searching.
the 72 bus has a different bushing pattern at the forward end of the shift rod
under the floor. it is a pin and probably the bushing is long gone. look there
and see all the slop that can cause. the pin may even be bent. you can do a lot
to improve the pattern there.
