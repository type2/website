Subject: Re: Possible Splittie purchase..have ?s 4 u

&gt;how much do seats cost? windows? assuming the engine does not run, 
&gt;how much to rebuild if it needs it and how much should i offer? 
&gt;the body looks good for an almost 30 year old van.
&gt;
&gt;i'd like to say this van would be for me, but it's going to my 
&gt;fiancee if i buy it and get it running. instead of an expensive 
&gt;engagement ring, i asked if she would like a bus...and she said 
&gt;YES! a splittie no doubt!
&gt;
&gt;thanks,

Wow, you have an incredible cool fiancee!  I mean, I love my wife, 
but if I had even suggested getting her a bus instead of an 
engagement ring, she wouldn't be my wife now!

Anyway, I 'm not an expert on splitties (by a long shot), but from 
experience with the '63 that I bought (which was in a field in 
Arizona) and recently put back on the road, I can give you this...

1) Front windshield - not too hard to find cheap, used, if you 
don't mind a little yellowing around the edge.  I could probably 
find you a used one pretty cheap if you can't find one locally.  
(Then again, it's ony a flat piece of glass - how much could it 
possibly cost new at a glass place?)  
(Actually, I would have had a windshield for you if those thieves 
hadn't stolen all the parts off my '63 parts buses last month!!!)

2) Seats - is it a walkthrough (2 single seats) or not (one bench 
seat if pre-63, or a 2/3 - 1/3 bench seat if post 63)?  New seats 
are probably pricey.  I know someone who has some old 
non-walkthrough seats which need complete reupholstering if that 
would help.  

3) Engine - if you don't absolutely insist on going original, I 
would recommend a 1600 dual-port motor - a LOT more power (and more 
reliable) than what might have come with it.  My 1600 d/p in my '63 
(admitedly not a heavier Westy) pulls hills almost as well as the 2 
liter did in my '77 Westy.  You can find a good used 1600 dual-port 
motor from a Bug for maybe $200-$250, and it is a direct drop-in 
into an old bus. (You may also want to upgrade to 12 volt electric, 
unless this is a '67 or someone already did it.  If there is still 
a battery in it, is it a 6v or 12v battery?)  If you go that way, 
you should also use the larger clutch.  A local shop had to perform 
some sort of modification for me to put a bigger clutch in my '63 
when I put in the 1600 d/p (grind out the trans bellhousing, I 
think).  They charged me about $50 to do this, and they strongly 
recommended it because the additional torque of the 1600 d/p could 
toast the smaller clutch pretty quickly.  Once this is done, you'll 
pretty much be able to use any engine/clutch parts from a post-67 
bus or a beetle, which means they'll be pretty cheap.

4) Other stuff - front end parts wear out.  If there is a lot of 
play in the front end you may need a link pin repair kit (about 
$40) and a days work - or worse, if you need a steering box, etc.  
Also, triple check the rust.  Jackpoints, floors (particularly near 
the side cargo doors and in front of the front seats, etc.).  Also, 
the gas tank may need repair if gas has been sitting in it for a 
long time. Is the transaxle any good?  Once I finally got my '63 
back on the road, I discovered that I needed a bungee cord on the 
shifter to keep it from popping out of 4th. No way to know this 
until I got it running.  Also window seals, door seals, electrical 
stuff, etc. etc. etc.  Plan on spending $1000-$2000 or more on this 
bus, particularly if you can't do it all yourself.  That being the 
case, you should buy it cheap.  Maybe $500 if it's pretty solid.  
If it has a lot of rust (and look carefully), walk away from it 
unless you have a lot of $$ to invest.  Generally, it is cheaper to 
buy a nice bus from someone who already did the restoration and 
then lost interest or ran out of money, than it is to buy a project 
bus and do it yourself (although it can be a labor of love!).

Anyway - good luck, and let us know what you decide to do!
