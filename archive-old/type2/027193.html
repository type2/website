George,
   I have a semicamper 74. I have a deep cycle marine battery that
I use to run a light and a T.V. and I am looking at a D.C. coffee maker.
I have to have coffee in the morning&lt;grin&gt;. I went out and bought a
cig lighter plug in/socket (whatever it is called). I mounted this inside
the cabinet that I built in behind the driver's seat. My little T.V. is
mounted on the top of this cabinet. Sooo, I have the socket wired direct
to the battery along with the light. These batteries come in different
physical
sizes so figure out where you are going to mount it then buy accordingly.
I have run these two items for weekends with no problem.
  I plan on wireing into a distribution box and adding a couple more sockets
with appropriate fuses,,etc. BTW, my battery is pretty good sized and will
run a small electric outboard motor all day.
   more details? mail me direct


I have a 73 Westy and after reading about the newer Westy's with
electricity available while they are parked. I'm wondering how I would
be able  to watch TV or heat up water for coffee, while either running
the engine or stopped.  I have a feeling this maybe very simple, but I
can't work it out. I have no cigarette lighter or power source like
that.

     Peace,
                    Daniel Axel Simmons

When people speak to you about a preventive war, you tell them to go and
fight it. 
After my experience, I have come to hate war.
