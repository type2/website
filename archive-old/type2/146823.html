Subject: Lead Paint Test results - 71 bus

I got a lead paint test kit from Ace hardware and attempted to test the 
paint on my 71 bus.  The paint looks to be original with a white top and 
read bottom.  The white tested clean.  The problem I ran into with the 
red is that the test I used has red/pink as the indicator and the red 
paint rubbed off onto the test kit so there is no way to get a good read 
with that test kit.  Good to know that 71 white is lead free.  I will 
follow up when/if I get the red tested in another fashion.

Sean
