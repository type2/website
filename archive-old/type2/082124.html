Subject: Re: [T2] head temperature sensor

Hmmm... The VERY FIRST thing I would do is take off the ground strap from
the battery and clean the bejezus off the body where the ground strap
attaches. And then clean the bejezus off the ground strap. Make them so
shiny you can see your reflection! And then do the same to the negative post
on the battery and the cable. I learned this on my Porsche 911 - which uses
a similar ground strap. Everything grounds through the body but if there is
any flux in the ground strap the entire car starts to get floating voltage
and weird stuff entails. In a carbeurated engine with a mechanical (or no)
choke and a mechanical fuel pump it will screw with the ignition a little -
but the higher amperage of the ignition will usually close any floating in
the ground - just for the spark. But fuel injection - and maybe the fuel
pump - will act whacky without VERY SOLID ground. On the Porsche, the O2
sensor would start sending bad data to the computer and the fuel mixture
will start getting whacky and then the injectors would start mis-firing and
before you knew it you were being passed by VW busses on the interstate.

Unless someone installed some kind of crazy fuel or ignition interrupt based
on the output of your temp sensor (a very dangerous idea), your engine
should run fine without the sensor connected. It kind of sounds like when
you had the sensor connected with the ohmmeter to the ground on the battery
you were giving a better ground connect through the ohmmeter than the engine
was getting through the ground strap - but that's just my guess...

&gt; I hate these kind of problems,  I would bet that this has nothing to do
&gt; with the head sensor but a broken/loose wire somewhere.  I would get it
&gt; running any way you can and then move wires around wiggling things see
&gt; if something causes problems.
&gt;  remember I was having all sorts of problems with mine cutting out,
&gt; checked everything, seems it was a bad connector on the wire to the
&gt; coil...

&gt;&gt; I tested my temperature head sensor today. I first disconnected the
&gt;&gt; sensor  wire but left the sensor installed. To take the measurements I
&gt;&gt; simply  connected my positive lead to the sensor wire and the negative
&gt;&gt; lead to the  ground terminal of my battery. Is this right? I took a
&gt;&gt; resistance reading  when the sensor was cold and found 10k ohms. I
&gt;&gt; then started the bus with the  meter connected and watched the
&gt;&gt; reading. The resistance dropped to 500 ohms  after about 5 minutes of
&gt;&gt; running. It seemed to stabalise around this point.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; I reconnected the sensor wire and started the bus. It ran for less
&gt;&gt; than a  minute and shut down. The same occurs when I restart.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; I believe that the sensor is deffective but I am trying to make sense
&gt;&gt; of  this situation.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Why does the bus run when the sensor is disconnected? Shouldn't it be
&gt;&gt; seeing  an open circuit at the sensor input?
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; In one case when I disconnected the sensor wire the bus would not
&gt;&gt; start at  all. I reconnected and it started and died. I then
&gt;&gt; disconnected the sensor  wire and it started and remained running.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Am I missing something here?
