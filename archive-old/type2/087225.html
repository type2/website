Subject: Re: [T2] The True path to enlightenment

Mike,

Last time I had a situation like this(type 1) bus engine...it turned out 
that I had a loose flywheel.....I had 40hp over stock and onyl 4 
dowells...it was my 2nd ever rebuilt engine.


My first one managed to break the crankshaft in half in the middle of the 
worst blizzard pennsylvania had seen in years.....I thought I was just 
passing thru...

Cheers, dave

&gt; You know that you have reached a new plane of conciousness when your
&gt; painstakingly rebuilt,
&gt;  spanking new,  shiny 2 liter longblock  that you only installed 2 weeks
&gt; ago begins ticking,
&gt;  quietly at first,
&gt; then it gradually gets louder and louder until it  sounds like the Hammers
&gt; of Hell beating the very life
&gt; out of the engine.
&gt; The engine that has become like your baby over the weeks that it took you
&gt; to transform it
&gt; from it's dirty, neglected beat down condition back to a like new
&gt; condition.
&gt;  The Hammers finally getting so loud inside your baby that you run to kill
&gt; the ignition
&gt;  before something comes flying through the case and really puts an end to
&gt; it.
&gt; 
&gt; You know that you have reached this state when this happens
&gt; and you don't
&gt; yell,
&gt; scream,
&gt; kick the dog,
&gt; or yourself.
&gt; You know when you have reached VW Zen when you just quietly pack up
&gt; your toolbox, lock up your bus for the night, and go to bed.
&gt; Tomorrow is another day...
&gt; 
&gt; That said,
&gt; Does anyone know of a reputable and experienced aircooled VW mechanic in
&gt; the New York
&gt; City area?
&gt; 
&gt; Time is not on my side on this one so I think I'm going to have to seek
&gt; professional help (No pun intended)
&gt; and let someone else do the work on my bus. My last experience with taking
&gt; my bus to a&quot;VW experienced&quot;
&gt;  mechanic was  bad one and I was hoping that someone could point me in the
&gt; right direction.
&gt;                                                 Thanks,
&gt;                                                 Mike Leddy
