&gt;Usually it goes out right away: 1-2 seconds. I've found that with

This only happens in the morning or if my bus sat for 8+ hours
while at work.

&gt;The second valve limits overall oil pressure. The solid lifter
&gt;engines have two, the hydraulic lifters engines have one.

&gt;There is a better photo of this diagram on page 40 of Wilson.

So the 2.0L has one to protect the oil cooler, since thats probably
more important.

I just have this feeling that either the required air is not getting
to my oil cooler or my oil cooler is not getting the normal amount
of oil (being bypassed). This would account for my normal head temps
but high oil temps.

Can I get to the flaps and oil cooler without pulling the engine?
