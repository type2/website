Subject: Tranny Fluid Change
Mime-Version: 1.0

I was reading Muir last night, and he recommended to change the tranny 
fluid every 30,000 miles. Since I have never done this, and I am sure the 
PO didn't either it has been at least that long. I wanted to find out how 
much was required and how to do it, so I checked Bently, and it states that 
changing the fluid is not required after 1970.

Which should I believe? It still seems like a good idea, but I figured I 
would ask. I am planning on traveling from Sacramento to Tucson and back 
this weekend, and so I have been trying to get the bus in the best shape 
possible before I go.

Thanks,
-Nick
