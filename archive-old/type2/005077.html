Subject: Panel replacement on my cargo floor area in Westy

Well, I have to order the universal replacement panel for my Westy made by
VENG in Denmark. I have about 5-6 holes about half dollar size, or 1&quot;
across. I have bought Corroseal to convert and seal the remianing rust. My
thought was to place the new panel over the old one after Corrosealing it as
well, tack it in place, then undercoat under the Westy. Any thoughts on
this? It seems reasonable as long as the rust is all converted, as opposed
to breaking the hundreds of spot welds and tacking/butting the new panel
over the crossmembers etc.
I'd appreciate anyone's thoughts on this, (especially if you have
experience, and aren't just guessing. :-)    )
Thanks,
Courtney'
