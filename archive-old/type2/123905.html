Subject: Sloppy shifter

My gear shift is very sloppy in my '71.  I just checked the coupler
right before the tranny and it looks fine.  The only major play is
directly under where the shifter comes underneath.  It comes into a T
piece with one side holding the rob going to the back the other riding
on a &quot;peg&quot; sticking out.  It has a lot play on this peg.  Should it?  Is
it the &quot;shift rod bushing?&quot;  Bus Depot has no less than 4 parts of
similar names, but different part numbers.  Can some one please help me
with what part #s I need to hopefully clean this slop up?  TIA!
 
Have a good one,
Eric Shook
