Subject: Re: [T2] Heating

&lt;.  air intake is under the dash.
.  VW Air Conditioner blower motor is used to cycle the air
.  two ducts from blower to under the bus
.  BA-4 is mounted transversely under the front on the old A/C evaporator
mount (or is that condenser, never could keep which is which straight)
.  the hot air from the BA-4 is ducted into the stock heat duct just
behind the front beam.
.  sperate controls are mounted on a panel filling the ash tray opening in
the dash.&gt;

I'll be you could roast hot dogs in there during a blizzard! Nice setup!
