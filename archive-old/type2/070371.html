Subject: Drink Holder Placement?

Hi.

Michele and I are getting everything ready for our first trip in our '81 
Westy...almost there!  Just waiting for my head temp. guage to come in so's I 
can install it, an oil temp guage, and fix some oil leaks (all in one swell 
foop!)  Also, there is the joyous experience of outfitting the van for comfort. 
One thing we're having a problem with is where to put the drink holders?  I 
don't want drinks on the dash, but I would like to have my java within easy 
grab/replace range with much stability...and out of the way.

Any suggestions?

Thanks,
Gene
