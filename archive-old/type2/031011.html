&gt; Ok I replaced my heater boxes with J-Tubes, runs a lot quiter but one side has a small exhaust leak, is there a special clamp I can use where it meets  the muffler? If so please let me know where I can find it. Thanks. Also am I harming the heads by not having heater boxes under them that the tin surrounds so that the air can blow through? Seems to me that more air can get to them with the j-tubes in.

never heard of J-tubes having an effect one way or the other, certainly
the dune buggies and baja conversions have long done it.  and I have had
the heater boxes and the very bottom tin removed from my 78 for years and
have not detected any changes on my guages much less the engine.
