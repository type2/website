Subject: RE: need '79 sliding door interior handle

&gt; I am also looking for this handle for my '77 bus.  I found them
&gt; to be around $40.00 at www.gowesty_dot_com  I also checked with the FLAPS in
my
&gt; neighborhood and they quoted me the same price.


These are about to go down in price by about 50 percent, as I am now
importing them myself.  I normally sell them for $35 but the new price will
be $19.95.  Quantities will be limited at first, as they are arriving in
dribs and drabs.  There will be enough to fill all orders, but backorders
will be possible for the first couple of months.  These are genuine VW, same
as original, and fit 74-79.  The little cap that covers the screw is sold
separately for $1.75.  This is a case where anyone who ordered my new
catalog would be alerted to the price reduction,  since it is already listed
there for the new price.
