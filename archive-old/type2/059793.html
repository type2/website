Ok...  I found out that the timing was over 10 degrees retarded.  Ouch!!!

I have noticed before that I get very different readings when I static
time the bus vs. when I use a gun.  This has puzzled me in the past, and I
guess it still does.  However, when looking at some of the manuals, it
seems like 71 is the first year when it seems to be important to use a gun
vs. a static light.  Not sure why, although I presume it has something to
do with the vacuum advance.

Total advance is around 25 deg. right now, and I may bump it up to 28 or
so just for good measure.  Emissions were around 3% CO2 (I think) which
was ok.  I'll keep an eye on this and see what happens, but this is a good
lesson to learn when timing, as I use a static light on my 65 bug and now
will use a gun on my 71 bus.

Maybe that was common knowledge, but it is news to me.  And I'm glad it
wasn't something worse than that.:)
