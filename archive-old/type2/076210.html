Subject: Generator light.

Hey everyone.  I have a really annoying problem.  My NEW battery keeps dying 
and i keep having to recharge it, Sometimes the generator light comes on 
dimly, or flickers while im driving.  it also lights up a little when the 
turn signal is going and when i press the brake petal.  i have a cd player, 
and i thought that might be it, and i havent been using it lately, but im not 
sure.  how can i check if the generator is working properly?  I believe it 
was replaced in 96 or 97.  and what is the correct battery for a 1970 std. 
bus?  Thanks a bunch everyone.!
