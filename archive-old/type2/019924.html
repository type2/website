Subject: Re:[T2} steering wheel alignment

Chrissie:
If you live in any area subject to rust Dave Schimpf's answer is likely
the applicable one. BTDT!
Important as brakes are, I'd rather have them fail than the steering!
When the center pivot mount failed on my 69 pickup was the only time a
tow truck entered into my type 2 experience!
The really lucky thing about this is that it nearly always happens when
the vehicle is not moving or barely moving, because much more force is
being applied to the steering wheel at this time!

Dear Chrissie,

&gt;We had similar symptoms with a bus. What happened was that the metal &gt;box that
&gt;anchors the steering mechanism to the axle beam had begun to rot out,
&gt;gradually pulling away from the axle beam. Look under the middle of the
&gt;front of the bus, where the steering mechanism attaches to the middle &gt;of
&gt;the axle beam. Check out how that box is attached to the axle beam (it
&gt;should take about a minute). If it releases completely, you can't steer &gt;the
&gt;bus, which is a bad thing.

&gt;The box can be rewelded to the axle beam under certain circumstances.

&gt;Please get it checked out, though.

&gt;Good luck!
