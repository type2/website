Subject: Seat Belts

Greetings all,
    I know this is a bit late, but I'll give it a shot. I am looking for
some seatbelts to use on the rear seat of my 70 Westy. I tried some out of a
Beetle, but they are too short. If anyone has some and would like to sell
them, bring them to EBus. Pmail me with the cost and the other particulars.
Later,
Jim
Hampstead, NC
'70 Westy - § - The Bus formerly known as &quot;Frito&quot;
