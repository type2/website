Subject: Trip report: Shakedown cruise in SB front country.

In our last thrilling episode, I finally got our beloved two-tone '78 Westfalia 
to pass smog, with a restored egr system, and fuel mix adjustment.

All tuned up and ready to go, my adventuresome wife and I set out for Big 
Caliente hot springs down the long and windy road that allegedly started the 
whole hot tub thing many years ago. It's about 40 miles as the crow flies, and 
about 2 hours 45 minutes as the Westy creeps up and down the 3500' Santa Lucia 
Range in Santa Barbara County, CA. Story goes, some local hotspring pilgrim 
finally conceived of building a hot tub in their backyard (then a novel concept)
rather than make that long, dusty drive one more time. Truly a defining moment 
in California's cultural history. But I digress.

This is very impressively rugged country. On the drive up San Marcos pass, I 
pull over twice to let about two and a half bazillion weekenders pass me in 
their high powered, modern froofroo-mobiles. One waves and graciously calls 
out,&quot;Thanks,&quot; but the rest speed by without a word. We part company with all of 
them at the ridgetop. The road starts by winding for miles along a high, 
serrated knife-edge of a ridgetop, ocean fog blowing over the ridge then 
dissipating in the dry interior. Spectacular views stretch for 30 miles on 
either side. The bus displays a conspicuous lack of guts on the upgrades, and my
finely tuned &quot;bus sense&quot; pops a red flag. I check timing on a high ridge with my
strobe and it reads about 12 degrees BTDC at idle. Odd, I  I set it at 7.5 last 
week, and the smog guys said it was at 6. I readjust to 7.5 and we go on. Engine
is cool enough and quiet, so I'm not too worried. 

The track then slowly worms its way down the backside of the range into the 
chaparral canyons of the Los Padres National Forest. Signs give ambiguous 
warnings about substandard road conditions and storm damage ahead. Shorty after 
a turn where floodwaters have taken one lane of the road down a cliff to a place
far, far below us, the pavement ends. A nicely graded, tortuously winding dirt 
road takes over. Many miles later, we come through oaks and California bays to 
willows, alders and sycamores and cross the upper reaches of the Santa Ynez 
River, here reduced to a small trickle of a creek. We are cheered by the sight 
and smell, since we had come filled with stories of how dry and hot it would be 
back here in August. We come to the first of what will become a whole series of 
lovely, clean, uncrowded, free Forest Service campgrounds. Dusty, shady groves 
of coast live oaks beckon. 

We press on, along the creek for a few miles, then up and over another ridge. 
Bus is still cringing a bit on the upgrades; it's not the timing. We come to 
another flowing creek and stop to splash our feet and play tag with the little 
fish in the sunny pools ringed by cattails and cottonwoods. A few miles up the 
road, we come to the hot springs! Pretty civilized for a spring you can drive 
to. Little trash, nice facilities, little concrete pool in the shade of a few 
volunteer planted pines and palm tree. A pipe brings hot spring water from a 
nearby bluff to the pool. A large valve controls hot water into the pool, and a 
long hose makes for easy cleanup. We plop down and spend a relaxing late 
afternoon bathing and sipping beer, chatting with a nice Mexican guy, his two 
very well behaved little sons, and friendly dog. 

This is a nice place. Behind us a creek murmurs quietly. Around us, yuccas, 
white sage, and manzanitas climb steep rocky slopes. Someone has undertaken to 
make an evocative image of a rattlesnake on the edge of the tub with dark, 
polished stones pressed into smooth concrete. On a nearby rock, a little stone 
compass rose  bears the inscription,&quot;Respect this place.&quot; It seems that most 
visitors do. The family leaves, bidding us a friendly,&quot;Hasta luego.&quot; Now alone, 
we enjoy a nekkid soak.  I wash off the area surrounding the pool, then use the 
hose as a siphon to get a little crud off the bottom. Shanna tells me I'm 
working too hard. She's right. I take a break. Later another couple arrives, 
parks at a respectful distance, and prepares to camp up the creek a ways. Well 
unwound now, we take our leave and the guard changes as evening comes on.  

There is no overnight camping at the spring, so we backtrack a few miles to a 
shady oak campground for dinner and the first night in our wonderful poptop bed 
in a while. The old propane tank under the sliding door needs to be inspected by
fire marshal before it can be filled again, so I travel with a 2.5 gallon tank 
of my own on the luggage rack. A hose long enough to come in the poptop window 
connects to a campstove I set on the countertop. This workable arrangement 
yields dinner  shortly and we eat outside in the gathering darkness, listening 
to crickets and the creek. This is only a weekend trip, so we put dishes in a 
tub to be washed when we get home and climb upstairs for a very restful night's 
sleep. 

Next morning, we meet the Mexican family again. They give us an avocado, we give
them some tortillas. They tell us about a swimming hole down the way. We pack up
and return to the hot spring to enjoy a solitary morning soak. The pool is sunny
in the morning, but it's been foggy on the coast all summer and the sunshine is 
a welcome change. 

Nearby is a little cinderblock bathhouse. By the spring is a long hose. A woman 
drapes the hose over the top of the bathhouse and takes a private shower with 
her daughter. We pick up a little trash and set out to find a shady place to nap
away the heat of the day. 

We wake up in the early PM in another shady oak grove, lunch, and set out to 
find the swimming hole. We come around a bend just in time to see a young bobcat
bounding across the road. It leaps onto a boulder and disappears into a thicket 
of sagebrush. We are thrilled.

My front brakes begin to make squeaky squeels. I think it's just dust from the 
dirt roads on the disks. Later when we are back on pavement, they quiet down 
again, apparently supporting my theory. 

A few more miles of windy dirt road takes us up and over another ridge to a 
spectacular view of one of the biggest and best remaining riparian forests left 
in southern California, at the top of Gibraltar Reservoir. Haven to all kinds of
rare and endangered animals, this is a special place for wildlife. Down the back
side of the ridge, we come to Mono campground, another shady oak grove next to a
lovely and rare riparian meadow recently fenced against vehicular traffic for 
protection, but still open to people on foot. A short walk brings us to a large 
debris dam built by the CCC back in the 1930's to keep sediment out of the 
reservoir below. There is a big, green swimming hole below the dam, and a wide, 
flat bottomland above. Bats live in the dark recesses of the dam and deer tracks
lead upstream. This is a great place to bring birdwatchers, kids, or 
naturalists. There are lots of swallow nests on the eaves of the dam, but no 
swallows in sight. Where do they go in the summer that's nicer than right here? 

There is another hot spring a few miles hike up the trail, but we'll leave that 
for another time. With thoughts of home grown tomatoes and basil for dinner, we 
get ready to head home. As an experiment, I disconnect my egr from the throttle 
for the return trip and find the bus immediately recovers some pep. It doesn't 
run noticeably hotter. I take mental notes.

Two and a half windy twisty hours later, we are back in the land of freeways and
coastal fog. It was a nice little shakedown trip for the bus in preparation for 
the heavy Baja run to come later this summer. And we were both stoked to learn 
how nice the camping is on the other side of the mountains. It would be a bad 
place to get stuck in winter mud, but we'll be back soon during the other three 
seasons of the year.  :-)

That's all from the Left Coast. May your next bus trip be as relaxing and 
pleasant.

Drive safely,
Surfer Bob
