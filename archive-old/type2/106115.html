Subject: HELP! I need a 2L long block

Hello list,
My good friend just blew up his 2L engine in his 76 Westy.  I am looking to find him a GOOD rebuild or an STRONG running used motor.

Does anyone know of a reputable rebuilder with T4 long blocks ready to ship??? Time is a big issue here.  I've heard plenty bad stories about mail order engines - Someone must be doing good work out there???  

We are in NC (Asheville) and are willing to drive anywhere in the south for a good motor (rebuilt or used).

Please help!

Thanks,
Eric
