Subject: RE: [T2] 1969 sc wiring

Jerry and Dave,

It also depends on how early or late your '69 is. The early ones use the
'68/'69 diagram and the late ones use a '69/'70 diagram. '69 can be a very
strange year. The later '69 models can be identified if your harness has
provisions for rear side marker lights, but no lights.

The one thing the '69 won't use is the '68 only 9 pin flasher relay.

However, early '69 models sometimes use a two prong emergency flasher
switch, which is a one-year only part. This can be confusing.

If it does use the early style hazard switch Chris at BustedBus has a few
good ones. They look very similar to a defrost switch.

Hope this helps in addition to Mark's link.

Good morning, Lehan, Dave (lehandc_at_wellsfargo_dot_com)

Does anyone happen to know where I can find the CORRECT wiring diagram for
the 69 single cab? The one on thesamba is pretty accurate I guess except for
the relay controlling the turn signals and emergency flashers (which happnes
to be the bits I'm trying to get to work right now.)
