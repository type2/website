&gt; &gt;Am I crazy for thinking about doing this? Turning in a perfectly good modern

&gt; Meredith,
&gt; 
&gt; My advice to you is to keep the Odyssey or trade it in for a larger 
&gt; late-model vehicle if you must.  With three little ones you will not have 

I have to agree (father of 6) on the time issue.  if any of the above
conditions were different, no children, mechanical experience, spare
vehicle I would say different but even a small breakdown (is there such a
thing) with a small child crying can be a major stress event.

&gt; time, the bus would still be a risk.  It is an old vehicle with few modern 
&gt; safety features.  Compared to a modern vehicle like your Odyssey, it is 

?? I am not sure tha Odyssey is that much better than a late model
(78-79) bus for the passengers.  front seat is more risky for frontal
impact though.  however the VW Bus is a pretty touch vehicle despite it's
apperance.

&gt; relatively unreliable (even if properly maintained!  Yes!), and relatively 

any vehicle can be reliable or unreliable depending on circumstances, BUT
all other things being equal, yes a newer vehicle is likely to be more
reliable than an older one but how it is maintained is also important.

&gt;  If you must get a bus, go ahead by all means, but don't rely on it 
&gt; as your daily driver.

another alternative would be to sell your new car, get a bus AND an older
Dodge minivan (lots of good cheap ones out there) and drive both as you
learn how to get the bus in order

of course if you MUST have a VW bus,  the new Eurovans are nice
