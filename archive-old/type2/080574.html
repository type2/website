Subject: Re: [T2] Re;Heating possiblities 

Kathy and Paul sends:

&gt;   Now, if you need to be formally dressed at your destiantion and want to
&gt; be warm while you drive there, beg, borrow, or rent a new car with real
&gt; heat.   :-)

We have Busses, people. Being warm while you drive and formally dressed
while you're at your destination is what curtains are for! Drive to where
you need to be, put up your curtains, go in the back and change.

You could always just get a set of Key coveralls two sizes too big (visit
http://www.joesugars_dot_com for those) and pull them over your suit, but
where's the fun in that?
