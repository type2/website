Greg,
My wife, dog and I just did a great trip from Burbank, through the desert to Grand Canyon and north of Pheonix in my '73 Westy. 
http://www.home.earthlink_dot_net/~sparkomatic/Grand_Canyon_Trip1.htm
My advice is to check out Flagstaff, Sedona, The Canyon (everybody should see it once) and the Aspen forests north of Flagstaff. As for the desert you can't go wrong just about anywhere around Pheonix and there's some excellent hiking, bike and motorcycle riding to be found also in the area. I think your gonna just miss the wild flower desert bloom which was amazing this year due to heavy snow and rain.
Have a great time!
