&gt; Another tip for anyone interested:
&gt; 
&gt; If you have a late bay (73-79) with the turn signal lenses up high, you can
&gt; remove the lens and drill through the 2 rivets holding the houseing in.
&gt; Slide it out and viola....you can stick your hand right in and undo the
&gt; speedometer and look at all your wiring.

Thank you SO much for this tip.  It should be invaluable for anyone with
underdash a/c.  It's impossible to get up under the dash to do anything
if you're not rubberman.
