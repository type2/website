Subject: Re: JBwelds*cks need oil filler tube

Okay, with this thread continuing, I'll go ahead and go on the record
telling the whole world that I'm now driving a bus with an engine repaired
with JBWeld. I lost an oil galley plug some weeks ago and couldn't manage
to repair the hole any other way than to do the JB Weld thing in the oil
galley.

What I did was this: 

1. Cut a metal plug and meticulously filed to create a resistance-fit slug.
2. Meticulously cleaned the hole where the oil galley plug came out. Used
nail polish remover as a solvent to get out the oil.
3. Put the plug in.
4. Mixed up and filled behind the plug with JBWeld.
5. Capped the hole with a nickel on the outside, since the JBWeld was
trying to ooze out.
6. Waited 48 hours before cranking the engine again.

Now, this begs the question: do I trust it?

Well, I've ordered another engine from AVP if that answers your question.
This is a bandaid on what could be a mortal wound. I'll be happy if it gets
me back and forth to work until I can get the other engine here and
installed. I fully expect to repair this with a proper metal plug (probably
an NPT-threaded cap-type fitting of some sort). Problem is, this will
require removal of the engine and splitting of the case and history has
proven it's not a weekend job for me. 

I've driven to work in the bus twice since the fix. Temps never got over
200; oil pressure went up to about 75 at startup.

Good thing the tooth fairy just paid me a visit! :) Joe
