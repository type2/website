&gt; Grrrrr.  Was washing my 78 VW T2 ASI/Riviera today

&gt; I could hear the sound of the crack over the flow of
&gt; water, and immediately noticed the new vertical line.
&gt;
&gt; Is this common?

How cold was the water and how hot was the windshield? I've heard of  
people cracking their frozen windshields with hot water so I wonder  
if the opposite is also true. In the first case, there was a crack to  
begin with and the thermal stress caused it to run.
