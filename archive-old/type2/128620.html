Subject: Re: [T2] F.I. to Weber carb conversion on a 2litre

Just let it snow once... That ought to convince 'em!!! &lt;grin&gt; 

Been there done that. Traded my &quot;spare&quot; center mount off to a fellow that was cussing his EFI. He got the carb, I got to remove ALL of his fuel injection. To be fair I did explain what he was getting and what he was giving up. I was certainly happy to have the spare EFI parts. Never did hear from him if he got the carb running the way he wanted. 

Chris
