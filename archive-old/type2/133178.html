Subject: Re: [T2] Front Brake Pads

David,

For what its worth....mine have never squeeked.

However, new pads on the F**d squeeked the first 1,000 miles then quit.

Cheers, dave

&gt; Here's my feedback - I don't particularly like the Pagid pads.  What's 
&gt; that?  Heresy you say?  Well I don't care.  I ponied up doublt the bucks 
&gt; recently for the Pagid pads and shoes, new brake hoses and a new rotor to 
&gt; boot.  Now I have always had a slight problem with the front brake pads 
&gt; squealing.  Not all the time, and not very loud, but it was there.  I 
&gt; chalked it up to the cheap FLAPS pads I was using.  When I pulled the cheap

&gt; I guess my point is that if you're expecting great things from the Pagid 
&gt; pads, my experience suggests that you not get your hopes up.
