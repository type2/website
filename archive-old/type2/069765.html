Ok, the point of all this is my tranny.  I can accelerate through all the
gears just fine, including 2nd.  The problem arises during downshifting.  If
I try to drop down to 2nd to go around a corner or just to slow down I get
this horrible &lt;gnaaakkkkkckssckhh&gt; sound and it won't go.  If I really,
really, insist it will go but it'll pop right out.  Does this sound like new
tranny time or just a long-needed adjustment?

sounds bad.    start looking for a new trans.  

but in the mean time, change your trannnnnnnny oil and add that slick 50
tranny stuff.    i suggest draning it after driving it to get it warmed up
and stirred up
