Subject: removing oil-sump plate
Message-ID: &lt;374DA2ED.EF078F16_at_jps_dot_net&gt;

Hey list geniuses,
                        I recently got my engine back from a rebuild by
AVP and am trying to replace the oil sump plate with a different one I
have that has an oil-temp sender in it. But though I've removed the
screws, I cannot seem to get that sucker off there. AVP coated the
circumference of the plate with silicone and that seems to be holding it
in. Also I can't really get a purchase on the thing and don't want to
ruin the sealing areas by gouging screwdrivers in there.. Any ideas?
