&gt; &gt;      So, here's my question.  Do I drive an automatic, or a standard?
&gt; &gt;  I'm scared to take my standard on any hills around here, because I don't
&gt; &gt;  want to stall it and roll backwards into other cars.  That's like, my
&gt; &gt;  worst fear.
&gt; 
&gt; Yes an auto bus will have less power to the wheels than a manual bus with the 
&gt; same engine, but its probably not enough to worry about.

my auto bus (78 2L) has handled any grade I have put it on, and I ski so I
find some pretty steep ones, now slow is part of the picture though

&gt; Going up steep hills you would be using 1st and 2nd gear a lot - but with an 
&gt; auto you would probably be selecting 1st and second anyway. Going up hill you 

that's the nice thing about an auto tranny, you really can't select the
wrong gear or lug the engine because the tranny will select the gear you
need and is best for the engine and conditions

&gt; Going down hill you need to save the brakes and there is much truth and 
&gt; wisdom in the addage that you should only go down a hill in the same gear as 
&gt; you would drive up that hill - use engine braking to stop your brakes burning 
&gt; up.

well one of the problems with the auto tranny is that the VW tranny really
is not that great for engine brakeing.  and it would need to be a D**n
steep grade before I would manually lock the tranny in first, 2nd however
I do use on grades, but the tranny will upshift anyway if you overspeed.

what I do is pump the brakes on hard then totally release for a bit rather
than riding the brakes.  (Many years ago I drove the big buses and this is
how you had to come down steep grades with air brakes and a 40,000lb
vehicle)

&gt; Once you have the knack its actualy quite difficult to roll backwards as you 
&gt; balance the clutch and gas pedals with the hand brake on, when the van is 
&gt; just trying to move forward, keep the pedals still, release the hand brake 
&gt; (keep your hand on the brake just in case) appling a tiny bit more gas then 

and again with the big buses you have &quot;off/on&quot; parking brakes so using the
hand brakes was not an option, so heel/toe became a way of life, (heck I
double clutched my 71 van)  
  I had my right foot on the brake and left on the clutch, to start on a
hill I would slide my foot up the pedal and twist to the right and push my
toe down onto the gas pedal and let up on the clutch, as soon as I felt
the engine take up the load I slid my heel off the brake and off I went

&gt; gently releasing the clutch as you apply more gas. Of course with an auto you 
&gt; have only one pedal to balance the van with which could make life easier.

the auto is not so much easier as &quot;different&quot;

good luck
