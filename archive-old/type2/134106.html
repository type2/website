Subject: Re: [T2] !_at_!_at_#% Key CAME out!

My sincere thanks for all the folks who wrote.  I got a number of 
great responses including a great link on how to get the lock apart. 
As I was laying out my tolls for that job, in comes this simple idea 
I should not have missed from Bob -- IT WORKED!!!!!
&gt;
&gt;well if the key went in it should come out,  sounds like a tumble is
&gt;sticking.  I would squirt some WD40 or similar down in the key slot
&gt;(disconnect the battery) if the key can be worked loose ok, if not I would
&gt;then let some light oil drip into the cyl and continue to work the key up
&gt;and down, you want to get the key out in the off position if you can...
&gt;
&gt;then when you get it out, get a key made to the key code on the lock and
&gt;squirt some graphite in the keyhole and use the new key, your key is
&gt;probably worn
&gt;
&gt;&gt;  quick way to pop the lock without removing the steering wheel, etc.?
&gt;&gt;  Or a known way to release the tumblers?  Also, the key I have is the
&gt;&gt;  ONLY key to the back gate which is now locked.  Arrrrgh!
&gt;
&gt;oh yeah, unlock the rear hatch when you get the key out
&gt;
&gt;Bob

Thanks Bob, and everyone else for their kind responses and not 
calling me names for forgetting to lubricate the locks!  They are all 
well-oiled now!
