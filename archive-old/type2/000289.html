yeah this is rasdave again :) i would like to apologize for my post if i had
offended anyone about talking about illegal activities (soon to be legal) on
this mail list.

i just wish the people would put aside their political and religous beliefs
for a second and use common sense about what we put into our bodies.
sometimes when we have a headache its easier to run to the bathroom cabinet
and pop 2 or 3 of those cute little white pills that call our name when our
heads are about ready to explode. sometimes they may be cute little orange
pills, or cute little red and yellow pills. hmmmm, its starting to sound
like a frat party isnt it? yes, apsirin and headache medications are drugs
too. we should check those out instead of just taking them to hide our
pains. do peopl know advil will DESTROY your kidneys if you take them over
time?  no, we just go out and buy them and take them becuase they work so
good. i am not sitting here (does that mean i am typing standing up?)
advocating the explicit use of smoking herb either. we all know very well
what inhaling anything can do to our bodies. (so this is why i recommend
brewing it in tea form :) i would just much happier if people thought more
about the real drugs that we blindly put into our bodies becuase &quot;its
stitting on the store shelf so it must be safe&quot; or &quot;good ole doc baker gave
it to me so it must be good&quot;. &lt;-- for all you &quot;little house on the prairie&quot;
buffs:) i would be very ascared of aspirin myself becuase it was once a
harmless bark used down in south america...the indians chewed on it and it
helped their headaches, now american scientists come along and take the bark
and extract the natural stuff in it that helps headaches and they make a
white pill that is 50 times more potent than its natural form. no wonder why
you can die if you take to many! for more information about these topics i
recomend visiting dr. andrew weils website at: http://www.drweil_dot_com/

on a bus note: in the process of helping a friend rebuild his 63
crewcab..and looking for various parts such as rear tailgate, new fuel tank,
panels between fueltank and crewcab interior, lets see what else..._dot_complete
interior parts, lock for the engine lid....those are the most important.

on my 74 bus: i really love this email list becuase i bought a $1000 bus
with a bad engine over 3 years ago and THE LIST (meaning all members) gave
me tips and courage to put things back together and do it right. many times
over i thank the person who recomended me to AVP, the countless people ive
bought or traded parts from, bus depot for getting those hard to find (at
least for me) camper interior handles, the person who sold me a whole entire
camper interior, the people who took the time to explain how to hook up the
thermostat for my flaps, and on and on! i really love the &quot;vw idiots guide
book&quot; and my owners manual, but to be honest the LIST has helped me much
more! thanks everyone :)

rants &amp; diatribes over :)
rasdave - getting ready to go work on a bus! (thank god its not mine!)
