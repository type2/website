Subject: Re: [T2] when does the spark plug fire?

Mike iirc you still have the case halves apart? correct? Just last
night I put the halves of my 1600 back together so what I did is fresh
in my mind.

if you align up the 2 dots on the crank gear w/ the 1 dot on the cam
gear you at least can be sure that those are in sync. I then rotated
the crank untill the #1 cyl (this will be the 2nd cyl from the
flywheel) was at the top of it's stroke. Then looked at the cam. If
it's at the TDC when it fires both valves should have been closed, so
that the cam lobes should now be facing away from the #1 cyl. if the
lobes point up then rotate the crank 360 degrees and look again. with
this setup you should be able to rotate the entire case half a bit on
the stand to see the distributor gear hole. the bentley has a nice
picture in the engine section that shows what the gear top (where the
distributor actually connectes to) should look like. iirc it's
something like 12 degrees off from perpenducular w/ the case seam but
look it up first.

what you should have when finished is the distributor gear inserted
and looking like the bentley pic. the cyl #1 rod at it's highest
point and the cam lobes for the #1 &amp; 3 cyl pointing downward. with
this setup you are golden. just rotate the crank back to double check
that the dots line up on the two gears and start working on sealing
the case. good luck.
