Subject: Starting Problem

Gang:

I just returned from Baja, Mexico drove from LA to Cabo San Lucas and back
in a week, in my brothers 78 CamperMoblie.  However, the camper has a
problem.  After a long trip at high speeds or across the hot desert when the
car gets really hot.  It will fail to start.  Basically you turn the key and
you hear the starter shoot out to engage the fly wheel, however the starter
never spins up.  

Crossing the desert and arriving at a military checkpoint outside of San
Ignacio, we had to stop the car for inspection and then since it didn't
start push it out of the way.  If we let the motor cool it will start.
However at 2:00 pm in 110 degree heat we waited 2 hours before running out
of patients.  So we used a spare spark plug wire to short the starter
(laying under the car) -- which made it spin but not engage and then keyed
it to engage.  Long story short it is not fun to restart your car this way
when the engine is hot.

Can anyone tell me where I should start?  Has anyone seen, heard about, or
had this problem?

Details: 78 Campermoblie Automatic, Fuel Injection.  I see in the wiring
diagrams it has a thermostat on one of the cylinders can this tell the start
not to engage?  

Thanks in advance,
Wayne
