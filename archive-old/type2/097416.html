Subject: Re: [T2] Times they are a changing

My love affair with buses started very early, about 1953 or so when I saw
one of the first ones ever imported, at a VW dealer, and marveled. About
eight years later my brother and I and six buddies ponied up $400 and
actually bought a used early 23-window. It made several trips back and forth
across country until ending its career unceremoniously around a tight corner
and into telephone pole. It was only a few weeks later that the registered
letter came informing us that this was indeed a very rare and early bus, one
of the first imported, and would we be interested in selling?

Fastforward to 1975. I am walking a dog around the environs of Lake Anne in
Reston, VA., and a large group of folks are whooping it up at an outdoor
table, quaffing wine while the stars shine. It looks like fun. I hang around
until one of them invites me to sit down. They are regulars and I join them
almost every night. Among the group is a striking redhead there, the wife of
a psychiatrist, sexy as hell and a good drinker. One evening I walk her to
the parking lot and SHE HAS A BUS! A 1969 Westy. I am in love! A few weeks
later I move in with her. She is separated from her husband but has custody
of their upscale house. Turns out the bus is hers thanks to my predecessor,
a footloose hippie who since wondered off.

But her Nordstrom roots run deep and she secretly lusts for a Buick. When
the Buick dealer offers her $1800 for the Westy in trade, I seize the Bay!

We part company, and I drive Chianti-clad Schatzie up and down the coast, to
Boston for an affair with my old high school/college flame, but long
distance relations are hard even with a bus and I'm looking at my life and
it doesn't look all that great. I am getting older,  pushing 40, and have
been divorced for five years with nothing to show but debts and an endless
string of failed relationships. It is beginning to dawn on me that the 1960s
are over and I better get with the times.

I trade it in Schatzie ($1200) on a new Ford Fiesta, which does change my
life. It is clean, it is neat, it is respectable. When a young TV reporter
walks into my office I am actually able to impress not depress  her with my
choice of transport. Twenty-five years later we are still married, with two
kids almost grown.

Loves don't doe. Last year I bought a 1970 Westy and began a restoring her.
My thoughts go back to the 1960s. Not to the memories of which there are
many and good, but to something else. For those who never lived them, or
never lived them as I, it will seem very mysterious and hard to understand.
Perhaps it was then and remains now only a delusion. But for me and many of
my sojourning compatriots we felt the vibes in the air, and they were
wonderfully good. Without being able to articulate what it was that we knew
or felt, we did know that our generation, perhaps only temporally, had
stumbled onto something cosmically profound. Love without greed or
possessiveness, truth, happiness, non-material values. Whatever, it was
there and to me remains now the closest Buddha-trek and social-secular truth
I've ever come close too, a spiritual awakening for the ordinary.

It vanished from the air with the arousal of its antithesis, the aggressive
material spirit of the 80's and even weirder '90s.

When I'm in my bus and it's humming along I sort of back there, back to the
era when, hey, we all knew the truth .... Comes the revolution, as my
friends used to say.

The mountains of Mexico, the coasts of Carolina and California, the plains
of Texas, the blue skies by day glittering black by night .... the bus is
home, my home, to all of them.

Sorry for the long rant. I guess I got carried away.

John Rogers
