Subject: Window installation issue resolved

A couple weeks ago, I posted about some &quot;abnormally stubborn gaskets&quot; which would not get flush with the lip all the way around, even with copious amounts of silicone lubricant. I would like to tell you how we overcame this stubborness. Under the advice of a guy named Joe Little, we soaked each gasket it hot water for about 10 minutes before installation. As far as temperature of the water was concerned, he said, &quot;As long as you can put your hand in it, it's safe for the gasket.&quot; After soaking in the water, I dried the gasket all around and then applied the lubricant. As a result, the gasket popped in all the way around with little resistance. I hope this information is helpful to someone and thanks to all of you who offered your advice.                   -Paul Deatherage
