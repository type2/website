Subject: 82 vanagon hyd clutch

I replaced the clutch master cyl 3 months ago (BD). Bled it well, but after
2000+ miles and while on road trip, it started to loose function, Hard
shifting, clutch drag and grinding. Got it home and found air in system.
Checked system, found no leaks, bled system  and OK for about 2 weeks then
problem started again. After sitting overnight, the  clutch needs a double
pump the first time for clutch to work. Seems to hold after that. Bled again
and there is no air in system.

I'm thinking internal failure of clutch master cyl and will order a
replacement tomorrow unless anyone can suggest anything else.
