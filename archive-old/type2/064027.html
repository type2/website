Subject: Re: What to see (Northern AZ~NM)

&gt;Between Arizona and Louisiana there is nothing to see [except] Grand
Canyon...next stop New Orleans..

&gt;Mr. Hooper suggested-
&gt;Oh, quit. There is, too. Santa Fe, NM:, Taos, NM:, Velarde and Nambe:,
Espanola: =(, Los Alamos:, **Public &quot;bathrooms&quot;**...

Ellis adds suggestions within Northern Arizona for folks wishing to take the
slow and or scenic route(s):
Grand Canyon (North Rim is much different from South Rim)

&gt;From North Rim: Pass through Navajo/Hopi Reservations *gorgeous views!*
Travel to Springerville/Eager, AZ up through Alpine, AZ &lt;elevation 8300 ft&gt;,
*(see Camping Detour)* to Luna, NM (on the border) to Silver City, NM to
Albuquerque,NM to Santa Fe and Taos, NM and pick up on Kens' suggestions.

*(Camping Detour)*
The Vanbondo tribe loves to haunt the area anywhere between
Springerville/Eager and Alpine, AZ. This is the Apache-Sitgraves National
Forest. I *Highly* suggest getting a Natl Forest map and locating the area
in between the East and West Forks of the Black River. Excellent camping!!!
A jaunt down to Hannigans Meadow is also very very recommended especially in
late August through September.

&gt;From South Rim:
Travelers able to schedule time from the South Rim of the Grand Canyon(and
want back road beauty vs speed of &quot;getting there&quot;:
From South Rim to Flagstaff:
Take Hwy 89 south (passing the SanFrancisco Peaks ~1 and 2 highest Mountians
in AZ) Flagstaff on Hwy 89A south/Lake Mary Road passing Happy Jack, AZ to
Payson, AZ to ShowLow, AZ through Pinetop/McNary passing SunRise Ski resort
by Mt. Baldy (third higest Mountian in AZ) go to Big Lake. *(see Camping
Detour)* Meander through the previously mentioned Apache-Sitgraves National
Forest/Black River area and pick up the Luna, NM route.

Haulin AZ (get there!) Route:
I-40 from Flagstaff to Albuquerque will hide all of the above scenery! I-40
is relatively flat, dry, windy and um, *not as nice* as the suggestions made
above. I-40 does allow pedal to the metal and getting there with a vengence.
If I-40 watch for the &quot;Dead Wash&quot; sign way out in the middle of no where.
About mile post 325-340? The sign sports several Thanks Jerry, ****enbroken,
and dancing bear stickers on it. Good for a quick picture taking scene if
you wanna risk the Arizona DPS stopping to join the picture taking and
&quot;consent to search&quot; party.

Northern Arizona is far from plain and is distinctly different than the
screaming hot desert of the southern half of the state. To say that there is
nothing to see in AZ other than the Grand Canyon would be like saying that
the only thing to see in NY state is the Empire State Building. Very wrong
on both accounts!

BTW: The public hwy roadside public rest stop &quot;bathroom&quot; in between Alb and
SantaFE, NM *is* the nastiest that I have ever encountered. I seriously have
seen single holers cleaner than that one was.
