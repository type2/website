Yeah, and I own George Washington's hatchet. The one he used to chop down
that cherry tree. It's had five new heads and eight new handles, but it's
the self-same hatchet, I swear!

PS: OBC- I keep the hatchet under then bench seat in my bus!

&gt; &lt;&lt; Oddly, new &quot;antique&quot; airplanes are often built with the manufacurers
data

&gt; restoration is often the money involved.

&gt; There was an interesting legal decision about that some years ago. A car
&gt; collector paid a handsome (more than the $16,000 Bus) price for a fam-
&gt; ous Bentley race car...Old Number One, I believe. Trouble was, there
wasn't
&gt; a single original piece on the car. It had gone through any number of re-
&gt; builds and modifications throughout its long life. The present owner sued
&gt; such that the car he bought couldn't be the one that was represented by
&gt; the seller. The court, however, reviewed all the historical data, and de-
&gt; cided that since each transformation was recorded, the vehicle or at
&gt; least the idea of the vehicle was the same...
