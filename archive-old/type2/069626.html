Yes, and Yes. 8)

At least on the '71, all you have to do is work your way down to the nut
under the horn button, extricate the nut, lift off the steering wheel
(with a puller), and then align it properly and reverse the procedure.
Problem is getting/or making a puller to do the job right...without
damaging the steering wheel or making you say words you thought you'd
forgotten. Once you get it off, it's an easy fix...but you'll curse me for
ever suggesting it's possible. 

Have fun! Joe

&gt; The tires are wearing evenly, which is what I really care about but
&gt; still, it would be nice to correct this problem.
