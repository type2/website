 &gt;&gt;How does the old owners manual know the type of tire
that we have.&lt;&lt;

it doesn't. it assumes that you have the stock size, which is usually 
the best choice in most cases.

unless you have a tire size that is waaaay off the stock size (a.k.a. 
BigFoot), then go by the PSI indicated in the owner's manual and/or 
Bentley.

 &gt;&gt;I just put Vanco's on my bus this week and the place the mounted
them put them all the way up to 65 psi.&lt;&lt;

i'm surprised a tire shop would put the pressure so high. don't go back 
there!

just my .02,
