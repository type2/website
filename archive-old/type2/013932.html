Subject: Re: [T2] engine rebuild

If you've never rebuilt an engine; I'd suggest that you get your hands on
a Hayes or Bentleys repair manual and read through it (browse it mostly)
and see what's involved.
If decide to go ahead with your rebuild run a quart of Marvel Mystery oil
with your regular engine oil for as long as you can before the teardown.
It also doesn't hurt to run a 1/2 quart with every tank of gas up till
you rebuild. The Mystery oil will clean your oil passages, crankcase
internally, lifters, pistons, piston tops and groves and just in general
remove all of the varnish buildup thats in there.
While you've got the engine out go ahead and repack your CV joints and
replace the boots.
When you put your pistons into the cylinders, be sure that your flywheel
is on the engine and the oil pump is NOT. The oil pump tends to jump out
of the drive slot when you turn the engine backwards on occasion during
the piston/ring replacement. Put your distributor drive and your
distributor in with the 12 degree angle set while you can still see the
top of the piston and the marks on the back of your flywheel.
Consider using new rod nuts and crank case nuts and washers, new head
bolt nuts and washers are a good idea too.
If you have AMC heads be certain of whether you need head gaskets or not,
AMCs normally don't use gaskets and OEM VW do use gaskets.
Even if your heads look good you need to have them inspected by a
qualified re builder, heads with 100K on them need new seats / valves and
guides even if they look good to you.
Use engine assembly grease on everything that looks like a bearing,
replace the pilot bushing in your bell-housing and your clutch pilot
needle bearing in the end of the crankshaft. Replace the felt seal and
*O* ring in your flywheel.
Don't trust new cylinder piston sets, check your end clearance on the
rings for each cylinder. Clean and lubricate the cylinder walls before
assembly and lube them good after assembly.
If you can (within your budget) replace the camshaft and lifters, about
an extra $180.00 on a good deal price.
If you do the job right you could get as much as 140K out of your new
engine before you have to go back in again.

Best of luck to you!
Take the list members advise if you buy a rebuilt engine, stay away from
re builders with bad raps you'll maybe -pay more but more once is better
than less twice.
