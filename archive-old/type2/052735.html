Steve,

It's not as difficult as I wanted to make it out to be.  When I got the
Adventurewagen a year ago, I went through a series of brake problems.  The lines
were the last thing I replaced, I wish now I had done them at the start.  I've
also replaced them on the single cab.

The most difficult issue is forming the new line to &quot;match&quot; the old ones you're
removing, but the good news is they don't have to be exact ( I've also heard
that you can get replacement brake lines that are pre shaped - although I don't
know from where - it would be interesting to see how the center brake line is
packaged for shipping!).  I just taped one end of the new line to the old and
then bent it to match the old one.

I bought mine from Bus Depot.  I made the mistake of just ordering one of each
listed on the web site for my year range.  I ended up with one very short line
(5-6 inches) that I could find anywhere on my bus.  If it's not a daily driver,
I'd be inclined to pull all the lines off (marking them as you go), measure
them, then place an order based on mm length.  I replaced five lines, the front
ones from the master cylinder to the flexible hoses (2), the long line from the
master cylinder to the rear &quot;T&quot; (1), and the two lines running from the &quot;T&quot; to
the rear flexible hoses (2).  I would recommend replacing them all, they're
cheap.

Tools?  The only special tool I recall using was a brake tube bender (2-3$ from
your FLAPS).  Good luck.
