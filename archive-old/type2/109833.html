Subject: Stewart Warner Heaters for sale.  Also Repair Service

Hello all,
I have several bus heaters for sale.  Units start at $250 and go up from 
there.
Units are rebuilt with new fuel lines, rebuilt fuel pumps and refurbished 
burners.
Wiring is checked and replaced as needed.  New hoses and paint for the nit.
I can also repair units that need it.  Let me know your needs.
You may contact me off the list at conv69864_at_cs_dot_com
Regards,
Al
