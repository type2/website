Subject: RE: [T2] Brosol 30/31vs Solex 34

  I had a lose of power going from the 34 pict 3 to the 30/31 adapter plate
carb. This is on a stock  brand new 1600 in my wife's (I know) bug. But
those that know me, know that none of my buses run stock engines. Her bug
got up to 30+ mpg on the freeway (are they really free anymore) and 25
around town, I have not tested the current mileage. 
  I think the lose of power and acceleration wasn't worth the change, but I
am always testing and wated to see the benifits or not of the change.

Hello List,

I would be interested in hearing from anyone who was using a Solex Pict 34
-3
on a 1600 DP and downsized to a Brosol 30/31 -3 using their adapter flange. 
I was wondering if you experienced any impacts on performance , gas mileage
or unplanned mechanical issues after the downsizing. 

Thanks for your help,

Joe Delecki
