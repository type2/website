&gt;I was told by the PO that my Van had an exchange engine and I am 
&gt;trying to work out what year model it is and whether that is true.
&gt;The van No is: 2292080102
&gt;and the engine No is: CJ019599X
&gt;It was first registerd in Germnay in January 1979 as a 2L model.
&gt;Am I looking at a 1978 or true 1979 and what is the difference?

The Bus is a 1979   7, 8, or 9- seater.   The engine number is missing 
a digit. If the number is actually  CJ0019599X then the case is from 
between 12-'75 and 8-'76. The X tells us that the engine was rebuilt 
at some point, it could have been a factory exchange unit. It might have 
been built up as a 1979 engine, it is also possible that only the short 
block was replaced, and that the original heads were re-used.

Hope it helps, 

Brian
