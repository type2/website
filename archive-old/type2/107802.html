Subject: new engine

Hello,
     I just installed a new engine from Boston Engine.  Of course it runs like
a champ. Bob Donalds did another fine job. I got my first engine from him
years ago. It went 100,000 mile without a burp. I pulled it because of a main
seal  leak and decided it was time for the whole thing. Bob is most helpful
and goes to the limit to make everything go smooth. I would highly recommend
his services.
Patrick
