&gt; For example: there are only two fuses (yes, only two) on the fuse block...
&gt; I
&gt; think there is another one inline with the fuel pump.  Anyway, one fuse is
&gt; always on and the other is ignition... simple.  The ignition switch on my
&gt; MGA has two positions On/Off... there is a separate starter switch and it
is
&gt; just a pull cable to a heavy duty switch in the engine compartment.  So if
&gt; you ever want to steal an old MG, you can either reach under the dash and
&gt; hot wire it or just put a paper clip between the fuses and pull the
starter.

its
underbonnet starter switch...OUCH... ;-(
