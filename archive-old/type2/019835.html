Subject: Clicking CVs

It looks like I toasted a CV.  The boot broke and I ignored it.  Just before I
pulled out the transaxle for an unrelated repair, I noticed a slight audiable
clicking when under load.  Got the trans back in Saturday and cleaned and lubed
the cvs and put new boots on.  The clicking is still there and it's coming from
the side that was ripped open and the cv grease all over the place.

Any suggestions?  If they are clicking, can they be taken apart and any rough
spots polished out or do I just toss them?

Thanks
