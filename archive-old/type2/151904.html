Subject: Re: [T2] 1979 Air Conditioning

JJ,

VPC= Volskwagen Products Corporation...it was at one time, a &quot;wholly owned 
subsidiary of vw&quot;.  Made all air cooled A/C and cruise controls and 
accesories.

Semi-difficult to switch over dependon on which &quot;original&quot; A/C system you 
have...VPC or someone else's.  

Change the dryer, change the compressor and oil, change/modify the 
compressor mount(depending), change compressor hose ends, check for leaks, 
charge with Freeze 12 and drive off into the sunset

Sigh, I've been promising to do a writeup since last year.

I guess it's time to pay the fiddler...and especially Richard, who sent me 
a genuine VPC mount instead of a DPD mount so i could try it....it is 
supposed to take almost no modification to put the rotary compressor on.

The rotary compressor came from Bus Depot, but is available from other 
sources...it has to have the &quot;right&quot; head on it so that the hoses will fit 
under the tin.

Cheers, dave

&gt; Dave, you mention the rotary compressor conversion. I have a
&gt; semi-functioning under-dash a/c unit in my '79... Does the compressor bolt
&gt; up in the same area as that for an overhead system? And How difficult is it
&gt; to convert to a rotar compressor? Where did you source yours (what's VPC?)?
&gt; Thanks-
&gt;

&gt; &gt; Peter,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I'm not sure that removing it would ruin the &quot;stock&quot; appeal...but a
&gt; &gt; functioning a/c in a bus has a certain appeal to some folks....who might
&gt; &gt; be willing to pay extra for it.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I have a 78 Champagne Edition with a fully functional overhead A/C
&gt; &gt; unit...with a rotary compressor change over....all *under* the stock tin
&gt; &gt; to avoid heat problems.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; The A/C unit was brand new out of the orignal VPC box last year....I heard
&gt; &gt; that they still have plenty of them....originally for 68-72 so you have to
&gt; &gt; come up with your own compressor mount for the late model t4 engine.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Cheers, dave
