Dave... 

Believe it or not, your mistake actually went to someone who has a solution. 
Here's what I did.

Go to boneyard.  Find correct bumper.  (doesn't have to be a 'good' one, just
the correct one)  Weld 3/16&quot; thick strap across the face of it.  Drill out
stock mounting hole through strap.  Make a couple four tabs from 2&quot; angle. 
Weld to strap about (I'll have to go measure...) 2 1/2' apart.  Fab towbar to
attach to tabs.  Attach coupler to fab'ed towbar.  Procure 4 longer bumper
mounting bolts.  

When the need to tow arises, remove stock bumper, replace with towbar bumper. 
Elapsed time, about ten minutes.  Hook up and haul away.  When not in use,
store under the elm tree in the back yard.

&gt; 
&gt; p.s. anybody have a solution to the tow bar problem ?
&gt; p.p.s.s. i made the late bus rear bumper work for a trailer
&gt; hitch by welding in 1/4 inch angle iron to stiffen it. also
&gt; moved the bumper bracket mount from the chassis to the
&gt; engine mount  with 1/8 inch wall square tubing. much safer...
