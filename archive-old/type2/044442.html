Did you check your distributor to see if the vacuum advance and the
mechanical advances are working correctly?

&gt; '78 Westfalia, 2.0 liter FI..naturally.
&gt; I take off in first gear just fine, but when I grab 2nd it hesitates bad,
&gt; almost dies, but if I toss it in 3rd and lug it, it goes. As soon as I'm up
&gt; to speed it's fine. It only does this after I've come to a stop. Idles fine.
&gt; I've done everything within my own power ie; plugs, wires, cap, rotor,
&gt; points, fuel filter.all cylinders are within specs as far as compression
&gt; goes. The only thing I couldn't do was check my fuel pressure....I don't have
&gt; the guage for it. I eliminated all of the easy stuff. If anyone has had a
&gt; similar problem and fixed it, I'd love to hear about it.
