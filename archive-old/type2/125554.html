I'm a curious about another point related to this issue.

How does the above mentioned ration of compression volumes relate to
the compression values you get using a compression gauge?

My compression numbers are all screwed up due to valve leakage, 
prompting me to purchase these new heads to correct the problem.

One is volume the other is pressure, right?

yes

**********
The compression ratio would have more to do with how much room
fuel/air have to expand on ignition, right?
***********

Compression ratio is simply the ratio of uncompressed volume (piston 
down) to compressed volume (piston up).

**************
The value you get from the compression gauge tells you (vaguely)
the condition of your rings and valve seats,

The value you get from a compression gauge will tell you how well all 
components that affect compression are working together.  This includes 
rings, pistons, valves, valve seats, heads (cracking) and head to 
cylinder seal.
