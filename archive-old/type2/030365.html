Volks,

I want first to thank you all from the bottom of my heart.  The response
to my request for donations was overwhelming!  In addition to the generous
donors listed below, I would like to thank Ron Salmon and the Bus Depot
for the match offer and Denis Joliffe for his donation of a computer to
host the lists and the web site.  As soon as the hard drive reaches David,
we will be on our own box and masters of our own fate :-)

If you sent a check, but do not see your name listed *please* let me
know!!!

                        Steve Dolan
                        Administrator, type2 list
