Subject: Re: When injectors won't ground:

1.- since it seemed to run a bit while cold start valve
&gt;was working, couldn't one make it fire all the time (the fuel sweeps in
&gt;when head valve opens), and you could limp along at the right throttle
&gt;opening, using the clutch to control your speed?, 

Interesting idea.  You might have to do some hefty rewiring of the cold 
start valve though to make it work all the time.  You would have to wire 
the thermo-time switch out of the circuit and you would have to somehow 
wire around the fact that the cold start valve only operates while the 
starter is operating.  Then you gotta see if you can get enough gas out 
of it to run a 4-cylinder engine :-)


  2. Ground injectors  on
&gt;purpose, and reroute the distributor wire  and let the positive pulses 
from
&gt;the dist. fire them- yes it could be very rich or lean but I bet you 
could
&gt;set the throttle to a constant rpm at a point where it balances the gas 
and
&gt;runs (continuously- and then use the clutch aand gears to limp along!

I think if you tried this the engine would quickly flood out and die.  
Having the injectors held open all the time would result in a terribly 
rich mixture.  In fact, this is one possible failure mode of the ECU, 
holding all the injectors open.  I doubt it would run this way.


  3.
&gt;Another thought was to be able to fiddle with the fuel pressure (make 
it
&gt;very low by clamping the line) and try to balance it with the right air
&gt;intake as above.
&gt;   Any thoughts or other ideas?
&gt;
This might help with the flooding from #2 above.  Would probably take 
more time than it's worth to get it right though! :-)
