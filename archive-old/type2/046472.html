Subject: [T2] Squealing Sound

My 2.0 1978 Bus has developed a sound that is best described as a squealing
fan belt or a giant cricket. Having dismissed the latter for obvious reasons
and then the first by removing the fan belt - the sound persists.
I know this is hard to diagnose by just my description but is this something
any of you recognize as an obvious warning sound?

I replaced a pilot bearing this summer that was worn to the sleeve - no
bearings left. I have been suspicious as to why this would happen and am now
paranoid that it is grinding down the new one. The play in the transmission
shaft was minimal (tiny wobble)  and I didn't check my end play (curses!).

Apart from the noise, performance is good.

Any help appreciated.
