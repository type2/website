Subject: Alternator VS Generator ?
Message-ID: &lt;001d01bf16c8$09aa76e0$d3ef0a3f_at_oemcomputer&gt;

I have both an alternator (3 prong external voltage regulator) and a
generator for my new engine, and I was wondering whats the difference
between the two?  And why There are no more generators out there anymore in
newer vehicles.
The driving force behind this question is that my bus is already wired for a
generator, why try to figure out the alternator electrical?
Thanks Chad
