Subject: Deluxe Micro Middle Seat?

Hello,
        I would like to submit a question to the all knowing and all-powerful
list. I have a 1965 21 Window Deluxe Microbus (non-walkthru) which needs
both a middle and rear seat. I would like to know if a non-walkthru
deluxe ever originally came with the smaller 2/3 seat (that I've seen in
walk-thrus) or ONLY with the full seat with the pivoting back-rest near
the doors. All the old ads I've seen show the nine seat arrangement.
        I just bought the 2/3 middle seat from Dan Kinsey (That VWguy). In the
meantime I am happy to have a seat which fits there.  But if this is not
&quot;correct&quot; I would like to eventually trade the smaller seat for the full
length one. Thanks,
Nathan Dennison
