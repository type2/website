&gt; [...]After removing the bumper, remove the rear valence body panel.
&gt; Then you have a clear path to pull the engine straight out the back, no
&gt; need to jack the bus up at all.  It's way easier than a beetle.

This only works on a 68 to 71 bay.
72 and up has a non-removable valance. [but with a Victor wrench, anything
is removable]
