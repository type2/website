Subject: Re: [T2] why a stumble?

I have another one for you. I had a GEX 1600(yes, I know about GEX)  engine
a few years ago with problems, the flywheel had come loose and the four
dowel holes got all chewed up. They had to tear it down and drill 4 new
holes in the crank. It was then reassembled by an amateur. I bought the
engine like that. It never ran quite right, it kind of missed etc. It bugged
me,  I checked the timing with my timing light, and it jumped around a lot.
Very hard to figure it out. Finally, I noticed that the crankshaft had way
too much end play. This can be checked by grabbing the crankshaft pulley(the
engine pulley with the fanbelt on it) and pulling and pushing it in and out
while watching closely to see if it moves or not. On mine, I had to figure
it out, so I pulled the engine out. I removed the flywheel and the main
seal. Lo and behold, the amateur had forgotten to put the three crankshaft
shims in under the flywheel!!
These are how professionals set the end play up. Since the timing gears are
on a bevel, the in and out movement changes the timing, ergo the ragged
running.  I got 3 shims from another motor, put them in, installed a new
seal, torqued down the flywheel, and it ran perfectly.

I also had to pull the distributor drive gear out and reinstall it
correctly, since the amateur had put it in wrong too. When I was done, this
was a fine, like new engine, it still runs like a top on the trike I sold it
on.

Food for thought.

&gt; Volks,
&gt; Thanks for all the input.
&gt;
&gt; A summary of  what has been suggested;
&gt; 1) vacuum advance not working because total advance should be more like 42
&gt; degrees rather than 28
&gt; 2) advance shouldn't jump around given a steady rpm (which it does)
&gt; 3) check for worn bearings in distributor
&gt; 4) check coil connections (I did and they are all clean and tight)
&gt; 5) replace coil if stutter only happens when hot (which it doesn't, oddly,
it
&gt; seems to be better when fully hot)
&gt;
&gt; More symptoms;
&gt; Idle moves around about 80RPM (+- 40RPM) and stutter in motor correlates
with
&gt; advance jumping around at idle (and at higher RPMs).
&gt;
&gt; Questions;
&gt; Is my stock distributor serviceable (bearings, vacuum unit, etc)?
&gt; Is it better to replace with new? If so, what should I buy? Busdepot has
&gt; 050s  for my year (78, FI, all stock). Is that the best choice? Is that a
&gt; stock replacement?
&gt;
&gt; Again, thanks for the help. It is appreciated very, very much!
&gt;
&gt; Regards
&gt; Chris
