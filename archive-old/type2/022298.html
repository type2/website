I have minor rust damage under my front window could I use the por-15 floor
repair kit there ? I know I would have to cut the fiber glass cloth to fit
..looking to avoid welding

I don't like welding either, because I'm not set up to do it myself. And I 
don't like fiberglass because it has always rusted on me....that it, the 
metal it is bonded to eventually rusts. A body man said this is because 
most fiberglass repairs aren't waterproof.  I did't argue with him, but now 
I use what he uses,,,,epoxy or a waterproof polyester resin. And I am 
experimenting with por-15 in the channels under the big windows along each 
side, at the rear of the bus. They weren't so far gone as the 
below-windshield area.....they still had lots of solid structural metal.

So, because the geometry of that lower windshield lip is so complex, and it 
was so greatly weakened, I  had mine fixed by a professional body man who 
cut out the rusted metal and brazed in some supportive brass material that 
allowed him to fit the windshield and at the same time hold  a bunch of 
fast-hardening polyester resin in the remaining space where the metal came 
out.  Then he ground the polyester down to re-establish the stock 
configuration along the bottom edge of the windshield opening.  The repair 
was about 4 feet long and about 4 inches wide, and probably a half inch 
thick.    I thought the brass supportive material was a good tactic, since 
steel rusts eventually in that location.  The repair is flawless after 5 
years.  Cost me about $300 to get it done, and it saved my 
bus.                        Doyt Echelberger               1976 Westy
