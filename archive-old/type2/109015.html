Subject: Re: [T2] dash vents

From: &lt;Bookwus1_at_aol_dot_com&gt;
&gt; FWIW, I see these dash vent directional inserts (the small round two piece
black plastic affair) all the time when visiting boneyards or VW shows.
There certainly does not seem to be a shortage in supply here in the Pacific
Northwest.

Are most of these in usable condition?  If they're that plentiful, there's
not much reason for me to repro them.  Unless the junkyard ones are not any
better quality-wise than the ones that they're replacing.
