Subject: Re: [T2] Question about normal running oil temperature

&gt; He did not say he was missing the thermostat, he said he was missing the
&gt; thermostat and mechanism. To me that means the flaps are missing, and the
&gt; engine WILL run very hot without that item. You folks can believe what you
&gt; want, but I am telling you the way it is, and will not discuss this subject
&gt; any further. The flaps MUST BE THERE or the engine will overheat.

oh.
i didnt see that. yes i agree especially in the pancake engine that the
flaps are involved in the proper airflow.
