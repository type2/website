&gt;&gt;This is a VERY good question, but in fact, they do.
Which is probably the biggest indicator that there will be
a lot more B.S. coming down the line in the future that
will be detrimental to the mom &amp; pop parts supplier or repair shop&lt;&lt;

does this mean that our list vendors such as Bus Depot, BustedBus &amp;
Bus Boys, Inc.  will soon be coming under fire?

do they also own the words &quot;Transporter, Station Wagon, Kombi,
Beetle, Thing, etc...&quot;?

i can understand them being picky about someone using the letters VW
w/o consent, but the words &quot;bus&quot; &amp; &quot;bug&quot; - thats streching it a little
IMO.
