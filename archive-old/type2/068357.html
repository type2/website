&gt; This question is for all of you who use air tools.  What tools to do find
&gt; most useful.  I believe most of the work performed will be mechanic work
&gt; but I am interest in hearing about everything.  So far I am looking towards
&gt; an impact wrench or a rachet.  What else is there?
&gt; And yes, I have a compressor and tank that should be able to run most air
&gt; tools, I just have no tools yet.

I have a 1/2&quot; and 3/8&quot; air ratchet, a die grinder, a DA, a cut-off tool,
blow-gun and Schraeder air chuck.  I intend to get another die grinder,
so I can have one with a wire-brush and one with a cutting wheel.

What size is your compressor?  What tank size?  Some of these
babies use a lot of air...
