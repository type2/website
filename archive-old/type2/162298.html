Subject: Re: [T2] spark plugs

James,

And every one else....Karl will more than likely agree.

Do *not* *ever* use platinum plugs in your air cooled vehicle!!!

I repeat:

Do.... *not* .....  *ever* use platinum plugs in your air cooled 
vehicle!!!

I guy over on the vintage VW list(much like Karl on our list) used to work 
for Bosch(for many years)....he still drives air cooled VW's.

He said they handed them out to everyone at the factory to try out on 
their cars....they make air cooled hotter than normal and provide no other
benefit.

Now, the caveat may be that *if* you have a super late model type
CDI in your air cooled, with the gaps on the plugs opened up to
50 thou instead of the stock setting, they may help.

Oh, and I have cdi ins several VW's and I still won't use them.

Obviously you are all adults and can experiment with your own equipment.


Cheers, dave
