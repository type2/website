Hi volks,

Please excuse my breach of protocol, but I don't have any other way of doing 
this.  I have changed my email account and do not have any way of accessing 
my p:mail archive files so I don't have any of your email addresses.  I don't 
want to leave those of you that I have been cooresponding with privately (on 
type 2 matters) hanging and wondering why I have not returned your p:mail and 
do not respond to your new mailings.  My old email addresses were 
ahall_at_bafnet.ucla_dot_edu and ahall_at_finance.ucla_dot_edu.  Please do not send any 
more mail to those old addresses.   My new email address, for the time being, 
is ahgrowers_at_aol_dot_com.  Thanks for your time and sorry to bother you if this 
message doesn't relate to you.
