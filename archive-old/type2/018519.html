&gt; is the problem, I did find one post relating to the replacement of the
&gt; sender and the hole cutting issue. Look up &quot;fuel guage sender unit&quot; and it
&gt; will return a post by a guy that claims he got his out without any cutting.
&gt; I haven't tried this but probably will soon.
&gt; 
&gt; Has anyone else been able to replace their sender without any cutting or
&gt; engine removing?
&gt; 

I did, but then again I'm probably that same guy? There's not a whole
lot of room to work with because of the shape of the tank but I found it
a helluva lot easier than butchering my bus with a big hole over the gas
tank.
