Subject: importing Type II's

I'd like to hear from anyone who's had experience importing vehicles into
California.  I'm living in England and playing with the idea of shipping
some nice RHD 23 window buses and early split bugs back to California.  I
know the cost is somewhere between $1000-$1500 to ship.  I want to know what
kind of rules and regulations regarding to smog etc. are involved.  How long
does it take to ship back, what other expenses am I to expect. Is it
possible to fit two beetles in one container etc?

P.S -- There's a guy over here that just found a sweeeeeet 61 23 window
double door bus in Sweeden.  His middle seat has the fold downs on both
sides!  Talk about rare.

Regards,

Brendan
