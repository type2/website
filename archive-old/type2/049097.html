Subject: [T2] Pedal sucked to the floor

I
&gt; have a single progressive Weber with a vacuum port in the manifold, but when
&gt; I connect the booster it sucks the brake pedal to the floor and jams on all
&gt; the brakes.  Anyone got a clue what's causing this and how to remedy it?


Now THATS wierd.

Here's an article on how it all works:

I can't think of how this could be possible without there being either an overly high vacuum on the port (is the engine stock?) or a malfunction in the booster somewhere that has reduced the pressure necessary to apply the brakes (?). I can't see the master cylinder being the issue because your symptoms indicate a working master (the brakes lock up).

Could a malfunctioning or missing check valve cause this?
