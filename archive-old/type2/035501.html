Subject: Testing heater boxes

&lt;when I blew into one end and held my palm over
the other end of the exhaust pipe, it had a big leak in there.&gt;

I am sure this is old hat to most everyone, but can someone explain how to do this test and what to look for.  I have the engine out of the '72 right now, and I'd like to assess the heater box situation.

Thanks to all,
Mike
