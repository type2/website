Subject: Re: [T2] door rubber really tight

Hi Meg,

I went the &quot;el-cheapo*&quot; route and bought Bus Depot's brazilian rubber a 
few years ago for my westfakia. Someday I would like to see a brazilian 
bus door and perhaps then I will understand how it is supposed to 
install. The cross-section of the brazilian seal isn't even close to 
the german seal that  came out of the door. After a few weeks I noticed 
a dent in the door from where I had been repeatedly pushing the door 
shut. Luckily the dent popped out with a bit of help from a suction cup.

After I discovered the dent I knew I had to come up with a better 
solution than just slamming the door harder. The answer I came up with 
was to trim the seal down with a razor blade until it matched the 
proper shape of the door channel. The brazilian seal I got had an extra 
lip that had nowhere to go on my 1979 doors. Once I trimmed that lip 
off I was able to get the door to stay shut without it bouncing open 
again. It's still very snug, but it doesn't leak, either.

The other unfortunate result of using that seal is that my wife now has 
a habit of slamming the unholy $%^&amp; out of the passenger door. Which 
isn't even necessary, as the passenger door still has its original seal 
in good condition. What's a guy to do....

I'd give that seal a close look and see if it is the right shape. If it 
isn't, then your doors will probably be popping open for quite a while.

Happy trails,

*Note: I am not slamming Bus Depot here. *I* am the &quot;El-Cheapo&quot; who 
made the purchasing decision, and I knew that I wasn't getting Original 
German rubber.  If I had wanted to spend extra I could have opted for 
the more expensive part.  From what I've seen, the WCM seals don't fit 
any better, and cost a whole lot more than what BD sells. YMMV.

&gt; Hi,
&gt;
&gt; We put in new door seals (German ones from Bus Depot because they were
&gt; suppose to be the best fit) the door is soooo tight. It closed and when
&gt; you open it, it pops open. I was looking for advice if this is a 
&gt; problem
&gt; or will the rubber relax (lack of better description) with age. Have
&gt; others had this problem and there solutions?
