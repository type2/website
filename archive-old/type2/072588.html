&gt;It's a plate and a ball that goes in between the shifter plate and the
&gt;floor. It shortens the shifter's movement. If you hit the ashtray with your
&gt;kuckels when you shift to first and third this is the thing for you;-)
&gt;
I can second this.  When I bought my '71 Westy, my knuckles did just this
-  they bashed into the ashtray in first and third.  I had previously owned
a '68 which did not do this so I know it's not supposed to be that way.  In
any event, I bought the Berg shifter.  The backward bend of this device is
just what the doctor ordered to keep my knuckles nice and white.
