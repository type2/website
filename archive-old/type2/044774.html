All of those who suggested the temp sensor on cylinder 3 as the 
bucking solution may now sit back and smile.  What had turned
into an intermittant problem occured while idling in my drive way.
I was then able to find it as being the temp sensor after shorting
out the temp input (a fully warmed up signal) and the bus ran
great, then noticed and concluded the sensor was loose.  I tried
tightening it but the hole is stripped out.  I think I'm going to try
and epoxy it in the hole using electrically conductive epoxy.  Any
one have any thoughts on this fix?
