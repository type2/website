Subject: Hyd lifters and solid cam

&gt;It appears that it does not work for
&gt;the people that haven't tried it!!

It seems that perhaps all cams are not created equal.
Just comparing cam duration and lift will not reveal
the difference in Hyd and solid cams. The shape of a
solid cam includes clearance ramps that gently close
the clearance in a solid lifter valve train and only
then quickly begin to open the valve. Since Hyd valve
trains have no slack, these ramps are not necessary.
Using Hyd lifters on a solid cam  will result in
slightly opening the valves way too soon. This gives
you a slight leakage resulting in lower practical
compression pressure and poor performance at low RPM.
The engine will still run pretty good. I put about
10,000 miles on my 914 trying to figure out why it
didn't run the way I thought it should. I had modified
so much stuff on it that I was sure it was improper
timing advance (009), or carb jetting (dual 40mm
Webers), or too radical a cam (Webcam something). I
messed with it seemingly forever until I finally tried
the solids. Wow, the difference was amazing. Then I
had to go back and re do all the stuff I had changed
trying to get my low RPM power back. This was my
experience and perhaps not all cams are ground the
same, but some of us DO try this stuff. Cars are
complicated and anyone who claims to know everything
about them does, in fact, not!
