Hello!

I am adding a couple of accessories to my '74 bus to allow me to do some 
basic camping. I obtained the AC hookup and circuit breaker and would like to 
know where the outside connection gets mounted. I figure it's somewhere about 
the middle on the drivers side. If someone could give me some rough 
dimensions to allow me to accurately place the outside hookup I would really 
appreciate it. Thanks!
