Subject: Re:Gas Cap

Hello Richard,
I was happy to see the cap picture (key).  Just like my 72 bus.  The problem 
is I only have 1 key left.  I keep it in the ash tray.  Last summer my 8 year 
old took it out of the tray and I found it in the back of the bus.  I almost 
ran out of gas, thought I would have to ruin the cap. Anyways, I found it in 
time.  Every time I see a new lock shop I stop in and try to get a key.  My key 
is stamped 218. Do you have a key blank?  Or even one with the same number? 
Thanks,
Dino Spentzos
Newport, RI
