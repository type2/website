Subject: Re: Colors for original Westy upolstery

Colors depend on the years!
The highly attractive yellow in the 66-72(?) is Naugahyde (tm)! I actually
located some of the exact real poop but haven't bothered to buy it.
A). It's expensive
B). It's fugly
C). There wasn't enough to really redo the items typically afflicted with
the baby poop yellow ochre material.
D). The guy selling it was an egotistical rude ***hole.

I will report what the actual Naugahyde catalog number it is if I ever get
back down to the Upholstery place. If there was enough and if the guy was
half way cordial, I probably would have saved the nickels and picked it up.
The color actually looks better and makes &quot;sense&quot; with the freshly redone
wood. The wood kind of takes a little of the &quot;Ugh!&quot; factor out of the
color/colour.
We also located a material that resembles the &quot;Salt and Pepper&quot; grey that
was on the sitting/leaning surfaces of many pre 68 VW buses. It was combined
with &quot;real close&quot; grey vynil for the sides of the seats.
The 68 and newer front seats can be matched easily via the typical catalog
sources.
