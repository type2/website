Subject: Power Outage!!!???

hello all,

i have a question about the electrical system in a 76
westy. specific to the electrical hook up on the
drivers side of the vehicle and the outlet located
beneath the rear seat. 

last nite a buddy of mine and myself were sitting in
my westy conversing and what not. we had an extension
cord running from my house to the electric hookup on
the bus, with a boom box and an electric heater
plugged into the under seat outlet. everything seemed
to be fine, and then, no power. boom box shut off, and
the heater quit running. we checked every connection
between the electric hookup and my house. all tight,
everything plugged into outlet also tight. my buddy
suggested a fuse, any other thoughts or knowledge will
be greatly appreciated. thanks in advance.

Matty
76 Westy &quot;Cleopatra&quot;
