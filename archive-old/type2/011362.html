Oil Leaks.  Oil leak #1- bent pushrod tube. No problem. 
Oil leak #2- Type 4 engine, 1800cc . Take off the fan shroud and on the
left side of the engine, where the oil filter spin-on adaptor attaches to
the block, there are two *holes* (I don't know what else to call them),
each about the size of a dime. It looks like they were filled with
press-in inserts. See the Bently Manual, section 5, page 25 (fig. 9-1)
and page 50 (figs. 15-9 and 15-10). Look at page 50 first, the *holes*
are in the bottom left hand corners of both pictures, and looking at page
25 gives you a good idea where they are in reference to the rest of the
back of the engine. Oil is leaking (quite rapidly) out of the uppermost
hole. I don't know what this is, why it is leaking, and how to fix it.
Somebody, please help. 
Oil leak #3- not sure where it's coming from, but I need to run the
engine to find out. I have both the fan housing and the entire exhaust
manifold off of the bus. Will it hurt my engine to run it like this in my
garage for at most a  few minutes  to find the third oil leak?   
TIA
