Subject: Re: [T2] 1968 Bus

Just a trivial question here( maybe a couple)
Were there one year only parts in the 68?
Reason I ask is I remember a guy lookin' for a front beam at a used parts
place I used to work at and he wouldn't take the 68 beam because he said it
wouldn't fit his 69. We all looked at each other, eyebrows up,
and found him a 69.
Also I have a toy ( it is friday right?) from a VW dealer given to me by my
aunt (80 year old VW person)
telling me she got it when she bought their old bus in the early 70s.
It is a green baywindow, 69ish but on the bottom , along with VW insignia it
is dated 67.
Anybody seen these, is it the model of the bay prototype, worth a fortune?
