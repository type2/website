Subject: Re: [T2] The first dropped valve seat

Hi Dave,

When the engine is cold, oil pressure is supposed to be higher, thus
pushing down the pressure relief spring so that oil bypasses the oil
cooler. Have you checked for proper operation and specs of this
spring?

One of the venders (don't recall which one right off hand) also sells
a tool that recondtions the seat area of this plunger. The description
claims this is a common problem and something that is overlooked even
on reconditioned or new crankcases.

John

&gt; 
&gt; For the first time in my life, I have a t1 engine that is making mayonaise
