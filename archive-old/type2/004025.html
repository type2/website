Subject: Re: [T2] 1700 Cylinder Head Mystery Holes

Sounds like a true &quot;head leak&quot; the stock engines had aluminum, head gaskets,
they blow, and do this nasty deed, there was a VW bulletin that made the
head gaskets a thing of the past, we do not use them, and have no head leak
problems..

Subject: [T2] 1700 Cylinder Head Mystery Holes


&gt; howdee volks,
&gt;
&gt; i purchased a used 1800 head for my 74 westy that turned out to be a 1700
&gt; head.  with a bit of craftiness from a gifted machinist friend it became
an
&gt; 1800.  motor back together and running smoothly it was as loud as a
&gt; helicopter.  valves were readjusted, timing set, no exhaust leaks.  the
&gt; problem discovered was that there are two holes on the head leaking
&gt; combustion pressure. i see short wiffs of flame during firing.  scared to
&gt; run it anymore.  each hole is just to the outside and below the outermost
&gt; intake manifold bolt.  the cowling on either side looks like it shows a
&gt; place for a stud or something.  looking into the hole i believe i see the
&gt; fins of the head along the circumference of the hole and a valve. anyone
&gt; know how to remedy the problem of these mystery holes or what the heck
they
&gt; are?
&gt;
&gt; mystified,
&gt;
&gt; eric
