Subject: need help with rust

This question has probably been answered a million times but... in my 
bus i noticed under the front carpet (by the pedals/front seats) some 
rust (mostly surface). I have been told by a few people to use a zinc 
cro-mat on the rust. I stopped by and called places like Home Depot, 
and several auto parts stores but no one seems to know what I am 
talking about or cant help me with a product that would work. What I 
should use on the rust? Where can I get it?

thanks for all your help.
todd.
