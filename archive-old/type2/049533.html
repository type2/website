Cara,
    Any fabric store should have the foam (3&quot;). When I did the cushions in my 
old Westy, the fabric store I went to was out of the high density stuff, and 
being impatient, I bought the cheap stuff. As I said, it was awful-hard as a 
board! The curtains can be washed as well, it seems to be pretty tough 
fabric.    Jeff S.
