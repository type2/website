&gt; &gt;OK Mountain Folks,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Who has successfully put an altimeter in their bus, and become 
&gt; &gt;pleased with what they bought?
&gt; &gt;If happy, what did you install?
&gt; &gt;Analog - Digital - Model ?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;I'm looking to install one in Casper so I can see how high we go as 
&gt; &gt;we go higher. :-)
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Does not need to have a low level scale for Houston peaks known as overpasses.
&gt; 
&gt; I was thinking of getting GPS. You can altitude from them as well 
&gt; locations, distance travelled and so on. Prices are getting real good 
&gt; for the basic models.
&gt; 
&gt; I spent 21 years as a ship's navigator, I would have loved to have 
&gt; one a GPS.

I have and use a GPS in my bus and it's a lot of fun and very useful.
However, the altimeter isn't all that accurate.  Figure on a couple of
hundred feet each way.

If the arrangement of satellites is particularly poor, I've seen errors of
2000 feet.  Sitting in my driveway, I saw a reading of -1500 feet!  After
a couple more satellites locked on, the error dropped to about 100 feet.
