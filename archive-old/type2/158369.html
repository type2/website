Subject: 78 Bay Max Tow Weight

After the recent Every &quot;wet&quot; Bus event ( not complaining cause I
loved it ), I've decided to get rid of the tent and get a sleepable
trailer.

So, Im trying to find the max tow and tongue weight that I can haul
with my 78 Bay.  Some specs on the bus:

 1978 7 pass transporter (not westy)
 2&quot; receiver
 2 liter EFI with 4500 miles
 mostly stock

Im looking at the obvious Scamp, Casitas and Burros but I'd like
something with a toilet and some kind of shower.  It doesnt have to
be big cause its just for me and my daughter and we cook and &quot;live&quot;
in the screen room anyway.

Thanks in advance,

Dave.
