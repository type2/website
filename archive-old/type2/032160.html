Subject: type 2 and typ2 4 motors
Message-ID: &lt;Pine.SOL.3.96.981204232444.26563A-100000_at_sparky&gt;


I just recently purchased me first type II bus, a Campmobile to be exact.
I am a young person and am very new with these tranporters.  I must say
though I love them  and will always have one.  I heard someone talking
about a
type 4 motor they had installed into there bus.  Pleas excuse me for being
a novice, but what exactly is the difference between a type II motor and a
type 4 and why would someone want to replace the stock motor with a type
II.  Please if anyone could email back on this subject or give me info on
were to look.  Also, if this is not a legitimate type message for this
email service please tell me so I won't error again. 

Thanks all and have a nice day 
:-)
