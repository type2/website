Subject: [F]  Trends Feb 2002,, pg 61 and 38

As it is Friday,

Thanks to Bob for pointing out this coverage of the Canadian Bug out this
summer,, I see that Kenny made the magazine twice!! 
(look on the pages in the subject)
It is quite ironic that &quot;my&quot; kenny was inspired from &quot;MelVan&quot; when I met them at
Buses and Balloons in Alburqurque NM in 99, and that is their 62 camper on page
38! .. 

It is neat getting a picture in the mags!

Cheers!
Jamie Rivers
