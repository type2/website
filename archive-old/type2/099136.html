Yes, but note that 24 on the 8 is 48 on the 4, which is just at the edge 
of spec.
You are okay with this, but 50 is obviously better.

&gt; 
&gt;Timing is set to the notch in the pulley, with 
&gt;the vaccum hooked up. You have been a
&gt; great help to me Mr Dolan and i appereciate 
&gt;you help on this problem that i have.

One thing to consider is that the notch in the pulley may not actually 
reflect top dead center. It may be in your best interest to verify this 
by turning the engine and watching the valves to find the true TDC, or 
by putting a dowl in a sparc plug hole. But then IANSD! (I Am Not Steve
