Subject: charcoal canister hookup

I think a p.o. had the charcoal canister on my 71 hooked up incorrectly 
all this time as I have never looked at the front (hidden) connections 
until now. The following is how I think it should be hooked up - please 
tell me if I am correct:

On the canister, there are two ports facing the firewall. The small port 
should come from the gas tank. The large port should go to the air 
filter. The opposite end of the canister (toward the rear of the car) 
has one large port and comes from the fan shroud.

This is not the way it was hooked up!

Thanks much,
Bill Moon
