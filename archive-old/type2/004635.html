Subject: Re: [T2] Alternator bus vs camper

Pete,

And FWIW, if you're thinking of replacing the standard with the higher
output alternator, don't forget there's a different Volt. Reg to go with it.

(Look at the bus depot catalog for the VW or Bosch parts numbers)

Although I used the one for the higher output with a standard alternator for
two years without any ill effects.   Just changed it when looking for a
charging problem (was something else) and I discovered someone had sold me
the wrong one.   ? Go figure?

&gt; I need to replace to alternator in my 76 camper (dual battery). The
straight
&gt; bus is rated at 55amps I can get a 70 amp at Autozone. Does anyone know
what
&gt; the High output alternator is rated at?
&gt; thanks
