If I tried to put a belt on that was either shorter or fatter it simply
wouldn't fit.  I had to add an extra shim just to get the new production
9.5x905 to work,

I still don't see how an alternator could use a different belt, unless it
also uses a different (smaller) pulley.  Could you explain it to my tired
addled brain (drove 400 miles today in the bus, alternator worked
perfectly
