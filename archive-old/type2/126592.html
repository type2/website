Subject: I just stripped the interior of my 73 Westy...

How can people drive without all the interior stuff? Man is it LOUD!!! heh..

Anyway, I finally ripped the interior out. All the cabinets, seats,
everything. The plywood floor had disintegrated into moldy dust.
Nasty. Virtually all the vertical wood that touched the floor was
rotted and moldy. As expected.

Now that I've seen how everything mounts, I'm skipping installing the
87-ish kitchen. Just not worth the effort to relocate everything since
I don't have a garage to work in. I'll have to weld in brackets and
such for mounting points, and all the extra cutting and welding is
just outside my capabilities for the forseeable future.

I took the now empty bus to a coin car wash to scrub out 30 years of
gunk. That stuff is seriously nasty! The guy that runs the car wash
was just staring at me - first with the soapy brush to scrub it out,
then the high pressure spray to get in the nooks and crannies and
rinse out the now brown soap. I had water and soap spraying all over
the place! He thought I was nuts! LoL!!

Amazingly enough, even before I scrubbed it out the bus smelled 1000%
better. heh That rotted wood was the source of the bulk of the odor.

I'm rebuilding the cabinetry from scratch. No real changes to the
design, just fresh wood. Everything except for the seat/bed cushion
mounts. No mold I can find, so it's just getting a sanding and a
painting. I'll use the old pieces as templates so I don't have to
reinvent the wheel. Well, maybe some minor changes like better cabinet
doors and such.

Has anybody else done something similar? Tips or recommendations?
