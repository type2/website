Subject: Re: [T2] Master Cylinder to Vacuum Booster O-ring - spec and source?

On Mercedes, it is a square o-ring. Should be the same on all ATE masters. I
will try to get the MB number tomorrow.

According to ETKA, the VW part # is 357 611 243

&gt; Between the vacuum booster and the master cylinder there lives an o-ring
&gt; that keeps air from entering at that joint and destroying the vacuum in
&gt; the booster.  When you buy a new/rebuilt MC you *should* get a new one of
&gt; these and usually you do.  If for any reason you have to crack this joint,
&gt; however, you don't have a replacement and I have not had any good luck
&gt; finding them independently. If you don't replace it, then it is likely
&gt; that your vacuum assist will be compromised and you will have a cosntant
&gt; vacuum leak.
&gt;
&gt; Does anyone have the dimensions/a source for this o-ring?
