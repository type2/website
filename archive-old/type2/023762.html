Hi volks,

On Tue, 8 May 2001, John Anderson wrote:
&gt; I'm going to interject in these matters in general, FWIW I've owned
&gt; more buses than most of you have likely, and more Vanagons, and
&gt; a lot of them have come with passenger car tires.  It isn't right, maybe
&gt; they are more likely to fail catastrophically, but I've put a lot of miles
&gt; on a lot of these tires.  Some have failed catastrophically, Sears
&gt; Roadhandler SCR's by Michelin come to mind.  Other are as solid
&gt; 50k on as 6 ply raters (some of the Dunlop SP5s? come to mind.)

 This is a good point, but as George points out:

&gt; After I separated two passenger tires in the space of 100 miles, I saw the
&gt; light and started to insist upon the correct tires.   ...
&gt; If you do _nothing_ but drive around town, you will get by fine with
&gt; passenger tires, but the danger zone is when you take that first highway
&gt; trip after the weather warms up.

 Essentially you are playing the odds. Tyres are generally pretty well
engineered and you will often get away with exceeding their 
specifications significantly.

 I have two comments to make:

 1) The right tyres make driving safer, improving the stability of
    the bus dramatically. You can drive slower, to reduce the risk
    of needing to trust them but it's better to be safe.

 2) Your insurance company may refuse to pay out if you do not have
    the manufacturers specified tyres fitted. They are more likely
    to check when you most need them (ie a big third party claim,
    or perhaps if you are hit by an uninsured drunk and need to 
    make a big medical claim on your own insurance- they can sit 
    by your daughter's hospital bed and claim you would have been 
    able to avoid the other car if you'd had the right rubber...).
    This is similar to running a Porsche on, say, H-rated tyres-
    it shouldn't matter most of the time but when it does, it does.

 Cheers,
	  W.
