The &quot;Michigan&quot; show is a fun venue. It really has grown up over the
years. Ypsilanti's Riverside Park is a very pretty site next to the
Huron river. But I don't think there is camping there. There were a
half dozen (different shades of) Sage Green Westy's there last year.

If you're thinking of attending the Ypsi event, let me know. I know
all the best places.
