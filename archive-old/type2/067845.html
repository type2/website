Subject: Exh Emissions, Part II

Thanks to all who had replied to my plea for help resolving high HC
emissions from my non-Cal 82 Vanagon.

Here's an update:

I have ordered a used x-over pipe and new EGR filter. The New SMOG II
emission control program in California goes into effect in 97', so NOX
emissions will be a concern when I get the Vanagon re-smogged a year or
so from now. I figure it's best to fix it now than to have to come 
back to the &quot;dirty, knuckle-wrenching&quot; exhaust system AGAIN in
such a short time. Besides, I need a functional CO test port on the X-over
pipe to allow measurement of CO levels during adjustment of the air flow
intake sensor. I will also replace the catalytic converter, muffler and
tailpipe. The old cat converter is probably no better than a tin can, and
replacing everything should insure that I've got no &quot;leaks in the system.
At present, I can't see any leaks in the sys, but that doesn't mean they
aren't there (especially in the crevices, metal folds).

Something I didn't mention previuosly, but have since recalled (after
reviewing my notes on my rebuild in 94'). I also replaced the
air intake sensor unit with a new Bosch unit (360 big ones) when I did
the rebuild. After the rebuild, the Vanagon wouldn't not start with the
old unit. With the new unit the VW started and ran fine ... so I never had
the unit properly adjusted. This may be the major contributing factor to
the rich air/fuel mixture. I'll get this done as soon as I get the x-over
pipe installed. According to my manuals, the adjustment requires
real-time CO monitoring via the screw-out test port on the x-over pipe.

Since my Vanagon is a non-California import vehicle (Point of Original
Sale) it does not have an O2 sensor (the sensor stuck in the base of the
Cal cross-over pipe where it connects to the cat converter).

So I'm hoping an adjustment to the air intake sensor, putting on a new
catalytic convertor, and sealing up the system will rectify all my
emission woes.

Will keep you posted on the final outcome.

Incidentally, total projected cost is in the neigborhood of $700 (and I
did shop around for parts ... the non-Cal x-over pipe was a hard one to
find), then another $300 to the state for the previledge of driving this
car in CA (despite passing smog [when I pass!]). Still beats long-term car
payments for a new non-VW, and for a vehicle that I'll likely not be able
to maintain like my cherished one.
