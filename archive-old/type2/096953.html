Subject: springfield mo to  tx??

anyone making this trek any time soon? we are interested in buying some
furniture up in springfield, but it would be pretty pricey to ship - anyone
passing thru who is willing to transport it for us would earn $150!
it's a small dresser, so its not like you can just tuck it under the seat
and ignore it. don't ruin your vacation on acoount of us :)

pmail me if this sounds feasible.......
