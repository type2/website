Subject: Re: [T2] Best Way to Restore Wheels

&lt;&lt;Well, I generally think that's right. But that's why the prices of our
buses are sort of stuck at $4000 at the high end. 

Depends on where your doing your shopping , and what your looking at.

I just witnessed a 78 Champaign Edition sell for $14,750.00.
 
Anyway, it's worth pointing out that on this list, &quot;restore&quot; means
anything from careful sanding and original paint codes to duct tape.
That, for better or for worse, sets us apart. 

Your right about this Mark.

One's guy's idea of correct is not necessarily the same as another's.

But in this case of powder coating the wheels I would have to say that
this is a lesser of many other evil approaches to getting the job done
right. 

Power coating the wheels is small apples to spray can priming, &amp;
painting the whole Bus .( for example )

The benefit to the end result of using this process outweigh's it's
correctness.
