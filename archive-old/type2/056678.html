&gt;&gt;,,,so i pass on the SIPING.  anybody had their tires SIPEd? &lt;&lt;

Tire siping has been around for at least 45 years, to my personal knowledge.

Back in the early 1950s I worked at a large OK Rubber Welders tire store.  OK 
Rubber Welders was a franchise operation, and they had their own very high 
quality, patented, siping and truing equipment.

Back then the compounds used in new and retreaded tires were quite hard, and 
the siping process greatly improved their wet weather adhesion.

In those pre-radial tire days (they were available in Europe, but extremely 
rare in the USA) even brand new tires were usually significantly out of round. 
 Although truing the tires removed a fair amount of tread rubber, tire life 
was actually enhanced because the trued tires ran so much smoother and cooler. 
 It was common to find &quot;high spots&quot;, even on expensive premium tires, that 
required removal of over 1/4&quot; of tread rubber. 

We always had a long waiting list for siping and truing services and kept two 
machines and operators going full time.  The majority of services were for new 
car dealers that would bring in vehicles for tire truing prior to delivery to 
customers.  Our biggest client, by far, was the local Cadillac dealer.  Every 
car they sold, new or used, had it's tires trued on our machines before 
delivery.

We also had a large number of customers that were sent to us by Firestone, 
Goodyear, etc., dealers so the customer's newly mounted set of tires could be 
trued on our equipment.

Tire manufacturing technology has improved tremendously over the past 4 
decades, but you might be surprised how many tires are still out of round when 
mounted and inflated to working pressure.  A lot of tires perceived as &quot;out of 
balance&quot;, or &quot;incapable of being properly balanced&quot;, are simply out of round.
