Subject: Re: [T2] Pancake Virgin (spark plug removal/install in 72)

In a 72 you cannot look down at the top of the engine because of the
lack of an access panel.....the trick here is to put a socket and a long
extension (at least six inches) on the seated plug and NOTE WHERE THE
TIP TOUCHES THE COMPARTMENT CEILING- and MARK the end of the extension
location on the roof.   This gives you a reference &quot;angle&quot; for
reinstalling the plug so you can locate the hole as you blindly lower
the plug/extension. I get no crossthreading this way on the difficult #2
plug.
Take a plain plug socket and glue a circle of foam (like that lining
jewelrey boxes) into it so it will not let the plug drop.  The last
parter engine I just dismantled had the plug, socket, and a short
extension rooled into the corner!  I use LOCKING extensions and ratchets
so it cannot separate.
   When I had to fish a plug out of a friend's engine, we used a dental
mirror and a flashlight at night to figure out what corner the plug was
in.  Then, take a semicircle of old speaker magnet that has 12 gauge
copper house wire wrapped and glued to the end.  This can be bent easily
to fish for the plug.
