Hi all
My 74 type 4 engine has developed a crack in the tubes that go into the
head, from the air pump.
The 1-2 side has 1 tube in each cylinder, the 3-4 side has only 1 tube .

As the pump is long gone and the cracks now leak exhaust into the engine
bay,, I wanted to repair them.
I was told to just pinch them off as they are not needed

I wondered if anyone could comfirm this,,
Are those tubes really needed for anything, ?
Will it be detrimental to the fuel mixture or anything?
Thanks
