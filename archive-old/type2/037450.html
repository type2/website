Subject: Electronics question

Hey all you electronics wizards out there:  I want to monitor the resitance of 
my head temp sensor while driving (this is on Bosch d-jet FI, but I think the l-
jet FI uses them too).  The head temp sensor, when cold reads about 2400 OHMs 
and when very hot drops into the 100's level.  I need to be able to monitor the 
readings during the entire warm-up cycle.

So, my question is, can I run a 12 foot wire from the sensor, up to the front 
of my bus, to my digital multimeter (set for OHMs of course) and then run 
another wire from the meter 12 feet back to the motor to the FI wiring 
harness.  Will the multimeter interrupt or alter the resistance?  Will the 24 
feet of wire have any appreciable effect on the resistance?  Is this even 
possible (ie. with one lead connected to the FI harness and the other to the 
sensor will I be able to get a resistance reading at all)?

Thanks!!
