Subject: Re: MPG and miscalculations?

Chris and Kellie,
I to have a '75 FI, but with a Westfalia pop-top on it. I consistently get 
right around 20 mpg on the highway on long trips, running at about 60 mph. 
So with a 14.8 gal capacity tank, I figure if it was up to the neck I could 
go about 290 miles.
More important is to know how much gas you have when the guage is nearing 
empty, so you can figure whether you'll make it to the next service station. 
So run it down to the very last white hashmark (in town or with some extra 
gas in a can aboard in case tha guage is optomistic) and then see how much 
it takes to fill it. Compare to 14.8: the difference times 20 is how much 
further you can go before you are running on fumes at that point on the 
gauge. I have about 1.2 gal at that reading, and I haven't run out of gas 
yet using that approach. My wife still has a conniption when I take it that 
low, however.
