Update on an old list message...

I found the number tucked away on my distributor and it's standard:

VW 021-905-205P, Bosch 0231 168 005

I still can't figure out what the black box is that I identified below or
why the 271 condenser was there in the first place.

&gt;&gt; What's the difference between a 1 237 330 252 (02074) condenser
&gt;&gt; and a 1 237 330 271?  I have a &quot;252&quot; in my tune-up kit but what I
&gt;&gt; pulled off my bus was the 271.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Searching the archives I can't figure out which one is correct
&gt;&gt; for my year.

What was unusual was that instead of connecting the green wire directly to
the coil, it connected to a black box that is inline with terminal 1 on the
coil. 211 035 257.

Can someone help me identify the two item in this picture that might lead to
identifying the correct condenser.
