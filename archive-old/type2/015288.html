Hello All:
The time for my first extended adventure in my bus has come.
I am planning to point it towards Memphis to meet up with some friends
and await the arrival of a FedEx package and then we are all hitting
the road for Kansas then back to Tennesse and home to Alabama.
Depending on home the bus handles that ~1600 journey will determine
whether or not it gets to go with us for the rest of the July trip.
(another 4500+miles)

The Trip:

June 27  Birmingham,AL to Memphis,TN       (hwy 78)
June 29  Memphis to KansasCity,KS          (I-55, 64, 70)
July 1   KansasCity to Nashville,TN        (I-70, 64, 57, 24)
July 2   Nashville to Birmingham,AL        (I-65)

I'll be home for a night and will then decide if I think I should
take the bus on the rest of the journey.... which is:

July 3   Birmingham to Atlanta, GA         (I-20)
July 5   Atlanta to Macon, GA              (I-75)
July 6   Macon to Charlotte,NC             (I-75, 85)
July 8   Charlotte to VirginiaBeach,VA     (I-85, hwy 58)
July 9   VirginiaBeach to Columbia,MD      (I-64, 95)
July 10  Columbia to Camden,NJ             (I-95)
July 11  Camden to Mansfield, MA           (I-95)
July 14  Mansfield to Holmdel,NJ           (I-95, GS Pkwy)
July 16  Holmdel to Oswego,NY              (GS Pkwy,a,b,c,d, I-81)
July 19  Oswego to Toronto,Canada          (think bus will stay in USA)
July 21  Toronto to Pittsburgh, PA         (I-90, 79)
July 22  Pittsburgh to Columbus, OH        (I-70)
July 24  Columbus to Milwaukee,WI          (I-70, 65, 80/90, 94)
July 25  Milwaukee to Indianapolis,IN      (I-94, 65)
July 27  Indianapolis to Birmingham, AL    (I-65)


As you can see, the city to city hopping doesnt leave a lot of time
in each place. But, that's the way the tour travels.....

I've been on the list for 2.5yrs and haven't had the chance to meet
a single list member in person, hopefully that will change in the 
course of this trip. For dinner or a beer/conversation/etc... and NOT
because I ran into mechanical problems and got stranded. However, it
would be reassuring to know that there are folks I could contact should
I find myself in need of assistance.

I'm confident my bus will make the trip without incident, but with it
being my first extended adventure in any bus, am I skeptical. I'm
packing many spare parts (FI mostly) and odds and ends from two donor
busses that are not going to be driven during the month of July. In hopes
that my having them will result in me not needing them :-)

If I was to become stranded I will not have access to the internet.
Although, friends that will be traveling the same route &amp; that I will be
staying with, several do have laptops, which would allow me to access
the archives/list/etc... if I was still mobile and but needing repair.
If anyone along my route would be interested in possibly meeting for a
beer, bustalk, etc.... &amp;/or would be willing to be contacted directly
if I did encounter problems while passing thru your area and needed to
find a partsplace/junkyard/etc... I'd love to hear from you.

Also, if anyone on the list is going phishing this summer, do get in touch.
I'll be taping the whole tour and can provide tapes :)

thanks for being here!
Rob
