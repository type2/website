&gt;The crazy (but polite) car pool twosome passed on offers of breakfast and
&gt;coffee and took off in Dave's &quot;DaBoat&quot; Safare camper into the early morining
&gt;with fresh directions to local Phoenix junkyards in hand... Whew~!
&gt;Thanks for stopping guys!

The last I saw of these guys was in Mammoth Lakes, CA *yesterday* 
afternoon at 1:30PM (PST). I think that Unca' Joel had a strange craving 
for Carl's Jr. Western Bacon Deluxe Burger. That must've been what fueled 
him all the way to your place. ;-) It was great to have met both of 'em!
