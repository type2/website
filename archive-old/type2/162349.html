Subject: Re: [T2] Oil Temp Gauge Query

&gt; I have a VDO oil temp gauge here that I am interested in installing
&gt; before I go to EveryBus.  There are three wires going into the gauge;
&gt; one is marked as ground, one with a &quot;+&quot; and  one with a G.
&gt;
&gt; Am I correct in assuming this is a powered gauge? I kinda expected it
&gt; would have had a self-powered thermistor like the CHT does.
&gt;
&gt; And finally: Does this gauge care how much wire is between it and the
&gt; sender?

if it is like mine the extra wire is for the instrument light, should be
hooked in with the other instrument lights. I tapped into one of the
lightbulb wires behind the dash.

you have G(round)   +   and  lightbulb.

I have never read anything about the VDO guage having a problem with long
wire runs.
