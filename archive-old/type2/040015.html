Subject: my method for removing stubbborn oil filters-

Nikki, et al-
    You do just hand tighten the filter, yes?  For stubborn filters, try
this method-no need to remove tin.   get a piece of 2x4 about 1 foot
long.  measure the diameter of your filter and reduce it by 1 inch, and
drill a minimum of 2  1/8 or 3/32&quot; holes representing this spacing into
the
board.  Whack in a 10 penny nail into each hole so you have nice sharp,
long points sticking out.  (The drilling is so the wood doesn't split)
Hammer this into the bottom of the filter and
crank out the _at_(#_at_$#*^% thing!  If you have clearance problems with tin,
then add a spacer of some kind so the board doesn't seat up all the
way.  Careful of oil drippage.
