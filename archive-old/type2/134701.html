Subject: Re: [T2] towin a bus with a Pontiac 6000

One things for sure, if you have some kind of accident in a rental truck
while hauling a vehicle inside the box you better have deep pockets because
any sane rental agreement forbids transporting vehicles inside of a box
truck...

Besides if your already renting a big truck how much more is it to rent a
flatbed transport trailer to go behind it? I know Ryder rents flatbed
trailers, not sure who else.

&gt; i have known people that have rented big enough box trucks for not much
more than a tow dolly and drove the bus up in it and towed it that away....
&gt; i dont know what uhaul they went to though i havent ever seen a way this
could be done?
