I can kinda agree with him on the part that the engine is hard to =
access,
for the fact that it doesn't have the top access as the 73 and up have =
, yes
its kinda a pain but in no way impossible!
just my thought

Subject: [T2] Woe is me.


So I am happily shopping for stuff at my favorite local dealer today. I
picked up some door handles and other broken stuff for my new baby.  =
When
the shop owner informs me that his mechanic refuses to work on my =
particular
year of westy.  And he proceeded to list the following &quot;known&quot; =
problems:

1. Throttle linkage wears out and creates a vaccuum leak on the dual =
carbs.

2. The engine is hard to access and therefore work on.

His main bone of contention seemed to be the carb situation. He seems =
to
dislike the dual carbs with a passion. Maybe they stomped on his flower =
bed
in a previous life. But anyway, I am a little disheartened, how big of =
a
deal is this? Opinions ideas? :-(

Question #2, exhaust leak near the head on the driver's side. It =
doesn=B9t
look like its the head itself so I suspect the heat exchanger is =
cracked.
The question is, can this be done engine in the bus or do I need to =
yank it

And an update:

To those whose had suggestions for the shifter and no reverse, thank =
you!
The shifter plate was out of adjustment and now everything is =
hunky-dory.

Thanks.
