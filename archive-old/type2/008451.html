I have become the owner of a set of allmost complete stock vw 34 
non-smog carbs. These carbs came of a bus from el salvador. i want the 
go back to a stock type setup with my 2.0. I sure some one on the list 
has done this. I got some jet sizes out of the haynes, but would trust 
someone who has run this set up more. If someone has done this i would 
also like to know what kind of dizzy you ran with it. I my bus limited 
experience, most people say the the weber 34 ict are too small for a 
2.0. with this in mind would the stock 34 be too small? I am running a 
progresive kit and it runs...well I will not get in to that. any info 
would be great. thanks

65 standard for sale
78 double cab (soon to be)
