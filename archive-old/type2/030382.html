Volks, 

I know that this is a great fantasy, but please don't go there!

The list covers all air cooled buses, and because it is world wide, and
air cooled buses are still made, and some countries still allow import
(notably Great Britian), there are list members who own brand new air
cooled buses.  For them, discussion of these buses is allowed, but
discouraged.  For listees in the United States and Canada.... PLEASE
DON'T GO THERE!!  

It is not possible to legally import a Brazilian or South African air-
cooled bus into the United States or Canada and discussion is futile.
