Rich -

Congratulations on a job well done raising your daughter, and future
son-in-law. They made a fine choice. Hopefully, other choices they will need
to make will be this practical, dependable, unspoiled, and straight forward.

I think they're just positioning for you to give 'em the bus. Be careful.
Can't trust those young 'uns!
