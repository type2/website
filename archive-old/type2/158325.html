Subject: Re: [T2] 2000CC Longblock

My Boston Bob longblock just went into my bus and it runs like a top.  
Beautiful sound, no leaks and pulls strong. It was really well packed  
and shipped.
Yes this does mean my Safare is back on the road.
I bought it on the recommendations of the list  and I went with a 2L.

Steve

&gt;   If I wanted to buy a &quot;crate&quot; longblock, preferably an 1800 or larger
&gt; motor, where would I go? I have a GEX motor right now, and I'd  
&gt; swear that I'm
&gt; going to lose a lobe on my cam.
