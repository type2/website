&lt;&lt; We should constantly remind ourselves that these are old vehicles with a
limited parts demand.  We rely on small(er) suppliers to fill our needs.
Along with this comes the fact that small businesses today are running on
shoestrings that are thinner and more delicate than before.  I don't know
Mr. Salmon's specific situation but I'm fairly certain that his business is
no different from any other.

Cut him some slack, Jack. &gt;&gt;

I've got a couple of other 'orphan' cars (Little British Cars), as well as 
'semi-orphaned' VW's...I'm sure others on the list do too (as does Mr.
Salmon...) If you think it's as easy keeping an old car up and running as
a VW, you've got another think coming...
