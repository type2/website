Subject: RE: [T2] Rust Converter's Results and Finding's.

&gt;From: Terry K'&quot; Second, --hey--after you sand blast, wire wheel, or sand 
&gt;off
&gt;the rust---how in the heck does the pot holes get filled?
&gt;The rust converter isn't a high fill item--so the pot holes
&gt;won't get filled --- You can't spot putty or lay a light coat
&gt;of Bondo on them --the Bondo won't stick to the rust
&gt;converter--and the rust converter is made to bond / react to
&gt;the rusty metal-- a no win situation so the pot holes
&gt;stay--

Take your pick they all say they stick.

TravelOn,

Michael Knight
