&gt; I saw one in person last year. Since the rubber isn't made anymore, and 30
&gt; year old tire rubber is worse than useless, it's just for novelty now.

They did indeed fold in on themselves to take up less room.  However, it
was one of the dumber ideas, since it resulted in a nearly irreplacable
tire that was probably dangerous to use within a decade.  Some US cars
also had them, but with a can of freon for inflation instead of an
electric pump.

Modern &quot;donuts&quot; a somewhat better idea, but still not for those of us who
take long trips.  Heck, with the odd tire size I carry two spares on
trips!

I wonder why the idea of under-floor storage was never explored for buses?
the center heat duct would have to be relocated, but then there would be
plenty of space for a spare under there.
