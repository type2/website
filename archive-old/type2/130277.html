Subject: RE: [T2] Can't get it off!

A good friend told me a story of getting POR-15 on his hands and then working at a Pizza Hut. Everyone thought he had dirty hands and was handling their food... 

By the way - dunno what happened but his POR-15 did nto stop some window opening rust. He had to sand it back off. Dunno if it was a prep problem or the stuff. 

Chris
