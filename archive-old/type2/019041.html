Re the person hitting a deer with the bus:
FWIW, does she have &quot;comprehensive&quot; coverage on the bus?  Few of us know
you can have comprehensive and NOT collision (get mine thru Good
Sam)...., which many don't want because the bus may not be worth the
cost and companies may balk beyond a certain age.  Comprehensive covers
damage incurred such as a tree falling on bus, or a hit-and-run dent in
a parking lot.  It also covers you hitting a deer- and of note, your
rates will NOT go up due to comprehensive claims!  Oddly, you have a
collision claim when you run into a tree avoiding a deer- and a
comprehensive claim plowing into it.....so with me who has no collision
coverage, the moral is DON'T SWERVE and run into a tree!
