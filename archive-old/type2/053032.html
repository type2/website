Subject: piston/rod question

hey volks,
well i spent most of this morning cleaning up my tin
since the engine is out and then decided to remove the
#1 piston.   came out pretty easy and was checking
play in the rod.   there is no play when pushing
pulling on it, but slight side to side movement.   its
been a while since ive played with a motors insides so
is this ok, i would assume slight side to side
movement would be ok as long as there is no in out
play.   another thing, since i am needing to replace
my pistons, looks like bus depot will be getting some
of my HEM (hard earned money) i see all that is
available is Brazilian pistons, are these good
quality?   just curious.
thanks evrybody,
shelby
