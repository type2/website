Subject: Valve Adjustment questions

Hello!  
I am a newbie to the list, (and to VW's in general) and need a bit of
assistance.  I did read through the archives, and through the FAQ's and
HOWTO's on the website, but didn't find much help.

First off, I have a '77 Bus. I am adjusting the valves for the first time,
and things are not going well...
I've been using the Muir book as my guide.  Also, I'm not to mechanically
inclined... :-)

Q1)  When I rotate #1 to TDC, my distributor cap does NOT point to the
little notch in the rim.  It DOES point to the #1 plug.  Should I ignore the
notch?  Why would it not match...?

Q2)  What (imagined horrible thing) will happen if I didn't adjust them
properly.  Being this is my first time w/ a feeler gauge, I'm kinda shooting
from the hip.  I just want to know what kind of damage I could cause if I'm
careless.

Q3)  Do the valve adjustments get tighter, or looser or both?  I noticed
that all mine we're quite tight before I adjusted them.  I expected them to
be looser, not tighter...

Q4)  The lock nuts that were there we're impossible to get up and down the
set screw.  I replaced them all with 8mm full height nuts.  Should I think
about ordering new nuts, or will these work?

Thanks!

The Paranoid Tinkerer,
Marcus
