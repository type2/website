Subject: brand new air flow meter!!!

gang,

so i still have this brand new air flow meter. perhaps
some of you remember the story i unfolded before.
either way, its a  part # 410012 or 0 280 200 012. it
fits buses w/manufacture dates from 8/74 to 12/75. i
would like to get 100 dollars. but i can be reasoned
with. i really just wanna get it outta here!
