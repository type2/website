Subject: Ebay posts


Folks, if you read your charters, the type2 list does not welcome ebay
posts.  I have seen two of them this morning alone.

This was decided after some listees posted excessive Ebay ads to the list.

If you want to sell your stuff here, that's fine, but don't use the type2
list to advertise your Ebay listings.
