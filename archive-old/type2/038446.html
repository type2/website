Subject: '69 electrical q's....

All,

I finally pulled my guage panel to install the VDO
tach that I bought (two years ago!) and decided to
replace all of the dash lights while I was in there
(several were burned-out).

I went to the FLAPS and bought all new bulbs (the new
ones were a little larger in dia., but otherwise
identical) and installed them. So, I fire up the bus
to see the results, and.... no high-beam indicator, or
parking light indicator:-(

Now, these were working before (further proof that if
it ain't broke, don't fix it!), but not now. I have
checked and re-checked pretty much everything, but to
no avail. 

And before anyone asks, I replaced them because I was
already in there, and didn't want to have to do it
again anytime soon.


Also, while I was in there, I noticed two severed
wires inside the dash and I have no idea where they go
(PO's *really* suck).

They were:
1. A black wire (original, too) that was attached to
the headlight switch.
2. Another black wire that was attached to the
fuse-block (fuse furthest from the door).

Both of these appear to be original equipment (same
connectors, type of wire, etc), but I can't find a
referrence to either in my Bentley's wiring diagram.


Any help on any of these would be greatly appreciated!
