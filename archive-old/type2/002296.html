Subject: front shock bolts

Hello list,

Its been a long while since I have posted a message (and many thanks to Den
in Ontario who helped me out with a used tranny then!)

I have just acquired another bus and I have been madly working away on it to
get it to a 'fresh' start in my books.  This so far has meant new shocks,
cv's serviced, tranny oil changed, oil change and much more to come.

In replacing the front shocks I had a really PITA bolt/nut duo that decided
to sacrifice their lives to the job as I had to gind the bolt off.  I
ordered two 'shock bolts' from Parts VW (which is local for me) and found
that they would work but only with a bit of modification to the set up.

The original bolts/nut set up had Bolt head/shock/spacer (about
1-1.5mm)/front end pass through/nut.

With the new bolt it will work if I remove the spacer.   The bolts were from
Bugpack.  I have two questions.

1) Is the spacer needed?

2) Is the bugpack bolt strong enough not to shear?  My FLAPS (Bowwow-
blantant plug) said I needed a grade 10 bolt but I don't know if Bugpack is
that grade.

I have it installed with two new bolts now (with one old one waiting for an
answer) but I need to reassure myself if nothing else.

On the plus side I installed Gas adjusts all around and I like the ride
(though the front end rides high now).

Thanks all!
