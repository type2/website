Subject: Re: [T2] Pop-Top Canvas Replacement

&gt;I have a 1971 Riviera conversion pop-top camper. The canvas needs work. It's
&gt;not actually canvas, but some sort of yellow plastic thing. The screens need
&gt;some work and the zipper to access the roof top cargo area is broken. I'm
&gt;thinking of either replacing this or at the very least taking it off and
&gt;fixing the problems.
&gt;
&gt;Has anyone done this? How hard is this thing to get off? Does anyone know of
&gt;a good source for this item if I decide the old one is beyond repair?

Id say just replace the whole thing, I got one for my 79 from 
busdepot_dot_com. The instructions come with it on how to install, I 
havent installed it yet but from what I hear its painless. just got 
to make sure its tight.

this might be it:
