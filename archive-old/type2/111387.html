Subject: Re: [T2] Paint Removal

Tks for the advice.  Since the bus is trapped inside
my garage since the springs on the door have broken. 
I probally won't be able to get a hose in there but
may try just a bucket of water and a rag since I
assume the water is used to neturalize the agent.  The
stripper did work great on one door but it was off a
doner car.  I'll also try the plastic wrap since it
appears that the spray is drying faster than normal.

Tks again, I'll let you know the progress

Stan

&gt; well i myself was haveing the same problems trying
&gt; to get through several layers of spray paint..
&gt; 
&gt; my wife bought me some furniture stripper from wal
&gt; mart ..
&gt; its in a white can with gold on it.. 
&gt; 
&gt; works extremely well..
&gt; 
&gt; first turn on the water hose..
&gt; 
&gt; then put on some rubber gloves...
&gt; then spry it on and get out your putty knife.. after
&gt; spraying it on wait about 1 minute and start
&gt; scrapeing with putty knife i promise it will come
&gt; off like gooooo like water..
