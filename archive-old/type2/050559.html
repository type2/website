&gt; Was wondering if those who have replaced their points with an electronic ignition would care to comment on the process and proformance after the installation.  I have had some problems recently with my points (you know if I just bought a new set instead of filing away on them) and was curious.  New points are $2.00 to $3.00, electronic ignition kits are $65.00+, is it worth the additional cost.  

I think so, mine are Pertronix, fairly straightforward to install
read the directions
