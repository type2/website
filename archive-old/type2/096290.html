Subject: Looking for SF Bay Area VW locksmith

Hi All,

Does anyone know of a good SF Bay Area locksmith for re-keying an ignition
lock? I've called about 6 places so far, with very little success. If
you've had prior experience with them, that makes 'em even better. East
Bay is preferable.

I've already pulled the engine lid lock and had a key made for it, but
it didn't work in the ignition. So, I'm a bit hesitant to pull the door 
lock. I'd prefer not to pull the ignition just to get it re-keyed. I'd
like someone to come on site, and make me a key directly for the
ignition. If you know someone who might fill the bill, please let me know.

thanks!

Bren
