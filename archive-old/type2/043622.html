Well, IMHO, it's like this...

How long did it take you to figure out that your FI bus would not start
because one of the big hoses was off the decel valve? Or that you had
forgotten to plug in the AFM?  There are a million things that you can
disconnect inside the engine compartment that will discourage the
joy-rider.

OTOH, we stripped a bus.  We took the front axle beam and the rear torsion
bars.  That bus was sitting on cinder blocks, with no wheels and no axles
(and not much of anything else... we hate sending useful bits to the
crusher :-)  When the time came and we called the scrap hauler, it took
him less than 5 minutes to load and leave.

To discourage joy-riders, pretty nearly anything will do it.  If you want 
to discourage professional thieves who are fixated on your bus, pretty
much nothing will stop them.  A good, solid garage... *maybe*.
