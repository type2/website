&gt; Hi I'm new here, but I have a number of brochures dating from the 1970's for
&gt; Devon Conversions a British Company. In them, they state that the 1600cc
&gt; engine came as standard and the 2000cc engine was the optional extra.
&gt;
&gt; An 1976 example of cost:-

&gt; and the Automatic 2000cc option #282.21.
&gt; These had to ordered from the factory (i.e. VW via Devon ) before conversion
&gt; could take place.

THIS is interesting, I have always been told that the Automatic was only
avaliable in the USA and Canada...  have you actually seen an Automatic in
Europe????    wonder how many were sold????
