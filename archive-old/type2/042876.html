yes. but they are supposed to snap open to the &quot;coolest&quot; position if the

at top right side of engine just in front of the cooling blower there
should be a rod with a little lever on it. move that lever if it springs
back then your probably in full open position.  we are talking a rod that
runs into the black tin and runs most of the width of the engine, about
1/4 inch. the lever is actually the clamp for the cable from the
thermostat and is maybe an inch long.

&gt; great, Muir's book barely touches it. I'm stuck in Crested Butte, CO and 

Muir doesn't really touch the type 4 engine 

&gt; these high temps are making me quite nervous. Great place to be stuck... 

you have good reason to be nervous, I am sure you will get responsess
about the distributor and the engine compartment seal.  also don't forget
that at 8,000 ft the engine works harder, drive easy
 Crested Butte is beautiful but not a place to be stuck in.
