Subject: Re: [T2] Things I LOVE About Driving a Bus!

 I'd have to put my favorite on the list:

Passing people on the highway.

Going downhill at 70 when the rest of traffic is going 60, I love passing
people.  They get a puzzled (and sometimes annoyed) look like: &quot;Is that VW
Bus actually passing me?&quot;  It's even better if they maintain their speed and
don't speed up so I can't get back into the travel lane...

I agree with the snow driving, the handbrake turns, and coming close to
anything with the front end.  These sure are fun vehicles!


see this one?   - steve
