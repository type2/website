Subject: RE: [T2] Battery or Connection Problem?

Thanks to all who responded to this.  You were all correct - I pulled out
the battery, removed both cables, and cleaned ALL of the connections really
good with sandpaper.  Put it all back together and Presto!  Bus fired right
up.  Didn't even have to put it back on the charger.

I believe the problem area was actually where the positive cable was
attached to the clamp that goes on the battery post.  I replaced the rotted
(original?) ones 10 years ago with the kind that sandwich the cables with a
metal plate.  I've cleaned the ground cable-to-chassis and the
cable-to-battery connections several times over the years, but this is the
first time I've re-opened the sandwiches on the clamps themselves.  Probably
just my imagination (and I don't have a gauge to verify), but my lights
seemed brighter this morning.

Thanks again.

73 Westy
Colorado Springs, CO

&gt; I had my 73 Westy on the 2amp charger yesterday for about 14 hours
&gt; yesterday because it wouldn't start a few days ago.  This morning I 
&gt; went to start it.
&gt;
&gt; I turn the key on/off a couple of times to prime the fuel pump (D-Jet FI
&gt; system).  The interior light was on and looked fine, and I heard the fuel
&gt; pump spin nicely.  When I turn the key to the &quot;start&quot; position, the gauges
&gt; IMMEDIATELY went dead and I had absolutely NO power to anything.  The
&gt; starter never turned over at all.
&gt;
&gt; Does this sound like a complete shot battery or some other malady?  I
&gt; checked the connections at the battery and they were OK.  Any suggestions
&gt; greatly appreciated.
