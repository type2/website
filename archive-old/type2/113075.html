Subject: Re: [T2] starter solenoid

Yeah, there is an aux starter switch. On the old solenoid there were two 
male connecters together and another one apart from them. The aux switch 
was wired into the double male connecter. The new solenoid has the 
double male connecter but the other is missing.

Do you have a aux starter switch set up on your bus,
that wire might be for it, that wire normaly
piggybacks on one of the other wires. Phil
