Subject: Bouncing Baby Bus!!!!

Hi all!

Just wanted to thank everyone who helped me with information, tips, e-mails,
phone calls, etc. on buying a bus (especially Barry- you're the best!!!).  I
am now the proud owner of a 1970 bouncing baby bus (Hah- he's older than I
am, and I'm not that young!!).  Will be picking him up on Saturday, and I'm
thinking of naming him HAL (&quot;open the bus bay door HAL&quot;), although in the
end that might be too malevolent for such a sweet little old bus. He's only
got 8,000 miles on a rebuilt engine and drives just as nice as possible.
Everyone was right about the karma thing too, he is the right bus for me-
easy to work on, inexpensive parts- can't believe my luck!

Thanks again everyone!!

Take a look at him here:
