Make sure you follow the instructions in your manual for putting them back
together.  They go together very easy &amp; very wrong.  Only on new ones should
you have this tightness.  I just went through this with my 79.  I had one of
them put together wrong &amp; they would not pivot.  There is a good picture in
the Muir's idiot book about the relationship of the balls, inner &amp; outer
hub.  Take your time here.
