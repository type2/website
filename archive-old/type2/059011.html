Subject: Campmobile Sink/Fridge pedestal to identify

[This message was posted by a non-subscriber. Please reply to the

I recently trashpicked a sink/fridge pedestal from a Westy.
It has the &quot;Campmobile&quot; sticker right on it, and looks just like the
ones in some Westies.

Two things I need to know: What years does it match, and what is it
worth to sell or trade?  There are parts I'd rather have for my '67
Kombi, and besides this looks like it came from a late-70's model.

It has a tan wood finish, gray plastic handles, and a light-gray
cloth-pattern laminate top (except for the stainless-steel sink bowl).
There's a countertop leaf that folds up over the sink, and some spice-rack
size shelves on the right side.  There's a propane regulator and hose
going into the fridge.  The sink has its faucet, but no sign of a pump,
though the big plastic water tank is visible behind the unit.  A black
plastic drain pipe extends from the sink drain to about 6&quot; past the
bottom of the cabinet.  There was another pipe with it that seems to be
a vent for the drain.

Is there anywhere I can look for a date or part number that identifies it?

It's near Boston, MA.  Things I'd rather have include a center seat, and
a gas heater.  Anyone interested in a swap?

Please reply to me, and I'll summarize to the list(s).

thanks!
