&gt; Just another .02 worth. Had a friend with a fairly aggressive cam grind
&gt; and the available vacuum was a little slow coming with all the valve
&gt; overlap. When he had to sit at a red light, the brake peddle would get hard
&gt; and lose assist.
&gt;   We installed a &quot;Vacuum reservoir canister&quot; in line (ala 1950s style
&gt; domestic cars) and cured the problem.
&gt;   Just a thought.

Hey guys  You could probably use one from a auto trans bug . There is a 
reservoir under the drivers rear fender that does this for the clutch for the auto 
trans later and have fun  Mark Dearing
