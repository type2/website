Subject: Re: [T2] what socket

I always try to remember to go back after a couple
days of driving and re-torque critical bolts like
these. Also remember that when you re-use critical
bolts that you don't know what condition they are in
as for whether they are stretched to the max or have
internal cracks. Over-torqueing new stuff is one
thing, but even 10% over on old parts might be a risk
- you never know until you know! - BaH

 If absolutely necessary you can use an allen wrench

 the CV bolts.._dot_use the one that fits best.  The
 correct tool is preferred, too much allen-wrenching
 will strip the the socket.
 
 On this subject...make SURE you use backing plates
 (three per CV) and brand-new lock-washers (available
 from VW dealers) when you re-install the CV bolts. 
 Also don't use anti-sieze and keep the bolts and
 their
 holes free of CV grease.  Otherwise you will have CV
 bolts falling off...ask me how I know. After having
 several CV joint's fall off, I also add 10-20% to
 the
 published torque value.
