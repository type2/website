Subject: Re: [T2] Front door key code

[...]

&gt; I have recently purchased a 1970 westy, which came without keys for the
&gt; front doors (the previous owner had removed the original ignition and
&gt; apparently never locked the doors).  I would like to get new keys
&gt; cut.  However, after searching the archives I am still unclear as to where
&gt; on the handle the key code is located?

Look on the aluminum arm on the end of the tumbler. The little 'paddle' that is held on with a screw.
It will [should] have the code stamped along its length. It should look like this: 12L345. But the numbers
will be different.....
