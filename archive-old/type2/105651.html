Subject: Re: [T2] Transmission Rear Seal

The way I did it was to remove the bell housing (the rear cover) from the
differential.  It's easy, and all you need is a new  paper gasket to
re-install it.  You can also clean out any crud that has accumulated in the
diff. housing.  The oil seal is easy to R&amp;R without the drive shaft in the
way.

I got the gasket from Long Enterprises (very helpful):
