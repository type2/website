	Sounds to me like your float leval is to high, or your float has
a hole in it. To check for holes,( this test is for brass floats, if you
have the plastic float just replace it ) put the float in hot water
heated on the stove, must be HOT, if you see bubbles coming out of the
float its bad replace it, if not then the float leval is to high. Also
check the needle valve for dirt or other things that mite stop it from
closing.
	After that I don't know, maybe another listie has some ideas.
Good luck.
