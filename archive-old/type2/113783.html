Subject: Where is the heater blower switch?

Re:1976 Westy....Where/(what does it look like) is the dash switch that 
activates the heater blower motor, and how does the switch work?  I have 
read that the switch is behind the dash, near the (2 red) levers that 
operate the flapper cables.  OK, I crawled around under the dash trying to 
see how those levers mechanically operated that switch. I can see the 
levers. Two wires connect to a rectangular cube beside the lever path, on 
the side of the path toward the speedometer cluster. Is that the switch 
that activates the heater blower motor realay?

I am really uncertain about where &quot;the switch&quot; is located, and which wires 
connect with it.  The Bentley electrical diagram would be much more 
understandable if I could associate it with actual parts that I can see and 
touch under the dash.

So far, the red levers don't make the heater blower motor  (above the 
engine) run when the engine is running and the levers are in the extreme 
down position. The blower blades turn freely by hand. I intend to use a 
volt meter on the wires that seem associated with the fan relay near the 
fan motor, and I think I understand how that relay turns on the fan, but 
I'm a little fuzzy about the switch in the cabin that activates the relay.

And help or web site pointers would be GREATLY appreciated.

I read a dozen posts in the archives, but found nothing specific describing 
the switch under the dash.
