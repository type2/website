Subject: Condenser  [BOSCH] part number??
Date: Thu, 7 Sep 2000 00:43:49 -0700

The last time I bought a spare condenser for the original equipment
distributor on my 1970 1600SP I was given a BOSCH part in a box carrying the
number 02 069.  This is one of three number sequences printed on the box.

I'm looking at Jim Thompson's BOSCH specs in the Type 2 Library, and they
specify part number 02 007 for &quot;normal&quot; '69 &amp; '70 bus distributors.  The
number above is listed as pertaining to an Air Conditioning equipped bus.

I've never seen a 1600-engined US bus with A/C so I don't know where all the
machinery mounts in the engine compartment, but I'm at a loss to understand
the need for a different condenser.

Has the &quot;normal&quot; part been phased out or superseded by the &quot;A/C&quot; part
number?
