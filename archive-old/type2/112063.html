Subject: Re: [T2] 68 Baywindow: Tinker Tinker Tinker

&gt; I used my torch to warm up the area all around the grease zerk in the
&gt; center of the front end.  The lever shaft area.  While I pressed the
&gt; grease guns tip as hard as I could to the zerk and my husband pumped the
&gt; grease in the only place it finally began to emerge was through the little
&gt; hole in the relay lever shafts bottom cap.  ARG!

did you jack up the front of the bus before greasing?

&gt; Question: What in the world size thing-a-majig fits the drain and fill
&gt; doodads on the transmission?  It looks like an allen wrench the size of
&gt; Toledo.

yes and you can get the wrench for like 6-7 bucks from any vw flaps or
online vendor.


&gt; Question:  Is there anyway to make the wingwindows not flop around?  I
&gt; looked for the screws I saw in the Bently Manuel but I cannot find them on
&gt; my bus.

they wont stay open? you can tighten the screws down below. have to remove
the door panel to do it. some folk clamp down the rivet. im lazy and
usually just hold it back with a string.


&gt; Im going to do the process of static timing today.  The bus seems to be
&gt; pinging a bit more than ever.  Mostly up long hills, and this is not
&gt; nearly as hilly as up north will be.  Wish me luck!  (Actually, you might
&gt; want to wish the poor bus luck!)

i dont know what distributor you have. typical static timing will usually
end up around 7.5 degrees btdc (ish) better to time it with a strobe.
if you have one with advance set it so max advance is maybe 32-35 degrees.
i set mine like 32.
if your strobe doesnt have advance you can do a little math and mark the
flywheel at the 35 degree mark. i used to do this but now i have a degree
pulley on there.

good luck.
