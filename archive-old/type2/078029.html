Subject: rusted throw-out bearing

I'm rebuilding the engine in my '71 Westy. Matter of fact, I've been doing
so for six months  -  through a humid VA summer.  In preparation for an
imminent reinstall,  I peeked at the bell housing and found that the
surface of the throw-out bearing is now  rusted.  This was a new part with
very few miles on it.

Can I sand this with 400 or 600 paper to rejuvinate it?  Can I lubricate
its innards?

Thanks, Jack
