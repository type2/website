broken hazard switch can easily be tthe cause of turn signal problems 
and for one two be working you should expect the other to get fixed. 
 switches do break and they are easy to test.  Since you are getting 
power, it appears there is no lack of continuity in your switch.  It is 
strongly apparent that your wires are crossing somewhere since they are 
getting too much power.  according to the bentley diagram they should go 
to the emergeny flasher relay (as long as your relay is blinking it's 
probably not the culprit here).  trace them back there and make sure 
nothing is funny.  sometimes I unscrew the fuse panel just to get a 
better look at things.  one of the wires should join up with a wire that 
leads back up to your turn signal switch (see how these things are 
related).  your curiousity might lead to remove the wheel for the 
billionth time to check the switch out.  just make sure there's no 
intersections and that everything's clean.

just a note - bentley manual says that all fuses should be 8 amp for 68 
model.
