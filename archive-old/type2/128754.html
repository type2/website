Subject: Re: [T2] Painting fiberglass top question

Hi Volks,

I painted the Westfakia's roof in March of 2001 with 1 quart of 
Interlux Premium Yacht Enamel. The can cost $30CDN and was enough to 
cover the roof with two coats and still had enough left over to coat 
the bumpers as well.

You will get great results from a brush and roller, no spray-gun 
required.

Happy trails,

Greg Potts

&gt; I would call the biggest boat store in your area and see if they
&gt; carry the topside paint and then ask them about color matching. It is
&gt; expensive at $50 a gallon, but one gallon covered my top in about 4 
&gt; coats
&gt; and I still had some left.
