Subject: Re: [T2] Oil pressure sender

Hi Folks,
	Those of you that have an oil pressure sender installed for a
gauge.  How many of you now do not have an oil pressure light (from a
pressure switch)?  Are you comfortable with that set up?

Those that do have a pressure switch operated light how did you plumb the
two sensors?  I love the way AUDI(also some wc VWs) does both oil pressure
and oil temperature with both on the oil filter mount.  Anybody done this
with a Type4?

Have any of you made a circuit that senses the oil pressure signal from
the gauge sender that activates a light at low oil pressure?

Thanks. jon
