Subject: RE: Exhaust valves at .008?

&gt;Michael,
&gt;  I concur with David, have been setting my exhaust valves at 0.008&quot; for
&gt;years. What's more, I have the original VW tuneup sticker on the engine
&gt;(engine code AW, 1800cc), and it says 0.006&quot; intake, 0.008&quot; exhaust. The
&gt;extra clearance is because they're sodium-filled for more efficient heat
&gt;transfer.

If memory serves, Muir adresses this issue, claiming firmly that it's
0.006&quot;, and to &quot;put a piece of tape over that sticker if it bothers you.&quot;
For the record, I set mine at 0.006&quot;.  If I understand the process
correctly, larger clearances mean the valve is open less time, allowing for
cooler valves, but less efficient/effective movement of gasses into and out
of the cylinder.
