Subject: Front Brake Pads

I am doing some brake work on Possum. Replacing the master cylinder and all hoses. I replaced the front pads about 8k back when I also did the rear shoes and wheel cylinders. I used some cheap pads from FLAPS. I have now noticed that the pads are pretty well toast. The inner pads seem to be worn a little more than the outers but both are worn none the less. Calipers seem to be functioning properly. Rear shoes are adjusted and seem to be working fine. Have not pulled off the drum to look at wear yet though. This is not a daily driver, use has been primarily camping in the mountains driving on crappy gravel roads with very steep grades, along with some towing of my 14' sailboat around town to regattas. My thoughts are that the front pads were cheap and wore out quickly. Better than having hard pads and trashing my rotors. Question is can you guys tell me your experience with the Pagid pads that I see Bus Depot selling? They sound like good pads and I wanted to get some feedback. I dont
 mind replacing pads every 8-10k if it means my rotors stay true longer, but maybe there is a better solution...
 
 
Thanks
