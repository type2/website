&gt; Condensor (capacitors) should have infinite resistance. However, they may

Yeah, I was testing it wrong.  I realized that when I changed it.  I
didn't bother to test it though, once I had it out.  I was too busy
dancing in the street since the ol' beast was running better.

Thanks for the info,
Ken
