Subject: Re: [T2] advance/retard

Greg,

Not wrong.  Both extreme's will cause hotter running than normal if not
calculated into the overal engine basics.

IIRC, VW started using retard sections on their distributors to get 
the engine to pass emissions...wanted it to run hotter at idle IIRC
so that emissions would be down.

The only departure from that rule is a'la Berg when using very low 
Compression Ratio's...advand 2-6 degrees more.


Cheers, dave

&gt; I keep hearing reference to retarding timing to cool an engine down.  This 
&gt; seems contradictory to what I thought I knew years before and to my own

&gt; retarded ever so slightly, it had slower performance and ran hotter than 
&gt; normal.  I was under the impression that advancing (no more than total 
&gt; allowable) made it run cooler.  Where did I go wrong?
