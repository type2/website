Subject: valve clicking, 78 2.0L w/ hydraulic lifters

On a type-IV 2.0L engine w/ hydraulic lifters, what's it mean when a
valve never stops clicking?  Drive it 200 miles, and you still hear it
ticking away back there.  Compression is fine both cylinders that head
(135 and 145 last check).  Engine history unknown [probably original
engine for this bus, with either 80K or 180K, and may or may not have
been rebuilt sometime in the past (but not in the last 40K miles,
according to PO)].
