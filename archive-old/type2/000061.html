Subject: HEATER NOTIONS(CO DETECTORS)
Message-ID: &lt;0.55d426a5.254a7b9c_at_aol_dot_com&gt;

I have been following the thread on heaters and want to add that I found a 
neat little CO detector in a general aviation (small airplanes) pilot shop. 
It is a little plastic plate with a colored material in the center. It is 
good for 90 days after opening and costs about $3.00 each. I know, a house 
type permanent detector might be cheaper over long term use but as a quick 
check it is so simple. If CO is in the air, the spot changes color. It is 
small, about 2 inches square and I can tape it into place almost anywhere. 
Small planes use heat exchangers for cabin heat. Their engines are configured 
similar to our bus engines. I think I once heard of an aviation modification 
to VW engines. 
An added note. I leave my heat valves (flaps?) closed until my engine has run 
for a few minutes and cleaned all the latent smells from the engine 
compartment out. 
I am till looking for the skid pan under the front of my bus. I am checking 
junkyards near home first.

Take care,
Dana
