&gt;&gt; I have a 75 westy with an automatic transmission.  I am in the process of
&gt;&gt; rebuilding the engine now and it seems everything is broke.  When I first
&gt;&gt; bought it I brought it down to get looked over and the mechanic called me
&gt;&gt; saying the gear box was filled with red transmission fluid, it was leaking

&gt; ???? not sure what you mean, the final drive had tranny fluid??

I'll bet he means the differential. That is supposed to be full of
differential gear oil, not ATF. It may be that the previous owner filled
it with the wrong stuff, or maybe the ATF is somehow leaking in there
through a crack? Either way, this is bad news.

&gt;&gt; hundred miles before i started the rebuild.  When I pulled the engine I
&gt;&gt; found that the cast iron casing that the engine is mounted to on torque
&gt;&gt; converter has a large chunck broke off (enough that one of the bolts
&gt;&gt; doesn't have anything to connect to)...

&gt; again not sure what part you mean...

I'll bet he means the bell housing for the torque converter, which
attaches to the engine with 4 big bolts. This is a problem too. Sounds
like the bell housing got clobbered hard by something, maybe hard enough
to also cause the leak discussed above.

I generally agree with your comments. But I paid $300 for a (barely) used
auto tranny with a (used) torque converter a few years back. Mine came
from an '81 Vanagon and it still fit my '78 bus perfectly, except for one
weird bracket near the shifter that I threw away. Maybe I was overcharged
(I probably could have haggled more), but it was way cheaper than
rebuilding my old dead one. It generally costs $700-$1400 to rebuild a VW
auto tranny, depending on how much inside needs replacing.  They generally
can't tell you what the bill will be until they tear it down and see
what's in there. They should be good for 250K miles on a rebuild, I am
told. They often outlive several engines.

Your actual mileage may vary,
