Subject: [T2]Less expensive cd player?

just curious if anyone has a old cd player that works that they would wont to get rid of 20,25  bucks...
wife needs a cd player for her beetle and says she dont care if it is used or not and money being what it is sounds like a decent gift for christmas for her if thats what she wants..
let me know...
29316 zip code...
please only if it works though that would suck to put it in the car and turn it on for her christmas morning and it not work...LOL...
doesnt have to be a great radio she says she is tired of singing to herself...
going to get her another one like i have in the bus later on but right now she just wants something to get her some tunes.. we accidentally left the cd player in the buick when we traded it for the bug ooops... was a brand new one also but a 12 hour ride there sucked our thoughts away from us....
thanks anyone and everyone
peace and love
chris
may even consider just a radio but cant spend much more than round 20 bucks got a couple other things got to get out of layaway as well...


Peace and Love
