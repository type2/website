The Inuvik Run -- The Lake Region

9 August

(Log entry)

At Chubb Lake.  496 miles in 10.1 hours.  Tired.  Mosquitos pretty
bad.

- -------------

The dismal campsite at Stewart was the last time I would see Jack
and Jorge &amp; Yvette.  Their itinerary called for them to travel to
Prince Rupert and take the ferry from there to Vancouver Island. 
Eddie &amp; his dad and I would take the poor people's route overland
to Prince George, retracing our route south to Clinton then
following BC1 to Hope.  

I had planned to restock my larder at Stewart and do some
maintenance, possibly laying over a day to visit the glacier and
take pictures of the bears.  The red-neck nature of the town ruled
that out and we broke camp early.

We ran out of the rain shortly before reaching the junction of the
Cassiar and Highway 16, which would take us east across the Lake
Region of British Columbia to Prince George and the Cariboo (sic)
Highway.

Near Vanderhoof we pulled into a rest area so I could do an oil
change and take care of minor maintenance.  The weather was good,
road conditions were excellent and we had been making good time. 
We stopped again at Prince George, refueling and calling home.  It
was a mild Friday evening.  From Prince George we continued south
on the Cariboo to Strathnaver where we turned off the highway in
search of another free camp site, this one at Chubb Lake.  We found
the lake then the camp and were grateful.  The 496 miles from
Stewart was the longest one-day run of the trip.
