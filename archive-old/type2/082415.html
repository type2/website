&gt; Rob, don't remember for sure what year you are working on,=20

It's a 79.

&gt; How long since you changed the fuel filter?
&gt; I would change filters first.  Then do the other test.

I have only owned this vehicle for a short time (never driven it.)  The
fuel filter looks nice and shiny, if that means anything, and when I =
pulled
the pump off, fuel flowed very rapidly from the filter.

&gt;=20
&gt; make sure you watch the gauge as the pump is running as it should hit
&gt; 125psi+ almost instantly if you have a good pump and have the=20
&gt; fuel ring
&gt; squeezed off on the regulator end. =20
&gt;=20
&gt; This is gonna be dangerous...

Maybe not, as it seems to becoming more evident that my pump is
garbage.

Thanks,

Rob
