Subject: [T2] WIN!! New t2 Magazine 1st edition

Just received 2 copies of the new &quot;Volkswagen Camper &amp; Commercial&quot; Mag. (82
pages of bus ONLY content!)

I am offering 1 copy as a prize for the winner of the top 10 things NOT to
do _at_ a VW show! See events page for an idea what I mean. The winners
suggestion will be posted there &amp; with the runners up. Get writing! Closing
date is boxing day.
