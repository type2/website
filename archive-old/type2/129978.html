Subject: Re: [T2] Help identifying an old Weber carb

&gt;   I am having trouble identifying the carbs on my bus.  It's a dual Weber carb set-up.  They are small, similar to what is often called the 'baby Weber' on the VW scene, but not the same.  It is a single barrel carb.  
&gt;&lt;deletia&gt;
&gt;   Are these stock at all?  Please let me know if you have any info that might help me.  My girlfriend works at a machine shop and they are 'cleaning up' the old needle and seat for me so I can hopefully use the needle I have for now, but I'd like to see about getting rebuild kits for both carbs.

I picked up a pair of those at a swap meet several years back, and my local (at the time) VW APS *had* seen
them before, but didn't have much good news.  Apparently they were imported for awhile (6 months to a year, 
IIRC) back in the early or mid '80s, then vanished from the market.  He didn't remember much more about
them, or who had imported them.  

My accel pump diaphragm and needle &amp; seat were in good shape, so I cut some new gaskets and used 'em 
for about a year, then picked up a decent pair of Solex PDSIT carbs.  I *think* I've still got 'em around
someplace, if you'd be interested I can dig around in my boxes and see if I can find them for you..
