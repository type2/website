Steve asks:

&gt;What do you think?   Anyone with experience with an 
&gt;autostick?  Please help.

The first car that I bought was a beige '70 Beetle, with an autostick
tranny. I loved it, because I had never driven a stick, and didn't have
to learn to use a clutch (until I bought my blue '66 Beetle the next
year :) ). The only trouble I had was that the vacuum bottle, under the
right rear wheel, rotted out. I went thru three of them. But this was
because it was a daily driver in Cleveland, Ohio, year round. In the
winter, there is LOTS of salt on the roads here. It is what finally
killed it, because the frame rotted out. But the engine and tranny were
still strong. Just be sure that metal vacuum bottle is sound.
