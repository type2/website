I drive The Mothership, a 1979 transporter with a westy interior.  She has
181,000 miles on the original engine and has toured the country two and one
half times.  one and one half with me, once with the PO.

&quot;Lessons learned are like bridges burned, you only need to cross them but

worth the cost of the heart?&quot;
