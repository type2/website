Subject: Re: Bus interior conversion

Yeah, I know this thread floated by a long time ago, but I couldn't find 
the original post.  Anyway, I converted my '78 from seven passenger to 
camper earlier this year.  It was cheap, easy, and turned out great (just 
slept in it last night).  The most important single factor in converting 
a standard bus to a camper: it's easier to find a good bus when you have 
a wide field to choose from.  Anyway, feel free to contact me directly if 
you're wondering.
