Subject: sliding door part needed

A Plea For a Part:

Does anyone have the lower dual roller bearing piece that is on the sliding
door of my bay window.  This part is sort of an 'L' shaped part with two
roller bearings like I mentioned before.
The bottom of the sliding door....It's the guidepiece for it.
I'd like it to be off the same year bus if possible as any other years don't
seem to be the exact same part.
I'm looking for this part for a '76 hardtop westie...........
Thanks so much to Brandt for trying but his part didn't match up to the one
that snapped in half.
I talked to a welder and he says they are aluminum and he could never weld
it strong enough, I needed a new part and my mechanic is at a loss in
finding the part himself.

PLEASE email me ASAP vwbusgirl_at_kc.rr_dot_com
if you can mail me this part as I'm trying to get the camper ready for an
upcoming campout in MO.

Thanks to ALL!
Peace,
Sunshine
