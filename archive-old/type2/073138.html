&gt;#2. Slimey Dealership, '75 Campmobile with what appears to be a
&gt;Riviera-style top. The body appears to be pretty darn good, though the
&gt;brand new (and putrid umber color) paint might be covering a multitude
&gt;of sins.

A magnet tells all. If it really is a Riviera, it is the coolest thing going.

&gt;Both boxes are going for $1000.

LOL! Exactly what alternatives does Slimy Dealership have if it doesn't
sell to some gaping moron for a grand? Take it to the local auction? In
pieces? I'd offer $200 and stop back by once a week to see whether they've
changed their minds yet. He can't possibly afford to repair that bus to
salable condition, he couldn't get his money back out, so as it sits it is
nothing but a junkyard car and should be negotiated as such.

Really, dealers are keenly aware that it costs money to carry dead
inventory and they won't do it for long. Be patient and strong. Just don't
go for a rusty one if you can help it.

It will not be cheap to get it running again, Joe Fournier is currently up
to his elbows repairing a Type IV Riviera, he can tell you about it much
better than me.
