Subject: Replacement seats for '69 camper

Hi,
        The two front seats in my '69 camper are getting pretty beaten up.
Has anyone put a set of newer seats in a similar vintage bus?  I was
thinking of trying a junkyard and maybe trying to locate a set of vanagon
seats, or late breadloaf seats.  Will they fit right in, or do you have to
do some modifications to get them to fit?

thanks,

John
