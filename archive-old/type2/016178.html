It is my understanding that you can also use a simple T-fitting at the fuel
outlet on the tank to avoid changing tanks.  I can't imagine why this can't
be done as long as both fittings are in the unpressurized line between the
fuel pump and the tank.  It would save a lot of trouble.  Has anybody had
problems doing it this way?  I recently installed a 79 2.0 FI in a 74 Westy
using this method.

&gt;my 1972 westy is getting the 1700cc carbed engine replaced with a 
&gt;2Ltr with stock fuel injection.  It's at the Tech Shop in Seattle

&gt;You probably already know this, but you'll need a gas tank from a fuel
injected 
&gt;bus.  The carbed buses only have a fuel outlet tube on the bottom of the
tank 
&gt;while the FI buses have an outlet tube and a return tube.
