Subject: Re: [T2] Reassembled engine adjusting valves. 78 T2

2 turns is the official Bentley amount. There have been some people on
the list which advise less, but always at least 1/2 turn past contact.
I set mine to 1.5 turns past contact. I do this because from
trial/error I have found that at least on my bus, this seems to cause
the least amount of bleed while setting. That is, at 1.5 turns on my
bus I notice loud lifters at startup the least. of course YMMV etc.
Just make sure that the lifters have been pumped up when doing a final
set.

&gt; well we pt a new head on the bus and now adjusting
&gt; valves, we're gettinga lot of different opinions on
&gt; how to do this best(their hydraulic) can someone tell
&gt; us definately how to do this? Currently we are going
&gt; to go 2 turns past contact. Is this correct?
