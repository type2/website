In case you needed a laugh...
Just got back from ACE hardware in NW Portland (Pearl Hardware, for you
locals). I asked the person wandering the fasteners section about an M6
nut and washer. &lt;puzzled look&gt; &quot;Lemmme get &lt;name omitted to protect the
innocent&gt;, he's the expert on this stuff&quot;. I tell the guy I &quot;need an M6
nut&quot;. He looks at me like I just sprouted a second head and says &quot;you
mean a 6mm nut&quot;. &quot;no, that nut looks too small&quot;, I said. &quot;I was told
that M6 is the naming or sizing convention of the nut and washer I
need.&quot; His response: &quot;I have no idea what that is, try a 6mm.&quot;
Good stuff, eh? Too bad I work in the foofoo part of the city with a
wide variety of weird food for $20+ a plate, but only one poorly
staffed hardware store, where I could choose from a wide assortment of
$$$ chandeliers, but can't find a $.10 nut.

Oh, bus content: I gave the bus a test drive yestreday after completing
the install of the air flaps, and the ACN thermostat. I found the flaps
hadn't moved after I got home from ~20 minutes of driving. I
push/pulled a bit on the thing the cable connects to, and the flaps
gave a bit and then opened. Are they hung up on something, or did the
heat increase ust enough after I shut off the motor? When I checked
this morning, the flaps were closed. No, I don't have any temperature
guages yet.

&gt; &gt; me novice. m6 translates into what threadsize for the guy at the
&gt; &gt; hardware store that will look at me crosseyed when I say &quot;M6&quot;?
&gt; &gt; Thanks!
&gt; 
&gt; paul, 
&gt; 
&gt; it doesn't translate. it is m6. if the guy looks at you funny when
&gt; you ask
&gt; for an m6 nut then you need to go to another store. i think even good
&gt; old
&gt; home depot sells metric fasteners.
