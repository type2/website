&gt; Although the flaps should be there, and whenever you get the chance you
&gt; should install them,
&gt; MY OPINION is that this is not an &quot;Oh God I cna't drive my bus until I fix&quot;
&gt; it situation.

I agree that panic should be avoided but I think if this were my bus I
would not drive it on warm days if the flaps were missing.  With the
flaps missing on a Type 4, air is not being ducted through the oil
cooler.  Period.  If this does not concern you, then drive on but it
seems to me the oil cooler is a very important part of the cooling
system and driving with no air flow through the oil cooler is akin to
driving with it blocked off or clogged up.  Doesn't seem like a good
idea to me.
