&gt; Rotating the engine in a bus is simple.  I have always used and highly

&gt; BACKWARD 180 degrees, do #2, rotate BACKWARD 180 degrees, do #3, rotate
&gt; BACKWARD 180 degrees and do #4.  Simple.  100% accurate.

&gt; Oh yeah, and if you didn't already know, do your valves stone-cold.

Mike:
I totally agree with that method. I do think however that you have WAY
more than 8 degrees tolerance- more like 90 before or after tdc. I have
no idea how many degrees long are the clearance ramps (the area of the
cam lobe profile that begins and ends the valve action with slow
acceleration rates to keep the stresses down) but I'm guessing aroun 45
(crank) degrees. Since the intake closes shortly after bdc (as the
compression stroke begins) probably about 25-35 degrees, add in the 45
degrees for the clearance ramps, you still have 100 degrees btdc.
[180-(35+45)=100] 
I'm just guessing on all these numbers, having never put a degree wheel
on a VW engine in my life (although I have on a lot of *hevy V-8's and a
few Porsches).
My point is that you don't need a degree wheel, just a WIDE piece of
chalk to put that mark on for 2 &amp; 4.
As regards Ian's later post, my best guess as to why it ran better with
looser valves is that it had reduced the  duration of the cam profile,
which makes the engine more efficient at low speeds. However what you
gain on the bottom will be (more than) lost on the top. This is a trick
that can be used to  some advantage to fine tune a motor (usually with a
larger than stock cam, however). In other words, if you were needing
more tractability for rock climbing or pulling logs out of a field you
might find some improvement by setting the valves (uniformly) any where
up to .008-.010 additional clearance. This is not a very common type 2
complaint however. Most people want more top speed.
