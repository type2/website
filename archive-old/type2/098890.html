There is a White Lighting version of the Johnny Lighting busses.  I thought
that they came with white rims but I have never seen one so can't be sure.
When I got my cases of the green SC the guy from Playing Mantis (Maker of
JL) emailed me and asked if I had gotten any White Lightning green SC  I had
not but I made sure and looked
