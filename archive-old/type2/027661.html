Subject: Chuck Meanley sighting

Greetings folks:

Chuck left Vancouver BC last night, and I bought him breakfast here in 
Portland OR this morning.  I offered him the choice of two places: one that 
goes in the scrambled tofu with garlic and garnish direction, and one that's 
more along the 50s chrome diner [not faux retro, just never saw the point of 
changing] route. He chose the latter:  Coffee w/cream, omelette and 
hashbrowns.  He was back on the road by 9am and headed in the general 
direction of Fresno CA and points south.

We saw a fair number of local buses going about their business in and around 
the Pearl District.

It was a good visit; he says hello.

Keep an eye out for him on I-5.
Bill
