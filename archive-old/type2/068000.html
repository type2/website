&gt;With the guilt free scenario set up.
&gt;What is your fantasy non-stock, modified bus?
&gt;
&gt;- Jeff

I've already got my fantasy non-stock midifed bus! He's &quot;Stubby&quot;. A '59
Single Cab shortened up 40&quot;. He's pretty much completely disassembled out
in the garage at the moment. He's waiting for a rebirth come next summer.

Any suggestion as far as the engine goes? Should I just rebuild the 1600
DP that it has or go with something else?
