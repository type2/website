&gt; I just installed a bn4 heater in our bus and got it fired up, do these things 
&gt; generally run with lots of exhaust smoke. It was dirty like it was burning 

most I've seen will make a little smoke the first time it is fired up
after sitting a while but that is just the dirt being burned off..when in
regular service it should have a clear exhaust

&gt; very inefficiently. After running for about 5 minutes it quit and won;t fired up 
&gt; neither will the fan even run, any ideas ,thanks Dylan

sounds like a safety fuse or breaker trippped, check first the overheat
fuse, it shuts everything down
