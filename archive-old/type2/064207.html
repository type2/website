&gt;fluid or gear oil. Well, I smelled it, and it is gear oil. I take it this
&gt;means that there is a leaky seal between my reduction box and the brake
&gt;drum, right? It looks like I'm going to have to change my rear brake shoes,

The other possibility is a loose cover plate for the bearing cover,
indicating worn bearings.  Clean it up and see where the fluid is coming
from - out the axle, or around the cover.
