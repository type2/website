Subject: Re: &lt;FMBC&gt; 71 Single Cab Wiring Harness

Just a question regarding installing a new harness. I recently 're-wired' my
bus but I didn't replace
the wires running through the steel tube under the floor as I couldn't see
how to.
How do you get around this????? I would like to have done this but it's a
little late now.
