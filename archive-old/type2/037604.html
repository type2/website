Subject: Australian Sabbatical - 1st sent on Fri.

I'm traveling to Australia after the Olympics this year and I will be looking 
for a Type 2 in Sydney upon arrival.  I'd like to buy one in good shape and 
travel the country with it camping along the way. 

Any info on auto clubs, registration laws, travel tips, etc. would be great.  
I'll return the favor by buying you a frosted adult beverage of your choice 
when I pass through your locale.
