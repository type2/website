Subject: 75 camper for sale.

hello all!!  i have a 75 penthouse camper for sale in pa.  it has the full 
camping interior and a potop that goes straight up with another bed up top.  
has a coleman stove, a sink, a frig, and some p;eather like interior with 
cloth in the center.  it has a rebuilt engine that was put in with dual baby 
weber carbs that hasn't been ran in five years untill a few months ago.  i 
had it running, but probably needs a valve adjustment and the carbs rebuilt.  
its in pretty decent shape, the paint is a custom roll on job.  a little rust 
nothing too major... i am looking to trade a bug for it.  or a71- back bus.  
i could also sell it, but looking for something with a type 1 engine.  email 
me for more info..
thanks
mike
