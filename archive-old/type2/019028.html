Rich,
I feel that the back seat of a westy is about as safe as most other vehicles
as long as the car seat fits nice and tight.  We own a total of 3 car seats
and only one fits in our bus the way a car seat should.  You just need to
look around until you find a car seat that fits properly.  Once that's
established you just need to be the safest driver on the road.

&gt; hi all
&gt;
&gt; Just a question;  has anyone put a car seat in the back of a westy?  My
&gt; wife and I just had our first child (Alexis), and I want to take her for
&gt; her first ride in the camper.  She is a little nervous about the seatbelts
&gt; in the back, I think they work fine. Any advice?
