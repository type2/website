&gt; &gt; I am going to purchase a head temp and oil pressure first. Later on I'll
&gt; &gt; add oil temp. So I want to plan
&gt; &gt; on provisions for three. I am not really sure where I want to mount them
&gt; &gt; yet. Where are yours mounted and how do you like them there?

If these numbers are important to you, mount the guages on a pod on top of
the dash.  The closer the guages are to your line of sight, the more
likely you are to notice a problem before it gets bad.
