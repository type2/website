Subject: Charlie's Angels, Bus Write-off

    Has anyone yet rented Charlie's Angels?
You gotta see the scene where a poor unsuspecting Type 2 Blue &amp; White
Transporter gets totaled!
I must admit I cringed to see it but with a DVD player you can see every
frame as it gets hit by a late model American car.
The stunt was quite a feat.  Unfortunately for the bus it was a
write-off.  Let's hope it wasn't roadworthy. Otherwise it'd be like
Garth Brooks  smashing acoustic guitars on stage.  As John Hiatt wrote
in his song, &quot;Smashing a Perfectly Good Guitar.&quot;
