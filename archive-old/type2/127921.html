Subject: Hello again!

Like Erik says: Hi Volks!

 

I've received several e-mails from you, all very encouraging. Thank you.
Sorry I couldn't answer before, but last week was very relaxed here in Peru
and I didn't check my mail. 28 of July was Peru's national day and everybody
takes advantage of these days to travel to the highlands. The national day
vacations are 28, 29, 30 and 31! So everybody escapes from the cold and damp
weather of Lima in search for the sun and dry weather of the &quot;sierra&quot;. In my
case I went with my wife and friends to Huaraz, a town 7 hours away from
Lima (350Km's aprox.)

 

So, here are the answers to some questions:

As long as I know, my father bought this bus from an American guy. I think
this person brought the bus from Germany to the USA and then to Peru. And
indeed it isn't a Brazil version - It's original German.

 

I haven't had the chance to look at the M-plate yet. I promise to take the
bus out of the garage and look for it.

 

The plastic cap in the front was indeed taken from the trunk :-)!

 

Please send me any other details you have seen from my pictures. It will
help me know better my bus. And if you want to know any other things, let me
know.

 

Kina regards,

 

Bernd N. Wolniczak
