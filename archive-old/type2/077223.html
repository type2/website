&gt; Hi Folks,
&gt;
&gt; A friend of mine has a '71 Westy with a rebuilt 1641, and has a question
&gt; about platinum plugs.  Please reply to him at: whoajesus_at_hotmail_dot_com
&gt;
&gt; Does anyone have any experience with &quot;platinum&quot; spark plugs in the 1600
&gt; engine? Muir says don't use them (but doesn't say why); but Bob Hoover
&gt; recommends them -- mostly because they last longer between plug changes and
&gt; fewer plug changes means less stress on the head over its lifetime.

Jason,

Years ago, shortly after Bosch started making these, I bought a set for a
1600 DP T1 engine.  I had a very bad experience, fouling, running hot,
missing etc. etc.  I was told by a mechanic I trusted that they were &quot;a
bad thing&quot; in the T1 engine, so I ditched them and have never looked back.
As I (vaguely) remember, his take was that the thin electrode in them
fouled too easily and that the heat range was wrong for the T1 engine.

The caveats to this story are:
(a) it was *not* a new engine;
(b) it was a long time ago, so the plug design may have changed.
