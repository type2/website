I have a type II, with a type 4 engine. I thought I read in the archives
something about engines only being  called T, like T4. A type IV is a
squareback, right? So does saying I have a type IV engine mean I have a
squareback engine in there? Or should it be that I have a Type II with a T4
engine? I've looked at a couple websites, but sometimes they contradict each
other. 

This actually matters, since I read stuff about engines and I don't know
what applies to me or not. :)
