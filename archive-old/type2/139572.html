Subject: Re: [T2] Synthetic Oil: done to death?

Rocket,

Archives on this one please...pointers to the latest stuff in there as 
well as discussion and links to one of the magazine articles where they 
did heat tests on a real live engine.

Search for synthetic.

This is a near religious issue!&lt;grin&gt;...and we all been there and donethat 
more than a few times already&lt;big grin&gt;...read all of the discussion in 
the archives(pro and con) and then if you have questions, come back.

Cheers, dave

&gt; The question is, do we like or not like synthetic motor oil in our 
&gt; aircooled upright engines? Gets pretty hot in SoCal pushing a 
&gt; Transporter down the Interstate and my oil sump temps are pushing 230F 
&gt; -- where dino oil is ready to exhibit thermal breakdown. Synth oil is 
&gt; reputed to stand off higher temps -- yes/no?
&gt; 
&gt; Oh -- for some odd reason, I can post NEW threads to the type2 list, but 
&gt; my REPLIES to existing threads are not getting posted.
