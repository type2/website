I'm getting into this late, for reasons beyond my control, but I have
written extensively on this subject [check Type 2 List archives].

The best I've found, after 15+ years of boat and Campmobile experience with
several models and brands, is the largest Sears Pak-a-potti.  It's a
re-labeled Thetford, but is usually priced lower [much lower on sale].  Be
sure to get the 6+ gallon holding tank.

This unit is by far the most convenient to use, and more importantly the
easiest to empty, clean, and service.  We've used regular TP for years, much
cheaper than the special &quot;RV&quot; paper, and we buy our dry chemical at Boater's
World on sale.

Thetford/Sears have recently introduced a battery powered electric flushing
version of this unit.  Since we've never had any problem with the manual
flush system, I'd advise against the push-button flush setup.  Just one more
thing to go haywire at an inconvenient time or place.

FWIW.....

&gt; Is the Porta Potti brand a good one or is there
&gt; something better for under $100?  I am looking for any opinions on this as
I
&gt; will buy something tomorrow.  Thanks.

&gt;&gt;  Pat, go to Sears, they sell the Thetford brand which I have learned is
about
as good as you can buy.  Get the largest, 6 gallon I think, it will be a bit
taller and more useful in the long run (no pune intended).  &lt;&lt;
