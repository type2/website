Subject: rebuild compression and cam indexing help!!!

------=_NextPart_000_0046_01C165E1.11A27130
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

see my previous posts in the digest if you want to hear the continuing =
saga...

been getting great advice from everyone on the list, and a friend here =
in seattle... as for whether or not my cam/crank are meshed correctly, i =
checked the following: turned the engine clockwise watching the #3 =
(left, forward of bus) valves... exhaust opens and closes, and intake =
immediately opens and closes... the point where it switches - exhaust =
just finishes closing and intake just starts opening - should be TDC for =
number 1 right? my pulley notch does indeed point right at the 0...

so if this is right, what else could possible give me blowback into the =
intake headers? as far as i've been told ONLY incorrectly inserted =
distributor drive shaft/timing, badly seating valves, or something wrong =
with the cam... which begs the question of whether or not i could =
possibly have been given the wrong cam... the one i bought had the gear =
bolted (not riveted) on... is it possible to bolt the shaft to the cam =
wrongly? is it possible to have a shaft that would give me correct TDC, =
but not open and close # 2 and #4 valves correctly? one of my mechanic =
friends suggested that if i was desperate, it's possible to take the oil =
pump off in situ and see if the notches on the cam/crank are aligned =
properly... anyone done this with the engine in? any advice as to how to =
do so?

two other questions:

engine hasn't been run yet - did a compression check and it came back =
70, 75, 75, 75... is this possible for a new, cold rebuild that hasn't =
run yet? it's also entirely possible i need a new tester as mine is =
something like 20 years old (stole if from my dad back when he drove all =
six of us around in the 72 micro)... if it's not my gauge, and a cold =
new engine shouldn't be low like this i'm kinda worried... but what in =
the world would give me such even (if low) compression?

second question : tried determining if i have good spark - had all four =
plugs out from compression check, and i plugged one back into a wire and =
held it against ground and had a friend turn it over - yellow snapping =
spark - definitely not blue/white...  my coils ancient, and it's gone =
through many radio ons without engine running - possible it's the =
culprit but can anyone suggest a way to test without getting a new coil? =
pretty sure my batterys good, and my point gap is right on...

another thing - to make sure i've static timed it right for first =
firing:

as it runs its going to advance (ie, move the notch in the &quot;VOR&quot; or =
before TDC direction - to the left on the timing indicator) as the =
engine is sped up right?... so when i static time it shouldn't i static =
time it to a little more (to the right) of the 5 deg &quot;NACH&quot; mark (to the =
right of the 0 mark on the timing indicator)... that way when the engine =
idle vaccum pulls on it, it will advance it slightly - or does it at =
idle speed?

the point is, i need a solid description of exaclty where i should put =
the timing mark to static time it (and i took german many years ago so i =
know that &quot;VOR&quot; means &quot;before&quot; and &quot;NACH&quot; means &quot;after&quot;) - also, what am =
i looking for with static timing? the rotor moves clockwise correct? do =
i want to have my test lamp light where the rotor FIRST encounters the =
contact in the cap (ie turn the dist clockwise till the light disappears =
and then counterclockwise till it just turns on)?

many many many thanks for everyone's help and hopefully i'll get this =
figured out soon...
