I'm not surprised that your bus leaks.  Stock '71 buses break when they're 
driven at 70 MPH for long periods.  If you need to drive 70 you should get 
some other kind of vehicle.  A '71 bus can be very inexpensive to operate and 
last a long time if you don't abuse it.  Also, I'm not surprised that you 
&quot;can do it with your eyes closed at this point&quot;.  You're going to get lots 
more practice at pulling and repairing that engine if you keep driving at 70.
