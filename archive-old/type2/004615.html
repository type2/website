Beth and Jon:

Was it running bettter before the tune up?  If so, take a few minutes and
look at every thing that you touched and/or replaced to see if it's in
correctly.  For example, a badly connected or disconnected spark plug wire
on one of the cylinders (ay the plug or at the dizzy) would cause the
problem you described.   It's more likely that something that  you worked on
is not quite right then some new problem just occured.  This is one of the
first things I was told by a buddy when I started to work on my first volks
back in college, and this advice has served me well for many years....  ;^)

There is quite a bit in the archives about finding vacuum leaks;  I'm
partial to the spraying carb cleaner or  WD-40 method;   however,  you need
to be careful to not overdo it because of the fire potential.

I'd suggest that you think  (once you get it running)  about replacing the
points with a petronix (sp?) ignition - definitly (IMHO)  worth the bucks -
never mess with those points again....

&quot;Don't give up!&quot;  If you've figured out how to use the e-mail program on
your computer, you can figure out  20+ year old car technology.  8^)

&gt;After our recent attempt to do a tune-up yesterday we are here with a
&gt;lousily (?) running bus.  My husband did figure out the correct order
&gt;for the spark plug wires, so that is ok.  We managed to set the points
&gt;(boy did that take long time) and change the plugs, cap and rotor.  The
&gt;symptoms now are that it runs well out on the road or anytime your foot
&gt;is on the gas pedal, but if you take foot off the gas it dies right
&gt;out.  We did find a vacuum hose that was disconnected but suspect there
&gt;is another one that is either cracked or disconnected but cannot find
&gt;it.  Any ideas?  I hate to give up and take it in to get looked at
&gt;because I was very psyched about doing this ourselves, but it runs worse
&gt;not than before we started.  Tell me not to give up, please! thanks,
&gt;Beth and the 1978 Hippychickmobile.
