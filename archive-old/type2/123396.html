Subject: Re: [T2] voltage regulator

Hi Folks,

With flame suit firmly in place, I wanted to throw in my 2 cents here as 
well.

A couple of years ago I had my generator light come on while on the way to a 
weekend campout.  The closest town was Grand Junction, Colorado, and they 
don't have much in the way of ACVW stuff, especially at 3:00 on a Friday 
afternoon.  Anyway, after going to AutoZone and getting 2 regulators that 
were completely wrong (counter clerk could only read the back of the blister 
pack) and returning them, I was advised to go to NAPA across town.  At NAPA 
I got the old-timer who knew a thing or two, and paid something like $45 
(too much) for a VW-specific, non-OEM regulator.  Long story short, it 
turned out that the problem was a failed original alternator, and I didn't 
need the regulator after all.  Once I solved the problem, I plugged my OE 
Bosch regulator in and it's still working fine, 2 years later.

My point is, if you're worried about your OE unit (and aren't we all, after 
this week's thread?), spend the $10 for a cheap replacement.  Bolt it to the 
firewall next to your OE Bosch regulator, and when the 25+-year-old unit 
finally does fail, pull over, unplug the failed original, plug in the cheap 
replacement, and keep going.  Once you get home and get time, find the 
correct part and replace it at your leisure.  May you never be stranded or 
want for the correct parts.

Good luck!
