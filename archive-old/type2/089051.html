Subject: Re: [T2] Starter problem

[...]

A word of advice:
This starter may fit a boatload of cars and buses but it will NOT work on a
228mm flywheel in a 76-79 bus.

And a 80-83  Vanagon 2.0L starter will NOT work on a 76-79 bus. The position
of the solenoid is wrong and hits the bus body.

&gt; &gt;A.  Is the SR17X the so-called &quot;automatic&quot; starter, that's self-supporting
&gt; &gt;without a bushing?
&gt;
&gt; Yes. This is also the correct starter for the Porsche 911/912. Same starter
&gt; as well as the 928 EXCEPT the 928 rotates the opposite direction, so
&gt; carries a different no. but the case and solenoid and guts are the same. A
&gt; VERY robust starter, as would be expected of anything approved by Porsche.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; &gt;B.  Will this starter fit a stock 1970 bell housing, 1600SP case, etc.?
&gt;
&gt; I'm not sure. Don't have the book here at home to verify.
