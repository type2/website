&gt;  This is getting stupid, someone please confirm i'm not mad.............
&gt;  
&gt;  Bear with me, I know numbers are boring. Just for the books, my chassis
&gt;  number starts with
&gt;  235, 2 = Type 2, 3 = Kombi/camperwagen and the 5, I am to understand means
&gt;  the '5' in
&gt;  1965.
&gt;  The rest of the number is 076 845.
&gt;  
&gt;  My Splitty DVLC owners document says it's a 73 or a 78 (can't remember *:-)
&gt;  ) Kombi 7
&gt;  seater.
&gt;  I phoned VW in Milton Keynes asking for the production date and they sent
&gt;  me a letter
&gt;  saying &quot;we are writing to confirm that your vehicle was manufactured 18th
&gt;  December 1964.
&gt;  Finally, VW in Wolfsburg received my 10Dm and returned a certificate saying
&gt;  that it was
&gt;  built on 16th December 1964 and left the factory 6 days later on the 22nd.
&gt;  
&gt;  How the hell can this be? - the chassis number says it's a late '65, the
&gt;  registration
&gt;  plate says it's a '65. So who's wrong? and do I now just give up as
&gt;  everyone that should
&gt;  know the facts disagree with each other, and all seem to be a year out?
&gt;  
&gt;  Any light shed would be gratefully received.
&gt;  
&gt;  Thanks,
&gt;  Paul Edwards.

Hi Paul,

I'm copying this to the list so that a major thread doesn't start and we can 
educate the rest of the world as to how to change vehicle details in the UK.

It would seem that as you have a splitty bus (ie two square windows at the 
front) it is definitelty not a 1970s bus as suggested by your V5 keepers 
document.

Because the DVLA try to keep things simple they go by year of registration 
for manufactured year which means it's often wrong especially on vehicles 
which have been imported from overseas sometime after their original 
manufacture.

The manufacture date as supplied by VW is in full agreement with you chassis 
number. The production year for 1965 began 1 August 1964 and ended 31 July 
1965 so a vehicle manufactured 16/18 Dec 64 is a 1965 model year bus NOT a 
1964.

as second digit is a 3 then it is a Kombi which came with or without rear 
seats so Kombi seven seater is probably correct.

So what do you do to change your V5 Keepers document, go to the Post Office 
and get the form for changing vehicle details and after filling it in send it 
along with photocopies of the letter and certificate from VW to the DVLC and 
they will change the keepers certificate to correct the year of manufacture.

The corrected year of manufacture will also allow you to get &quot;Historic 
Vehicle&quot; Road Tax exemption.

If your Kombi has been converted to a camper van then it is well worth 
changing the description to &quot;Motor Caravan&quot; at the same time - taking a 
vehicle registered as a Kombi 7 seater (ie a minibus) over the Severn Bridge 
Toll will cost £7.40 (if you are honest) while a motor caravan costs £4.80.
I have been to places where there are parking restrictions or higher charges 
for Minibuses than campervans too.

Good luck
