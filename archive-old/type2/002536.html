Sorry I should have specified. My previous email was a question on the =
charging system. Yes my red light does come on when the key is on. I =
have the idiots book and went through the trouble shooting. One thing =
that I am missing is my red light does not illuminate but the battery is =
not charging. I checked the voltage out of the regulator on the 61 =
terminal and it is good. I have not checked the gen. itself by =
disconnecting the DF and D- wires and ground the D- (hayes manual). My =
question is would the regulator be the cause of the battery not =
charging???? Also the engine dies when I pull the negative cable. (Brand =
new battery)

Thanks again.,
Paul Saulsbury
