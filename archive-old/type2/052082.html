To All;

All your points are well taken, but...

You can walk into any variety, discount store, or FLAPS in N. America and
buy a T-shirt or keychain or floormat with the Chevrolet, Ford, Honda, etc.
logo on it.  Yet when was the last time you heard of GM, FoMoCo, Honda, etc.
taking legal action against the suppliers of those logoed items?

GM, FoMoCo, etc. operate under exactly the same copyright/trademark laws as
Volkswagen of America.  Their legal staffs are at least as large and
expensive.  Despite those realities, they do not seem the least bit
concerned about &quot;protecting&quot; their copyrights/trademarks.

You may very well reply that GM is an enormous and well-established,
worldwide, corporation, and accordingly considers it's position &quot;safe&quot;.
That argument just doesn't hold water.  Volkswagen is nearly equal in size
and worldwide influence.

So why is VWoA freaking out over something that similar corporate giants
consider insignificant?  Have they really become that institutionally
paranoid?  I'm convinced there's more behind VWoA's search and destroy
mission than &quot;just&quot; protection of copyright/trademark rights.  Think about
it.....
