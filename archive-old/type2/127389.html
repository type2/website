Subject: Re: [T2] decoding microfiche: VW pn's

Thanks, but the picture doesn't show the nut &amp; washer used to hold the
bracket to the case. Scott Lyons indicated that the nut is a M6 and the
washer is one of those wavy lockwasher types. Did I mention how much I
appreciate your site? Your pictures made the cool air flap install this
weekend _much_ easier, dare I say made the install possible.
So, the nut I'm looking for would be 211-119-7? I'm confused. I took
the library page you linked, and had it side-by-side with the fiche for
the flywheel, etc section (image 04) to figure out how VW got to 271 as
the last 3 numbers. The flywheel looks like its number 18 in the fiche.
how does 18 relate to 271? I understand the 211 and 105 portions. Its
the 271 segment of the number that I don't get. If I can get my brain
around the 18=271, than I'll be able to id any other part.
Thanks!

&gt; The fiche tries to organize the parts by the part number system: main
&gt; group and sub group.

&gt; 
&gt; The fiche is further divided into illustrations with are numbered and
&gt; items are numbered within each illustration. Those two locating
&gt; systems are only used to match the depicted item in the illustration
&gt; to a part number in the list for that illustration.
