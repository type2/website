Subject: Re: [T2] Pass Smog Forever

&gt; Here's a little tip from the Hillbilly State.
&gt;
&gt; Arkansas requires neither smog nor safety inspections. All you California
&gt; people have to do is re-register your vehicles in Arkansas and you are home
&gt; free!! Renewing your registration can be done via the mail. I don't know how
&gt; stringent they are in your proving residency status.
&gt;
&gt; Just a thought. I keep reading posts from folks agonizing over their smog
&gt; inspection woes.

Maybe we can buy a little shotgun shack and register all of our busses
there. Insurance is bound to be cheaper too.
