Subject: Pinging or knocking?

Hi there,

We just came back from a holiday in Normandy  France. Our 468-camper did
very well, though on way back to Belgium we heard a deep snoring sound
coming from under the bus which we could not trace. We can only hear it when
releasing the accelerating pedal a little bit and it seems to be strongest
driving at about 90 km/h (60 mph?) in 4th gear. We do not hear the sound at
lower speeds, nor when the engine is idling.
I hope it4s not the sound you call pinging or knocking Can someone
describe me this particular sound? And if this is pinging, how bad is it
when we were driving with it for about 100 km?
I asked this before but had confusing answers so; I have set the valves at
0.15, dwell angle reads 500 exact and I have timed the engine at 7.50 before
TDP, vacuum connected, is this timing ok? It4s a 1600 engine with single
carburetor and engine number AD 362351



Bart
