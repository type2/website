Subject: burnt rotor

http://www.geocities_dot_com/warrenbaity/burntrotor.jpg

well thats a picture of my rotor right after getting a tuneup from a 
professional shop!! Maybe about 10 miles at the most. I wasnt sure about 
them from the start. But my questionn is is it there fault. Does this just 
happen or is it because of the &quot;tuneup&quot;? I know that the picture isnt that 
clear, but my digital camera isnt the best. oh and what causes this to 
happen? timing set wrong?? I was thinking that it might be set wrong because 
i was doing the dipstick test where you try to hold the dipstick and it was 
pretty hot and i couldnt really hold it at first. But then again maybe i 
have wussy hands. who knows. anyhow if you guys could get back to me on this 
soon i would appriciate it. I dont want to start a big commotion with the 
shop before i know for sure. Thanks

Joey
