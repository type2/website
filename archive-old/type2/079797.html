Subject: The Exorcism

They said I was crazy and I fully expect to be excommunicated from 
NEATO and the Vintagebus list but  I sold the 67 bus. The new owner 
picked it up this morning. I promptly bummed a ride from the SO over 
to Chad's place to pick up my new ride - 1968 Adventurewagen.   It is 
really a neat bus and I am looking forward to making it the new daily 
driver.

The 68 will be getting a fresh motor in the near future. In the mean 
time I have set to the task getting the rest of the bus in daily 
driver mode. Phase one will include the obligatory exercising of the 
wiring demons. I cannot seem to buy a bus without having to f around 
with all the electricals :)

So far I have fixed the tail lights, turn signals, dash lights and 
high beams. Still to be dealt with is the strange case of left front 
turn signal circuit opening up and staying open when the brake pedal 
is pushed. A review of the Holy Bentley wiring diagram reveals that 
there is some direct association between the brake light switches and 
the flasher relay. Tomorrow I will pull the pedal pan and lay hands 
upon the brake switches.

I enlisted the Stella the helpful 1st grader to push the pedal while 
I examined the beast. Just as a reality check can anyone confirm that 
the turn signal should be the thicker and therefore brighter of the 
two filaments in the bulb? Just and added piece of minutia : the left 
brake light comes on a split second after the right one.

There is also the case of the ghostly parking light indicator light 
in the instrument cluster. It glows ever so faintly all the time. The 
spooky part there is no circuit 57 on the headlight switch and I am 
not sure where it is getting power from. The left turn signal 
indicator also glows faintly but does flash when it is supposed to . 
The right is dead as a doornail. There may be a connection.

Neat stuff about the bus.

68 buses have green oil pressure lights and red gen lights. The door 
locks are have pull up knobs and the door handles are like late 
splitscreen buses.

This bus is a tourist delivery vehicle and has the dealership badge 
from the Dealer in Frankfurt Germany. The bumpers have deluxe trim 
like most Euro spec buses. After a tour of Europe the bus was shipped 
to Long Beach, Ca to be turned into an Adventurewgon and the driven 
back to North Carolina. Some dirt hippies got ahold of the bus and it 
was on tour for a while and ended up back in NC. It was driven for a 
while and then parked in the fellows back yard for a few years when 
Chad spotted it.

When Chad got the bus it was in poor shape and he did a great job 
getting lots of mechanical stuff in working order. The A-wagen 
interior was in sad and mostly unusable shape so he did a beautiful 
job of putting in all new interior panels. It looks quite shippy!

Thanks to Chad for passing the bus on to me. I look forward to seeing 
Chad the the 69 single cab on the road soon!
