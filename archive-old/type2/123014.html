Subject: [T2] Side Vent Window Frames

&gt; I have a newly acquired '74 Micro... Just spent the weekend tearing it
 apart for a resto and found some unsalvageable parts.  I have vent
 windows in both the driver's rear window sections which are very rusted
 at the bottom.  I need the frame to bus and the frame to glass, are
 these only available used?  Any suggestions on where to find them?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

As mentioned by Karl and others these windows are very hard to find in any
sort of decent working order. My 78' Westy has a rusted out one on the
driver's side rear. Instead of trying to find a decent replacement I am
going to replace the glass with the full sized glass from the right side.
The openings on both sides are the same size so the glass and seal from a
right side full window will fit. I dont really have much use for the vent
window there anyway having jealousy windows (sp?) BTW does anyone know the
correct spelling for these windows? I tried dictionary_dot_com to no avail.
