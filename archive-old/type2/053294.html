&gt;&gt; found a cool LCD TV ($1000)

&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; I happen to work for a large computer company that uses small LCD screens as
&gt; part of the manufacturing process. Since we order the screens directly from
&gt; the manufacturer as a spare part, I know ~we~ pay $300 for the 6 inch
&gt; screen. It comes with the rca plugs and everything, just need to build a
&gt; &quot;housing&quot; to mount it in. Unfortunately, I don't have the means to purchase
&gt; anything through my company. Even at $300 its a little steep for me. I would
&gt; guess over time these units will drop drastically just like VCR's have.
&gt; 
&gt; Bus content: I recently scored new &quot;arms&quot; for controlling the vents and
&gt; heat. I have yet to pull the four screws holding the dash on, is there
&gt; anything I should know before I go for it?

Apple Computer makes a beautiful 22 inch flat panel display that works VERY
well for watch wide screen DVDs. It costs as much as I plan to pay for my
bus.
