Subject: A new engine?

Hi, I'm Nikki, the owner of a 1970 bus in excellent condition. I'm told
she needs a valve job, and, all engine things considered, it's time to
get a new one.

I hear there are some craftsperson rebuilders out there; as well as
engine-rebuilders to avoid. If I had another liftetime I'd love to learn
to do this, but me and the kids and the big bad dogs need our bus now! 
We also need a bus/mechanic guru. 

I live in Santa Monica, CA, but would be willing to travel to
neighboring cities.  My only limit is this engine!

Thanks,

Nikki
