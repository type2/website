Subject: luggage rack bushing replacement

FYI
 When I redid my luggage rack I had good luck replacing the back =
bushings with parts from Napa.  For the 2 outside I used part # 650-1110 =
and for the middle one I used part # 650-1113.  I also replaced the =
screws with new stainless steel ones that are about a 1/4 in longer than =
the original.  I've had no leaks or problems so far.
