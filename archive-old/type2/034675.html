+AD4-Hi,
+AD4-
+AD4-Just bought my '68 Westy and it has a three band radio in it which we found
+AD4-rather odd although this may not be? The third band doesn't seem to pick up
+AD4-anything at all and the bands are labeled U, L and M. I have the schematic
+AD4-in the manuals I got with my camper.
+AD4-
+AD4-Can anyone tell me what this third band is for?
+AD4-
+AD4-Thanks,
+AD4-Jen
+AD4-'68 Westy


I believe the three letters stand for UHF (ultra high frequency), Long wave
and Medium wave.

The long wave and medium wave bands are both AM bands (amplitude modulated),
we still use them in Europe, though not so much these days, and the UHF will
I presume be a short wave band.

UHF is in the range 300-3000 megahertz and is used mainly for television and
I think some kinds of communication, like emergency services.
