Subject: Re: [T2] vw rubber floor mats

Hi,

Ronnie from www.type2parts_dot_com is now selling repro floor mats for 
bays and splits. The molds for the mats were made from NOS floor 
mats. Unlike others that have been available in the past, these have 
the correct waffling on the underside. I doubt they are cheap but 
Ronnie has a good rep for selling quality stuff.

&gt;Hello all, what is a good price for a set of floor mats.  The rubber on my
&gt;74 is torn and sections are missing.  If anyone has any for less than below
&gt;let me know.
