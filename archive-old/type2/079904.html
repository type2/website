	Bus content - anyone currently use American Collectors Insurance for
their 
	bus?  They only want $51/year to insure a $3,000 bus (agreed value)
with no 
	deductible, $300k liability, comp, collision, etc. and the only
restriction 
	is that it not be a daily driver and no more than 2500 miles per 
	year.  Maybe I can afford to keep a second bus after all... ?

I checked on this, and it is not offered in my home state, MA. Does anyone
know of a service like this available in Massachusetts?
