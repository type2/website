Subject: RE: [T2] Rear engine VW

Just eyeballing the rear apron space, I think a flat four would fit nicely
there. Perhaps they will source Subaru or will we see a 4 cylinder Porsche
Boxster/Cayman motor shared in the next 914 revival.

I hope it is a gas/oil burner. Doesn't look to be enough room for a hybrid
unless Porsche/VW has some serious tricks up their sleeve. I'll buy one just
for my commute for the drive train layout AND a very nicely styled
interior/exterior.

If Walter de' Silva can do for the bus what he did for the R8, I'm  
excited. Here's crossing my fingers the up! makes it across the pond.
