Hi Volks,

Been watching the Bus Depot saga this past 2 days, and decided to jump in
with my experience.

I ordered parts this spring from Bus Depot, and got my order faster than
promised. Everything important was there, and the quality of the parts was
good despite the price being very low. The only (minor) disappointment was
the missing catalog, and I'll be asking for that to be included in my next
order. I also got the list-member discount.

The Toll-free tel# wasn't an issue for me, as most US retailers don't have
international toll-free lines anyway. That's what email is for. If you're in
a hurry, be a grown-up and open your wallet! It's free enterprise, pure and
simple.

Because I had a deadline, (EB2001)  I ordered one critical part (windshield
seal) from a local VW specialist who had it in stock. It arrived 4 days
later than the Bus Depot order, even though it had been ordered 20 minutes
sooner. And I paid as much for shipping than I did for the larger order from
Bus Depot. 

My FLAPS (Canadian Tire) can supply me with plug wires for a t4 motor, but I
have to wait for them to special order, *and* then pony up more than double
what Ron charges for Bosch parts, including shipping. My tune-up can wait a
week or two for that kinda coin.

That's my $.02, YMMV.

Happy trails,

Greg Potts
