Ever had a day when the littke things get ya down...

Got the bus all paced up and ready to head across the river...  
stoped to fill the tank and noticed the ol dreadfull puffs of smoke 
rolling from the left side...  peaked up under the skirt and shure 
enough...  drips from the valve covers...  well back at the house 
searched for the spare gaskets I was sure I have... well, cant find 
em...  none in stock in any of the FLAPS around... so I guess its a 
bust...  will just have to drive out in the non VW and see the sites...

After I go back into the garage and tear it apart...
