Hey all,
  I found a small bag of rubber boots in my Bus when I got it and I am
triing to find out what they go to. The part # on the bag is 211 405 375.
They are genuine VW and new. They look like a little bellow, 2in Dia. at one
end and 3/4in hole in the other, about 1in long. I have 4 of them and have
no idea what they go to. Could they be for the shift tube?
