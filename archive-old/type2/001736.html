Subject: Steering Wheel Removal / Ignition Switch

Any ideas on how to get the wheel off, without the proper tools?

Another question, I have posted troubles with a wire meltdown.  Seems I have
it narrowed down to the thicker black, must be a hot going to the ignition
switch, through a T connector to the fuse box.  So, is this wire built into
the ignition switch, needing a different switch, or can it be replaced?
Thank You
Frank
