Subject: RE:  Parts Interchange - 68 thru 79 Bus
Date: Fri, 12 Mar 1999 13:57:13 -0600

&gt;O.K.  checked the archives ..again..still haven't found anything
&gt;definitive....to all those knowledgable about these
&gt;things...is there a reference manual  or info anywhere
&gt;on parts compatability/interchange  between
&gt;68 thru 79 buses.???????

I usually turn to one of the parts catalogs like RMMW.  They've got all the
parts listed and what year/model they're for.  Acts as a great
cross-reference.
