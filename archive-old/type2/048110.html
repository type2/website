Subject: [T2] mystery short?

Hello List,

Can anyone spare a minute for an electrical question?  After replacing the 
alternator in my 80 Westy, the batteries (new) continue to get weaker.  
Yesterday I noticed the oil pressure light and parking brake light flickering 
in unison during hard downhill braking/stopping.  Could this be the short 
I've been searching for???  These two lights don't appear to have anything in 
common on the electrical diagram...any suggestions?

Thanks,
Craig Brewer
