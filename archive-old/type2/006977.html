Gentlepersons-
                       Although not specifically type 2 (at the moment), I 
thought we owners of
chronologically-challenged cars would be interested. Ron, of Bus Depot fame, 
any news/
rumours along these lines?
  
Many UK spares companies will refuse to do business with US customers because 
of the 
risk of being sued for product liability in the event of an accident. This 
may sound ab-
surd when we are talking about light lenses but if a company has a policy of 
not dealing
with the US it is easier to have blanket ban than pick and choose products. 
The problem
is insurance. In Europe product liability is now becoming a hot issue. 
Insurance compan-
ies will quote either a totally absurd premium for dealing with the US or 
simply impose a
blanket restriction...
Some other companies, even in Europe, now put performance disclaimers on all 
their pro-
ducts but I am advised that these have no legal value whatsoever.
Many people, including me, believe that the biggest single threat to the 
historic vehicle
movement in the future, certainly in europe, and probably elsewhere, is 
punitive legis-
lation on product liability for spares.
Autojumblers beware.
