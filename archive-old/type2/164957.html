Subject: Re: [T2] Bumper replacement

I think your plan sounds awesome.

I had a stock hitch and I sold it, ridiculous looking contraption, I plan to do something like you are.

I had also thought about cutting a square out of the existing bumper and putting the receiver through it and then reinforcing behind it, maybe add some plate inside the stock bumper for strength.

My idea is so grand that if it is ever done it will be years after you have started enjoying yours.
