Subject: Kick Panels
Message-ID: &lt;376D4885.70DCD658_at_bellsouth_dot_net&gt;

This is my second try at making the kick panels in my 74 Transporter
look good.  The first try was to strip and recover the old kick panels.
I used new black vinyl and Parabond M-286 Foam &amp; fabric Adhesive.  It
stayed put for a while then the vinyl began to peal off.  The adhesive
never hardened.  I also had made a new panel for the sliding door (it
looked great) now the vinyl is coming off it too.

So this time I cut new kick panels out of a scrape piece of tile board.
I bought the damaged sheet at Lowes for 8$.  Placed the tile side to the
front of the bus and covered the other side with black vinyl, the kind
used to make pickup bed covers.  This time I used Misty, foam and fabric
spray adhesive.  The tile board is much stronger then the plain pressed
paper panels and will bend more without breaking.  If this adhesive
holds, I should know for sure by the end of Aug.  I will make and cover
a new sliding door panel.
