The the wire from the ignition switch, condenser wire from coil, or red and
black wires from coil (electronic ignition), were probably crossed.  I had a
friend who helped me work on my bus and even with years of experience he
accidently switched the wires and fried my Pertronix.  Puff, puff and $60
down the tubes.  It was an expensive lesson, but I pay much closer attention
now.  Not sure what you mean by &quot;replace the distributor&quot; but its unlikely
any serious damage was done.  Coil should be fine, but you obviously need to
replace the points or condenser depending on which wire was fried.  Good
luck.

&gt;Hi Everybody,
 
&gt;I have a 71 volkwagen bus, just got done tearing the
&gt;engine completley down to replace a weber carbrator
&gt;with a stock solex.  
&gt;   when I went to start the engine it cranked but
&gt;never turned over, I went back and saw smoke coming
&gt;from my distributor!  looked inside and the insulated
&gt;cable was fried.  what happened?
&gt;I realize that I will need to replace the distributor
&gt;but I don't want the same thing to happen with the new
&gt;one.  Any Ideas?
            Nick Moran
