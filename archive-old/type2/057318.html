I previously posted:

&lt;&lt;I'm getting ready to order up another batch of Carver P4 propane heaters
from
England.  Any list members interested P-mail me for details.  Or, check out
information posted at http://members.aol_dot_com/thingguy/carver.html&gt;&gt;

If you e-mail me from the link on my web page, I won't know your on one of the
VW lists, and you won't be quoted the discount price.

If you want pricing information, and the list discount, please reply to me
from this message.

Thanks,
