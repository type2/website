Subject: The doors on the bus don't lock sometimes....

The doors on my van are giving me grief at the moment. Not bad grief but
enough.

Drivers side: Shut the door, turn the key and sometimes it locks. Sometimes
you have to turn the key 2 or 3 times for it to lock. I have raised the
door on it's hinges as I thought it might just have slipped down with use
but no change. Seems to shut OK apart from this although I still suspect
that shutting it is causing it to climb on the latch slightly (latch on
pillar adjusted all the way down). Getting worse very slowly as it used to
take 2 turns to guarantee a lock but now sometimes takes 3.

Passenger side: Shut the door, turn the key and it locks. 100% of the time.
BUT if you try the door by pulling the catch you can't unlock it with the
key. Leave it alone and you can.

Sliding door: No clearance under door for the alloy threshold plate. Bob
Wallace pointed me in the direction of the spacers that go between the door
and the front bottom support. I've got four in but can I use more ? How
many do other people have in there ? It shuts reasonably (no worse than
anyone else's) but I better it was better when the bus was new.

Ashley is a 1971 UK Doormobile. All significant rust has been eradicated
and the cab doors are two year old Brazilian (I think), definitely genuine
VW.

Thanks for any suggestions.

Phil
