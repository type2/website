My personal oppion from simialr experiences is that its not worth the
damage to use the tar based sound proofing techniques,  any modifications
that are easily undone , imo, are potential disasters,  whats going to
happen if we ( i made the mistake of using the &quot;cool patch&quot; garbage in my
bus) need to do body wpork in the future. are we going to somewhow scrape
all of this stuff off? thats not a very appealing thought, i have t4ried
to remove small amounts of it to no avail.   Essentially it is linig your
bus with a sticky goey runny mess that will forever get stuck on anything
that touches it and forever be a hinderance to repairs.  I kick myself
whenever i think of what i  did to my bus, i must have devalued it by 2
grand.  Dynamat, which i have used on many cars, is somewhat less
destructive BUT after a few years can become a pita to remove as well.  i
do like the use of carpet padding as it can gbe easily removed for repairs
and is effective. i guess my point is just that there are serious trade
offs to consider when trying to &quot;sound proof &quot; a bus, and that they should
all be weighed,  is it nice to have a quiet bus? definetly, am i glad i
did what i did, absolutley not. 
good luck whatever path you choose
