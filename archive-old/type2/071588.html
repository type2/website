Subject: My new exciting bus feature....
Message-ID: &lt;e50b2f1b.249bb4e6_at_aol_dot_com&gt;

hey all....
just thought i'd add in my exciting bus feature not found on many 
cars...(besides its wonderous ability to purge itself of used oil..!!)...is 
that vw designed these to rarely get a speeding ticket.  here in nebraska the 
interstate is 75mph.  you have to be doing at least 80-85 to get pulled over. 
 and honestly what trooper is gonna think a bread box on wheels is doing 
85+??  which i know many of our buses will climb past the 80 mark with 
ease.....but i rarely hold it there.   maybe i ought to write vw a letter 
thanking them for removing the fear of state troopers on the road.  i never 
have to hit brakes when i see one...........( oh ya and i get to enjoy more 
scenery at slower speeds thus causing me to have a better outlook on my day, 
enjoying the sights of the land around me!!)....wow, and you all thought you 
got a bus 'cuz it was practical.........

have a good weekend all.....
