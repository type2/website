Subject: Re: max safe cylinder head temps

Joe:

I've experienced the same anxiety as you over cylinder head 
temperatures.  I have a '79 completely stock westy with new AMC heads.  
When I installed the AMCs I also installed the VDO CHT gauge with 
sensor under #3 cylinder.  I was seeing 500 degrees at 60 mph on a 75 
degree day.  Needless to say this really freaked me out after spending 
$850 on my heads and taking a great deal to time to set compression 
correctly.  I've since concluded that either these temperatures either 
normal or the gauge is not terribly accurate.  I used a sophisticated 
Raytek infrared heat sensor to measure head temperature at #3 spark 
plug and got around 420 when the VDO read 500. Lots of people told me 
that the Raytek number was bogus die to emissivity issues etc.   I also 
screwed around with air fuel mixture.  When I enriched the mixture to 
get the 60 mph CHT under 400 I was getting less than 8 mpg and the bus 
ran like crap at idle.

So far I've put over 4000 miles on these heads and compression remains 
good.  My recommendations are to use the VDO CHT as a trend indicator 
only.
