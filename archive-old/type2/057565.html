&gt; Now that I know that my wall

&gt; cigarette lighter nor a &quot;silver socket&quot; for easily hooking into
this.  Can
&gt; anybody tell me how I can go about hooking up a 12V gizmo in the bus

You have to create an entry point.

I had to do this to support my amateur radio habit.  It's not hard at
all.  All you need to do is run a wire from the positive terminal of
your battery (actually, it's more convenient to start where the fat
positive cable connects to the starter.  Use a ring terminal under the
same nut that holds the cable) to wherever you need power.

I'd recommend that you use a hefty 10ga wire and be _sure_ to fuse it
at the battery end.  Use a 20A or 30A fuse and an in-line fuse holder.
 Run the wire under the bus and come up through the floor either next
to an existing wire bundle or through a hole of your own.  If you use
your own hole be sure to put a grommet in the hole to prevent short
circuits.

For a outlet you have your choice of many different connectors.  I use
Molex connectors for my radios, but you might want to use a standard
cigarette lighter outlet as most 12V accessories use this kind of
plug, even though it is kind of klunky.  You can also use the standard
VW silver socket which I've heard can be had at farm equipment dealers
in the US.
