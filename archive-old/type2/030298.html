&gt; Hey Volks-
&gt; I'm having a problem locating tires for my '77 Westy.  They have '185 SR 14' 
&gt; on the existing ones, and no one seems to have these in stock.  
&gt; Unfortunately I had a blow out this morning, and have to get these ASAP.  
&gt; Any suggestions on where to go?

Go to your local Firestone/Bridgestone outlet and asked for RD603V in
185R14 Load range D.  They sometimes have them in stock and if they don't
they can get them in a day or two.

Above all, don't let the immediate need for a tire leave you open to a
tire dealers' claim that a 195/75R14 is &quot;the same&quot; as the correct 185R14.
Get the proper size and you (and your bus) will be much happier.
