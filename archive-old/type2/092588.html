&gt;Hello my fine feathered type 4 friends,
&gt;
&gt;I finally finished dismantling my old engine from my vanagon.
&gt;I got the fan off, and the fan housing, but there is a funky
&gt;thing with the three holes for bolts and a little dowel sticking
&gt;out.  This was what the fan was screwed in to.  I'm guessing it
&gt;is some kind of circlip thing, but I am not able to remove it.

That is the fan hub, and it will be on there very tightly.  I was unable to 
remove it, in fact I bent the &quot;ears&quot; trying to remove it with a 
puller.  Ended up having to take the crank into a machine shop to have it 
pressed off.
