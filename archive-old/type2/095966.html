That sounds very generous............You should but it on ebay in the fall
and donate the proceeds...right now they do not bring much $$$ in the
summer...........

Subject: [T2] gas heater


I pulled a gas heater (BN4 I think) out of my 71 westy and would like to
raffle/donate it to the list.  Proceeds could either go to the list or to
the Kristie Laurite fund.  I think it has all the parts, duct work and I
would ship it to who ever wants it or send it to one of the gatherings for a
raffle.  This was a factory installed unit and has the fire wall cut out
with it.  Anyone interested
