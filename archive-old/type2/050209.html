That sounds correct.  I just envision a barrel nut with two bolts sticking out of it, and remember which way to go to make the bolt unscrew out of it (always counterclockwise).

Subject: 

&gt; brakes.  Which adjusting star do I turn upwards
&gt; and which one do I turn downwards (left of right)
&gt; to take up the slack from my wearing shoes?
&gt;

on the passenger side it's front down and back up and the drivers side is
reversed if I remember correctly.

Any confirmation on this?
Peace,
