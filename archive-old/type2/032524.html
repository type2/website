Subject: RE: Steering Wheel Position

The steering box MUST be at it's center point when driving straight ahead and 
properly adjusted.  See discussion of this in Bentley.

There is a designed in &quot;tight spot&quot; (for lack of a better term) in the 
steering box, located at the center point of it's travel.  Even a brand new 
and accurately adjusted steering box will have slack/play in the steering 
wheel on either side of this center point.

Steering box adjustment must be made with the box centered on this &quot;tight 
spot&quot;.  Doing otherwise will damage the unit immediately, and can even cause 
the box to seize as you attempt to steer.  This is definitely a VERY BAD 
THING!  

Even if it doesn't seize, the improperly adjusted internals will quickly be 
damaged by being forced to turn through the &quot;tight spot&quot; and you'll be back in 
the market for a new/rebuilt steering box.

These units are too expensive, and too much of a hassle to replace, to risk 
damage due to incorrect adjustment.  I don't always agree with the Bentley 
manual, but in this instance you ignore it's instructions at your peril.
