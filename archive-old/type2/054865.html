Subject: Thanks from Steve's Lock Shoppe

Thanks, guys, for the glowing comments. I appreciate it.  Incidentally, if
you are going to need lock work done and will be at Busses byt the Arch, I
will have my shop set up there.  I'll be with the Houston crowd in a brown
Vanagon Westy.  Hope to see you there.
