Subject: Part 2 of Alternator Wiring questions

As I was writing my last message, I thought that the d-, d+ and df looked
familiar. Sure enough, the wires coming out of my OLD alternator had the
same markings, in the same order! Then I looked on the box that the new
alternator came in and it said that my new alternator had a built in
voltage regulator! What's going on here? It looks like a very simple
&quot;connect the wires&quot; procedure, but this whole voltage regulator thing has
me all confused. Unless somone tells me not to, I'm just gonna wire it
like I did the old alternator. Could running two voltage regulators hurt
anything? HELP!
