Subject: Installing an engine hatch
Mime-Version: 1.0

I have a 1971 Riviera Pop Top. I used to have a 1974 bus. It had an hatch 
to gain access to the engine compartment. The 1971 does not. Would it be 
feasible to cut one from a later model bus and weld it into my bus? Has 
anyone ever done this?
