Subject: Re: helpin' hippies

Hi Bill

On 06/05/04, you wrote:

&gt; Oh yeah, he wants to pay me for any time/tools/equipment in
&gt; Chocolate that'll &quot;blow my mind&quot;, semi-precious stones, and other
&gt; trinkets.
&gt; He's trying desperately to land the vehicle at my house for
&gt; undisclosed periods of time,

That part would make me question motives, big time!

Anyone looking to crash their vehicle for repairs or otherwise on your
property is probably looking for more.

From a guy who came of age in the 70's are the &quot;Rainbow people&quot;
just another name for classical 60's hippies or is there something
more unseemly here?


Sincerely,
