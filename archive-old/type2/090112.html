Subject: Re: [T2]  bus  buying question 

I want to thank everyone for their input. it is really
helpful. i guess it would be a better deal for me to
buy a bus that already has it's bits and pieces in
tact. I didn't know about the title thing. i'm pretty
green on buying and owning a car... this will be my
first car and i have wanted a vw bus, sinc ei saw the
mystery machine on scooby doo... back when i was still
a young pup... so i'm really looking hard at finding
my bus. any suggestions on where i should look? oh
yeah, i live in Southern California. there are
actually a couple of vw shops right in my
neighborhood... which is really nice, so if i have any
probs i can go to them. any suggestions/ advice is
greatly appreciated. i want to make an educated
decision (purchase), so all input is well taken.
thanks.

Miesha

p.s. Ronnie can you email me the info on the bus that
you are selling?? thanks.
