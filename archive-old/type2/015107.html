Subject: Speakers and Rear Panel Carpet
Message-Id: &lt;3.0.3.32.19990410200554.007b2590_at_pop.conknet_dot_com&gt;

	FYI just installed new speakers in the front door panels of my '71 and the
Kenwood 1066 4.5 inchers were a perfect fit - no cutting or drilling required.

	Also I purchased the speaker box carpet from Crutchfield to redo my rear
deck carpet and side panels.  19.95 for 3 yards about 60 inches wide. I
used charcoal but comes in Black and Blue as well.   Is the correct
thickness and cuts great.  I used the stock side panels but cut a new deck
panel from 1/8 inch tempered masonite which cut easily with my jigsaw. 

	Stretched the carpet down on some plywood and then used 3M spray trim
adhesive.   Drilled all the mounting holes and everything went in
perfectly.  Also did the front kick panels .  I just peeled off the stock
black vinyl ( the 3M adhesive doesn't work good on smooth vinyl) and then
layed the panels over the strectched carpet after spraying the adhesive on
both the carpet and panel.  Then I just traced the panel edge with a good
sharp utility knife and did the cutouts and then another perfect panel.  

	I was careful to remove the original Wasser Pressure label from the
original panel and simply appied the label to the new panel with a little
spray adhesive. 

	Looks like it came from the factory that way.  I like the look of the
carpet material better than the black vinyl and I'm sure it will hold up
better.  

	If you cut careful, you can do the entire back area behind the rear seat
and the front kick panels from one 3 yard roll.  All told I spent about
$30.00 nto do the whole project.  The 4X 8 foot masonite cost $8.00 so if
you use the old rear deck floor board and the original side panels you're
talking around $20.

	My middle side panels had become warped from the old leaking vent windows
I believe.  I wanted to keep the stock two tone vinyl panel material so I
simply peeled the cloth backed vinyl from the warped boards and made new
boards out of the 1/8 inch tempered masonite and used the old panel as a
template to drill all of the mounting holes.  The side panel opposite the
sliding door only required 2 easy cuts.  I then stretched the old vinyl on
some plywood and stapled it down on the edge.  Then applied the new board
to the vinyl using the fold line along the edge as a guide to line it up.
Worked great.
