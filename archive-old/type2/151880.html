Subject: Re: [T2] An article from globeandmail_dot_com

Guys,

While I didn't seethe reference tothe original article, I did see/read an 
item last week where VW had sent a team of &quot;engineers&quot; into the states to 
see what it actually *is* that Americans want in a car.

Their conclusion?....wait for it!


Americans want to do everything in a car except drive it.

Eat, drink, watch TV, talk on the phone, put on makeup, shave,
comb/brush hair ...etc.

Their second conclusion was that they were no drivers left that actually 
wanted to *drive* their cars.  A conclusion that I suspect matched their
market group.  They did apparently attend some &quot;local&quot; swaps and car 
shows.


So, they decided to make cars that match what the American market wants
a car for.....and extension of your living room.

I don't guess I will be buying one of those either....

Cheers, dave

 &gt; I read down to the vehicles stats.  VW seems to never learn.  Leather
&gt; seats,

 &gt; It doesn't sound like it's going to be affordable. :O(
 &gt;
 &gt;    VW isn't playing to the cheap seats anymore...It doesn't
 want to be associated with the likes of Kia or any of the
 &quot;entry level&quot; car companies...The Phaeton is the type of
 car VW would prefer to sell. A VW mini van can't be cheap
 if VW is to control its upscale image...
