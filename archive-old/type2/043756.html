Ok, first will be a little about the bus, then will be
the question:

The bus was bought in Switzerland and used for 10
people to travel around Europe... Ouch. Then was
brought back to the US because it couldn't be sold due
to the Oil Embargo.  It was then used in Colorado for
15 years till 1982 as a daily driver and for trips,
then taken here, Madison, WI, where it was used for
trips.  It's whole life in America it has been
garaged, however, the frame is still badly
deteriorated due to rust, and parts of the steering
are unrecognizable and it is not at all safe to drive
faster than 25 mph.  It has numerous parts replaced
numerous times.  It has also had it's whole life
recorded in 3 books.  (quite a story) I bought it
thinking i might be able to drive it, then realized it
will just be a parts van for my 72' restoration
project. 70,000 original miles.

The question I have is which clutch i should use if I
do decide to put the new 1600 engine in my 72'?  Will
both of them work? Because my 72' has the original
clutch 70K, and the 71' has a newer clutch.  Also, the
engine tin in the 71' is in wonderful shape, so can I
cut that out, and weld it in place of the one i have
now, or would it just be easier to buy the adapter
I've been told about?

Thanks again
