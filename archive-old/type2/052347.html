Subject: [T2] accelerator pedal

I was about to install my new accelerator pedal this weekend and ran into a 
problem...

My old one has a &quot;switch&quot; that is engaged by a spring on the bottom of 
it.  The switch has a black with green stripe wire to it and a white wire.

Is this for the automatic transmission?  I couldn't find it anywhere on my 
wiring diagrams.  When I ordered the pedal (Bus Depot) I didn't see a 
different listing for automatic trans.

I can get the switch assembly off of the old one, but the new pedal is 
missing the a hole in the top for the switch and the center pivot point on 
the original is longer.

I have a 1975 Westy (auto tranny) with a 1978 engine that was converted 
from FI to single carb.  Do I still need this switch?  Should I drill out 
the holes needed in the new one?  Do these pants make me look fat?

Thanks everyone..

Missy:)
