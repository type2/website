Nice Insult John.  The majority of your letter made some valid points but
when you start off insulting the other person I'm not sure that helps you
make your point.

&gt;&gt;  But if they have any balls they
&gt;&gt;should also feel morally obligated to tell how situations are rectified,
&gt;&gt;admit if they were at fault or wrong, and if sensible to give anyone a
&gt;&gt;second chance for an honest mistake.
&gt;&gt;

Good point - but oftentimes the damage is already done to the companies
reputation.  I'm afraid a lot of times the list is used as a sword to
either get back at the person or as a tool to get a quicker response.
