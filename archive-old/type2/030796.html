&gt;I believe they switched to the new VW Eurovan drivetrain
&gt;(originally 4-cyl gasoline, maybe VR6 now) 

Nope, originally offered with a 5-cylinder engine.  The first
transverse-mount five ever offered in a vehicle (and possibly the last)

The older version of this was possibly the one that came with a
Peugeot(maybe Renault?) Diesel engine.  Jeez- what a nightmare that thing
was. (Had friends that owned them, much to their disliking)

The VW models, especially with the new VR6, seem to be good sellers.  I
counted seven on a recent weekend, driving on I40!

I'd still rather drive the Bus.
