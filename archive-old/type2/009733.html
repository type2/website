&gt;As for gauges, I would get them in the following order:

&gt;Oil pressure - most important by a wide margin IMO
&gt;Cylinder Head Temperature
&gt;Oil temperature
&gt;Vacuum
&gt;Battery Voltage (preferably digital)


David, last year you wrote that oil temp was much more important than 
CHT. Now you seem to have reversed yourself. What's up?

By the way, I think that CHT is an ideal candidate for idiot light 
status. Either CHT is 'getting too high' or it's 'okay.' Who cares what 
the actual temp is? (Oil temperature is a different story).
