Subject: Condenser screw

Hi folks...

I'm a clutz, and dropped the screw that holds the condenser to the 
distributor while installing a new condenser tonight.  I felt around 
under the intake air distributor and it wasn't there.  I'm pretty sure 
it fell through the hole in the tin used to access the oil pressure 
sender.

I'm sure I'm not the first person to do this (a show of hands certainly 
would make me feel a little better :-), so I doubt a screw bouncing 
around on top of the crankcase is going to cause any problems.

What I really need to know is: what is the diameter/pitch/length of 
that screw?  I'll need to go pick one up at the hardware store.  It 
looked like it was the same size and pitch as the screw that holds the 
points, and maybe twice the length.

Thanks!
