Subject: el cheapo heat blower hack

it's really freaking cold out today, and i have to drive to vermont later
this afternoon, where it's even colder. when i get there, i'm going to take
advantage of dad's heated garage to thoroughly insulate the main heater
channel and to make sure the flaps are opening correctly. Unfortunately, i
need to get there first. this will be my first trip on a really cold day in
the bus, and all that insulating i did is kinda useless until i can get the
heater blowing more air.

i didn't want to spend the $70 or so on a kit to install an inline blower
right now, because i'm trying to come up with a suitable [read:
non-cardboard] replacement heater channel. so in the mean time, i spent
about an hour last night hacking a primitive dashboard blower system.
here's what i did:

Ingredients:
1 4&quot; 12v computer cooling fan [pulled from a dead hard drive circa 1991]
3 feet of wire with at least two leads in it, &lt; 1/8&quot; diameter
some electrical tape
some small cable ties
1 generic car lighter adapter with raw leads [$3.50 at Radio $hack]

ok, so i don't have a stereo installed in the dashboard, and the speaker
that's supposed to go under the top center of the dash is not there. this
leaves me with a nice place to snake a small wire through without damaging
the top of the dashboard. I wired the 3' wire to the leads coming off of
the computer cooling fan, and poked it through one of the holes in the
grille for that missing speaker and shaked it to the floor. the fan is held
in place with two cable ties snaked through the screwholes on the fan and a
couple of other spare grille holes.

for now the fan is wired to a 12v lantern battery, because the wiring to my
lighter adapter is not there. so, once i get that in place, i'll hook it up
to the radio shack lighter adapter, probably with a dimmer switch in
between to control the speed of the fan.

this thing blows like a mother! i have a friend who's parents lived in a
small cabin in VT, and they had about 6 of these little fans set up around
the house to move the hot air from the woodstove into other rooms. i figure
if it'll help warm a house, it should work with the bus. i'll report back
once i get to vermont, assuming i don't freeze en route.

happy holidays to all. stay warm!
