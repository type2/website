Subject: Bearing help!?

Volks,

I need a little help getting something straight.  I
measured my crankcase bearing bores and I got 65.76
mm.  The Bentley lists 65.04 as the wear limit.  Does
this mean I need to get a new case?  Is there anything
else I could do, like get the case line bored and a
set of bearings made?  What is the proper way to
handle this?


Thanks,

Ryan
