&gt; Its pretty simple to pull the engine.  The problem you will experience if
&gt; you continue to drive it (and assuming it is the flywheel) is that is will
&gt; wear down the dowel pins holes on the crank.  Then you are in a whole other
&gt; world of pain.  I'd look into soon.

&gt; Is this an urgent situation ( ie can it cause furthure damage)or can it
&gt; go until
&gt; it wears out.
&gt; Ok well I have never pulled the engine out before, but I have read some
&gt; of the
&gt; posts here and I have a friend that has some experience, so I think I
&gt; will have a
&gt; go at it, It makes sense to go with the clutch kit as well having gone
&gt; through the
&gt; hassle of the engine pull.

&gt; &gt; You can diagnose it by the symptoms, which you reported.  You can verify
&gt; &gt; your diagnosis by replacing the throwout bearing and seeing if the noise
&gt; &gt; goes away.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Yes, engine has to come out.  If you are unsure about the condition of
&gt; &gt; your clutch you may want to purchase a clutch kit and replace that while
&gt; &gt; you're in there.  The throwout bearing itself is about $10 and of course a
&gt; &gt; clutch kit is considerably more.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; So the procedure is:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Step 1:  remove engine :-)
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; After that it's easy, just unclip the throwout bearing from the cross
&gt; &gt; shaft and clip the new one in, then reinstall the engine.

&gt; &gt; &gt; thanks for your reply to my problem Sean.
&gt; &gt; &gt; Do you know the procedure or where I can get some info on how to replace
&gt; and
&gt; &gt; &gt; or diagnose that it is the throwout bearing.If it is I assume the engine
&gt; has
&gt; &gt; &gt; to come out.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; help  and advice appreciated.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Sounds like the throwout bearing needs to be replaced.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I have a 73 2 ltre camper ,it started about 3 weeks ago and seems to
&gt; be
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; getting louder as time goes on , also i noticed that the knocking
&gt; sound
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; is now apparent even when the clutch is out.I am wondering if my
&gt; clutch
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; is due for renewal or the flywheel going out , any info on what
&gt; might be
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; causing this sound would be greatly appreciated.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; thnx in advance
