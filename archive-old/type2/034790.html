Hi Jen,
There is a special little tool that you can get for just this purpose! Rocky
Mtn. Motorworks has them for $8.95-$9.50 (depending on the year of your bus)
and Ron at the Bus Depot probably has them for less. The part is called a
rear axle nut removal tool (pretty clever) and the part # for the 46mm nut
is 87496. All you need is this a hammer and a socket wrench to steady it.

Have fun,
Jeff

Subject: Axle Nut


&gt; Hi,
&gt;
&gt; We want to remove and eventually re-torque the rear axle nuts. It's a 46mm
&gt; nut and requires 217 fl lbs according to the manual. We have a 150 ft lb
&gt; torque wrench and we're looking for a cheap torque multiplier to use with
it
&gt; other than the 'torquemeister'? We'd rather not spend $200+ dollars for
that
&gt; with the attachments needed. Can't seem to find any torque multipliers
&gt; around here. Also, we can't seem to find a 46mm socket at any of our local
&gt; stores.
&gt;
&gt; Jen :-)
