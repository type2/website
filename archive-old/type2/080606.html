Subject: Tools - Valve Spring Compressor

Hi.

I saw no responses to the request for a reasonable priced valve spring 
compressor.

here is a link...

http://www.mytoolstore_dot_com/kd/kdengi13.html#3087

But if I ordered my valves via the internet, wouldn't either Bus Depot or 
aircooled_dot_net 'lend' a valve spring compressor??

And on replacing valve guides; there MUST be many opinions in the archives.
