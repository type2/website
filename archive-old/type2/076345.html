Subject: Re: [T2] help!  CV/axle replacement ?'S

You can get the proper tool right off the Mac or Snap On truck, just take
one of the CV cap screws with you (get one out with vise grips, it takes
awhile, but you can do it).  When you get the CORRECT tool, clean out the
cap screw with a small screw driver or scratch awl.  Then use a PLASTIC
hammer to drive the tool into the head, this is very important as these cap
screws will be very tight.

Be sure to use double jack stands on each side under your bus and leave the
wheels on, then start with the inner CV so you can use the wheel and tire to
grab onto while you are applying pressure to the cap screw.

Jack stands are the cheapest insurance you will ever buy, here in town there
have been at least 3 idiots crushed by their own vehicles in the past, one
just down the street, he left a wife and 3 small kids with no life
insurance.  If you don't have any good jack stands, buy them NOW!!!

It takes a bit of time to clean the heads and drive the tool in, but by
doing so, you will not strip any out.  I have done hundreds of CV's and have
maybe stripped a couple of heads when I got in a hurry and didn't clean them
properly.

&gt;&gt; you've gotten lots of metric advice alread
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt;&gt; any tips on getting these things off or the correct sized hexnut
&gt; tool would 
&gt;&gt;&gt; be more than appreciatted.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; I bought some metric hex and the TORX sizes that are actually should
&gt; be on
&gt;&gt; the replacement that will go on my socket set, and I use my breaker
&gt; bar to
&gt;&gt; work em loose
&gt; 
&gt; Woah!  I've never seen a Torx fastener on a VW bus.  The CV bolts are
&gt; either triple-square (usually) or Allen hex.  The triple-square can be
&gt; undone only with a triple-square wrench, commonly available from VW
&gt; suppliers in the form of a 3/8 inch drive socket.
&gt; 
&gt; If the bolts are stubborn, spray your favorite penetrating oil around
&gt; the back of the stub axle flange, on the wheel side of the CV.  This is
&gt; hard to get to, but this is where the threads live.  Spraying the heads
&gt; of the CV bolts won't do much good.
&gt; 
&gt; When you reassemble, put a dab of anti-sieze on the bolts!
