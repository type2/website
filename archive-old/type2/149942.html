Subject: Re: Tranny Questions

I have a 71 bus that needs a tranny.  My question is will a 76 tranny fit,
if
I change the bell housing?  Is that possible?
Does a 76 tranny have different gearing?

I want higher gearing for the highway.  Should I just buy a freeway flyer
tranny?

Richard,

The 76 Tranny will need the bell housing, input shaft, clutch lever assembly
and mounting bracket from your 71. 1st, 2nd and 3rd are similarly geared
like the 71 but are all slightly higher ratio than your 71. 4th is quite a
bit higher geared and will give you a much higher cruising speed.

The downside is the motor will spin at a lower rev at lower speeds (like in
traffic), thus making the cooling fan turn slower as well. If you have a
tired engine, this may result in higher engine temps at lower speeds.

Also be aware that if there are any steep hills where you live, your forward
momentum will be significantly compromised. Especially if you have a single
port 1600 like my 70 DC with a 72 tranny :)

I just did this on my 68 DC project and swapped in a 79 tranny. But I did
mate it with a 1914 EFI motor... So it should be pretty well matched.

Any good VW tranny builder can swap the parts from the two in a about an
hour,
sans rebuilding the 76.

Good luck!
