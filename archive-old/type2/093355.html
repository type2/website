Subject: Need exhaust manifold advice

Please talk to me about diagnosing and fixing an exhaust manifold leak on 
my rebuilt 76 two liter.

I have about 30 miles on the newly overhauled original engine, and today 
one of the cylinders has started blowing fire out around it's exhaust 
manifold pipe, where the pipe enters the head.

The exhaust header from the cylinder on the passenger rear is allowing 
visible flames to come out at the place where the header mates with the 
underside of the head. And it is LOUD.  I tried tightening the two nuts on 
the studs at that cylinder, but it didn't help, and I was afraid to go any 
tighter because I think there is aluminum alloy up in there somewhere.

Do I have to replace that header, or can I take it off and devise/find/buy 
a gasket of some kind that will seal up that space?  The other 3 cylinders 
are tight at the headers, but this one is showing fire when I have the 
bottom plate off and it is just sitting there idling.

Or, is this possibly a problem in the head? Could this be a cracked head? 
I'm hoping that talking this over with the type-2 list will get me moving 
in some reasonable direction toward resolving this problem.

My impression at this point is that I have to take off the header and 
examine both the head and the header pipe, to try to determine why it isn't 
sealing.   Any ideas there? This must have happened to at least a thousand 
other people since the middle 70's.
