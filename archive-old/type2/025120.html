hi

There has been lots of reports recently on the list of 
extended travel in buses and I also am off into europe for 4 
months this summer.   Oh how i appreciate the perks of a job 
in education with wonderful summer holidays :)

the  questions that i would like help on:

What do you all recommend should go into a spares kit for a 
trip like this? I always carry a spare clutch cable, 
accelerator cable, plus spare bulbs (spare bulbs are 
compulsory in many places in Europe), but i guess i need a 
lot more spares for an extended trip.  I am sure you will 
all have lots of experience i could benefit from on this.

Also what tools should i *always* carry with me in the van?

i have my other camping and working equiptment down to a 
bare minimum and so do have some space for spares, tools 
etc.  I always take my laptop and mobile phone (my trips are 
always a mix of business and pleasure) so if i do get into 
problems i know i will be able to ask the list!!
