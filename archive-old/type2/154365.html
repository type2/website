Subject: Re: [T2] vanagon seats in '77 bay

Hi Ryan,

Installing those in a pre-75 bus would require major surgery. The  
bulkhead behind the passenger would have to be cut out and a gusset  
installed, after which the seat bases would need to be welded in.

Are you SURE it's a 71???  Has it got an upright engine and a wrap- 
around front bumper??


Happy Trails,

Greg Potts

&gt; Hey, I've been on the list a few months and am new to air-cooled VW
&gt; but thought I'd chime in. My ' 71 hightop has swivel vanagon seats.
&gt; They work great, slide on tracks fine and its nice to have them
&gt; rear-facing when camping. I didn't install them so I can't vouch for
&gt; how easy it was.
