Subject: RE: [T2] Thinking of XM satellite radio.

&gt; Which is why I have a Rio MP3 unit ready to go into my bus 
&gt; when it gets back from the shop.  No loss of signal.  I've 
&gt; only got two 10GB hard drives in it at present, so I'm 
&gt; limited to 20GB of files, but so far I've been putting all of 
&gt; my CD's content in it.  Very cool.
&gt; 
&gt; You can put almost any audio file in the unit, books, music, 
&gt; etc.. It's exactly the same size as a standard car radio unit,


So you have a Rio Car too!!

I have one with a 40 gig hard drive and don't know how I ever lived
without it. It's an incredible unit, way ahead of its time. I put extra
sleeves in my other cars (an old Mini Cooper, a Fiat 500, and a Fiat
Spider) so I can move the same head unit from car to car.  (If you
haven't already, do the Emplode hack; it adds a lot of very useful
features.)
