Subject: Re: [T2] overfilling your oil???

Christopher- Your p-mail is bouncing tonite.
You must now clean the engine. There may be an accumulation of oil in the
fan housing, and it is coming out with the fan spinning
clockwise, blowing oil into the heat exchanger.
Hose deep into the fan area, then drive home and check again.
If the seal is blown there, you can remove the fan and the fan hub to
replace the small seal. Not a big job. If it is indeed the oil cooler seals,
this requires the fan housing to be removed. If it were a 914, I would say
it is easier to feed in new cooler seals with the fan housing installed.You
have a bus-much easier access to the fan housing and seals. First verify as
best you can.

&gt;
&gt; I should have said that I know I have the correct amount in there now, in
&gt; fact by the time I get off of work I am sure it will be a little low. I'm
&gt; afraid however, that on my last trip and after a very recent oil change
when
&gt; it was almost too clean to tell the level, that I overfilled it thinking I
&gt; lost a lot more than I actually had, and caused some kind of damage as a
&gt; result.
