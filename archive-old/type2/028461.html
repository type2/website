I agree with Andy.


Just put the battery in a plastic box and secure it with a strap. Get
yourself a mechanic's mirror and a 1 qt. squeeze bottle with a 2 ft. length
of fuel hose in the cap for filling.  Piece of cake.  Grease the battery
terminals liberally, use treated felt terminal washers and put opposing
pressure on the cable end as you tighten and you have to remove it once
every 5-7 years.  Sheesh!!

&gt; &gt;For this reason, I'm thinking of moving the battery to underneath the
&gt; &gt;rear bench seat.  I guess the major concern about this is venting.
&gt; &gt;Would this be a major health concern.. it puts off hydrogen when
&gt; &gt;charging, right???

Man
have you ever owned a bug? The battery under the seat is a royal PITA im
much happier with the bus positioning. Not to mention that in a beetle its
a fire hazard. Sit on seat, springs touch batt, horsehair lights up.
