Hello        There  is a vw shop in Durham   next to chapel
hill called Hicks 
VW's . Seems  to know aircooled vw's well.      I'm about  3
hours from 
there, north    Mark Dearing    Salem Import Service  Salem
Va.


Bob Hicks at Hicks VW does know VWs, I'm sure... but he
doesn't like people who work on their own VWs at all. Ask
him a question and he's quite likely to make a crack about
how he gets paid to answer questions like that. Take him a
car you bought from someone else, and he'll give you all
kinds of static about the &quot;shade tree&quot; mechanics who have
worked on it. Mind you, I bought a bug from him and it was a
great car... like I say, he knows his stuff, but he's
abrasive.

HOWEVER, also in Durham is Ron Benson of Quality VW Service.
QUALITY VW SVC
603 ELLIS RD
DURHAM, NC
(919)596-1215

Ron is a splendid human being, who will talk VWs all day,
says he doesn't mind giving free advice because he knows
that the people who ask for it will bring him their business
when they hit the tough stuff. He rebuilt the above bug's
engine, which drove me across country when I moved. Tell Ron
hello from Hall... that I sold the bug and have a bus now!
