Subject: Re: [T2] Bumper Removal on '75 Van



&gt; I'm carrying out some bodywork repair on the rear left corner of my van, but
&gt; I really need to remove the rear bumepr so I can get to the area properly. I
&gt; assume that the bumper is held on by the 4 bolts on the bumper stems. The
&gt; far two nuts (the ones furthest from the rear of the vehicle, on both stems)
&gt; come undone easily, but the near two won't budge an inch. I've been applying
&gt; WD40 on the nuts for the last week to no avail. Any reason why these nuts
&gt; won't come undone? I don't want to force (insert rachet extension pipe here)
&gt; them if there is a reason they don't come undone.

WD 40 sucks as a rust buster......it was designed for water dispersal, not a
penetrent. Get a real penetrent like Liquid Wrench.

Not sure which bolts/nuts you are trying to remove. You should be unbolting it
where the brackets bolt to the frame. Two bolts on each side going up into the
frame.
If I remember right, they are 17mm headed bolts. Yes, they will be tight.
