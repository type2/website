I replaced the right side heater cable in my 1970 Kombi before knowing the
list existed and had no problems feeding the new cable into the metal tube
without the help of a guide string.  I just paid attention to where the
cable had been, and made sure I used the same holes.  Unless Volkswagen
changed the type of guide tube in the later bay window busses, I wouldn't
anticipate a problem.  The key is to pay attention to what you take apart so
you can put it back together.

Subject: Heater Cable Replacement


&gt;Greetings,
&gt;
&gt;I need to replace the heater cables on my '79 Westy.  I have the new cables
(thanks Bus Depot) and have read the article in the Type2_dot_com Library.
Here's the problem, the article suggests tying a strng to the old cable and
pulling it through to the front then use the string to pull the new cable
through to the back.  I had to cut my old cables and have nothing to tie the
string to.  Has anyone ever done this by simply pulling the old cable out
and feeding a new cable in from the front without the aid of the string to
pull it back?
&gt;
&gt;Please reply to the list or to rweisel_at_uswest_dot_net as I'm writing this from
work and will be leaving shortly.  TGIF!!!
&gt;
&gt;Rob Weisel
&gt;'79 Deluxe Westy
