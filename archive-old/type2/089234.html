Subject: Starting Probs

Thanks to those who replied to the following :
I thought this problem might be the tranny ground strap......but it is
&gt; connected
&gt; She will start with a jump start and run good and drive good she will
&gt; even
&gt; start without cables for a minute after i shut her off but iff i try to
&gt; start her three minutes later i get nothing. What is going on with my
&gt; baby????
&gt; Frank

..But the battery is good i already checked it twicw could this be another
problem???
