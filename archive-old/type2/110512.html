Subject: Re: [T2] Carb Cleaner

&gt; Hey there-
&gt;
&gt; I am going to rebuild my carbs on my '73 (34-PICT 3,4) today and have a
&gt; question: The article in the library on this subject mentioned a carb cleaner
&gt; that comes in something like a paint can that you can actually dip parts into.
&gt; Sounds like a great idea, but just got me a blank look at my local FLAPS. My
&gt; question is this: Is there anything special in carb cleaner?

Yes there is.  It's nasty stuff, smells to high heaven, and what do you do
with it when you're done cleaning?  Left on its own, it will eat through
its own can in a few years, contaminating whatever is under it.

After one
experience with dips I went to using the spray carb cleaners.  The spray
cleaners are still nasty, but at least they evaporate!  It is very nice to
be able to direct the cleaner through the passages to make sure thay all
get cleaned.  The &quot;dip&quot; cleaners sometimes don't get into all the
convoluted passages.

With either of these, use gloves and eye protection.  Even with gloves,
remove all rings and watches.  If a little of either cleaner gets under
your ring, it will burn the skin.  Don't ask how I know.
