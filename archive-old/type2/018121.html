Subject: Driving I40 west from Memphis to CA, looking 4 emergency contacts and 
 junkyards :)
Message-ID: &lt;3746D01D.2EBAF620_at_mindspring_dot_com&gt;

HI,
I am moving from Atlanta to Monterey CA on monday.  I will be driving my
'77 westy on route that takes me from Atlanta-&gt;Birmingham-&gt;Memphis then
all the way to Cali on I40.  I am looking to have a list of a few
emergency contacts along the route who may be sources for local VW info
in case of problems.  

Although I have fixed the few known mechanical problems and addressed
anything that was marginal with my bus, something unknown may creep up. 
If you wouldn't mind a phone call from me asking advise on local
mechanics/shops/parts or advise, I would be very grateful if you sent a
number to me via private email.  

As well if you know of any great junkyards that have bus' in them along
that route I am going to try and find a number of parts for myself and
people who have posted needs on the list.

Also if there are any great campgrounds on this route, I would love to
hear about such.  My relo package includes hotels, but I would always
prefer to sleep in the bus in some great natural spot.  Thanks,
Scoob aka Scott
'77 Westy
