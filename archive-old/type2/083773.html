Subject: Re: [T2] vacuum integrity of &quot;biscuits&quot;

Holmes, awesome.


&gt; They should not leak at all. But.... Some dual units have a tiny hole in the
&gt; can on the advance side to bleed off vacuum when the throttle is closed. The
&gt; retard side should not leak.
&gt;
&gt; Look on the arm of each one. You will see a 3 or 4 digit number stamped into
&gt; it. That is the ending numbers of the long Bosch number. It does not translate
&gt; to the short number. For your 71, you should have a 211 905 205Q dist with a
&gt; 07 054 vacuum unit. This would be a vacuum unit with 521 on the arm [1 237 121
&gt; 521].
&gt; It should have an advance range of 2-5 degrees and a retard range of 11-13
&gt; degrees.
&gt; AN is a 72-73 bug manual trans distributor. It has a 07 102 vacuum unit that
&gt; is very close to a bus 521. Vac advance is a little more, 5-8. This is
&gt; providing the arm has 889 on it...
&gt; AJ is a 71 bug manual trans distributor. It has a 07 223 vac unit. I would not
&gt; use this one in a bus. Vac advance is a whopping 9-12 degrees! This is
&gt; providing the arm has 969 or 2969 on it.
&gt; Email me your arm numbers and I can tell what they fit and what the
&gt; advance/retard range is.
