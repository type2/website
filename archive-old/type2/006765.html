I just had the very same sound comming from my bus, I just got done putting on
new cv joints and the sound is gone. When i took off the shaft and joints the
metal was torn up and you could see where the ball bearings were rubbing
against the metal, made indentations, im sure that was making the sound,  Its a
good thing to check it out soon so it doesn't do more damage wich could get
quite expensive.  I just bought a whole new shaft and cv joints already put
together so all i had to do was pull off the old one and put on the new one,
didnt have to worry about packing the joints since everything was done. It was
a pretty easy job. This was my first time doing this  and took about an hour to
do each side.  Hope this helps a little.
