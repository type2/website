three guesses to the oil leak coming down from your filter:

- it is an aftermarket oil filter that burst
- the filter is tight, but the place where it attaches is scored and it is
leaking through there
- OR, the most likely scenario is your oil cooler is leaking where it attaches
to the case, which is really a pain in the *$$ to fix, it involves pulling the
engine
