Subject: Broken engine/replacement

try to find a Mexican new engine.....

Any ideas on where I could do this or is it legal?

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

I bought my new Mexican 1600 from Ronnie in lake
Havasu 
928 680-7664 several years ago and I know several
others on this list who has done the same and as far
as I know all are very happy with the engines. The
quickest and most reliable method you could go. 

Good luck on any which way you choose
