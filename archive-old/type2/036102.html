Subject: Hub Puller Information

Hi,

Someone wrote me and asked me for info the on the five leg puller we bought
and used to remove Jude's rear brake drum...

Our experience buying it from a tool store was an interesting one to say the
least but you folks can get it from OldForge Tools http://www.oldforge_dot_com/.
I did not buy mine from them directly so I can't say whether they are great
or not, but this is where the supplier got the puller he sold to us. We
bought the Univeral Hub Puller. They have a no. 2518 and a 2519... one of
those has 3 legs and one has 4... don't remember which has which and the
catalogue isn't clear on it (poor grammar).  You would want the one that has
four legs and then purchase the fifth leg. The catalogue says &quot;Made of alloy
steel and drop forged, this very tough tool has a center screw 1&quot; - 14 x 9&quot;
with a 1 1/8 hex head...&quot;

We paid a total of about $150 for the tool including buying the extra leg. I
have no idea if we paid too much and I don't really want to know at this
point. We probably did. Seemed extravagant and excessive at the time, but it
made such a difference in getting the rear drum off that it definitely seems
worth it now. This tool will last forever too.

Btw, I have nothing to do with this company at all. Hope this info helps
someone!
