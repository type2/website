Subject: Re: [T2] distributor shaft washer

Hey Guys   First there is probably two of them ,but I have seen  as many as 5 
in a reman vw engine from the factory. They bwill probably end up  around the 
oil strainer . They aren't very stout or very big.  You will  need new ones 
in their place or the dizzy shaft might not  come up to the  dizzy and without 
them you could cause premuture wearing of the case where the  shaft rides. I 
would drain the oil and remove the screen and fish around with a  stick magnet. 
I don't think you will find them thur the dizzy hole.  Later  Mark Dearing
