Subject: FW: Tires and rims (Bay / Vanagon)

&gt; &gt; I already bought 1 Conti Contact (CS21?) in a 205/65/15 and
&gt; &gt; mounted it on
&gt; &gt; the 6x15 Fuchs. It looks great and fits (*barely* in the back
&gt; &gt; with the 1&quot; adapters)...
&gt; 
&gt;  Can you let me know the Load Index for these?

Sorry, it's not &quot;CS21&quot;, but Continental Contact *CT22* Reinforced *CT22*,
which has a 99T load index (1709lbs_at_118mph). This is the Eurovan tire and
costs $58 at the tire rack (plus shipping plus mounting).
