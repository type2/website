Subject: broken cam? wtb engine


&gt; I have been lurking for a few weeks since the Buses and Punkin Chunkin
&gt; in the first state. Let me fill everyone in on my last two weeks. On my
way
&gt; to Punkin Chunkin
&gt; My pressure plate gave out. I drove it like that for a week. I finally
pull
&gt; the engine and install a pressure
&gt; plate that I had pulled from a bus about 6 months earlier. Upon
reinstalling
&gt; the engine. I fired it up and
&gt; thought that the engine sounded different.(kinda too valvey)Is that a
word?
&gt; On my way to work yesterday my
&gt; bus just stopped. I had put a new fuel pump on two days before and thought
&gt; that it must be bad. It`s 2:00 am and
&gt; I didn`t feel like messing with it so I flagged a coworker down and he
gave
&gt; me a lift. I checked it out when
&gt; I got off and had fuel and fire but no start. I thought wow the motor is
&gt; sure turning over fast. So I check and no valve are moving when I crank
it.
&gt; I towed home and pulled it out. I haven`t torn it apart yet. I did drain
the
&gt; oil and it looks like there is some silver in it. I guess that was the
noise
&gt; I was hearing. Anybody ever break a cam? Anybody have a motor for sale?
&gt; I am located in Delaware.
&gt; Thanks,
