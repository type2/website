Subject: Re: bellhousing needed

I ran into fasterlaster on the type2 irc channel
(plug -- irc.type2_dot_com, channel #buslist)
and he pointed me to aircooled_dot_net for the
resin starter mount. It mounts directly to the
engine case, and is just big enough to hold a starter
in place. This will work perfectly for me,
since I already have an engine stand.

They sell them for $55 for just the mount, and $70 
for a kit that also contains a remote starter switch.

Thanks to all for your replies.
