Subject: gas tank/pump

Well the Vanagon broke down the other night, in the rain.  After frantically
trying to figger out what was going on I deduced that the fuel pump was bad.
I have one of those electricamal pumps for use with carbs.  Anyway, while I
had all the hoses off (from the gas tank to where the rubber hose from the
pump connnects to hard plastic hose to engine compartment) and was trying to
do some figgerin' I realized &quot;hey, shouldn't there be gas pouring out of the
tank?&quot;  I knew I had gas in there becuase I had just filled it up (ok there
was 1/4 of a tank of gas in there... .that's a fill up to me at $1.55/gal
for 87).  But there was nothing coming out of the tank.  A quick thought
went through my head that went something like &quot;I KNOW I just put gas in
there.... right? Did I miss the filler tube??? No, ok I'm not going crazy&quot;
So in a moment of stupidity I decided I was going to suck on the hose going
to the tank to make sure there was gas in there.  Gas is yucky and it burns
your eyes.  That's the lesson for the day.  So now for the big question....
Why didn't gas pour out when the hoses were disconnected??? There wasn't
anything blocking the outlet or I would have eaten it.  Is there some sort
of filter in the tank that could get gunked up or some sort of check valve??
The tank is vented (ok not properly but it is vented).  I don't want to burn
up this fuel pump by making it suck gas through 2 inches of muck.  Thanks
list.
