Subject: Re: [T2] The Great Flood

Also, if you run it 'till the oil gets nice and hot, it'll evaporate the
water out of the system.  You'd probably also want to change the oil
filter if water's been pumped through the system.

What I'm wondering is how water would have gotten in the case.  Are you
sure that stuff wasn't there before?  I have seen some weird creamly
looking stuff which someone mentioned before on the list.  I believe
they said it had to do with water vapors being evaporated from the case...
