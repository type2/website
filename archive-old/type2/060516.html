 [[[ Background ]]]

I'm getting the final parts together for my new Mexican 1600DP engine.
Plans are to feed the block with my Gene Berg dual Kadrons and put this
engine into my 1963 Crew Cab.  The Crew has a new transaxle going in Sunday
(Todd Hill and Clara Williams in Olympia for providing tranny and assisting
with install!)

Anyway -- as you may know, I purchased a rebuilt Bosch 38 AMP Generator to
replace a failed one on my old engine.  I had to get the gen working,
running around with a spare battery and switching with one on charge was
getting old, real quick :)

Anyway -- I knew nothing of the woodruff key and posted for help on
installing the pulley and fan on the gen.  I got some help from the list and
figured that out.  Ben running fine with my new Generator on my '63 Crew
Cab.

  [[[ New information ]]]

On to prep for new Mexican longblock (Beetlemex $980 - ordered with solid
lifters).  My old engine is 1500SP, and is good enough, but not good enough
for the Todd Hill special freeway flyer.  However, I'm not scrapping it -- I
will be painting the tin / replacing muffler / cleaning it -- will most
likely be a spare engine or go into a bug I am going to sell.  But, as you
might have figured -- this means I'm not stealing parts from it for my new
Mexican longblock.

So, I'm big on mail order, I used to run a computer business and you have to
depend on UPS or die from depreciation of your inventory.  So I'm well
accustomed to dealing with mail order houses.  Tips:  order via e-mail or
fax, written information, is best.  I don't always follow this rule,
especially when doing a first or second purchase and want to be familiar
with the company.  Results:  VW mail order houses, the 5 or 6 I have ordered
from, are all extremely informal on order taking and very lax.  &quot;Custom 1
warehouse&quot; is the worst of the lot, but they have shipped what I asked for
each of the two times I ordered.  These places are also slow.  The best
price / service combo for &quot;general parts&quot; has come from Southern California
Imports.  I'm not saying other's have had bad experience, but I've ordered 3
times from them -- each order about $300 and consisting of 8 to 12 parts.
All arrived as expected, no price surprise, no mix up.  I do attribute this
to my experience ordering via mail order, as I have my order written out
before I telephone and I also triple check things like address, especially
whey they seem to too quickly say &quot;got it&quot;.

  [[ The Bosch Stuff ]]

The Type2 list has said a lot over the last 2 years about the decline of
quality of Bosch generators.  Type 1 powered Type 2's never came with an
Alternator (did they?), as the Type IV engine was introduced before the
switch.  So, I suspect that there isn't a lot of Alternator discussion.
However, there is a lot on the Bug list (VINTAGVW) and others...

So Southern California Imports sells a complete &quot;Alternator Conversion Kit&quot;
for $120 ($10 of which is core fee, why bother?).  This includes the stand /
alternator / strap / pulley / tin.  Given that I paid almost that much for a
38AMP Generator at a local VW FLAPS, and that didn't even include the
expensive 38AMP voltage regulator -- I contemplated the often repeated
advice on the VINTAGVW list -- go Alternator!

This engine isn't stock for my '63 crew by any means.  A 1600DP with Dual
40mm Kadrons... which means I am using an electric fuel pump too.  Not much
reason to think about &quot;stock appearance&quot; here.  $120 also gets me a Gen/Alt
stand, which I didn't have...

Arrived as expected, actually very quickly (4 business days).  All was
there.  The Alternator is marked on the body by Bosch as NEW and the box
says NEW.  However, the metal case has a few smudges / dings that make it
look rebuilt -- but everything else on it looks pristine and untouched.
I'll just chalk that up as the Bosch factory not treating the case as
anything special and let it get a bit dinged before assembly.

This is the AL82N -- which has an internal regulator.  ((You may have
noticed that the &quot;conversion kit&quot; parts didn't include a regulator, and I
noticed that it didn't list one either --- but I had a hunch this would work
out.  And it did.))  Wow, $120 for both the Alternator and the Regulator is
sounding like an even better deal.  Plus, less wires -- liking this!

 [[ The unexpected items ]]

I haven't installed this yet, just going over it to make sure this is what I
want.  Given my Generator install and learnin' about woodruff keys .. I was
shocked to see the following written in the install page:

   &quot;NOTE:  Replacement unit may not be supplied with rotor shaft key way --
KEY WAYS ARE NOT CRITICAL.  For proper pulley and fan performance, PROPER
TORQUE ON PULLEY NUT IS CRITICAL.&quot;

Never heard anyone say this!  That the Bosch says the woodruff key is
optional. New info to me.  I'm using one anyway (and the AL82N does have key
ways on the shaft).  I just thought that this bit of info might be of
interest to the list.

Next, this Alternator came with a registration card!  And this card outlines
the ___ Bosch Ultimate Protection Plan! ___ -- which boils down to a &quot;24
hours a day, 365 days a year, anywhere in U.S. or Canada&quot; -- &quot;Should your
Starter or Alternator fail during the next two years, you are eligible for a
free jump start , or tow if necessary, from a qualified Road Service
Provider&quot;

My questions to the list:  My generator sure as heck didn't come with this
card.  Nor have the two starters I recently purchased (which were Bosch
parts rebuilt by Exide, so I understand that one).  As it clearly says
&quot;Alternator&quot; and no reference to &quot;Generator&quot; -- one more reason to say good
deal.  Obvious which Bosch has more confidence in.

BTW:  The Alternator is a lot lighter and simpler.  The regulator / AC to DC
converter is inside the unit and can be seen.  In general, it is very
apparent how the technology of Alternator is much more efficient.  The 52
AMPS generated from a much smaller and lighter device (also half empty on
the inside, real clean and simple).
