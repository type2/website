Subject: Bus man is also a Bee Man!

On our local news last night (I watch the 10:00 news on ole right wing
fox)(11:00 is too late) your favourite bus mechanic and mine was on the
news, who? Mark Dearing of Salem Import Auto in Salem, VA.

It seems he is the man that goes out an captures bees that find themselves
in unwelcome places like rotting trees and eaves of houses.  When I was at
his shop two weeks ago he showed me a water tank that he rescued from a
salvage lot that was slam full of bees, probably 10k of them!

Are you bringing honey to High Country this year, Mark?

I wish I recorded the story about him, but maybe some else has it.

Regards,

Mark
