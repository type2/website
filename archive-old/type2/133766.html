Subject: Re: [T2] Distributor drive gear backwards...NOW WHAT??

&gt;From: scott lyons
&gt;there is only one washer underneath the type IV distributor drive gear.


Touche! That I was not aware of I have not had to pull one out of a Type IV 
yet. Many times on a Type I, though and there are two there.

Thanks Scott,

Michael Knight
