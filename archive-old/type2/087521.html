&gt;    Hey Friends,   Sad news came to town yesterday.  Tues  evening Glen,
&gt;the brewmaster at the wild duck was killed in a tragic  accident.  The man
&gt;who brought you Spankdog, Sasquatch, Glen's Special  Bitter that fabulous
&gt;Russian Imperial Stout and many other fine brews is no  longer with us. 
&gt;There was a shrine set up and bitter flowing yesterday at  the WD. 
&gt;Thought you might want to stop by the Duck and have a beer for  Glen.  
&gt;For those Volkswagen owners among  us.....please, please be careful
&gt;climbing under your bus with a screwdriver  heading for the starter.  
&gt;It's a great day to be alive!   Rex  
&gt;
