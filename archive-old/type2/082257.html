&lt;&lt;  if I reach down
&gt; in between the front seats, I can feel a cool breeze coming from the back

that seems possible. I experience the same thing as well w/ a cold
breeze (very slight) moving btwn the seats fwd. I work w/ a bunch or
Mech. engineers I'll have to ask one to elaborate on this. &gt;&gt;

Check the openings in the floor - clutch, brake, gas, brake fluid res. -
to see if cold air is being blown up from under the bus...
