Subject: Spring plates adjusted--I'm not insane!

I was having one heckuva time adjusting my sping plates on my '71 Westy.
 Specifically, I couldn't get the spring plate to stay back on the lower stop
after I adjusted the spring plate on the torsion bar.

That all changed after I met a wise man in the junk yard this morining.  Mr.
Billy Manley, VW expert of 25 years, revealed to me an ancient Chinese
secret.  It's called once you jack the spring plate up and bang the top of
the plate onto the torsion bar spline, you jam a phillips head screwdriver
into one of the cover plate holes and push the cover down until you can start
one of your four screws.  After that the rest of the screws are easier to
start.  This piece of ancient wisdom worked like a charm and possibly saved
my sanity.

Thank you Billy Manley whereever you are.  Actually, he's in Redlands and
does VW work on the side (909) 799-3972.  Check him out of you're in the
Inland Empire area.  Seems like a decent guy.

All is well again.
