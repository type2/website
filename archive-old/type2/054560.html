Hey Mike,

I finally named my bus.  It is a 71 westy.  She is now called &quot;Dizzy&quot;.  That
is pretty much how I have felt when I have: repainted the motor tin in my
closed garage, adjusted the idle, ran the heater with an exhaust leak and
when the motor hatch fell on my head and knocked me out cold (true story).
Can you please add her to your list of names?  I will give you a link to her
as soon as I finish the web page.  Thanks!

Justin

Greetings all -

We're going to the Los Angeles County Raceway (in Palmdale) tomorrow to go
watch our first &quot;VW only&quot; drag race.

We'll get pit parking, so if you see Itch (white 69 Westy) or me riding my
black Viza gas scooter, stop by and say hi.

I was going to take Itch down the track, but they want $50 to enter - I
could do a full tune-up and In-n-Out burgers for that money, so I'll just
cruz and watch the cars go by.

Have a great W/E.
