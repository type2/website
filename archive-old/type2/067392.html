Subject: Re: BUS CARPETS

&gt;This weekend, I plan, I my grand scheme for putting my bus back
&gt;together, to MAKE MY OWN CARPETS....?

I did this with my bus, but you're ahead of me with the rubber paint and
the underlay and everything.  I just bought some indoor/outdoor carpet and
cut it out exactly like the old orange carpet and slapped it in there.  On
top of the particle board stuff that was already there, of course.

&gt;bound at the edges or not....I figure they shouldn't fray given that
&gt;they have rubber backs.

Mine has frayed, but it doesn't have a rubber back so I guess we'll just
have to wait and see on that.

&gt;glue on using....what?  I guess some sort of carpet glue, if such a
&gt;thing exists...?

Couldn't find anything to make it stick there, so I just got that painted.
It's pretty gross, what with all the old glue fromt eh rubber stuff still
there.  Good luck.

&gt;How easy were they to cut out...any tips for doing so?

Easy.  Just used an exacto knife in the parking lot of a grocery store (for
good light, this was when I was nocturnal).  Use the old stuff, though.
Especially for the front sections around the seats and pedals and
everything.  Its very useful up there.
