&gt; 1.  The dimensions of the old floor were 52 inches long by 60 inches
&gt; wide, just a little bigger than you can get from one sheet of plywood.  I
&gt; was thinking of using 2 pieces each 52 x 30 inches, but don't know of a good
&gt; way to hold the pieces securly together, edge to edge.  Do you?

Let's say you're planning to put in a 3/4&quot; thick plywood floor. To get a
single sheet of plywood is pretty easy, but you need to piece it together.
You'll need three sheets of 3/8&quot; exterior plywood. Really. You also need
some glue--Titebond II is my pick, it's weatherproof. Also get four 2x4s, a
roll of duct tape and some sheet metal screws. All this will make sense in a
minute. Tools? A circular saw and a drill with a bit that will turn sheet
metal screws, and a cheap paintbrush.

Start by crosscutting all three sheets to 52 inches long. This will give you
three usable 44-inch scraps.

Take two sheets and rip a 30&quot; piece out of each and a 12&quot; piece out of one.
Leave the other one alone.

Put duct tape along one 4-inch side of each 2x4.

Lay the four 2x4s out on your floor, two of them about four feet apart and
the other two spaced between them. Duct tape up. Put the two 30-inch-wide
plywood pieces over the 2x4s, butted together and even at the ends. Spread
glue generously yet quickly on the 30-inch-wide plywoods; if you have
children have all of them help. When you have glue all over everything, lay
the 48-inch and 12-inch plywood pieces on top of the 30-inch pieces, and
screw the plywood to the 2x4s. (The screws are your clamps.) When you've
screwed it down well, go away for a day or two--no less than 24 hours.

When you come back, remove all the screws, put on a coat of good exterior
paint to prevent moisture from eating the wood, and put the plywood in your
Bus. Add linoleum or carpet as desired.
