&gt;Assuming the torque specs were developed with the same fasteners you are
&gt;retightening I should think all torques are accounted for.

Unless noted otherwise in Bentley, the spec is clean and dry and, yes, in
this case all torques are accounted for in the spec. This assumes they can
be turned down with fingers. If you got rust pits and crud creating run in
torque, your not spec. Anti seize in this situation is a panacea. Replace
all hardware if condition of the threads is poor, or at the very least
chase the treads with a tap/die to clean them up and get all that pasty
hardening antiseize out of there.

Guess what happens if you got 15 lbs run in torque and 18 lbs spec and try
to put 30 lbs on that spark plug??? You have fouled, weakened threads that
will pull out if not this time, then the next. 

For exhaust fasteners I like to retorque them when hot. Back them off 1/8th
turn then turn back down to spec. Just run the motor for 2 or three minutes
without the final tin in place.

I got a very nice Mercedes SL in the shop right now for a squeeky
serpentine belt replacement. Tensioner adjuster was frozen. Adjuster
threads were fouled with hardened anti seize. Turkey reefed on the adjuster
screw and ruined the bracket it bears against. Instead of a $75 bill, this
one will run over $600. This on a 10 year old, 55,000 mile car. Sure would
have been nice to have that money available for a standard major
maintenance inspection as opposed to unnecessary repairs.
