&gt;  &gt; Here is my question:  in Australia we will find it hard or very expensive
&gt;  &gt; to use unleaded fuel after the year 2000.  The mechanic I use here tells 
&gt; me
&gt;  &gt; the engine is not really designed for unleaded, although he could import
&gt;  &gt; different valves, an upper cylinder lubricant injector and a catalytic
&gt;  &gt; convertor...  Heck! ...
&gt;  
&gt;     This is an '82? It sure should be designed for unleaded -- I think you
&gt;  need to get another mechanic, sounds like he's just trying to sell you a
&gt;  load. Everyone here burns unleaded -- in fact I think it's rather
&gt;  difficult to get leaded fuel anymore.

Hi all,

I didn't realy want to get involved with this, but the above is not quite
correct.

The fact is that VW used different engines in the USA/Canada market from the
rest of the world. for example in '79 loafs...

CJ engine 2000cc, Twin Carb 91 RON LEADED, ignition 7.5 BTDC 70BHP_at_ 4200rpm.
OR
GD engine 2000cc, Fuel injection 91 RON UNLEADED, ignition 5 ATDC
70BHP_at_4200rpm

These were esentialy the same engine but the use of leaded or unleaded fuel is
built into the design of the fuel delivery system and the setting of the
ignition timing..

&gt;From 1980 (T3/wedge/vanagon) on there were 1600 (didn't have that in USA did
you!) and 2000 air-cooled engines - for the 2000cc models. Fuel injection with
contact breakers was used in USA models and engines would run on unleaded
ONLY.
But twin carbs with electronic ignition was used in European spec Vans - these
could use leaded or unleaded BUT THE IGNITION WAS RETARDED 5 DEGREES IF
UNLEADED FUEL WAS TO BE USED.

So you can see the situation is far more complex than just chucking unleaded
in instead of leaded.

The 1600 was NOT designed to run on unleaded petrol and to do so, even with
retarded ignition, you stand a chance of exceeding the max cylinder head temp.

Salvation however is at hand as VW do Brazil produce 1600 heads with SINTERED
metal valve seats and special composition valves to resist higher temps -
retailing in UK for 100 pound per side..

The above facts taken from an article in &quot;Transporter Talk&quot; the Magazine of
the VW Type 2 Owners Club (http://members.aol_dot_com/vwt2oc) writen by Robin
Taylor, a former Beoing Flight Engineer.

I know lots of folk in the USA/Canada, as they have no choice, use unleaded in
thier 1600s but they do run a risk especialy if the ignition is not retarded
[maybe thats why we hear of so meny rebuilds on the list:-)]

So for our friend in OZ by all means get a second opinion but also take a look
at a European handbook (eg Haynes) rather than Bently or Muir where the
settings for leaded / unleaded fuel should be layed out.

And for our friends in the USA please, please please remember that not all the
world is the same as the USA and that your Bently and Muir manuals DO NOT
cover non North American spec VWs

Good luck
Bob
