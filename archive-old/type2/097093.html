Subject: Free Bus Comes Home!

Had my &quot;free&quot; bus towed to my house today, and started to tear into it
immediately. My wife and daughter even helped out, extremely rare for them
when it comes to one of my car projects, although they are the ones who pushed
me to get this bus. The first thing was a much needed bath, and it will get
another one tomorrow. We then started bagging up the leaves (it was sitting
for ? years with the sliding door open) and other trash from the interior. I
still believe it to be an early '68. If you have the latest edition of VW
Trends, the interior is exactly like the '67 Westy featured.Most of the
camping stuff, sink/icebox cabinet, closet, and the seat/storage bin behind
the drivers seat are removable. There is no canvas under the pop top, and the
torture cot is in shreds. It has rust in the usual places, but I find it
amazing there is no rust around the windshield, and the battery tray is
intact. The rockers are in poor condition, as is the dogleg on the passenger
side, drivers side is OK. The plywood floor under the vinyl floor was so wet
and rotted that I was able to pull it up with my bare hands. The front seats
are in good shape, as is the yellow vinyl on the rear seats/bed. I am leaning
towards restoring this Westy rather than my first thought to part it out,
although it is going to take me a LONG time to do this one. My daughter asked
me this afternoon if I could have it ready for Everybus- I said &quot;Yes, Everybus
2007&quot;.  I have some new pictures posted of today's clean up, click on the link
below to check it out.      Jeff
