I read the Kettering link and ah ha- knew it- the coil is a transformer
that must deal with direct current and can only produce the 15k volts in
the secondary curcuit when the current is switched off by the points and
the magnetic field collapses.  What I found most interesting is that
they say a coil can be destroyed when it has an open secondary curcuit,
such as pull off a spark plug wire.....and how many of us have been told
to yank the center wire off the distributor or coil to prevent a spark
when doing a compression test?  Obviously what I do by common sense is
correct- yank the + wire off the coil so no primare curcuit ever starts.
