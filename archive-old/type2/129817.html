Not VW from Brazil?

&gt;and the second is klokkerholm which i figure is in germany. Does anybody know anthing about theses comapnies is one better than the other metal wise.

Other other is Danish I believe. The metal used to come from Veng which was absorbed into Klokkerholm. Ron Salmon would know the whole story.

OEVeedub says, &quot;Customers often call asking the thickness of our Danish-made sheet metal -- we're happy to report our panels are 1/3 thicker than the Brazilian&quot;.
