Subject: '82 diesel--bad idea?

I came across a '82 diesel westy 4 sale.

Good body--some scrapes but no rust. The engine is
supposed to &quot;run good.&quot; Owner encouraged me to make an
offer.

I have esteem and patience for diesels through my old
Benz, and I'm aware the  diesel in the Bus is
underpowered--even by baywindow standards.

But, I'm sorely tempted. Does the bus diesel avoid the
pitfalls --leaking and loose heads problems-- of the
wasser boxes?

Any guestimates on what its worth--if the engine
checks out?

tnx.
