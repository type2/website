&gt; Geez, I thought *my* FLAPS sucked! Yer bein' had!
&gt; 
&gt; Bus Depot sells German for $39.95, Brazillian for
&gt; $11.95 (these are for the front...rear are cheaper, I
&gt; think). My local FLAPS is about $6.00 higher on both,
&gt; as are other places I've checked.
hi Jaime,

Not neccecarily.  Bus-Depots OR brand has _traditionally_ been brazillian
BUT: I called busdepot to check on availability of brazilian... I asked
specifically if their OR part was brazillian or taiwaneese.  They said
they would have to call their supplier to find out for sure as they dont
keep them on the shelf.  I have yet to call back and find out what the
answer is... (ron?? you always seem to know the scoop on this stuff...)

According to my friend this dry-up in supply is in the past few weeks.
The owner of this local store is trying to make a buck sure, but he is the
only pace to get good vw machine work in town and often his prices are the
same as or cheaper than busdepot, other times they are way out of line.  I
get the impression most stuff vendors tend to source from teh same places,
with notable exceptions (ron taking trips to europe to scoure NOS
stashes, Ronnie working on the english sheetmetal connection etc.)

I tend to shop around and buy a bit here and some there... probably ends
up costing me more what with shipping and gas money, but at least im
having fun :)

take care,

Steve

p.s. to my untrained eye the taiwan part looks good, just fishing for
someone with a testimonial/warning i guess.
