Subject: [T2] 1974 van dies when warm

I had the same problem with exactly the same van. I solved the 
problem by replacing the fuel pump push rod, I think. A few days 
later I had a problem and went back into the fuel pump and found one 
of the valves in the pump was loose. Seems they crimp a plate to hold 
a spring. The crimp has worked loose and the valve was doing very 
little. Check the entire pump, not just the push rod.

Being cheap, I welded a bit of drill rod in the middle of the rod and 
ground the length just a bit too long. Ouch! Broke out the fuel pump 
housing. Not to worry, JB Weld and it has been running well since.

I recall the length of the push rod should be 210mm but you should 
check with others to be sure my memory is not faulty.
