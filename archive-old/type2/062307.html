Got the flier from VW Canvas today. Here are the basics; if you want
details, please write
them directly.
These are all for popups, etc.
67 and earlier -- Deluxe  $179
68-73   -- Deluxe $$249   economy  $219
74-79  -- Deluxe  $269  economy  $229
80 +  --- Deluxe  $359  economy  $329

VW Canvas    104 Hillcrest    La Vernia, TX  78121   210-779-2136

He also makes awnings, curtains, door screens, carries seals, cots, custom
colors...
I received nothing but good mail about his work.
No pickup stuff. Nerts.
What I'm going to  do is contact a maker of the hoops I've been told about,
as well
as a few other parts sources; then maybe a bunch of listers could drop VWC
a postcard and
bombard him with requests to make *just* the canvas again... maybe even a
few solid orders
from those ready for a top NOW. Perhaps if he sees a reliable parts source
and a solid customer
base developing, he'll reconsider.
  I've also checked RMMW, as per lister suggestion; my catalogue makes no
mention of canvas
anything. Maybe just too old?
