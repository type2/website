or you could convert to the earlier exhaust system as used on the 72-74 it

I did it on my 78 and it has been far better than that old system, however
I didn't notice any power increase, SOP system (Seat of pants)

&gt; I am looking to put a larger than stock exhaust system on my 77 westy. my 
&gt; discovery at the local vw import store yesterday was that the Dual Quiet 
&gt; Pack system is unavailable for busses from 75-79. So, i could have a single 
&gt; QP, which feels like less than maximum airflow. So, does anyone have a 
&gt; source for a fatboy or other large exhaust for the late 70's busses. i am 
&gt; considering the ceramic sinlge QP bupack system, any thoughts on all this 
&gt; rambling?
&gt; Thanks,
&gt; -jeremy
