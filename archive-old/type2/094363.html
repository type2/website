Subject: Re: [T2] Converting Engine to Run on Propane (LPG) 

I plan this as well.  Nothing immediate for me.  Several people have done
this with a/c.  I found info here:

www.impco.ws

There is a company in England that imports the Mexican beetle and Brazilian
bus and offers it converted to LPG.  Many folks in Europe do this because
LPG is about 1/3 the cost of gasoline.

&gt; I'm looking for information about converting an air-cooled VW bus to run on
&gt; Propane (LPG) or Compressed Natural Gas (CNG). If not air-cooled then I'll
&gt; have to buy a water-cooled Vanagon for this project.
&gt; 
&gt; Anyone know someone who actually has a propane- or natural gas-powered VW bus
&gt; or Beetle?
