Subject: Re: [T2] Air injection Pump

Chris:
I believe all 73 and 74 1700 and 1800 type 2's had AIR pumps.
Taking them off seems to be a good idea, but only if you don't need their
presence to pass a smog test.
You'll need to plug the holes that go to the exhaust ports, either by
pinching off the tubes or removing the tubes and putting 10 mm threaded
plugs in the holes in the heads. I've used valve lash adjusting screws
from a later type 4 engine. (somewhere they changed from 8mm to 10mm,
about 74 or 75?)
Also, the air pump MAY have a connection with the idle air intake system-
I know I have one with a pinched off tube- I think that is what it was
from.
I'm a little fuzzy on this as it all happened about 20 years ago, and I
can barely remember what I did yesterday!

&gt; Hey gang,
&gt;
&gt;       Does anybody know if a '73 1700cc dual carb bus
&gt; should have an air injection pump. The person who had
&gt; my bus before did some pretty sketchy work on it and
&gt; there wasn't one on there when he gave it to me. Could
&gt; this be real bad?
