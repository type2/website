Subject: '81 Junk Westy FREE
Mime-Version: 1.0

I'm trying this one more time afore it goes to a yard.  '81 full
westy FREE if you take it away from Clarksburg WV.  I will NOT take
any damn thing off of it, if you come to it and don't take anything
that stops it rolling you can have anything you want for $1 for any
item smaller than a loaf of bread, $5 any item larger, per item, I
reserve right to make some valuable small items $5 and give away
stuff free if I like you.

the good (not much):
full interior mostly there
poptop canvas fair with pinholes and water stains but no rips
all front suspension bushings on the A-arms less than 15k miles
maybe new ball joints as well, I don't recall
front rotors were new as well but 3 years of sitting rust
most of the lenses etc still there.
one new steel brake line 8-) ( the one over the tranny)
I THINK the gas tank is there and is one I dropped and
painted but I don't recall at this point.

the bad:
the interior (paradoxical that)
the entire body (well maybe drivers door OK)
no engine, no tranny, no 1/2 shafts
fridge is NOT included (sorry) nor the propane tank
the entire body
no FI stuff


why anyone would want this (I don't really know) well the front end
stuff was to the tune of $400 the kid I bought it from spent, I bought
this with blown engine for $500 4+ years ago.  All the camper stuff
did work but like I said I'm keeping the fridge.  The interior is pretty
ratty and cut for about 1000 speaker holes though, and I'm not
garanteeing what is and isn't there anymore.

The top would make an OK top for a conversion though, its ugly but
intact, and the canvas has a couple years left on it.  The seal is gone
to my '82.  The top bunk cushions were great but unfortunately a
mouse decided to eat a hole in the rear one, could be repaired
easily with fabric off the bottom, shame they were mint.

If you are really interested and near me with a plan I could be
inclined to take a few digital pictures, but it is an effort to get down
to do so.

It will roll away well enough.
