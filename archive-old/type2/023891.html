Hi Kurt,

No doubt you'll get a heap of answers to this one but it's most likely a hot
start problem, although in my Bus it didn't have to be hot to get it.  What
happens, and feel free to correct me anyone if I get this all wrong, is the
power from the battery has to go all the way from the battery through the
ignition switch and then back to the starter..  With old wiring and a long
wire run you get voltage drop.  The amount of voltage you get at the starter
is then not enough to properly switch the solenoid and let the starter kick.

What you do is eithier crawl underneath and hit the solenoid with a BGF once
or twice and it'll unjam and the Bus will start...this is what I did all
Summer but when I finally had to do it in the pouring rain I went for
methoid two which is install a relay so thet the starting button/switch just
turns on the relay and the relay connects the Solenoid straight up to the
battery eleminating the long wire run.  I'm sure this is all through the
archives as well.

Anyway, hope this helps
Steve

This weekend I took my 72 campmobile on a medium length trip.  At our first 
stop about 50 miles along, the motor would not turn over when I went to
start 
it.  It was like the ground cable from the battery was bad(I just replaced
it 
about a month ago)..... &lt;snip&gt;
