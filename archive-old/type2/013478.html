Brian:

There's a VW parts guy in SoCal called Bernie Bergmann that pushes this Porsche 356 in a type-1 engine idea.  I just bought one from him, and haven't installed it yet, but from your experience, it sounds like it works the way Bergmann says it should.  He claims his pulley is heavier and works better than a Porsche pulley, but I can't vouch for that.
