Subject: Re: [T2] AFM interchangability (standard vs. CA)?

Thank you everybody for your input on this matter. I am going to try what
Tim suggested and if I dont have any luck, I will be contacting those of you
that have the part for sale.
Thanks again!

&gt; Dylan:

&gt; I think the best procedure is to actually remove the board that holds the
&gt; contact strip from the AFM (it involves the removal of about 6-8 screws,
if
&gt; memory serves) and then take a small file and &quot;elongate&quot; the holes in the
&gt; board through which the screws go.  The idea is that you can then put the
&gt; board back in the AFM but slightly displaced from where it was such that
the
&gt; contact arm has a fresh area of the resistance strip on which to ride.
