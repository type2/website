Dear friends, This is a big THANKS for being out there. I'm getting down to
the nitty gritty with my new 77 Westy Camper deluxe. I have it up on blocks
with the wheels off. The right side front and rear wheel roter and drum are
shot (price you pay for not changing brakes on time - The previous owner
obviously neglcted the obvious). Regardless, I'm excited about the
restoration. Its that Zen thing I guess VW owners share. Well, I'm looking
forward to interactions with yall (I'm from Louisiana). Hopefully soon I
will be on the road and our paths will cross. These bus
conventions/gatherings sound super...
Davooo
Hey, how do I get a fellow Bus owner on this digest?
