Just had to share this tip.  I was trying really hard to get the
adjusting star out of its hole on the backing plate.... didn't want to
come out with WD40, heat, hammering, etc.  Then, a stroke of brilliance
(or a dimly remembered tip from the past?).  I picked up a bolt, same
size and thread as the adjusting screw, twice as long, and just cranked
it into the adjusting star-- the screw had come out OK, but the
adjusting star was frozen.  The bolt bottomed out in the hole, pushed
the star right out so I could remove the rust with sandpaper, etc, and
grease it up for reinsertion!  Just like a little machinist's jack!

Don't know that I ever saw this one anywhere, thought I'd put it out
there (at least for the archives).

HTH someone, sometime, :&lt;)
