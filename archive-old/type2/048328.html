List:
Sorry about the last post not making sense. I wrote 6-wire and 7- wire
(AFM's), and the spell checker took out both the hyphen and the numeral.
So, than would be:
This sounds like possibly like the 6-wire and 7-wire AFM difference
between 76 and 77.
The solution here is to get the ECU, harness, and AFM all of the same
year, or in the right range anyway.
Look in the archives for posts by Karl.
