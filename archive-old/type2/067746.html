&gt;probably one of the worst vw parts places to deal with as far as customer
&gt;service and accuracy in filling orders.
  
        I've ordered from them with no significant screwups.  (they once
forgot the tensioner pulley for a diesel timing belt)

&gt;guess what? i bounced my first check that week.

        That can be a real pisser, particullary when you have a good reason
to feel that it was someone elses fault.  A suggestion, talk to your bank
about setting the account so that if a check is overdrawn it automaticly
gets taken out of a saving account. (then if that fails they claim that they
will tack it on any existing loan, I'll bet that they pick the one with the
highest intrest!)

&gt;i was polite during my many calls to parts place. but they didn't seem to care
&gt;about my buisiness there and customer service actually was rude a couple of
&gt;times. i'll never do buisiness with them again. a totally bad experience.

        They've been polite to me, I don't work there and I'm not going to
try to appologise for them thow.

&gt;now, i understand that any buisiness can mess up an order. but the i'm not

        Very true, It's often easier to remember when things went wrong.
Lets also try to name people when things go right (I'm lax in this area too)
i.e. I've had good luck with Import Parts Center in Medford OR (the owner is
currently restoreing a diesel westy)(legal stuff).

        Mostly, lets try not to slam every vender that appears on the list,
or none will.  This dosen't mean don't be honst.  Just try not to vent
grudges years after the fact, vent it when it happens.  

        Agin, no relation to Parts Place.  I just want to see more vendors
(good, bed , or somewhere in between) on the list.  But when someone does
screw op BLAST 'EM but blast 'em THEN.  (none of this should apply to
the,&quot;should I order from ...&quot;post, if someone asks a question, tell them
everything, both good and bad)
