Subject: Engine Hatch Seal Installation

I purchased one of the engine hatch seals from ISPWEST on Ebay.  This is for
my 71 with the removable apron.  How do people install this so that they can
remove the apron but still have the engine compartment seal?  Was it
originally installed with glue on all 4 sides, or do i cut the bottom part of
the seal from the top and sides so than the apron will be removeable?  Whats
the concensus here?

I'll be in Taos all next week. Are there any good places around there to
scavenge parts?
