Subject: bus depot...my $.05..if you care
Message-ID: &lt;58478ad1.246476d6_at_aol_dot_com&gt;

Hello to all.  Its 11 am here on Friday morning and I have 137 mails and 1/3 
of them seem to be about bus depot. Hmmm...... 

Expression, suppression, sharing of info and facts, opinions, stories and 
fables...it all seems to happen here in our computer generated, 
semi-friendship, of for sale items and getting help with tech. problems we've 
encountered while tuning our buses into show cars or daily driving, cheap, 
fun, transportation. (maybe not always cheap!!)

I have enjoyed reading all the posts.  I mean it.  One would be hard pressed 
to find at least one point that did not have merit.  Remember we all see the 
world thru different colored glasses.

&gt;from my perspective ( if you care....) ....i also own a small business( 
lawn/tree care maintenance..and all it entails).  i have had some disgruntled 
customers also.  sometimes it was my fault, at othertimes i realized i would 
not be able to please them no matter what i did.  for some i tried the best 
way i could to please them.  discounts on services are a tax write-off, so 
why not give someone a little discount to help restore your image and their 
confidence in your business.  it is quite easy to determine those who are 
only interested in complaining about something to get that free discount.  to 
those customers i politely pointed them to another company explaining 
professionally i would not be able to provide the service they desire.  
explanations are not needed to customers.  sure explaining the process of how 
i mix my chemicals and how the temp/ humidity will affect the fertilizers i 
apply to your turf means nothing to Mrs. smith if she wakes up one morning 
and her lawn is burned.  i must immediately apologize, tell her what i can 
suggest as options to repairing the damage, then let her choose what she 
would like me to do to fix this.   

i have not so far read anything from Ron about what he intends to do now or 
in the future, or did do about some of these smaller problems.  by reading 
his posts it is refreshing to detect concern to try and correct some 
communication issues, with his employees.  starting and running (profitably) 
your own business is not easy.  i personally would have been very impressed 
to see a short apology from the bus depot rather than a lengthy explanation.  
but i do realize he had the obligation to himself,to at least defend his 
actions to the public in a free and open setting.  it is very  interesting to 
me to see how much bitterness and anger can be sent to someone over just an 
opinion.  how many times have we heard someone cuss another out for cussing 
someone else out.  that's  the kind of irony anyone can see.  one gentleman 
on here felt obligated to come back on and apologize if he stepped on any 
toes.  Maybe we should all type out what we want to say and give it a quick 
reread before we hit *send* .  Possibly we will find a way to word our 
thoughts without offending or feeling we will have to apologize later. 

(digressing over)..........i wish Ron the best.  If you are not happy give 
him the opportunity to correct it.  If not happy again....welll you know the 
rest.........fool me once, shame on you...fool me twice shame on me.  Have a 
good weekend all.
