&gt; For those that were interested, I posted a picture of the adjuster here:

&gt; Scroll down to the lower picture if necessary.  Thanks to Greg Thompson
for reminding me that the adjuster is not a small screw, but rather a
&quot;nub&quot; which must be grabbed with a small pair of pliers.  The nub is sort
of the reverse of a standard slotted machine screw would be, if that
makes sense.

What year is that?  My '71 doesn't look like that at all, no little box.
It just has two terminals marked &quot;+&quot; and &quot;G&quot; with &quot;12V&quot; stamped
between the terminals
