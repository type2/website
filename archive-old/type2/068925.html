Subject: Re: Fwd: Brake shoes for &quot;71&quot; camper

71 was the first year with front disks. The rear hubs and drums changed
as well so both front and back brakes (pad and shoes repectively) are 
different.

A VW specialist may just give you what you ask for ie brakes for a 71 
type 2.

If its not a VW specialist their 'parts book' may just say up to chassis
2x0xxxxxx use part no aaaaa after 2x1xxxxxx us part no bbbbb. 
Or have you confused him by asking for brake shoes front and back for a 
71 type 2? - with disk brakes the linings are usualy refered to as pads.

Almost certainly the guy's just trying to be helpfull to make sure you 
get the right parts; so I'd just give him the number and go with the 
flow. 

Maybe the guy who knows enough to know he can go wrong is better to deal
with than the expert (at least when ordering parts)


NB parts books (even VW's own) may reference everything to a panel van
(21yxxxxxx - y is the year code and xxxxxx the running chassis) so for
non-model specific parts the first two digits may be 'ignored'.
