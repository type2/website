Subject: Clutch problem

I want to thank all who responded to my clutch questions.  I changed the
slave unit this morning with no cure of the problem.  BTW, changing the
slave was a major PITA.  Trying to hold the back bolt up while holding the
slave down &amp; starting the nut was fun.  I bleed the system 3 times with no
change.  There is no air in the system.  Tomorrow the engine is coming out.
I am hoping to get the thing out &amp; that the problem is quickly determined.
I want to put the engine back in on Tuesday.  I will keep you all informed.
