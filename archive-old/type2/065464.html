Subject: RE: Border Partings [almost No VW Content]

&gt; Since it involves a border, I feel that all countries that share that border
&gt; should be concerned.  It takes two nations to make a border.  It doesn't take
&gt; much to cause conflict between nations, even war.  I'm not trying to pull any
&gt; radical strings here.  I often get harassled just because of my vehicles, hair,
&gt; stickers, etc.

Since we are the more facist of the two on this border (usually) I think 
we need to clean our house first.

Betting your hair is no longer than mine, I get the same hassles.  I 
don't do the sticker thing though.  Just don't not a comment either way.

I have gotten searched as well.  But it is in the sports car I had not 
the Eurovan I drive (okay so I'm on both van lists....).  Running on the 
major north south routes along the East coast ina a black sports car is 
about the same as a border crossing in suspicions of drugs.  The EV must 
look like a boring old family van.  Almost insulting...

Same laws on barefoot driving/seat belts/etc (except title)

I tend not to haul folks that would get in trouble if searched.  I 
usually embarrass the cops by being EXTREMELY polite and helpful.. I 
usually get oof of the speeding or what ever else they &quot;really&quot; pulled me 
over for.

&gt;(I was going to the Rainbow Gathering, which is particularly high risk for harasslement.)

cool.
