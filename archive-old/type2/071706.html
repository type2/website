This is only a suggestion.  TAKE A LONG HARD LOOK AT HOW YOU ARE 
RUNNING YOUR BUSINESS!!!!!

You may make it for a little while on poor service and poor staffing 
but your future depends upon satisfied customers.  I have to report I 
am not among them.  I have been trying to get a problem resolved for 
over a month and a half.  After several phone calls of being put on 
ignore and 5 or more email messages,
I finally had to get the CC co. to dispute the charge to get any one 
to even respond to me.

The only reason why someone &quot;wouldn't&quot; tell you if your order had shipped
would be if you called the 800 orders-only number instead of customer
service - in which case the person indeed would not tell you, because they
simply wouldn't know!
