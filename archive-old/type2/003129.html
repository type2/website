Kind of a Friday thing... but it happend this past Monday night.  I received a call for a guy who had printed out the AIRS list to take with him on his trip.  He was looking for a safe place to park for the night.. told him he could park in my driveway, gave him directions and in just a bit he was here.. He is driving from California to eventually Alabama, just taking the back roads and siteseeing. He came in... borrowed the stove and cooked his dinner and then retired for the night in his '71VW bus.... and the next morning had breakfast with us and then was on his way.  Not too sure which way he was going. but was headed kind of south to start with... His name is Kent... he is a really nice guy and hoped to be calling on more list members during his travels.
Was glad to be able to offer a place to stay,

Subject: [T2] to panel or not to panel?


&gt; Hey everyone!
&gt; 
&gt;   Has anyone had any experience with converting a kombi to a panel? My rear side window has a ventwing. The rubber has to be replaced, but the little piece between the glass and the vent wing is almost rusted away at the bottom. I could cut it out and put solid glass in, but then again, maybe I could turn it into a panel?
&gt; 
&gt; Peace &amp; Harmony
