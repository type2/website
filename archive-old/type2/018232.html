Heh! I've some great responses to my dilema--

a) use larger hose
b) use non-petro substances (spit, detergent, KY-2K, etc.)
c) use petro substances (WD-40, wheel bearing grease)

Unfortunately they cancel each other out. So I'm just going to apply the &quot;if
it feels good, do it&quot; principle. If anything bad happens in the next 6 months,
I'll let y'all know.

(BTW, since it's Friday--next time you go to the doctor, be aware that a
&quot;digital examination&quot; is not exactly what you might think. ie, no computers
are involved.)

&gt; I would suggest KY-2K, which allows you to fit 4 digits where there is only
&gt; room for 2 digits.
