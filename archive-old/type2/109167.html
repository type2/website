&gt; 120V only.  Which is fine for the 40-ft behemoths that they are usually
mounted on since they spend 95% of their time in
parking-lot-between-the-interstate-and-railroad-tracks &quot;campgrounds&quot;.
Bleah.

Actually, I don't mind the lack of AC while driving.  But being able to
relax in comfort whilst stopped overnight sounds good.

It's just too bad that there doesn't seem to be a heater that mounts the
same way, but works while the vehicle is in motion.
