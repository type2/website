Subject: Re: [T2] fuel tank sender install was gauge won't go to 1/1

&gt; I had neither the special tool or the patience to try to get the sender out

The sender comes off with a tap of a screwdriver, rotating it slightly.

&gt; Incidently, the tank compartment looked like new inside. Like the day it
&gt; rolled off the assembly line.

Mine had a lot of road dust inside. Sometimes it's not pretty under the tank
because of the opening for the fuel lines:

&gt; I'll cut a hole in the fixed panel above the sender if I ever decide to
&gt; replace it.

This was recommended in the VW workshop manual probably because it resulted
in a low labor charge for the customer.  Doing it with the engine out is
really the best way.
 
&gt; Getting that rear firewall panel off is very taxing in my opinion, but even
&gt; that doesn't expose the sender very well.   So yes, I'd say it is going to
&gt; be an aggravating job at best.

I agree: it's only a place for small hands.  You can't see in there very
well and you need to be able to align it right to get a good seal with the
O-ring that is under the sender.  In fact, the O-ring that's there is
probably cracked from age.

Here's what an old sender can look like:

Eddie,

Since you are used to pulling engines, go that route and give your yourself
the most flexibility, literally, to get everything behind the firewall
perfect again.

I think either way, working with the engine in or pulling the engine to get
at the tank is going to take the same amount of time but you are dead right
about the aggravation part if you leave the engine in.
