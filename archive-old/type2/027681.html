Subject: Loose nuts

Hi All,

I had a kind of strange experience this past weekend. I was driving my 70
Westy down on Cape Cod Saturday when I suddenly felt and heard a banging
noise coming from the front end. Oh great, I think, It must be a wheel
bearing gone or maybe the bearing retainer nut has backed off. I pull over
to the first available spot and check things out. The left front wheel has
all the studs backed out quite far. Now, I had done some brake work on the
front end about 1k miles ago, and I am sure that I tightened everything back
up when I was done. I am picky about things like that. Has anyone else had
this happen to them? Not that I'm paranoid, but it just seemed strange that
all of them were out so far. I only drive it on the weekends, and I think I
will check them before every trip. Any tips for keeping them tight? 

Thanks

Jeff
