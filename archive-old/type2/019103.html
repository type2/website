&gt; &gt; I own a 1976 VW westy and I need to haul a trailer behind it.

&gt; I was thinking the same thing myself and after searching the
&gt; archives, found this message from list member Jon :

&gt; This seems to be the only option for late model loaf owners who want
&gt; to tow a *small* trailer. The next link is to order the hitch.
&gt;
&gt; http://www.hitch-web_dot_com/dalan.asp
&gt;
&gt; or to contact the manufacturer directly (Da'lan Hitches, Shirley, MA)
&gt;
&gt; http://www.thehitch_dot_com/  they have a 800 number.
&gt;
&gt; I haven't ordered one myself, but it's on my &quot;to do&quot; list.
&gt;

    I bought the Da'lan Hitch while setting up the Auto Parts store where I
worked as a dealer...  Fits my '73 Westy automatic just fine...

This bolts to bottom of bumper (I did a little improvement here by
reinforcing the bumper bottom with 1/16&quot; steel plate), then steps down a bit
and forward to attach to rear engine crossmember... I have towed beetles up
to 40-50 mile with no problems...

    The folks at Da'lan are very helpful and are usually open to any
modifications you might want (I've been asking for a receiver type hitch
rather than a fixed tongue).

    As I bought the Adjust-a-ball set-up (1 7/8&quot; &amp; 2&quot; balls) the wiring
converter and the hitch all at once they gave me a really great price (plus a
small discount  for starting up a new account)...  The whole set-up cost me
right at $125...

    Overall I'm very pleased with this company...  No longer associated with
the above un-named Parts store or Da'lan, so I have no interests other than
as a Very satisfied customer...
