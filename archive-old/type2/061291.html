Subject: 71 brake booster mod

Have a 71 bus (160K). It has disks on the front and a brake booster (all
stock). Just put new front calipers on because the pedal was not comming
back up. This fixed the sticking. This car has never stopped
particularly well, but I believe all the parts are working as they
should (dont know about the pres. regulator). I had heard there was a
way to modify a valve/disk inside the brake booster to enhance the power
assist. Anyone?
