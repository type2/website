 &gt; Hey Volks-
 &gt; 	I've got a 1600 DP with 8,000 miles on it.  I went out yesterday and
 &gt; started it and smoke pored out of the tail pipe.  It was oil.  Does
 &gt; anybody have any idea why this happened?  It only does it on initial
 &gt; start up after that its fine.  I hope it is due to my faulty fuel pump
 &gt; but I dont know?  Thanks for your help.
 &gt; 
 &gt; 
 &gt; Which color is the smoke that comes out of your tailpipe? Oilsmoke is 
usually kind of grey-whiteish. I guess that when it's not a broken ring it 
maybe just be a simple carb question. When the smoke has a blue like color 
instead of gray it might be just too much fuel inside the intake manifolds, 
that is burned at the start up, it burns so much fuel that it drowns the 
engine. And the fuel cannot be burned totally, then when the engine get's 
hot it can handle those amounts of fuel cause the fuel burns easier due to 
the heat. That's why you don't se the smoke when you engine run's at normal 
operating temperatures. In case it would  be a ring or something exposed to 
mecanical action, you would get more smoke in relation to more heat and more 
rev's. And you aparently don't!
Don't worry, just check your mixture of the carb or the amount of fuel flow 
injected (in case you have an injection) and set it right
