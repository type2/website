Subject: RE: [T2] Fuel Flow/MPG Meter?

You can have one.... JC Whipme used to sell a kit that was called a
&quot;trip computer&quot; (I think).  One part was installed in the fuel line and
another was installed in the speedometer cable. I bought one a few years
ago and will get around to installing it, probably this decade. I don't
know if this item is still in their catalog. TBear

Don't take life to seriously--you'll never live through it.
