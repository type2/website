Subject: Rear Brakes slight cavitation and Compression Test Results

Well I got my 82 Vanagon Westy back from the wrench yesterday.  Front 
bearings repacked, new rear brakes and drums turned, and a compression check that he 
says is very good. 115, 130, 110, 130.  Does that sound ok with that much 
variation between cylinders?  The vehicle has a slight feel of warped rotors that 
I have experienced before in a passat that had 4wheel disk brakes and the 
fronts were warped and replaced by the dealer.    Wondering if the drums can warp 
or if they need to be re-turned or replaced.  I want to wait to hear from you 
good folks before I go back in with the vehicle for him to check the brakes 
again.

Chuck
