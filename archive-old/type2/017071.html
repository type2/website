Subject: Yoko tires

Greetings fellow list members,
What a relief to have our daily digest back. In the Arctic (-37C today),
the list is my only link to the outside world. I was finally able to
find those famous Yoko 370s LT195-75-14 for the camper in Canada. I had
to call Yokohama directly in British Columbia as the dealers I contacted
apparently did not want my cash. Not cheap though. Listed at $139.70
each (that's in Canadian pesos!) not mounted, even with the dollar
conversion it does not compare with Tire Rack's (US$59) or Sears'
(US$51) mentioned by some listees a few days ago. On top of the weather,
that's another thing to be envious about. Unless a list member north of
the border knows of a better deal, I guess I'll have to feed the kids
canned sardines and Kr*ft diners for a while to pay for them tires.

1972 High Top Camper (Nuna-bus, still in Quebec, the only one I love!)
1997 Cherokee (daily driver, the office pays for it!)
1996 Touring SLE (too cold to ride until May)
1996 Honda Fourtrax (can't wait for the summer...late July)
+ snowmobile and ATV carcasses around the iglu, typical of an arctic
dweller
