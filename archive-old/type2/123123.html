&gt; &gt; Guess what : the intake lifter on cylinder #3 was as solid as a rock.
&gt; The cylinder wall and head were black &gt;with soot.

&gt; Ben,, I am certainly no expert on hydraulic lifters,, but when I bled a
&gt; couple of sets here,, I found that a Rock solid lifter is GOOD....

yup the only lifter in many years to go bad broke a spring and was so soft
it wouldn't open the valve.

&gt; These lifters need to be bled..... i found that if your not carefull when
&gt; your bleeding them,. they will become so SOLID that you can't get the
&gt; circlip in,, and you have to start over again,,,

&gt; If you had bad lifters,, the engine would knock, it would be noisy,,,

or the cyl wouldn't fire because the valve wasn't opening

&gt; &gt; I bought a replacement set of lifters from CB Performance (their so
&gt; called high speed ones) and hope that those will run better.
&gt; 
&gt; One thing that seems to be very common is rapid wear on NEW lifters put
&gt; into an engine with the existing cam,, as the cam and the lifters are not
&gt; a matched hardness,, the harder one will rapidly wear the softer one..

it shouldn't be a problem if it is a BRAND NEW NEVER USED lifter, since
they are made to work harden as they break in.    lifter that have already
been used cause the problems.
