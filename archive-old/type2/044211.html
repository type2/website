Subject: [T2] Proper paint color for my bus

Hi everyone, I have printed out the list of paint codes from the
technical page, but now I need to know where I look to find them on my
bus?  I know that the green part (bottom half) is sage green, but the
upper part which is white could be one of two whites, depending on when
she was manufactured. Also, where is the best type of place to go to get
good quality paint and what kind of words do I use to specify what I
want to the people who work there, if you get what I mean?  I assume I
will not be going to Pep Boys, or something in that vein!  thanks, Beth
and the Hippychickmobile in NJ
