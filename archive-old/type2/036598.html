Subject: Re: good battery brands?

&gt;So it looks as though I'm in the market for batteries.
&gt; Before I head on down to Sears,  does anyone have good or bad experiences
&gt; with various brands to share?  Does any  brand beat the odds and give a
&gt; good unit every time?

I've had extremely good luck with the AutoZone battery line.  I have
installed AutoZone batteries in almost every vehicle I've owned (Nissan,
Beetle, Datsun, Dodge, Nissan again, Bus), with no regrets, returns or
problems.  The bus runs one now that is 6.5 years old, having been installed
by the PO and left to sit for two years after he lost interest.  It always
starts up reliably (knock wood) and charges well.

And this is not just a secondhand recommendation.  Consumer Reports (like
them or not) always rates the AutoZone just as high or higher than
Interstate, DieHard, Exide and others.  And it's usually cheaper for the
same battery.

But your mileage may vary.  Buying any consumer product is a crap shoot.
I'd probably just buy the cheapest one, but I'm a born cheapskate.
