To all my fellow scavengers......er, I mean, &quot;recyclers, restorers,
rescuers.&quot;

Next weekend I will be on the road in the wide open spaces of the mid-west.
Anyone know of any good boneyards? I just don't feel like I've been on
vacation if I haven't spent at least a few hours climbing through twisted
heaps of former road glory.

My route is basically I75 from Lexington, KY to Detroit, MI. I can also go
through eastern and/or southern IN. I'm always looking for a few good parts
(who isn't?).

Any suggestions will be appreciated.

Thanks,
Dave
