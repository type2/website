I tend to agree with you, next time you change your oil do the old boiling
water test to see if it is off by much (they are all off a little I
suspect)

heat guns and VW's do not go well together as the system is designed to
cool down fast. unlike a water cooled system.

go on a stiff drive and have him waiting in the driveway with his heat gun
and I bet you get a very different reading
