&gt; Cool, thanks for the info. Would you know which tube it goes through so I do

&gt; If so, I shouldnt have to touch it to do cross-members, or do I?
&gt; Thanks,

Dave,

The tube that carries the main wiring harnes from the engine compartment,
does go thru the frame members as I remember (it's been 5-6 years :-).  
It is about an inch in diameter and goes down to the right of the main
heater tube, looking forward. On mine, the tube was about 60% missing
because of rust, so preservation was not possible, but a run of (?3/4&quot; or
was it 1'?)  thinwall electrical conduit contained the harness nicely.  
As I remember, I had the engine and trans out and fed the tube in from the
rear, but I would really want to go home and look before I got definite[1]
The body I am talking about is a '73, BTW.  One thing fersure, if you have
a different year, you may have a different arrangement
