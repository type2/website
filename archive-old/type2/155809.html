Subject: Re: [T2] Re: VWoA still being VWoA

&gt; Don, can you pmail me a scan or a pic of your letter?
&gt; Or even better, a pic of you, with your letter,
&gt; standing infront of your bus, wearing your shirt.
&gt;
I'm still waiting for the actual letter. All I have now is the email from CP.

I never ordered one of my own shirts. I was working on one that looks
like my bus. In fact I sold exactly zero products with the bus on it.
heh. (Not that it matters legally...)

It was a fun project for me, showed my own small social commentary,
and I was hoping to pick up a few dollars to put into the Guac.

BTW: if you look at my site, I found a pic of the Guac and the GWB
next to each other. I stumbled on it when I was looking for a good pic
to use for my fair use example. Yes, that's my fat butt with the ATV
jack...
