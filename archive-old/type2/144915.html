&gt; Hi,

&gt; Home again... for a short time. And working on the type-2 1969 bus again. I
&gt; managed to replace the generator... I am proud I have done the whole job
&gt; without any problem... Exept for now: I lifted the fan cover as per Muir,
&gt; now I want to fix it again with the two bolts left and right... but I cannot
&gt; reach the hole of the left bolt. It was difficult to remove it so it is not
&gt; a surprise... I tried and tried but my fingers are not long enough. Any tips
&gt; or tricks?

Another place where Muir didn't know everything!  I can't help you in your
present situation, but next time leave the shroud alone and remove the fan
from the front (FIF) side of the shroud and remove the generator without
lifting the shroud.

&gt; The old generator's axis is worn out. Can I replace it myself? Does it need
&gt; major overhaul in a shop?

If the shaft is bad, a rebuilt generator is probably indicated.  Might be
a good time to consider swapping to a late model alternator.
