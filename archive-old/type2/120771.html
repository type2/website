Subject: 2.0L rebuild question

I've decided to go ahead and give my newest project a fresh rebuild.  This is my first time.  I'm about th split case.  This brings me to my question.  I noticed that the connecting rods have a lot of play in them.  should they be like that? and what is the anticipated amout of movement?
Thanks Mike
