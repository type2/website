Subject: liquid cooled list?

Hi, Please excuse the lack of bus content. I have a friend who is as crazy
about the VW water cooled world as I am about type 2's. I know a lot of bus
owners have liquid cooled VW's too. Is anyone aware of a similar list to
this one for Golf etc enthusiasts? If so please email me details so I can
forward them. Bob
