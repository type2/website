Here's a few more:

People stopping by at 7:30 AM Saturday morning to
ask me if I'm interested in selling any of my VWs (just
2, no junkyard here)

Finding out *after* aquiring your first type 2 that it has many
1 year only parts and they cost 3x what previous years cost
(At this time I'd like to thank my good buddy Scott for the=20
freebie 78 FI engine :-)

Getting lectures from the drivers of gas guzzling super-tanker
urban assualt vehicles about how unsafe it is for me to ferry
my kids around in my type 2. (One person said &quot;Imagine if MY car
ran into yours broad-side...&quot;  My reply was &quot;Maybe if you pull over
when you use your cell-phone that won't happen...&quot;  She wasn't =
amused...)=20

PS- My goal is to get my bus running for the Phil &amp; Friends show
in Raliegh next month.  When I used to tour, I always wanted a bus
and had intended to get one, 1995 changed all that and my focus returned
to type 1s.  Now I have one, and I'm damned determined to get there
if I have to drag it up there...
