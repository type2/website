Subject: Free 78 bus FI system

Back when I owned a 79 bus converted to a weber progressive/009, I had dreams of
returning the car to its original FI system.  To that end, I stripped the FI from a 78
van (and gave the engineless van to someone who put his engine in it and continued to
run it) and put all the FI parts into a box and put the box in my mother's basement in
Boston.  The 78 was running at the time, and I tried hard to get all the parts, so I
think its all there.  The box full of FI stuff is still in the basement, and its time
to get rid of it (79 van long gone, 70 van doesn't need it).  I will be visiting my
mother soon, and could arrange to ship the FI system, although I would prefer to have
someone come by and pick it up.

I would like to give this system to someone who intends to use it to replace a carb
conversion.  I have no idea of the value of the FI system, but if you are not in
Boston, you'll have to pay shipping.  I would prefer not to give the system away to
someone just looking for spares (although that is a perfectly legitimate purpose).

In the basement in Boston, I also have an exhaust system (1 piece, very good
condition) that bolts onto 78 heater boxes and eliminates some complicated, expensive,
and legally required exhaust parts.  Free to any taker.  I also have some (3 or 4?)
spare rims that fit my 79.  There are tires on the rims, but I doubt they are any
good.  Also free to any taker.  The last two items must be picked up in Boston.

If anyone is interested, please let me know.  Thanks,
