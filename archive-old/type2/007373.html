73 Westy FS.  Just passed PA state inspection.  Inspection is good 
through 4/2000.   Has new rear brake shoes, hardware, wheel cylinders, 
metal lines.  Has new front pads, rubber lines, metal lines.  Just tuned 
up.  Has dual Webers and an 009, not by me.  Runs good.  Has some rust 
underneath on the drives side rockers and some surface rust.  The van is 
a Westfailia, but has an aftermarket pop-top that goes straight up.  
Will need new heat exchangers if you expect heat.  Interior is in good 
shape.
$1800 OBO.
John
