Subject: [T2] Bus driving,and...73 a good year? 

 Hi folks;
   Wanted to take a moment to ramble about something.  I have been a VW fan 
for many years ( I feel old,having said that) and until this year, have owned 
only beetles and a Thing.  This year, we bought our first bus.  If  I had 
only known years ago, what GREAT fun driving a bus was/is....... 
    Having realized this, we have put our 74 bug up for sale, to replace it 
with a Westy.  Before I get to my question- I wanna take a moment and say a 
big THANK YOU to the folks that post the classifieds from their area. Up here 
in Wisconsin, buses are relatively rare. There is almost never a bus listed 
in any local paper here. Seeing and learning the value of these great 
machines in other areas is great. Not to mention that we may end up 
purchasing one from afar anyhow.
     The one westy that has caught my eye locally is a 73 that came from the 
south recently. It is very solid, but does NOT run or drive, and thus needs 
lots o'  mechanical attention, to say the least. The price is very attractive 
 (cheap).
     My question is:   Are there any particular disadvantages to a 73 model, 
compared to any other year?  I'm talking mechanically, not the camper part. 
Is there a better year to look for in a bay window Westy?  I realize the 2.0 
engines are stronger, but do the extra sensors, fuel injection, etc.  make it 
more hassle too? 
    Any opinions, etc, appreciated of course.
   P.S. If you need/ want a 74 superbeetle, email me for specifics off the 
list
  Thanks
