Both the Vanagon engines I have torn down (well.... one's partially 
assembled now) had windage trays.  To me, the windage tray looks to be an 
oil pickup tube that reaches into the sump, with an inverted metal &quot;bowl&quot; 
down at the pickup end.  I suppose if the oil level in the sump was high 
enough to cover the hole that the &quot;upper&quot; end of the windage tray pipe 
goes into, the oil pump could suck oil even with the tray missing.

None of the manuals I have shows a picture of the windage tray, but at 
least one of them (Haynes??) mentions it.

&gt; windage tray really required?
