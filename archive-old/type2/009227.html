I find this (suggesting we not allow customer complaints) scary, frankly. I
read this list to get information. If there is a business I'm thinking of
ordering from, I'd like to know of the problems customers have had. I would
think that would be a *function* of this list, not something to be
discouraged. How else are you supposed to know about a company if not from
other people that have dealt with it? Yes, this list reaches lots of people,
which is why it's so important to share this information. 

It isn't as if Ron Salmon has no defense. He posted tonight about the
complications he was having, and I was glad to hear his side of the story. I
believe him to be an honest and sincere person, from reading his posts. If
anything, this is a way for him to be aware of the public image Bus Depot
develops, and help shape it as time goes on. It wouldn't be fair for him to
be able to talk about the business without other people being able to talk
about their dealings with it. 

Finally, the post I have quoted below seems to suggest that by talking about
problems some have had with Bus Depot that people are making personal
attacks against Ron Salmon, but this is simply not the case. Talking about
problems with a company does not suggest the owner is bad, it just means
there might be some problems to look into. I'm sure now that Ron is aware of
these very specific complaints, he'll have a better idea of what to tackle
when he's making his business better. I have never ordered from Ron's
business (I've never ordered parts by mail), but I would be more likely to
check him out now that I know he's aware of concerns I might have, and will
be ready to deal with them. 

I once posted a review of a wedding photography service on my web page. The
review was negative, as the service was terrible. The review was fair and
not at all an attack, and everything I said the photographer had done was
recorded on our wedding video. Instead of talking to their customer about
it, as Ron has done, they tried to sue me. They had no case, and eventually
called off the dogs, but I have lost all respect for the way they do
business. I think the way Ron has responded to these complaints has been
wonderful, and will help the business much more than if people were not
allowed to report any problems they had. 

Thanks,

&gt; Although this list should not infringe upon someone's first amendment
&gt;rights,  I believe there should be some policy concerning the use of the
&gt;list to post negative comments which surely have a far reaching effect on
&gt;someone's livelihood.
