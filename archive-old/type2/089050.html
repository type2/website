Subject: Re: [T2] fuse block info needed

[...]

Is there a part number on the fuse box?
The 72 box should be 411 937 505C. [70 was A and 71 was B]
I am wondering how someone can fit a 73 box up above the headlight?
VW made the boxes bigger in 73 when they moved it down to the middle under the
dash. This coincided with the turnsignals moving up above the headlights.
I don't remember seeing any markings on the back of the boxes.


&gt; Was  assisting on a wiring call  and during troubleshooting  realized
&gt; that  i was looking at a  73 fuse panel and wiring patched into a 72
&gt; bus.  PO had also left a lot of wires hanging.  What i need is a chart
&gt; that shows me the terminal designations on the back side of the fuse
&gt; panel. In all of my tons of info here i cant locate a  simple picture to
&gt; show what terminal is what.  I can see no terminal designations marked
&gt; on the panel.  The fuse panel appeared to be relatively new and is
&gt; probably a  replacement fuse panel.
