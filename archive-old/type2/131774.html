Subject: Re: [T2] Part # for Sealing Ring behind Fan Hub

&gt;From: scott lyons

&gt; &gt; I am looking for the Part # for the Small sealing ring that goes behind 
&gt;the
&gt; &gt; Fan Hub.

&gt;021 119 125 A

Thanks Scott! This is what I was looking for, but unlike some of the better 
vendors out there, that I don't live near they don't have it in stock. 3-5 
days for an O-ring. I really wanted to get it today and get moving on this 
thing.

Does anyone have the &quot;Nomenclature of this Seal&quot; Diameter, thickness, grade, 
etc.? It would really help out a lot.


Thanks,
Michael Knight
