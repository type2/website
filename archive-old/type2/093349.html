Subject: RE: [T2] VW Trends Turbo Articles


&gt;To be meaningful, these comparisons need to be made with the fans mounted
&gt;on an engine.  I'm sure that the 911 fan will move a lot more air in its
&gt;&quot;free air&quot; state, but when it comes to pushing the air through the finning
&gt;I doubt that it makes much difference.

You can get an idea of the CFM output of the 911 fan from 
www.pelicanparts_dot_com I THINK.

They have alot of good Porsche tech there.

There is a good Porsche book called Performance Porsche by a fellow named 
Bruce something. I have it at home and can look it up.
