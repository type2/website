Subject: Germany trip report + oil cooler query

John, et al, I got back from Germany visiting my Berlin based sister a
week ago, and drove enough in 14 days (in a Golf) for 6 tankfuls at like
80 marks per.  The Golf is pretty peppy (yes I was doing 160kph) and
steers nicely.  Did hit Wolfsburg, and visited Martin Peitz, who is on
this list and just moved back after 5 yrs in the States. I couldn't
believe his full collection of all VW manuals.  He bought a defunct
winery (buildings) and has lots of room to weld VW busses.   I saw about
2 bay busses, one splitty,  and lots of Vanagons (at least 2 an hour),
virtually all with high-tops.  The vacationers must dust off the
campers, for they were out in force visiting the north shore.  Drove
through Switzerland also, where there are van campers I never heard of
(Renault?).  I did take my tent, but at the value of the dollar, I could
stay in nice hotels with full breakfast for less than what the full
service campgrounds cost here! 
Bus  content- my high milage Westy has developed a significant leak that
looks like oil cooler- looking at a parter engine, it looks pretty tough
to do the cooler disengaging with engine in- has anyone done this and
can claim it was easier??   MB 78 Westy

&gt; Well the short form at least regarding Wolfsburg. I had been warned and
&gt; it comes to bear that the new Autostadt (sp?) display is pretty lame, and
&gt; it is. Now I don't speak a word of German but from looking at people and
&gt; body language it seems to me that it is pretty lame to all. Problem is the
&gt; following you got to do it to see a number of cars that used to be in the
&gt; museum (the car display in the first building on the left is the only one
&gt; worth looking at, well the commercial truck display is OK too.) But hey it's
&gt; only $12 so don't fret too much, just don't blow that much time anywhere
&gt; else there. You also have to do it to take the plant tour (you ride in a
&gt; little
&gt; train thing) which is pretty cool, takes an hour, available in English, all
&gt; in all
&gt; worth the $12 I guess.
&gt; 
&gt; Now the real museum, here is where it gets good, the transporter highlights
&gt; IMHO, the 1st handbuilt prototype. A number of fire trucks of various years.
&gt; The only surviving '78 syncro westy prototype, which I took scores of
&gt; pictures
&gt; of how they did (oh some day folks, I've got a lot of the parts already.)
&gt; This
&gt; bus was the highlight for me as it is what I went to look at. Oddly it is NOT
&gt; the yellow bus that was pictured on Derek's old syncro website. It is a beige
&gt; '78, and is really beat to a pulp and badly rusted, somebody (program
&gt; manager?)
&gt; must have enjoyed the heck out of this thing. It rolls on 7x16 truck tires
&gt; that
&gt; fit under the stock bodywork with a bit of a lift. Uses U-joints and
&gt; splined slider
&gt; axle shafts not CV's. A regular 091 nose shifted tranny modified for power
&gt; takeoff. A one off front diff for all I can tell, probably housing a stock
&gt; T2 R&amp;P
&gt; by the size of it. The steering was able to remain which suprised me but
&gt; I couldn't tell/see how cause a massive skidplate under the front. T4
&gt; engined,
&gt; could not tell what type or induction (decklid locked, but hey I opened up
&gt; the
&gt; one on a GAS TURBINE bay for a pic) drum brakes all round. The rear axle
&gt; was deeply U'd in the center to accomadate the power take off. A '67 bay
&gt; with splitty front end etc, probably about the oldest bay existant? Lots of
&gt; neat
&gt; vanagons, a leather interior lengthened luxury '98 south american bus still
&gt; pushed by a 1600 amazingly enough. Other commercial VW's. And of course
&gt; tons of bugs, polo's, passats (the 1st), scirrocos, jetta (the first), and
&gt; a bunch
&gt; of neat prototypes (the T3 ghia prototype uglier than even the production
&gt; version if that is possible.) A 4wd '46 sedan, a kubel and a schwim, but the
&gt; example in the Deutche Museum in Munich was better ( a GREAT museum,
&gt; the German &quot;Smithsonian&quot; with great car, aircraft, machinery, sections, the
&gt; highlight of the trip actually. Neat stainless steel 911, 959 pan and
&gt; drivetrain,
&gt; MBZ SS from the day, 300 SLK, auto union racers, and a whole bunch of
&gt; cool cars.)
&gt; 
&gt; Anyway I'd plan at least 2 hours in the real museum, and maybe an 2 in the
&gt; car and commercial portions of the Autostadt if I needed to do it again,
&gt; with an
&gt; hour for the factory tour as well. Someone interested in bugs might take a
&gt; lot
&gt; longer, I looked at them quickly. One last highlight of the Autostadt was
&gt; the fact
&gt; that incredible rubber floormats for the EV were only $36 the set, with nice
&gt; prices on mats for all cars, and mudflaps as well. Unfortunately no Vanagon
&gt; mats. Wolfsburg is in the middle of absolutely nowhere as well, there is
&gt; nothing
&gt; in the middle north worth seeing on a short trip and you are still too far
&gt; away
&gt; from the maritime museums up at the port cities. But it is well enough
&gt; situated
&gt; between the Rhein valley and Berlin. I was based out of Frankfurt and did
&gt; it on
&gt; a day trip leaving early and getting back late, would have been better to
&gt; have
&gt; gone up, stayed somewhere, and just continued on the way to Berlin, wouldn't
&gt; be out of the way then.
&gt; 
&gt; All in all pretty cool to see the 4 smokestacks of the old powerplant for
&gt; yourself.
&gt; Somewhat awe inspiring in a corney VW sort of way.
&gt; 
&gt; FWIW on the rest of the trip saw no more than 10 bays, 10 bugs, few Vanagons
&gt; even oddly enough as well. I take it the TUV gets stuff more than about 12
&gt; years
&gt; old off the roads. As a rule across the board Germans were not driving
&gt; anything
&gt; older than late 80's. Apparently if you want something cheap you buy a VW
&gt; Lupo
&gt; or Opel Corsa or whatever, but you buy it new.
