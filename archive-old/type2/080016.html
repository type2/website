Subject: t4 heat exchanger help needed


Folks,

ok!, ifinally got the new fuel pump on my 78 stock bus tonight.

Seems to start quicker and rev better, but I haven't taken it out for a
ride yet because.....while I was there(on the 3/4 side) I started looking
at the heat exchanger and the pipe up to the heater &quot;valve&quot;.

If you remember, I was having a problem with it dying(no power) after
about 3-4 miles(or when sufficiently warmed up).

The pipe that attaches to the heat exchanger has a clamp spotwelded to
it.  The pipe was loose(as in flapping in the air) while the clamp was
tight.  I finally got the clamp loosened up, but can't figure out if the
pipe slides down over the pipe that comes from the heat exchanger or not.

If it is a &quot;butt&quot; fit, the clamp is waaaay to small to grab both the pipe
it is on and the heat exchanger pipe and form a good seal.  I would want a
clamp like on a t1 engine where the fresh air enters the heat exchanger.


There were remanants of some sort of &quot;rubber&quot; seal inside the pipe going
up to the heater &quot;valve&quot;.  

Can someone who has seen one of these in proper shape tell me what it is
supposed to look like and how it should truely fit?  Where the clamp is
spotwelded doe not appear to let the other pipe meet up with it very well.

I am about ready to take the *very* thin spotwelded clamp off and use a T1
*wide* clamp if it is supposed to be a &quot;butt&quot; connection.

Anyone?

Cheers, dave
