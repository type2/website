Found a 71 sitting in an auction yard on consignment.
It has one of the quickest paint jobs on it, the guy should have bought a
full roll of masking tape.......at least he could have reached the edges of
the window seals.
It appears to have been originally all white. Now it is red and white. Top
is white, red up to the bottom edge of the middle roll section except for
the nose.....the A pillars are red to the gutter!
Appears to have the original dual port engine with the correct 71-only upper
front tin.
Has 3/4 middle seat w/correct rubber mat.
Has the flip down rear seat.
Has a Westy jalousie window on the drivers side, incorrect....
Judging from the strange mount on the front bumper, it probably spent a lot
of time behind a motor home.
Has the rear bumper but a little tweaked.
Nit sure where it came from but the only minus thing I noticed was the front
floor, passenger side is swiss cheese from rust. But only spent about 5
minutes doing a visual observation.
Talked to the old man running the place: The owner drove it in, he lives
about 35 miles away, is moving to Oregon, is in Oregon right now, can't take
it with him yada yada yada......
I asked if it would be auctioned off at the next auction, Sunday at 9:30 am,
and he said ''No, not unless the owner called and said to auction it''.
Price right now is $850. It may drop over time......or it may be sold right
away.....or it may be auctioned.....
It is at the auction yard south of Fresno, on 99 and Adams Ave.
