Subject: RE: [T2]  How do you buy a new/old Beetle from Mexico?

The price is $11,500 (add $1300 for AC)
http://www.btlmex_dot_com/vehicles.htm
The company use to have FAQ on how they did it. If I remember correctly they
basically, find an old vin number from a dead beetle here in the
states...they ship the frame to mexico, refurbish just the frame and then
slap on the new beetle parts and engine...from what I have heard they are
able to register them.

Part of it is protectionist legislation for domestic production, and some
of it is safety. Quite a few models of mainstream cars and a few low
production independants aren't up to donating four vehicles for crash
testing in addition to the smog tests...
