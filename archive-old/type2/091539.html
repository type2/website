&gt; On my '81 Vanagon the door sticker reads:

&gt; 185 R 14 C 6PR   33/48
&gt; 185 SR 14 reinf.    33/40
&gt; while the '82 Westy's sticker reads:
&gt; 185 R 14 6PR       33/40
&gt; What I have on the Westy are Uniroyal Laredos which read:
&gt; LT 195/75R14  93/900 M+S  Load Range C
&gt; So:
&gt; Are the Laredos &quot;up to spec&quot; for the Westfalia?  I'm thinking the answer is
&gt; &quot;No&quot;, but I'm not sure.

Not strong enough.  The key number is the &quot;maximum load&quot; number on the
sidewall, which as I recall is too low on the tires you mention.  It
should be at least 1540 pounds and the Laredos are about 1400 pounds.

That being said, the tires you have are a lot better than the passenger
rated tires some folks are running!  I bought two of the Uniroyals before
I got wise and now use them for spares.  Since they are M/S rated and the
bridgestones are not, I carry them along when I head for snow country.
They should also make good tires for chains as they are slightly smaller
than the 185R14s.

&gt; If  they're not up to snuff I can move the Bridgestone 603V Load Range D
&gt; tires I have on the Vanagon over to the Westy, but should I limit pressure
&gt; to 33/40 or go up to the 33/48 I have in them now?

Use the pressures on the data plate behind the seat.
