Subject: Re: [T2] swivel foot adjusters?

To use swivel feet, you must get rid of the large diameter rocker shafts
that you have stock, and opt for 1.7 only rockers with 8mm adjusting
screws..By doin g this you can use any type 1 adjuster....I highly
recommeend facing the surface of the rcoker, at the valve adjuster a full
.060 to all ow for more adjustability..

The only valve adjusters we use with these are Genuine 911 the aftermarkets
just don't make it, even Berg has problems.. Be sure and soak them in oil a
solid day prior to assembling the engine, to lube the ball/socket
well...They seldom alter rocker geometry, as no major adjustments have been
amade, and all ratios are the same..

Subject: [T2] swivel foot adjusters?


&gt;
&gt; hello all. does anyone out there know where I might get my greasy little
&gt; mitts on a set of swivel foot, or is it feet or perhaps footi ;) adjusters
&gt; for a '78 2L FI engine with hydro lifters? Anybody see a reason why I
&gt; shouldn't use them if they are available? Guess I'll also need to know
where
&gt; to get the shims/spacers/etc..to keep the VT geometry correct, right?
&gt; Thanks,
