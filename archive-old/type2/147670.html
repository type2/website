Subject: 40 days and 40 nights...

It's not quite an event of biblical proportions, but nonetheless I'll  
send out a reminder that it is only 40 days and nights until the  
Burrito Breakfast begins (begats?)  at Buses Of The Corn 2005.

So please allow me get a bit preachy:

Thou shalt attend in thy bus.
August 5-7, 2005. Brooklin, Ontario, just east of Toronto. Less than  
3 hours from Buffalo and only slightly further from the border  
crossing in Gananoque.

Thou shalt not miss thine opportunity to partake in the Frisbee Golf,  
Bus Driving Challenge, Tie Dye Workshop and Campfire Celebrations.

Thou shalt remember:
The swap meet tables are not really the same as money-changers in a  
temple. Those buses died so that others might live.

Thou shalt Do unto others as you would have others do unto you:
The nicer the stuff everyone brings to the Burrito Breakfast, the  
better the meal will be. And feel free to bring something along for  
the door prize pile if you can.

Thou shalt not covet they neighbour's bus.
It ain't about trailer queens, brethren; it's about campin!  Fire up  
that war-torn splitty; the beater breadloaf or the vandalized vanagon  
or utilitarian eurovan and bring them on up to the best darn campout  
that Brooklin Ontario has to offer. We've got buses coming in from  
all over the place, and this years event is shaping up to be the best  
ever!


Thou shalt point thy browser at www.busesofthecorn_dot_com for more  
details, or drop an email to greg_at_pottsfamily_dot_ca




Happy trails,
