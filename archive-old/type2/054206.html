Subject: Fuel Venting

Hello there,

Firstly a thanks to all who replied to my Twin-Plugging question.
Looking in the back of my 1972 camper i see that the pipe fom the fuel vent 
tee-connector to the air filter is missing, how crucial to smooth running is 
a complete connection, and more importantly is there any kind of fire risk? 
I havn't found areplacement yet, if i make something up myself how important 
are the internal diameters, which at the tee-connector appear to be tiny?

Thanks  Alister,  London.
