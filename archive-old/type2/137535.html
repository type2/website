Subject: Another dizzy question

Volks,

My stock DVDA dizzy died recently and I installed a bug dizzy I had as a 
spare (until Santa hopefully brings me a new SVDA or equivalent).  I then 
had a big flat spot - the bus would have no power until 3,000rpm and then 
it would take off like a rocket (well, relatively speaking!).  I unhooked 
the vac advance and revved it with the timing light on and  I am getting NO 
mechanical advance at all until about 3,000rpm.

My question is, is this normal for a Bug dizzy?  I looked it up at one time 
and I think it was for a 74-ish bug and I am not using the vac retard.

If it's not normal, what are the chances I could &quot;weaken&quot; a spring to get a 
more acceptable advance kick-in?  The dizzy is one of the few parts of my 
bus that I have not disassembled multiple times.

Thanks,

-David
