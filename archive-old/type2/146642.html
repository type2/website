Subject: Re: [T2] new bus depot sink faucet may not fit certain buses 
  and upgrades

Are you talking about the stem that sticks up.. the part that you turn?  
There's an o-ring in there but it's probably worn out a bit.  You can 
unscrew the bottom of the faucet underneath the stem, pull the stem out 
and grease the o-ring that way.

Also, the problem with the old faucets is that they leak from 
underneath.. and as my research has found, there's no easy way to fix that..
