Subject: Rocker remedy

List,

Rather that just install new, standard dishtop pistons in my engine(no $$$), i
decided to use my good dometops and raise the deck height to lower the
compression ratio to stock bus type4 specs. Scroll down to &quot;COMPENSATING FOR
PISTON DOME AND PISTON DISH WITH CYLINDER SHIMS IN 93MM CYLINDER&quot; on
http://www.angelfire_dot_com/ky/fecesdiary/VW.html to see a bit of an explaination
of this.

I'm gonna use a .060&quot; shim under each cylinder to do this.

This change in height increases the distance between the pushrod and the
rocker arm which will change the way the adjuster meets the valve-  not to
mention the oil-sensitive relationship between the rocker and the p-rod. 
Gotta do somethin' bout that.

So, rather than shave the heads (rocker pedestals) .060&quot; or build custom
length pushrods, i was thinking maybe i'd give it a cam with enough lift to
compensate for the change in deck height.

So, i guess one question is, what would you do if you were on a very limited
budget;

1. custom pushrods

2. shave rocker pedestals

3. high lift cam - hopefully ramp and duration specs stay stock...

Second, anyone know where i could get custom-length pushrods?

thanks,

clark
