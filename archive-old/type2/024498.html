I use the Permotex Aviation stuff.  I never can remember what it is exactly
called, but is comes in a short squatty jug with a brush made to the cap
(like PVC cement).  It says something about aviation on the container.

An older man who is a friend of mine and just so happened to work at a VW
dealer in the 60s and 70s as a mechanic suggested it when he helped me
rebuild my first AC engine.  On that motor, I had no leaks.  I used it on
my Westy engine as well to seal where the jugs meet the case.  I also used
the paper gaskets.

I think the whole sealant vs. no sealant, gaskets vs. no gaskets is like
asking Splitty or Baywindow.  It is a matter or personal preference.  I
have heard of people using every possible combination of sealant and
gaskets.  The aviation stuff works well IMHO and did not leak on my last
motor.

Your mileage may vary...
