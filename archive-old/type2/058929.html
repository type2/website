Subject: Taking first LD trip.

Hi everyone,

   Well I've decided to take the chance and take my bus out on the road.
By *Out* I mean cross country....Oregon to NC and back. This will be my
first *out of state* trip via the road so have some questions.

   My vehicle is a 75 9 passenger ...1800 with FI...new tires...just had
complete oil/lube and mechanic checked out. Milage is only 20,750
orginal miles (was stored 12 yrs).

   Any suggestions on any other pre-trip preps or items I should carry?
Anything from personal experience ..... I plan on 5 days going...5 day
stay with 5 day return trip. I've put approximately 6,000 miles driving
this vehicle and everything seems fine.

   As a side note I plan on taking a mid-route thru Idaho...Utah..WY...
Neb...Iowa...MO...Ill...Kentucky...TN and into NC. Same route back.

   Feel free to e-mail me direct ....and thanks in advance for the help.
Heading out 10/07/98.

Pete
