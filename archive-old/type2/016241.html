Subject: new gas tank time
Message-ID: &lt;35abc8d.243ff8a7_at_aol_dot_com&gt;

I swished some more gas through the tank and ever time it comes out it has 
some rust in it, i think i should buy a new tank.  Anybody know where I can 
order one?  I'm assuming most of them are &quot;refurbished&quot; tanks but thats 
probably the best I can get.  Thanks for any help.
