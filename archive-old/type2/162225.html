Subject: all, have fun _at_ eb, wish I were there

to all the travelers from the north of Pennsylvania area, if you get in a
bind on the way down to EB and need a place to work on the bus, or need
tools, a hand, or whatever.... I live about 40 mi north of Pittsburgh,
about 20-25 miles from the PA turnpike where it crosses rt 28..... Phone is
724-664-7463.  I am also listed on airs.  also, beware of some idiots been
throwing rocks at cars on the interstates around here... from bridges, from
the woods, from cars travelling in the opposite direction... see keep an
eye peeled.
travel safe!

Have a great time!


Mark
