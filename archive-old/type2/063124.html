Subject: opinions on '75 westys needed

hey now,

i just found a '75 westy for sale...second owner, older retired couple. they
said they've camped in it for years....and that it is in excellent shape
except that it needs a new starter. of course i haven't seen it yet. they
are selling their house and buying an rv. could someone give me a run down
on what should be standard with it. and isn't this the first year of fuel
injection? what should i expect with that? they are asking $1600 for it.
also said it has new tires. i'll be checking it out tommorrow.

thanks,

jonathan
