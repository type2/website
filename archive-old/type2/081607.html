Subject: Re: [T2] How to polish exterior trim?


&gt; I popped all the trim off my 69 Transporter the other day, figured to polish
it up as best as I
&gt; could (it's in decent condition).  I've been using regular FLAPS metal
polish on it applied with a
&gt; paper towel, plus the occasional rub with super fine steel wool, which does
help a little to remove
&gt; oxidation bumps and marks, but I can't see that this method will ever give
me the nice shine i'm
&gt; looking for...
&gt;  I want to be able to see myself...

Well.....you are in for a long hard job. That is, if you mean the 1&quot; wide trim
around the middle.
It is not polished aluminum. It is bright dip finish with a clear coat over
it.
1st you need to strip the clear coat off.
Then you need to rub off the bright dip.
Then you need to polish the bare aluminum.
Then you need to spray a clear coat on it to protect it.

What is bright dip, you ask?  This site tells about it:
