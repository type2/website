Subject: Columbus, Ohio??

Hello everyone.  I have recently relocated to Columbus, Ohio and I am
wondering if anyone out there might be familiar with the Volkswagen
community here.  I really need to find a good mechanic for routine
maintenance on my 76 Westy.  I am also looking for a good body shop that
is familiar with working on VWs.  I would also like to join any local VW
clubs or organizations.  Any information would be greatly appreciated.
Thanks,
Phillip
76 Westy
