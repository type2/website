Subject: Re: [T2] new cip1 1600 longblock

Quoted from Berg site:

&gt; The single OP case is to replace non-smog applications with the
&gt; regular factory fan and cooler and the dual OP is for replacement of
engines
&gt; with the dog house cooling systems.
&gt;
&gt; The dual OP case has larger galleries to flood more oil (larger pump) into
the
&gt; head to soak up the head temperature

What they are trying to say may be correct but, that is not how it comes
across.  Dual relief cases preceded the doghouse system by one year, which
in turn preceded the larger oil pump but almost another year.  Dual relief
was intended to keep a more consistent oil pressure on the main bearings.

&gt; The Volkswagen factory of Brazil has informed us that the AS21 case
&gt; containing 2% aluminium and 1% of silicon have....been replaced with the
new
&gt; AS41 case.....This gives the new AS41 case better
&gt; flexibility and durability.....and resists problems of the old AS41.

This information is wrong.  It is not Berg Ent's fault (information came in
after Gene died), just the messenger's.  The AS41 currently used is the
original version, now known as AS41A.
