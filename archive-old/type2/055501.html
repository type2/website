Subject: Re: Where do you work on your VW?

I work on the Westy, and my Geo Metro daily driver (and tune up the
hubby's Honda work beater) in the driveway. We live in a rural area,
and don't have to worry about prying neighbors. But a gravel driveway
can be a real bitch somtimes. Don't drop that piece of whatever on the
ground. It will disappear. Somtimes you're lucky, and if appears
quickly. Sometimes it's gone for oh, say one half an hour to an hour.
Then there's those parts that just dissapear. Gone. Usually those
little screws and nuts you don't have a replacement for. And it's long
after the hardware store has closed. Really pisses you off. We don't
have a garage or carport, so if it's not raining too hard the open
hatch on the Vanagon keeps the rain off if you stand right in the
middle. Thank goodness for the florescent trouble light with the long
cord. Oh yeah, don't drop anything on the ground after dark! Really
gone for good. When we drop the engine, that's a sight to see. Don't
have a floor jack, that's for people with a real floor, or pavement.
It drops onto a piece of plywood, and we haul it out with brute force,
a foot at a time. You just work with what you have. Oh I envy all you
people with a garage. Any garage. Unheated garage. Just to have a
closed, covered space to work in would be such a joy!
