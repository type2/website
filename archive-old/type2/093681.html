Subject: TR: [T2] what distributor to use?


well, the only choice in my advice is the Mallory with Vacuum Advance that
aircooled_dot_net sells.... the triggering is optical with the mallory system
call unilite, better than magnetic pickup as pertronix in my opinion.

look it here:

but be ready to pay some money for this mallory

Vacumm advance are not so bad with a Pertronix inside, actually thats my
config, ive throw away my 009... im using a dual vacuum (DVDA) distributor
(205 J) in my 1700 engine, and actually  because my 1700 is out ive put a
small type 1 engine (1600) temporary and again i did swap the distributor,
so my 205 J DVDA is on my type 1 engine and is really doin a good job(retard
unplugged)

And yes, you can choose 2 type of electronic ignition, one for the vacumm
advance and one for the mecanichal (as the 009)
