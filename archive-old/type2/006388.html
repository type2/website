  idleing problems]

[..]

There are 2 different &quot;bolts&quot; that retain the distributor in place on the
engine and in proper timing position.

The bolt [&quot;pinch bolt&quot;?] that retains the timing position is in a horizontal
orientation and holds the distributor clamp snug on the distributor.  If
this bolt is badly stripped the clamp may be loose enough to allow the
distributor to rotate a bit and lose proper ignition timing position and
affect idle.  This might also allow the distributor to raise up slightly and
allow some oil to leak out of the engine case around the base of the
distributor.

The other bolt has a more vertical orientation, and lives in front [front is
front] of the distributor.  This bolt goes through a lobe on the distributor
clamp and screws into the engine case.  If this bolt is loose, it's the case
threads that are stripped.  A very bad thing.  I'm not sure if that hole in
the case is blind, or if it goes clear through into the inside of the
engine.  If this is the bolt that's &quot;stripped&quot;, and the hole goes all the
way into the engine that would explain an oil leak at that location.

Either way, a distributor should never have the 1/4&quot; of wiggle/play you've
described.

Here's where you find out how good the mechanic's &quot;warranty&quot; really is.....

Check the points. Then check the timing (after you get a timing light).

&gt;  It looks like the Distributer where it bolts onto the case is leaking.

Leaking what? That doesn't sound good....

&gt;  There is a little play when you wiggle the whole distributer(about 1/4
inch)

Nor does that....
