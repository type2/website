Subject: Re: sand blasting/paint prep &amp; walnut media???

Hi ctonline_at_webtv_dot_net

On 12/06/03, you wrote:

&gt; From a bunch of practical experience, and being a bodyman / painter
&gt; the silica sand is way to go for a quick cleanup of old paint and
&gt; corrosion.

&gt; The ONLY way your going to warp any panels on these older Buses is
&gt; by simply bearing down on one specific area for an unreasonable
&gt; amount of time--and even then it would take an awful lot to do any
&gt; warping--

I'm working on an '80 Vanagon....so I'm thinking that qualifies as a
later model.

&gt; These vehicles aren't made of toilet paper thin metal as the late
&gt; model vehicles are--

&gt; I've tried the walnut shell media--and the plastic beads--

&gt; It's like blowing feather's at a brick--

&gt; If you have a bunch of time--and want to use twice as much product
&gt; to get the job done--this is the way to go--

&gt; And whatever product you choose to use, a Binks respirator is highly
&gt; suggested--

My concern is that in the past I've worked in ceramics...mixing clay
and glazes, firing kilns...I've got my share of silica already.

I've lived in houses with smoking parents, on and off, for decades.
My mom is now on oxygen for severe emphysema and now that I'm in my
40's I have to say my breathing isn't what it used to be.

The only mechanism your body has to remove dust from respiratory tract
is confounded by silica....its like tiny crystals with fish hooks that
it just can't move....once it gets in there it never comes out.

Organic material is less of a problem as long as your not exposed for
several hours a day for years until your body is overwhelmed.


Sincerely,
