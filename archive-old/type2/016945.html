&gt; &gt;Is your gauge plumbed with flexible tubing all the way to the front, or did
&gt; &gt;you use rigid tubing for that long run?
&gt; 
&gt; I moved my oneway valve up to the front by the booster, then put a Tee in
&gt; the line just behind the oneway valve and ran that up to the dash (only
&gt; about 6 ft of vacuum hose).  You could also just run vacuum hose from the
&gt; back to the front - I tried it through 100ft of 3/8 ID hose and it
&gt; registered just fine.
&gt; 
&gt; I agree with those who say it's a valuable gauge to have installed.  Tells
&gt; you a lot about your engine - maybe more than any other gauge.
&gt; 
&gt; I get about 15 at idle once it's warmed up, and 20 on decel.  The idle
&gt; vacuum depends a lot on your idle speed - mine is at 1400 rpm idle.
&gt; 
&gt; Another thing the vacuum gauge is great for is telling you when your engine
&gt; is warmed up.  When your engine is cold, clearances are greater and vacuum
&gt; is reduced.  As the motor warms up, the vacuum increases.  I start up my
&gt; bus and hold the idle at 2000rpm until the vacuum comes up to 15, then I
&gt; drive off gently.  This takes maybe 20-30 seconds.
&gt; 
&gt; The decel vacuum tells you a lot about your compression ratio.  When I
&gt; bumped my compression ratio from 6.7 to 7.0, my decel vacuum went up from
&gt; 18.5 to 20.  When I bump it again to 7.3 (in the next couple months,
&gt; whenever I get around to pulling the engine and tranny) I expect decel
&gt; vacuum to go to 21.5 or 22.  If I ever start to lose compression, I will
&gt; know immediately because my decel vacuum should drop noticeably.
&gt; 
&gt; -David
David:
I question whether compression ratio changes should have anything to do
with manifold vacuum. I have no question that that is what you observed,
I just wouldn't attribute it to the c/r increase. ALL other things being
equal, I'd attribute it to better cylinder sealing. However, intake
valve timing is most crucial and changing the valve lash as little as
.002-.003 would probably be measurable.
I agree that a vacuum guage is a valuable addition to help in monitoring 
engine performance. It's particularly useful to help teach a novice
air-cooled driver to keep from lugging the engine so as to retain better 
cooling under high loads.
Let us know how 7.3 turns out.
