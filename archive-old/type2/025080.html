Its been fun driving my 72 westy, not really though.  It HAS to be the fuel
pump, I took a look at the fuel filter, and the engine is almost sucking it
dry when its running, so when I start to get going faster, it simply runs out
of spare gas.  Basically my bus engine is running of gravity, there is just
enough gas trickling in because the tank is over the carbs, so I just put on
the flashers, pull over and let it idel a few mins, and there is enough in the
carbs to go a little further.  This is how I made it back home, and now I am
ordering a new electronic/mechanical (not sure which i should go for, feel
free to suggest) fuel pump, hopefully its the problem.

Tripps
