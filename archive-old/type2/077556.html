Subject: Re: Rear Hatch Hinge Covers

Someone has since offered to give me a pair. But since they do deteriorate a
source for new or repo one would be nice to have. I may make molds and
create a some fiberglass reproductions just to see how practical it would
be.


&gt;I may have some laying around from a '78.  They might be black.  Now if I
can 
&gt;only find them.
&gt;
&lt;&lt; Does anyone know where you can purchase new rear hatch hinge covers? The
only ones I ever see are pre 68. &gt;&gt;
