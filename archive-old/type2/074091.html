Subject: Re: [T2] Bolt of power for 78' 2.0 FI on Type 2


Scott,

There are other mods!!  Several sites show you how
to...errr...raise the pressure in your your
control pressure regulator without taking it apart.  I took my old dead
one apart to see if it would work....it would.  buyer beware!!!

if anyone is really interested you can buy a &quot;rising pressure
regulator&quot; from several sources...adjustable too.$$$$

Get this book....tips on increasing performance....etc

Bosch Fuel Injection and Engine Management 

Basicallly you are limited by the same things that limit a carb with a
fixed venturi size.....and the most importatnt.....there is a limit to how
much fuel you can get through a fuel injection valve.....even if it is 
open all the time...


Nice timing diagrams in the book.   No, it will not help troubleshoot very
well, but it does have a good description of the overall idea...


Cheers ,dave

&gt; it will be tough to get much of a useable HP increase without major engine

&gt; 
&gt; there's one simple thing you can do to the injection system: replace the
&gt; fuel pressure regulator with one that delivers a SLIGHTLY higher pressure,
&gt; therefore delivering more fuel for combustion. i believe a bosch regulator
&gt; from a datsun 240z is supposed to do this well. there are no other EASY FI
&gt; system mods that i know of. i will double check this in my emails and make
&gt; sure this is correct (about the datsun 240z)
&gt; 
&gt; a good extractor exhaust will help a bit, but may be difficult to find for a
&gt; 1978, i'm not sure. the 1978 exhaust is pretty convoluted, yes? this can be
&gt; replaced with something that flows more freely.
&gt; 
&gt; there are excellent aftermarket distributors at aircooled_dot_net which will
&gt; give some extra HP, but they do cost. for a street bus, look for the mallory
&gt; units with vac advance, and open up the wallet.
&gt; 
&gt; does &quot;bolt-on&quot; mean not taking the motor either apart or out of the vehicle?
&gt; 
&gt; there are significant gains in HP to be made by rebuilding the motor with a
&gt; larger displacement, and if you were contemplating a turbo, you'd need a
&gt; high level of confidence in the innards of your powerplant, not to mention
&gt; having to pull the motor to fit the turbo properly anyhow.
