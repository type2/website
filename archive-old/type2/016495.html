Subject: Free Stuff  Northern Virginia (Woodbridge)

Free - tow away - '78 bus, sans engine.

Good stuff (not much) - chrome front emblem, chrome front bumper (very,
VERY nice), chrome rear bumper (possibilities), hub caps (German - 2 of
4 are straight.  Obviously you have realized by now that I have a fetish
for German hubcaps, my Brazilian new hubcaps littering the highways of
Northern Virginia!!), front and passenger compartment floor mats.  And
the transmission.  Has some sort of a gauge in the clock section of the
instrument panel.

Not good stuff or gone stuff - Did not see any fuel pump, but the engine
compartment was slick clean, with the access panel to the gas tank taken
off.  Windshield not good. Rubber on two of three square vent windows
not good - one frame left side rusted.  Seats are not worth it.  No
spare, tires are dry rottened, and no two match.


Grandpa says this piece of junk has gotta go out of his front yard.  No
papers.  Will roll. Grandpa WILL NOT sell any parts.  Gotta tow away the
whole thing.  (Andrew Stephens - Mr. TOW BAR - are you listening)

The mailman (who gave me the tip) said it has been for sale for a few
months.  He has seen it for about 2-3 years there.  It did run at one
time!!  (perhaps even at 'two times')  [[Reminds me of a real joke on
me.  My co-worker announced to the office, in a loud voice, &quot;For those
of you who are interested, the Generl will be arriving in 15 minutes!&quot;
Where upon I reply &quot;And for those of us who personally don't give a
sh*t, when will he be coming!?!?!&quot;  Then came a loud, deep voice &quot;RIGHT
NOW!!!&quot;]]
  
Where in Woodbridge, you ask??  Well, I really do have a fetish for
German hubcaps!!  P-mail me for the POC, and we will talk!!
