Subject: A focused question regarding chargingbatteries

Jamie, David:

My experience is as a designer for an electrical engineering firm.

&gt;in this example, the starter normally draws a large &gt;amount of current, but the thin test light wire &gt;won't allow it to pass, and the lamp is part of that &gt;circuit.

The wire will do it's best to allow all that current to pass. The resistance of the wire (a constant in the equation related in ohms/ft) will generate heat as a by-product, melting the insulation of the wire and then possible arcing to other grounds.

&gt;If you connect a dead battery to a fully charged one 
&gt;using #12 wire, the wire will *not* burn up.

&gt;&gt;Under the right circumstances, I think it would be &gt;&gt;possible.  A dead battery has very low internal &gt;&gt;resistance.  If it's dead enough it will be
&gt;&gt;like a short to the charged battery.  Lots of &gt;&gt;current will flow.

Correct, current is determined by the load. Wire is sized based on expected loads, plus a safety factor.
It is NOT sized to limit current flow.

&gt;insulation is part of the factors determining the &gt;current capacity of wire.

Well, it's really the other way around. Isulation is chosen based on operating temperatures, duty cycles, location of the wire, etc. etc.

&gt;The impedance will choke any high current effectively

No, I think that's not true. As I said above, wire is sized (in the National Electrical Code, anyway) based on expected currents, plus a safety factor.

&gt;Actually,, most utilities DO not use breakers,,, or &gt;fuses... none! Well,, that isn't exactly true

Not it's not. There's a circuit breaker before a step-down transformer, before a switchboard, before a house service panel, and usually at sub-panels as well, and always on individual circuits.

&gt;that fuse does NOT provide any protection to the &gt;secondary single apt breaker panel.

Breakers are to protect wire, not equipment. A panel is nothing but a can full of breakers protecting more wire. Wire is the weak link in this chain, and electrical engineering is a lot about protecting and sizing your wire and wire protecting equipment.

&gt;even then, the #6 or #3 wires don't burn up with 400 &gt;amps fault current

According to the NEC table 310-16 allowable ampacities for #3 and 6 wire at 75 degrees C is 100 and 65 amps, respectively. You're armchair engineering saying that those wires won't burn at 4-6 times their load rating.

&gt;My point is, it is normal practice to ensure the &gt;wires are long enough to provide enough impedance to &gt;effectively choke and reduce the available
&gt;inrush current to a level that the protection can &gt;operate at.

I'm not familiar with this practice. I would assume that if you've seen cable coiled up in an enclosure, it's for future use/splicing/extention, whatever. That is a much more logical reason.
