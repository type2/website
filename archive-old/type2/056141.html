Subject: Re: 2 litre timing

&gt;Hi
&gt;        Having just acquired my first bus(76 camper) in 17 years
&gt;(previously had a 71 and 67 bus), and wanting to do all my own maintenance
&gt;as I used to, I've struck a bit of a problem finding correct info for the
&gt;timing. After consulting Muir, Bently, VW shops, and various www sites I've
&gt;come up with somewhere between 7.5BTDC and 5ATDC for my 2 litre MANUAL
&gt;trans motor(CJ). From what I can work out most of the 76 2 litre engines in
&gt;the US were auto trans(7.5 BTDC) but here in Australia there were also
&gt;manuals , which some info suggests should be 5ATDC.

Most of the 2 liter busses in the States are standard transaxle busses.
Not sure what the spec is for the timing but I run mine at 5 degrees BTDC.
I still run the stock (for 1973) dual Solex carbs.  Spec for the '73 1800
engine here in the US is, I believe, 7.5 ATDC but at that setting the motor
is losing precious horsepower.  I don't really care what the factory
setting is anyway - I want to time it for maximum horsepower.

In the very near future I'll be putting my bus on a chassis dynamometer.
For those unfamiliar with this device, it measures horsepower and torque at
the rear wheels from 2000rpm to redline.  Gives you a nice color graph of
each run so you can compare changes made between runs (such as timing
changes) to see what effect they had on power output.  The butt-O-meter is
notoriously unreliable for this but the dyno never lies.  It's the best
tuning tool there is.  They are mostly used to tweak racecars and
musclecars but I don't see why a bus can't benefit from it too.  This
particular dyno also has a wideband O2 sensor which will tell you precisely
how rich/lean you are running.  ah-verrrrah nice.

On my recent trip to Wisconsin I had a 10mph tailwind from Dallas to
Minneapolis/St.Paul (well, almost) and a 10mph headwind all the way back.
I was able to hold 65-70 on the way there but only about 60 on the way
back.  60 sucks on the interstates, especially for 1000 mile drives.  My
goal is to build a 2-liter that will push my two ton highroof bus to 70mph
headwind or no headwind.  To do that I need another 20hp.  I'm thinking K&amp;N
filters, Mark Stephens stage 1 heads, a bump in compression and a CD
ignition will get me there, but the dyno will tell me for sure.
