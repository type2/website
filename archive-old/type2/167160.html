Subject: Re: [T2] Bumper replacement

The bumper isn't going to look like a long brick
Sheesh you guys have no visualization for anything other
than your worst fears.

I have the original off already, weight wise it isn't going
to be much more. I have an existing bike rack that
hooked to it and it was ALREADY starting to buckle
the bumper. That's why strength of the new one
is needed.

&lt;&lt;&lt;Why would you think the new bumper is going to look ugly?&gt;&gt;

A new bumper would look good.
A C-Channel bumper is something out of a stone quarrey, or a dirt
excavating job, hanging off the front end of a class 8 18 wheeler.
Functional, but not pretty at all.

You don't need a rock quarry 100 ton truck bumper to have function.

&lt;&lt; Or I can use the existing one which isn't..&gt;&gt;

Again, attach a class 2 hitch under the stock bumper with a bike rack
slid into it.
Not bad looking, removable, and less work to get the same job done.

  &lt;&lt; add a reciever under the already not functional bumper.&gt;&gt;

Why do you think that the stock bumper is not functional?
It's been pretty functional for some time on all Type 2 Buses.
