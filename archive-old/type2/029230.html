&gt;On of my local lumberyards carries 1/8&quot; birch veneer plywood in 4 X 8 ft
&gt;sheets.  Look for a lumberyard that caters to cabinet makers - they should
have
&gt;it.  I have not checked, and my bus is at home, but if the ceiling panel
needs
&gt;to be more than 4 ft wide, a seam with a 1/8&quot; ply cleat behind it to
reinforce
&gt;it could be done.  Use thin A (cyanoacrylate) adhesive, available at any
hobby
&gt;shop that sells RC airplane stuff, for an instant and permanent bond.

It is more then 4' wide, that's the problem. The cleat on the back is a
good idea, but you would need to be careful where you put it as there is
not clearance for it in all parts of the seam, notably the leading and
trailing edge. I tried using the iron-on veneer tape, which split as it has
very little strength, and peeled off after a couple years
