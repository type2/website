&gt; &gt; I have decided that I need to get rid of my camper, a white 74, that has
&gt; &gt; been sitting in my yard for two years now. I am in Germantown,
&gt; &gt; Philadelphia, and the bus is yours (or anyones) for the asking. The engine
&gt; is broken
&gt; &gt; down in the garage, as I was tearing it down for a rebuild. The body is in
&gt; &gt; okay shape, but has a rusted out front axle. Let me know if you are
&gt; &gt; interested.
