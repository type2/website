Subject: Rubber Floor Mats

Hello VW people,
I drive a savannah beige 1970 type 2.  I'm trying to learn something about 
it's history.  It has brown rubber floor mats in it, with two-tone seat 
covers and two tone wall panels to match the covers.  Was this a special 
edition, I have found one like it at a junkyard a while back, but mine was 
in better condition.  I'm looking for replacement rubber, this is where it 
gets tough.  I don't know of any place that does brown rubber.  It was 
suggested to me to spraypaint the black rubber brown.
Any suggestions and ideas are helpful
Thanks
Rick
