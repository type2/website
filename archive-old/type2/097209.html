Subject: Re:older types: 2 the

Barry asked,
...&quot;OK,  so why do we keep these older types around any more:::
They creak and moan and are never able to go where they went before.
They leak and embarrass us wherever we take them.
The newer (younger) ones are faster and sleeker and don't look so bad.
They probably won't get to where they are supposed to get.  I.e., the
get up
and go has got up and gone
It costs too much to keep them going.
The fix-it and maintenance costs exceed the value.&quot;........

Now wait just a minute!  At 50 years old , most of those statements
apply to ME as well as our '71 bus.  I sure hope the wife isn't
planning on replacing me with one of those younger, faster, sleeker
ones that don't look so bad ...LOL...   :-)
Have a good day everybody and I hope to see a lot of you at John
Brown's Buses when I get there Saturday night.
