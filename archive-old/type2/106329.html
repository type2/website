Subject: Re: [T2] Everybus Pics

&gt; Heidi and I had a great time at Everybus. It was worth the 8-hour drive (each
&gt; way!). 

We are still waiting for the Kansas Buskatiers to make it home, need to put
warp drive in the old splitties to shorten that 1200 mile drive each way.

Thanks for posting the pics, looked like everyone had a good time.  The new
rules may have kept away those who can't abide by rules, but I'll bet that
made the campout much nicer for everyone else.
