Subject: Re: [T2] Porsche Engine Swap

Hi Volks,

I responded to Greg offlist that the 912 used a T4 engine, not the 356 
engine.  I had thought he had somehow  confused the 356 with the 914.

Apparently we are both right.... from 65-69 the 912 used the 356 motor, 
but in 1976 it was reintroduced as the 912E using a type4 engine. I 
seem to recall reading that Jake Raby owns two of them.

If the donor car is a 912E then the engine will be a LOT easier to get 
parts for.

Happy trails,
