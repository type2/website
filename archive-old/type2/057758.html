Subject: tech manuals for Solex and dizzies

Howdy from the North,

Can anyone tell me of a technical manual(s) available that deal(s)
specifically with Solex carbs and Bosch distributors.  I can't subdue the
curiosity to understand these more than I do, which is currently at the
shadetree/backyard mechanic level, and even that's debatable.  I am hoping
that a more detailed understanding of how the carb works with all its
ports, channels, galleries, jets.....and the workings of a distributor,
vacuum or otherwise, will assist me further in my diagnoses of problems
with Josie.

Thanks in advance.

Ron
