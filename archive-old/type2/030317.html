&gt; i'll be putting my engine back in tomorrow.  when i removed the intake

Melissa,

The gasket that sits between the intake air runners and the head on FI
engines (part # 022-129-707F) is a sandwich of a shiny graphite
impregnated ?paper? surrounding a hard black ?plastic? core.  You can
(and should) get replacements from any of the vendors on the list, or
Olympic, here in Northern Virginia, for &lt;$10.

&gt; do i need this muck?  what kind of liquid to rubber gasket is it...so i can 
&gt; buy some.

You dead flat need a gasket!  the correct gasket is a plus.  It sounds
like some P.O. had a &quot;better idea&quot; :-(

&gt; funny 
&gt; though, he said the spark plugs were the wrong type, so he put new ones in 
&gt; for me (without asking i might add.)  apparently, they weren't long 
&gt; enough.  i'm interested to see how it runs now.  i better hear some 
&gt; purrrrrrring!

Spark plugs:

W8CO is what the Vanagon Bentley says, W8CC is what I remember installing
last tune-up, same plug goes in any T4 Engine, '72-'83.
