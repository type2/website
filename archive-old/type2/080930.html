I have used car covers on various vehicles I've owned over the years, =
and quite frankly have been very disappointed with them. I've found a =
lot of dirt still gets under the cover and on the vehicle. They're a =
pain to put on by yourself (especially a Westy!) and even a bigger pain =
to deal with when they are wet. AND, if they get wet and the temps fall =
below freezing, well, forget about trying to get it off the car. I am =
toying with the idea of trying one of those portable shelters like in =
Harbor Freight and Northern Equipment catalogs. My dream is a detached =
two car garage/workshop. Someday....        Jeff
