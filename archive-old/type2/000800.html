I'm going to remove the heater this w/end but only have Saturday to do it on
a ramp &amp; I'm not sure of a couple of things.

1.

I have an up-right 1600 DP engine, do I still have an air blower? I don't
think there is one in this bus.

2.

Should I try &amp; remove the wiring loom for the heater with it, or is it part
of the whole loom?

3.

Any other things I should consider, like what to do about the &quot;T&quot; from the
fuel line. Fit a coupler?
