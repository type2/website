   I was thinking she meant shop manual, not the glovebox item, however,
I would not presume that VW would okay it or not. They recently sent
lawyers after *all* websites with VW in their name. And copying an
entire publication even for your own use is still illegal. You're
allowed to copy parts, not the whole. 
    How much of a hassle it could become is probably dependent upon
whether or not someone is currently publishing reproductions, or plans
to, and/or just how much of a PITA VW wants to be. A great many
publishers are becoming extremely vigilant on this issue -- we get all
sorts of notices on copyright issues all the time now. Can't recall if
it was this list or another that I mentioned this before, but some
publishers are now offering substantial rewards for info on copyright
infringement.
