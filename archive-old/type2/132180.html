&gt; I am having fitment problems with the heater accordion tubes from the
&gt; flapper boxes to the Y on the body (74 Westy). The aftermarket
&gt; replacements that I got from CIP are at least four inches too long, and
&gt; the diameter of the ends is much too narrow - they barely fit over the
&gt; flapper boxes WITHOUT the seal.

The tubes I bought some 7 years ago were also far too tight lengthways, so I
understand your predicament.  I did get them to go on but my arms were
aching by the end of it.  I had no problem with the diameter though, so I'm
not sure what's going on here.
