Subject: I'm here today via '77 Westy!!!

My '77 Westy is now licenced and brought me to work today after its 8 month
long head/ring/clutch replacement.  Damn it is good to have it back.  It seems
to run really good.  That is not saying much because I have nothing to compare
it to.  The last air cooled VW I rode in was when I was 10 or so.  I doesn't
sound as bad as it did before though.
I could use some help with some problems I have encountered.
1.  The throttle will usually not close by itself.  (It is a '77 Westy 2L with
FI)  It closes most of the way but I have to reach down and pull it up to
really get it where it belongs.  It maybe due to the way I connected the
throttle cable the to FI system.  I stuck the cable through the fastener, 
pulled it snug with vice grips, and tightened it.  Is this the correct method.
Maybe it is something else?  
Also, I am not sure if the thermostat is working.  What should the thermostat
(acordian thing) look like cold and warm?  I tried to tell if the little arm
moved but couldn't really tell.  I drove 40 miles last night (65 degrees 
outside) and it seemed fine.  The dipstick was just slightly warm.  I guess
it must be working then but I need something to worry about.
Please help,
And thank you everyone for your help over the last 8 months!!
Brett
