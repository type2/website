Subject: Re: [T2] Vacuum saga continues

Jason,

I've been thru the same thing with my new engine as well.

I am getting a little better than 12&quot;, but not a whole lot.

I have tried the spray starter fluid trick, removed almost *every*
line from the vacuum locations and plugged them and still can't get
much better vacuum.

I don't get it either, but the engine seems to run better everytime
I start it.  It's not running hot, it's idling  well, it starts
fine in 20 degree weather.

So, I'm with you,....whasup with this??

Any automotive engineers out there that can *really* explain this?

Cheers, dave

&gt; What is it with me and vacuum leaks?

&gt; 
&gt; Didn't make any difference in the vacuum reading (still at 12''), but 
&gt; after thinking about it, I wouldn't expect it to.  It did change the 
&gt; feel of the brake pedal, though.  I'm not sure if for the better or not 
&gt; -- it almost feels like it does when the engine isn't running.  Would 
&gt; this be indicative of a bad booster?  I didn't take it out for a drive, 
&gt; because I don't want to lose my parking spot while I still have to work 
&gt; on it.
&gt; 
&gt; So, I guess I need to go on a serious vacuum leak hunt.  I checked all 
&gt; the connections in the engine compartment... they look fine.  My check 
&gt; sequence will be:
&gt; (The carb cleaner trick does work with FI engines, right?)
&gt; 
&gt; Should I also check the decel valve?  Do I recall correctly that 
&gt; there's a Bentley procedure for this?
