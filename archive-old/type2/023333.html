How do you know it's hot? If it is by gauge forget it. Is the dipstick 
getting hot - too hot to hold in your hand?

I think though basic this is a better gauge of temp here.

Wondering it the factory screwed up here on assembly and maybe installed 
the cam incorrectly.

I'd say if you have a  warranty, start using it.

Keep us updated!
