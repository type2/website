&lt;&lt; I have a friend who runs a restaurant and has successfully for over 30

years. He gets there at 5 a.m., closes at 2:30 and leaves at 7 p.m. He

doesn't charge his customers for those extra hours. He doesn't charge his

customers for using credit cards. He accepts the fact that when he got into

the restaurant business he would be working hard.


What's next? A charge for taking our money to the bank.


Give me a break.

Next time you're in the restaurant don't tip the service folk and explain
that it wasn't included in the price so why should you pay it?
And as for Wal-Mart...Yes, they charge for everything included in getting
a product out the door...They're very precise about this and as a result
Wal-Mart carries nothing that doesn't &quot;move&quot; and buys its product on the
basis of &quot;price&quot;...(Wal-mart must support hundreds of Chinese factories...
Go thru' the store and see how many &quot;made in America&quot; stickers you can 
find? ); then see how many local stores that may have carried something
special that you're interested in are left... ?-(
