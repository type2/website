Subject: used a file as a lever

Hello,

you say you used a file as a lever to unscrew the oil pressure relief screw
in a VW case?!!!

&gt;I used a file as a &quot;lever&quot; to help turn it. I managed to find one
&gt;that was the same thickness as the slot and put it in w/ the slot and
&gt;pulled.
&gt;

you choose a tool for the metal strengths is has

flexible vs. stiff
soft vs. hard

files are really brittle, and hard, they were sharpened to be able to cut
other metals, but to keep the sharp edge, the file has to be very hard in a
tradeoff of metal strengths. to get the hardness strength files get brittle
like glass,

I am surprised you could put much force on a file without breaking it.

on the other hand, a high quality screwdriver is the ideal combination of
metal strengths for its restricted uses

it is hard enough to be stiff, but not so hard to be brittle, so that you
can put so much force on a screwdriver that it will flex a little, but
straighten back out by itself

a piece of spring steel like in your leaf springs, or even your torsion
springs, have a little different combination of metal strengths,

springs are not hard enough to cut other steels. if you sharpen spring steel
and try to use it as a file, it will soon wear out and get dull, if you try
to apply any force to a spring,  it will flex.

a spring is not stiff like you want a lever to be, however a spring will
bend against a force and straighten itself out over and over and over.

so you see, you select a steel tool for the metal strength qualities that
have been instilled in it.

a file is not a good lever, it will snap off suddenly and you may get hurt.

if you sharpen a file , the sharp edge will last a very long time and not
wear out by bending over or wearing away

if you have a sword made of a file, your sword will break the first time it
hits something

if you sharpen a spring, the sharp edge will last a long time, but not as
long as the file edge,

if your sword is made of a spring, your sword will flex back and forth when
it hits something

I was helping my brother and his girlfriend work on his bus. when I wasn't
looking, his girlfriend got my newest, sharpest, favorite file and she used
it to pry something, and she broke it in half. She said my file broke
because it was a cheap worthless useless tool. I couldn't make her
understand that you choose and use a tool for its intended purpose according
to the strengths instilled in the metal the tool was made of.
