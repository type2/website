Subject: [T2] 76 Westy stalling at idle

'76 Westy 2.0 F.I.
My bus will not idle properly after it warms up, the revs slowly drop until
it stalls. It will then restart no problem., but will not idle. The
temperatures are pretty cold here these days - could it be condensation or
frozen gas line?  Anyway it only seems to happen after its been running for
a while. Any suggestions are appreciated.

Thanks, Brad
