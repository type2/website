Subject: Re: [T2] Stubborn Flywheel

Brian,

Generally accepted method is two large screwdrivers between the flywheel 
and the case 180 degrees across from each other....gently, gently.

Wiggle them a little and make sure nothing breakable is under the 
flywheel!

Cheers, dave

&gt; K, got the flywheel gland off my old bus motor, but can't seem to budge the
&gt; flywheel off of the dowels.
&gt;
&gt; Anyone have cool tricks for pulling off the flywheel?
