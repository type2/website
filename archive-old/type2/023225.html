My local powder coater requires the rims to be ready for powder coating on 
arrival - they won't prep for you here. They suggested a local monument 
company - that is a cemetery headstone company who uses sandblasting to cut 
the letters into the marble. They sandblasted everything cheap - I think 
there was a small charge per wheel. I also made sure that I told them to 
take their time and not rush the job - just fit them into the schedule when 
they could. I think this helped keep it cheap.

The powder coater charges $40 per hour. She said they could do about 15-16 
wheels per hours - same $40. Take this into consideration is you have other 
parts that can be done in the same color. New color = new hour = another 
$40. I powder coated two sets of wheels, some trailer fenders, and a couple 
of misc. things at one time. Did the same with my black items - trailer 
parts, propane tank, gas tank for my Beetle.

Check the yellow pages. Might call a marine repair shop or some of the 
motorcycle shops. Both probably use powder coater shops the most.

On your wheels there will be an irregular surface created between the rim 
and the center portion of the wheel where the powder coating doesn't fill 
evenly. One Type 2 lister suggested using caulking of the appropriate color 
to fill this and it has the added benefit of sealing moisture out and any 
rust in. My trailer wheels have been sitting out for a few months now and 
show a little bit of rust stain (easily cleaned) from this seam due to the 
rain, etc.

Take care.
