Subject: Re: Mexican Rear Slider Windows
Message-ID: &lt;374EFA66.4F56_at_HiWAAY_dot_net&gt;

I was in Mexico, Belize, and Guatemala recently with my 72 Westy. In
Mexico I bought the still available CHROMED sliding windows.
It is a set of three, as on the left rear there is also a sliding
window.
There is no sliding window for behind the sliding door available for
safety reasons (stick your head out and someone opens the sliding door).
It is a mystery why no-one has started to import these windows. They
have all the DOT stamps and are available with different tints and in
green. I'm sure they would sell well.

&gt; Hello Lists-
&gt;    I was perusing that page of Mexibus brochures and noticed the top of the
&gt; line caravelle model has the late bay and Vanagon sliding windows... also
&gt; looks like it has rear sliders in the space behind the cargo doors.  I saw
&gt; these once in S. African photo and wonder if they are available from VW of
&gt; Mexico?  Any links or ideas?
