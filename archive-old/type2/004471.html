Hmmn assuming of course he must have replaced the pushrods as well as
required (you would have to), I would not sweat it.  Seems off hand this
engine is probably high on miles (over 100k?) if he replaced the hydraulics
for I guess being noisy or failing.  So all in all putting $100 in lifters
in her when she only has maybe 25-50k left is sort of foolish.  Plus at
higher mileage if you are doing as you say and keeping an eye and adjustment
on things I think solids do you a better service of alerting to imminent
valve seat recession or stretching valves, either a possible failure
scenairio.

Don't worry it, change the oil every 3000, and check the adjustment at the
same time.  The hydraulic cam is conservative compared to the solid so there
is no danger of damage to anything.
