Greetings -

&gt;
&gt; 185 x .78 = 144.3
&gt; 195 x .75 = 146.25
&gt;

I heard that the old 185/14's had a .82 aspect ratio. That may have been the
bias-plys though, which I think were also around at the time, which would
put:

185 x .82 = 151.7 (+ 151.7 + 355.6 (rims)) = 659mm diameter.

659 / 648.1 (195/75*14) = 1.68% shorter gearing with the 195/75 than
185/82(?) originals.

1.68 * 60mph = 1 mph less speed at 60mph worth of RPM.

BTW - 205/75's fit, and will result in 633.1 worth of diameter.
