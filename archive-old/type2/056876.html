A few years back I remember seeing that Bernie Bergman had developed a hydraulic lifter kit for a type I/II engine.  You had to send in part of your engine to be machined, or you could buy a turn key from him.  What ever became of these?  Can you still buy a hydraulic lifter kit for these engines?

Thanks,

Bryan
