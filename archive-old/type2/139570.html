Subject: Re: [T2] URGENT: drying the air-oil filter

It's not going to hurt anything to move your bus the 30 feet or so without 
and air filter.

Move it, let her get out and then finish drying the air cleaner.

Tank, if it is not too wet, it won't hurt to drive it like that...it will 
dry out quickly with all the air that will be passing thru it.

Probably make the engine run better for a few minutes too...&lt;grin&gt;.

Let it idle for a few minutes after you hook it back up, so it doesn't try 
and suck *all* of the moisture out at once...


Cheers, dave

&gt; in the sun to dry ... and last night it rained. The problem is that my

&gt; camper is currently in the driveway, with an unattached, damp air-oil
&gt; filter -- blocking her in the garage.
&gt; 
&gt; I have the filter hooked up to a hair dryer as I speak (which, btw, smells
&gt; real nasty). How long is this going to take? What are the risks of not
&gt; drying it thoroughly and hooking it up long enough to move it from my
&gt; driveway to the curb across the street? I need to get my butt to work
&gt; shortly, so I am a bit panicked.
&gt; 
&gt; Many Thanks!
