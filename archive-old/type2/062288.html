Some people were trying to get 1/8&quot; plywood, and I don't know if they had any
luck or not, but evidently, it's hard to get.  I'm sure having the woody roof
helps on those long cold winter drives though.

My camper &quot;We Made It!&quot; ('69) has the following camping setup:

Stove   -       A kerosene Coleman 2-burner
Fridge  -       A 1960's model Coleman ice chest
Sink    -       A 5 gallon pickle bucket and a water bottle
Potty   -       A hand shovel, a squeeze bottle of bleach water, and a roll of paper.
Bed     -       A 1960's model Coleman sleeping bag

I find this setup a LOT more convenient, practical and economical than most
campers I've seen.

Regards,

James
