Subject: Failed Emissions HC ppm 2000+ Suggestions?

Hello list.  I've just come back from the inspection station with a
rejection slip that says my hydrocarbons  (HC) are 3,000 ppm at idle
and 2,000 ppm at 2,500 rpm, when the legal limit here in Northern
Virginia is 400 ppm. 

I've been trying to get my '76 deluxe on the road since I bought it
from Pat Flynn in May, so this is a big drag.  

The archives don't tell me much, except Hoover's post which notes that
as valve guides wear, HC levels go up. The mechanic at the inspection
station said that HC levels this high can only be due to massive
engine wear and that I would detect it through a compression check. 
Of course I thought he didn't know what he was talking about because I
just replaced the heads and had  compression of 105 to 115 on three
cylinders and zero on the other before the head job.  Now I'm thinking
maybe he could be right, but I'm not sure.  I did another compression
check tonight and I've got 110 on 3 , 110 on 4, 122 on 1 and 120 on 2.
 The drivers side head is a rebuild from APV.  The pass. side head is
a used that I got off the list after the aluminum around a cylinder
head broke completely off on the old head while my mechanic was
putting in a helicoil (another long story).  

If such high HC levels can only be due to engine wear, could it be
that the valve guides in the used head are worn enough to be causing
the problem?  Alternatively, could my rings be worn enough to cause
the problem?  Finally, is it ever possible that HC levels are due to
problems which can be fixed by tuning?

Needless to say this is a big drag as I've already pulled the motor
twice since May and may be no closer to being street legal after all
of the time and $$$.

Any advice?
