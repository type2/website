Subject: Re: [T2] timing settings? VW emblem?

&gt; My 1976 2 Ltr. bus needs urgent attention. Still waiting for my Bentley

&gt; Could someone please post the timing settings (as on pulley) for this motor?

Do you still have the sticker on the engine lid?  Here are the specs:

http://www.oldvolkshome_dot_com/ignition.htm#B7679

Early 76 settings just before in that same list.

GD Engine:

&gt; Dwell 44-50 degrees (new points), 42-58 (worn points)
&gt; Points gap 0.40-0.50mm (0.016-0.020)

All that info is nice but list advice says to set the gap so the dwell reads
50 degrees.

Spark plugs: use Bosch W8CC and set gap to 0.7mm

Valves: 0.006 in. on both intake and exhaust on stock 76 2L with solid
lifters.

&gt; Also, where can I buy on-line a plastic reproduction of the front &quot;VW&quot; emblem?

A genuine VW one is $35 and of course there is the junkyard if you are
lucky? Why do you want a plastic one?
