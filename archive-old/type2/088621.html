Subject: Re: [T2] Re: tightening rims/ wheels coming off

&gt;&gt;...After using an
impact wrench to put the nuts back on an aluminum
wheel, I torqued it...&lt;&lt;

i always put the lug nuts back on by hand. i've witnessed some hotshot who
thought he knew what he was doing &amp; stripped the threads out.

YMMV,
