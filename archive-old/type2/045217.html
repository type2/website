Well, first of all, this wasn't 50-67 bus content, much less bus content
from any generation.  Or things.  Or vintage of any nature.  Even on a
Friday this post would have been &quot;out there.&quot;

I was away from the list to primp my buses, then got up at o-dark thirty to
go the the show.  I can't monitor the list all day long.

Your best bet would be to send your beef to VW directly. Go to VW_dot_com  

Or try the rec.autos.makers.vw.watercooled, or one the A-chassis mailing
lists.
