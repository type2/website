Hello Everyone,


   I hope you all had a good 4th of July holiday. I am looking for the 
following part and have been unsucsessful at finding it from my usual 
channels. The part number is 211 905 887. It is the grey cylinder that the 
Ignition lock cylinder and ignition switch go into on a 71 type 2 
campmobile. I hope someone can help me out.

   Also I saw someon driving a bad ass bug around my area. I am hoping this 
guy is on the list. If anyone is on this list from Delaware let me know. I 
would like to meet up share tips etc...

Cheers,

Joe
71 Campmobile
