Subject: RE: [T2] ADMIN: Please Kill this thread (Re: [T2] FW: Jiffy
  Lubes caught  on NBC camera)

Admin, please kill the &quot;please kill this thread&quot; threads.  This member has
failed to find his &quot;Don't Open This Email&quot; key twice this very month!
Further, these two posts contain zero Bus content.

;-)


My Bus content about, &quot;Being Ripped Off by Fraudulent Companies&quot;:

I hired &quot;Schuylkill Sandblasting and Painting&quot; to sandblast and paint my
Westy with POR 15. After sitting on it for four months,  they charged me
$250 and did not sandblast, did not clean, did not mask but did spray POR15
all over the bottom of my poor Bus, covering wires, fuel pump, fuel filter,
peeling undercoating, gorgeous Koni Adjustable Shocks, inside wheels, tires,
aftermarket sway bars, gas lines, grease, and unrepaired rust holes.

Should I sue these turkeys?  Or should I just be thankful I only lost $250
and the price of a pint of POR15 (and a winter season wasted waiting for
them).

Please kill this thread.  Six posts is enough for a subject with no bus
content.

Thanks,

&gt; This is a series of investigations into Jiffy Lube done by KNBC Ch4 here
in
&gt; the Los Angeles area several weeks ago.  Here's a link to their site with
