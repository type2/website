Subject: [T2] Torque For Exhaust Manifolds
Content-Disposition: inline

&gt;Don't have any manuals handy, but i remember a piece in the Muir book the
defines a way of &gt;judging tourque by watching how the tendons in your (Muir's)
forearm react at a certain &gt;level.  Sort of like the Justin-Wilson
exact-teaspoon-of-salt-in-the-palm-of-his-hand &gt;thing.
&gt;I'd bet it couldn't be more than 10-15 ft-lbs.

You're referring to 'Stick's' method for determining torque - for low torque
applications such as the 6 acorn nuts on oil drain plate of the upright motors,
or the center 13mm on the oil drain plate of the late motors. You turn until the
tendon in your wrist pops out.
You have to be careful not to overtighten because you could strip the nuts,
and/or 'damage
the cam' in the case of the later motors. Undertightening of course would lead
to loss of
oil and main bearing failure - so be sure you get it right.

Exhaust manifold nuts should be tighter than that though- I would say about 14
foot pounds.
