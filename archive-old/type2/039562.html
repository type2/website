Not trying to be a party pooper here, but I do remember hearing one 
negative to go along with all the positives - that the kit reduces ground 
clearance and offroad ability because of decreased suspension 
travel.  Since I do a lot of driving in my bus on rutted, rocky dirt roads 
in remote places, I decided against the kit for this reason.  For those 
that never venture off of paved streets though, this shouldn't be a concern.
