Subject: Re: [T2] Happy Thanksgiving + Marginal VW Content

&gt;As a Canadian, I was wondering how big a holiday this is in 
&gt;the US? Will VW parts places be closed? &lt;--- VW Content

I am also Canadian, married to an American, and we spend every Thanksgiving
here in the US because its a HUGE holiday, as big as Christmas for some. I
enjoy Black Friday the most. Everything is closed today, even the BusDepot
(going there tomorrow though) !! &lt;--VW Content
