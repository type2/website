Subject: Re: [T2] How long can a westy run?

hello all   i have been driving my 65 westy since 1971 .   I have been in 44 
states and 6 canadian provs.     seen every state on the east coast at least 
3 times each from key west to prince edward island    .  Take care of them 
and they will run forever .   mark  salem import service    salem va.
