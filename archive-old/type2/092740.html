Subject: VDO Instruments aftermarket and OEM

Just a quick project update.

2 days ago I disassembled my instrument cluster. I took EVERYTHING off of 
it. Then I re-dyed the plastic to match the grey/black interior scheme that 
I am using in my '78 Westy. The instrument cluster panel got washed with 
some mineral spirits to remove all the dirt, grime, dust, and Armor-All of 
the past. It even appeared to bleach the brown color a little bit though I 
did not see any evidence on my rag. I noticed that they all come in black 
and are dyed brown at the factory. I tapped off the backs of the instrument 
openings so the white paint that the factory applied would not be covered 
with my grey dye - I didn't want to repaint the white as it was in good 
condition.

Then came several light coats of the grey that I am using. It is the same 
dye used to re-color vinyl and such - basically a flexible paint. I sourced 
this stuff at local auto body shop supplier and compared to the black I 
bought at the local auto supermarket parts place - - - - MUCH better 
quality for slightly more $$$. The coverage is better and it seems a bit 
tougher. But I knew this from dying the dash and other little items earlier 
in the spring.

Last night I pulled apart my brand new VDO &quot;Cockpit&quot; style tach and the oil 
temp, oil pressure, and cylinder head temp gauges that I am reusing from an 
earlier life that I had with this bus (pre-resto). I used a tiny flathead 
screwdriver to slowly unbend the rear of the metal surround on the gauges 
that held the glass front on the gauge and removed the glass. Note this 
will probably void any warranty if your instruments are new...

I took some white spray can paint and sprayed it into the cap of the spray 
can for a cup. I would recommend using bottled paint or waiting for alot of 
the solvent to evaporate b/c the paint was too thin to cover the needles 
well at the beginning. I ate dinner and when I finished and made attempt#2 
it covered very well. Especially if there was enough paint on the brush for 
the paint to flow onto the needle without much brushing (which at first 
kept exposing the orange paint below).

I then used a tiny artist's brush (.69 cents) to make the VDO &quot;Cockpit&quot; 
gauges' orange needles white to match the white OEM VW speedo and gas 
gauge. It would be easier to paint the OEM stuff orange (two already open 
OEM needles versus 4 aftermarket needles that required surgery to access) 
but I'm not a fan of orange gauge needles. The tach also has an adjustable 
pointer for the driver to set and indicate the max RPM. It was red. I also 
wanted this to be white but I could not find a way to remove it - - - the 
side that was red and that I wanted to paint was against the inside of the 
glass face (2-3 mm of space between the needle and the glass). I wish I 
could have done away with it altogether but I couldn't.

What I did was carefully paint the needle without worrying about the paint 
on the glass. When it dried I removed the paint from the glass with a 
razorblade. Easy. I was very careful not to get fingerprints on the inside 
of the glass or on the instrument faces. They could be cleaned but I didn't 
want to reassemble them and then notice any junk inside.

To seal the instruments again I assembled them and then placed them face 
down on my work surface. While I applied pressure on the backs of the 
instruments to compress the gasket between the instrument glass and the 
instrument housing I used a medium to large flat blade screwdriver and I 
simply bent the edge of the ring down again. It isn't as perfect as the 
factory by any means but I have no worries it will come apart.

A friend from Chattanooga is bringing me a VDO mounting ring from Bus-Boys 
this weekend hopefully so I can mount the tach permanently. I held the tach 
up and into place once I got it together and it looks so GOOD! Looks like 
it was supposed to be there from the beginning. The only difference is the 
font used on the tach is slightly different from the speedo. You could 
replace your speedo with a new VDO Cockpit or print a new face for the tach.
