&gt; Anyway, to the purpose of this posting-why are the bay busses so lowly 
&gt;regarded by the rest of the VW enthusiasts?   Any ideas? 

I thought we air cooled Vanagon people were at the bottom?

&gt;&gt;&gt; Owners of Õ49 MGTCs look their nose down at 
&gt;owners of Õ53 TDs who look their noses down at owners of Õ57
MGAs--SNIP--

I like the TF's, but then again I like air cooled Vanagons (and Things)!
