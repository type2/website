Subject: Re: [T2] Need help with transmission

&gt;  #2 here is the input shaft:
&gt;  http://www.ratwell_dot_com/technical/Microfiche/t203000.gif
&gt; the bearing is # 7.  VW part number:
&gt; mid 69 to the end of 71 is 001 311 125
&gt; 72 up is 001 311 125A.

Im wondering what sort of job this is. I have a spare trans with a very
noisy bearing and my current one pops out of 2nd a little so im
interested.
