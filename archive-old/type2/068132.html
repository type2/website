&gt; without smogs. The law says the seller must provide, but DMV doesn't care

I'd take another look at the vehicle code in California, especially as it
relates to the smog emission, registration, &quot;lemon law&quot;. As I understand
it (and I will double check), the owner (seller) of a vehicle cannot sell
a vehicle of which he/she has knowledge of a modified or non-working
exhaust system, or whose smog test was obtained by illegal (immoral and
unethical, I might add) means. For a vehicle sold in California, my
understanding is the seller may be held responsible for any post-sale
repair costs that the buyer incurs to get the vehicle smogged. My
impression is that this law is to discourage persons from selling cars in
California that for the most part are not smogable ... especially if the
seller has this knowledge and does not inform the buyer. If the seller
fails to ascertain smogability, he is just as guilty as if he knew
before hand the vehicle wasn't smogable. 

Bottom line; although you may sell a car to a buyer in California, if the
buyer cannot get the vehicle smogged and he is aware of the legal issues
involved, he could take the seller to court to recover ANY and ALL
expenses involved in getting the vehicle smogged (regardless of what that
amount is! ouch!). 

So if you sell a car in California, the &quot;As Is&quot; clause you include in the
sales agreement, may have no validity as it regards smogability of a
vehicle. 

My perspective comes from going through the system (proper channels) with
an out-of-state vehicle I wanted to sell here in California. Initially, I
did not want to fork up the parts costs and $300 cal import fee, so I
sought to sell the vehicle &quot;As Is&quot;. Apparently, it's a no go. I could sell
the car, but if the buyer couldn't get it smogged I could be held liable
for all the buyers costs getting the vehicle smogged.

Personally, I think the law is a bit much in some regards, but then again
it protects unwary buyers from unscrupulous sellers. 

My $00000.02.
