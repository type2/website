Subject: Re: '79 Engine in an '81

&gt;   Not a joke at all -- look at any sandrail or dunebuggy. Super hopped
&gt;up (which naturally means hotter running) engines and they definitely
&gt;don't have sealed engine compartments.

And they also don't have any sort of engine enclosure like real VWs do.  
Not a valid comparison.  I suspect the lack of any type of engine 
enclosure is what allows this to work as the heat can readily escape 
into the surrounding air.  Not like a Bus at all.  Conjecture on my part 
of course, but then I don't know how long those dune buggy engines last.  
I suspect not too long if they are really chromed out.

 Also look at VW powered aircraft
&gt;-- no cooling tin at all, or even fans.

Well if you have the engine at the front of your Bus with plenty of 
ventilation and a large propeller forcing air over it AND you run in 
pretty cool air temperatures 90% of the time and you regularly drive 
over 150 mph then I guess this is a valid comparison :-)

 I also ran a VW powered sawmill
&gt;for many years -- only minimal cooling tin.
&gt;And that, BTW, was like having your car sitting in one spot all day
&gt;long, no airstream from forward movement like you do in a vehicle.
&gt;
I suspect that the VW sawmill used a Type 1 industrial engine, not a 
Type 4 engine (the engine in question in the '79-'81 swap).  The Type 1 
does have the cooling fan in a location more conducive to this type of 
operation.  The Type 4 has the cooling fan located directly above the 
exhaust.  Not as good for stationary engines.  And the fact that there 
is no air flow invalidates this comparison also as air flow becomes a 
significant factor in why you need all the cooling tin!
