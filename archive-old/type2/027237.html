Subject: Re: [T2] Seat Belts

&gt;From: &quot;Courtney Hook&quot; &lt;chook_at_nisa_dot_net&gt;

&gt;Ted, I'm interested in doing this, did you have to change the other part of
&gt;the seatbelt (the piece it clicks into?) between the seats ?


Courtney,

Yes, I just used the pieces from the Vanagon belts.  They came as a set from 
the wrecking yard.  They are about the same length as the Bus ones.  Just 
removed the Bus ones and installed the Vanagon ones.  They fit perfectly!

Ted
