Subject: Re: [T2] which is better?

They will be virtually the same for highway driving (4th gear).  Around 
town (gears 1-3), the 5-rib tranny is significantly taller;   That is, 
you will go about 10% faster in every gear except 4th with the 5-rib.

I'd recommend the 5-rib unless you need a stump-pulling 1st gear.

&gt; highway driving? or do they have the same gearing?
