Willem and list:

I had exactly the same problem on my '70 with a VDO tach. There is a very
cheap fix for this that involves splicing a little tiny resistor, available
at Radio Shack for .70, in the line that runs from the coil. I am sorry I
don't have the exact part number for this, but you can find it in the
library or archives. Works like a charm.

&gt; Dear Type2 friends,
&gt;
&gt; Maybe some experienced people could help me out here!
&gt; I put in a VDO tachometer and it works.
&gt; I got a 74 2L carb.
&gt; The only thing which needs some attention is that the rmp vary a lot when
&gt; driving at a constant speed. If I drive around 60mph the tachometer shows
&gt; around 4000rpm in 4th gear! Is this correct and schould it be like this,
or
&gt; is this too high?
&gt; And at this constant speed the variation can be from 3800rmp till
4200rmp..
&gt; I think that's a big variation!
&gt; How does this occur and what can I do to make it more stable?
&gt; Thanks to all of u!
&gt;
