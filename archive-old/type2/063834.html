&gt; While attempting to rewire my dashboard/fuse box, I ran into a small, metal
&gt; box mounted upside down on the metal piece that supports the steering
&gt; column.  It is rectangular, and has the lettering, &quot;150-10 12V&quot; stamped on
&gt; the side of it.
&gt; 
&gt; There are several wires coming off of this box that go to various places,
&gt; none of which I can find listed in either the Haynes or Bentley manuals.
&gt; One large red wire runs to the back of the bus somewhere - another goes to
&gt; the headlight switch, and another is spliced into an always-hot wire from
&gt; the fuse box.

My powers of intuition tell me that it's an after-market relay formerly
used to power an A/C blower or something similar.  My former '79 Bust
had one of these and it drove me crazy because I assumed (U&lt;--ass--&gt;me)
that it was part of the starting circuit.  The &quot;150-10&quot; part is sort of
confusing, though.  If something on your bus decides it needs 150A you
may want to jump out before it explodes!  I would try disconnecting it
and see what quits working.  If nothing quits working, ignore the relay.

You say it has a wire going to the headlight switch?  Do you have some
mega-watt driving lights on the bus?  Aircraft strobes on the roof?  A
really K/A stereo that you only run at night?  A welder?  I wonder...
