&gt; I just had my 79 federal 2.0L bus smogged (Reno NV)

I'm in Baltimore Maryland

&gt; and the best I could get my HC down to was 3.04 which
&gt; passed, however, the emission sticker on the enging
&gt; lid says that it should be in the range of .5 to 1.0

that sounds like a CO number at least around here HC is measured in PPM
(parts per million)  the standard locally for this vehicle is 430ppm,
while my 78 had 1518ppm....my CO level was quite low at 0.84 (standard is
5.50)

&gt; I just put in new pistons and cylinders and had the
&gt; heads down. The engine runs great, but, don't know why
&gt; the reading is so high.

except for starting my van runs pretty good too, I rebuilt the engine
about 25k ago and have had no problems after I got the bugs worked out,
and replace bad heads

&gt; If you get any insight on your engine, please pass the
&gt; info along to me and I will do the same as I look into
&gt; my 'problem' this weekend.

couple other folks said it sounded like I was lean, however I think my gas
mileage is down a little, (about 15 in the city, maybe 17-18 on the
road) which would indicate rich rather than lean.

it's bitter cold for around here and I don't have a garage so any work on
it is going to wait a few weeks, I got an automatic 120 day extension to
get the work done so I have some time.

I plan on going through the basics, 
. check plug color,
. compression
. timing
. valves are hdy and has Pertronix points

am considering buying a exhaust anyalizer but the decent ones are $$$$

have to spend $450 on tune up stuff to get a waiver for 2 years, at which
point I will be over 25 years old and exempt (I think)

an older guy at the test station said that these old air cooled VW's need
to be nice and warmed up before they will test well, when I bring it back
I should take it out on the expressway for a 1/2 hour before coming down
so it is warmed up well.
   not sure how accurate this is but couldn't hurt
