Subject: ? Upside Down Cold Start Injector-82

Hi All,

My 82 Vanagon's cold start injector is not working.  I took it off and
looked things over and things appear to be fine.  When I put it back on I
noticed that I had previously installed it upside down! (oops)  There is
an arrow indicating direction on it that I did not notice before.  How
would this AFC injector work when installed arse-backwards?  Now that it
is right side up, it still doesn't cold-start (I've been spraying starter
fluid into the large vacuum line).   Not having a fuel pressure tester,
I'm not able to do the Bentley's testing routine.  8-(

I have the Vanagon sold as soon as I get it fixed.  Any ideas?
