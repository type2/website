Subject: Can your Baywindow Bus be a Star, in miniature? 

Saw this on the Pelican Parts 911 forum, but noticed that there is a baywindow
bus connection.

Looks like Johnny Lighting has the &quot;castings&quot; for the baywindow buses, so you
can enter your bus's photo in a contest. If they choose your car to be
replicated in an upcoming program, your photo will appear on the packaging, and
you will receive one case (12) of your vehicle as payment!

Here's the link:

I think it's interesting to see that the baywindow bus is starting to get more
popular in the vw toys department. I'll have to start checking my local toy
stores more often now that I know that JL will be producing a Volkswagen. &quot;Bay
Window&quot; window bus or camper, 1970-79 :)

Enjoy,
