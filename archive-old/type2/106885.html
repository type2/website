Subject: Re: [T2] Sway bars

&gt; Front only or front and rear, never rear only (or bigger rear bar) b/c a
&gt; stiffer rear end leads to oversteer. Fun on the track but heart stopping
on
&gt; a wet mountain road I'd bet.
&gt; 
&gt; This info is based on an old suspension book I have.

I know it was said that stiffening the rear without stiffening the front
would result in increased oversteer (ie. the backend wants to swing around).
This is contrary to everything I've ever read or experienced.  I've only
ever dealt with smallish sports cars (Hondas and Porsches) on tight tracks,
so maybe muscle cars are affected differently?  Either way, the bus doesn't
fit that bill.  David Schwarze - I know you've got a lot of track time in
your Mustang - what say you?

In my experience, a stiffer backend results in understeer (ie. the front end
pushes out).  As someone else mentioned, under spirited driving, the bus is
prone to lots of understeer already so you really don't want more of it.

I put the oversized front bar on my 73 Westy this past Summer, but was
unable to install the rear bar (due to the 5 sp tranny conversion).  I can
tell you from experience that during very spirited driving the front bar
reduces understeer without providing any noticeable oversteer
characteristics.  I'm sure there are a few listees who can vouch for my
extreme driving habits :)

If you can't spring the bucks for both bars, but want to improve handling
(assuming you're already running proper tires and your balljoints, tierods,
link pin, etc. are all in good condition) then adding just the oversized
front bar is a definite plus.

YMMV
