&gt; Hello Robert  I have done the water injection and it works very well 
&gt; except
&gt; that you have to keep putting water in there  :)      The way it works is
to
&gt; make a hooka   system pipe. Use a very strong bottle not soft plastic as it
&gt; will suck it  together, put  a two hole stopper on top. get an air stone
&gt; like
&gt; that used  in aquaiums , put this on the inlet pipe thur one hole and down
&gt; to the
&gt; bottom of  the bottle , now if you were smoking this would have a bowl on
&gt; top, the other  hole has an outlet pipe that just goes thur the stopper  but
&gt; not
&gt; into the  water, run a hose with a valve in it to a port below the carb.
&gt; fill
&gt; with water  and start the engine, dial the action using the valve in the
&gt; outlet hose so that  you get just water vapors and drive.   Later and have
&gt; fun

Not to start another oil/tire thread, but which brand of bottled water gives
bet-
ter results... Domestic or imported...Enquiring minds want to know... ?-)
