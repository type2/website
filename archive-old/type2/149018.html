Subject: after market tach etc, oil

I have an 82 Westy automatic.  What is the simplest Tach to install and is there a simple way to add a oil temp and oil pressure gauge too?   Thanks to all for helping me get used to being in a air cooler again after so many years of Vasser Boxers and the ill fated 97 EVC I sold in Jan. I changed the oil and am running 3/4ths Valvoline 40 wt. with a 1/4 Lucas Oil Stabilizer....quiets everything down but my mileage dropped significantly so I am considering going to a synthetic 20w-50 and adding the Lucas Synthetic stabilizer.  No leaks under the van at this time.  
Chuck
