Subject: Re: Tight intake valve

Well, we couldn't get the .004 (smallest we got) feeler gauge into the
gap. So can't say if it was metal to metal, but it was pretty tight. So
we just backed it off to .006 and she seems to be holding up just fine.
Definitely feels better on the road.

We'll see how it goes for the next 3,000 miles (maybe less). Now that
I've got a supervised valve adjustment under my belt (and I *did* do it
right in Texas, maybe a tad loose, tho), I'm a lot more comfortable with
the idea of doing this procedure myself on a regular basis.

I'll check back with you in a couple of weeks. :-) Since I don't have a
spare engine lying about, I'm interesting in seeing what you find.

&gt; &gt; So, my #4 intake valve was tight. Seems I remember George Lyle asking
&gt; &gt; something about this recently, but there wasn't much public response
&gt; &gt; to
&gt; &gt; the question. So, what's *that* all about?! I thought it was typical
&gt; &gt; to
&gt; &gt; have tight exhaust, not intake, valves.
&gt; 
&gt; How tight is tight?  Did it close up a few thousandths or was it
&gt; metal-to-metal like mine?
&gt; 
&gt; Since my engine was tired anyway, I put in a new one.  After three full
&gt; days of removing, disassembling, cleaning, painting, reassembling, and
&gt; reinstalling I'm not in any mood to look at the offending head.  Ask me
&gt; in a couple of weeks :)
