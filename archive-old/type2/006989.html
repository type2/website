Several years back I had all ignition controlled electrics cut out on me.
The only thing that would work with the key was the starter motor but
that wasn't much good without electric to the coil etc.

In my case I traced this to a loose connection at the ignition switch.
The wire was chared due to over heating, considered myself lucky not
to have had a fire.

Although your problem may not be identical to mine it does sound like a
short or bad connection in the ignition circuitry.

You asked &quot;Anything I should check first thing in the AM?&quot;
I say - you've had a lucky escape, don't use your precious bus till
you've fixed this!
