&lt;&lt;I had some folks stop by the house today looking for an awning for their 
'83 AIRcooled Vanagon. I know zilch about these models and where to get 
parts, so if anyone has one for sale or know where to locate one, please 
email me off list at VWandSTUDEBAKER_at_rocketmail_dot_com
 
Thanks,
David&gt;&gt;

I have some cool German awnings that clamp to the raingutter.  What type are
they looking for?  These awnings will roll or fold up and stow under your rear
seat.  I have 2 different sizes and optional side walls.

Check my web pages if they ever come back up.
