&gt; A friend of mine just got an '86 VW Crewcab transporter. They weren't sold
&gt; here in the states as far as I know. He got it from a Marshall's seized
&gt; property auction. They had hidden the drugs in the under bed storage
...
&gt; perfect intereior and great paint. He only paid $1900 for it and it runs
&gt; great. I've got pictures if anyone is interested.

&gt; The reason why I'm posting is that I was amazed at how much room there is
&gt; in the cab area of the truck. Especially the crew seat. So what years were
&gt; these vanagon trucks in production? This was a watercooled one...but did
&gt; they make aircooled ones? Even though we're down here in Texas and he
&gt; bought it here, it was originally delivered to Canada. I've heard that's
&gt; the place to look for one to bring to the states. Did they sell them in
&gt; Mexico as well? I'm thinking one of these might be something I'd be
&gt; interested in getting.

Canada got a lot of late bus stuff that the US didn't.  I'm not sure how
straightforward it was to bring them down, as they were never sold here
and are too new for the magic &quot;25 year&quot; grace.  Obviously, some folks can
do it!

Since the early wedgies were aircooled, I suspect that the early wedgie
pickups were also aircooled.  Were these imported to the Great White
North?  I doubt that Mexico got any, since they were getting the Bay buses
even when the wedge was imported to the US.  Perhaps South Africa?

The obvious way to import is to get one in Canada, load it up with
something illegal, have someone else get caught with it in Texas, and then
buy it at a sheriff's auction!  :)  Instant legal title!
