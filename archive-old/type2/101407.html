Subject: Supplemental blower in 79' Westy not working

Does anyone happen to know if the supplemental blower in a 79' is on it's 
own circuit or what, if anything, shares the circuit with it? It's simply 
not working which means that my windows don't defrost, and I can't figure 
out what has happened. The inline fuse is fine, and the connections (+ and 
ground) both seem allright. Any ideas?

Freezing and unable to see anything in Salt Lake City, UT,
Jared
79' Westy
