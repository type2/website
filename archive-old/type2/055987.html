Subject: EGR update

Dear List,  IT seems the plot has thickened with my EGR valve.  The spot on
the air plennum (left rear corner) is flat and has no holes or screws for
EGR connection.IT is just clean stamped sheet metal..
      I talked extensively with Jim at OLDVOLKShome and we have concluded
that I may have an '80 vanagon plennum on my '79 rebuild.  He says that the
'80 vanagon is the only 2.0 liter built without an EGR valve.  Though he
also says that '79 California has a different part listed for its plennum
(different from other '79's etc..) but has no description or illustration to
clarify.   THe strange thing is he says that the '79 california does have
and EGR valve listed as one of its parts.   WHo knows what I got under the
hood!!  IT is certain though that I do not have an EGR.....  Oh well.
I have taken the bus to a knowledged mechanic to try and track down any
vaccum leak I may have.  I believe that it may be causing my inability to
get idle rpm higher than 800,  and also may be leaning my mix and causing
excessive combustion temps..... I hope he finds something deifinitive.  I am
preparing to drive her across the oven of Missouri, Kansas and Colorado, and
would rather not experience a meltdown........
    I did test my DECEL valve as prescribed in Bentley.  i was told that a
breach in the diapragmn of the valve will cause a leak.  The bentley says to
disconnect from &quot;s hose&quot;, plug &quot;s&quot; hose, then accelerate the throttle to
3,000 rpms then let up on it suddenly...  At this point feel for any suction
at the DECEL valve.  Well I felt no suction at all.  Perhaps this is where I
am leaking.....   Jim at oldvolks has informed me that VW/Bosch stopped
making the DECEL valves 2 years ago.  SO I am looking for a CALI '79 Decel
Valve.... Jim at Oldvolks is on the lookout too.   Anyone who has a '79 Cali
parted out let me know.
    If anyone has any experience in tracking down vaccum leaks, or knows of
notorious spots for them, please let me know.  Thanks
