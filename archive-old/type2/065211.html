Subject: Brake Master Cylinder advice?

- -----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----

Hello, and apologies for my contribution to the previous rant :-)

I am removing the brake master cylinder from my 1969 bus, and I'm 
a little stuck at the clevis pin.  Seems the pin is rusted to the 
clevis so hard that the ball peen hammer and punch method is not 
enough. 

I think my next attempt will be vise grips with a hammer (get it to 
turn and then it might hammer back out) or else heating it may help.
I've gotten out rusty bolts before but this one is particularly stuck.
Hacksaw time?  (I do not think the clevis pin comes with the new cylinder,
and it is a fairly weird part to try to get at a LAPS)
Is there another approach I could take?  I'm wont to 
remove the whole brake pedal assembly, and not sure that will help 
anyway.  It'll end up being simple to do, but I want to throw this 
to you experienced folks.  Muir is vague, and chilton only has bug
brakes.

I realize that I've got a lot of bolts that haven't turned since 1968,
so there are certain kinds of advice I'm not looking for %-).

My other car is a 1959 Chevy Impala...
