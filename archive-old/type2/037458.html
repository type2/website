Subject: 12 years in storage! what to do?

Hello:

I have recently purchased a 1972 VW camper that had been sitting garaged for
the past 12 years.  It was running &quot;good&quot; when it was put into the garage.
It was a garage with a gravel floor however.  The body needs sanding and a
new paint job, the engine is clean.  And after replacing a few parts I got
it running again.

What I need are suggestions on what to do to it or check to avoid trouble in
the future

I have already:
changed oil/filter
changed gas
checked spark plugs
new points, condenser
new battery, cleaned terminals
checked brake wear
replaced tires
cleaned oil bath air filter

Any suggestions or stories are welcomed and encouraged...

Also it has a ice box and sink, is there any cleaning that I should do to
either of those, or do I need to replace the reservoir?

Lastly, what is the best way to fix the floor, (some of the tiles have
fallen off and the wood underneath is deteriorating.

Thanks


Andy Martin
