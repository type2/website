Subject: distributor readings

--=====================_889472414==_

hi everyone..i have another distributor question for the list. i'm runnin a 1600DP in my 70'Westy w/a 34pict solex. i've recently switched my distributor over from a 009 to an 010 with the vaccuum and centrifugal advance. the actual #is 0 231 170 010. 
anyways..i've finally picked up a timing light to check my advance. and i was wondering if someone could tell me how these readings look. 
-my idle w/vaccuum connected is around 820rpm. 
-w/vaccuum disconnected it shoots up to 1000rpm. 
-at idle w/vacuum disconnected and pluged, i'm timed at 7.5BTDC.
-at 2000rpm w/vaccuum disconnected and plugged, my advance goes to 20BTDC. 
-w/vaccuum connected at idle(820rpm), i'm at 10degrees after TDC. 
-and w/vaccuum connected at 2000rpm my advance goes to 7.5BTDC. 

i'm gonna do somemore reading on distributors and vaccuum advance tonight, but i wanted to get your opinions also.
thanks for your time and attention. and any advice that u can pass my way, is always appreciated. 
have a gr8wknd!! *shine on* -Chris
