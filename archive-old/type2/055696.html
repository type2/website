Subject: Gas Gauge

Listvolk:
Since I've owned my 79 westy, (8 years) the gas gauge hasn't worked. I
finally broke down and installed a bright shiny new sending unit from RMMW.
Now the gauge reads full (pegged) until the fuel level in the tank gets
down to about 1/3 to 1/2 tank.  It does seem to be accurate at the bottom
end, (i.e. when the tank is nearly empty, the gauge reads nearly empty).

Is it normal for type 2 gauges?  I've seen funky reading gauges in other
VWs but this seems a little funkier than normal.

Is there a way to put a resistor in the circuit to increase resistance so
the gauge reads more accurately?

Could the sender unit be defective?  Its a Bosch unit and looks exactly
like the one that came out.  Resistance readings range from 6.2 ohm (full)
to 63 ohm (empty).

When installing the sender unit in the tank, do the male spade connectors
on the on the sender face toward the rear of the bus or the front?  Please
be as explicit as possible.

Thanx,

Tim Woenker
