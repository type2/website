Subject: Start of part to sale

We took a sizable deposit on the 78 Westy. The kids cried and have not yet gotten attached to the Vanagon yet. It will come with time...
I have a ton of parts I need to sell and will start out slowly with the following. 
A used good shape distributer with a new never used pertronix installed. Advance works correctly and no vacumn leaks. Was my spare incase of point/condensor failure. Was going to swap out when points went bad and never got around to it. Number on distributer is:
022 905 205S from a 78 Westy I would like $75.00 inlcuding priority shipping to the 48 states.

I have two new in package german rear rubber brake lines.  Part numbers:
211 611 775 B and 211 611 755 C  purchased for the 78. Both for $15.00 including shipping to the 48 states.

Last for this post is 5 heater levers, 3 red and 2 blue from a 78 bus. They are all faded except one of the reds in still dark red. Other wise in great shape. I was able to polish a couple up for my bus to look good.
All for 12.00 including shipping to the 48 states.

Any questions email me at: wmonk_at_snet_dot_net (My netscape address had been pretty shady lately)

Thanks,
Bill M
Mystic,CT
