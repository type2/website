Subject: extra westybed pics (later bus)+other goodies

I finally took pics and made a 16 pic composite with labels; please
p-mail me if you were one of those interested in the design of my third
bed in the 78 Westy or if you have an archive it can be placed at- it
holds a full adult and spans from the front dash area along the sink
cabinet, with full access still to everthing except the glovebox.  If
you look closely, you'll also see my added 3-person seatbed (from a 74)
and the location of the 12v fridge when I need one! Also the flush
cabinet made from the spare tire cover and the flipup table in the
sliding door!
     I also took some pics of the poptop canvas replacement, doing the
opposite, screwing in the bottom first and stapling the top last.
