David:

Sounds like good advise.  The best thing to do is use a stock Doghouse
system with the thermostat system intact.  Use an oil temp and cylinder
temp Gauge to make sure everything is staying within a safe temp range.  If
you find that the oil temp is climbing above the safe range occasionally
under harsh circumstances (extremely hot weather, hill climbs, etc.) then
adding an additional oil cooler inline after your full flow filter with an
oil thermostat and a pressure regulating pump cover might be in order to
stablize things.  

David, I had a plastic bag incident about 10 years ago with my Bug. What a
mess! C.F. 

Thank you!

 David Schwarze said to Chris:
 
 I hate to say this but you are SO wrong!  Take the following scenario as
 justification for my opinion - you are driving down the road and
 unbeknownst to you a plastic bag gets sucked into your side scoop and into
 your engine fan.  The driver with gauges notices that his CHT and oil temp
 are suddenly going up very fast, pulls over and removes the bag.  The
 driver with no gauges motors happily along until his engine overheats and
 locks up.
