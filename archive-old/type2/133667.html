Hi Folks,

If you do mostly highway driving, 50 hours per oil change is a good rule of 
thumb -- an average speed of 60 mph for 3000 miles equals 50 hours.  If 
you're driving mostly around town, 75 to 100 hours is a better ballpark 
figure.  If you mix your driving, just remember the old high school physics:
distance = velocity x time
time = distance / velocity

Of course, having a working odometer is also a great way to measure 
mileage...

Good Luck!

So how many hours constitutes an oil change?

I've heard 25 hours...
