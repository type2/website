GL 3/4/5 meets or exceeds pressure resistance specs for all 3, but the
additives are corrosive to Brass syncros, so it will eat them up... figure
cut your tranny life in half. So technically they can put 3/4/5 on one
bottle but its misleading...

Get stuff where the highest rating is gl4, if it says Gl5 anywhere on the
bottle run away!  Straight GL4 is available at NAPA, Pep-boys, and jiffy
lube (bring in your own cotainer and they'll fill it, but you are better
off finding a NAPA or a Pepboys)

take care,

p.s. I just dont understand VW people.  They will all rabidly follow VW's
recommendations for engine oil, but the moment you tell them that VW
recommends GL4 for the tranny they defend using GL5 and wont switch, i
just dont get it.  Had one vw mechanic describe that GL5 was fine because
he knew someone that had a 59 van that went a million miles on 10
transmissions... to me thats a flying endorsement for GL4 as a vw tranny
should be good for more than 100k...
