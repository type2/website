&gt; Ecellent! A man after my own heart. Fix with what you have, or, as my
father would say, &quot;Make it do or do without.&quot;
&gt; Congratulations

Thanks, Dave, my Dad says something similar. :O)

However, sometimes the journey from quandary to solution can take unexpected
turns.  Try this one, but be forewarned.  If you know a little about casting
and try to read it while using your computer and drinking Sprite, don't.
Someone read it and mentioned something about snorting Sprite out through
the nose and spraying the keyboard... [grin]
