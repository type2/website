in my 79 I have noticed one very good reason for the sliders in the
middle seat section. With the drivers window open only there is quite a
bit of noise/wind directed toward the driver. When I also open the
slider behind me the noise/wind drops a lot. I still get circulation in
the bus, but much more plesant.
