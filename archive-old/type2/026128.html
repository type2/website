Sounds to me like the TDC sensor wire.  The pickup is mounted on the rear of
the case against the flywheel and there are pin(s) on the flywheel which
cause a pulse to be generated.  It was used to hook up to VW's diagnostic
equipment so isn't normally plugged into anything.  On my bus the wire is
light grey and the plug is black with a rubber cover on the end to keep out
the dirt.

&gt; connected end meanders down around and under the central area of FI
&gt; components -- I couldn't determine where it actually goes to
