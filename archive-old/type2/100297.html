Subject: Dule carb to single Good or Bad idea?

Hi everyone.

   I have a 72 Devlivery Bus with a 74 1800cc dule carb pancake engin.  I 
want to make it a singal carb engin but i have been told by one person that 
its not a good idea.... Has anyone done this?  what are the 
advantages/disadvantages? Is it worth the time and money? But my main 
question is if its a good or bad idea and why?  Any help would be great.  
Thanks
