Subject: RE: [T2] burning bus

Hi Folks,

I used to keep a can of gas in the Bus for emergencies, but I removed it 
because it was too tempting.  Like the time I dropped a cylinder in the 
middle of the Nevada desert.  Or the time the solenoid froze and I was stuck 
at the bottom of a hill in the snow.  Or the time I was camping alone in a 
Utah canyon and I drained the battery tracking down a vacuum leak that kept 
the engine from starting.  Or the time I burned a valve and had to get 
another vehicle for my daily transportation.

But, then I think of all the great times I had in the Bus, and I'm glad I 
never used that can of gas to destroy it.  Heck, if I had a dollar for every 
time I thought of burning my Bus, I'd barely have enough money for a tank of 
gas.  Like suicide, it's a permanent solution to a temporary problem.  Take 
heart, friends.  Broken parts can be fixed.  All it takes is time and money, 
and a positive attitude.

Good Luck!
