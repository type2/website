All this was done.  Silicone lube, the cord to pull the lip over, et cetera.
I was expecting it to be as easy as you indicate, but it is not.  It does
not &quot;slide in place&quot;, it is a fight.  It slides partly in place, but not
quite.  Gently pushing with the palm of the hands is insufficient.  If it
didn't have to whack it, believe me, I woudn't have taken that risk.  I used
an OEM German seal, and it was a tight fit.

Its still a tight fit, as it should be otherwise it wouldn't be a seal.
Temperature was about 10 degrees celcius. (don't know Farenheight
equivelant).  The windshield had to be pushed into place to get it to seat
in the opening.  The most &quot;gentle&quot; way of doing so was whacking it
carefully.  The hammer hit a 6inch wide piece of plywood against the glass,
not the glass directly.  I did ensure the metal was clean and smooth, and
took the time to repair some rust pits before replacing the glass.

I have done a bug windshield before, it was a lot easier.  It just popped
into place once the lip went over, sort of as you suggest.  The Type 2 was
more of a fight.

I would appreciate your feedback on the topic of sealant.  There is a
posting from someone who said that a sealant should be applied.  I
understood that sealants were necessary or recommended, that the rubber
would make the seal if properly set on clean metal.  What's your view?
Thanks in advance.

Derek,

    I don't mean to disagree with you, and I'm certainly not here to put you
down, but I would never hit a windshield, or the seal with a hammer,
plywood, or my hand,  no matter how carefully or softly, a whack is a whack!
    I think you were very lucky not to have broken your glass. I'll bet it
wasn't cold in the shop where you were working.
    Please consider trying this next time. Make sure the glass your working
with is warm, warn and stretch out the seal slightly, get a helper to hold
the seal as you go around the glass, use a length of 10 gauge wire to pull
the seal in with, wrap the wire in the grove so the ends over lap at the
bottom middle of the glass, liberally spray the rubber seal and windshield
opening with silicone spray lube, with a helper place the glass in place
with the wire in the grove, have your helper follow as you pull the wire
around the glass a little on one side and the other applying even pressure
with the palms of his hands. The glass/seal should slide in place, you may
need to work the seal in place with a nylon glass tool (body shop supply
store $2.00) by &quot;picking&quot; the rubber over the lip with the tool. The deal
is, if the rubber is in place the glass should also be in place. It's also a
good idea to make sure there are no sharp points or edges in the windshield
opening, and that it is very clean. seals with chrome moldings should have
the molding installed first.
    Well I hope you take this as it was intended, good luck next time.
