Subject: Re: [T2] Re: [VB] VW Bus story in Tucson paper...

Thank you, Terry Wolfe and Wade Rodman, and Erin Beatrice!
Hey! After reading this, I wondered to myself.. Can you be an honorary
member of AIRS if you stop to change a flat tire on another make/model with
a VW bus? I did that once! I would like to get involved with AIRS later on,
maybe. I just have too much on my own plate right now. But it is a very good
thing.
