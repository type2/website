Dan,

The dished washer that VW used to place on the shaft just before the C/V
was slid on has been deleted.  If you have one or found one in the rebuild
/boot kit you got, don't use it.

&quot;clean enough&quot; is bright and sparkly, as usual.  If you have a bit of
burnt-on grease darkening the races, try a soft (brass) wire brush and
carb cleaner.  If the races are discolored from heat, then there is not
much you can do.

                           Steve Dolan
