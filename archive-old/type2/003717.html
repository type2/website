Yes, the pump should run WHEN you crank the engine and stop when you stop
cranking IF the engine is not running.
The pump ''run'' signal when cranking comes from the starter solenoid and goes
to the double relay.
The pump ''run'' signal when the engine is running comes from the air flow meter
and goes to the double relay.

Slide under your bus and look up at the starter. You should see about 6 wires
under the threaded stud and 2 push ons. Look at the push ons.....one will be
about 4mm thick and red/black, that is your crank wire from the ignition switch.
The one that is red/white and about .5mm thick goes to the double relay. Unplug
it from the spade and touch it to the post with all the wires going to it. You
should hear the pump run. If it doesn't, go check both plugs on the double
relay. If they are connected.... replace the relay. If it runs, then leave the
ignition turned on and remove the back half of the air cleaner assembly. Stick
your finger or a long dowel in the square hole. Move the flap. When the flap
moves, the pump should run. If it doesn't, either the double relay or AFM is
bad.

Maybe a dumb question.....is the in-line fuse for the back-up lights connected
to the positive side of the coil? It lays along the left channel where the aux.
battery would be. It is a black wire. The black wire goes to the in side of the
fuse holder and then goes off to the double relay....it powers up the relay when
the key is on. [the out side of the fuse goes to the back -ups]



&gt; Should one be able to feel the Fuel pump move or
&gt; something when cranking?  Is it right in front of the
&gt; fuel filter like I think this thing is?  Also, the
&gt; tank leaks, so I know that is something I need to do.
&gt;
&gt; I would really like to get her to fire up, just so I
&gt; feel better about having her.
