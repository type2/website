  Many Thanks

I have just checked the van and it was the front off side wheel bearing.

&gt; Dear All
&gt;
&gt;  My 73 Bus has started making a nasty judder when braking and cornering at
&gt;  the same time. This is also accompanied by a kind of knocking noise (not
a
&gt;  cv joint kind of knock but more of a grinding knock) The brakes fine the
&gt;  rest of the time. I have also noticed a slight vibration through the
&gt;  steering wheel. Any ideas?

Hi Jane,
vibration through the steering wheel would suggest that the wheels are out
of
balance or that the tracking/camber/toe-in needs to be reset; but the
grinding noise would suggest that you need wheel bearings replacing.

These are not expensive, from memory under £20 per side from German And
Swedish and during replacement the tracking/camber/toe-in should be reset as
a matter of course.

But before you spend any money visually inspect the front tyres as the
problem could be caused by a bulge in the tyre wall.

With the noises you are getting I would recommend not using the van for any
distance (or at all) until it's fixed.

Good luck
