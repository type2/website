OK for those that think I am nuts. =20

I have a 1970 single cab...............there is the windshield fluid rese=
rvoir down on the passenger side front.  Looks same as a bug.  In a singl=
e cab, the spare goes in the cab under the front seats............

How do transporters get air pressure for the window washer?   If nnot fro=
m the spare tire, where?

Hi Adam
Are you talking about a Bus, or a Bug.... &lt;surprized look on my face&gt; I d=
idn't
know they *made* a hose that goes from the windsheild washer fluid bottle=
 to the
spare tire, like a Beetle.

Maybe it is a rare option? ?   I dunno,, just asking,,

I have always used a bicycle tire air pump to add the air to the bottle.

Adam, I am not saying there isn't a hose like you asking for,, I have jus=
t never
seen one!.. and that would be interesting to know about :-) I have never =
seen a
million dollars,, But I know *THAT it exists!

No offense intended,, but have YOU seen one of these ??
