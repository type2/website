I just recently purchased my first air-cooled vw :-) ya!  '72 Campmobile
and she is going to need some rust repairs.  I am new at these air-cooled
type II's and was wondering what is the best type of sheet metal to use
for those areas that will require such mending.  i.e. gauge and
compostion?  Also, I would like to thank all the type II mailing list
members for there warm welcome and there nice replys.  It's great to be a
part of such a group of people.  Keep up the great work. Thanks from a
young and enthusiastic new type II owner.

p.s.  If any might have some rust repair advice for a novice I am open
ears.  Thanks.
