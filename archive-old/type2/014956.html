	My travels have taken the '74 poptop though Baja, Anza Borrego, Arizona,
etc. I'm using Bridgestone reenforced sidewall tires and have had good luck
with them. They are backed up by KYB gas shocks and I carry a couple of
cans of flatfix just in case. The Bridge stones drive well on the freeway
and have lasted well. Good luck!
