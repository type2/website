Subject: [T2] Crank Fan, and flaps? + GEX?

&gt;  I'm curious exactly how I can remove the crank fan? I see that it's
&gt; attached by 3 bolts. What can I do to hold the crank in place so that I
&gt; can get enough force to undo those three crank-fan bolts? I'm hesitant to
&gt; use the center crank bolt... what have you guys done in the past to
&gt; replace a crank fan?

I'm assuming the engine isn't in the car?  Then the best and easiest way is
with a flywheel lock which is a &lt; $10 item.  Until I got my flywheel lock I
always just asked my wife to step down to the garage and hold the flywheel
with gloved hands.
