Volks,

The AVP rebuild is almost ready to go back into the 81 Westy......I can't
wait to get that baby back on the road.

But, there is one last problem.  The AC compressor clutch is bad.  I took
the compressor to a large local AC parts and service shop to have the
clutch replaced but was told that I would be much better off to replace the
old York compressor with a modern Sanding (not sure about the spelling)
compressor.  This compressor supposedly consumes less power from the engine
but is more efficent.  They have an adapter bracket that looks like it
might fit.  The hose end connections are different but the shop offered
several options for solving this.

I wonder if this will work and if the tin will fit back onto the engine
with this setup.

Does anyone have experience with this type conversion.

As always any and all comments are welcomed and appreciated.
