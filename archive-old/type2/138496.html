Subject: RE: [T2] Help BusDepot Donate to Tsunami Victims

Ron,

I really appreciate what you are doing, I'll try and make an order before 
the deadline and hope others follow. Thanks.

&gt;So from now until New Years, 25 percent of the net profits of BusDepot_dot_com
&gt;sales will be donated to Doctors Without Borders, to provide medical relief
&gt;for the victims of this tragedy.
