Hello,

I use Nitrile gloves as I found that I had an allergic reaction to
latex.  Caused the contact dermatitis that Paul Callender
mentioned.  Also, the latex gloves tended to 'melt' off when
exposed to chemicals such as brake cleaner or parts washer
solvent.  The Nitriles last a heck of a lot longer before needing
replacement if exposed to those chemicals.  And they are
much more physically durable as well.  With the latex gloves
it would take 5-6 pairs per each transaxle build but with the 
Nitrile gloves I find that I can do at least one, if not two, builds
per pair.

PS- I use the Harbor Freight specials.  If you catch them on 
sale you should be able to get a box of 100 for $9.00.
