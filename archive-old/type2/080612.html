Subject: '72-'74 exhaust in '77 update

Back before the holiday's I inquired about installing '72-'74 era 
heaterboxes &amp; muffler on my '77. Overwhelmingly y'all confirmed that it 
would bolt up.  Much thanks to Nikki Elko for the quality used heater boxes 
and BusDepot for straightening out the stainless steel muffler problem- in 
the end it worked out fine. Parts in hand, I drove upstate NY over the 
holidays to use my father's lift and heated garage.  I must have read 
similar advice here before because I was careful to file every mating 
surface shiny and clean. After some jiggling and 1 horrible exhaust leak on 
#3 where the gasket didn't line upright (you wouldn't believe how it tore up 
a brand new copper gasket), it is beautifully quite compared to my old 
strait pipes and glass packs, leak free, and hopefully ready for Mr. 
Inspection.

I currently don't have any hanger on the boxes so just the exhaust studs are 
supporting the whole thing (that SS muffler ain't light!) so I'm looking for 
someone to weld something for me from the old hanger.

Next step is get it inspected and registered in NJ...


Thanks for all the comments and feedabck, and happy bussing
