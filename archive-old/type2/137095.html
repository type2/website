Ok, I have now tested the switch.  I gave power to 30 and with the 
switch turned all the way counter clockwise, terminal 53a has power 
(nowhere else).  I turned it one notch and power to 53 only.  One last 
click, power to 53b.  This makes sense to this Kooky Math Teacher, is 
this the way the switch ia supposed to work?
