Subject: Re-attaching brakes lines to new master cylinder (again)

Hi Everyone,

First thanks to the many people who gave helpful advice about how break line
couplings can be a real PITA to get on.

I've spent quite a few hours attempting to get the brake lines on completely
straight. No, dice! Do these things actually go on completely straight? Or do
they have an ever-so-slight angle?

It seems like both have the same slight off-center angle which is why I'm asking
the question.

The lines are in tight right now. What do I do now? I'm a little hesitant to
drive it but suppose I could drive slow and really hammer the brakes to see what
happens?

Comments and suggestions are appreciated.

Thanks,
Harry
