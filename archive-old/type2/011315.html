&gt;jeff was looking for camper bed ideas.
&gt;i'm new to this, don't know what a 'bay window' is???
&gt;i built a bed in my 71 bus [the more common passenger model, how is this
&gt;model commonly referred to?????] w the back seats removed and have been
&gt;happy w the design for 16 years.
&gt;happy to share ideas [507] 629 8042.
&gt;
&gt;best wishes

I also have just a regular bus.  It's official name, such as on the 
insurance info, is stated as a Kombi.  I've also heard these referred to as 
Station Wagons.  I've always called it a bus or &quot;The Bus&quot; but definitely not 
a Micro Bus.  Purists will have a fit if you call a late model bay window a 
Micro Bus.

I also installed a custom homemade bed in my regular bus.  I just removed 
the back 4 person seat and made a platform that extended the hump over the 
engine compartment up to the middle 3 person seat.  This made a long enough 
(when laying slightly diagonal) area to sleep quite comfortably.  You can 
then store all your gear underneath the platform and still carry passengers 
in the one back seat.

Also, what's the deal with campers and Westies.  It seems alot of the time 
when I tell people about my bus, or try to sell it, they don't seem to care 
after they find out it's not a camper.  I know the campers are cool and all, 
but regular busses are just as good.
