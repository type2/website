Subject: Re: 412 engine in a bus??

&gt;       I've been trying to help this guy with his new bus.  He says
&gt;that when he bought the bus they told him it was a 73 but all thing
&gt;point to a 72 (VIN and door jamb sticker, he has not got a chance to
&gt;relook at the turn signals).  He also says that the engine number is EA
&gt;100905, which seems puzzling.  From what I can figure out this is a 74
&gt;engine from a type 4 vehicle (412 station wagon) with 80 hp and 1700cc. 
&gt; Now can this be right
&gt;are they the same kind of engines as the bus pancake and if not what
&gt;modifications would have been done to it?? It has a single carb on it
&gt;now, did it originally come with FI.
&gt;
&gt;Thanks Tim

The engines are basically the same, except that the oil filler and dipstick 
on a type 4 are accessed from the top (unless the case &amp; fanshroud were 
modified when the engine was put in the bus).  This could be inconvenient 
if the bus is in fact a '72 (no top engine access hatch).  The type 4 would 
originally have had the older hardwired fuel injection system also used on 
some 914's and, I believe, type 3's.  This is not my favorite system, and 
besides would have be a pain in the neck to install in the bus.  The carb 
is probably an improvement.
