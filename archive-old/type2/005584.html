When Kemperink came up on the List I thought of Ken Madson [The Bus Co.] in
Seattle, and asked him about his rig.  Turns out he has 2 of them.

Following are pertinent excerpts from Ken's replies to me.

Fred Stoermer
Tacoma, WA  USA
-----------------------------------------------

Yep, and as a &quot;pervert/nut case&quot; I own two of them:

A '67 outfitted as a &quot;Winnebago&quot; (sink, fridge, stove, furnace, toilet, etc)
powered by a Subaru 1800 ES motor.

And then &quot;Chuck&quot;, my parts hauler '69 which you have seen.

I think my '69 (at least) has an &quot;alpine&quot; (mountainous region) tranny, and
is the smoothest (and high revving) early bay I have ever driven.  I have
only seen one other here in the states.  (a '67 owned by Charlie Hammil down
in SoCal??)
-----------------------------------------------

Sure, post on the Type 2 List, if there is any interest.   A picture of
&quot;chuck&quot; is on the opening page of my website:    www.thebusco_dot_com/

Jack Maynard (WetWesties) used to have a picture of &quot;Betsey&quot; (our '67) on
his website.
