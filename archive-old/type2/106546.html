&lt;&lt;  Arkansas requires neither smog nor safety inspections. All you California
&gt; people have to do is re-register your vehicles in Arkansas and you are home
&gt; free!! Renewing your registration can be done via the mail. I don't know how
&gt; stringent they are in your proving residency status.

And what makes you think that California doesn't have draconian rules
governing that also? :-(
 &gt;&gt;

Usually you have two weeks to change the registration (at least in NJ).
You'd have a tough time explaining your constant presence in California
with Arkansas plates (and an Arkansas license). Besides, it's also in-
surance fraud if you happen to have an accident...What're you gonna
tell'em...You were commuting to your job in LA from Arkadelphia...?-(
