Jan, I would not worry about compromising the &quot;stock-ness&quot;  of the bus. 
Take me for instance, I am getting ready to swap front beams from a 1972
Westy to my 1970 bus.  This way I have disc brakes.  Think of this as an
added safety feature.  If you look at the bus you will not really be
able to notice the change - and hell, as far as I am concerned, it only
adds to the value of my bus.
