Subject: Re: [T2] starting fluid

Access Systems sends:

&gt; ??? I owned a bus company and we had up to 17 buses, it gets pretty cold
&gt; around these parts and we used cases of starting fluid all winter and we
&gt; just sprayed it into the air cleaner.   never did damage any of those old
&gt; Detroit's that I'm aware of.  and these were &quot;MY&quot; buses so I didn't want
&gt; em damaged as I would have to pay for the repair.

I didn't know you *could* damage a Detroit Diesel except through stupid
modifications or neglect. We had two 6V71-powered generators in Berlin that
were installed during the 1960s. They were started and run six hours a week,
plus as many hours as needed for power outages, and never needed any repairs
at all. We pulled them out and sent them back to the US in 1992; whoever has
them now probably hasn't had any trouble either. (I saw the 2404 book on
them. Oil changes and cooler service were about as harsh as maintenance
got.)
