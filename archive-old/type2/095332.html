Subject: engine install issues

good evening list. Well, I changed my clutch plate cause it was the wrong 
one, built and installed my &quot;hoover bit&quot;, and as I sit here, my engine sits 
on a jack, with blocks supporting it becaause I cant get my accelorator 
cable through the fan housing!  Used a piece of copper line, the kind used 
for brake line on a Chevy truck.  Seems like the cut I made in the line is a 
little rough, and the end of the cable may be hangin up on the end.  I 
wiggled it, and re inserted it several times, with no luck of getting it 
through.  Anyone know any secrets?  She is soooooooo close to being running 
after being engineless for 6 years, and almost ending up in the scrap 
yard....  help... :(
