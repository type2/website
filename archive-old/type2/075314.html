I believe this is correct, on my 2.0L air-cooled (80 vanagon) there is the
FI harness. This harness almost operates independently from the rest of the
wiring in the van. Just a few wires go into the FI wiring as Al said below.
6 wires do not go to the fuse block anywhere that I have noticed.

BTW, when I picked up my van the PO had buggered the wiring so he had the
&quot;cold start valve&quot; wired to a switch under the steering column.

&gt; Maybe this is a senior moment for me... but I am pretty sure 
&gt; there are NO
&gt; FI specific wires in the fuse panel (under the dash). And I 
&gt; don't have a
&gt; FI bay to look at right now, just an 80 Vanagon.
&gt; The ONLY wires that have to do with the engine are the black wire that
&gt; goes to the coil, the oil pressure lite, and the alternator 
&gt; light (blue?).

&gt; &gt; Hello all,
&gt; &gt;      This is alot more than I ever planned to ask the
&gt; &gt; list but I don't have alot of options.  My families
&gt; &gt; Pontiac GrandAm crapped out this morning and the only
&gt; &gt; other car we have is my 78 Bay.  Well, its at the shop
&gt; &gt; having the fuse panel rewired.  In short, the mechanic
&gt; &gt; says he cant figure out 6 wires related to the FI.
