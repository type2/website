&gt;  My question for the masses is &quot;Where can I find a
counterweighted crank for my bus&quot;?  I would appreciate any guidance in this
search.

European motorworks sell C/W cranks, no website tho, look at HotVWs mag, but
they're not in every issue lately, maybe every other issue. Also try
www.aircooled_dot_net , John Connoly has a bunch of performance type4 stuff i
think. you can get a stroker too (up to 78mm w/o mods  ????), and 96mm
slip-in P/Cs for about the price of a German set of 94s.  I've heard folks
with bigger engines had probs with the stock FI tho, so maybe a set of dual
weber IDFs. Check out the Type 4rum
http://shoptalk.tunacan_dot_net/bbs/cgi-bin/Ultimate.cgi  and type4 secrets
revealed http://tunacan_dot_net/t4/ and you'll find all kinds of neat stuff.


hope this helps,
