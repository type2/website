Subject: ba6 heater for camping?
Message-Id: &lt;l03130300b398c8e332cc_at_[199.175.106.49]&gt;

I've got a heater booster which will get fixed *soon*. In the meantime I'm
gathering info on the operation of the units.

It sound like one of the key issues with the heater booster is the amperage
draw - it is this that limits how often/how long the heater is used when
parked ie camping.  So what is the draw in real terms?  On a fully charged
auxillaru battery how long can one of these units run?  I know there are a
lot of variables in this question but, pallpark?

And how many times can you run via timer from main battery?

I'm just trying to get some idea of the amount of use I can get from this
unit when camping.  I'm wondering if I'm still going to want to install a
propane rv heater.
