Subject: Re: [T2] Tune-up Freq with Bruck 205; Bosch Qual Decl

Cliff,

Well.. based on my incredible bad luck with &quot;rebuilt by Bosch&quot; generators, I'd
have to say that the Bosch name is no guarantee of quality in my mind... but
still, I sure wouldn't blame Bosch for trouble with a made-by-slaves-in-China
&quot;Bruck Germany&quot; distributor!

Why in Karl Rove's name are you having to replace all that stuff every 1500
miles?  It's definitely normal to check and adjust the timing/dwell at least
that often, along with your valves, but... something must be very, very wrong
if you're your plugs and your rotor are getting murdered.

I'd sure take George's advice on the coil.

- Miles
