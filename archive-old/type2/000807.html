Joe Fournier's cam / cam gear problem brings up one of the weaknesses of our
beloved type4 engines.  These rivets let go FAR too often.  I know of
several engines that this has happened to.  And of course when they do it's
time for a rebuild.  Any movement at all at this connection is just starting
the clock ticking until you have to split the case again.  Al Brase had the
perfect solutions when he said:

&gt;&gt;&quot;...maybe you should tap the cam holes for bolts, face off the area on the
gear and attach the two with bolts.  By doing this you could use your old
gear and keep the lash correct.&quot;

That's EXACTLY	 what you should do.  DON'T just tighten up the rivets by
giving them a whack with a hammer and punch.  Everything is apart right now
so do it right.  My Local VW guru won't rebuild ANY type 4 engine without
bolting the cam gear.  He also automatically replaces those nice friction
fit galley plugs with threaded pipe plugs as well.  He also replace the
valve seats right. (Heads _at_ 450 degrees...seats in dry ice overnight...then
press fit to 9000 lbs.) You know why he does all this?  Because he
guarantees his engines for 12 months and doesn't want to see them again in
his shop.  These are the &quot;Big Three&quot; problems he sees come into his shop
with the type4 engine.  I figure if he fixes these problems just to
guarantee them for 12 months, we'd better do it too when we want our engines
to go 200,000 miles!

Let's keep those engines running forever.  Good luck!
