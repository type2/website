Subject: Re: Online tool source?

Hello, I checked, the website URL is:

http://www_dot_use-enco_dot_com/

can not do on-line orders however, just ask for a catalog.  Seems that LA
residents might want to go to the site right away to find out about a
&quot;$2,000,000&quot; moving clearance sale.  It looks like they really are doing
something special.  It started today.

&gt; Best Source is Enco, unfortunately don't have a phone # or a catalog at hand
&gt; and they probably don't have a WWW but you might check.
