Subject: Re: [T2] throttle cable question

Hi Corbett,

Here's a pic of my Left dual solex. you can see the throttle cable 
running through the right of the pic. Unfortunately the smog hardware 
is blocking sight of the tin at the point where it passes through, but 
you can see that the hole is very close to the transmission.

If the tin is in original condition there will be a socket on the back 
to keep the cable housing in place. Without that fitting in place the 
cable will not take long to  saw through the tinwork. AMHIK. The tin 
will also make a mess of the cable, and the whole works will eventually 
jam or break.

If the socket fitting is gone (Mine broke away from the tin) you can 
create a workable replacement using plastic plumbing fittings available 
at Home Depot.

Happy trails,

&gt; Can anyone tell me the location of the throttle cable on a 73 Westy? 
&gt; Currently
&gt; the throttle cable enters the engine compartment from the right side 
&gt; of the
&gt; transmission. This would be the right side when looking at the engine 
&gt; from the
&gt; back of the bus. This worked fine when the weber was in the bus, but 
&gt; now I am
&gt; switching over to duals and the relay shaft needs to have the cable on 
&gt; the
&gt; left side of the transmission. Is this the correct relay shaft for 
&gt; this year
&gt; bus? Do I just need to move the cable over to the left side of the 
&gt; engine?
&gt; What problems will run into with moving this cable to this side of the
&gt; engine?
