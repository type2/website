Subject: Re: Fuel Pump Pushrod Wear?

&lt;&lt;So, the pushrod in there was 'new' as in brand new 8,500 miles before 
the failure.  I think I read somewhere about some sources providing 
pushrods that hadn't been hardened properly.&gt;&gt;

I recently saw one of these, they are horrible, to me they are quite
easy to identify, they have a zink/grey color and their finish is *very*
rough, the lathe marks are visible, dono were they come/came from and/or
why anyone would buy/use one... I would be looking for metal particles
in the oil though...
