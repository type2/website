Subject: About the oil pump problem

Hi, I just subscribed to the digest.  I was in the list a couple of year ago
and I'm back again.



Just wanted to tell my experience.  I bought a Maxy 3 oil pump from CB
Performance about 3 years ago and recently I re-made the old  Transporter4s
Type4   1.7lt   engine and also had pressure problem; in fact, there was no
pressure at all.  So, being so far away from California,  I decided to
reinstall the original pump and the results were satisfactory. The pressure is
always above spec.



I purchased the Maxy 3 pump because I wanted to install an external cooler but
I guess I just have to install a filter adapter in stead.



Thanks,



Pedro P.Vivas
