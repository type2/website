Subject: Re: [T2] Acceleration woes

Your accelerator pumps did not slowly get bad enough to cause your
problems, and at steady state cruise they are not active anyway.  The fact
that you have the problem at a steady 65mph rules out the accelerator pumps.

Sounds like fuel starvation to me.  Idling takes almost no fuel.  Have your
fuel pressure checked at the carbs - my guess is that you have either a bad
fuel pump or clogged filter.  You can also unhook a fuel line from a carb
and stick it into a soda bottle.  Have someone crank the engine and verify
that a good amount of fuel spurts out in pulses.

&gt;  I have a 74 dual-carb bus which has developed a rather alarming problem
&gt;over the last seven days. When the gas pedal is depressed the enging revs
&gt;climb.... then fall off .. then climb again, with accompanying backfiring
&gt;(very loudly),
