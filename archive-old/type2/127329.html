Subject: Looking for Champagne Edition parts

Is there anyone out there who has any parts for a
Champagne Edition II microbus? Since this version was
only sold in the USA I don't think I will find these
parts over here so I am trying it on the list.

This is what I am looking for:

Champagne edition specific:

- headrests (they are red)
- covering cap and plastic 'tubes' for the headrest
mountings on the bench seats.
- red caps that cover the screws in the trunk
- fresh air duct on the right cabin door
- lower cover for ignition lock (brown)
- door handle to pull the cabindoor shut from the
inside
- the lid for the clove compartment
- ashtray with the manual gearbox-drawing still on it
(brown)
- sliding door panel
- red 'kickpanels' under the dasboard
- any other upholstery panel with the vinyl in good
shape (the board doesn't matter to me much)

The following items are used on other buses as well:

- sliding window left with tinted glass
- the arm rest on the right side of the middle bench


And of course any NOS parts you might have in Saddle
Brown....or any Champagne upholstery?

I am not sure if all parts are possible to send by
mail. But let me know if you have anything and we'll
see.

By the way: I live in The Netherlands.

yours,


Vincent
