&lt;&lt; Off of the carburetor comes a small piece of flexible tubing.
 This flex tubing connects to a double bent piece of rigid steel tubing.
 This steel tube, in turn, connects to another flex tubing that 
 ultimately connects the whole affair to the distributor vacuum port.
 
 Anyone out there got one of these steel tubing pieces as surplus to 
 his/her needs?
 I would really like to get my hands on same.
 This will be used on a 1600 SP engine.
 
 Thanks,
 Bob Perring &gt;&gt;
hello bob     I have some of the vacum tubes , but i'm  in virginia. If you 
don't find any closer  yell and i'll mail you one. By the way always put the 
bend towards the top , to keep gas fumes from the dizzy.      Mark Dearing
