Alex,

     I just bought a 82 aircooled westy.  I have always had bay window
buses.  I paid $5000 for mine but it is running well with 110000 miles on
it.  It also is in good shape.  You can take a look at my web site.  The
Vanagon is heavier hence not as much power.  It is much more stable &amp; quiet
to drive.  Have you ever driven one?  Are you sure you would want to own
one?  Without being able to test drive, I would say it is worth maybe
$1000-1500.  The engine is going to cost between $1000-2000 depends on who
does it.
