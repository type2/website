Subject: How long to run bus to charge a battery?

HI all, 

I just took my 72 camper out of the garage for the
first time in a year. I push started it (helps that I
live on a hill) and got it running, ran it around the
neighborhood for about 10 minutes, it died adn
wouldn;t start. Then I put the battery on a charger
overnight. It wasn;t enough juice in there to crank
the engine.

The battery is 3 years old, has been sitting unused
for about a year.

Do you think it's toast? Or should I have to run the
bus much longer to get the battery charged up from
zero.

thanks
J
