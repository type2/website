Subject: Re: [T2] rebuild 2.0l

Disagree on one point Dave,

Building a brand new engine, especially T4, it's hydraulics all the way.

Do you want to adjust them once, or every 3000 miles?

Quiet and reliable. If you're worried about wear on startup, which I wouldn't be, what kind of wear?, keep them pumped up by starting the engine at least once a day.

Solid lifters are probably 'better' as long as you keep them adjusted.
Hydraulics are low maintenance but give you increased wear on startup.
