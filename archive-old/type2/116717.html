Subject: Re: [T2] Halloween Van Time

&gt;I've done this on several occasions, without any significant problems... 
&gt;Make sure you test the door as much as possible, pull on it, hit it, kick 
&gt;it... do your best to make it fall... I'm still very cautious when i have 
&gt;to drive with the door open... I try to give it a safety catch, if 
&gt;possible...

I will see if I can rig something up (tubular tape -climbing stuff) to 
reinforce
the door. I can't see me driving any faster than 2 mph or so.  We plan on
handing out candy and driving beside our kidlets.

I did notice though, that since my paint was very old
&gt;and faded (my bus is also yellow) and there was no clear coat left, there 
&gt;was a bit of a shiny spot in the paint after the tempra came off, like the 
&gt;tempra moisturized my old paint, and you could still read what it said... 
&gt;this has disapeared with time.  I'm sure it won't be an issue if you have 
&gt;fresh paint.

Thanks! I never even thought of tempra paint.. essentially water colors.
Maybe what I will do is (as mentioned) clean and then wax the heck out of
it.  Maybe scuff the wax a little so it isn't really really smooth so as to 
hold
onto the paint a bit.  That should help with taking it off later.

Here's a prelook : http://www.firestrike_dot_net/van/yellowduckie.jpg

Yellow submarine.. meet yellow rubber duckie.. again a name created
by the kidlets :)

Here's another idea a friend told me about: Guy painted his car a flat
black and used it as a chalk board.  Guess it washes off perfect every time.
Not sure if I would like a black van in the summer time though ;)
