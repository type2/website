Ditto on that.

The &amp;%#$_at_!! DPO had done a very nice job of hopelessly hacking the wiring
and hose routing in my '76 westy and I'm always frightened every time I
stick my hand in the engine compartment for fear of knocking something
loose and not being able to figure out where it's supposed to go.  Crazy!

I'd *love* good detailed diagrams, charts, or a series of good photos
showing what connects to where, and importantly, what the correct routing
is supposed to be.  This guy didn't tie *anything* down or use any of the
little built-in routing clips, and man, I'm just overwhelmed by the whole
thing.  Maybe this winter I'll just *replace* all the wiring and vacuum
hoses in the engine compartment, but I gotta know how the stuff if supposed
to be routed!

To top everything off, he'd remounted the motor about 1 1/2 inches further
back than than it's supposed to go, so I can barely unscrew the oil filler
cap, and the transmission is sticking into the engine compartment!  (Yeah,
a forward shift is on my to-do list, once I figure out what to do...).

Maybe some FFFriday we should schedule a DPO bitch-session...
