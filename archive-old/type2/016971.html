Fellow Listees
Last night on the way home a very weird thing happened and I could use
some advise from the list before I go to the local Mechanic.
As I traveled the freeway at a steady 65 mph the head lights went out!
Not the dash lights or the radio, just the headlights. I was within
yards of an exit that would take me home so I
pulled off. As I continued on the exit ramp the lights went ON! and all
was fine. About 1/4 of a mile later the lights went out again and then
back on. This happened two more times then the lights stayed on for the
remainder of the ride home.
Q. Do I have a short?
Q  Is this my Alternator?
Q  Do I have a loose wire?
Q. Can I replace the Alt without removing the engine?

Has this happened to anyone else? Or does the bus have Gremlins?
Thanks for any help!

George
73 Westy &quot;The Beacon&quot;
PS I have a 914,  2.0 ltr engine with  Auto trans.
