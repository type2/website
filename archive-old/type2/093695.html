Subject: Re: [T2] Further '80 alternator questions

There is a tool made and is gererally available from your friendly 
rolling tool (toy) store.  It looks similar to the strap wrench you see 
on tv.  or you may even be able to use one of the strap wrenches.  
Extremely pricey little toy though which is why one hasnt been added to 
my box yet.  Impact zaps just fine for me and i noted that even the 
dealer doesnt use the fancy tool.
