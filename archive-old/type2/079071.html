7001 Westmoreland Ave
Takoma Park MD (use Mapquest)
301 270 8073
December 9, 2001 1-5 PM

Parking for at least 19 buses in the driveway (1999 record), plus much more
on street. 
Driveway camping for long distance travellers (prior notice appreciated). 
Photos of prior year events at http://volksweb.relitech_dot_com/

This is a family friendly event: bring your significant other, children,
grandparents, whoever, all can be assured that many people attend and chat
about everything but VW buses. 

Bring something to share. Splittie cookies and splittie beer (must taste
like rust, says Dworkin) will be served.

Hope to see you there!  

Tom F.
