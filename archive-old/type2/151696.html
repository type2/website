Subject: Re: [T2] Re: [VB] Re: Fuel tank cleanout (was never assume)

Matt,

Lordy!, you musta been a good kid.&lt;big grin&gt;....me on the other hand had 
to try this stuff out and see for myself.

I have poured gas in an aluminum pie plate and tossed lit matches into it
from 10 feet....the gas put the matches out every time...how boring.
Same with cigarettes as there is generally no *spark*.

However!  Go to the beach, grab a bunch of wet wood into a pile and pour 
about 1/2 cup of gasoline on it.  Assuming the wind is coming in from the 
ocean, stand up wind about 15 feet, toss a match in that direction and 
!look out!....*instant* bonfire.

Same problem as ignition in a car engine...too lean...bad ignition....too 
rich...bad ignition.  This is how tankers carrying volatiles survive 
moving instantly flammable stuff across the ocean....the air above the 
surface of the volatiles is deliberately kept too rich to support 
combustion.

I am not putting a disclaimer on this stuff as I figure you are all old 
enough to know better by now...you are responsible for yourself!&lt;grin&gt;

Cheers, dave

&gt; I have heard, and believe, the above things, and if somebody comes along
&gt; with a cig when you've just poured the gasoline on the driveway, it's
&gt; probably fine.  The problem is that the point of the exercise is to
&gt; evaporate the gasoline into the air, which is sort of the same thing
&gt; that a carburetor is doing.  After a bit you will have a nice cloud of
&gt; air laden with gasoline vapor over your driveway, and having someone
&gt; walk along with a cig at that point could get very interesting.
