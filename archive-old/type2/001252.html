&gt;    i just called RMM today to order some and they said that they
&gt; wouldn't get them for another 6 months....go figure....


They may be waiting on the same ones I am.  I tried to obtain some Brazilian
ones, but after my importer saw the first samples he dismissed them out of
hand.  The rubber quality was fine, but the molding was so poor that several
hours with an exacto knife would have been required to remove all of the
overrun from them before you could install them.  Better quality ones are
promised but delivery time is ??????.  Frankly I'd even take RMM's 6 month
promise with a grain of salt if I were you.  In any event, when they have
them it's a safe bit I'll have them for less...
