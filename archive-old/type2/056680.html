Subject: Front Door Frame Damage

The front end corner of my 73 bus was smashed in, causing the
passenger door to be pushed back about an inch,  which caused the door
to buckle.  I got another door from the graveyard and began to work on
the body, but the frame holding the door will not budge, no matter how
hard I try to persuade it using a large malleable hammer.  I took it
to an autobody place, and was told $600 to just get the frame
straightened out and the put the door on.  I have spoken with several
people, and have heard anything from using a 2x4 wood block and chains
attached to a truck to try to pull it out, to heating the metal and
trying to pound it out.  Any ideas would be appreciated, I hope to
take it on my honeymoon in a couple weeks from San Francisco.
