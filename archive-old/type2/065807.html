Subject: Wanna Buy/Trade?

OK...I've had it!

Does anybody wanna buy my '78 280Z so I can buy this '65 13-Window Deluxe:
 
&gt;1965 13-window deluxe, new paint, dual port (1600?), dual carbs (brand?)
&gt;almost all new rubber, great interior, lowered, bench seat, 12V, purple over
&gt;seafoam green.  $3500/offer

There is something in me that aches when I see or hear of a bus like this, so if 
anyone is remotely interested (I'm near Santa Rosa, CA), let me know, and I'll 
supply more info than this:  Black leather Recaros, silver (needs painted, 
bodywork), recent valve job, will need clutch soon..._dot_comes with extra 
transmission(from a ZX), ......now that I think of it, the seats are worth more 
than the car....

Thom, if you think this guy will trade his bus for a pair of Recaros with a free 
Z-car, let me know....
