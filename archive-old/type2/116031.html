Subject: Re: [T2] Air Vent Covers?

&gt; Does anybody know of such a thing as some kind of cover that goes over the
&gt; outside air vents for the rear. Living here in Seattle, it's starting to get
&gt; wet outside. I get a little nervous knowing that the rain is probably pouring
&gt; into the engine compartment. Or is this a new idea that could make me rich?
&gt; Even washing the van would make these handy...If they do exist...Where can I
&gt; find a pair?

I saw these on a webpage once and the owner said he found them on eBay. He
couldn't remember who the seller was:
