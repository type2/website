Volks,
  I just installed a fuel/air ratio meter. I have a '79 Bus/FI/2.0L with
Calif. emissions. Now heres the trick question. What is the proper way to
adjust the fuel/air ratio. I know that there is a screw on the air box,
however I have been told that the local mech's have taken the top off the
air box and adjusted the big gear. What do I adjust first or do I just
adjust the big gear?? Which was adjust lean/rich??

Any information will be greatly appreciated.
