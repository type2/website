Subject: Re: [T2] to all GA, SC, NC,TN members looking to save an early
  split westy!

Hi Josh,

Don't panic yet. It's quite possible that even if the PO didn't know  
it was worth saving, the wrecker will.

I narrowly missed a vanagon westy this summer that instead was given  
to a wrecker for $30. That wrecker wasted no time at all removing the  
vehicle from the downtown yard and stashing it in their long-term  
storage facility outside of town.

Sure sounds like a great opportunity for somebody...

Happy trails,
