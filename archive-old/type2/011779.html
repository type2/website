Volks,

Tonight I somehow managed to strip the plate where
the set-screw for the points screws in, on my 009 
distributor.  So, I'm going to try to go out junkyard
hunting tomorrow at lunch, but short of that, if 
anyone has a dead 009 laying around and wants to get
rid of the plate that the points mount on, please
let me know how much you want for it and how soon
you can send it.  If you're anywhere near SoCal, 
I'd be willing to come pick it up too, if that's ok.


Essentially, I hope to eventually put the original 
vacuum advance distributor (that came in a parts box 
with the bus) back in the bus, but i'm not ready to 
go and do all that now, so I'd like to get the bus up 
and running again and hopefully without putting too much 
money into the 009 (otherwise I'd consider buying a new one).

thanks,

	t
