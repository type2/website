Subject: Haunted Starter!!


Hi all,

Very strange problem encountered with my starter. I installed a rebuilt bosh
starter for a 73 camper and hooked up the battery and it starts by itself!!!
I am holding the key in my pocket and its starts.  Just to review my
connection, I placed all (5 ?) connections to the one post that does not
connect directly to the starter, and placed the clip on the appropriate
post. I ended up trying them both (one is for fuel injection) but it would
not stop
from self starting. I should note that this rebuild has a third clip post on
the opposite side. Email me directly if you like at gcquaile_at_gcc_dot_ca

I can't figure it out. Help!!
