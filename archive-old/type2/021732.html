Subject: (was)Re: [T2] continually tight valves; now: Two tdc's per cycle

Wink, others:
I often wonder if the valve adjustment procedure IS understood by all who
attempt it.
(And I'm sure it is NOT, judging from what some people have written.)
Understand that each cylinder has TWO TDC's per cycle! That is, it takes TWO
complete revolutions to complete a cycle in a four-stroke cycle engine. (720
degrees)
When you want to adjust the valves the engine MUST be at IGNITION TDC for that
cylinder. In other words, at the end of the compression- beginning of the power
strokes.
The other TDC is at the end of the exhaust- beginning  of the intake strokes.
Are we all together on this?
Any questions? Class?
