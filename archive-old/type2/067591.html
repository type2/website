Subject: M-Code SK = Special Color!                                    

I just received this from VW.  

SK1032 is a special color code.  My 62 Westfalia is blue.  Where the paint
is still in good shape, it looks noticeably darker than Dove Blue.

I'll guess that SK1032 is in the headlight bucket to make sure the chassis
is painted the special color.
