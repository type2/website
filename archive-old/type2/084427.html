Subject: timing

All this discussion about the pros and cons of 009's vs stock has still
left me with an unanswered question.  I have an 009 in my 74 single cab
with type IV and dual weber ICT's.  Is the desired 25 degrees of advance
supposed to be set from the reference point of the factory 7.5 ATDC idle
timing OR from TDC?  I'm really confused...my desire is to find a vacuum
distributor and experiment with it since one of my carbs does have a vacuum
port on it.  But if I'm stuck with the 009, I want my truck to be happy
with it.  Is there a definitive answer out there?  thanks!
