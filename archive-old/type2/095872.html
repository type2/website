surprised at the lack of vintage cars...1 oval window bug, no split =
windows...No 50's busses, ets.....a lot of water-cooled, and great parts =
and swap meet, but serious lack of vintage cars.  Here is their =
reply...........if someone could forward this to the vintage bus and =
vintage vw list that would be great.

&gt; hate to say it but the air cooled cars are fading      we have
&gt; the largest
&gt; of
&gt; &gt; air cooled cars but nobody is building new ones    hate to say it
&gt; and
&gt; &gt; see it         we have not had vintage cars in the 50-60 for
&gt; about 5 years
&gt; &gt;  IM sure that in years to come that the water cooled cars will take =
over
&gt; as
&gt; &gt; nobody wants to put the money in the air cooled cars             =
thanks
