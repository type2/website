Hi folks--

Thanks to all who touched base with me on the engine problem.  Meanwhile
here's an
update:

1. I'm getting the bus back from the $3400-rebuild guys today. FWIW, I
really don't think the guy's a scoundrel; I think he's figured out that
there's a living to be made overcharging people who feel better when
they've overpaid.  And I take Steve's point that sky-high prices can
screen out certain, uhm, nuisance clients.  Doesn't matter, though--
complete lack of ethics or shrewd business plan, I'm getting the bus
today.

2. First move is to get some numbers: How much end play?  What are the
compression numbers?  What are the compression numbers *after* a valve
adjustment?

3. Then . . . well, I don't have a Step 3 yet.  I'm working on that.

best to all

p.s.  There were two points of view about end play: Several said that a
little end play is something you [and your engine] can live with for quite
awhile, but Rick in ID said it would do in an engine before the heads got
a chance to. I'm sure it comes back, in part, to the question of 'how much
is too much?', but this might be a good time to go over the basics.  For
starters, in the archives [Aug 96], Bob Hoover wrote:

&gt; The point I failed to mention in my 'sermons' with regard to end-play 
&gt; is that excessive end-play will cause your timing to 'hunt' by as much
&gt; as ten degrees(!)
