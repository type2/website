Subject: West Virginia Sights and Camping Tips - Thanks

Hi All, 

Thanks for the tips on West Virginia Camping and
sightseeing.  I'll probably end up combining some
interstate with some state routes.  When I was a kid,
I remember going to visit my Aunt Mary in Clarksburg,
WV - always a special treat.  We came down from PA and
of course everything seems bigger when you're a kid,
but I remember big mountains, hairpin 180 degree
curves, and when you got a view of the tops of the
mountains it seemed there was always a devils saddle
in the blue ridges.  I even recall the occassional
wild driver coming around those hairpin curves partly
in your lane.

Rob
