I met the ubiquitous and indefatiguable David Schwarze on Saturday. We 
combed the junkyards in Chula Vista, just missing Karl von Salzen!

Nikki Elko advised me that if I hadn't met David (I hadn't) I was in for 
a treat. She was right.

Also, I want to mention that I have a web page, with almost no Type 2 
content except for the complete account of my trip to Tucson, which I 
serialized on the list here in April:

&lt;http://helix.ucsd_dot_edu/~hineline&gt;

Check out the home page, then click on &quot;Peregrinations of a Field Historian.&quot;
