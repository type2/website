Subject: Battery vs. Alternator

Background: (Sorry for long post)

1978 FI 2.0L Bus Riviera

New Battery Jan 05 (Bus bought by me Jan 05, 3rd owner)



Bus worked great no problems.  Underwent overhaul Oct 05-March 05 replace
all gaskets and other stuff.  Overall goal was to take engine out and see
what needed to replaced and to learn more about VW.  It was snowy out, and I
was not going to drive it anyway.



Fast forward to spring/summer time.

Battery would drain the whole way down and not keep a charge.  Would be able
to get it started and drive 3-40 miles to recharge everything and was good.
Died several times in driveway for not turning over.  Good cranking, just
not catching.  Battery light and EGR light lit up each time.



I replaced:
http://www.ratwell_dot_com/technical/EngineRemoval/12-VoltageRegulator.jpg the
big shiny one.  I have taken the battery back to get charged several  times.
Tire shop (Les Schwab for those in Oregon) says it's the alternator.  It
only died once on me, in town but  I was able to wait 45 mins and everything
cooled down and I got home.  It was in the middle of a 100+ day.  That was
the last straw.



Since then, I get intermittent startings.



There is also a solar panel that charges the battery. (There is only one
battery). But that should not have an affect.  This unit has a charge
indicator on it.  Red-Yellow-Green lights. Meaning what you think that they
do.  Usually it's yellow. Once engine is on, it's green.  When it's red,
it's dead.  However once it turned over.  Panel (when sunny) does provide
some power.  (It's 15watts.  I know it's not much.  I am using it as a
trickle charger device)



When I put a fresh battery (GI Joes version)  , the bus fired right up.  Now
only battery light lites up.  Un-hooked Battery.  This one has more cranking
amps than the former.



In the picture listed above, there is a little black box with a blue arrow
pointed to it what is that?  Is that a LOW VOLTAGE REGULATOR??  What's the
part number?  Would that help?  And should I get an alternator anyway?



(Update)



Drove bus around town for 30 mins. Stopped twice. Second time Bus cranked,
but no spark.  Left in front of friends house.    Reading the Bentley book,
I am thinking, alternator.  I suspect I will have AAA drop it off at my
local mechanics to look at it, plus other small items that need to be done.
