Subject: Throttle adjustment

Hi Folks,
       I have a 77 Westy 2.0 FI and my Haynes manual doesn't cover my 
throttle vavle housing adjustment. The tvh doesn't have a swich or any other wires to 
it.When I adjust the throttle cable (like the book said) the engine would run 
wide open. So I made my own adjustment by having  the throttle vavle open a 
crack and thghten the cable. Is this right?
