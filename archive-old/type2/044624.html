Subject: Re: [T2] Adjusting 32-36 DFAV Weber: Third screw?

I'm a relative newbie to carburation adjustment having just installed dual
Weber 40's, so any and all please comment or correct me...here's how I
understand how to adjust for a too-lean (meaning you're running hot, right
?) problem.  I think the emulsion tubes and jets, in combination, control
the mix ratio of air and fuel and that the adjusting screw controls or
adjusts the amount of that mix.  Running lean means the jets or tubes are
too small,  more or less of the mix they produce won't address the problem.
Take the top off the carb and unscrew the stacks with a dime or stubby
screwdriver. Lift them out without too much banging or the tube/jet will
drop back into the throat of the carb.  Then look for size numbers like F7
or F11 on the emulsion tube and like 115 or 120 or so on the jet itself.
I'm running F11 tubes and 135 jets with a 3/4 turn on the idle screw right
now.  Just returned from my first 3000 mile trip and I got 22 mpg fully
loaded at 70mph for lots of the trip (sometimes ran at 80, but only on 101
in Los Angeles,  the middle finger greeting of the other dribers was just
too distracting at anything slower). I'm interested in how you solve your
problem, please post. Good Luck
