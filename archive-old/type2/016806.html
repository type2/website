         Oh, yes, in that respect, yes -- I can't lift the top with even just
the racks and the empty box up there. Two people can, but it's not worth it.
Easier to pull the racks off. It's a trade-off, I just forget about lifting
the top unless it's a real &quot;camp&quot;. If I'm on the road and just crashing for
the night, I don't bother lifting it anyway, even before I had the rack. And
since I can't live without my sailboards in the summer, I've got to have the
rack. Carrying the boards inside gets old real quick.
