&gt;&gt;check out www.vwcamper.co_dot_uk for a bit more info and a sneak preview of
the
&gt; first issue cover&lt;&lt;
&gt; 
I checked this out a few days ago.  One thing to note is that although the
on-line subscription process will convert the UK currency to your local
currency for you, the order is not secure, so just beware if you want to use
a credit card.  I think the first issue comes to about $6 US airmail to CA.
