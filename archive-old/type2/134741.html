Subject: RE: [T2] Chrome or White Emblem on '73 Standard Bus

&gt; No, all buses had Pastell White L90D emblems (1973 and
&gt; up). Only the Deluxe microbus had a 'chrome' emblem.


FWIW, I've been told that the white ones have gone obsolete again.  Who
knows if this time it's permanent or not. Last time this happened, it was
seven years before I managed to find any again. Of course I'll try other
sources, but it's not looking great. I was told yesterday that my order for
75 of them from Europe has been cancelled.

At the moment I have about a dozen left.
