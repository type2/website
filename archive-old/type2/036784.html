Subject: Clutch cable problem was NOT with the clutch cable...

Listen and learn, brothers and sisters.  In short, first gear wasn't getting
tricky to get into without grinding because the cable was unraveling, it
turned out because the engine was about to fall off.

Once I got under there to take the old cable off, I noticed that 3 of the
four engine bolts were loose, and the fourth (through the starter motor
housing) is gone completely.  Beginners, sheesh.  I snugged everything up
(gotta stop off at Recycled VWs and buy another bolt if they have one, Mid
State Bolt and Screw if they don't) and everything runs great.  I mean those
bolts were LOOSE.  The crack at the bottom of the tranny housing was maybe
1/16&quot; wide.  Live and learn.  I got off very easy.

While I'm at it, what's the easy way to put the clutch pedal end of the
cable on the lever?  Just take it all off the frame and feed from there?

Further, what's the spec on the bolt through the starter housing (pretty
lazy, I'm sorry).  I've got a feeling I'll be in to Mid State soon.

Thanks very much for all the help, anyway.  Who knew?
