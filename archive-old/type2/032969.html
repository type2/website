Subject: Re: [VB] Rust Removal

My favorite tools for rust removal are sand, chemicals, and elbow grease.

I don't think the sacrificial anode thing will work on anything other
than the smallest of parts.

On your rockers, your only choise is to cut them out and replace
them.  On your underbelly,  if you don't have rust perforation, you
can wire wheel it and use POR-15.  On your cargo floors, you'll probably 
end up with a mix of POR-15 and newly sectioned metal.  If the battery tray is
gone, replace it.  The rust stains on the dash can be wiped up with 
CLR, which is available at the hardware store, and is a mild phosphoric 
acid solution.

None of it looks that bad, from the pix.  I say get it running first, seing
as how you have a sotrage issue.
