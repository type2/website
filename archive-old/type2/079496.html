Subject: Re: [T2] black crud coming off my 1970's steering wheel

The black stuff is probably the buildup of grime and skin oils on the
wheel.  It's normal.  Clean it off with a damp cloth, keeping the wheel
damp for an hour or so beforehand.

&gt; Hi, folks:
&gt;
&gt; I could probably let it stand with the subject line, but here's a little
&gt; more detail:
&gt;
&gt; The rainy season has begun in Oregon, and with it, the usual sort of tacky
&gt; surface feel that my steering wheel gets from the moisture. Only this year,
&gt; it's much worse--the stuff is coming off on my hands, big-time. This
&gt; morning, shortly after I'd parked the bus and was walking to the office,
&gt; someone glanced at my hands and asked me if I'd been tarring roofs. It's
&gt; probably the original 1970 steering wheel. Cleaning/scrubbing the gunk off
&gt; simply seems to expose the next layer which becomes tacky in a day or so.
&gt; For that reason, I also figure there's no point in putting on a steering
&gt; wheel cover--even one made from the hide of the finest free-range
&gt; Naugas--until I fix the problem.
&gt;
&gt; I know that part of this is simply about some rubber I need to replace
&gt; around doors and windows, but since that isn't going to happen immediately,
&gt; I'm interested if any listees have already been here and have suggestions
&gt; for how to make the crud go away. Something I can clean it with, treat it
&gt; with, etc.?
&gt;
&gt; thanks
&gt;
