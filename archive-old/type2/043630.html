Subject: Re: locking engine lid latch

One can also use a latch from a 72-79 beetle- the finger part that hangs down 
is just a little longer. What's this about $ 80 latches? That's insane- I'd 
screw gun the thing shut first. As for rekeying, it's not a pin, it's a very 
tiny flathead setscrew- clean the threadlock/ goo out of the head(it has to 
be in the unlocked position to do this- to find it, push down halfway) and 
unscrew it, then put a key of the same blank in and wiggle, it'll pull out.At 
that point. you'll either be able to figure it out, or you'll know someone 
who can switch the wafers for you.   Ed
