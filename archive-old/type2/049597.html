&gt; They are &quot;C&quot; load rating, which is what is specked by VW.  That's 1435 lbs
&gt; per tire, which is enough for a vehicle with a GVW of 5,000 lbs.  A &quot;D&quot;
&gt; rating is around 1700 lbs per tire, and I'm not sure I know of any proper
&gt; fitting tires in the &quot;D&quot; rating, other than the Michelin Agelis 61, which
&gt; doesn't seem to be available this side of the Atlantic.

Wow, 1435 lbs. is LESS than the correct size PASSENGER tire for your bus.
Right now you are looking at the wrong size tire that was recomended for
your bus by VW. If you go to page 51 of the 78 bus owners manual:
http://www.conservatory_dot_com/vw/manuals_nyx/Images/Owner-sManual/78Type2/pg51
.jpg
You will see 2 tires for your bus. Both are 185 14. Not 195/75 14.

A Michelin XSX 185R14C tire has a max load rating of 1710 lbs. I have not
found this tire to be available anymore.

A Michelin XSX 185R14 REINFORCED sidewall has been replaced by the Michelin
MX 185R14 REINFORCED sidewall. It is load rated at 1540 lbs.  You have to
ASK for this tire at your Michelin dealer. It is NOT listed in any Michelin
ad. Tire Rack has them but they do not show them on their website. They do
show them in their paper catalog. About $80.

A Michelin PASSENGER tire, the MX 185R14 which is a non-reinforced sidewall
tire, is rated at 1450 lbs. This is more than the tire load you think you
can get by on. But it is not enough. Your bus will handle like crap and be
all over the road when a truck passes you.



&gt; Note also that Truck tires are loaded at 91% of actually carrying load,
&gt; whereas car tires are rated at 100% of carrying load.  So a &quot;C&quot; rated
truck
&gt; tire, actually has 10% reserve, which is about another 140 lbs capacity.
&gt; Put another way, a truck tire (ie LT) at 1435 lbs capacity is equivelant
to
&gt; a car tire at 1575, approx.

&gt; Reinforced?  Yes, its a 6 ply.  Passenger car tires are 3 or sometime ply.

The 6 ply rating is in the tread. You also need a stronger sidewall.




&gt; Basically the same specs as either:
&gt;
&gt; The Michelin LTX M/S
&gt; http://www.michelin_dot_com/us/eng/tire/catalog/ltxms.htm

This is the WORST example of your group! It is load rated at 92. This is all
of 1389 lbs!!!!!  You need a minimum of between 95 and 96.


&gt; or the Uniroyal Laredo:
&gt; http://www.tirerack_dot_com/tires/Spec.jsp?make=Uniroyal&amp;model=Laredo+AWP

Another tire TOO light in load rating. 1435 lbs. is below a Michelin
passenger car MX 185R14 rated at 1450 lbs.

&gt; The tread, however, looks more like the LTX M/S tread than the Laredo
tread.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Even the beefy Bridgestone Dueler A/T in 195/75R14 is a &quot;C&quot; class tire at
&gt; 1435 lbs per tire.

BEEFY????  It is less than a Michelin MX 185R14 PASSENGER tire rated at 1450
lbs!!!

&gt; Thanks for the feedback.  The tire is made by Uniroyal and, assuming
quality
&gt; and specs are as represented, it is proper size and load rating for VW
vans.

No sir, this is NOT the &quot;proper size and load rating for VW vans&quot;.  Picking
a tire because the tread looks pretty will not get it. But it is YOUR money
and YOUR bus, you can put on whatever you want. Luckily you are in Canada
and I am in Southern California and hopefully your ill-handling bus will not
run me off the road.....
