Subject: Re: [T2] stereo

For car stereos, you can't go wrong with one of the Big Box retailers.

Great prices, and if something does go wrong with the unit, you can  
take it back and raise a stink.

Buying online will net you a great deal as well, but if something is  
wrong with the unit, returns are a hassle.

&gt; Any advice on a good place to buy a CD player for my dash.  I know
