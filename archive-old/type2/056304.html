I have to leave the list for a month as I'm now  heading out on annual
leave.

We are off to Newfoundland from here then home via an unusual Labrador /
Southern Quebec route!


As Arnie says... I'll be back!

By the by we are in our 88 westy for this trip... Moo!   a white 
westy - black bra... very sexy!
