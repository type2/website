&gt; &lt;&lt; WHY did you gap them?  Was the purpose to hammer the seats or
something??
&gt; I curious about that... &gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Mike,
&gt;
&gt; Not sure what you mean by &quot;to hammer the seats&quot;, it isn't mentioned in the
&gt; recent research and work that Boston Engine Exchange has done on hydraulic
&gt; lifters.
&gt;
&gt; My intent is make sure the lifters are fully bled and pumped up before
doing
&gt; the final adjustment.
&gt;
&gt; Here's the link, the article is in his tech section:

&gt; http://www.bostonengine_dot_com/
&gt;
&gt; &gt;From what I have heard and read he is a very highly regarded engine
rebuilder
&gt; in bus and vanagon circles and has done a lot of research that has even
&gt; appeared in Bentley updates.
