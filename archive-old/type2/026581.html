Subject: RE:  76 VW van

&gt;I recently purchased a 76 VW 13 window van.  

Ok, that one threw me for a loop!  But if you count up the individual
window panes in a loaf w/o jalousie windows, I think you do acutally get
13.  Still, though, I've never heard one referred to that way.

&gt;Is there a catalog from someone out there that has lots of parts 
&gt;available so I can restore it.  I'm mainly looking for floor mats 
&gt;and other interior parts.  Also looking for the front emblem.

As to that, there are several choices.  Here are a few of my favorites:

Bus Depot (distributor for WCM and RMMW): http://www.busdepot_dot_com
Sherwood Auto: http://www.oldvolkshome_dot_com/
WestCoastMetric (great, free catalog): http://www.westcoastmetric_dot_com
Wolfsburgwest: http://www.webworldinc_dot_com/wolfsburgwest
Rocky Mountain Motor Works: (800) 258-1996 (no web site, but a great
catalog)

There are, of course, numerous others.  But these will get you started.
