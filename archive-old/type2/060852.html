Subject: defroster fans

Greetings,

Driving through my first winter in the Bus, I see why heaters and
defrosters are a popular topic this time of year. Living in Portland, OR
(moderate, with lots of rain) I'm finding the defroster inadequate. My 74
doesn't have a fan, and is missing the sheet metal under the engine. Was
the fan optional? How much does the missing tin affect the heater? Has
anyone tried the kit advertised by Barney's Import Parts on page 14 of the
current (Dec 98) issue of Hot VW's? (BTW, I found the tech article on
heaters in this issue justified the price, even if it used the Beetle as an
example.) The Bus is my driver and I'd sure like to be able to see. Thanks
in advance.

Still raining, still dreaming (still wiping the glass with a dish towel)
