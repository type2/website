Well, I gotta say, on the one hand, the price is a shocker!  and David is
right, for a parade quality vehicle, it is fine.  OTOH, have you priced a
new mini-van lately????

If you were to say to yourself, &quot;I want a showroom fresh, new VW van,
price is no object&quot;, then I think that you could do much worse than to buy
a low milage original 75-79 van (probable cost, &lt;$4000) and take it to a
good resto shop and ask for the full frame-up resto. They would probably
ask $10-15K, which would give you the van you want for about the price you
would pay for a new mini-van!  If you are on the west coast, it would
probably be much less, but I'm using east-coast off the top of my head
figures here.  Our vans are a bargain!!!!

I have always figured if I spend &lt;$3600/year in maintainance, I am saving
over the cost of new car payments, and (a) I've never come *close* to that
figure! (b) if you walk in to a new car dealer and ask for a new van with
&lt; $300/mo payments, they will laugh!

In theory, there is no difference between theory and practice. 
But, in practice, there is.
