Subject: Mystery switch

I recently purchased a 1970 Westy.  While I was cleaning out the front of the bus I noticed a pull switch of somekind built into the drivers seat pedistal.  Can anyone give a hint as to what this might be?  It looks almost like a manual choke cable, but I have pretty much disproved that idea since this bus has an electric choke.

Thanks,
