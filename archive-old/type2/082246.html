&lt;&lt; Note If you go for the webers the 009 will I think have to be used because 
the webers wont have a vacuum take of point. &gt;&gt;

A vacuum port can be easily installed on an IDF and I have heard that some 
have them (?).  The port should be installed just slightly above the closed 
throttle plate and on the side of the plate that moves up when the throttle 
is opened.  My ghia's is on the left carb because it closer to the dist.  Its 
my understanding that tapping one throat in this manner is sufficient to 
develop the vacuum needed for the correct dual (cent/vacuum) advance dist for 
your bus.

You are significantly limiting the advance your engine needs by running the 
.009 dist.  You can get it to run OK; but if you set it statically you will 
run out of advance at cruising speed and if you set it to correct full 
advance at 3500 rpm, it will be way off for around town driving.

Without a vacuum port, use a .050 dist.  Its advance curve is better suited 
to the type 4 engine than the .009.

Twin webers are nice, but they are tedious to jet correctly and set up, they 
can be high maintenance, they have no chokes, they are very loud and many of 
the kits sold come with very poor quality linkages.
