Subject: Re: [T2] Just picked up my new Bus....

&gt; 	Well, after comming to grips with the fact that I bought a
&gt; Volkswagen.. :) something I thought I'd never do.. heh. I finally got my
&gt; 1973 Volkswagen Bus back home. I've spent the past 2 days working on the car

welcome

&gt; since I've gotten it. Basically.. long story short, the BUS has a brand new
&gt; GEX 1.8 liter engine. The motor has less than 20 miles on it. The BUS also

start saving money NOW for a new engine or rebuild, GEX maybe one of the
worst rebuilders in existance, once in a while they get one right by
accident but 3,000 miles seems to be about average for how long they last,
sorry

&gt; has a COMPLETELY new paint job... sort of a light blue body, with a white
&gt; top (from the dew strip gutter thing to the top is white).

??? wonder how much that is hiding, hopefully nothing
&gt; 
&gt; BUT... the car's been sitting in storage for about 3 years. The car also was
&gt; completely disassembled... nothing was hooked up except the dash... all the
&gt; windows, seats, everything was haphazardly thrown into the back. I spent the
&gt; greater part of yesterday installing the windows and stuff. I had JUST
&gt; enough gaskets to completely reassemble the windows in the front doors, the
&gt; windows / vent on the commando door, and the vent / window on the door
&gt; adjacent to it. All these gaskets were new. Oh yeah, I also was able to
&gt; re-install the defog window in the rear. 
&gt; 
&gt; However, I am completely missing the gasket for the rear passenger side
&gt; window. To make things a little difficult, all four of the big windows had
&gt; the vent option. The brackets and metal that the vent window sit in are
&gt; completely rusted through... definately unrepairable. So that brings me to
&gt; my first question...

replace the rear ones with plain glass windows from a regular (non
deluxe) bus of the same model
&gt; 
&gt; !-) Does anyone on here have for sale a vent window for the rear drivers
&gt; side, and the rear passenger side? I have the glass, but I need everything
&gt; else... from the gasket to the hardware to the brackets.

&gt; The next thing is... I'm trying to replace a lot of the items that look
&gt; &quot;old&quot;. I want to replace all the chrome on the car... I'm thinking of
&gt; getting a whole new set of door locks, and the trunk-hatch door handle, as
&gt; well as the commando door handle.

more important, replace ALL gas lines, with high presure fuel injection
gas hose, THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT

replace the flexible brake lines, I would also replace the brake
pads/shoes

replace ALL fluids including oil/gas/transmission/brake fluid with good
quality new (remember manual transmissions need GL4 oil not the more
common GL5)

&gt; I did find one place on the net.. Wolfsberg West or something... do you guys
&gt; know any other stores that might sell parts for busses?

several folks here on this site own companies, including Bus Depot,
BustedBus, and Old Volks

&gt; Also, not sure what exactly is happening.. but I charged the battery and
&gt; hooked it up. The motor doesn't start. Actually.. it doesn't even crank. The
&gt; headlights and HAZARD lights work. The turn signal lights don't.. and when I

check the ground to the transmission and the wires to the starter

&gt; turn on the hazards.. there's some guage over to the left with an R  -  1/2
&gt; -  1/1  and the needle jumps. What exactly is that guage? R???

gas guage

&gt; What are some things I can check? The motor is brand new... but I'm

the motor is a haphazard assembly of mostly worn out parts, it is very
bluntly a piece of sh*t

but other wise sounds like you have a nice new ride
