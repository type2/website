Subject: Everybus Carabus Help

Hello all,

 

Although I'm going to miss Everybus this year (broken hearted about it), I
would like to make an offer to anyone that may need assistance.

 

I live on MD 301 just north of the VA border in a town called La Plata.
This is south of Waldorf ( a slightly larger town).

 

If anyone is on the way and needs assistance, I have room to park, even camp
if need be, and make repairs.  I am fairly handy with a wrench as well.

 

So, if you find yourself in the area and need a hand, give me a call.

 

And yes, I'm also listed on the AIRS site..  LOL

 

I look forward to seeing all of the trip reports.

 

Dave. 

La Plata Maryland.
