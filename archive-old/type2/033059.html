Subject: coil overs why not gas?

Hi All,
I installed rear coil overs before my 1996 round the country drive and found
them a bit on the bouncy side. Last year replaced them and the front shocks
w/ KYB gas shocks.  Way better IMHO.  Got rid of the bouncy-bouncy and made
this '69 much more sure footed on turns.  Seems like the gas picks up a
little of the sagging suspension.
