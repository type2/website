Subject: Re: [T2] Glisten PC Clearcoat

Jack,
Here's a hint on storing any kindof paint--and especially harner's after
you open them up--
Put them in a refrigerator--
This will keep the paint, and or the hardner from setting up--and will
give you triple the shelf life of the product.

I've mixed Imron--didn't, or couldn't finish up waht I had going--put
the whole gun into the icebox--and it was good to go the next day--cold
air retards the hardening of the paint and hardner--

Now--the humidity thing---

This is a big no-no--with any paint---
Even if i's a hot summer day, wit 99.9% humidity outside--any paint will
turn white-or flatten out--not good--

Having it outside with the dew landing on it was the culprit of your
problems here--besides using the garbage POR product.

Brushing Clear???

Almost impossible to get a nice finish anyway----

Glisten PC Clearcoat 
A not-so-good experience with Glisten PC, a member of the POR 15 family. 
I bought a set of new hub caps and painted them with Glisten PC using an
ordinary brush. Temperature here in VA was 78 degrees. 
First observation: I had opened the can of stuff and activator once
before. Some dripped into the kerf where the top seats. For the smaller
of the two cans, this was enough to seal the top so securely, that I had
to wreck it with vice grips to open it. This stuff is not cheap and I
will get the use of only about half of the liquid I bought. 
Second observation: the product did not flow all that well. I propped
each cap on a brick that I stood end on. So gravity pulled the liquid
from the VW insigna in the middle down to the rims. Some bubbles formed
; many lines formed where the liquid seemed to dry in the few minutes
that elapsed between my swirling it on with the brush and the Glisten
flowing down the hubcap. 
Third, and the worst, observation: I coated them about 10:00 that
morning. I gave two coats as per the label. I left them outside on the
patio that night hoping to give them a good chance to dry. At the end of
the day, the finish was certainly dry to the touch. That night, the
humidity was very high. All windshields were covered with dew. The
mirror finish that was on the hupcaps the night before had changed to a
very matte and very unattractive finish. Permanent. 
Somewhere, I had read that interaction with moisture in the air actually
improves the cure of the POR products. If it did, than my result said
more than that happened. 
I'll probably trash the hub caps and buy a new set. I haven't decided
whether or not to try again with the Glisten. 
Just something to avoid if you use Glisten.
