Subject: I have the Heaviest exhaust of all!

I went out to the 68 DC today to weld up the header where the collector is
(had one pipe crack at the flange) and after blowing 2 holes in the pipe I
got it all buttoned up. Sounds nice, no exhaust leaks. I have a dual quiet
pack on a 1600 Sp and I guess all of that weight took it's toll.
  When I started the bus after it had sat for 2 weeks the throttle stuck
once, the brakes squealed, (rusty disc's on the front) and by the end of the
driveway all was well. I'm constantly amazed at how much fun this bus is to
drive and how many people give me the &quot;thumbs up&quot; while I'm driving. On the
short trip to my friends house to weld up the muffler (less than 1 mile I
had a guy in a Suburban coming head on lean out his window and wave as he
went by, and a Soccer mom with a load of kids in the Minivan pull up next to
me and one of the kids said &quot;that's phat man&quot; (I'm too old to know what that
means but he was smiling when he said it so I took it as good).
Drive em people, that's what they were built for.
