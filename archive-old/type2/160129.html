Yeah, I know.  On the other hand, if they were absolutely *horrible*,
someone would bitched all over the place about 'em by now.

I've seen a few AA sets in person -- Kona Fleming from Nampa, ID
had a booth at the Woodburn swap last year.  The materials and
machining quality looked comparable if not marginally better than
most of the Cofap sets I've worked with .. though since I haven't
built an engine with the AA's yet, I really can't say.  Maybe next
year when I finally get to build a new engine for the Fastback.
