Subject: How to make out the check?
Mime-Version: 1.0

Hello Ted................I'm sitting here with the checkbook open and pen 
in hand.  Do I make the check payable to &quot;Ted Finesman&quot;?  Or, &quot;Type2 
Fundraiser&quot; ? or.........does it matter? Things like that are important to 
us check writers. Loose ends and all that.

Somebody else asked the same question on the list, and I didn't see an 
answer. Maybe I missed it.

You were real clear about where to send it and why.

Let's do this thing.

Doyt Echelberger
