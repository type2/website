 Susan
 best bet would be to drain it and replace it with GL-4
 the additives in GL5 will shorten the live of your syncros.
 Sta-Lube still makes a straight GL4 gear oil.

&gt; &gt; i found pennzoil gearplus 80w-140 and on the back it says  &quot;exceeds
&gt; requirements of
&gt; &gt; the manufacturers requiring gl-5&quot;.
&gt; &gt; should they be drained and start all over?
&gt; &gt; should i throw away the gl-5 compatible?
