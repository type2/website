&gt; I know we all love to pontificate about the amazing abilities of

&gt; I wonder if the splitty groups have people advocating tubed tires 
&gt; since that's what the engineers specified in 1950 :-)

Hi all,

This is an excellent point.  The Germans have a well deserved 
reputation for engineering excellence (One of my Dutch friends told me 
that in heaven the designers are Italian, the engineers are German and 
the police are British) but technology does change (usually for the 
better) over time.  For example, the 2004 Eurovan (with a curb weight 
of 4288 pounds) comes standard with 225/60 R16 tires (passenger car 
tires.... with load rating 97).

I have a '76 Westy with KYB gas (nitrogen) filled shocks and 215/65 R15 
tires.  It handles much more predictably (safer) and rides FAR better 
than it did with the original tires and shocks that were available to 
the designers in 1976.  If you want to keep your bus stock for 
sentimental or show reasons, that's wonderful but we need not become 
&quot;Ludites&quot; about improved technologies.

Peace,
Jeff
