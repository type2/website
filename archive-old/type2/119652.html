Subject: Idling problems

My 78 f.i. westy suddenly and without warning developed an inability to idle
at all.  Just put in Pertronix ignitor,  Bus stats well and runs well but
will not idle.  This morning after about a 20 minute drive to work it came
closer to holding an idle but not quite.  When started from cold (about 50
degrees this morning) it dies instantly when the accelerator is lifted.  The
air bypass idle speed control on the airbox has no effect.  Does anyone have
any suggestions as to the first things to check. As I said this happened
without warning after taking the bus to have new tires installed.  It went
fine but on return would not idle.

Thanks for any suggestions.
