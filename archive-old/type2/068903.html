Subject: No spark

I am just getting the motor in my '74 back in, it should be done on
Sunday, and have a question.  Right before I pulled the motor, it lost
its spark.  There seems to be no current at the coil (I tested it with a
voltmeter on the positive lead).

Could the regulator cause this?  I've never owned a car with a regulator,
so I don't know what exactly they do.  Or, is the silver thing on the
passenger side firewall that has all the wires on it really a regulator?

I've checked all the other easy solutions (coil, points, etc) and am a
little stumped.  I pulled the motor to replace the heads, so the lack of
spark wasn't the #1 priority, but no I need to face it.
