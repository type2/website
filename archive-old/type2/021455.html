Grant, Bob, list:
This is one of those places where an ounce of prevention is worth a couple of
pounds of cure. Shoulda put the torch on the nut and saved the stud!
Having said that, you can still heat the aluminum with a torch and use a vise
grips, preferbly a NEW one with very sharp teeth. If this fails, use a dremel
and a cut-off wheel and cut it off and drill it out and tap it or drill and tap
oversize. This is getting into the realm of THINGS RATHER DONE WHILE THE HEAD IS
ON THE BENCH, so choose your battles carefully.

&gt; &gt;Tell me a quick and easy way to get out one of the bolts that I broke off
&gt; trying to put back on  my muffler.  I have about 2-3 inches of the bolt
&gt; left, vice grips don't seem to work.
&gt; &gt;Thanks, Bob

&gt; Bob, MIG weld a nut to the bolt stub.
