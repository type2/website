Hello All   We rised $114.00 from the raffles at Naturalbus for the Type2 
list also same amount for Juvinile diabetes. hopefully this will start a 
trend of other campouts doing the same, helping to support the list that we 
all use. There also was a donation for the Fullmoonbusclub I don't know the 
amount.     also to those that missed Naturalbus you not only missed the best 
campout of the year you also missed getting to give to these good causes.
