&gt; I have a new engine with 3000 miles. I use 40wt. castrol.That was what the
&gt; builder sugested. 40wt from memorial day to halloween then 30wt from
&gt; then back to mem.day. Does anyone think synthetic woild be better?

More expensive, and there are issues with synthetics being less capable of
carrying off heat than conventional mineral oils.
