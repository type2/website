Your can use a hammer or very large pair of pliers on the flanges where the 
pipe mates with other pipes.

I recommend cleaning them and painting them with high temp paint. It won't 
last forever but it's a start. Use the brush on type. The spray type 
doesn't seem to get enough paint on (too thin) without many re coats and it 
tends to burn off quickly when the paint is thin.

The broken exhaust stud will be a challenge. Try alot of penetrating oil 
over a period of days. Might talk to a friendly machinist and see what 
advice he offers.

I drilled out several of my broken exhaust studs (carefully) only to have 
them pull out again. I then had to pull and tap the holes for small block 
Chevy exhaust manifold studs (larger diameter and very coarse threads). 
Several years and many thousands of miles later - all is well.

I recommend that you take a long wide file for metal and file the pipe to 
head surfaces. File them together at the same time in long strokes. This 
will bring them into the same plane again as the pipes tend to warp with 
age. I had an exhaust leak right there. File until the mating surface is 
shiny on both pipes which will indicate that they are now in the same plane 
(the warp or twist is gone).

Install new gaskets between the pipes and the heads - the little copper rings.

Finally you might take a pipe to your FLAPS and buy your pipe to pipe 
gaskets from them IF you don't order all of the exhaust gaskets from 
somewhere else (mail order).

There are several exhaust gaskets for Japanese vehicles that will fit with 
only a little alteration of the bolt holes.

They seem to stand up to time better - at least they have for me. Ask your 
FLAPS parts man to let you browse through their gasket box.

If you have to replace heaters or muffler I suggest that retro fit the 
early Type IV bus heaters and exhaust ('72 thru '74). Simpler design, less 
pipe hanging out in the wind to cool down before entering the heater boxes.

The list can advise you of the conversion parts.
