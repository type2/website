Subject: RE: valve cover leaks

-David said: I tried everything I could think of and eventually had 
to resort to silicone sealant.  Finally stopped the leak though.


In a 71 bus that I used to own, the PO had hooked up the smog hoses
wrong so that the air from the cooling fan was actually pumping air
into the crankcase. I fought valve-cover leaks for over a month
until I realized the problem. Make sure that the hose from the
fan goes to the carbon canister--not to the connection below the
oil filler cap.

BTW, the bus passed smog inspection with the hoses hooked up wrong!
