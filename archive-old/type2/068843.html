Subject: Re: pickups $1000/pair!

&gt;Called but got message machine - don't know if they're still there, but in
&gt;the Dallas Morning News this morning:
&gt;
&gt;2 1959 single cab p/u, both compl.  1 no eng.  no titles  $1000/pair
&gt;817-484-5526
&gt;
&gt;Also,
&gt;'65VW Split Window bus  runs good $1500  972-298-1507  (Dallas suburb)
I've called this gentleman before... one pickup looks alright, is
restorable; the other is a cancer victim. No, I don't remember which. I
offered him $600 for both a month ago. They are NOT complete, missing
windows, lights, seats, dash items, etc.  And NO TITLE in Texas means PAIN
IN THE ASS. I was told you have to take the car you just *bought* to a
sheriff's auction (after its been declared abandoned) and BID on the
sucker... and you may LOSE. There might be a simpler way, but that's what
the drone at DPS told me...  This kid sent me photos, apparently the man
*he* bought them from has something like 30 VWs and trucks, tractors, etc
laying around, all in wretched shape. If David S. would like to check these
p/ups personally, and can weasel the weasel down to a reasonable price, I'd
be happy to go in on them for parts, at least.
