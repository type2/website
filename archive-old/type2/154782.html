Subject: Bus Depot Search Engine

&gt; I dont seem to have any problems with busdepot searches.
&gt; i selected bus/72-79 and entered shifter plate and got
&gt; nothing. tried shift plate and got it and a quick shift and one other.
&gt;
&gt; you can also enter text in the part number search although it
&gt; doesnt say so.


This issue comes up time to time, and I think it's because our search engine
is a bit different from most. Our &quot;smart&quot; context-sensitive search function
is powerful but can be confusing if you don't understand how it works.  Also
the two search boxes on our site serve very different purposes.

The search boxes on the main (white) pages are context-sensitive. This means
that on each page, the search box only searches within the vehicle and/or
part category that is shown above that search box. For example, if you go to
&quot;68-71 Bus&quot; and then search from the main (white) page, it will search
within all parts for a 68-71 Bus. But if you go to [ 68-71 Bus &gt; Brakes ],
the same search box will now search only Brake parts for that vehicle.  If
you go one step further down, to [ 68-71 Bus &gt; Brakes &gt; Front Wheel
Hydraulics ], now the search box below it only searches within that
subcategory. And so on. This means that you can drill down as far as you
want to into the catalog, and then search from there.

If you don't get a search result, you may want to go back to to the top
level of the drilldown (i.e. 68-71 bus, with no part type chosen), so it
searches all part categories for your model. You can go up one or more
levels by clicking on any part of the drilldown that is shown.  For example,
if the top of the page says [ 68-71 Bus &gt; Brakes &gt; Front Wheel Hydraulics ],
each of those is a link. Click on [ Brakes ] to go up one level (to all
Brake parts), or click on [ 68-71 Bus ] to go up two levels (back to the
master listing of all 68-71 Bus part types). Have I confused you yet? :-)

The search box in the yellow menu bar (to the left of every page on the
site) searches the entire catalog at once. As Andy pointed out, this box
will search by either part number or description, even though it's labeled
as a part number search. But searching here by description is sometimes of
limited value because it doesn't limit the search to part that fit your
vehicle (as the main-page search box does).  Therefore, this search box is
usually better for part number searches, if you know what part number you're
looking for.  Incidentally, this search box also does some
cross-referencing, so if you search one part number and it brings up a
totally different number, read the description. The search engine probably
found a superceded part number and is displaying the new number
automatically.

Of course, choose your search criteria carefully for best results. For
example, on a keyword search, avoid plurals (like &quot;brake pads&quot;). Searching
&quot;brake pad&quot; (singular) will give you both &quot;brake pad&quot; and &quot;brake pads,&quot; but
searching &quot;brake pads&quot; will only give you the latter.  On a part number
search, it's best to leave off any letters on the end of the part number, as
the part numbers often get superceded. So if you are looking for part
211611047D, but we call it 211611047F, you'll get no hits (or maybe you'll
get an older &quot;D&quot; version of the part, whereas we have a later version
cheaper that didn't come up). But if you search for plain 211611047 (no
letter), the D, the F, and perhaps others will come up, and you can then
read the application info and make your choice.

I hope I'm explaining this well. It's all makes perfect sense to me, because
I'm the one who designed it. :-)
