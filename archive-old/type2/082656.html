Subject: Need T4 Engine inCO

Hi all,
I need a complete running type 4 engine in Colorado
for my 74 Westy. Does not have to be perfect. Just
needs to be able to pass CO emissions and last about
10k more mile. Solex carbs preferred but not required.
I really need this engine because the T! that is
crammed in there is ready to blow up. 
Thanks,
Tyler
