I would try two methods. One is to heat the bolt with a propane torch.
After red hot give it a try. If this is still stubborn, heat it again, and
apply wax yes candle wax, it will get in there and help.

The other is to try a penentrating oil made by GM. This is the best I have
ever used. Ask a GM mechanic dealership for the stuff and where to find it.
