&gt; There's nothing wrong with 1, 2, 3, or whatever shims. Many engines use NO
&gt; shims, relying only on good tolerances from the bearing and crank. I have
&gt; built many engines, and used to use ONE shim at the correct thickness to
&gt; achieve the proper end-play. Just make sure they aren't worn out, they tend
&gt; to warp and are difficult to measure their actual thickness like that.

I agree that one shim is the ideal.  Porsche seems to back this up.

However, most folks use three as VW intended.  When making up your shim
stack, it is best to use two thick and one thin shim if you have the
option.  Put the thin shim in the middle.  the thick shims aren't as prome
to being &quot;dished&quot; when cluch throwout pressure traps them between the
flywheel and main bearing.  The &quot;dish&quot; doesn't hurt the end play
adjustment while the shims are in place, but it will cause untold
headaches if the dished shim ends up in the middle of a future shim stack!

I also have a theory that you can reduce wear in this area by avoiding
starting the vehicle with the clutch depressed.  When you depress the
clutch with the engine stationary it squeezes the oil out from in between
the shim and main bearing, and it may be that dynamic oiling doesn't start
until oil pressure is available at the main.

With my new engine I'm starting it in neutral with the clutch engaged.
I'll let you know in 100K miles or so if my theory is correct!  :)
