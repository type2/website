Hi all,
    All this talk about dual chargers got me to thinking...... Ouch, I
though I finished that in school.  Just kidding.  Anyways, most marine
supply outfits carry an item called an automatic battery charger.  It is a
little costly, but works very well.  I use one not in the bus, but on my
boat and it charges both of my deep cycle batteries indepent of the starting
battery.  One wire is ran to the smart charger, which outputs 10 amps to
both batteries.  Simple install, works great on my boat, and is really cool
looking with the blinking leds.  My question is can this be used in a bus??
Seems to me that a self contained smart charger that regulates amperage to
the accessory batteries would solve all the issues concerning which relay
system to use for saftey reasons.  Marine suppliers have these in all
variety, from small for one battery to gigantic for banks of deep cycles.
Added bonus, there is no current drawn from the starting battery, and the
charger automatically shuts down the current after you pass a set amperage.

Word,
