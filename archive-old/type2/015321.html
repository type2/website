&gt;Weeeell.  I have to dissagree here, at least to some extent.

Some good ideas, David. My comments follow.
&gt;
&gt;Perhaps years ago, when all Bosch parts were equal, this may have been
&gt;true.  Today, in a world of &quot;distrubuted economics&quot;, on the other hand,
&gt;parts .fail.  For no reason. 

I agree up to the point of &quot;no reason&quot;. There is always a reason for 
the failure. Noting a failed part and replacing it is not resolving
the issue. WHY it failed must be addressed if a subsequent failure is
to be avoided. I avoid the &quot;Bosch&quot; parts manufactured in other than
Germany because I have noted poor quality or have not yet been convinced
of their adequacy by OTHER PEOPLES EXPERIMENTS.

 Bosch spark plugs, for instance, will leave
&gt;you with the option of driving home on 3(or less!) cylinders, or roadside
&gt;replacement with your spare parts, or locally optained new parts.  There
&gt;are numerous documented cases of these plug wires failing well before
&gt;their expected interval, and without warning.  They will be fine one day,
&gt;the next you'll wonder why you dont idle.

This just has not been my experience. Of the thousands of Bosch ignition parts
I install every year, I recall two problems. A big six BMW that had heavy
deposits at about half the expected life. Reason, the owner had been adding
the cheapest FI cleaner he could find with every tankful. I had mentioned to
him earlier that a quality detergent every third or forth tankful could
help keep the system clean because I knew he was using the cheapest gas he
could find
which left no margin for a good detergent package in the fuel.

The other problem was with a Volvo. No start one morning and towed to the
shop.
This is on a vehicle that is up on the maintenance. Problem was the ignition
module. Replaced it. Several weeks later, complaint of occassional dieing
at stop signs and it didn't seem to start right off like it used to.

Investigation reveals the carbon contact in the distributor is toasted.
Cap and rotor had some 10,000 miles on them and usually 20k is not a strain.
Called the Bosch Technical Hot line. Provided the facts. Reason, yes, says the
engineer, the problem is the failed ignition module. When they begin to
go they will create high resistance in the secondary and the carbon 
overheats. 


&gt;
&gt;Rotors, caps, and points are no different.  a few weeks ago i had a 3 week
&gt;old bosch rotor self destruct (proper rotor, proper cap). Chncks went
&gt;everywhere.  I've had caps crack, or even break in two. 

Not once in the last ten years, except if not installed properly. Some of
those rotors and caps are cut so close to spec that real tenacity is involved
to get them to seat firmly. I have had these probs with Standard brand.
Cracked right out of the box. I was helping a Mercedes client with his
Mitsubish cause I could't scare him to another shop.

 Points that have
&gt;their rider block shear off, etc.  all well before their schedualed
&gt;maintance period.

Not once have I seen this. The only rider block probs have been associated
with LOM squared or no lubricant ie, improper installation and/or maintenance.

&gt;
&gt;There are many similar stories from other listees as well.  I've also
&gt;found that the &quot;generic&quot; Wells products tend to have a longer life then
&gt;their Bosch counterparts.

As they are not specified by the manufactures I service, the only experience
I have with them is replacing them with specified parts. As I have stated
elsewhere, I don't experiment with my or my clients vehicles.

&gt;Fan belts are no different.  A visual inspection the day before may not
&gt;show you the chunk that breaks loose the next day on your way to work.

Try Continental. And inpect those pullies for burrs, wear and alingment.

I always carry tools and spares if I'm journeing out of town some distance.
Don't need many parts cause I rarely jouney to places where no parts are
available. I do keep in my Porsche spare belt and pulley halves, but could
obtain them overnight from my regular supplier. 

I say it again.
The Deutscshes Methode will set you free, reduce your cost per
mile, protect you from perils, and improve your life.

&gt;Alas, in america we also have the ageold entity known as &quot;Murphy.&quot;

Yes, he's always waiting around to pounce on ANY compromise or error 
we might make. He has so little opportunity in Germany that he can't
get a firm purchase there.

&gt;so.. Carry those spares and those tools.  Just dont put off that regular
&gt;maintenance and inspection.

No argument. Until the DM is studied and practiced for many years and 
become rote habit, they are needed for reassurance and stop gap to
bridge the learning process.

Thank you for the feedback.
