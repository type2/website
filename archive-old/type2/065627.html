Full lenght , 3/4 or little? Front or rear? Yes - there are places - but if you
want original westfalia then save yer pennies and join the queue of hopeful
hunters.
Karmann Konnection do nice repros...as do other people...write to me direct if
you want details..some nice looking wood slat racks are available, some even
copy the westfalia design....currently SSVC is looking into commissioning these
but we can put you in contact with sources!
