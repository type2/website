&gt; Mmmm, bloody VW fuel injection!
&gt; Most mechanics I've spoken to give it the heave ho
&gt; pretty early on &amp; 2 of my good friends dumped it for
&gt; carbs: 1 got Webers &amp; the other standard Solexs.
&gt; I think the general consensus here in Australia is
&gt; that fuel injection was something that VW got wrong.
&gt; :-)

Having nearly been stranded in Dillon last winter, I'm fairly sure our
friend is suffering from the effects of being at 10,000 ft and having a
vehicle
that is tuned for sea level.

The head temp sensor, even if it's connected, will lenghten out the
pulse in cold
weather to the point where the engine will flood. Being as that it
snowed yesterday,
it's cold, and the plugs are going to stay fouled.

My guess is that he needs new spark plugs, and would benefit greatly
from bypassing
the head temp sensor by grounding it.  He should also pop the top of his
AFM, use
some white out to mark where the geared wheel is presently located, and
using two
screwdrivers, one to hold the release, and the other to spin the wheel,
adjust it so
that the spring tension is increased. About 6-8 notches tighter would be
a good place
to start.

Outside of Denver, put the AFM back to where it was.
