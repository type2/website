Subject: Re: [T2] Prices for a valve job?

 scott lyons &lt;slyons_at_germansupply_dot_com&gt; Said:
 
&gt; You will also probably see a trend that more of the dropped valves are in
&gt; injected buses than carbed, and of the carbed buses, the 1.7 drops more than
&gt; the 1.8.
 
Scott
Why do you suppose this is so? Have you actually seen more 1700s than 1800s with dropped valve seats? Or is this just an assumption based on the assumption that the 1700 will be flogged a little harder than the 1800 to keep up with traffic?
