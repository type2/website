Subject: re: trans won't shift

&gt;In the meantime, I bought a rebuilt trans (from the infamous Todd Hill, no
&gt;less) and mounted it in the bus, waiting for the magic day.  Two weeks ago,
&gt;I sat in the driver's seat and fantisized about driving again. I pushed the
&gt;stick around but could not move it into any of the gear positions.

One possibility is that the transmission was in gear and the nose cone, and
internal shift linkage, was installed in neutral.  This results in a
condition kinda like you describe.  Check to see if the trans is already in
a gear by turning the input shaft by hand while checking if the stub shafts
turn.  You need to hold the stub shafts because friction will sometimes
cause them to turn a little.  I know this requires about five hands but if
it is in gear then you'll need to remove the nose cone and pop the rails
back into neutral.  Much easier with the engine out!  Sometimes you can do
it through the filler plug hole, it depends on what gear it's in.
