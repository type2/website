I seem to recall that, back when I was just beginning to look around for
my first bus (say, around 1993), I saw an article, or at least a
captioned photo, of a motorcycle powered by a type IV engine in one of
the VW magazines.  I didn't think it was particularly odd at the time;
but haven't heard or seen anything about VW powered two-wheel
transportation since.  Do any of you listees out there have your spare
bus engine sitting between two wheels?
