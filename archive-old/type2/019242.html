Hello All,

I have a 77 2l FI van with a similar flywheel problem.  There is a
groove in the outside of the flywheel hub (non-clutch side) worn from
the crank seal.  The groove is rather irregular and varied in depth (up
to maybe 1/4 mm).  It is from wear and not a machined in channel.  There
were no leaks from the front end of the case, even with this scoring.  I
imagine over time, there may be leaks, or at least the seals will wear
out faster.

I have a question about the o-ring.  On the inside diameter of the
flywheel hub there is a machined groove.  Does anyone know if there is
supposed to be a seal there.  I have a gasket set with an o-ring for the
flywheel that is too large for this location and too small for the
outside diameter of the hub (still all non-clutch side).  Am I correct
in assuming I have a non-stepped crank and flywheel and I do not need
the o-ring at all?  The cross section of the (non-clutch side) flywheel
hub goes straight out from the 5-bolt section to where the bearing
thrust surface is.  On top, the surface curves outwards as it goes away
from the centre.  The crank end is a straight cylinder back from the
bearing with a rounded end that fits into the flywheel hub.

          (Flywheel slopes away smoothly on top)

      What is this groove for?
