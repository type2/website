Hey folks, just thought I'd pipe in here.

Up here in the great white north (Canada), there are quite a few hills as well.
We live in Vancouver, BC and I've been driving for 25 years and in all that
time, I, nor many of the people who I've been a passenger with, have used the
handbrake method of driving with a standard. on a hill.  I actually tried it
when we first got our busses and frankly, it's more hassle than it's worth.
It takes more effort to do all that is necessary to do a handbrake start  than
to simply release the clutch until it noticeably starts grabbing ,
then quickly slide the foot off the brake pedal and on to the accelerator while
letting the clutch out and pressing on the gas pedal like a normal take off.
Done corectly, you will maby roll back 2 feet and even less as you get more
experienced.  The fear of rolling backwards into the other car and of stalling
at an intersection and hearing 20 horns beeping at &quot;some hippie in a VW Bus&quot; is
why most people have a fear of hill starts.  Do as the other listees have
suggested, practice where it's not going to affect traffic.  Like any motor
skill / coordination skill, this takes practice, and with time, is second
nature.  This has always worked for me and the ones I know who started with the
park brake take off did exactly that;  started, and then they switched to the
standard take off I just described.  You can do this with a properly operating
bus on any hill.  We've got some good hills here in Vancouver.
