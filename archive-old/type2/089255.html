Subject: Re: [T2] leak  down again


&gt; In thinking about this, I don't see what difference it makes. Should
&gt; not leakage past the rings or past the valves happen regardless of
&gt; where the piston sits?

There is very little cylinder wear at the bottom of the stroke.
On a gas engine, cylinder wear is always at the top of the ring travel. The
rings will wear the wall enough to form a ridge. On cars with a solid block,
you sometimes need a ridge reamer to get the pistons out. The ridge reamer
cuts down the wall.
