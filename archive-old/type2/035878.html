Thanks for the pictures! Your cabinet is *totally*
different than the one in my '69 Westy SO-67!!! My
table is not as long as yours and rests on a
swing-away wire bracket...my drawer (it's a real
drawer that pulls out) is only about 4&quot; wide....my
cabinet has no metal trim....different basin...no
drain...no plastic vent-shaft... Like I said, totally
different!

I enjoyed seeing the jump-seat, too! Mine is long gone
and I'd never seen one before. Anyone have one for
sale???!

And no, I don't have, nor have I ever seen/heard of
the cushion that fits in the tire well. Pretty
cool....I may have to make myself one!
