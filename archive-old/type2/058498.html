   I'm a new van owner surrounded by bug racers. They all race large motored
bugs and buggies. Now heres my problem they are all trying to get me to
install a 1776? motor in the bus. I have a solid stock 1600 that I was just
going to overhaul into a 1650. Now my question is which would be better for a
everyday to work and beach hopefully low maitnence bus. Thank you for any help
or advice.
