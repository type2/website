Subject: Air cleaner

Wish I had that one!  Oil bath cleaners are MUCH MORE efficient
cleaners...just a LOT messier to clean/service!   I have a 1942 Ford
tractor with one.  It has spent its life in DUSTY fields, and still
does!  A few years ago I had occasion to open things, and found the
engine in excellent shape: rings &amp; bearings good, valves good, etc.  If
you'd like to get rid of that (maybe) bug aircleaner.....

Subject: Odd engine config and brake woes....

Friends,
I've seen plenty of T2 engine configs, from barndoors to '79's, but
never
one like mine.  I don't even know where the cleaner came from.  I
recently
purchased my '72 Westy from a dude in Jacksonville, Fl, about 6 hours
away.
The engine is a Type-4 FI (obviously not original).  The odd thing is
the
air cleaner:  It is an oil bath (round) mounted to brackets suspending
it
above the center of the case.  the air is going in one SIDE and out the
opposite SIDE, where it connects to a normal-looking airflow-sensor
setup
and then back under the cleaner to the intake manifold.  There is no aux

heater blower (the cleaner is in that general space) and the heater box
openings are loosely covered by aluminum foil.

I haven't really messed with the cleaner too much as I want to know more

before making a damn mess with the oil-bath (yes, I hated the one on my
Bug)
Does ANYBODY know where this set-up came from????  Is this not as
effective
as the paper-element setup?

Also- After having the master cylinder, brake lines, and the rear
cylinders
replaced, my brakes seem to work fine.  However, when I have to press
hard,
the brake warning light shines.  I know the fluid is good, I can't find
any
leaks, what gives???

Thanks again,
Wade
