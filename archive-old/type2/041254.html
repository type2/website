Subject: more solenoid problems..

ok, i put the relay on there., and it worked at first, it started pretty
nicely, .but after i got down there and secured it, it didn't work
anymore! maybe not enough voltage in the relay? i told them i needed a
generic 30
watt headlight relay., but i don't think that's what they gave me. he
looked pretty confused, and grabbed the first thing he saw on the shelf,
and told me it was the right one.
i think he jus gave me one without enough watts. any advice? , oh yeah!!
when it stopped working my idiot lights didn't dim anymore! but then
when i took it off, they
dimmed again. it only dims a little when i turn the key.
my battery is fine. 12 volts on the voltmeter. help!
