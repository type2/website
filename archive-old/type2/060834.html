Does anyone know where I can find Jets for this Carb??  I have called around
to local FLAPS and everyone tells me good luck.  I am having an over heating
problem on my new rebuild 1776 and think that the problem is in the jetting.
Spark plugs are white grayish color.  I would like to find a different
assortment of jets to try.  Once I have the Jets reamed out I can not go back
so I would like to have some back up.  I thought that someone said that you
could find jets from a motorcyle dealer but am not sure which one it was.
