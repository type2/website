sorry, 

what are signs of the clutch going out?i can rev up the bus in 4th gear , 
seems like the clutch is slipping... what is involved in redoing the clutch? 
what parts are needed, is this almost imposibble or could i do it?

also i am wondering if i have a pcv valve..i have a 72 with cali. emmision's.
there is a black box right in the center up top of the engine that loots like 
a 'teapot'
when running, there is air coming out of it, nothing is hooked up to that 
right now and i am wondering if i should route a hose up to the intake..or is 
it not worth it...?

thanks
Adam
