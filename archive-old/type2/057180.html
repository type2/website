I just took out my 78 2.0 engine to see why I had no compression in the #1
cylinder.  It turned out to be a burnt valve.  However I also noticed the #2
cylinder was leaking where it meets the head.  Closer inspection revealed a
crack in the cylinder at the flange where it meets the head.  I now need a new
piston and cylinder.  I don't have enough money to buy a whole set.  Does
anyone know where I can get a hold of a single piston and cylinder 94mm.  I
would take a used one, but would prefer new.  I am desperate, the wife is
loosing patience with the bus right now.  I need to get this back together
ASAP.

Thanks, Graham
