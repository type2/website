Subject: no spark stilll part 2



Thanks for everyones help so far, but stillno workie.  I was thinking 
though... i was wondering if possibly i ruined my brand new coil since the 
points were pretty tight and i didn't adjust them until after installing the 
new coil.   I don't want to buy another one unless i have to since i just 
bouught one 2 days ago... does anyone know if i could have ruined the new 
one and if there are any other ways to test only the coil?

thanks
