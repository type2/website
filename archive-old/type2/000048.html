Hi David!

I have a 1973 1800cc Pancake engine in my 1973 camper bus, and I set all
my valves to .006, and the work just great.

On your year as well, intake and exhaust valves should be set the same,
at .006.   There is good instruction about how to do this in the Idiot's
manual by John Muir.

I asked a lot of folks as well before I set my valves, and although I
got a few different answers overwhelmingly, most folks agreed on .006

Good luck!

Volks,

I have a 72 pancake that I have rebuilt and am adjusting valves , I have
new 
heads and went to 1800 P &amp; Cs what do I set valves at? my manual said
.006 or 
..oo8 depending on which valves I have and I dont have a clue like most
other 
things to this point. Also are all the valves to be set at the same or
do the 
intake and exhaust have different settings,

   THankyou,
    David
