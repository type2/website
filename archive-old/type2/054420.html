Rule of thumb on the compression:  100 or above is good.. If it's running,
make sure it has oil in it, and drive it home.
 Give it your best ( &quot;YOU CAN DO IT YOURSELF&quot;) on the electrical. As someone
told me recently, on some challenging electrical work I needed to do on a
bus ( replaced the main wiring harness ),&quot; It's a piceocake if you take your
time, use the books, library, archives and the positive information and
experience of the listees.

&gt; Well, I just came back from the shop that has my Westy. They managed to
get
&gt; the engine running. He said he pulled the plugs, did a compression test,
and
&gt; then the engine turned okay. He said he thinks some carbon or something
must
&gt; have gotten in. The good news is, it's running.
&gt;
&gt; The bad news is, the compression is not good: 100-135-135-100. Also, it's
&gt; leaking oil bad on one side--he said the push rod tubes need to be
replaced
&gt; (the PO had just finished doing one side but didn't get to the other).
And,
&gt; there is a problem with the ignition wiring. The black wire on the left
side
&gt; of the engine that I guess is supposed to go to the coil is not connected
and
&gt; looks melted. He said that will need to be looked into if the bus is ever
to
&gt; start without a separate wire hooked from the coil to the pos. terminal on
&gt; the battery.
&gt;
&gt; So what do I do now? He's working up a price on a rebuild, I told him I
might
&gt; just drive it home. Would it make the drive home w/low compression? It's
only
&gt; about 10 miles, but there are some big hills to go up, unless I go the
long
&gt; way.
&gt;
&gt; Well, many thanks to all of you. I'm overwhelmed by the number of
responses
&gt; I've gotten and also at just how much everyone knows. I hope one day I'll
&gt; know as much and can help someone new like myself.
