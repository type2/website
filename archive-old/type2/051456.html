Subject: [T2] Fuel Hoses for 2.0 FI '78 Westy


&gt; I've been consulting the www.type2_dot_com site lately while working on my
poptop.  I've gotten the message about replacing the fuel hoses for my fuel
injection.
&gt;
&gt; I'm not an experienced mechanic, but I got under the bus today to trace
the fuel line and see what it would take to do the job.  It looks like I
have a metal line from the gas tank that attaches to a 7mm hose to the fuel
filter, then 12mm (?) hose from the opposite side of the filter back to
metal line.  The metal line continues into the engine compartment, then to a
junction near the manifold.  The outlet of the junction also appears to be a
metal line.  Does this sound correct?

&gt; If this is correct, it looks like I only need about 4 inches of 7mm hose
and maybe 8 inches of the larger hose.  I can't imagine that almost all of
it is metal, but could this be correct on the '78 Westies???

4&quot;???   No, closer to 4 feet! It goes from the tank to the pump, then from
the filter to the left injector rail then to the cold start valve then from
the cold start valve to the right rail then to the pressure regulator then
back to the tank plus you have all 4 injectors. The hose you want is 7.5mm
fuel injection hose. NOT regular fuel hose. The best I've found is Mercedes
hose, part # 916030-000527. It lists for $11 a meter.
