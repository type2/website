Subject: Re: [T2] Wipers and washing Westy interior

Tide,, with a quarter cup Cascade, fabric soften to taste, cold water,
gentle cycle, hang damp dry, and install back on the foam to finish dry.

Tide in a bucket of hot water works good for carpet cleaner.
Scrub, rinse with clear water and a turkish towel.



Later,


Terry

List,

Westy interior: someone mentioned a while ago that he washed his Westy
matress and bench covers successfully. What kind of detergent did you
use? Which temperature? The last time I cleaned Westy covers I took them
to a specialty dry cleaner - and that was neither cheap nor did I like
the dry cleaner smell. What makes a good Westy carpet cleaner (that does
not take out the original color)?
