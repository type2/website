Subject: Spark Plug Boots

Archives are not working so I ask the list the following:

I am looking for suggestions for ways to effectively seal around the spark
plug wires where they go through the cooling tin.  I have been very
dissatisfied with the flimsy seals that come with Bosch wire sets.  These
seals harden and shrink in a very short period of time, rendering them
ineffective.  Years back I had a Beetle that came with very thick rubber
hemispherical seals that worked fit the hole in the tin like a grommet.
These things held up for indefinitely, and never hardened. Does anyone know
of a source of a good fitting seal for these holes?
