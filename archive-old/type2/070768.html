&lt;&lt; Any way to start it thru that missing siding, or maybe I should do what 
they do 
 in the movies - yank a bunch of wires out from under the dash, find the wire 
to 
 the starter and a hot wire, and touch them until that baby starts???  Help - 
 I'm as bad at wiring as I am at exhaust!
  &gt;&gt;
find the wires going to the key - on a vw there are 3 or 4. the 4th one is 
for accessories, ignore it unless you're just trying to hot wire the radio. 
strip a patch off of the other 3 (2 red and a black) one red will be battery 
and one will be a starter, the black a coil. cut them and strip them. wrap 
the batt (red) to the coil/ign (black) and within 15 seconds hold the other 
red starter against the other two - and pump the gas - yuu should be good to 
go or perhaps the car will burn to the ground I'm really not sure.
