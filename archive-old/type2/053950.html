Subject: RE: VW Euro 2000 poster

I posted the message just a couple of hours ago and I'm already getting the
most fantastic stories. So I guess the design of this poster is a success. I
will let the list know who will get the poster for the lamest story. For the
others I have a tip:

In order to get the picture on the web I had to scan the poster in 8 parts
(it is that big) and paste them together into one image.

You could do the reverse. Print it on your colour printer enlarged several
times and glue all the individual prints onto a big piece of cardboard. Use
glossy paper and the result will be smashing .... :-)
