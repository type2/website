Subject: Success! No more bungy cord

Well, I finally completed my Rancho trans axle install.  It's so nice to be 
able to drive like a normal person and not have to worry about the bungy 
cord keeping the bus in 4th. I used a '71 trans axle to replace the 091 
that I had previously. The combination of the 1904cc and the new trans axle 
makes the bus a mountain goat ;0) While the engine and trans axle were out, 
I did a shift rod make over with new bushings, boots and guide sleeve.  The 
guide pin was wiggling (causing a lot of slop).  I tried to JB Weld to 
shore it up, but it did not take.  I'm going to have to find someone with a 
welder. The bus shifts nicely with The Berg shifter and will be even better 
once the guide pin id secure. Because of my 1904cc, I am running the header 
heater box combo from Kymco.  I decided to wrap the boxes with header wrap 
to keep the heat in and away from the heads.  What a difference it made 
;0)  I want to use a meat thermometer to find out was the temperature is 
coming from the defroster vents. I am so pleased with the results.  Now, I 
have to install the front and rear sway bars and my Christmas present from 
Ian Janes, a Safare' roof.  Thanks for all who gave insight to my many 
questions.
