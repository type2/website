Subject: Re: [T2] Generator question on 71 Westy

&gt; Hey Everyone,
&gt;
&gt; My first post: Here it goes:
&gt;
&gt; I bought a 71 Westy 2 months ago, I noticed in tightening the generator belt
&gt; on my first maiden voyage that it seemed odd the generator pulley was not in
&gt; line with the crankshaft pulley. I think the generator might be a bug
&gt; generator as the Bosch number on it is 113 903 031P. Can anyone confirm this
&gt; for me ? I heard that a bug generator is shorter  (also it's stamped 30
&gt; amps) and can cause problems. I'm thinking that the PO put a bug engine in
&gt; the bus....

Sounds like a combination of the 38A bus tin and fan hub with the 30A bug
generator.

You have several options.  You could put in a 38A bus generator.  You
could get the proper bug style tin (3 pieces that bolt to the generator)
and the bug fan hub.  You could convert to an alternator.

&gt; I've already bought spare belts just in case.... Has anyone had luck
&gt; converting to a alternator on a 71?

I've done it and I'm happy with the results.  You need the alternator
stand, the three pieces of tin that bolt to the generator, and the bug fan
hub.  You're better off with a used VW stand and tin than with the tin
that is normally included in the &quot;conversion kits&quot;  The VW tin fits right
and is of thicker guage.  The bug fan hub isn't included in the
conversion kits, since the 38A bus fan hub is the &quot;odd&quot; part.

The wiring is simple, consisting of bypassing the stock voltage regulator.
I made up a couple of simple adapters from copper strip so that I could
avoid changing the connectors on the stock wiring.
