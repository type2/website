&gt; Morning,
&gt;         I have a 71' camper (custom high-roof) that needs a front caliper rebuild
&gt; soon.  The pads are not retracting properly.  I need to take it camping in
&gt; a few days and plan on doing it when I get back.  Anyone know what this
&gt; entails?  Is it just check and clean the piston, change dust seal and bleed
&gt; screw?

It is a little more complicated than that.  Check the Bentley procedure
and maybe the Idiot book.  The hardest part for me was removing the
pistons. You clamp off one caliper and apply high pressure air.  Be
careful as the piston can shoot out.  KEEP YOUR FINGERS CLEAR!  Removing
the other piston was the most difficult.  You must seal the empty bore
to get pressure behind the other caliper.  I used a 1/4 inch piece of
plywood with the caliper shim and seal under it clamped with a C clamp. 
It was very hard to keep the seal in place. Repeated attempts and close
centering of the C clamp finally provided a good enough seal to force
the other piston out.  Assembly was easy.  Replace the hoses while your
in there and check the bearings.

Good Luck
