Subject: Tools, Books &amp; Stuff

A fellow model building club member, who's been out of the VW thing for more
than a decade, just gave me the tools, books and other things in this list

If someone could help me to identify the &quot;Whatzit&quot; tools in the list below,
and/or help me to judge the usefulness/values of the publications also
listed, I would be very grateful.
