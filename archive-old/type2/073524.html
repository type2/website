Subject: Type 2 burning up on TV news

Yesterday on San Diego CA KUSI TV news they had a segment showing a 
Bay burning up on the freeway. The camera crew got on scene just as 
the fire department was beating down the flames. The van was totally 
burned out, tires burned off of the rims. It was a sobering picture.

The TV reporter interview the driver who said he started losing 
power, heard a pop and tried to get over, but traffic wouldn't let 
him (sound familiar). It caught on fire in the middle lanes. He tried 
to put it out with his fire extinguisher, but obviously that did not 
work.

I was underneath my Westy yesterday checking my heating ducts and 
also examined my fuel lines. They are in good shape, but I am going 
to replace them sooner rather than later.
