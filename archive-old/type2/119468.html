10 days from PA to TX? You're lucky: it's closer to 14 days out here on the coast and upgrading to expedited shipping elimintes the savings for me.

&gt;I then started searching the
&gt;archive and found a good writeup by my old pal Steve Dolan:
&gt;http://www.type2_dot_com/archive/type2/082575.html
&gt;
&gt;Thanks Steve!!  This writeup spelled out the problem clearly and I was
&gt;relieved to see that a nut and bolt was an acceptable method of attaching the
&gt;emergency brake arm to the shoe, because I have nuts and bolts lying around.

FYI, the original parts are still available from online vendors:

211 609 601B - pin
211 609 619 - c clip

&gt;I bought some new plugs hoping
&gt;that the softer rubber would help them stay in place, but no luck.  I
&gt;flattened out the adjusting holes by carefully tapping bits of mangled metal
&gt;back down into place, which helped but the plugs still wouldn't quite stay in.

I've found the new rubber plugs to be quite hard. Not sure who is making them but I didn't see any VW logos.

I just adjusted the brakes after putting on anti-seize a year ago. It was a breeze to turn the adjusters. I find the anti-seize stays in the barrels quite nicely. I find it gets contaminated with brake dust naturally but I seem to have a tight fit with my adjusters and barrels and the dust only contaminates the gears. I was quite liberal with it and this was my technique:

Time will tell. No one should be replacing rear brakes drums without adding anti-seize to the star adjusters.
