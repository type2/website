&gt;Now I have to find a new tranny.  Does Rancho Performance sell 
&gt;direct?  (I need a trip to a warm place and would like to see if this 
&gt;core is  worth anything before I spend money on shipping.) What other 
&gt;vendors do you recommend?

Steve:

One thing to consider is the core charge.  I checked with Rancho a couple of months ago and was told the core charge for a type 2 tranny is $400.  I checked with a few other tranny shops that advertise in the VW magazines, and they all had similar core charges.  What they don't tell you is that your tranny has to be re-buildable, and if it's not, you don't get your core charge back.  Also, you have to pay to ship your old tranny to the shop you buy the new one from.  I talked to Weddle engineering, and they had a lower core charge, and I was told that they would refund part of your core charge if parts of your old tranny are re-usable.  Also, they seem a lot more inclined to use custom gear ratios than most of the other shops.  I'll probably buy from them when I decide to splurge on a new tranny.
