Subject: Oil Temp on 81/83 Vanagon
Message-ID: &lt;19991015220009.14294.qmail_at_www0l_dot_netaddress_dot_usa_dot_net&gt;

HI,
Had the oil temp gauge unplugged for a long time. Sender was on the original
engine, swaped out. 
So last weekend I go find the Oil temp sender, pull it out of the oil sump,
and put it back in my 83 7 passenger Air Cooled. The 83 had a problem last
week where it overheated on the highway after about 40 minutes _at_ 70MPH. It
just stopped running and the oil on the case started smoking...

So the question is.. It seems _at_ 65MPH the oil temp stabilizes _at_260 deg.

Is this hot? Is this OK? I asked on the vanagon list and they told me to ask
you all.

All the sheet metal is there, It is in tune enough to get it through Calif.
Smog. So what could be the issue with it over heating _at_ 70MPH? Is that just
too fast for an 83 A/C Vanagon? It seemed to be a quart low when I checked it
out by the side of the highway. After it cooled down, it started back up and
ran like the champ it always does.

Tahnks,
tim o'brien
