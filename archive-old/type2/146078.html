Subject: Re: [T2] Heat Exchanger Quality

Richard,  I am not trying to make it negative. I wish some one could have 
warned me about GEX engines before I bought one. People bash GEX daily. When you 
make a bed, you must sleep in it. The internet is great for that. Info can 
spread in a matter of minutes. This is a informative place. And I am passing 
information. What would be rude, is going around behind his back and saying things 
about his business. It's all on the table and open for discussion. Don't 
mistake a comment for a argument.
