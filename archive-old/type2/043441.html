Jessica,

What you need to do is get a friend to slowly turn the steering wheel back and
forth while you lay under it and look.  The rods and levers should have NO up
and down motion.  Just side to side.  The only thing that should move on the
steering box is the input and output shafts  And these should have rotational
movement only.  What you are looking for is 'play', that is one part moving
without the part that it's connected to moving.  Any play is wear. 
Theoretically, when you turn the steering wheel more than about 3/4&quot; (20mm)
things underneath should begin to move.  In practice, about an inch and a half
(40mm) is about the limit of acceptability.  After 20 years, things wear.
(BTW, you have the proper tyres, I assume?)

&gt; steering also takes too long to respond.
&gt; 
&gt; i have beed told that is the left outer tierod and the idler i looked
&gt; and could see nothing wrong with them. I was also told that was
&gt; bearing at top of steering box, when steering wheel is turned, the
&gt; top of the steering box does move a bit from side to side. is this
&gt; indicating there is something wrong with it or just normal?
&gt;
