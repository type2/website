&gt;I have a lead on a 2 ltr. high performance Porsche 914 engine. With dual 44
&gt;webers, and 009 dist.The questions that I have are;
&gt; 1. How do you identify the engine as a 914 Porsche?

If you can pull the valve covers, look at the valve stems.  The valves in
the 2.0 914 are sodium filled and are significantly fatter than the valves
in the bus 2.0.  Did I mention those sodium filled Porsche valves cost $80
each?  Better hope you never have to replace one.

&gt; 2. If this is a high output (big compression) what sort of timing needs to
&gt;take place
&gt;     to handle today's cheap gas.

If the compression is very high, no practical amount of timing retardation
will eliminate the detonation.  You would need to put spacers under the
cylinders to lower the compression.

&gt; 3. Can your replace the heads or have them shaved( to reduce the compression)
&gt;while they  are in the BUS?

No, you will have to remove them from the bus, and as another person
already said, shaving will *increase* compression, not reduce it.  The way
to reduce compression is with the spacers I mentioned above.   You could
also open up the combustion chambers, but you would only want a
professional to do this.
&gt;
&gt;Price on the engine is $2300 what do you think of the price?

*gag*

&gt;I have a 2 Ltr in the bus now and like the extra power.

I'd say stick with what you have, which is a reasonably powerful, reliable
motor.  The Porsche engine sounds like a money pit to me.
