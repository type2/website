Subject: Re: [T2] Bumper replacement

&lt;&lt;&lt;Why would you think the new bumper is going to look ugly?&gt;&gt;

A new bumper would look good.
A C-Channel bumper is something out of a stone quarrey, or a dirt
excavating job, hanging off the front end of a class 8 18 wheeler.
Functional, but not pretty at all.

&lt;&lt; I get a kick out of some people's thinking that only original looks
nice.&gt;&gt;

I gotta say that the bumper's on a type 2 Bus are pretty good looking,
especially if thet have a set of overrider's on them--alll chrome is
real nice.
 
&lt;&lt;I also like to think in the terms of functional. Building a better
more functional bumper so that I can haul 4 kids mountain bikes around
so they can have fun.&gt;&gt;&gt;

You don't need a rock quarry 100 ton truck bumper to have function.

&lt;&lt; Or I can use the existing one which isn't..&gt;&gt;

Again, attach a class 2 hitch under the stock bumper with a bike rack
slid into it.
Not bad looking, removable, and less work to get the same job done.

 &lt;&lt; add a reciever under the already not functional bumper.&gt;&gt;

Why do you think that the stock bumper is not functional?
It's been pretty functional for some time on all Type 2 Buses.

&lt;&lt;Why add extra weight when one will do? &gt;&gt;

James,

Yor going to be adding one hell of a bunch more weight to the ass end of
your Bus with that quarry truck bumper &amp; bike hauling set up--more than
the stock unit with a hitch mounted bke rack on it anyway. 

Hey--It's you vehicle--go ahead and hack it up---
