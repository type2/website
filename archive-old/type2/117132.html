Subject: Fuel Line Replacement - Difference for double carb?

I am not familiar with the double carb setup.  Can someone please tell me
what would be difference in changing fuel lines in comparison to a single
carb?  How much extra fuel hose is needed?  How many more clamps would be
needed?

Thanks,
Shawn.

BTW Billy, in the 1970's Canada used inches too!  LOL.... but perhaps I can
do both measurements.
