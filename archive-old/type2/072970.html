Subject: IT'S ALIIIIIIVE!!!

The 69 Westy runs!!!! Praise be to H. Steve. He accomplished in a week what
would've taken me a year wrestling with the learning curve. He chivalrously
volunteered for the hazardous voyage from the alley out back to the curb
out front (for maximum neighborhood annoyance). Steve got a picture of me
and the cheering section (neighborhood girls) with the bus after he parked
it out front. Will post pics real soon now.

It doesn't go fast, it doesn't far, but it goes. Woo-hoo!

Nikki
