Subject: Oil Leaking...Help
To: type2_at_type2_dot_com


Hey, My bus is leaking oil..Nothing major but I noticed as I pulled it
out of the garage yesterday that there was an oil spot underneath the
bus. Yikes!
Is this a huge deal? Is it common for small oil leaks?
Any help is appreciated.

Thanks,

Greg
