i get a sick feeling in my guts evey time i think i'm cutting a corner on
costs for parts, no matter how small.  never the less money is way tight
[i'm living/working out of the bus].
i don't know about their quality, that's what i'm asking.
i've heard to stay away from GEX - the're more expensive anyway...
i don't want to put it together and have it die... of course.
should i look in the paper, go with something there temporarily, and
rebuild my motor on the side?
i barely/don't really have the money to spend, nor the time, only working
weekends in Sac and with the suspension [cv rr toast, plus that
swing-arm-towheel-lower-shock-mount that is now broken off at the weld-fix
&gt;from someothertime] - and no spare or rr rim/tire...

AVP has them in the $700 range with core [should i go outright and save as
much as i can of my old motor for parts?] i can only guess they are talking
about long-blocks with flywheel etc... vwparts has a listing of what the
engine includes.
never had to crack the case, and had the top-end done by Der Wagen Shop,
Sacto. CA on my '71.5 transporter i rebuilt in '90 - so this whole
case-guts thing is new to me.
i've got to be on the road again in two weekends.maybe 3.

&gt;&gt;         vwparts_dot_net has them for $600 - so i'm looking at about $800-$900 
&gt;to put
&gt;&gt; it all back together [plus my suspension nightmare] is this the best price
&gt;&gt; and quality long block i can hope for for the price?
&gt;
&gt;How's their quality? Getting a &quot;bargain&quot; isn't a bargain if it craps out
&gt;on you in 10,000 miles...
&gt;
&gt;What's AVP's price? They're in Sacramento, aren't they?
