Subject: Re: [T2] ordered tires...interesting

&gt;Slammed is the nom du jour...But really it's that boy racer look...Aero
&gt;add-ons, coffee can exhaust tips, decal graphics, etc.
&gt;Years ago I knew a real 'street racer', a money racer who's Dodge
&gt;Coronet looked like a beat NYC taxi but had a 426 Hemi under the
&gt;hood and plenty of muffling...Until he opened the dumps...

Sleepers - now those I REALLY like the best. Quiet and normal looking until 
the hammer is put down... GOODBYE!
