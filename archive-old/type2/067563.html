Subject: Curtain Set for sale w/hardware Breadloaf

This weekend while I was doing chores for my parents a neighbor came
over and told me his stepfather had a Westfalia in his junk yard and that
he would take me to look at it.  It is a 78 Tiaga Green Westfalia.  I left the
junk yard with a full green curtain set with hardware minus the
hardware and curtains for the very back. This includes the front curtain. 
The set has the usual fading but otherwise in good shape.  I will pass
this on to someone on the list for a fair price.  I am located in Annapolis
Maryland.  I also scored another overhead cabinet  and in addition the
back cabinet set up.  I will take inquires about these if a members is
interested.  I might hold on to them though.  This van is still in the junk
yard.  It has the bottom bench/bed, the ice cabinet set up, upper bed with
material, two front seats material is in good shape but normal wear and
tear, and one jealousy window minus black turn mechanism.  The engine
is in there and looks pretty good.  I had a hard time containing myself
while I was there.  If people are interested I will get prices on some of
these other items.  I will wait for a bit though because I don't want to ruin
a good thing.  I have no intention at ripping this guy off because he helps
my folks out with yard work and don't want any bad karma.  So give me
your wish lists and prices and I will see if I can broker a deal.
