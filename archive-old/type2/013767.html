Subject: 73 auto 1700 ignition vs. 74 auto 1700 ignition (long)
To: type2_at_type2_dot_com

Hello List,

Yes, I know, another question. I did alitle research
today on the Old Volks Home web sight. I looked up the
ignition setup that was used on the 1700 automatic bus
for both 1973 and 1974. Between each year model there
was a change in the distributor, condencer and vacuum
can. The retard, advance and vacuum didn't seem to be
all that different. I have a 74 bus with a 73
automatic 1700 engine in it. My question is:

Would it be feasible to install a 74 automatic
ignition settup over a 73 ignition settup? I ask this
because I know that ignition parts for the 74 model
are easier to come buy. The settup that is on my bus
now appears to be thrown together from different cars.
Here are the specs for each:
