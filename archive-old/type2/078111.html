Subject: Portland OR USA: 1970 black rear bench seat to good home

Hi, folks.

I replaced my original rear seat last weekend with an almost perfect one 
from Carter &amp; Son in Chehalis WA.

The original is free to a good home; I don't really want to try and ship it, 
and I don't have a good place to store it, so it'll have to be to someone 
who can pick it up, arrange a hand-off, etc.

Specifics:

- black basket weave
- springs and horsehair in good shape
- vinyl peeled slightly at one spot on seat back
- metal corner flashing for seatback
- 2 or 3 short tears/punctures patched solidly but not skillfully
- floor mounting bolts included

It's in good shape, just not not mint. And it's free to a good home.  Send 
me P-mail if you're ready to take custody.

thanks

Bill
