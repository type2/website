From Mike Benthin:

I'm surprised you don't burn up the shrink tube before the solder melts-
does the solder inside go the length of the tube?  I'm very handy with a 
 minitorch and hand-held solder and often have roughed the spade lugs 
with a 12v Dremyl chain saw sharpener and bridge-soldered the lug to the wire.
