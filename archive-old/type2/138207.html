Subject: Wheel talk

Lots of talk on this list about wheels and tires. I can understand 
having wheel diameter envy after watching SUVs with wheels and tires 
from earthmoving machines roll down the highway.

But let me say it: the more I look at stock, 14&quot; pressed steel, 
post-1970 VW bus wheels, especially in white paint, the more I think 
they're the most beautiful road wheels ever made. I'm even going to 
pitch my trim rings, which detract from the wheels.

Mark
