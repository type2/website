I did a tranny transplant on Lurch a few years back with a used unit that I 
bought at a VW show here in Knoxville (thanks to DocRic for loaning me the 
bread).  

The old one had been sitting in the garage when I heard of someone on this 
list who could rebuild it.  Well, that was a bust.  I am out $350 and a 
serviceable tranny.  

Now the one that's in Lurch is starting to leak around the axle.  Its been 
popping out of 4th for a few thousand miles.  I NEED a working tranny.  
Assuming my tranny will make it to Everybus, is there any way of connecting 
with a good used one there?  Fellow listees?

I also would like to get an uncracked steering wheel and the bracket that 
holds the steering column to the dash (that houses the ignition switch).  The 
PO had a locksmith drill a big old honkin' hole in it to remove the old 
ignition switch.  I would like to find one with the sticker (about the 
sliding door) still attached.

I appreciate the help.  You guys are great!  See you at Everybus!
