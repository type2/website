Yep, on amount of money or wise audio choices will buy taste or manners.  I
have a system that is quite capable of being loud.  Especially if I chose to
play music that was just designed to make your ears itch.  But, you just
don't do it in the middle of the night (maybe on the freeway) and you
certainly don't need to when you are in someone's neighborhood.  Just not a
nice thing to do.  My bedroom window is situated less than 10 feet from the
street, and less than 50 from the most popular teen girl in the area.  I
hear it all.  Just not for very long. :-)

&gt;Just out of curiosity George, why do you believe that a powerful auto
&gt;stereo would have to be 'annoying'?


Mostly when they drive by my house at 2 AM with the stereo at high volume
levels..

That's annoying! (Especially when it wakes my two year old). That's
r-e-a-l-l-y annoying...
