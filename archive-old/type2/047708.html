Subject: Re: [T2] WTB. Westfalia roof brace

&gt; It is a angle brace with a diagonal brace at each end,,
&gt; I want to put it on my 74,  and I think they came on 77 and 78's
&gt; Anyways,, If you see a Westy top with one,, keep me in mind,
I have these braces on my '77 and they are all bent in every which way not
making the poptop seat correctly when in the down position.  So if anyone
has a supply of these let me know.  For clarification, mine are not the ones
pictured in the Bentley.  My roof hinges in the rear.  Thanks
Dave
