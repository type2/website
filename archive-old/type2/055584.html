The seminal text for this is &lt;u&gt; How to Hot Rod Volkswagen Engines &lt;/u&gt; by
Bill Fisher (HPBooks ISBN 0-912565-03-4).  The book is from 1970 but so's 
your VW :-)  Fisher does a good job of explaining what you trade for speed.
Namely, if you want 150HP out of a VW engine, you tried engine life.  As in,
you reduce it to 20 minutes.  Which turns out to be plenty on the dragstrip.

It's highly unlikely that a breadloaf did 105MPH with a porsche motor...
The torque is not *that much* more even though the HP is.   A beetle with
a porsche motor would be another story.  But it would probably be much
better with a corvair...

On the OTHER HAND...  If he was going down a 6% grade somewhere in Idaho, 
with that continental-divide wind behind him, and no brakes...  105 mph is
easily attained with a 40 horse :-)

If it weren't for the last minute, nothing would ever get done.
