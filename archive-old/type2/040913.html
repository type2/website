Subject: no reverse in 73 automatic

   Hello all, today I got my 73 bus with auto trans stuck and while in the 
process of getting unstuck reverse quit working.  When I shift into R nothing 
happens, motor just idles and I don't here anything, it doesn't even try to 
move.  I have briefly looked at Bentley manual and nothing jumped out at me.  
Anyone on the list have any ideas or suggestions?  Does anyone know were to 
locate a rebuild kit for the early automatic transmission?  Thanks, Marcus
