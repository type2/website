George..

I used the metal gaskets last time I pulled off the manifold and they seem
to work quite well.  Fairly similar to the metal gaskets on the exhaust
system.  I think they'll do you right.

Proper torque is... tight.

You'll have a heck of a time getting a torque wrench on one nut on each of
the intake manifolds.

Question:  Has anyone looked at the use of the metal intake manifold
gaskets versus the paper gaskets?  I've been a bit leery of the metal
gaskets, as they don't seem to be a tolerant of mismatch as the paper
gaskets.  I used paper on the last engines I did, along with a film of
hylomar.

&gt; Hi folks--
&gt;
&gt; I want to check whether my intake manifold has a leak
&gt; at the heads after 6 months of break-in.  Does anyone
&gt; know what the proper torque for those nuts would be?
&gt; I've been through my library of too-many-manuals, but
&gt; can't find a number.
&gt;
&gt; thanks
