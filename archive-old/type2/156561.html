Subject: Re: [T2] exhaust leaks- are old gaskets still available?

Asbestos has become such an anathema to environmentalists that a  product that is useful in many situations such as this is now  unavailable to those who could benefit from it.  Sure, it'll give  you cancer if you like to stick your nose in your exhaust pipe on a  regular basis.  But the carbon monoxide would get you long before  that.  I guess we can thank the attorneys for the current state of  affairs.  They've thrown common sense out with the DDT.   And  don't get me started on nuclear energy.  If I can figure out how  to run my bus by nuclear reactor (air-cooled), the 1.7/Weber/009 is so  outa here.  Cheers...KR

with the &quot;asbestos&quot; core were better- are they still available?
