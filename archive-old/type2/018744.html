I discovered an Air/Fuel Ratio Gauge through CB Performance that can be
installed in any 4 stroke vehicle.  My thinking is that this would be
the best way to get a set of carbs jetted and running correctly.  I
don't know the price on the gauge and sender yet, but the expense should
be less
than multiple trips to a carb shop, if I could even find one.  The
alternative is to take my bus to a shop and trust them the do it right.
I'm running duel Dellorto's on an 1800.  Anybody have advice on a better

way to adjust carbs?  Does anybody out there use an Air/Fuel gauge?  Is
it worth it or is the gauge just another gizmo I don't need?
Thanks for the input.
