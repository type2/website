I know, this reply violates the standard that you want to follow, but what
the heck! :)

I think that you have a good idea, but getting it across to the list is
another matter.  Too many email programs (like this one) put the new text
at the top and are cumbersonme to use otherwise.

However, if you write a short blurb for the list charter, I'll pass it
along to the chartermeister and we'll see about adding it.

&gt; Hi!
&gt; 
&gt; I'm a member of the Type 2 List in digest form, and lately
&gt; I've been quite unnerved by the large proportion of Volks
&gt; who quote wrongly, in spite of the charter that says, 
&gt; &quot;quote only for context, do not quote entire messages&quot;.
&gt; Quite many tend to write the reply above the quoted
&gt; text, and to not trim the quoted text to the necessary
&gt; amount, instead of adopting the regular scheme of
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; question
&gt; answer
&gt; &gt; question
&gt; answer
&gt; 
&gt; like it's suggested on Usenet.  Yeah, this isn't Usenet,
&gt; but I think it's sufficiently similar to warrant the
&gt; same quoting style.
&gt; 
&gt; However, I believe that's due to lack of education mostly.
&gt; I think that an educating message could help.  This could
&gt; be posted to the List once, or in long intervals; sent
&gt; to new subscribers; and maybe sent to offenders, which 
&gt; might be caught by filters.
&gt; 
&gt; What do you think?
&gt; 
&gt; I'd volunteer to write up such a message if you think it's
&gt; a worthwhile idea.  However, I just thought I'd check with
&gt; you before addressing the List myself, and indeed think
&gt; it would be more effective if an admin did the addressing.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks for reading; please let me know.
&gt; 
&gt; Airhowlingly yours,
&gt;    Erik.
