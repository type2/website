In a message dated 99-04-06 18:19:44 EDT, you write:

&lt;&lt; our power drill to sand the rim, be careful of the valve stem.  Spread
 Go-Jo hand cleaner or other similar product on the tire.  make sure you
 get the stuff right up to the rim and over the entire surfice of the tire. &gt;&gt;

Rob &amp; the list,
    Perhaps an easier way, and maybe less messy way of painting rims is to 
use 6-8
inch aluminum roof flashing. If you've got an Eastwood catalog, look for 
their &quot;Wheel
Tire Masks&quot; _at_ $24.99. This is where I got the idea. However, I had a roll of 
aluminun flashing left over from a roof repair on my house, granted, maybe 
something not everyone has laying around, but I did. Cut a strip about 7-8 
inches longer than the circumference of the rim, so it overlaps. Size it to 
the rim and secure with duct tape.
Its also reusable, like Eastwoods. The thing I find amusing about Eastwoods 
is they sell them in a set of 4 for $24,99 plus shipping. HMMM, lets see, I 
made ONE and moved it from wheel to wheel, as I found it impossible to paint 
more than one wheel at a time. Eastwood sells some neat stuff, but I've found 
I can always find the same stuff locally for far less $$$.       Jeff S.
