Subject: 73-79 emblem attatchment

G'day Paul,
Just reading some old posts.
On my bus I have welded up all the holes in the panel work (they just attract
rust) and have re-attached the emblem and side striping with body mould tape.
I has worked well and is still holding strong after ~12 months.
Cheers,
Richard
