A friend of mine owns an '84 Vanagon and was told he had a bad head and
valves.  I know the quality of advice I have received on this list and was
wondering if we could be pointed in the right direction for where to get
replacement parts.  I know.... watercooled....but, gotta help a fellow
VWber. Engine is the 1.9 liter eng # DH 012588.  Oh yea...we are in Italy
also.  Head # 025 101 165 X or V. TIA
