Subject: Re: [T2] Warning : What a bad clutch driven plate will do to 
  your bus

And the next question is....what happens to your balance when it is time 
to replace the pressure plate that you balanced with the first time?

The pressure plates are generally considered fairly balanced from the 
factory...although I have never personally had one checked, so that is 
just an assumption.



Cheers, dave

&gt; &gt;From what i understand about balancing, they balance everything together, 
&gt; too.(crank, flywheel, pressure plate , clutch, rods, pistons) for all that 
&gt; work you did do, may be for naught if your pressure plate is heavy on one 
&gt; side :(( .

&gt; At least that is the way my local street rod shop does it.............
