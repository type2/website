Subject: Re: [T2] radio repair

I am indeed out here, but I'm sorry to say I don't do the radio repair thing 
anymore, at least not in public ;-). 

Brad

&lt;I
&gt; searched the archives and came up with Brad Clausen and his VW radio
&gt; repair, but his last post was in 99 and his homepage link doesn't work.
&gt; Are you out there Brad? If not, any other suggestions?
&gt;
