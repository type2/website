Simple. Follow the normal valve adjusting procedure which requires you to use the rotor in the distributor to find TDC for #1. Turn the valve adustment screw until it contacts the valve stem, then 1.5-2 turns more. Bentley says 1 turn only, but wisdom and experience states the former. Rotate the engine 180 degree backwards, then do the valves for #2, then repeat for #3, then #4. Done.
