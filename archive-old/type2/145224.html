Subject: Another Type IV engine question...

I am working on a 72 Westy and I am switching back to
stock dual carbs and taking OFF a Weber Progessive
single carb. Anyway, when I took the intake manifold
from the Weber carb off of the head, there is a REALLY
thick gasket\spacer type thingy.  It was between the
intake manifold and the intake ports on the head.  It
is ONE piece that has cut-outs for BOTH intake ports
(kinda looks like a pair of eye-glasses or a Lone
Ranger mask!!).  My question is this:  Is this thing
specifically for the Weber intake or do I need to
re-install it under the dual carb manifolds??  OR do I
just put one of those thin metal type gaskets under
each port on the dual carb intakes???  I am not at all
familiar with these pancake engines...

Peace, John Baker
