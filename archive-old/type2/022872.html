Subject: Vac. Advance Distributor
Mime-Version: 1.0

Coming off the carburetor, going to the advance diaphragm,
the tubing route uses that metal tube, bent loop up and then another 
loop down,
so as to prevent fuel from getting to the diaphragm.
(correct ?, is that the purpose ?)

Not having one of these metal tubes, what ingenuity has been 
implemented by others so as to create this loop de loop route?
Create a frame or cradle for the tube?

Or has it been found to be OK to just run the vac. tube direct from the 
carb and into the dizzy without worrying about gas possibly getting to 
the vacuum advance mechanisms?
