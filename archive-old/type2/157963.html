Subject: Runs a while then quits(80 Vanagon)

This is a stock 2.0L with fuel injection, 1980 air
cooled. It will run for a few blocks, then quit, it
may start back and it may not, sometimes have to wait
more than two hours, sometimes run the battery down
trying to start it to get back home. Have changed the
fuel filter, the old one was clean, replaced the AFM,
no change , also replaced the eletronic brain, with no
change. Put new spark plugs and points also, still no
change. Did compression test just for fun the range is
118 low -124 high.  Phil
