Subject: tire sale-any exp with this tire?
Mime-Version: 1.0

My local Goodyear tire place has a 50% off sale ($55/tire) on leftover
Infinitread tires, has 8 in the size I use, 195-75R14, and I was impressed
with the rather high pressure rating: 44psi...the rest of the tire is
similar to the Michelin Roadhandlers I've used for 200k MILES Load
capacity- 1400 lbs, 3ply tread (1P2S), 1ply sidewall (claims it's thicker
to get the pressure rating), better milage warantee (over 70K, has very
deep tread with four circumferential grooves that are fairly wide, are
marked Mud &amp; Snow, Traction A, Treadwear B.   I believe they were waranteed
to last over 75K mi.
     Any experience with these tires?  My main concern is are they noisy,
being more of a mud/snow tire with a fairily close tread pattern that seems
to be like an all season tire (he said they were all season).
    If no negative experience, I'd pass this on as a good deal??? MB
