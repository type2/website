&gt;&gt; Sorry to hear it. I think your assessment is correct. Can't be fixed
&gt;&gt; without teardown. Might or might not last who knows how long. You just have
&gt;&gt; to bite the bullet and scrounge the bucks to budget a motor R&amp;R. I would
&gt;&gt; consider sending the GEX in as a core Who knows what else is GEXed up in
there. 
&gt;
&gt;Nothing else is GEXed up in there because nothing in there is GEX, just
&gt;didn't have a case when I did the rebuild year and half ago, the case was
&gt;thourghly inspected but obviously missed this.....I put almost $2,500 into
&gt;this 1gram balance rebuild, mahle piston, new cam, etc, etc, etc  really
&gt;can't afford to do this every year or so.
&gt;

Well, good news. Now you must throw good time/money after salvaging the
good time/money put in there. If you know the crank/case oversizes for your
stuff, get a rebuild case with the same overbore mains and put all your
parts in it. If the crank was just polished and uncut, get a new case and
main bearings std/std. If you cleaned everything nicely in the past work,
it will come apart and go back together very quickly. Bench time to tear
down the longblock and replace the case and reassemble would per but a few
hours for a pro, a few more for a savy, carefull, DIY'er. Sounds like you
can salvage a great deal of value by doing it as soon as possible and not
risk loss of oil pressure and foul all the good parts parts in there.

To maintain the high specs of the former rebuild, if you use a rebuilt
case, make absolutely certain of the alignment of the case mains. A line
bore guage is required, but a precision straight edge will give a good
sence of any obvious warpage. If a case is welded for cracks or such, it
will certainly have to be line bored to next oversize after full annealing
and cooldown procedures.

I don't mind going 1st oversize on the case mains. 2nd oversize ONLY if I
know the history of the motor. I don't like any cutting of the crank. Used,
polished and in original uncut spec., or new. The process for surface
hardening the journals is patented, and only few are licensed to use the
process, ie, expensive. Without replicating the the very thin, very hard,
but very resistant to cracking results of the metalurgy, you won't get the
200k+ miles life of the real deal process.
