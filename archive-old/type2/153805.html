Subject: Dumb question No. 736 :-)

I've just bought a CD/Mp3 player that I'm going to install into my 77 Westy.
Our vehicles do not have an accessory spot on the ignitions, just off or on.
How are people wiring their players in? I have a yellow wire to go to +12volts
always on for the memory, but then I have a red one that is to go to accessory
on, which we don't have on our vehicles. Should I just wire it direct to the
same place then as the yellow wire? I can't think of any other way in a
vehicle like this? How much does the LED face on these units draw? I'd hate to
have my battery dead if I left it parked for a week as I often do.
Courtney
