Subject: Re: [T2] Advice neaded,


&gt; There is a book called something like &quot;where to camp for $5 or less&quot; or
&gt; something like that.  A bus camper from up north had one at a campout I was
&gt; at last summer and it was really full of places from every state, a good
&gt; investment, check your local bookstore.

It's called camping on a Shoestring East at least for the East Coast of the USA.  I ordered
at copy from Amazon back in Oct.  It is on backorder, still.

Camping in AIRS driveways would be your best bet.  IF you come through Charleston, SC, you
would be more than welcome to stay in my driveway.

Peace Brothers and Sisters,
Snoopy
