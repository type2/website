Subject: Re: [T2] oil light on at idle

&gt; My oil light has always come on in the summer at hot idle.  Some oil
&gt; pressure senders come on higher than others.  This way for 30,000 miles--no
&gt; problems.

Ive got the impression you have a 1600 with a stock sender.
Stock sender should be off with just a few psi.
If it was me I would have checked the pressure with a gauge and replaced
the sender if it was out of spec. If its correct and the engine is tired I
would have used a heavier oil and possibly upped the idle a tad.
Stock senders should all be about the same. the VDO dual senders come on
at a higher pressure like 7 psi I think. My dual sender used to
blink with my old very tired engine but never now.

&gt; &gt; Just an indication that the engine is warm and oil is thinner--engine
&gt; clearances may not be up to DM spec.  I actually use Pennzoil HD 30 which I
&gt; think holds up better in the summer (then again I blew out my oil cooler
&gt; seals in the winter).
&gt;

Still it is an important indicator and is best functioning correctly so
when you see it on you know it means something.
You said a heap by mentioning the engine may not be up to spec. We have 2
questions then. Is the lamp wrong and needs fixing or is there really a
low pressure problem.

&gt; As long as it goes out as soon as you rev it the slightest, you shouldn't
&gt; worry.  But DO keep an eye on your temperature, be aware of the dipstick
&gt; test, if its too hot to hold, then you have other problems: timing off,
&gt; vacuum leak (lean), missing tin/seals, etc.

You should worry unless you verify the cause.
-Bad indicator?
-Low oil pressure? Caused by
 -Overheating? Missing tin, seals etc?
 -Worn oil pump?
 -Worn tired engine bearings?
_Something I left out?


Especially if you have no gauges this is pretty much the only
warning you get so dont take it lightly.
