Subject: Re: [T2] re Full Flow filters for upright engine

Berg has an oil pressure relief oil pump cover
which limits pump output to 125 psi ( and returns
excess to the pump inlet ) for full-flow application.
This could also be 90 psi, depending on where you read it.
The minimal downside is that hot oil is recycled through
the pump until it is delivered to the filter.

Subject: [T2] re Full Flow filters for upright engine


&gt; I am having an engine built on nearly new Mexican cases. I'm getting it
&gt; drilled and tapped for full flow. I have read in the archives that people
&gt; have used Fram HP1 filters for this, since a normal filter will explode at
&gt; the 300psi pre-pressure relief valve pressures here. I am wondering if the
&gt; stock Mann VW filter can take this pressure, or are there any other
choices?
&gt; I prefer the Mann but I'll settle for Fram HP1 if it is the only choice...
&gt; Also, are these filters hard to find and expensive, or available at my
local
&gt; Wally World?
