Subject: colorado springs area camping?

Hello,

Ill be heading north on I-25 working my way towards Minneapolis, MN (picking 
up a bus in Albuquerque NM) next weekend and wondering what places near 
Colorado Springs would be not too far off I-25 and not too much of a massive 
RV park?

Any tips, suggestions, or general tomfoolery is welcome.


Best,
aircooled chris
