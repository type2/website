It is my understanding (FWIW) that a good quality DC voltmeter or
digital multimeter
connected to the existing O2 sensor  (if you have one) will work just
fine. The O2 sensor puts out 0-1 V from lean to rich and I have the
voltage range for the correct mixture strength somewhere if I could only
find it! I think it is available in the archives. Can anyone on the list
confirm this?
Thanks, Jack
