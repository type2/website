&gt;Well, it's now 4 months since they received the cores and no refund or
&gt;explanation.  I've called 3 times and each time they say they will look into
&gt;it and call me back...

You can consult the archives and find that this is an endemic problem with
MSHP. There's no sense being in a hurry because they aren't going to give
you any of the core charge back anyway unless the heads are so pristine you
would never send them in as cores in the first place.

Some people speculate that MSHP is using the cores as a profit center--it's
a way of charging two different customers to repair the same head. This is
one reason a lot of people on the list seem to like to work with AVP
instead, reports have been that the quality is just as good (for
daily-driver level stuff) and the core policy is a a lot more reasonable.
All-in-all it makes the AVP heads substantially less expensive once all the
&quot;three card Monte&quot; is settled.
