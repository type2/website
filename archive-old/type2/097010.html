Subject: Compression

I am about to purchase a bus that I am very excited about.  We did a
compression test that had the following results: #1 - 140, #2 - 138, #3
- 135, #4 - 125.  Is there any cause for concern for the 15 lb
difference between #1 &amp; #4 ?
 
Muir says that they should be within five lbs of each other, and if one
cylinder is weak it indicates either an imbalance in wear, improper
installation of the rings or a burnt valve.
 
Thanks
