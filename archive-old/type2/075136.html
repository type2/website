Subject: GA cops and buses

I just had to tell the list what just happened to some folks that came down 
from Ohio today to pickup a couple of my buses. They were actually picking 
them of for a friend of theirs and I dont think they will be wanting to come 
down to Florida anytime soon. They drove a flat bed tow truck with the thing 
on the back to haul a second vehicle. This is what the new owner just 
emailed to me:

&gt;just thought you would like to know i talked to bob about 3:30 after
&gt;he got picked up
&gt;before atlanta, the cops searched him plus vans,truck and his baggage
&gt;they thought maybe he was transporting drugs possibly all is okay though
&gt;they expect to be home tonight around 12:00 or 1:00a.m.

Doesnt this sound like the GA cops were kinda picking on some bus folks 
?????
