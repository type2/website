Subject: Re: PHOOEY on HOT VWs!!!  :-(

&gt;So let me get this straight-you actually WANTED to appear in this trashy
&gt;rag?  I must admit, though, it was a pretty good idea to write the article
&gt;yourself.  Their writers couldn't write themselves out of a wet paper bag.
&gt;For the record I prefer VolksWorld when I can get it.

Yeah! To be quite honest with you, I wrote the article and had the 
photo shoot done for the guys at the shop who did the paint job. They 
are truly AWESOME guys and they really wanted her to be in a magazine. 
I bought several issues of HOT VWs and Fake Titted Babes so I could 
learn their style... and hopefully write in their genre.... I soon 
figured out that they are a perfect example of the genre of no genre! 
And, since Her Majesty is so unique, and considering Simurda's 
promising reply to my query, I figured I could glorify the guys at the 
body shop and they could show copies of the mag to all their customers 
and friends. But - old Bruce blew me off.

PHOOEY!
