Subject: Aftermarket Pull starter?

Hello,
I have a faint memory of a VW fitted with a lawn mower type of pull starter 
on an upright beetle type motor.
Has any one ever seen this or was I halucinating on some bad herbs?
Keep in mind this was in the &quot;Hang ten&quot; foot shaped gas pedal and R. Crumb 
&quot;Keep on trucking&quot; days of the early 1970s so anything goes.

&quot;Keep on trucking&quot;
Rusty
