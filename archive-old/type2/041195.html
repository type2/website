Subject: Saggy Rear End

My 78 Bus has a saggy rear end. Someone told me they all do a little, but
after comparing it w/ other Busses in town, she's lower than most.

I'm an artist and I'm having an exhibition in Salt Lake City, 4 hours north,
and I was hoping to be able to pull a small trailer if all the paintings
won't fit in the cab.  I hope to come into possession of the hitch soon but
I don't want the extra weight to break her back.

And quite honestly, its the cosmetic/aesthetic aspect of the droopy rear
that displeases me the most. I had air shocks on a Beetle and I checked w/
Checker Auto Parts , and they're still available - but not for the Bus. The
guy helping me told me the measurements were exactly the same except for one
part, which could be cut off and then they would fit the Bus. As soon as he
said &quot;cut&quot; I wasn't paying close attention any more so I 'm not sure what
part he was talking about. . Hot VW's did a  rear end spring repair on a
type 1 a while back, but it was NOT a Bus and the whole operation seemed a
little unclear to me.

QUESTIONS: Has any one found airshocks that fit a Bus? Or alter Monroe
(sp.?) airshocks to fit a Bus?
Or is the rear spring job not as bad as it seems?

Thanks All,
