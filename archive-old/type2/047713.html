Subject: Re: [T2] VW Bus Manuals on CD

The advertisement that I got from RBB stated that 1.) the manuals
support both Windows and Mac O/S and 2.) they retail for $99.95 and
appear to come with on-line support. 

The Vanagon manual will be available next Friday (10-27), the EV
manual is scheduled for December 6.  I suspect that they are releasing
them in order based on 'dead tree' manual sales.

For details goto &lt;http://www.bentleypublishers_dot_com/browse.htm?subject=21&gt;

Lastly, I know that Bentley (or someone with the inside track to
Bentley) monitors the Vanagon list, they might well 'listen' to these
lists as well. (Where do you think the idea of 'electronic' manuals
came from?) ;o)
