Subject: Re: CB radio Station???

a lot of talk about cb's lately, is it 1974?  but there is a radioshack cb on 
sale right now for $39.95 full power really small size, about the size of a 
european pack of cigs, 
man oh man there's a lot of busses w/ cb's out there, why don't we pick a 
channel? the vw bus channel, any ideas? you could wave in advance!
