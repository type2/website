Subject: Re: [T2] Keeping a Manual Transmision Alive

My rebuilt transmission was acting (hard to shift into first gear when
stopped) up so I switched my tranny oil over to &quot;Redline&quot; brand synthetic
MT-90.  It made a significant difference for my transmission but the oil
isn't cheap.  It took about two weeks of driving for the improvement to
show.  It still isn't 100% but it is certainly more drivable now.  I wish
that I had used it from the start.

Cheers,
Drew
