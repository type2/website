Subject: Fuel filter origins

I've ordered a few fuel filters from several online vw vendors over the
months as part of larger orders for the hell of it and I assumed they were
all Bosch filters even through they say &quot;07711 Made in Israel 1115&quot;.

There are no Bosch marking and the boxes they come in are blank also.

Today in the local flaps I saw a Purolator filter, same shape, same markings
and the Purolator book confirmed this is their part # for a VW bus.

Does anyone know who makes this filter in Israel?
