Subject: Re: [T2] bleeding brakes off the ground

Dan, I had to go read that to see what you could be
referring to. I've never heard of that before. As it
would make no difference to the fluid, the calipers,
the wheel cylinders or any other part of the system,
the only thing I can think of is that there are
probably a lot of cars that would be difficult if not
impossible to access the bleeder screws with the
wheels on - or - they are taking that precaution to
avoid any possible leakage onto the wheels. It
certainly is not necessary on our vehicles.

In fact, if you drive your bus up on ramps and use a
check-valve type bleeder hose, you can tie a strap to
the brake pedal arm and lie down there and do it all
yourself with a little ingenuity! BaH

 and so neither have I ever removed all four wheels
 or
 put the lug nuts in backwards (whatever that means).
 What am I missing?

 fluid that made it so corrosive. ]
