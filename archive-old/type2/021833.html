&gt; Hi all.   On August 25th, I got my first bus - a 1974 Westy. (okay begin
&gt; laughing) Now, I've never really been mechanically inclined,

&lt;snip&gt;

&gt; Here's what wasn't done that they said needed to be: Tie Rod Ends, Outer
&gt; Axle Boot - right rear, front brake pads, front shocks, rear brake
&gt; adjusters and screws.  Oh and the replacing of the carbs (they said it
&gt; wasn't imperative at this moment but that I should really think about it).

Stepanie:
Congratulations on the 74 westy. Each year has good points, but 74 is a pretty
desirable year.
Most of this seems reasonable, but with a couple of notable exceptions:
1. did they adjust the valve lash? This is very important and must be done at
regular intervals .(I can't remember right now, but maybe 3000 miles? List?)
2. Replace the dual carbs with WHAT? Hardly anything else works as well, except
NEW dual carbs or rebushed ones, or fuel injection from a later bus.
I would almost base my continuing relationship with them on the basis of their
answers to the above two questions.
There is not much reason that a first time owner needs to learn how to change
shocks or tie rod ends. They should also change the brake hoses  if they are
more than 10 years old as well as the  rear adjusters.
You should get an owner's manual and learn how to do the lubrication and
maintenanace items shown there as a first step to learning more mechanical
stuff.
