Subject: points bounce?

What does it mean for the points to bounce?  I've read this several place but I'm not sure what it refers to.

I'm starting to understand the ignition system better.  With new points and the bus running well, a stroboscopic timing light shows that the engine sometimes doesn't always fire at 7.5 BTDC.  It's not regular but still happens and you can hear the engine timing change for that brief second as it fires a little later. Also, when the dwell is set too high starting is really hard. A lot of gas pumps in and there is a big stink when the engine finally starts.

As I understand it, electronic ignition smooths out both of these conditions: starting and idle.
