Subject: Oxy-Gas and more doom

  I was reading again and as always it means you ladies get the bad news.

 Seems the alcohol fuels create more acids when burnt which end up in
the oil where all nasty stuff goes.

 Mufflers and tail pipes are at risk also, catalytic converters.

 Still want to do those extended oil changes?

 But we'll all live longer right?  How come the fish died?
