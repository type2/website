&gt; The gauge is a VDO dual sender. If you have one please let me know which wire
&gt; went where (G or WK to the gauge or idiot lite).  Would the full flow
&gt; hoses/oil filter effect this?  How much pressure can be delivered by just the
&gt; starter turning the engine?  I'm also using 10W-40, per the sermon for the
&gt; breakin oil.  It has been cooler here ~ low 70's for a high.

my 2 liter will easily pump 30-40psi when cranked for 45-60seconds
with 5W-50 synthetic 

did 25+psi when cranking her before starting the first time, with stock
full flow filter (10W-40 dino Break in oil)

rebuilt engine with NEW Melling pump honed in
