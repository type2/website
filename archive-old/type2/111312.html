Subject: Re: [T2] Oil: Is my dad full of it??

The only thing you need to be concerned about when it
comes to oil is the weight, if it meets standards like
API SJ (basically every major oil manufacturer),
whether or not it contains detergents, if it is
synthetic or regular oil.  And that is it.  

On a side note related to oil, this is a pet peave of
mine, but if I hear another person (so far nobody on
this list) claim that Penzoil has wax in it and
Valvoline and the others do not, I'll scream.  It's
called Parrafin Wax a naturally occuring substance in
all petroleum based products.  It only starts to
harden in your engine if you leave it in for long
periods of time (over 3,000 miles).  Just needed to
get that out there...  :-)  Have a good one.  Good
luck on your trip.

Peace, Love, &amp; Happiness!!!
