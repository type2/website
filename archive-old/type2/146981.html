Subject: Brake booster connections?

Hi all...

I replaced my master cylinder and brake booster together last weekend. I 
broke the dang fluid reservoir that attaches to the master cylinder when 
taking it off...

this may be a good thing... i couldn't believe the sludge that came out 
of it!

While i've been waiting for a replacement i've been trying to trace the 
vacuum lines to the booster. My hope in replacing the parts is to get 
the power assist brakes to work... they haven't worked since as long as 
i've owned the bus. (and the booster was half full of fluid) I had 
thought that there was only one vacuum line going to (from?) the engine 
to the booster... the one that has the check valve. This line is good 
and I made sure to seal up the connection on the booster nicely. There 
is however another connection which is puzzling me. It connects to the 
front (FIF) of the booster (near the bellow and connector rod to the 
pedal). I followed it trough the frame right below the drivers seat, 
into and across the front wheel well... and then it appears to go into 
the cavity behind the front driver's side dogleg...... (&gt;&gt;&gt;?&lt;&lt;&lt;)

Bently refers to the connection as the &quot;air hose&quot; connection.... but i 
see no other mention of its purpose.

what the heck does it do? the old connection was not even close to air 
tight.... it was just one tube pushed into the other. should i get in 
there to check it out?

Also... i needed to replace the metal connecting rod to the brake pedal. 
Is there supposed to be any play in the brake pedal.  I adjusted it to 
the same length as before ... but there seems to be about 1/2 inch of 
play.... maybe I never noticed it before but its there... should it be 
nice and taught? will it go away when I get fluid in the system and it's 
bled?

thanks for the help
Eddie
