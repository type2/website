Hi,
As VW Canvas, in Austin TX, has gone out of business, can anyone =
recommend the best source for a replacement original style and colour =
canvas for my 73 Westy? I have looked at Mc Cullough's PopTops and PLF =
VW. What is Sunbrella, and how does it compare to the original canvas? =
Does it look proper?
