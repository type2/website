made a camper conversion a few weeks back.

&gt; I found some good pics of an 83 Adventurewagen for sale with only 20k
original miles. If you want to see the pics email me.

I've looked at '86 and '87 conversions.  So they go later than that,
came &quot;that close&quot; to buying the '87 but Dolan wisely talked me
out of it pointing out that even in the larger vanagon the interior
layout is still a bit cramped.  Also the woodwork though nice
to start doesn't hold up so well if it wasn't maintained, the '86
was gorgeous, the '87 was merely OK.  Anyway Adventurewagen
was still doing them to '87 (in retropect I've seen two '87s as I
saw a syncro converted '87 years ago)
