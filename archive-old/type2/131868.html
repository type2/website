Subject: Re: [T2] Ball Joints Revisited

That press in the Bentley is NOT standard.  You need a good 20k lb press for
that job.  a 45 will not even budge them, and i have the correct vw tools.
If you do not have the right press tools, forget it, too.

Best way is to order the arms with bushings installed from bus boys and send
the cores back............or get the ball joints and take them to a front
end shop and for about 150 they do it on the car.

I have done it several times, but it is a nasty difficult job, and without
the tools, you bust your ass to get the arms off, take them to a machinist,
he charges $110, and boom you saved nothing.  I have learned this lesson
before.   Cost/value.
