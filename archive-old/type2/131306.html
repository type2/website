Subject: Re: [T2] Some more pics of my 73 and Q about points grease.

&quot;My '72 uses a dual vacuum advance distributor.&quot;

DPO &quot;upgraded&quot; to a 009....

&quot;Also, where is your engine compartment seal?&quot;

Still at Bus Depot... I haven't ordered it yet... :(

I went to a &quot;VW Specialist&quot; FLAPS right after I bought the bus to get one. 
After explaining what I was looking for (15 minutes) the counter guy went 
through the Empi catalogs and another one looking for it. Couldn't find it, 
soe he called Empi. They said to use large vacuum hose. (Roll eyes here.)

It's on my next list of things to buy. The box of sheet metal behind the 
engine where the engine compartment door latches is also bent way in from 
DPO backing into a pole or something, so the door doesn't seal. Of course, 
VW needed to strengthen that area and changed from the easy to replace skirt 
used previously with a welded on section. Still trying to figure out how to 
fix that without a body shop. Plus, I need to find a way to block off the 
heater box ports (where the heater blower hoses connect).

Right now, I'm happy it runs. LoL
