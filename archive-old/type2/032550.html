Subject: RE: Pop top addition?

If only 2 people will be camping in the refitted bus, I'd strongly advise 
against installing the poptop.

We put 200,000 miles on a hardtop Westfalia Campmobile, camping all over the 
West, and the only time we _needed_ a poptop was when I dressed in the 
morning.  I _wanted_ a poptop, but rarely actually needed one.

Our present camper, a 1970 Campmobile, has a poptop.  On a typical overnight 
or weekend campout we raise the poptop only if the whole family (2 &quot;adults&quot; 
and a teenager) is aboard.

In my opinion the hassle and expense involved in retro-fitting a poptop to 
your bus just wouldn't be worth it.

The headroom in the interior area between the Z-bed and bulkheads behind the 
front seats could be maximized by remodeling the headliner/ceiling in that 
area, either permanently or with a removable arrangement of some sort.  Much 
easier and cheaper than sawing a hole in the roof and engineering 
reinforcements.

Purists are already groaning...oh well!
