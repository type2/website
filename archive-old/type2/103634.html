Now i'm really pissed.

Just for S &amp; G's I checked Brazil's VW site....I guess they still make the Bus
too.  I want one.

My P.O. is a grad student heading to mexico for a few months.

He's looking to pick up cheap vw transit, preferably bus, preferably in mexico
to be brought back to the US.

Can it be done?

How?

Thanks,

Billy
