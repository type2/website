&gt; Ok, ok -- what's all this math that you guys are doing? I understand
&gt; that in 185R14, the R stands for the width of the tire and the 14 is
&gt; the
&gt; size of the rim so the 185 is the diameter of the tire, I presume,
&gt; but
&gt; where are you getting these decimal numbers and what does it all
&gt; mean???!!!

14 is the size of the rim in inches.
185 is the width of the tread in millimeters.

The decimal number (.82, .75, .70, etc.) is the &quot;aspect ratio&quot; of the
tire.  This is the ratio of the tread width to the section height
(distance from rim to tread) of the tire.  The smaller the aspect
ratio, the &quot;squatter&quot; the tire.  If no aspect ratio is used, as in
&quot;185R14&quot;, then an aspect ratio of .82 is assumed.  If it's different,
then it's included in the tire size: &quot;195/75R14&quot;

Now, calculating the numbers to a gnat's eyelash is an interesting
intellectual exercise, but in reality tires need only fall into a range
of dimensions to get a particular &quot;nominal&quot; size.
