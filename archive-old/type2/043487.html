Subject: Starter removal for a 77 bus

&gt; I am looking for a bit of advise for the removal of a starter on my 77 bus.
&gt; I only have one bolt left to remove, it is the top bolt and I cant seem 
&gt; to locate it.

It's probably the same as in my '78. The bolt you want is one of the bolts
that goes through the bell housing on the engine. It's the top, passenger
side (right = right) bolt. Generally visible if you look, especially if you
lie down and look in through the top engine hatch. It's kind of under,
forward and to the right of the FI control box. It's big (at least 15mm and
maybe as big as 19mm). It's about 3-4&quot; long and it goes through the bell
housing of the engine, the bell housing of the transmission (maybe the
mouting bracket for the tranny on that side? I can't remember), through the
hole in the starter, and is secured by a big nut. The nut fits into a notch
and flat spot on the side of the starter that keeps it from turning. It's on
the top side of the starter, out of sight (unless you use a small mirror). 

I've done it myself before, but an assistant is helpful for putting it 
back in. You ought to be able to get it off by yourself because the nut 
is immobilized by the flat spot on the starter if you keep the nut pulled 
in as you back out the bolt. Going back in, an assistant either pushes 
the bolt through the holes, or holds the nut underneath while you push 
the bolt. Once the bolt is through and threaded, you pull it tight into 
the starter and the flat spot keeps it fast while you tighten the bolt. 

Then you get to hook up all those wires to the starter bolt, overhead, 
upside down, half blind, with dirt and crud falling in your eyes. But 
that's another story...

Good luck,
