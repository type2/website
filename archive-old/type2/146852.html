&gt; I had my mirror glass fall out when I closed my door one day.  It

&gt; break.  I ended up goop'ing it back in.

Next time this happens, make sure the nut behind
the mirror glass is tight!   I took my original
mirrors to a glazier a couple years ago for new
glass.  The silver had flaked off of the glass.
Recently, the left mirror would not stay aimed
in place because that nut behind the glass loosened.

So, until I can get back to the glazier, I put on
an asian made knock-off left door mirror from *Bay.
The good thing about that rusty pos is that it does
stay aimed.

&gt; My mirrors have been oriented long-side horizontal as long as I've known my
&gt; bus.

I recall both mirrors were 'portrait' when the car
was new.  In the '80s I was running the left one
'landscape' and the right one 'portrait'.  This gave
me the ability to see the right rear corner of the
bus while backing, and I could look into the #2 and
#1 lanes in the left mirror while driving in the
slow lane.  I'm back to running them both in the
'portrait' orientation.
