Subject: Re: [T2] Vanagon hydraulic clutch questions &amp; engine install

&gt; As with the brakes, the flex line can clog although this sounds more like
&gt; something has gone wrong in the clutch master to me.  As with brakes a
&gt; complete overhaul should include not only a new slave but a new master and
&gt; new flex line as well.

The clutch seemed to work fine before I pulled the engine. When I bought the 
bus the PO said the master cyl. had been replaced about 2 months prior. He 
warned me that the slave cylinder had started leaking. When I got the bus 
home I pulled the slave and put a rebuild kit in it but the cylinder was 
quite pitted. It worked ok for the few weeks before I pulled the engine. 
With the engine out I decided it was too easy to replace the slave with all 
that room. Put new slave in and used a vacuum pump to blead the line. I 
wonder now if this was the wrong way to go? I checked the archives and found 
a post saying that Bentley says to pressure blead only. Checked my book and 
found no reference to this. What do you think?

&gt; My imagination of what you are describing and your description match,
&gt; though that does not mean very much.  it certainly wraps on the throwout
&gt; crosshaft before the lever is attached to the crosshaft and hooks onto
&gt; the lever, yes.  It shoudl also have some pre-tension on it.
&gt;
&gt; Now that I read this far, however, if the return spring is not in place
&gt; then there may not be anything wrong with the hydraulics at all[1].  That
&gt; spring exerts a considerable force!

Return spring? What return spring? Now I'm realy nervous! It wasn't there 
when I pulled every thing apart. Took a break from writing this and checked 
both Bentley manuals (80 to 81 and 80 to 85 revised) Page 30-2 does not show 
a return spring at the clutch lever, only at the pedal. Is that the return 
spring you speak of or is there supposed to be one on the clutch lever also 
like my 75?
