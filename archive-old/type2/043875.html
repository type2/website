use a deep socket that fits thru the splined hole. i forget how i did it, but seems
you need to reduce the end to the smaller i.d. of the pilot bearing, maybe use
a socket extension and eyeball the fit... a spare trans input shaft is the perfect tool.
a new sachs clutch kit usually includes a plastic tool, also available at local flaps.
