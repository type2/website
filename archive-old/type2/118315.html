OK, I still have mechanical points too. I check them every 1500 miles with
the valves lol. Dwell rarely is off by more than a couple degrees...

&gt; I see endless discussions and debate on the list about bleeding
&gt; down/adjusting/installing hydrualic lifters...it seems like way more of a
&gt; pita than it's worth. I had AVP keep my solids. My 2 cents...

only two things ever really bugged me about owning a VW and that was
constantly having to adjust the valves and points.   I have never had any
real problems with my adjusters bleeding down, but mine is a daily
driver,  so I lovee my hyd and when I rebuilt the engine there was no
discussion, it was hyd for sure and have not regretted it, oh and I also
have a pertronix points eliminator too.  so it's good to go
