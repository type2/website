&gt;The ideal solution!!!  Please, someone with stock dual carbs, go and have
&gt;a look!

Okay, okay!  :-)

&gt; &gt; Ohhhh, now my head hurts.  I was feeling very comfortable with the top
&gt; &gt; port (on the right of the carb) attaching to the advance on the dizzy.
&gt; &gt; And the other vacuum port attaching to the lower one (on the left of
&gt; &gt; the carb).

That's correct, assuming that the other port you refer to is the slightly 
larger diameter one, that actually points slightly forward.  It should go 
to the dizzy retard, which is the port on the flat, inner face of the 
canister.  The port on the right side of the left carb (or left side of the 
right carb, for that matter) should go to the vacuum advance on the dizzy, 
which is the port on the outer, slanted surface of the canister.

&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; My concern all along is that there is this other port, which appears
&gt; &gt; to be vacuum and is currently capped off, below the air cleaner
&gt; &gt; assembly on the thing that connects the two carbs.  Now I'm not sure
&gt; &gt; that even the advance vacuum line is correct.

That is the thermostatic valve that operates the flap to switch intake air 
from hot to cold and back.  There are actually two connections there, one 
of which goes to the control box in the right-front and the other attaches 
to vacuum.  I say only &quot;vacuum&quot; because I'm not 100% sure which type of 
vacuum it connects to, but I *think* it would be teed into the manifold 
vacuum, i.e. what goes to the vacuum retard on the dizzy that we just 
talked about.  When it's cold out, the thermostatic valve opens and allows 
vacuum to &quot;pass through&quot; and pull the flap in the control box open which 
allows preheated air to enter the air box.  Got all that?  Whew.  :)
