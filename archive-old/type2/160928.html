Subject: Cooling tins, take 4

Ok guys (and gals), I got the bus home today, no problems. I did have some
unpleasant surprises when I looked under the engine. No mustache bar. No
heat exchangers. No cylinder tins. The, ahem, cooling tin metal is held on
by CLOTHESLINE, and simply sways to and fro at will. And the PO tells me the
installer had to shorten the transmission shaft to get the 1600 to work. I
don't know whether to be mad or laugh about it. The people I bought the bus
from were super nice, so somebody really must have seen them coming. Think
about it. Installing a rebuilt dual port 1600 engine in a 2.0 (while keeping
the 2.0 and all the nice expensive goodies), eliminating the heating system,
totally hacking the cooling tins, and charging $2,200 to do so. Unreal. The
body is mainly straight except for some bad damage behind the drivers rear
wheel. Altogether much less rust and body dings and damage than I have seen
in numerous unrestored buses. But the interior made up for it. Awesome.
Everything is in really great shape. No loose veneer anywhere. The seat
covers look great. The headliner isn't even dingy. And the old girl had
factory air conditioning, and still has all the bits except the compressor.
I am thinking more and more about just doing short trips in it, and going
ahead and pulling the 2.0, overhauling it, and putting it and the tranny in
the new bus instead of making the 1600 work like it should.
