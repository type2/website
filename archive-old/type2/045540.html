Subject: Re: [T2] What's this funny part on my 1.8L Type 4?

Wow!
that's so funny that you asked this question.  I was just thinking about
that today.  A few days ago I was working with my dad taking apart my
other engine and we came across that part.  It still had the plug on it,
so I pulled it out.  My dad guessed that it was for the vw diagnostic
computer hookup.  I'm guessing that there's a magnet imbedded on the
flywheel and that tells rpm to the computer hookup.  That's the only
thing I can think of.

In other words, I have two FIs, and neither of them  have it hooked up
to anything.

later,
Mike

&gt; Having removed China Cat's engine and partly broken it down, I've come across
&gt; a part I can't find in the manuals. Can someone help me identify it please?
&gt; 
&gt; It is a black plastic cone in the upper right side of the case flange,
&gt; penetrating the flange from the rear into the flywheel area. The cone is
&gt; appx. 12mm diameter X 32 mm high. It appears that there was once a cable or
&gt; wire through the center of the cone, but that is now cut off.
&gt; 
&gt; The engine was converted from FI to a Weber, so I expect that this is a
&gt; sensor of some sort used by the FI. Since I will be converting back to FI
&gt; someday, if not immediately, I want to replace all the sensors while I have
&gt; the engine out.
