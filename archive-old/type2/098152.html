Subject: Re: [T2] TypeIV Thermostat Question

Hello Tom,
  Busdepot stocks the type 2 thermostate for about $49.00 plus shipping.
If they do not have it and you can get the parts number VW can still
order them for about $53.00 including tax=== Tn tax 9.5%. If you need the
number let me know and I will look for it. I recently ordered one.
