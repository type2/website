Subject: Fw: [T2] POR 15 yes or no

I brushed por-15 onto my heater boxes after meticulously cleaning them, and
as long as rocks or other debris do not scratch any of the por off, it keeps
them from rusting.  By the way I did it about 4 years ago.  My heater boxes
still look very good and the only reason I would not recommend por-15 is
that it is a pain in the ass to apply, and no one in the house is your
friend when you're baking engine exhaust parts in the oven.
