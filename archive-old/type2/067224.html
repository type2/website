Markus:
I'm not sure a 1641 is a good idea. The increase in displacement is achieved 
by using cylinders with thinner walls, and such cylinders don't last as 
long. My last rebuild, which resided in my 70 Westy, was a 1641, I'd say I 
got about 8,000 miles out of it before something horrible happened. I don't 
exactly know what, as it's still sitting on my bench waiting to be 
dissected. If you want more displacement, you should bore the case to accept 
larger jugs.

Hi,

I'm contemplating a top-end rebuild for my '66 (might split the case, but
only
for recreation) and was wondering about the trade-offs.

I'm pretty happy with the performance of the bus as it is now (1600 dp) but
I'm pretty
sure she's stressing on the hills.  Would a 1641 make a noticible difference
with respect
to hills?  I'd likely stay with stock carb.

Would mileage change either way?

My goal is a reliable engine, not a rocket (yeah, like thats possible...)

I'd appreciate some comments either way.

Thanks,
...Markus
