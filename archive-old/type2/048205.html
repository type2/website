&gt; &gt; You CAN use the self-supprting automatic starter in 1700 and 1800 manual
&gt; &gt; trans buses. You CANNOT use it in a 2.0L manual trans bus.
&gt;
&gt; we have been &quot;discussing&quot; this for a long time, I'm not stepping into that
&gt; mess again.

Not sure what you mean by this.......   The 210mm [1700] and 215mm [1800]
flywheels have the ring gear at the outer edge. The 228mm [2.0L] flywheel
have the ring gear at the inner edge. The teeth on the auto starter will not
reach the teeth on the 228 flywheel. To see this difference on manual
starters: get a 1700/1800 starter and a 2.0L starter. Lay them next to each
other and compare the pinion gear on the starter drive. On the 1700/1800
drive, the teeth will be right at the sprague clutch. On the 2.0 drive, you
will see a 1/2&quot; blank section between the teeth and the sprague clutch.
