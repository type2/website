Subject: 009/points

I have read that you should always make sure your point are adjusted correctly 
before attempting to set timing. I have this 009 dizzy on my 69 and haven't 
seen any literature on whether this particular dizzy requires different points 
gapping/what is gap, the Bentley doesn't have it. Nothing I've seen on the 
oldvolkshome site has it or maybe I've overlooked it. Or are the adjustment 
procedures and points gap all the same? .016 gap right?
