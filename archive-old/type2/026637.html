HI,  I know it's not Friday, but I was unable to get to my email till this
morning...anyway...I couldn't let this go by...

Last weekend, As I was driving in a city in MD (don't want anyone to start
pointing fingers) I saw a lovely White and orange Westy a couple of cars
ahead of me.  Then something tragic almost happened, a little extra speed, a
failure to yield at a traffic circle, and non-antilock brakes came close to
extinguishing the light of one of these wonderful vehicles.  If the oncoming
car had not of been as quick with the brake as they where several people
would have been hurt, and there would be one more &quot;parts car&quot; and one less
bus sighting.

PLEEEEEEASE be careful out there!!!!!  Keep in mind that these treasures do
not come with &quot;anti-lock brakes&quot; and precision steering.  They are not your
5-star safety rated mini-van.  They are not sports cars.  Most aren't off
road vehicles. They will not corner like they are on rails, and they
certainly wont stop on a dime.  They truly are not your typical automobile.
These vehicles are becoming harder and harder to find.  I'm sure if you
don't want to take care of the beauty there are others out here that will.



On a lighter note.

This Thursday was an incredible bus sightings day here in DC!  Five
busses!!! I went to the national zoo and parked in Adams Morgan, walking
down Adams Mill road I saw a Double Cab parked near a Bug.  After the Zoo I
was tooling through Takoma Park, MD and saw a red and white Transporter at a
shop, a orange and white one parked on the street (not the same on as
above...different city), then on the way home on the Inner Loop, A Green
Westy going a pretty good clip...after we got out of the traffic.  And at
the same time saw a white-ish transporter with an extended roof buzzing the
Outer Loop of the beltway!  So if any of you are reading this then...HIYA!
I was in UberBus, the white westy on the inner loop.  It's was great seeing
that many busses at one time at a non event. :)
