Subject: Re: [T2] Headlight voltage

Richard,

The only way to tell is to hook up a VOM and inspect the connections.  If
your idle speed is steady and the voltage at the fuse block is not steady,
then the VR (or battery!) is dying.  If both lights are flickering in
time, I would look to the headlight switch.  If only one is flickering, I
would look to its connections.  Look at the ground first, because that is
the more &quot;usual suspect.&quot;
