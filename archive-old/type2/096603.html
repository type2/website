Subject: Re: [T2] Kerosene: Friday

HI Folks,
	It does my heart good to see us all keeping our busses/cars
running. I have read that it takes between 3 and 5 times as much fuel and
resources to build a car as it will use in it's lifetime.  No matter how
many miles per gallon your new car gets, it is an unbeatable equation to
keep an old one running.  Keep it up list.
	On burning kerosene in the open.  It amazes me how folks will get
really fussed about a small back yard burn when, for example, the Trans
Alaska Pipeline burns about 500,000 gallons per day to push the oil
through the line (~20 pump stations, each with two Avon jets burning
20,000 gallons per day-yeah, I know they are clean burning, but it is
still 500Kgal PER DAY). Each trans-continental/international 747 takes off
with 200+ tons of kerosene on board and comes down with not much.  The
fuel that is drained from airliner tanks to check for water every day
would probably keep this entire list going for years in terms of gross
petroleum products. None of that is directly returned to aircraft service.
	I do my part to minimize waste and am particularly conscious of
refined/mixed products, benzene, toluene (carb cleaner ingredient),
acetone etc. but disposing of a few gallons of dirty kerosene here and
there in a burn barrel is not something to punish someone about IMHOP.
Far better than dumping it on the ground. Re-refining of waste petroleum 
products should be supported and even subsidized if necessary to keep them
out of the ground.
