&gt; 10 ft-lbs seems awfully low.
&gt; 
&gt; I replaced the pushrod tube seals in my '72 1700 T-IV this weekend.  I checked
&gt; the torque spec on the rocker arm mounting nuts and Muir says it is 10 ft-lbs
&gt; on the T-IV.  This seems awfully low, infact, I could hardly notice the
&gt; &quot;click&quot; on my torque wrench.
&gt; 
&gt; How will these not loosen?  What is the group tought on this?

That is the spec. you need two things going for you to make this work.

First off, replace the nuts &amp; wave washers with new ones. These are slightly
hard to find, though I have heard a rumor that certain on-line vendors might
have them. Be careful over-tightening the nuts, for a few reasons. The studs
are NLA, for one, so if you strip them, and they are fairly easy to strip,
you will have to find some in a core head, or go to oversize studs from FAT
performance (the only source I know for new TIV rocker studs)
Over-tightening can also lead to the studs pulling clean out of the head,
which is even worse. Don't forget that as the engine heats up, the torque
values can increase with parts expansion.

Also you need a torque wrench that is within its spec range at 10 ft-lbs.
Most torque tools are rated to accuracy between 20% and 100% of torque
range, which means a wrench that is rated to near 10 ft-lbs at the low end
of the scale may be very inaccurate at this torque. You need a very small
ft-lbs wrench or an inch-lbs wrench for this job. Unfortunately you cannot
do all the fasteners on an engine with one torque wrench, the range is too
broad.
