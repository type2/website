&gt;Note: If you consult Steve Dolan at the end of his trip you may find that
&gt;finding Internet access became just as important as finding honest
&gt;mechanics/friendly listees. You can get it at Kinko's but is ain't cheap.

Those of you who have laptops will find that you can plug them in at (most
if not all) Kinko's for free, including phone line; they give that service
away because they expect most people who use it to print something (which
costs). If it's not crowded and you don't take too long you should be in
the clear.
