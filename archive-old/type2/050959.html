thanks is an understatement! bad ground on the tranny strap, eh? i'll
recheck. i thought that earlier too, and ran a heavy ground from the
chassis to the generator stand. maybe it wants the braided ground scraped
better at the tranny.
gas lines at the pump on mine are - lower is fuel from tank, above is going
to the carb. is that not right? the base is hard to compare - no spares,
and this i my first type 1 engine; i'll have to remove it to see the part
number. tranny i left in neutral. the bus was rolling and blocked before
tranny removal. clutch has an inch of play at the pedal. clutch throwout,
plate, etc., all came from previous 002 tranny and current engine. no
changes made at clutch. hail'p - steve

&gt;Last year, a few weeks after I first got my '70 on the road, I was unable to
&gt;turn it over one day after work.  I initially thought the starter was the
&gt;problem but a new starter didn't help.  Like you, I noted that the lights
&gt;worked and the battery was fully charged.  The problem, after much
&gt;frustration, turned out to be a bad ground on the tranny.
&gt;
&gt;If you aren't getting gas, I would suspect that you have the lines hooked up
&gt;to the pump backwards, or the pump is defective, or you have a pump rod from
&gt;an alternator style pump (the base of the pump is shorter so the rod has to
&gt;be shorter).
&gt;
&gt;As for the tranny being stuck in gear, are you the one who talked about
&gt;leaving the shift lever in gear when attaching the linkage?  If so, I
&gt;remember thinking at the time, that you should hook it up while everything
&gt;is in neutral.  I'm thinking that your tranny is on one side of the H
&gt;pattern and your shift lever is on the other and there isn't enough free
&gt;play to allow it to get into neutral.  Other possibilities are that maybe
&gt;your clutch cable isn't adjusted right or you have the wrong throwout
&gt;bearing for the style of clutch plate you are using.
&gt;
&gt;I'm just trying to think of all the stupid things I've done over the years
&gt;and maybe I can help you get one step closer to getting it on the road.

&gt;&gt; the vehicle won't start. there is new gas in it, and i had to toke on it
&gt;&gt; to
&gt;&gt; get fuel into the pump. however, gas isn't making it to the carb. and the
&gt;&gt; tranny is still stuck in some gear - not neutral, which makes
&gt;&gt; hand-cranking
&gt;&gt; the engine difficult. so everytime i try to start it i have to use clutch.
&gt;&gt; wondering what is related, if whether it is the regulator, igition switch,
&gt;&gt; both, neither. - steve
