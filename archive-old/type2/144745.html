Subject: Re: [T2] what the kids are doing these days

I think there's a lot of good bus progeny waiting to fill our shoes on this
list.

My boys love the bus.  My oldest drew hydraulic diagrams while I swapped
transmissions on my old '65.
They open my busdepot shipments and analyze part quality for me.

It's a good match, buses/kids.

&gt; &gt; We can only all hope to have kids that interested and sharp!!!
&gt; &gt; Mine is enthusiastic enough but he's going to have to learn to
&gt; &gt; read before Muir is of any value to him... (5 yrs old).

&gt; Even without linguistic skills, those small fingers are useful...A small
&gt; child wedged
&gt; between the firewall and gas tank is often a lot easier than dropping the
&gt; engine
&gt; to replace a fuel sender...Be creative...!! ;-)
