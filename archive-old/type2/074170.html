Subject: 1974 Westy fluorescent lamp fuse?

Hello,
    I'm new to this list so please bear with me.  Is there an archive of =
common technical questions somewhere?  Does anyone know of a wiring =
diagram (preferably online) of the &quot;house circuit&quot; for  a 1974 Westy.  I =
am pretty sure I blew the fuse  when the hot wire and ground wire got =
together today but I can't find the sucker.  Please enlighten me.
                                                                         =
                  Thanks,
                                                                         =
