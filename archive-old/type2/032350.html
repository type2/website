Subject: Anyone looking for a project bus in MI?

Was coming up US-131 from Grand Rapids and decided to stop in Rockford for
lunch.  On the rise a little bit before you get into town, there's a white
bus for sale.  Sign claims it's a '71; that looks about right to me.  I
didn't inspect it close, just a quick walk-around, but the body is in
pretty good shape -- almost no rust.  Amazing, for Michigan.  It's a
pop-top, but the interior is gone, stripped down to the metal.  The real
kicker, though, is that someone stuffed a '75 Pinto engine in the back,
then apparently lost interest in finishing the conversion.  Looks like
it's just hanging there on an adapter, the body hasn't been cut for a
radiator or anything.  They wanted what I thought was too much for a
non-runner ($700) but if you're looking for a straight, mostly rust-free
body and you can talk them down a bit this might be the ticket.
