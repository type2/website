First, I would like to thank everyone that has helped me until this point, THANKS!!  
This weekend I did some work on my non-running bus.  The bus was turning over very slow.  So before troubleshooting any electrical stuff I changed the starter and soleniod.  I have a non-feul injection parts bus, my bus is FI, and a spare trany that had the starter still attached by one bolt to the trany housing.  To save myself some time, so I thought, I remove the starter from the trany housing and put it into my bus.  I did notice that the soleniod was just a little different.  It had two posts, one above the other located on the outside diameter of the soleniod.  The one I removed from my bus also had two posts but they were side by side.  As a result, when I turn the key to start the bus, the starter enganges and cranks the engine, when I release the key the starter continues to crank, even if I turn the bus off??  I then have to remove the negative battery cable to stop the starter from cranking.  Does the FI and non-FI have different soleniods?? Please help..I'm also lo!
oking for a wiring diagram, sugg
estion of Sean, to trouble shoot my bus completely..78' sunroof bus, without points? 
Thanks Mike
