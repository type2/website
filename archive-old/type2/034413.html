Subject: valve stem seals

Sorry for the repeat question.  A month or so ago, I asked if the
installation of valve stem seals on a 1776 was considered a good idea.  I
bought them as a shot in the dark to cure a severe oil usage problem on a
new rebuild that included a pair of expensive Berg heads.

The response to that original post was mixed. Most were in the &quot;it can't
hurt&quot; category. But one warned me that the presence of the seals could
starve the valve stems of lubrication that they need as they stroke in the
guides.

I'm ready to bolt the heads on and I have one more chance to consider seals
and I'm looking for any reports of actual experience with them.

My questons:
1. Has anyone run an engine with valve stem seals for, say, several tens of
thousands of miles?
2. Are these seals used on engines other than our air cooled ones?

Thanks in advance.
Jack
