I MUST sell these buses so I'm dropping the prices as low as I can go

1976 Westy, School bus yellow..Interior in Excellent Condition. Under
10,000 Miles on New Breaks, New Engine, New Am/Fm Cassesette and
Speakers. all the interior is original plaid. Exterior: Rust here and
ther but nothing to major...no holes or anything. It's a beautiful Bus
and Runs Great! The sink works and has an ice box. Top Bed and Pop top
canvas in great condition. MUST SELL ASAP! $4000

1974 Westy, Orange, Body in good condition except where it was
rearended. It is not that bad. It looks like it can be easily fixed. It
has a new paint job, new engine, and it runs great. I just had a new
clutch put in. It needs: new pop top canvas, front a rear carpet. The
back bed is in excellent condition as well as the top bed. The sink and
Stove are not hooked up but supposely they work. I bought this to save
it from being traded in to a dealer. I'm having to sink to much money
in my bus and I must sell these buses. Email me if interested. If
someone is interested in two buses for one price..I'll let them go as a
pair for $6000

Thanks,

Greg
