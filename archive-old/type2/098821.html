Subject: Re: [T2] Mix in gas tank

i would assume adding oil to the gas is like adding water to milk when
you dont have enough milk left over and cant get to the store right away
or cant afford to... it just prolongs what you have. although oil here
isnt cheaper than gas per gallon, so it wouldnt do much good for me.
