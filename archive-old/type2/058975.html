Subject: Repairing ceiling vinyl

Hello all,
  When I wrote last I was undecided as to whether to support my
husbands' idea of restoring a '67 deluxe.  I have since then decided
that we should GO FOR IT!  One way or another we've got to put a small
chunk of change into a new vehical--why not a bus?
  So, now I'm involved with cleaning up the interior while Dave works on
the motor.  The whole back interior is gone, so I'm cleaning up about 8
years of grime and gunk.  A little daunted by starting on the floor, I
decided to clean up the ceiling vinyl.  It had some mildew around the
edges, but cleaned up quite nicely with some 409.   After cleaning it
up, it's almost perfectly white and only has a few very small tears.  My
question is this...what is the least conspicuous way to repair the
tears.  With such little damage to the whole ceiling, it seems to me
it'd be more desirable to have the original viny.  I am thinking of
patches done with a matching fabric tape.  Stitches are kinda out
because the vinyl is too brittle.  Any ideas?  Also, do you think if I
used some mink oil or saddle soap on the vinyl, would it help bring back
a little elasticity?
  Thanks for any advice.
