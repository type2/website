Subject: Trip and oil air cleaner...

Well Getting ready to drive my 69 bus up to Cache Creek and do some
camping and river tubing... Two questions:

1. Are there any other mailing list for vw buses I can subscribe to?
2. How much oil should you put in the air cleaner that hooks up to the
top of the carb.

Thanks...

Greg
