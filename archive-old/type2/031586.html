&gt; &gt; 2) What is the best way to haul a 16' canoe on the top of this pig?  ive been told both the little foam blocks as well as the yakima racks?  Any opinions?  We intend to pack the luggage rack w/ gas cans, etc... so i don't think the blocks will cut it.
&gt; 

well I've been carrying my 17ft alum as follows for many years.

bought some foam pipe insulation and some fabric ratcheting tie downs at
home depot.

. the pipe insulation is cut to fit over the gunwales, slip em on.
. put canoe flush against the roof on the foam covered gunwales.  mine
fits almost perfectly flush.
. put small clevis throught hole on bow and stern ends (not all canoes
have this hole) 
. put hooks of tie downs into clevis.
. have a couple of small pieces of stainless flat with two holes one I put
the bumper mount bolt through, other hole gets the other end of the tie
downs.  one on each corner.
. canoe has over 200,000 miles like that on several buses (and other
things) with never a problem.

KISS.
