Subject: Re: [vanagon] valves adjusted(sorta..) now a final VERY
  IMPORTANT question

Paul,

Read this saved message I have in my own archives--
It makes it all really simple to figure out---
Just remember--TDC
If you have done bikes and other cars, this job is no different--
Later,

Terry

  
did i just do my valves wrong and had the timing seriously off, or...? 
I keep seeing people trying to adjust valves using the distributor when
it is in the wrong position. Forget all that goofy crap way of doing it
by turning the engine backwards and trying to remember which ones to do.
The EASIEST way to do it is with a remote starter button and not
worrying where the distributor is. Takes longer to R + R the valve
covers then to adjust them!: 
Remove both covers. 
Connect a remote starter to the solenoid. Watch ANY pair of rockers. 
Turn engine over with remote. 
Just as the exhaust valve starts to open, STOP. Adjust the intake. 
Turn engine, exhaust will open and close, intake will open and close.
Just as the intake closes, STOP. 
Adjust the exhaust.
Go to the next cylinder. 
As the exhaust just starts to move, adjust the intake. When the intake
just closes, adjust the exhaust. Real simple, real quick, real easy. 
The valve you are adjusting will always be on the heel of the cam. 
When you are done and before you put the covers back on, you can check
the position of the distributor. 
Turn engine in direction of rotation and watch #3 valves. When the
exhaust opens and then just closes, STOP. At the instant the exhaust
closes the intake will start to open. You want the valves to be at
'rocking' position, either way you move the crank one valve will move.
This is TDC to fire #1. Look at your crank pulley. If you have a zero
degree mark, it will be at zero. Your rotor should be at the index mark
also. [a high lift or long duration or high overlap cam makes no
difference, rocking valves is rocking valves] If you are NOT at TDC zero
mark when the valves are rocking, your cam timing is OFF.
