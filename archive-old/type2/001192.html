&gt; Also consistent with Brian's observation about spot checking is the
&gt; Postal Service's verbiage: &quot;is subject to U.S. Customs examination&quot;.
&gt; That's not the same as if they said it WILL be examined.


Importing a *small* order for personal use, say one each of a handful of
items, and having it shipped via Mail rather than UPS, will probably not be
problematical.  But if you import in any quantity that would appear to be
for multiple people (i.e. viewed as potentially for resale or distribution),
your risk increases dramatically that they will spot-check your shipment,
particularly if you have not imported many times before.

This spot-check can be extremely involved.  Imagine being called in for a
detailed IRS audit, and you get the picture.  You pray it won't happen to
you, and if it does, you hope the auditor is in a good mood that day,
because even if you have nothing whatsoever to hide, it will be a huge and
expensive hassle.  Customs can totally disassemble your order, check each
item individually, and require detailed documention of value, composition,
and country of origin on each item.  You are responsible for the cost of
getting the goods to the Customs department facility and back, and providing
any documentation that they require. While the goods are there, only
specially bonded individuals are allowed to move or handle them, at your
expense of course.  If Customs determine that other government agencies
should be involved, it can get even worse.  For example, seat cushions for a
car would have to receive D.O.T. approval, so now you've got a second agency
getting involved and asking for a whole new slew of documentation. Every
little thing is legislated, down to the permissable types of adhesives used
to hold a product together, so it really comes down to how microscopic they
want to go.  By the time you pay a broker to handle all of this for you, you
can be out some serious time and money even if they finally determine that
everything is &quot;kosher.&quot;

Then there are the duties, brokerage, and handling fees. The former can vary
depending on how Customs classifies the item, and the latter can vary
dramatically depending on the carrier. Best way to keep this down is to have
the shipper use Mail rather than private carrier, since it is then a
government-to-government transaction with little or no hidden costs. At the
other extreme, the worst can be some commercial freight carriers, which can
nickle and dime you to death until your landed cost is many times the
originally quoted shipping cost.  Everybody who ever touched your shipment
along the way, or had a bill of lading for it go through their hands, stands
in line to take a few bucks out of your pocket before delivery - the company
that runs the docks at the origin point, the equivalent company at the U.S.
docks, the shipping company itself, the broker, the loading crew that took
the box off the boat, the warehouse that stored the box for a day between
when it got off the boat and when it got picked up by the delivery truck,
etc. etc. etc. - all adding their own surcharge to the actual shipping
price, to be collected C.O.D.  To give you an example, the ocean freight
itself from Europe to the U.S. on my last import shipment cost me about
$700. That is, just the transportation over the ocean, nothing else. By the
time all of the above costs were added, I had to cut the forwarder a
combined check for about $3000.

So the best bet is to order relatively small quantities for personal use and
try to specify Mail as the shipping method (or as a distant second choice,
some private carrier that is at least somewhat reputable, such as UPS). This
should minimize the likelihood of hassles or hidden costs along the way,
increasing the chances that your final cost is relatively close to what you
budgeted between the cost of goods, shipping, and duty.  Otherwise, it's a
crapshoot. Your order probably will sail right through, completely
hassle-free and inexpensively - or not.
