I hope your problem is all solved by now. I haven't had a chance to read
the list email so my response is a little slow. 

I disagree with most others on the list when it comes to oil temps. I
think your doing it right with a temp sensing dip stick and not a oil temp
gauge. Oil temp gauges should not be trusted. And Oil temps should never
get to the 240o range where some seem to run them constantly. A occasional
225o temp (the temp where the light comes on from the dip stick
gauge) when going up a big hill for a short time won't do any lasting
damage, as long as cools down quickly after that. I can't
prove it but i believe running an engine at any more then 225o would lead
to an engine lasting 50K miles or less. 

I'm replying because after reading all the replays to your post none of
them mentioned the one thing you haven't mentioned you've changed
already. Compression ratio. After changing everything else and still not
having temps low enough, i would if i where you pull the engine, take off
the heads, find out what my compression ratio is (not even sure how to do
that), I'm betting its currently over 7:1. I would lower it to 6.5:1. I 
also seem to be alone on this argument too, I never hear of anyone
building engines with compression this low,(except berg) but i never head
of anyone getting 100K miles out of there rebuilt vw engines anymore
either. You can do this with Cylinder spacers. 

If you already know your exact compression ratio and it's lower then
6.5:1, then i really have no idea. 

Oh here are a few good things to read from gene berg.

http://www.geneberg_dot_com/engrec.htm
http://www.geneberg_dot_com/tempdipstickhtm.htm
http://www.geneberg_dot_com/cylspacing.htm
http://www.geneberg_dot_com/gauges.htm
http://www.geneberg_dot_com/techtips.htm

you mite want to order GB 801-COOLING and GB 801-CR. They should have more
info on how to solve your problem.

Some people disagree with gene berg, but is hard to argue with a man who
regularly gets 200K miles out of his rebuilt engines, and runs 12
second 1/4 miles in beetle he drives daily. If anyone can do the same and
has as many years experience as the bergs do, Then i wouldn't argue with
there advice either.
