I also, did the online request and got a response saying the microfiche was 
too fragile to get the information I requested.  I sent the DM equivalent of 
the dollars requested to the museum w/ correct postage and I got the 
certificate back in a few weeks or so.  I put a frame around it and It is a 
great addition to my nearly original 1976 Deluxe Campmobile.
