Subject: Re: [T2] Engine lid removal?

the only one I have removed was from and early 76 and if I remember the
hinge was attached with a screws to the body. But they did change them so
some are welded but I dont know if it was ealy one that were welded or the
later ones.

&gt;  The rear hatch will be an easy replacement, but looking at
&gt; the engine lid, it looks like the hinges and hinge pins are welded in.
Has
&gt; anybody replaced the engine lid on a 72-79 bus?  If so, do I really need
to
&gt; cut metal to remove the old one and weld in the replacement?  Is there an
&gt; easier way?
