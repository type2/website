&gt; My ever-bus-patient wife bought me a nice stereo for my birthday to put
&gt; in my bus.  Since the bus has no accessory position for the key switch,
&gt; is there a way to wire it to the ignition with out leaving the key
&gt; on(don't want to burn that coil).  I was thinking there should be some
&gt; way to wire it to the on position for the key, for normal operation, and
&gt; with a switch for listening while the key is off, camping.  My current
&gt; radio is hot wired, and it's kind of a pain to turn it off and on all
&gt; the time, especially around town.

This is tricky, since you don't want current feeding back from the &quot;aux&quot;
switch to the ignition.  You could do it with a diode if the current
handling capacity of the diode was sufficient to handle the stereo. 

You
run power from a ignition-switch-controlled fuse through a diode to the
positive input of the radio.  You then run power from an always-hot fuse
through the switch to the radio side of the diode.

The diode prevents current from feeding back to the switched side of the
fuse block when the aux switch is on.

You could also work up some sort of relay arrangement to do the same
thing.

I ended up just wiring my radio hot and using its internal switch to turn
it on and off.  Be cautions, though, that some radios pull a lot of
current to run backlighting for a clock even when turned off.  This can
run your battery down if they are wired to an &quot;always hot&quot; terminal.
