Subject: &lt;F&gt; Tires, Oil, GL5, 009, MMO - LONG!

Just kidding! Just Kidding!

1915DP.

I installed a dual Oil Pressure (one terminal for PSI and one for the Oil 
Idiot light) sender. Haven't wired the PSI side to a gauge yet, but the 
Idiot light is wired.

When warm, the idiot light comes on solid at anything less than 1200rpm. I 
think the new sender need adjusting, because the old sender didn't do that.

What's the prescribed method for this?
