&gt;Rio Grande Tools sells metric drills in 0.10mm steps. You
&gt;could go 5 over or under.
&gt;
&gt;A Speed Shop might sell 0.050mm step drills.
&gt;
&gt;Or you can use standard number drills. A #55 drill will get
&gt;you 132 (1.32mm, 0.0520&quot;); #71 will get 66 (0.66mm,
&gt;0.0260&quot;); #76 will get 51 (0.51mm, 0.0200&quot;).

A word of caution:  many bits will drill an oversize hole.  Hand drilling
makes it worse.  Small bits in a cheap set are occasionally (often?)
mislabeled as to size.  Solution:  drill hole in scrap metal, find bit with
shank that will *just* fit, measure bit with micrometer.
