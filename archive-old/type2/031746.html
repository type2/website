&gt; &gt; HOWEVER I have my t-stat and the flaps are set up correctly but they are
&gt; &gt; disconected with the cable off because I do not have the stock heat system
&gt; &gt; so there are no exchangers and tin under the cyl.  the lowest piece of tin
&gt; &gt; on the engine is the &quot;forgotten&quot; piece above the push rod tubes.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; without all the containment I am concerned that it won't get hot enough in
&gt; &gt; that area, moving air flow and all.  I don't have any way to effectively
&gt; &gt; test it, so I have erred on the side of caution leaving the air flow at
&gt; &gt; max.
&gt; 
&gt; I find it funny that people think that their engines &quot;cool&quot; better without
&gt; the factory tin.  The flaps and thermostat are for more than heat they are
&gt; to warm up the engine as others have stated.

there is no tin missing above the engine seal and all air flows over the
cyl as intended.

&gt; those lowest pieces of tin protect the pushrods, and do help direct the air
&gt; rearward when traveling as well.  Leave em off if you want, but why?

well the pushrod protection is really the only part I worry about

&gt; I cannot count the number of buses I have seen people limp into my buddys
&gt; shop that people have removed engine tin from to &quot;help it cool better&quot; most
&gt; of them have at minimum a dropped halve, but generally require a rebuild.

I have guages and it has not seemed to effect the cooling...today 90+
degrees drove 70 miles on I-95 at 60+- MPH and temp held steady at about
215-220

seems ok to me.
  oil presure when I stopped behind my garage was a steady
30psi at idle, 5W-50 synthetic lube, 2,000 miles since last change
