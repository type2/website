Blizzard Bus-Out 2004!!
February 20-22
 
 
So who says I need a little kick in the ass every year to get this event off the ground?  (Todd Thompson, was that you?)  I need a BIG kick in the ass!
 
Never fear, fellow cats and babies, we're gonna do it again at OTTER LAKE...  frozen beer or no frozen beer!
 
Please pre-register yourselves and your traveling time-machines with the camp ground (info below), and please r.s.v.p. to me (Drew) at allwein_at_lmf_dot_net so I can keep a running tally of campers.
 
Huzzah! to the hardy souls who made the trip last year.  We were down in numbers from previous events, but snow storms will take their toll.
 
Winter camp is not for the timid, so sissies stay home!  But if you want to cavort by the fire and ski at the Blue, fall down in the snow and swill witches brew,
Then fire your engines, and tell all your friends
for the Bus-Out's upon us, and the fun shall not end!!!!!!!!!  ~Drew
 
Otter Lake Camp Resort: www.otterlake_dot_com  1-800-345-1369...  Tell them you're with the &quot;Volkswagen Group.&quot;
 
P.S.,   &quot;Ski at Shawnee&quot; didn't fit in my friggin' rhyme, even though Ski Shawnee is where we will most  likely recreate...  If Blue Mountain 
           is deemed preferrable by our throng, we shall consult our Pocono Area Map prior to Saturday morning's ski-depature time.
 
Friday night:  Wild goose over the fire for weary travelers, and hot witches brew will be on tap.
 
Saturday night: Pot luck.
 
Sunday: Frozen tears and breakfast amoung friends old and new prior to the return journey.
