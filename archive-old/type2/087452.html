&lt;&lt; Saw this ad and thought I would share it with you.  It is the front

end of a 78 Rabbit and the back end of a 72 Bus.  It looks like

someone did a nice job on it.  It's not mine and I do not know

anything about it.

Sorta like the dog walking on his hind legs; not that he does it well
or ill, but why does he do it at all...?-(
