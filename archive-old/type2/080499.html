Subject: Re: [T2] steering coupler folks be aware!!!!

Do you have a good source for this (website) or do you just go directly
through mercedes (mercedes_dot_com?).  Also, what's the cost and part number
because I think it'd be a good thing to replace regardless my coupler's
current condition.

thanks!
Mike

&gt; Just wanted to let y'all know that Mercedes uses the same coupler as VW on
&gt; several of its  1970-1990 models, but it is built much stouter than the
&gt; aftermarket VW couplers, and this should come as no surprise, about twice the
&gt; price. Just thought I'd pass it along.
