Subject: RE: steering r&amp;r

Hi Gary,

 

Mine was held in place by two bolts from the top. I was able to take the
bolts out, and then I can kind of wiggle to the cover plate, but unable to
move it up or down. I tried a pry bar, but didn't want to force it, for fear
of damaging the cover plate or seal. I think the seal is just super tight. I
didn't see two more bolts from underneath?

 

Eventually after about 1 hour of making my fingers as small as possible, I
was able to get the spade connector for the horn connected. I ended up using
two long skinny screwdrivers like chopsticks. Now the horn works. I still
would like to know about removing that cover plate though, as the
connections looks very dirty. I was unable to really clean them.

 

Thanks for your prompt response..

 

-Kevin

Hi Kevin, 

Boy, it's bee awhile, but I do remember there were a couple of bolts that
the only place to get to them was from underneath the Bus, from there, it
seems like the metal cover just kind of slid up the column. Do you have a
rubber seal between the column and the cover? Maybe that's making it super
tight. Sorry I just don't recall a lot more to it. I will go out and look at
it tonite afterwork and can get more to you tomorrow if you would like.

Gary
