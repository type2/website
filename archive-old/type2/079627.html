Subject: snow and ice....

Hey, since this will be my first winter in my bus, I'm wanting advice on how 
the bus (73 westy) will handle on snow and ice? I'm thinking about moving to 
the Lake Tahoe (or any ski resort) for the winter. Since I live in the bus, 
I'm going to have to drive it on more than a few occasaions. I'm just 
curious if there are any tips I might want heads up on. (weight over the 
front wheels,. changing idle or main jets for higher altitude from sea 
level??)
   Anyway, thanks for ideas!!

                  Ask for no security, ask for no guarantees,
                  there never was such an animal. And even if
                  there was it would be related to the great sloth
                  which hangs upside down all day, every day, wasting
                  its life away. To hell with that. Shake the
                  tree and knock the sloth down on his ass.
