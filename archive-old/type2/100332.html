Subject: Re: [T2] trying to get engine in my 71

Can you see your throttle cable?  Make sure it isn't caught betwixt the 
engine and tranny.  I've flubbed this one a few times I've done the 
overnighter on the engine R&amp;R myself.

	Eron

&gt;Does anyone have any suggestions for getting my engine back in my bus?
&gt;
&gt;Thanks,
&gt;Daniel
