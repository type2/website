Subject: RE: front knocking noise

&gt;I was riding along in my 71 Westy today and all of sudden a 
&gt;knocking noise comes from what sounds like the passenger sides 
&gt;front tire. The sound is irregular and I can hear more as soon 
&gt;as I took my foot off the gas pedal. 

Could be your non-retractable seatbelt hanging out the door and flapping in the 
wind.  Hey, don't laugh.  That one has scared the crap out of me more than once 
on a dark, lonely stretch of road...

On a more constructive note, definitely check your lug nuts!!  How do your 
brakes feel?  Sometimes old brake pads separate and the loose bit of pad could 
be banging around.
