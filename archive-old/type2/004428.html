 I own Irvine Hand Car Wash, Irvine, California.  The last time I saw you,
you were in Irvine for a VW show.  You were able to clean up your car prior
to the show at Irvine Hand Car Wash.  You and your club are certainly
welcome to the use of our facility at your next Irvine show.  If you recall,
our wash tunnel is &quot;by
 hand only&quot;, and the conveyor is set such that it can handle lowered and
show equipped vehicles.  If I can be of service to you, please contact me
either via e-mail or by telephone at (949) 654-4133.
 Thanks  Joel Burnstine&quot; &lt;jmbcoinc_at_jmbcoinc_dot_com&gt;
