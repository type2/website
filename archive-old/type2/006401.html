X-Diagnostic: MESSAGE MAY NOT BE TOPICAL

I just returned from a trouble-free trip from St. Louis, MO to New
Orleans and back in my '77 Westy.  I want to first thank all the folks
on the AIRS list and elsewhere who, implictly or explicitly, offered
their assistance in case of trouble.  It sure was comforting to have
those names and numbers.  The trip also gave me the opportunity to
road-test my Colman Blackcat catylic heater.

The whole trip was just shy of 1400 miles. We drove 8 hours to
Jackson, MS last Tuesday before the hunger and cold got the better of
us.  Being born and raised in the Northeast, the thought of Jackson,
Mississippi brought to mind the song Uneasy Rider by Charlie Daniel's
band (the story of the song takes place there- if you know the song
and consider I was driving a bright yellow VW you'll understand).

We were cold because I hadn't yet figured out the best way to use the
heater.  We initially put it on full blast, requiring us to open the
vent and crack the windows to get rid of the fumes, keeping us just as
cold (if not colder) as we would have been if we didn't have the
heater on. It also made us go through a tank of propane in ~2.5 hours,
so we ran out (thank you Target of Jackson, MS).  We learned the next
day that if you just put it on low, you don't need any additional
venting (I have a drafty bus) and there is a net gain of enough heat
to keep most of our body from freezing (note that I have non-stock
exhaust so no heat from the motor, it was ~40 degrees or so, and were
were also wearing coats, hats &amp; gloves).  With this method a tank
lasted ~7 hours.  Definately worth the ~$40-50.  Not sure I'd be so
keen on having it running while I was not moving though.

We did the return trip in one shot of about 12 hours, stopping every
~3 hours for gas.  Averaged an expected 15 mpg while maintaining an
indicated 70 MPH (closer to 65) with the PO installed weber/009 combo.
Oil pressure stayed at a steady 55 psi on the highway, and 15 psi at
idle.  This trip also marked the 10,000 mile of me in the bus over the
past 16 months, bringing her odo up to just over 102K  (as an aside,
the local VW dealer has a 2001 EV camper that doesn't get any better
MPG and costs $42K, but talk about posh inside)

Driving past Memphis was quite nice with all the bridges spanning the
Mississippi and some cool looking pyramid building.  The Missiouri and
Arkansas farmlands turned into Mississippi forest and Louisiana
wetlands- all very pretty.  It was amazing to see in New Orleans that
the Mississippi river is actually higher than the roads in the French
Quarter.  Poor weather and work responsibilities prevented me from
seeing all of New Orleans, but certainly a great town to visit.

Bus sightings: 1 blue early bay north of Memphis and a funky
multi-pastel colored split parked near Bourbon St. in New Orleans.

Happy motoring y'all
