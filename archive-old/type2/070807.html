Subject: vacuum hoses

--part1_a5.1aae325a.28bf978e_boundary

Ever since a disgruntled owner gave me a '73 bus a month ago, I've been 
reading the digest with great pleasure and enjoying the parade of expertise 
displayed.
I'm replacing all mechanical components as money allows and &quot;Tulip&quot; has been 
on the road for two weeks now.
Yesterday I installed all-new vacuum hoses and found Home Depot has a 
reinforced PVC hose that appears to work well. I used two sizes: the 1/2&quot; ID 
for the main line running to the brake booster and 1/4&quot; ID off a tee and 
going to the automatic transmission. I used a regular 5/8&quot; thick-wall hose on 
the booster vent connection.  I spent about $8 for all hoses.
Hope this helps someone who might not want to spend the money at this point 
for the OEM hoses.
