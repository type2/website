Subject: Parts Failure Survey Results

Volks:

Here is the results of the Parts Failure Survey that I did last Friday. 
The most frequent failure items are listed first and then the rest are
listed in no particular order.

Fuel line rubber hose           3 occurrences
Fuel tank fill line hose        3 occurrences
Starter wiring (hot start pbm)  3 occurrences
Front axle beam rust            2 occurrences
Direction switch                2 occurrences
Air flow meter                  2 occurrences
Rust under windshield           2 occurrences

The following occured only once in the survey.

Mirror support bracket failure
Sliding door latch failure
Bad Fuel Injection grounds
Clutch cable breakage
Worn or fouled injectors
Deteriorated air flow hoses
Fuel pump
Push rod tube seals
Water in relays - caused by leakage/rust around windshield seal
Water in fuses
Sunvisor clips
Loose-worn top roller on sliding door
Four-way flasher switch
Loose lock cylinder in doors
Poor grounds in fuel injection circuits
Dropped valve seat
Mice nests
Swing lever arm housing rust
Westy bed hardware aligment
Westy louvered windows mechinism loosness
Fresh air vent fails to close (broken plastic linkage arm)
Plastic gear failure in wiper motor
Alternator
Vacuun booster 
Vacuum lines rotted
Westy pop top seal
Westy water pump

Body rust areas:
Front window seal area
Fresh air vent
Sliding door track
Front and rear wheel arches
Front steps
Sliding door rail covers
Under lugage rack seal
Battery tray rust


Normal maintence items mentioned:

Wheel bearings
Shocks
Brakes - pads, shoes, rotors and drums
CV joints and boots
Spark plugs and cap
Ignition wires
Air filter
Oil filter (T4 engine only!)
Gas filter
Tires
Corroded fuses
Lamps


I hope that this of some use to you.  As for me, it gives me a place to
start a pre-trip check list, to insure that the many things that can go
wrong don't go wrong.  Although may of the items can be inspested and
replaced prior to the trip, unfortunatly ther is no way to determine if
something like an alternator of a fuel pump will prior to a long trip
(15k miles or so).  A failure rate survey like this is helpful in
identifying parts that shouldbe taked along &quot;just incase&quot;.

Thanks for your help.
