I had that same problem in my '72, 1700cc.  Not sure why it did it, but it
always had oil, and yes it was mostly a right turn??  I never did figure it
out.  Since then though, that oil pump in that engine has gone up, and I've
just replaced the engine until I can get that other one fixed.

&gt; Hey y'all
&gt; I thing I've got a bad sending unit.  When the bus is still not fully
warmed
&gt; up and I take a fairl sharp right hand bend in a 'spirited manner', my oil
&gt; pressure gauge and light come on.  Of course I shut down immediately and
go
&gt; out back to check.  Plenty of oil in the sump, sending unit wires are
there.
&gt;   I'm running a dual output sending unit (light and gauge).  Any thoughts?
