Subject: Add-on taillight assemblies?

From: &quot;George Lyle&quot; &lt;glyle_at_pon.type2_dot_com&gt;
&gt; ... One place that our buses are definitely behind the times is in the
area of taillights...

Oh.  I am going to hate myself in the morning...

I don't know what to do with older buses, especially as I have a `77.

But.  What if there was a housing that would attach to the rear-facing side
of the engine compartment intakes on either side of at bus like my `77 bay;
a housing that would allow the installation of some factory or generic
modern taillight fixture (brake and stop light) that would be tied into the
existing circuits through relays.

The relays would use the existing light current to shunt power directly to
the new fixtures from the battery (short of like the H4 headlights).  The
size of the new fixtures would not be an issue, though the lights from a 767
might be a tad overkill...

The fixtures would attach by hooking over the openings of the vents and then
somehow being strapped/latched/fastened by leading some sort of strap around
the edge of the rear hatch opening.  The wires would be dropped through the
cooling ducts (name?), to quick disconnects wired to the relays.  This would
allow the bus to retain it's original factory look at shows, etc..

The resulting rear-facing light show might give the H4 headlights a run for
their money...

Now, would the lower engine intake vent position on older buses be adequate
for this purpose?  I don't know enough about what's available to use as an
anchor point on an older bus, but I'll have a good idea what's what at next
month's local club meeting.
