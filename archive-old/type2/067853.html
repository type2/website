Subject: Re: New Post Examines Evil Nazi Blood Guilt on all VW Owner's Hands 

&gt;Oh, puleeeeeeeeeeeese!
&gt;By keeping some nearly ancient van-type vehicles on the road, 
&gt;we're all guilty of having Evil Nazi Blood Guilt on our hands??  
&gt;Simply ludicrous!
&gt;
&gt;But that's not all.  My ancestry is 1/4 German, so I am additionally 
&gt;responsible for the sinking of the Lusitania!  My Norwegian
&gt;ancestry fills me with guilt for the crimes of the Vikings.  Oh, will
&gt;my Blood Guilt never end?  

 &quot;The Lord loves a sinner&quot;, and let's go shoot some Indians
