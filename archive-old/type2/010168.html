&gt; EJ and list,
&gt; 
&gt; Just wanted to reiterate that i made my post _after_ i read the following
post
&gt; by Mike G., so what i posted ain't really the way things is goin.
&gt; 
&gt; BTW my brain thanx you for the compliment EJ  ;-]

&gt; Original Gensler Post &quot;Great Bus Rally Step #1&quot;:
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;Wow! Lots of interest in this. 
&gt; 
&gt; Charlie Ford agrees that compiling the names of potential participation for

&gt; this would be a good first step. And I volunteered to be the repository. 
&gt; The number of responses I get will probably determine some of how this thing

&gt; gets planned out. And of course the route will be based on where we have 
&gt; willing drivers. 
&gt; 
&gt; I'm starting to think that rather than a 2-directional competition type 
&gt; thing that maybe we should have a single 'round-the-country' (continent?) 
&gt; thing. Picture a route zig-zagging all over the country(s), covering as 
&gt; many places as we've got buses! Pass a camera(s) and log book everytime you

&gt; trade off with each driver logging any comments, scenery, restaurants, 
&gt; roadkill, whatever-tickles-you-fancy in it. Parts of the journey might 
&gt; even be made up of mini caravans and possibly some group-campouts depending

&gt; on the number of participants for the various legs. Then post the whole 
&gt; shabang on a web page complete with pictures, log book entries, 
&gt; drivers/passengers/buses that made each leg, etc. What do you all think of 
&gt; this? 
&gt; 
&gt; In the mean time, if you're interested in participating, here's what I need

&gt; from you (mail to ME at mike_gensler_at_udscorp_dot_com, not to the list): 
&gt; 
&gt; Name: 
&gt; Bus type: 
&gt; City: 
&gt; State: 
&gt; Maximum # of ONE-WAY miles you'd be willing to drive (remember, how ever far

&gt; you drive, you've got to drive to get back home again): 
&gt; 
&gt; At this point, this is not a commitment (I know time frames will affect some

&gt; folks). This is just to see if we've got enough interest to make something 
&gt; work. After we see how much participation we've got, we'll look at how to 
&gt; organize it, plan the route, set a starting time, and start signing people 
&gt; up for the various legs and figure out time frames (I expect that to be the

&gt; biggest problem). 
&gt; 
&gt; Also, please don't feel that I've &quot;taken over&quot; this idea and am railroading

&gt; it - this is a democratic thing and any and all ideas and suggestions as to

&gt; how this thing should work are welcome. Lets just try to put together 
&gt; something that will be fun for all, give some of us a chance to meet other 
&gt; listees, and most important, get out on the road with our great vehicles.

there's
