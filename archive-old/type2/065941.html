Subject: Re:46 Bug..where is the oldest bus?

Willi Lotterman in Germany has a real old bug ..it was shining in the sun at
Bad Canberg this year..I think it was 45 or 46...maybe someone out there ahs a
better memory than me...I was still recovering from the sight of all those
Barndoors on pristine parade (including Herr Lotterman again)
BTW...who owns the lodest bus around? Any ideas? Oldest one in UK is Jan 1952
chassis 20 020 791 Panel Van owned by Charlie Highgate with Ritchie King coming
in with April 52 Panel van.
So...where in the world is the oldest surviving still functioning privately
owned Bus..anyone wanna nominate something for starters?
Alternatively..where is the oldest bus even if its a wreck!!
