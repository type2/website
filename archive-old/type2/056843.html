hi volks, im slowly getting there putting my bits and pieces back together.
however silly (ok stupid) me tipped the motor upside down with the distributor
out and bonk, the drive fell out. now question: how hard is this gonna be
putting it back. i know about the spacer (shim whatever) and grease and slide
it down a screwdriver first but how will i know at which position to drop it
in. i was thinking that it doesnt matter because all i have to do is move the
distributor around until i get it in the right place to run, even if that is
180 degrees from where it used to be. the distributor can be rotated to
wherever it needs to be to set #1 wire with tdc on #1 piston. yes/no?

in theory theres no difference between theory and practice, in practice there
is - whoever made that up is so right........

thanks people,  marty :)
