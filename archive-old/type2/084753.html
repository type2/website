Subject: Partnumber help

Hi all, 

I just moved and don't have all my stuff with me yet. 

I need the partnumber for a '74 Bus with headlight washers. 

This switch is listed along with the other parts that make 
up the headlight washer system in a seperate drawing on the 
fiche. It would have to be a somewhat older fiche as the later 
ones simply list it NLA. I think it was something like 
211 955 501 D, but I'm not sure. (211 955 501 B is the regular 
one) Any help on this one would be greatly appreciated. 

Thanks, 

Brian
