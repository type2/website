Ken,

Don't scare everybody off! :-) Steve is also extremely knowledgable
about all sorts of VWs, he's very well-read (so can talk to just about
anyone about just about anything), he's got a good sense of humor, and
he's also kind, generous, and just generally fun to be around.

Nikki

&gt; He seems to especially enjoy
&gt; discussing religion and politics but somehow he's able to do it without
&gt; offending people
