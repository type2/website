Subject: [T2] what carbs Webers, or Kadrons

 Hello all,
   I have a delema, I am building an 1800cc type 4 for a
71 Bus. It will have the Joe Cali upright conversion. I
have two sets of carbs right now.
 One set is Weber 34ICT's and the other is 40mm Kadrons.
I found I can get type 4 manifolds for the Kadrons for $100
and have the type 4 manifolds
 for the ICTs. 
   So what carbs would be best for this engine. The engine
is a completely stock 1800 except for the external upright
&gt; conversion(stock compression and cam, heat exchangers and
all). Is one a better carb than the other, I know the
Webers have a much better linkage, but may sit way too low
for this conversion. The Kadrons are bigger and may make
more HP, but are these better for the type 1 than the type
4? 
  Please do not suggest that I junk them both, I do not
have that kind of money. I want IDAs, but I HAVE Webers and
Kadrons. Shoe string is the best discription of my budget.
