A coupla months ago DocRic purchased a junked 69 westy to use as a parts
source for the resto of Urge, his beloved '71 Westy. One thing he did not
need was another camper interior so he kindly let me know it was mine if I
wanted it. 

Last Sunday I cleaned all the junk out of our 72 except for the middle seat,
loaded up the family and headed west, up and over the Blue Ridge and into
Tenn. The 150 mile ride was uneventful except for the beautiful view. 150
miles later we were in Roan Mt, Tn. As is customary we went to The Clinic to
see if the good Doctor was in but all was quiet there so we headed up into
the hills in search of our host. Driving thru the hills I finally recognized
the old tractor that is parked at the end of the road that leads up to Rics.


We passed the 69 sitting halfway up the road to the house. It looked
peaceful as it rested under the blue tarp. A little farther up the road we
reached the house and were greeted by barking dogs and smiling kids. 

Ric and Pam are the nicest of people and have 4 wonderful girls between 6
and 12. They welcomed us into their home and made a wonderful meal. After
lunch and a flukey rain storm I was ready for a nap but there was work to be
done. All the kids went out back and played on the trampoline, Pam and
Michele walked around the farm while Ric and me went after that interior. 

*ALERT: BUS CONTENT*

I backed the 72 down the long drive and into the field where the 69 was
stashed. The 72 immediately got stuck in the mud and slid a bit down the
hill. We figured we would mess with it later. We pulled our tools and
started figuring out where to start. Ric has done this gig before so he was
in charge. I just handed him the right size sockets! The interior is in
remarkable shape for a bus that was junked. The makeshift sink was the first
to go and is prolly sitting where we left it. Next came the jumpseat and the
table. Pretty easy so  far. The bed took a bit more fussing but Ric was able
to coax out all the fasteners. Finally the closet came out with little
resistance. After all of it was out a quick inspection revealed no major
problems except a bit of rot in the side of the jumpseat and a lot of lady
bugs in the closet. 

Now the trick was to load all this in the 72 plus the middle bench so stella
would have a safe place to sit on the way home.  The 72 is one of those
&quot;dime a dozen &quot; passenger buses that we have here in the South. Being such
it has rear heat vents under the back bench. This would not allow normal
installation of the Westy seat bed. Ric and I carefully removed the bottom
panel of the Westy seat so it would fit over the heat vents. This was a
sorta touchy job cause that bottom panel was not really meant to be removed.
I unbolted all the fasteners and Ric gently pried apart the staples.  It
fits perfectly in the 72. The closet was another challenge because the
filler neck on the 72 is a bit farther back then on the 69. We were able to
get it in but not secured.

A word about installation: it is the reverse of removal. In my overwhelming
joy I forgot the first law of Buses and tried to put it in the same way it
came out. We pulled it all back out and did it the right way. We were able
to get the entire westy interior and the middle bench in with no room to
spare. 

We went to wash up and we were greeted by all the kids screaming for us to
come jump on the trampoline. Being less than graceful I tried to get out of
it but no deal. Next it was a visit to the chicken barn for some free range
fresh eggs. It was getting late and we knew we had a long drive ahead of us.
So after many goodbyes we made our way home thru the darkness.

I will post on the actual conversion from passenger bus to camper as it
happens over the next few weeks. I hope to unveil it at the
Type2_dot_campout:EveryBus in April.

Parts still needed:childs hammock and a decent pair of Jalousie windows
