&gt; I purchased my new arms from a mechanic here on the list &quot;orangevw&quot;  aka Bob  (orangevw_at_email.msn_dot_com).  Listen guys .... he is the best person to do business with, reasonable and honest.  If I didn't live on the other side os the US, he would be the only person that I would take my bus to.  Customer service is #1, and that is VERY hard to find.  So again thanks to everyone who lended a hand in this and Kudos to &quot;Bob&quot; making this experience even more enjoyable!  

I will second that bob is great. He sent me a steering box and I sent him
the cash after I got it. And offered some 'beyond the usual' help when it
looked like ups might have lost it.
