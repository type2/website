well here it is 9pm i let the valet take my bus to park and whalla ahh 5 
minutes later sir we have a problem all at once i only have 3rd &amp;4th my 
69-westy has never had a trans problem it is very very stiff just to move the 
shifter between 3rd &amp;4th as far as any other gears no way no 1st 2nd or 
reverse. could this be a sheared shift llink or an interanal trans problem 
any help would be great (ps.they took very good care of us) any ideas would 
be great before i go back over to look at it tommarrow .
