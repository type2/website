Subject: Trip to Turkey

Hi all,

I promised to update on our trip to Turkey, so here it is...

Spring last year I reported to take our Bay-window '69 &quot;buske&quot; for a long
trip to Turkey... Well, we are allmost on our way back to Belgium. We had a
wonderful time but unfortunately we had to leave the van in Hongary after
driving it for about 2500 kilometers. Why? Because first we had a lot of
troubles with the starter. Though it was a new one, the coil gave up and I
had to replace it. We were in Poland at that time and it was easy to find
another coil - people have been very friendly and helpful over there. Then
the whealdrum was completely worn out - a noise I thought was the gearbox
had always been there and one moment the axis in the wheal would not turn
the wheal anymore! Fornunately we met Marek, a Polish owner of three
bay-windows and founder of a VW-club in Poland. We spent the whole weekend
in his house waiting for the new part to arrive and we had a wonderful time
again. Thank you Marek and thank you all, VW-enthousiasts.
In Hungary a gummie in the master brake cilinder broke because of a huge
irregularity in the intern of this brake cilinder. Again this was a brand
new part - even still under warrant I guess, I look for it when we return
home. Murphy's law, I guess. We could only change the seal but we were
afraid it would brake again considering the long distance we still wanted to
travel - so we decided to travel further on by public transport.

Anyway, we had a wonderful time and now we return home - planning to arrive
in Belgium in about a month - with a lot of story's, addresses from many
very kind people we met and fortunately we can still drive the bus...

Belgian greets...

Bart
