sounds like time for a tranny oil change...
I had the same problem, but it mostly did it into second gear (it was
like trying to shift into a wall), and it only did it when I pulled out
in front of someone...

get redline, the synchros like it... First I tried sta lube, which was a
disaster, then I tried valvoline, which worked ok when warm but the
gears still ground in the morning, then I put in redline and my tranny
is happy...
