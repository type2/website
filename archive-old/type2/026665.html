	As it turned out I had a couple of BAD fuses, but 
	not BLOWN fuses.  The metal strips in the fuses were so old and
brittle 
	they would sometimes carry current and sometimes they woudn't.  They

	looked fine, but when I removed them the metal strips would crumble
at a 
	touch.  

	I've run into this problem with most of my older vehicles.  I
periodically take out all fuses, inspect, clean (600 grit sand paper
followed by light oil or silicone) and replace.  I also clean/oil the
holders.  When I have to replace them, I like the new glass fuses that have
pointed ends, but I can't always find em.  I can't remember how many of my
friends older cars I have &quot;magically repaired&quot; by just removing, cleaning,
and replacing the fuses.
