Subject: space for a BN4 in a 1979 2L camper

Dear All!
I have found an old BN4 at a brakers jard with everything apart from 
heater and fuel pump missing.
I have now spend several weeks getting bits and improvising. Got the 
thermostat, benchtested the heater, made up the caps at the end of 
the heater to connect to flexible 8cm ducting etc.
This evening I had a look at my mates 1979 2L twin carb T2 to check 
how it was going to fit in, AND I THINK IT DOES NOT FIT !???
I just don't seem to have enough space to get it in there. I am 
either sitting up against the spare wheel or the carb.
Has the engine bay changes a lot from early seventies to the later ones?
I hope I am mistaken here and would welcome any comments.
Alternatively how do you feel about me putting the heater inline into 
the main heating duct under the van instead?

Thanks,

Lukas
