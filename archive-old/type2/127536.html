&gt; Is this 'sensor' mounted at the inner edge of the

&gt; 
&gt; If yes, maybe someone lost the one 10mm screw that
&gt; holds the tin down?  All the other tin screws are 6
&gt; x 1.0
&gt; except 2 under the heads and the one 10mm screw.....
&gt; Maybe they put a phoney sensor in as a screw.
  
  Karl, 
 
  I think thats it, I just want to verify the part #.
