Subject: Re: [T2] Transmission Support. 

I forgot to mention this, the mechanic who told me to use additional
support told me that letting the tranny hang makes the driveshafts
function as a tripod hence aolt of compression forces placed on cv's etc
and the thrid part of the tripod being the mount on the front of the
tranny, it makes sense to me ... the three manuals i have all say to
support the tranny.
good luck
