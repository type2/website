Subject: started my first dizzy rebuild.......
Message-ID: &lt;a098c115.247ca557_at_aol_dot_com&gt;

Well if anyone has been following, I have been searching for an original 
dizzy for my 73 bus.  Finally I found one today that seems to bee about exact 
to OEM euipment.  so i decided to pull it apart and shim it nice and snug.

everything came apart quite nicely and seems like it should be pretty 
self-explanatory as to putting it back together.  

a couple Q's.........

how much do you shim it??

where do you shim it??
     At the bottom where the offset dog is??
     Or inside the dizzy body where I found a little fiber type gasket??
     What is the max amount of shims to use??
     Is there a number I should be shooting for ( i.e. .005 in)???

do I lube all parts as they go back together??
    grease??
    oil??

And are there any weird things to be wary of when reassembling it later??

And FINALLY, I have searched the archives and the library thru-out this whole 
dizzy problem and have not found much info on the subject of actually how-to 
articles on the rebuild itself??  Anyone have a site on this???

Thanks...Zac.
