Subject: vac dizzy help on 71 1600 dp...

Listees,

I'm in a bind trying to get this vac dizzy to work. It's a 205AH which is 
supposed to be completely interchanable with the stock 205Q for this engine. 
German. My bus was running a 009 and I had gotten it to run pretty well with 
it.

So the problem is serious lack of power, like it's running on 2 or 3 
cylinders. I have verified the wires are correct and also verified all the 
boys are firing. Here's a pic of my set up at one stage of messing with it:

Since then I have figured out the port in the rear on dizzy is vac and 
outside is retard. You can only blow in on the inner port. The vac hooked up 
to the drivers side of the carb and the dizzy doesn't advance AT ALL when 
you rev her. But hooked up to the other one it does.

So is the vacuum unit shot? Maybe I'm running the wrong points, they are 
what I got for my 009 but thought they would be interchanable. Would 
condensor have anything to do with problems?? I have points gapped at Muirs 
spec and I&quot;m timing it at 5ATDC at 800RPM.

Any suggestions on getting this setup tuned will be helpful, otherwise I'm 
giving up and putting the evil 009 back in so I can drive and pick up my 
paycheck later today.

TIA.
