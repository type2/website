Since buying my 71 westy a year ago I often hear a clunking sound somewhere 
back there when going over bumps (lots of bumps here in New Orleans). Since 
that time, the engine (due to other reasons) has been replaced twice, so I 
assume the mounts are ok, hope so anyway. Any ideas what to check for, in 
order of possibility? Other than the heat exchangers slightly loose (making 
I think the higher pitched rattling I hear) - what could it be? I've tried 
moving things up and down manually but haved found anything else. Could it 
be just shocks? I know the battery floats a little - any good ways to hold 
it in place? (New battery tray installed in winter.)
I'm also getting water in the battery tray during heavy rains (as common as 
bumps here)- maybe leak from side marker lens? is it worth drilling a drain 
hole back there?
thanks
Wink
71 Westy (Julie)
