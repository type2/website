Subject: Bus Nicknames

I call my bus &quot;Buster&quot;, for 3 reasons:

One: The name has always appealed to me.  I used to chat with a guy (who I 
never met) who owned a towing company, many years ago when I worked as a 
switchboard operator and dispatcher for an answering service.  His name was 
Buster.  He had the perfect voice for someone I would associate with that 
name, and somehow, the name grew on me with time.

Two:  Buster's name is also a part of what he is.  A Bus.

Three:  His name is also a part of what Buster loves to do, Bust my Beans!  
Wait till the last possible moment, and then suddenly lurch to a halt when I 
have somewhere important to go.  Or the coil goes bad.  Or the Generator 
light comes on half way around the country with no gas station in sight for 
the next 4 hours.  Or I freeze my butt off in winter.  It's a love hate 
relationship, and somehow, even though I've thought about selling Buster many 
times, I always go back to loving this vehicle and wondering how I could have 
ever thought of selling him.  So I love him, and then he busts my beans, and 
then I hate him and somehow, with time, learn to love him all over again.  
Strange relationship, isn't it? (Sounds familiar, doesn't it?)  - So 
appropriately the name, dubbed &quot;Buster&quot;, the bus.
