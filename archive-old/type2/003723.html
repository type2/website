&gt;My windshield was done the exact same way.  The passenger side upper corner
&gt;is not fully seated.  The problem is most likely the shape of the glass and
&gt;not the seal.  I'ts a tight fit, so they should have pulled it out and
tried
&gt;it again.
&gt;
&gt;The problem is that they don't tell you about it until they already smeared
&gt;the glue all over it.
&gt;
&gt;You better have them bring new glass also.  See if they can order a
different
&gt;brand and compare the 2.


There is no problem with the Safelite glass, only with installation and with
the seals, as I've said many times the bay windshield is a tough install any
way round.  All the VW glass I've reinstalled with aftermarket seals has
exhibited the same problem seating the upper corners.  You install 10, you
get about 5 right, 3 OK, 2 broken.  The top corners are always the SOB, you
need to pull the top FIRST, if the guy doesn't start doing that, tell him
it's his ass if it doesn't come out right.  Aftermarket seals are a major
problem as well, none of them, read that even WCM are going to fit correctly
like VW intended (Anyone tried WW's new trim groove seal?) because none of
them have bent corners.  The fit will be OK to poor depending on how lucky
one is.  The Safelite guy who installed mine installed it without sealent,
only with a little spray silicone to seat, then wanted to seal it up, but as
I said then I opted instead to put a heater in the bus for 4-5 hours so the
seal would be cozy warm then beat scrunched wiggled the glass and seal to
get it perfect, and it was good to begin with.  Then I let it sit a day,
then I sealed it myself.  This is what you got to do, and needless to say of
course the frame needed to be in good shape first off.  My Safelite guy was
quite helpfull he was even going to come back the next day and seal it for
me after it had set.  I had no leaks for the couple of months I still owned
the truck, the new owner would know if it is holding OK.  And my seal was a
very poor fit to boot.  However the treatment Chris has recieved is
terrible, Safelite owes him a new seal and properly installed glass.
Sending a guy out with another can of silicone is the sign of a low class
shop employing high school drop outs managed by a shifty lowlife scum, the
kind of person who also probably manages a quick lube shop that strips drain
plugs and puts a rubber expandy plug in without telling you.

My opinions.
