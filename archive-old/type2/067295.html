Subject: Rescue this van.

 I saw this in todays paper 10/31.

&quot;In an effort to draw contrasts between Democratic Sen. Paul Wellstone and 
Republican challenger Rudy Bochwitz, the Republican Party began a tour Wednesday
of parts of Minnesota, hauling a dilapidated 1967 Volkswagen van around with a 
tow truck.
  The van, Party Chairman Chris Georgacas said, represents the &quot;failed ideology 
of Paul Wellstone' and like Wellstone, 'is on its last axle.'  He said the van 
will be towed through southern and northwestern Minnesota, the heart of 
Republican strength in the state, for three days.&quot;

O.K. folks now I am pissed.  The van is a nice old splittie that looked in 
pretty good shape and was running just a few months ago when they were going to 
drive it around the state.    Failed? The thing ran for nearly 30 years before 
the Rebulicans got ahold of it and blew it up. Now they are going to parade the 
body around the state like some sort of gruesome war treasure.  I hope my buddy 
Paul kicks ass on these guys Tuesday. I also hope that someone can get ahold of 
the poor van victim and give it life again.  Maybe they will be so depressed 
after Tuesday they will just give it away to someone (me?), because it holds so 
many bad memories.  Hmmmmm.  Chris. Oh, Chris!
