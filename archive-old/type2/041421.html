Subject: Suggestions on removing cylinders?

The basic procedure for doing this is pretty simple: remove heads, grab
cylinder and pull really, really hard. Welcome to the land beyond basic.

The engine I'm dealing with (a Type 4 1.7l) has been outside in the rain and
hurricanes for five years, alone and unloved. And it was parked in the first
place because the engine seized. Translation: the jugs are on there but
good.

The ideas I had were, in ascending order of insanity:
Use naval jelly to attempt to dissolve the rust sealing the rings to the
cylinder walls
Use Diet Pepsi to attempt to do the same thing. This is an old Indian trick
for unseizing watercooled engines; it may work here.
Take out all the studs, put the engine on one cylinder bank (the other
sticking straight up) and lightly tap the pistons with my friend Erich, the
16-lb sledge hammer (which I bought during the first couple of days after
the Berlin Wall opened--I lived in Berlin at the time--and named after the
guy who was Chief of East German Construction Troops in August 1961 and who,
therefore, was responsible for building the Berlin Wall) until the rust
breaks free
Use a Tiger saw (kinda like a Sawzall, but not made by Milwaukee) with a
metalcutting blade in it to cut through the jugs, followed by judicious use
of a crowbar to pop off the chunks

Anyone got any better ideas? Because those all seem just this side of nuts
to me.
