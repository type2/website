Subject: Re: [T2] Wanted: Bus Towbar

Hi Jim

I was wondering where this rule of thumb comes from,, what difference does it
make to the trans or axles if they are turning while being towed??

Naturally you have to put the trans in neutral, and I know that the auto trans
in a North american car doesn't like the lack of lubrication while being
towed.... 

I was under the impression that the final drive in a BuS or BuG automatic trans
is the same as the manual and it could be towed safely as well...

Anyways,, I have towed both Auto and manual ACVW trans for hundreds of miles at
a time using a tow bar,, and never had a single trans/axle issue,,

&gt; &gt; its my guess that the rule of not towing a Bus with the drive shafts connected
&gt; &gt; would hold true for a bug b/c we have the same principles working in the
&gt; &gt; tranys. However, I am speaking without experience so I posted this to the list
&gt; &gt; in hope a a more informed opinion than my own.
&gt; 
&gt; Quick rule of thumb: if it has constant velocity joints on the wheels that
&gt; are on the ground when you're towing it, remove the axles (none of this
&gt; unhook the wheel end and tie it up crap either; unhooking both ends takes
&gt; very little extra time, and you'll be sure the balls aren't going to fall
&gt; out ten miles from your destination), put them in garbage bags and stick 'em
&gt; somewhere safe. This goes for Buses, Bugs, Hyundai Elantras, Oldsmobile
&gt; Cutlasses, anything.
