FS: Bay Axle Beam.

... or, the whole '71 bus of which it is a part.

... or, the axle beam is free with installation.

This axle beam is currently on a '71, but it can fit a late bay too, as
long as you swap the steering knuckles from a late bay -- somebody
correct me if I'm wront.  Actually, it currently has a late knuckle on
one side, several years ago as a temporary fix (not by me, and it wasn't
my bus then).
The bus has a broken windshield, lots of bondo, body rust, and melted
down ignition wires; but I don't want the axle beam to go to the
junkyard or into my basement, as it is solid.  I've an axle beam swap
before, and will do it again, if somebody wants to fund my efforts.
