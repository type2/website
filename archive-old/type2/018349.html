Subject: A child's cot?  A child's hammock?
Message-ID: &lt;375887FD.7041_at_worldnet.att_dot_net&gt;

Okay, since I just missed out on getting one of the above, can someone
describe a child's cot and/or hammock.  I am wondering about the one
that goes over (I assume) the front seats. 

Is is a cot--that is with stiff supports along the sides, or is it what
I think of as a hammock, a soft fabric sling to sleep or rest in?  

How do they mount?  What is the max weight they will hold?

Come on, tell me all about them . . . So maybe I won't miss the next
one. . .I think one would be great to take with us camping to Alaska! 
(maybe.)

Thanks all!
