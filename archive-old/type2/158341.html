&gt; I had a 1960 23 window deluxe some years ago. always worried how I would
&gt; replace those windows if they ever got broken....fortunately never did.
&gt; wish I still had that old beast.  sold it about 1972 or so for $125

   Quite a few years ago, an older (80+) friend of mine gave me a '69
Ghia...Pretty beat, lots of rust, etc... Neighbor down the street from
me saw in in my backyard and went nuts over it...I told him it was his,
but no returns... ;-(
   We hooked a chain to it and lugged it to his backyard.
   The next day his wife saw me and said that although she was not all
that happy to see it in &quot;her&quot; backyard she was happy that her husband
had finally found his dream car...He'd wanted one ever since he saw
Eddie Murphy drive one in &quot;48 Hours&quot;
   I didn't say a word... ;-)
