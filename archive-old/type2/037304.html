Subject: Multimeter bonanza!

So I got a few responses to my multimeter advice request a couple of weeks
ago and went searching on the net to see if I could find some deals.  The
consensus seemd to be for Sunpro stuff as that was inexpensive and fit the
task.

Well, I couldn't have asked for more.  www.actron_dot_com, the people that make
Sunpro have a garage sale area and I picked up a digital tach/dwell/volt/ohm
meter for $15 and an analog inductive engine analyzer for $24.  I received
them today and they work well, so I thought I would pass the info on to
everyone in the list.  There are some other things there too, like a hand
held vacuum pump, and for anyone that has $350 a digital scope that looks
useful.

Happy buying,
Niall
