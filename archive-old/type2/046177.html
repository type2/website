Why all this fuss over the last few days as to where to leave the extra keys??!! Most Volkswagens, you need the key to lock it up with (1980 and up Vanagons.)  I seriously doubt that any car thief would even consider stealing a VW van. The car thieves are usually on the look out for the late model popular vehicles, so they can part them out. The only busses in danger are the pre-1967. Those have a record of being stolen!! These newer busses, like the ones refered to on this list, are not in danger of being stolen, but broken into, to be able to steal the stereo, and what have you. Yes, we are all a little overprotective of our dear VW busses (count me in), but that is more because of the LOVE than of anything else.

Excuse me for saying so, but that seems like a dangerously obvious place for 
a spare-key stash (IMHO).  I say this out of concern, not scorn.

Then again, I'm a &quot;distributor, don't go on long backpacking trips w/out it 
(in a ziploc bag)&quot; kind of guy (when weight permits - I'm sure there's any 
easier way, but I'm slow in that regard) who carries an extra set of keys 
secreted away somewhere on his person/gear (and sometimes will give an 
additional set to travelling companion).

Ciao,

I keep a spare set of keys inside the hatch where the oil goes and the
license plate is.
