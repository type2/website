&gt;   The one thing I am going to need for it though is the trim around the
&gt; cabinet doors. It is the white trim that goes on the edge of the doors and
&gt; fits against the cabinet. I read in the library of &quot;T&quot; moldings. Is this the
&gt; stuff? It seems to me it would be more &quot;+&quot; shaped. I have the Outwater
&gt; catalog, but do not know what the part number would be. 

Outwater will send samples, ask for some samples of what you think is
close or if you have a small piece send it to them, they probably have one
of the largest selections of plastics &quot;shaped&quot;, thier problem is that they
have such huge min quantities and their prices are not exceptionally low.
