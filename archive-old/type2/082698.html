Subject: Re: [T2] online parts shops

Highly recommended online parts shops, in no particular order:
http://www.aircooled_dot_net/
http://www.bus-boys_dot_com/
http://www.bustedbus_dot_com/
http://www.type2parts_dot_com/
http://www.busdepot_dot_com/

All of these regularly post on this list, have used a few myself, been
pleased with results, value vs. cost.  But, opinions vary!  I hope this
thread doesn't turn into a bash-fest.

Also, check the type2 archives for the previous conversations on this
subject...


Have fun,

&gt; Hello everyone,
&gt; 
&gt; I'm curious as to what online sites everyone around here uses for bus
&gt; parts.
&gt; I'm looking for the best combination of quality and price.  Any suggestions?
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks,
&gt; Brian
