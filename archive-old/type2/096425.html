Subject: Re: [T2] Valve adj. wrench


Guys,

I figure my wrench that I use for that is expendable(non returnable), so 
years ago I took my closed end 13/15mm craftsman wrench and heated it up 
to red hot with a torch.  I put a offset in it of about 1/2&quot; for doing 
valves.


15mm end    ---------\
                      \
                       \__________13mm end

The bend is about an inch or so from the 13mm end.


Has worked great since 1972.  If the tool doesn't fit the job, and you are 
going to be doing that job a lot, then make it fit.....

Cheers, dave

&gt; I bought two new 13mm wrenches (12 point and a 6 point count on the boxes) 
&gt; just recently from Lowes.
&gt; 
&gt; They are the brand that they sell with their lifetime warranty.
&gt; I think their brand name is &quot;Kobalt&quot;, or some such.
&gt; 
&gt; The reason I bought these specific two wrenches was because of their 
&gt; geometry (flat shape, properly offset for a valve job)
&gt; The wrenches were pretty inexpensive, and have proven to be pretty proper 
&gt; for doing valve adjustments.
&gt; 
&gt; I think I like the 6 point wrench best for doing valve jobs.
&gt; There is ample swing room for a 6 point to find a fit when doing valve 
&gt; work, and a less likely chance to round off the valve lock nuts which, as 
&gt; we know, are going to be frequently wrenched.
&gt; 
&gt; Generally, I would prefer the 12 point design for most jobs.
&gt; 
&gt; I have decided to carry them in my &quot;most needed&quot; satchel of tools that I 
&gt; keep behind my driver's seat.
&gt; A pair of leather gloves in the same satchel serve as knuckle savers.
&gt; 
&gt; As a side note, I just bought a 2nd set of brand new 12 pt, (9mm thru 
&gt; 17mm), still in the wrapper, Sears Craftsman wrenches up at Dayton, OH the 
&gt; other week for $15.00 at a ham radio geekfest.
&gt; I had purchased the same identical set a couple of years ago for an amazing 
&gt; $10.00 at a muscle car show.
&gt; 
&gt; Good tools can be had at nice prices; so always keep your need list with 
&gt; you, and a folded 20 bill tucked away for safe keeping.
