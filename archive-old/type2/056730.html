Subject: Oil Leaks

After changing the oil in my '81, I decided to take a good look with the
oil filter removed.  It has a pretty bad oil leak, and I thought all this
time it was the pushrod tubes.  It isn't, they're fine.  It is leaking
pretty badly somewhere near the oil cooler, it's all covered.  The rear of
teh engine is a mess, the front is dry.  The valve covers are oozing a
bit, but even accounting for the spray from the cooling fan I doubt they
can be the sole source of all the oil.

So, is an oil cooler leak an in-vehicle repair?  Has anyone done this
lately?  I had the fan shroud off my Bus one time, but the Vanagon has
MUCH less room back there.  Will the shroud come off?  I put in an order
for the Bently, but I understand it is out of print?  Or maybe they were
just out and fed me that line.

Thanks,
Craig
