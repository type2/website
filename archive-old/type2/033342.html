Subject: Clutch Fork Conundrum
Content-Disposition: inline

I replaced my guide sleeve, TO bearing &amp; transmission oil seal a few months ago on my 71 westy. I also bought
new clutch fork bushings and a rubber sleeve individually, but found the rubber sleeve pretty lame and ended up reusing
my old one, but unfortunately mauling the inner circlip.  So, anticipating a long road trip to Florida in 3 weeks,
I'd like to go back in there and take care of business. Might be a good idea to have a replacement fork on hand, but...

On page 31 of the RMMW catalog, there are listings for clutch forks:
-002 141 701C  Clutch fork, 12-1600 motor, 61-67 bus
-002 141 701A  Clutch Fork 17-1800 motor, 71-75 bus
-002 141 701        Clutch Fork 1600 motor, 68-70 bus

Which would be correct for a 71 1600 bus?  Also I remember being able to buy a nice crossshaft kit for my 66 bus -
a baggie with the bushings, circlips and a gold metal sleeve &amp; rubber pieces from the Bug stop in pleasant Hill, CA
a few years ago. Are such 'crossshaft kits' made for the Bay Window buses, and if so, where to find?  Any comments etc.
appreciated.
