Subject: Vanagon into Bay

Here's the plan...

Have an '82 Vanagon 2 liter with a burnt valve.  Runs great on three 
cylinders. Fresh rebuild by a cut rate shop (SIR) 12k miles ago.  Have 
a '77 bay (Bleu) with a seriously tired motor. Leaks a quart of oil 
every hundred miles or so...

Plan is to pull the heads from each motor and have the '77 heads 
redone. Install on the '82 motor and have a cheap rebuild.

Any gotchas that I should be aware of?  I'm aware of the dipstick and 
breather differences.  Doesn't really seem to be a big deal.

Jim
