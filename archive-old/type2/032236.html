I have thought about this problem some.  Why can't we just cut the old
ones in half, refill them and then re-close them.  Reclosure should be
done with 1) exhaust patching material (use the pit of chicken wire
included in such kits, 2) JB weld? 3) a couple of big hose clamps, 4)
welding if available, 5) lots of high temp rubber bands ;)   I haven't
tried it, but what would be the harm if was a bit leaky?  I do think it
must have activated carbon in it, since the purpose of the filter is to
remove hydrocarbons from the recirculated exhaust gasses, and activated
carbon would be expected to have this property.  The disection which I've
described above should settel the matter.

Another aproach would be to find a similarlly sized EGR filter from
another vehicle which was cheap and then to use above methods to fit the
two ends of the pipe from yuor spent filter.
