Hi All,

Thanks Richard for the links. My next question: does
anyone know if at all, where I might go to find NEW
male &amp; female connectors to make a breakout box.  I
really don't want to sacrifice an old ECU and a wiring
harness to make this tool to check my Fuel Injection.

Any ideas????

Thanks,

Rae
