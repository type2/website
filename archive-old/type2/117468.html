&gt; I spent more money on my garden tractor paint and materials than you did

&gt; How could this be possible?

yeah how big is that garden tractor????

&gt; I was just busting chops this morning--I knew where this subject would
&gt; go---I've been here before--

well I wrote it up some months ago in a little more detail...personally it
didn't seem like much at the time, just a solution to a problem...I had
just bought the bus and I liked most everything about it EXCEPT the gowd
awfull babyshit green paint job it came from the factory with.  Barry
keeps trying to convince me it is a pretty color but.....I'm not buying

so I bought something called &quot;Custom Color&quot; from a local FLAPS (Salvo I'm
pretty sure) but it is a regular brand... will have to get a can from the
garage as I have a few left over and use em for touch ups when I do body
work and things...my bus is a bright white to below the windows and a dark
metalic blue below the windows, with a deep red one inch stripe seperating
the colors (which I am now replacing with Scotchlite reflective material)

&gt; It's Friday isn't it????

for about another 40 minutes around here
