Subject: 71Westy Shocks

Does anyone have a recommendation for shocks for a 71 Westy? Any brands 
that have proved to help ride etc. Do gas shocks make a difference? Is 
the regular, least expensive shock going to do the trick? What is the 
shock that would fit the 71 that maybe is listed by its other 
applications ( 74 Pinto, 86 Yugo, etc.)Would like to buy it 
locally. Thanks for the help in advance.
