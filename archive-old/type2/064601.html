Subject: '80 FI question

&gt;In putting the fuel injection back on my '80 vanagon, I'm confused as to
&gt;where the thermo-time switch goes.  I thought I labeled everything, but must
&gt;of missed this part.  This is the metal sensor with about 2.5 inch rod on
&gt;the end that connects to the wire harness to the ECU.  I think it goes under
&gt;the intake air distributor near intake no. 4.  Anybody with an AFC FI
&gt;vanagon know if it just gets bolted to the top of the engine?

I think you've got the ambient temperature sensor in hand.  It
bolts to an L shaped bracket on the top, nearly center (forward
and left a little, I think near the #3 intake tube) of the case.
It will be very tough to install after you've installed the
intake air distributor.

I think you have to remove and re-torque one of the case bolts
to install the bracket, but maybe I'm just thinking of the FI
ground terminals and the intake air distributor bracket, which
definitely require removing and re-torquing a few case bolts.

Email me if this isn't clear, and I'll go take a look-see on my
'80 vanagon.

Happy Installing!
Dennis
