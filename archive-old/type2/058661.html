Finally taking a cross country trip!
Left Fri PM and headed towards Chicago - 
slept on the road in Indiana and got to friends house by lunchtime 
Central time. It was opressively hot so I couldn't travel above 60.
Sun. went to the Woodstock Folk Festival- great time - excellent 
fiddle contest - headed west from Woodstock and made it till 
Worthington? Minn. Slept in a church parking lot and hit the road 
early.  It was getting cold Sun night and I was able to ave. 70 mph
The rebuilt motor did great except for MPH- down to 14- usually 18- 
It may have something to do with the Ethynol that was unavoidable in 
the middle of the night.
In Kimball SD I did something really stupid- left the gas cap along 
with the keychain with the key to my hitch lock, glove box and the 
water tank-- I called later that day and the guy said he would send 
it to me, I hope he does.
Anyway now my pregnant wife and I are in Hill City- at the base of Mt 
Rushmore. We are heading to see Crazy horse and from there Wyoming 
and Montana.
I've only seen two other campers- a white W/C Westy in the Bad Lands 
and a Blue camper like Dave Schwarze- BC tags- good shape though.
I think we will head south to Colorado before heading east later this 
week.
Wave if you see a '81 Assuan Brown Westy
'81 Westi- (re-re built),'80 Storage Shed
