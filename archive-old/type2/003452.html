Subject: Getting up and running


It has been awhile since I have been on the list
 
 I finally got my motor back together. It will be in my bus on Wednesday  I
 am so excited I can't wait I had taken it over to a friend of mine to do
 some final touches on it and it will be ready to go.
 
 Then I will be going on a big trip to Ontario I am leaving on the 8th of
 April and will be taking I 80 across the country starting in Vancouver and
 then going to Portland and then across the country.
 
 Hope to see some buses along the way
 
 
 Paul
