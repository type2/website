Subject: Paint job in Canada

After my bus in mechanically super sound I plan on taking a road trip to
Canada to visit the folks.

While I'm there maybe it would be a good idea to take advantage of the
mighty US dollar and use the exchange rate to afford a proper paint job.

Has anyone in Canada recently painted their bus that could give me an idea
of what they paid.
