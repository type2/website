Okay I need some help. I have a 1970 type II bus and I don't think the =
transmission is out. I start it right up I can get it going but its =
really hard to shift the gears. It's like its stuck in 3 rd gear but if =
I get underneath in and move the shit bar back and forth I can then get =
in it and it will allow me to shift, but its really hard to shift its =
lick slamming it gear and sometimes it does not work. I know the clutch =
works when I push down on the clutch it will engage. What could be the =
problem here and what would it cost to fix this problem.

Derrick
