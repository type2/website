Subject: [T2] Wheel questions...

I'm looking for chrome stock rims for my '73 Bus. It seems there VERY hard
to find. Does anyone know where I might find them?

Are stock steel road rims my only option? I would really like something with
a little more flash to them.

Lastly, can I put 15&quot; rims on (assuming I can find some)?
