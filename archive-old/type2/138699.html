&gt;hmmmm, would it go into the garage if you let some air out of the tires,
&gt;wouldn't be very convienent for daily parking but the occasional major
&gt;repair or to get it off the street for a few days it might work.


I had the same scenario in my last home. Basement Garage, I could get the 
Westy in there with low tires. But forget about most major work. Most major 
work requires the bus to be jacked up.

Later,
