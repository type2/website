Subject: what C/ratio for regular gas, 1911cc 75 Westy, towing 900#

I hope the list doesn't mind an x-post from the Type 4um, but I hope to 
get information from *all* the experts ;-)

I have a refurbished 1.8L T4 engine w/flycut 1.7L heads, ready to 
install. However, I am seriously considering removing the upper works 
and using my 96mm P&amp;C set on this engine, since I'd have to buy new 
pistons and maybe rods anyway when I build my &quot;big hauler&quot; 96X78. 
Anyway, I think I may buy a kit from Jake, so I might as well use this 
P&amp;C and get the advantage of the extra displacement now.

I set the C/R at 7.3 on the 1.8L on the recommendation of someone on 
ththis list; I'm now wondering if that is the upper limit for use on 
regular gas in Eastern USA.

Heads have no flow work down, induction is L-jet, w/plans for a 
Megasquirt in the future. Haven't chosen aftermarket ignition right now, 
so it is via double vacuum VW dizzy w/possible CDI addon. Valves are 
larger than the 1.8L valves; I wish I had my notes so I could say what 
size for sure, but they are stock on the 1.7L. Heads have been 
deflashed, cc'd and nothing else. Cooling system is stock T4.

The bus is a full Westy 4-spd. and I will carry a bit of camping 
equipment at all times, though not a potty, tent or canopy, etc. The bus 
will tow a boat sometimes, under 900 lbs total trailer wt. I live in the 
mountains of E TN and will likely climb to 5000' ele, but rarely. Most 
towing will be toward the flatland to the West.

How high a C/R can I run without risk of pinging??? If extra C/R would 
help power or economy, I can stand a bit of ping under heavy load, as I 
back off pretty quick.

TIA/Fader
