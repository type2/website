Subject: Re: [T2] fi to carbs on 78 2.0l??


&gt;.....lots of bad
&gt; memories and what have I realized?  I have NEVER had the K-jetronic fuel
&gt; injection on any of my VW's ever bring me to a halt.

In the past 7 years I have had two EFI failures that brought me to a halt. 1st
one was a double relay that gave up. 2nd happened on the way to Jerome 2 weeks
ago = lost injector power because of the harness failure. I did not cut the
harness open, just replaced it and the bus runs great. Expensive tow bill from
Barstow to Fresno for that one
