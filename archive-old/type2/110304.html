Subject: Pertonix Ignitor and 78 Bus

I bought a Pertronix ignitor model  1847 V and a 40511 coil to go with it.
Has anyone had the following experience?  After mounting the igniter unit to
the place where the points used to be, I put the magnetic collar around the
distributor shaft,  Then I found the distributor rotor would not go on far
enough to engage the internal protrusion with the slot on the distributor.
The magnetic collar would not let it go down far enough.  So I cut about 1/4
inch off the bottom of the rotor so it would engage the shaft.  Hooked up
all the wires and nothing NADA, not a spark anywhere.  I put my points back
in and gapped them but had no ignition, even at the coil.   Ideas greatly
appreciated, especially from anyone who can confirm that the 1847V is the
correct model for a fuel injected 78 2.0 liter.  The distributor is stock as
far as I know. It has vacuum advance and probably centrifugal as well.  

I am bummed out
