Subject: Roof rack question:

I recently picked up a roof rack at a local VW show, and the person
selling it said it was &quot;original VW&quot;.  It had a blue sticker on it
with a ZVW number on it.  Were VW option items marked with the ZVW
code, or was this some other aftermarket company that marks thier
items with this code?

Thanks!
