Anyone actually done this? I've seen the dye in the spray cans at the store 
but will the results be worth a damn?

What sort of durability?

What should I pre-clean the dash with?

Planning on dyeing my dash to match the door panels (my own custom color 
choices) as I begin to restore the interior using new fabric patterns and 
colors never offered on the Westy.

I have an white over Tornado red exterior and plan on black rubber floor 
mats inside (everywhere - front and back). I always track lots of mud 
inside so the rubber mats are easier to clean than carpet.

I'm replacing the front OEM seats which are very worn out on the driver's 
side with a pair of very nice GTI seats from a Italian spec diesel I picked 
out of a junkyard when I lived over there about 6 or 7 years ago. They have 
a nice black and charcoal cover sprinkled with colors. I'm modifying them 
to mount to the Westy seat track.

We haven't decided what colors inside the bus through. We may stay with the 
seat colors that the GTI had or might go with a reddish plaid or plain 
reddish color - cloth one way or another. Same on the door panels.

Haven't decided on the dash color but naturally leaning towards matching 
the dash to the seats. Not to get anyone into a huff but this is (was) a 
Champagne edition but the dash is fading to spots of black here and there. 
It's going to need to be dyed one way or another. Also will dye the A/C unit.

Any color suggestions? Or off-color suggestions? &lt;grin&gt;
