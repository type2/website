Subject: RE: [T2] Dwell on this



It might work(barring differences in advance characteristics), but the 
chances of failure using parts and technology that old are substantial.  I 
would recommend carrying points around should you go that route.  If the 
partsare readily available to you though, then by all means give it a try!

What about using an early (up to 85?) vanagon distributor?  Aren't they CDI?
Use the dizzy, mount the &quot;brain&quot; on the fan shroud.  Just cut a little hole
in the back of the fan shroud, and mount the &quot;brain&quot; over the hole so that
it has air blowing over it at all times to cool it.  Maybe I'm way off here,
but I believe I remember seeing that done before. (on a T1 engine)  Then
you're using all VW parts too...

For that same price, you can get the Crane CDI.  It comes with the optical
trigger(replaces the points) and the CDI 'brain'.  The brain is an epoxy
encapsulated unit with a beefy heatsink on it that mounts remotely(in my
case on the firewall), triggering the coil, and adjusting the dwell.
