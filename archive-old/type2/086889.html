&gt; I'd like to take my bus on a long highway trip and would like suggestions on 
&gt; what parts of the front suspension I should change to make the bus feel a 
&gt; little more solid at freeway speeds.  I'm considering buying torsion arms w/ 
&gt; ball joints already installed (set of 4 from Bus Boys, I believe...), new tie 
&gt; rods w/ ends, rebuilt steering box and new steering damper.  Do I need anything 
&gt; else?  Would anyone suggest anything else?  I'm at a point where I can spend 
&gt; some money and would like to do it right.  What about the 4-holed steering 
&gt; coupler?  Any reason to replace that?

yes replace the 4holed steering coupler.  also check the condition of the
front beam, many are badly rusted on the inside.   

&gt; Any comments on lowering the bus?  I see specialized parts for this.  I assume 

don't bother, buses have a reason for being the height they are

&gt; the busses had so much ground clearance to go offroad for camping, etc.  Would 
&gt; lowering the bus help?  How difficult is this?  This bus is entirely original 

it's a lot of work

&gt; (has been in my family since day 1, had nothing done to it.  My uncle owned it 
&gt; and put no money into it.)

keep it stock
