Subject: The Steering Situation
To: Type2_at_type2_dot_com

Greetings to the List,

I have a 1970 Transporter and I am experiencing a little problem with the 
steering.  It seems to have a small &quot;dead spot&quot; in the center of the steering 
arc.  Mind you, the steering &quot;feel&quot; seems very good except for this 
particular spot.  As one swings the wheel around (in motion under a load) it 
just seems to skip over this spot.  That's about as well as I can describe it.
I've talked to a couple of other member from the list with 70 Buses and they 
are experiencing the same thing.  I know the steering box for this bus is 
expensive and cranky.
So..........the question is..........is this normal for a 1970 Bus?  And if 
it is not, is it indicative of a potential disaster?  Anything I can do short 
of replacing the steering box?

Thanks!

Mike
