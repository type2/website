Subject: [T2] 1600 in a 73 bus? What do I do?

Here it goes,

     I have a 1973 Bus that had a 1800cc engine that I moved into my 75 and 
now I have a bus with no engine.  I have found a possible 1600 that I could 
buy and put into my 73.  What special parts(if any) do I need to do this?  
Is this procedure difficult?  Will I need special tin?  Any help would be 
greatly appreciated, also if you have ever done the procedure let me know 
how it went.

Peace
