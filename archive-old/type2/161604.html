Subject: RE: [T2] Bug Blocks Burn!

   I am curious -- is this a common thing or is it just an Oregon thing? I 
remember growing up in Oregon burning VW engines at beach campouts was not 
uncommon at all. It was almost expected -- kinda like roasting marshmellows.

&gt;After BugRun 21 this last Saturday at Woodburn
Anyway, on Saturday
&gt;night, they burned an old 1600 bug-style engine block.
&gt;  Wow!  That was bright.
