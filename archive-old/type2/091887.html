&gt;When we got to Canada we had to go through Customs.  The Customs officer
&gt;asked if I had any alcohol or tobacco as well as the other usual questions,
&gt;and I said that I didn't.  We planned to buy all ours in Canada, go exchange
&gt;rate!   That must have seemed suspicious because we got selected to go off
&gt;to the side to have our declarations verified :-)
&gt;The very curteous and professional Canadian Customs inspectors gave the Bus
&gt;a quick look-through to make sure we weren't hiding beer &amp; cigarettes and
&gt;sent us on our way.

Living in Niagara Falls, I get checked every time i go over.  It's not 
random selection, it's obvious prejudice towards my van, because they 
don't stop me in my plymouth...  Anyway, i've learned some things about 
customs officials.  The westy spare tire compartment baffles them.  They 
know it opens, but they can't figure out how, so instead of looking 
stupid, they just pass over it.  Also, the spare tire well in the rear 
closet of my westy is safe.  I accidentally forgot about a bottle of 
scotch i had in there, and they didn't find it, because they didn't know 
it was there...

The best part about it is when they come up empty handed :-P
