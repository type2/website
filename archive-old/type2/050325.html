Subject: [T2] Parts in Europe

Mary Beth and I will arrive Zurich on March 17, then after a few days, on 
to Munich, then on to Northern Italy.

Anybody over there need any bus bits and pieces from USA that are hard to 
find in Europe?

I'll be glad to help you out.
May be a dumb question, but ........ Let me know.
