Subject: RE: [T2] Bus Depot's Service, long complaint --- Let's stop
  befor e it starts!!!

Can we not start another long thread about service and the Bus Depot?  Phil
already apologized so let this thread die, please!!!!!!  There are so many
more entertaining things that we could waste our bandwidth on.

&gt;here we go again, Ron gets beaten up on more than GEX, why is that, maybe
&gt;because he is avaliable and he traditionally provides the better service he
&gt;is held to a higher standard????
