Subject: Re: [T2] CV joint tool type and size

mine (also 70 bus) was an allen wrench (sorry, i dont know what size) but
i was sold the star shaped bit by a VW supplier to install the new bolts
that came with the new boot kit. i still dont know why the old bolts
werent stars. i figured that was why he sold me the bit. i was about to
take it back when i realized the new bolts needed it. whew!
