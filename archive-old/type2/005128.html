The true shear bolts hold the column to the body. They are part # 211 415
549 and were used from vin #214 2164 060.
The bolt Brad removed is a tamper proof bolt to hold the steering lock to
the column to slow down thieves and has nothing to do with collapsing in an
accident.
When you get in an accident and you run into something in front of you, your
momentum and your body pushes the column forward. The shear bolts holding
the column to the body shear and the column moves forward.



&gt; &gt;shoulder. It is designed to shear the head off when you tighten it,
making
&gt; &gt;it 'tamper-proof'. It is not really soft, it just has a designed weak
spot.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt;Is the tamper proof bolt really
&gt; &gt;&gt; a shear bolt? Is that why it's so soft?
&gt;
&gt; NO, the point of these bolts is NOT to be tamper proof.  Bill assumes
&gt; correctly, those bolts are designed to shear at a particular torque to
&gt; provide a particular clamping force.  They are not &quot;soft&quot; per say, just
&gt; turned down like they are they carry a very accurate torque and shear.
&gt; Prior to their &quot;invention&quot; the column was suspended with a number of
&gt; nylon washers and the bolts had very narrow torque specifications
&gt; (this in '73ish era I think with the one year? column support.)  With the
&gt; invention of the shear bolts all those stupid washers that had to be
&gt; in all the correct locations with correctly torqued bolts ceased.  Those
&gt; bolts are integral to how and when your column collapses in a front
&gt; impact and need to be replaced with the correct parts, furthermore they
&gt; are available and are cheap.  I think RMMW even has the things for
&gt; nothing essentially.
&gt;
&gt; USE THE RIGHT PARTS.  You got very little in front of you and you
&gt; don't want a steering wheel as part of your chest.
&gt;
&gt; Sorry I've meant to nip this one before when people asked, can I just
&gt; use a....
