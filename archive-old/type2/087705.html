&gt;Please realize that you are not allowed to use any tools bearing VW part

&gt;factory manuals.  :-)

Now that was funny as hell.  After all VW tools bear VW tool numbers
for which VW undoubtedly still has some little know German patent
in effect on which entitles only VW and its authorized agents in authorized
facilities to handle said tools else be punished with stiff fines,
imprisonment,
or general german but whooping.

Remember when VW was actually a nice company????  Oh that was when
they still made good cars....
