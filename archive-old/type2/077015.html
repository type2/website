&gt; A friend of mine recently took her 78 westy to the shop and they attributed

&gt; urgent, i am just curious how much pressure would be pushing upwards towards 
&gt; that switch and the threads that hold it in?

sounds like a scam or something to me,  My 78 2liter lifts the presure
relief valve about 70psi and it will pretty much stay about 55 with more
than 1500rpms on the engine...doesn't drop below 20 at any time.  I run
5w-50 synthetic all the time.
