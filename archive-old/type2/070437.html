&gt; That idea was for simplicity.  So much for trying to
&gt; keep things simple.  I'm afraid that I will need bumpers
&gt; for inspection.  I wont have them, and will be bummed.
&gt;
I have always had no trouble finding front bumpers, but rear bumpers are
another story. I actually have the correct one for my '67, but as I'm running a
Beetle exhaust, I didn't want to cut the bumper.
SO, I put on a lovely piece of treated 4x4, which will serve as ample
protection. It is painted to match the bus, and actually looks nice...
It was also only a couple bucks...
