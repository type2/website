Subject: [T2] Vanagon windshield install thoughts.

This weekend Steve Dolan came over (to deliver a 1500 sp for
rebuild I thought but he forgot it 8-) so instead we installed a
windshield into his '80 to replace his rather cracked one.  This
is the first Vanagon windshield I've pulled and I thought I'd share
some thoughts.

First, rust is always worse than it looks.  This I knew of course
but I think Steve was a bit suprised by just how bad a bit bubbling
in one corner ended up being.  He took some digital pics after I
sandblasted it all clean and there were quite a few 1/4&quot; holes
perforating the bad corner.  Maybe he'll put em up.  Of course
you also want to start this before the 7pm when we got the glass
out of the car.

Second, never do this in winter.  It seems I always forget this
one, the '78, '70, and this one I've all done in the dead of WV winter
with snow on the ground.  Even in a 60F garage fiberglass cures
slow and paint is unbareably slow.  A neat tip I have been using
though is a laquer (available again, whoo, hoo) primer surfacer that
uses acetone to thin instead of laquer thinner.  I bought this stuff
cause it was cheap, but it sprays beautifully and most of all, flashes
INSTANTLY, sandable in 10 minutes even at 60F.  A rec against
in the new cheapo PPG line called OMNI-AE (the acryllic enamel.)
This stuff is utter junk, and I can see why PPG doesn't put their
name on it.  Very low solids, would take at least 6 coats to cover
on a beige Vanagon.  5 on the nose of mine still shows primer in
spots and 3 on Steves didn't begin to cover the primer.  JUNK.
A plus to the cheapo Chuck Homier touch up gun I bought for
$15 to replace my old cheapo $10 one that broke after 10 years.
It sprayed nicely enough for what it cost and I didn't have to
break out and clean up the good Sharpe HVLP.

Third.  The vanagon is an easy pull, much nicer than a darn
baywindow.  Center it, one wrap of cord, it pulled like a gem.  A
good tip is to throw the rubber in an old blanket in the dryer
for about 10 minutes prior to install in colder weather, if you
work fast can really help.  This time used aerosol silicone instead
of soap like I usually do and it did nicely, don't know if it was
better because of that or not.

Lastly, install the stupid trim strip.  Duh, we forgot this one, I
had it all ready, but at 2:00 AM somewhere between taking
the seal out of the dryer and rushing to the car as the silicone
spray dried off, we forgot to put it in.  The seal fits loosely
without it, and its going to leak.  But that is a problem for another
day I guess.  The early vanagon seal like bays is not glued in,
probably sensible to do so in reality, I usually follow up the
install using the thing flowable Permatex windshield silicone
under the lip.  That will stop future dirt and water infiltration that
wears the paint off under the rubber to cause the rust.  We didn't
do it this time because it has to come out again for the trim
but we will on the permanent install.
