&gt;&gt; what i found even more disturbing in reading the CARB info website is that
&gt;&gt; to get credit for removing a vehicle it need to be destroyed 100% and NO
&gt;&gt; parts can be resold or reused. This, right after thery state how they are
&gt;&gt; sensitive
&gt;&gt; about the concerns of collectors of vintage autos. They speak with for-ked
&gt;
&gt;Not even Body parts, which hardly contribute to air pollution?????

You can't buy a thing off of a Vehicle Retirement Program car. The state is paying for them to be removed. I had my eye on a late loaf at a yard. It was in the holding lot. I went back 2 days later and it was gone. I figured it was out in the yard. No, it wasn't any where. I asked what happened. It was a VRP car and it got crushed. It was a beautiful sun roof loaf......
