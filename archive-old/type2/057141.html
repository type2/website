Subject: RE:  I can't believe this! (oil leak)

&gt;So, guess what? After about 5 miles, I see some leakage, looking 
&gt;like from the rear seal. Then, after about 20 miles, oil is blowing all

&gt;over the engine again. Even worse than before -- like a quart in 15 
&gt;miles!  It's impossible to see where it's coming from, since the 
&gt;whole engine is covered with oil, top to bottom. Before it got bad, 

Sounds like my experience a few years ago on the 1.7 in my 73.  I
replace the rear seal and was surprised at how easily it went in.  Made
the test drive and discovered much to my horror that it was still
leaking.  So I replaced it again.  This time I though, &quot;I'll use a
little sealant - that'll fix the bugger&quot;.  Wrong!  Still leaked like a
sieve.  

I was suspicious because each of the seals I put in seemed to go in
easier than I thought they were supposed to.  So back to my VW FLAPS.  I
told them of my problem and the guy behind the counter laughed and said,
&quot;What you need is the GERMAN seal, not those Brazilian pieces of junk&quot;
(that he had sold me the previous day no less)!  So I paid the extra $1
and got the &quot;good&quot; seal.  Had to install it with a homemade tool
comprised of a stud, a nut, and a really big washer.  This baby was
TIGHT.  Fixed the leak!
