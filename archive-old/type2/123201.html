&gt; &gt;Are you running a 914/ 411 engine with D jetronic in your bus??
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Bus engines in the FI flavor were only 1.8 and 2.0L, L jetronic FI

I have used a 411 1.7 engine in my bus as a spare engine and I would also
swap in the L jetronic FI from my 2liter,  it never had any problems with
the switch and ran fine.
