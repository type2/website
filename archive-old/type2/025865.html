Hi Volks,

I have a 79 Bus, and I had a turn signal outage just prior to EB2001. It
came on all-of a sudden, and affected the turn signals, emergency flashers
and the dash lights.

I checked the relays to no avail, and was even more frustrated when the dash
lights would sometimes come on when I hit a bump.

As it turned out, it was just that a spade connector on the ground wire
going to the back of the speedometer had come off its post.

If you were working under the dash, you might have dislodged that wire, it
couldn't hurt to check. That's my experience, YMMV.

Happy trails,

Greg Potts

&gt; 
&gt;&gt; So, are the reverse lights controlled by the same switch that I have
&gt;&gt; ordered?  My turn signals had ceased to work after my painful heater cable
&gt;&gt; replacement, so I have no idea if the back up lights stopped working at the
&gt;&gt; same time.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; If it is not the same switch, where should I begin to look?
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; I have an automatic transmission.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; I'm glad you mentioned you have an automatic, because that changes the
&gt; answer.  First, no, the reverse lights have nothing to do with the hazard
&gt; flasher switch.
&gt; 
&gt; On an automatic Bus, the reverse lights are controlled via a switch in the
&gt; base of the shifter on the cab floor.  You may have to get in there and
&gt; take a look.  While you're in there you can get the light that lights up
&gt; the gear selector display at night working :-)
&gt; 
&gt; On a manual transmission Bus, the switch is actually screwed into the side
&gt; of the transmission and power comes from the ignition coil.  I'm not sure
&gt; if the automatic version is powered via the coil or not (don't have the
&gt; Bentley handy).
