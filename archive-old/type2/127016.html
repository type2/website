Subject: Stripped Spark Plug Hole on 1.8

The number three spark plug hole on my 1975 Westy is
stripped, which causes the sparkplug to occasionally
fire out.  I would appreciate any repair suggestions. 
Do I have to take the engine out to do this repair? 
Anyone ever done fixed this problem have any advice?

Thanks.
