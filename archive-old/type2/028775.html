&gt;The correct parts for a 68-71 are:
&gt;211 298 009A muffler kit
&gt;211 298 055 damper to tail pipe kit
&gt;211 251 301A bracket
&gt;211 251 051 E muffler
&gt;147 251 157 damper pipe
&gt;211 251 237B tail pipe



I sell all of the above as a complete kit for $95 after listmember discount.
Normally I ship all original-equipment German parts (Leistritz or Ernst).  I
do ship Danish parts when German is unavailable.  Never Brazilian, save
perhaps a tailpipe where supply requires it.

Last I checked we were substituting a Danish part here and there. But I can
also tell you that my new shipment from Germany, due in about 3 weeks, will
contain about 30 100% German kits. So it's a matter of how much of a hurry
you're in.  I can say definitively that either is FAR superior to the
Brazilian ones commonly sold for the same (or higher!) price.  Frankly, with
a good system selling for under $100, you'd be crazy to even consider
anything less.
