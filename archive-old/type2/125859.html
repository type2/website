Subject: Re: [T2] new solex 35 carbs

  Have used a few sets, am building a 1904 and will also use them on it. Don't really like the cast iron OE VW manifolds 
they come with though. Linkage is good and a good selection of jets are available. They are also going to come out 
with 38 mm Solexs soon. When Scat came out with theirs I stopped using CB Performance 34's. They do fit right on to 
the 1700 and 1800 type 4 manifolds. They have been available for a few months now.

&gt;there is a new solex 35mm dual carburetor kit with electric chokes 
&gt;available from SCAT.  Has anyone tried these?  I was thinking about 
&gt;buying the kit and replacing my old, worn out  single progressive weber 
&gt;on my 74 Westy (2.0L).   Any info would be greatly appreciated.  
&gt;Thanks.
