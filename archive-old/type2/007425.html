Subject: My 74 sunroof bus for sale
Date: Sat, 24 Oct 1998 16:22:43 PDT

Hey Y'all
   I got the 74 Bus home and worked on it today, I got it to run and to 
move around, but it does not idle very good. I think that it needs the 
carbs to be cleaned out.
   I want to sell it whole, but I will consider parting it out. Let me 
know if you are interested, I need to sell it as soon as possible. So 
come look and hear it run, then make me an offer. I will sell it cheap. 
It only need a few things to make it a driver.
