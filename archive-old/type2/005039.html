I have a 75 Westy that has been sitting about three years w/o running FI
1800 engine. Interior in very good condition. #3 has 0 compression (burnt
valve); a couple of exhaust studs stripped, body looks good, but the
undercarriage is very rusted out. . Easily towed as all tires and joints OK.
If you have a good use for it, all you have to do is tow it away.  Want to
camperize a bus?  I would rather give it to someone that can use it rather
than junk it and have it crushed.  It is located in Columbus, Ohio
