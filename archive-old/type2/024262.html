Subject: Re:  78 windsheild wipers don't work
Message-ID: &lt;7icuen$lj63_at_eGroups_dot_com&gt;

I have a 78 westy and had a similar problem. Mine was 
caused by a chaffed wire on the harness where the motor
plug is, it was fine when I was troubleshooting it with 
the emergency brake on in my driveway. As soon as it was
raining(on the highway, turn on the switch, pop goes 
the fuse.) So I found the wire the brake linkage was 
chaffing and it has been working fine since then. Hope 
this was a help.

&gt; Hey Volks,
&gt; 
&gt; Almost done sorting out my first Westy ('78 2.0L, FI,
&gt; auto). PO had it sitting for 2 years, It now *runs*
&gt; (compression 120,125,100,135) and *drives*.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; I need to get the windshield wipers to work. The
&gt; wipers blow the fuse when I switch them on. Any
&gt; testing tips, or suggestions on where to start whould
&gt; be appreciated. 
&gt; 
&gt; Did what I like to call the &quot;Inspection Dance&quot; this
&gt; weekend. This is when you walk around the van to see
&gt; if all the lights (directional, brake, reverse, etc.)
&gt; work. Fixed the the directionals and hazard lights,
&gt; and I can't seem to figure out whats shorting out the
&gt; wipers. 
&gt; 
&gt; TIA
