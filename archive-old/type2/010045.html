Subject: FI harnesses - a poll
Message-Id: &lt;199907021631.JAA29262_at_helix.ucsd_dot_edu&gt;

I am looking for a little summer income. Usually, I write the indexes for 
books to supplement my income, but it is tedious. So I am thinking about 
weaving FI harnesses instead. I would set up a test to check quality.

Poll:

How much would you be willing to pay for a fresh harness?

Could you live without having the wire numbers printed on each wire?

Can you think of any improvements to the stock harness?

P-mail to me, not the list.
