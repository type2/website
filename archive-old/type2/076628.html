Subject: Woohoo

Hello list, long time listener - first time caller....

Just got an e-mail from Raby's VW - my bus is currently on it's test run 
with a new engine (first time it's moved under it's own power in almost 
half-a-year). I had the priveledge of trading a perfectly good running '73 
Super for this bus, then driving it 3 weeks before Jake discovered half the 
cam and bearings in the oil.

It will get quite the break-in tonight since I live over 2 hours away from 
his shop. More to follow. Yippeee!

Here are the few shots of it I was able to take before it pooped out on me..
