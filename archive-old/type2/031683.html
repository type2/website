&gt; I have a 2000cc fuel injected engine that is running pretty well, but I am

&gt; be stronger than my current 2000cc.  Is this true and if so how?   Will I

$50 for a good running 1800, I would grab it, mothball it and keep it as a
spare, when/if something happens to your 2L stuff in the 1800 while you
rebuild it.

as for the 1800 being better than the 2L,  not in my book and I've had em
both.
