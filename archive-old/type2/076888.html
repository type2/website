This must be a common problem.  One of my screws is missing and all but one
are so stripped you can't tighten them more than finger tight.  Keep meaning
to fix it before the pan falls off at speed.  I don't think there are
supposed to be sheet metal 'quick nuts' on there, the chassis members would
probably be too thick.  I think they were just 'self tapped' at the factory.
The best way I can think of to fix it would be to drill out the holes to 3/8
and pop in some of those rivet nutsert jobbies, size M6.  Only trouble is, I
don't have the tool and they're not all that cheap.  One day...

Just for the record, listees, my bus is a '78 and came with the belly pans
(we are talking about the *other* belly pans now, class).  They are M-code
191 I believe.  I don't know the definitive answer to why they are there
either.  Maybe someone could compile a table of buses with them fitted and
deduce what features are common to all.  Information we would need to know
would include country of import, converter (if a camper), year, model etc.
I would be happy to do this 'research' if people want to mail me details
(off-list obviously).
