just out of curiosity do you know how much the VW dash clock draws??

Bob

&gt; Using a digital VOM, you want to read milliamps. Just using a testlight, you
&gt; may have enough of a draw to light the light but it may only be drawing 50 or
&gt; 100 milliamps. Not enought to drain a battery until a month goes by, like a
&gt; quartz clock running. Using the cable-to-battery post 'size of spark' to gauge
&gt; the amount of draw is a little false.... it may be the clock winding on an
&gt; older analog clock. It draws a lot to get it moving, but is not constant.
&gt; 
&gt; A domelight will draw 600 to 700 milliamps. This will kill a fully charged
&gt; battery in 2 to 3 days. 600 to 700 ma is 1/3rd of an amp per hour draw. 500ma
&gt; is 1/2 an amp. 1000ma is 1 amp. Amperage is measured in one hour increments.
&gt; Just like your example of the battery being rated at 60 amphours. That is the
&gt; amount of a constant load, 60 amps, that will drain the battery to zero in one
&gt; hour.  i.e. 1000ma = 1 amp = 24 amps per
&gt; day.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Get an ammeter (good VOM's usually have this function to at least 5
&gt; &gt; amps).  In the dark, repeatedly touch the positive lead briefly onto the
&gt; &gt; + terminal- the size of the spark will tell you the load.  Put the VOM
&gt; &gt; between the pos terminal and the lead when it's set to ammeter function-
&gt; &gt; will tell you the draw.   Hmmm- how big a draw will drain a 60 amp hr
&gt; &gt; battery to below 9 volts in 2 days?

&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;&lt; The big thing to remember, while testing for a &quot;leak&quot; in your
&gt; electrical
&gt; &gt; &gt; system.... make sure you have the dome lights off,, and if you have a
&gt; radio
&gt; &gt; &gt; with
&gt; &gt; &gt; preset memory,,, it will cause a small glow in the lamp also,, you might
&gt; want
&gt; &gt; &gt; to
&gt; &gt; &gt; disconnect it also. &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Absolutely left field battery drain: Buddy of mine put a recycled radio in
&gt; his
&gt; &gt; &gt; work truck. Same problem, every few days the battery would be flat. Turned
&gt; &gt; &gt; out to be a short in the auto antenna circuit...Thing was trying to raise
&gt; a
&gt; &gt; &gt; fixed
&gt; &gt; &gt; antenna...
