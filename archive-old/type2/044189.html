&gt; i was reinstalling my push rod tubes (72 westy, stock engine) and i stripped
&gt; one of the bolts that holds the rocker arm to the head, Bently lists it as
&gt; quality 6 G. Does this mean i cant go to a local hard ware store and buy a
&gt; new bolt? Do i have to go to the dealer?

Home Depot has grade-8 metric bolts, as do some FLAPS. If you've got a
Grainger in your area and they'll sell to you (they only sell to
businesses), they've got Grade 8 bolts too. Also try the local Caterpillar
dealer. There are six grades of bolts out there--grade 2 through grade 8,
though it's uncommon to see grades 4 or 7. If you're dealing with a headed
bolt and not a stud, look at the head for little radial marks. Grade 2
doesn't have any. Grade 3 has one, grade 4 has two, grade 5 three, you get
the idea.

Now my question is, how did you manage to strip a grade-6 bolt?
