Subject: RE: [T2] extra battery wireing....

Here is what I did for hooking up my Aux battery. 
With the two relay method you can still start the bus when the Aux battery
is completely dead and still have full voltage to the starter from the main
battery with no drain from the Aux battery when you turn the key over.
Use the appropriate Amp ratting relay _at_ 30 Amp or better and I used 10g wire
from main battery to the relay and to the Aux battery.
This is always a heated subject (if not a FART) and there are many different
ways and theories on how to do this.
This has worked well for me, enjoy.

Subject: [T2] extra battery wireing....


cant remember whom i talked with on this but help me here if you might..?
thought i had saved the email but must of deleted it by accident...?
 
i have an extra battery.... as of now i am running this extra battery for my
radio... each day chargeing it at night..... and sitting it back down in the
passenger floor board the next morning.....
i was thinking that i can keep this battery charged all the time by the
alternator as well as the one that is back in the cab with the engine.......
i will not at that time have my radio hooked to the spare battery but yet
will have the radio hooked to the switch so that when i crank up the radio
will be on...also must find a main source so that the clock and all will be
right....and keep my stations....i am guessing this will be the same source
as that of where the wire from the + battery post wil go as well? and the
positve for the radio?
 
the spare battery is so that i can use it for cooking and lights and other
accessories that i have in the bus...for camping and what nots....
 
ok i think i am right but cant remember 
 
something about hooking a wire from battery + to a source that is on when
the bus is cranked or the switch comes on? which would this be.... in the
fuses... and could i hook to a fuse...?
and then ground the battery with another wire...?to the bus frame or
wherever i can get a good ground....?
 
dont want to fry nothing but really need to see this the extra battery thing
work........?
 
 
i remember this being simple when i read it but some how since i havent been
working in that area of the bus and i have made it difficult...~!~
 
thanks and peace
Chris
