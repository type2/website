Hello all,

        Just to add myself into all this talk about mufflers, I just
bought a cheapy cheapo muffler from JC Whitney. It came with a little
rust already on it. It came with one tailpipe port, not 2. It also was
very hard to get in, needed alot of coaxing. My question is, should I be
afraid of what a single tail pipe is going to do? I also need to know if
anybody out there knows a good source for the carpet underpadding for a
71 bus, (not camper). But back to the muffler, it always pays to listen
to what you guys have to say, I thought I could save around $100, which
is alot of money to me, by going with a so called stock replacement, but
I already have a queasy feeling in my stomach. I'll post the results of
what happens when I fire her up tomorrow.

Thanks from a humbled novice,
Nate
