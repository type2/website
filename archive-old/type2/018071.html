I'd second that and guess that he's not a member of this list. There's a
heck of a lot of generous people on this list (probably at least 50%
&gt;from US but including maybe 15 other countries) and I think that it kind
of grows on you. Maybe we just keep doin what we're doin and he'll
notice us and mellow out. (Maybe not, too,though.)
