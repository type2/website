&gt; Jim, 1968-1971 had mag cases stock, as did all those vintage years. as

&gt; aluminum, thank God!

From what I understand, the wasserboxer cases were made of aluminum.  They
were also made to the same dimensions as a type1 case, but with the
addition of a water jacket.  Some have taken the wasserboxer case, cut off
the water jacket, and built it up as an aircooled engine.

Sounds wierd, but apparently the case is a lot tougher than a magnesium
case.
