&gt;  By that competitive-edge logic, couldn't one also argue that you

One certainly could argue that. But then you'd be driving a Subaru with 
a VW wrapper. It's what's inside that counts.

Actually, I've relaxed about this Subaru conversion thing. But I still 
never want to read a &quot;what's the best antifreeze for my bus&quot; thread on 
this list. My dream is a double cab with six-banger Porsche engine. And 
AC.
