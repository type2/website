&gt;I broke one of the fan blades off trying to get the bolts loose on the 
&gt;fan, how much will the missing blade throw off the balance of the fan,  
&gt;does it have to be fixed?

While it won't kill you engine, I'd definitely recommend finding a
replacement.  Used fans are not terribly expensive (like $5-$20?) and are
pretty easy to come by.  I expect the missing blade will cause a slight
imbalance and could eventually shorten your engine's bearing's life a
little. 

&gt;My brake servo is not connected to any vacuum how much loss of 
&gt;braking does this cause?

Vacuum assist brakes is for WIMPS!!  Be a macho-man and drive unassisted!
Seriously, though, the lack of power assist does not affect your bus's
braking ability, just the amount of effort to push the pedal.
