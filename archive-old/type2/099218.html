Subject: Re: [T2] BMW, Get a hint VWoA

I agree.  VW &quot;has done&quot; air-cooled and moved on.  Look at the 
maintenance factors and the profit for them and see why they made that 
design.  VW may not provide super service and part for us owning 
air-cooled, but they are not a &quot;dumb&quot; company.

&gt;Not a chance...VW is aiming to be be one of the last four or five auto-
&gt;makers left standing in ten years and will have even less connection
&gt;to the original air-cooleds.
