Subject: Re: stuck seat

Jacks are real handy for body work too. I bought a 71 Deluxe Clipper for
$300. The only major problem being that the nose was caved in on the drivers
side. I put a piece of plywood over the front of the wheel well then went
the hydraulic jack, 2x4, and a thick, folded up, fiberglass mat on the
inside of the nose (to more evenly distribute the pressure). Slowly I jacked
until. . . . THONK!! The nose popped into position with only a few minor
wrinkles.


&gt;I've been trying off and on for a few days trying to get the front seat
free 
&gt;from its rusted tracks. I sprayed Kroil along the tracks and did a little 
&gt;hammering from time to time with no results. Last night I noticed there 
&gt;seemed to be room between the seat and the metal pedestal back to insert a 
&gt;compact scissors jack  A couple of turns on the scissors jack and the seat 
&gt;slid quietly free. Hope this tactic is of use to someone.
