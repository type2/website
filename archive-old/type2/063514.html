Subject: Confused! 20w50? 15w40? 10w30? ACK!

hey now,

okay, i've been told several different things by different folks.
i'm looking for a winter oil. BUT, here are my winter conditions:

a) i'm in central nc.
b) i'd say average winter temp is 35-40 or so.
c) it ofter gets below freezing...
d) once in a while 15-25
e) RARELY it gets below 15.

i've been told 20w50 is too heavy for this climate. i'm told folks round
here run this weight all the time. i'm told 10w30 is for colder climates.
i'm told 10w30 is good for this climate. i'm told 15w40 is a good alternative.
ack! ack! ack! ack! ack!

opinions?
