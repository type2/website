Subject: Re: [T2] Wire Disconnected from Fuse Box

Shawn,

The solid brown connects to the body at one end and terminal 5 on the turn
signal switch at the other.

I kind of blew it on the brown wire side of the diagnostic. Once you get
into the brown wires, you need to change the test procedure!  One nice
thing about VW is that brown *always* = brown, unless it is a DPO-supplied
wire.  To test grounds, you need to switch your VOM from volts to ohms
(any range will do).  First, attach the black lead to bright metal on the
body (your test ground).  Then  make sure it is really a ground by
attaching the other test lead to a different part of the body.  Resistance
should go from infinity to 0.  Having done that, go to the brown wire and
make sure it does the same thing.  go to termial 5 on the turn signal
switch  and see if there is not a brown wire already attached.  If there
is not, then atttach the loose wire to  it.  If there is, check it for
resistance to the body.  there ought to be none.  at that point, make sure
the key is off in the ignition and the lights are off, then check terminal
5 at the  hi/lo relay.  when you pull the turn signal  switch  toward you,
resistance should drop from infinite to 0.  OK
