Subject: Disappearing Exhaust Bolts

[This message was posted by a non-subscriber. Please reply to the

I recently replaced my exhaust system with the two-piece after market
kit available from
bus depot. After a month of happy bussing the exhaust started to get
loud again. I looked
underneath the bus, and found that I was missing mucho bolts. Of the six
bolts that
hold the extractor pipe to the heater boxes I had somehow lost four of
them (two on each
side), leaving me one bolt away from disaster on each heater box.

My question is this, Why did I lose the bolts? I tightened them as much
as possible. Did I
tighten them too much? Did heat expansion cause them to pop, or did they
slowly work their
way loose? Maybe I should have checked them after a week or so and
re-tightened them. Has
anyone had a similar experience or any pearls of wisdom to offer?

The exhaust kit did not come with hardware so I was using 5/16&quot; by 1&quot;
bolts from the
hardware store. Is some sort of loc-tite compound required, and what is
the proper
torque for the heater box to extractor pipe bolts?
