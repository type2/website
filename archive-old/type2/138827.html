Many thanks to Richard for popping up to San Francisco with his L-Jet 
tester today.

We confirmed that the injectors were firing correctly.  So, that led us 
to a weak spark.  As I had noted before, I was getting BIG spark from 
the coil TO the distributor cap.  So, Richard and I ran through the 
checklist again, and we discovered that I had simply forgotten to 
install the non-resistor rotor.  &quot;Oops!&quot;  Pulled the old rotor, 
installed the new non-resistor rotor, and the rich running condition 
(actually &quot;incomplete burn due to weak spark condition&quot;) was gone.

I will post photos of the installation once I get my web pages updated.
