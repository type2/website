Hello all, 

I am presently waiting on my engine to get back from the machine shop,
and I am now looking to purchase a replacement clutch assembly, pressure
plate and throwout bearing.

In doing some price checking at some local franchise part stores, I keep
getting asked whether I have a bus made before Feb, 74 or after March 74.
 The Volks catalogs and websites that I'm checking don't mention anything
about a difference between buses made before or after Feb/March.  Has
anyone experienced this before, or are the franchise stores just
confused.

Also, I am having trouble figuring out what month my bus was made.  Does
anyone know where I can find this information, and if it's on the VIN#,
what do I need to look for?

Thanks
Jack
