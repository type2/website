I have to say that Ive never heard of installing the seal first and
then
using the rope technique to put the glass in the seal.
Isnt the seal on the glass outer side much thicker and deeper 
than the inner frame side? 
Im stunned at the notion.


&gt; the trick is to find some nylon rope, just thinner in diameter than the
&gt; thickness of the glass pane...put the rubber seal on the car first....then
&gt; lay the rope in the trough where the glass goes in....now you'll need a
&gt; buddy to help, but, duck tape a broom handle or something to the front of
&gt; the window for a handle, and lay the window over top the rubber seal, but
&gt; roughly in its place....keep the ends of the rope together in your hand...on
&gt; the outside of the glass....then starting at a corner.....push down on the
&gt; glass, while pulling the rope straight back to you....this will peel the
&gt; rubber lip from UNDER the glass, to OVER the glass edge with it sitting in
&gt; place...just make sure you go slow, so you don't tear the rubber....but
&gt; that's how its done...
