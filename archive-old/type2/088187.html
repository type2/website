Hello fellow members
At present my 72 van has no rear lights working.they were working last =
week , at least most of them
but last night i was driving with no rear lights.freaky! the guy who had =
it previously did some wacky wiring,
confusing my mind. somehow he rigged it up so the left signal is up on =
the turn signal and right turn is up again?
kinda wacky.anyway when i looked at the wiring in to the rear lights =
there is some unknown wire.looks like
speaker wire or something. i recieved the site with the electrical =
schematic for my van from thom Fitzpatrick Re: Arlo says.
i couldn't believe i even came across this ...amazed. anyway does anyone =
know what type of electrical wire would be
appropriate? can you get away with using regular wire from an automotive =
store?
please let me know...........i'm in the dark on this one.
Darren
