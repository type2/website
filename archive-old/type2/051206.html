Subject: Re: [T2] Engine compartment

It is of the utmost importance to have the engine compartment sealed!!!!!!!!

You can fab the tin you need if you are handy. I have seen neat work 
made of it. There are kits available. Busdepot_dot_com had imported some 
and may still have it available.

There is also a fiberglass tinware(yeah, I know it is an oxymoron) 
kit available. I saw it installed on a 1976 Westy at Circle Yer 
Wagens. The kit was be made and sold by a shop in Florida. checkout 
www.ivwa_dot_com and look through their sponsor list.

You should also make sure you find a way to support the rear of the 
motor. Even though the 1972 has rear tranny mounts, the weight and 
torque of the motor are more then they were designed to handle.

For a look at the correct tin that was used in Europe in 1972 up 
buses with upright motors check out

&gt;I have a '72 Bus (station wagon), putting a '71 engine in it.  The 
&gt;engine bay is quite a bit bigger than the Type I engine.  What are 
&gt;the suggestions as to how to put tin around the engine and bay area 
&gt;to seal it off, and how important is it to do this.
