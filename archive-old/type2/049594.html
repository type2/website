Subject: RE: [T2] Tires -- Costco, Kirkland 

They are &quot;C&quot; load rating, which is what is specked by VW.  That's 1435 lbs
per tire, which is enough for a vehicle with a GVW of 5,000 lbs.  A &quot;D&quot;
rating is around 1700 lbs per tire, and I'm not sure I know of any proper
fitting tires in the &quot;D&quot; rating, other than the Michelin Agelis 61, which
doesn't seem to be available this side of the Atlantic.

Note also that Truck tires are loaded at 91% of actually carrying load,
whereas car tires are rated at 100% of carrying load.  So a &quot;C&quot; rated truck
tire, actually has 10% reserve, which is about another 140 lbs capacity.
Put another way, a truck tire (ie LT) at 1435 lbs capacity is equivelant to
a car tire at 1575, approx.

Reinforced?  Yes, its a 6 ply.  Passenger car tires are 3 or sometime ply.

Basically the same specs as either:

The Michelin LTX M/S
http://www.michelin_dot_com/us/eng/tire/catalog/ltxms.htm

or the Uniroyal Laredo:

The tread, however, looks more like the LTX M/S tread than the Laredo tread.



Even the beefy Bridgestone Dueler A/T in 195/75R14 is a &quot;C&quot; class tire at
1435 lbs per tire.

Thanks for the feedback.  The tire is made by Uniroyal and, assuming quality
and specs are as represented, it is proper size and load rating for VW vans.

Does it have reinforced sidewalls?
I don't think so.....
Does the max load weight listed on the sidewall meet or exceed 1540 lbs.?
I don't think so.....

Subject: [T2] Tires -- Costco, Kirkland


&gt; I stopped by Costco today.  They sell a 6 ply &quot;c&quot; rated all season
195/75R14
&gt; tire under the name &quot;Kirkland&quot;.  Salesman said they are manufactured at a
&gt; Uniroyal plant (owned by Michelin), and the tire did seem a lot like the
&gt; Uniroyal Laredo.
&gt;
&gt; I compared the tread etc to the Michelin LTX M/S nearby, and it was fairly
&gt; close in style, with a little more siping on the Michelin, and a solid
&gt; centre tread on the &quot;Kirkand&quot;.  About the same tread depth.  Kirkland was
&gt; blackwall both sides, quite plain, which I find attractive in a VW Van
tire.
&gt;
&gt; I've read good things about the Michelin.  I can save $40.00 a tire with
the
&gt; Kirkland.  I'm not much into names and brands.  I'm thinking while the
&gt; Michelin may be marginally better, I'll probably be perfectly happy with
the
&gt; Kirkland.  I will, after all be comparing the Kirkland with the crappy
tires
&gt; I have now, not the Michelin's on the sheft at the tire store.
&gt;
&gt; Anyone have any experience with these?  Recommendations?
&gt;
&gt; Thanks.
