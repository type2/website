Subject: Re: [T2] Weird Engine Sound?

I would agree with Cha and Daniel that it does sound like a lifter ticking.
On the other hand it kind of sounds like maybe an exhaust leak? Does it
sound more like a metalic sound or tat tat tat of the exhaust? Kind of hard
to distinguish in the sound clip.

Subject: [T2] Weird Engine Sound?


&gt; Hi,
&gt;
&gt; I was driving around today in my bus and the engine started making a sound
&gt; that wasn't quite like its normal sound. It has a little clanking or
&gt; tac-tac-tac-tac to it
&gt; that gets me uneasy, therefore I decided to record the sound and ask you
&gt; guys if
&gt; you hear it too, {or if it just me getting paranoid : )}...
