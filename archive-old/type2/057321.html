&gt; Hi,
&gt; 
&gt; I tried to take off the front luggage rack of my '77 Westy. Took out all the
&gt; screws that I could see but I guess it's held on to the roof by more than
&gt; those 4 screws.
&gt; 
&gt; Can someone tell me the correct procedure to remove it (without damaging
&gt; anything).
&gt; 

I'm guessing you've taken out the 4 on the front/sides and still need to
take out the four on the rear side.

To get them out you have to take out the screws that hold on the
headliner and pull it down enough to get your hand in there to get the
bolts off. 8mm, BTW

and watch out for dead mice up there! :-(
