My girlfriend and I just became the proud owners of a '77 Westi.  It is in
great shape with almost all the original parts and only 122,000 miles on it.

The PO replaced the pop top seal last fall but did not do the seal on the
front part (luggage rack).  How is this piece removed?  Also,  what is the
best type of cleaner to use on the fiberglass.

Thanks,

Peter
