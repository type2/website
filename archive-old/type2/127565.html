 replied:
&gt;&gt;To keep from damaging the pushrod tube I put a
 small hose clamp around it and tighten it down, then
grab the clamp with a vice grip&lt;&lt;

Andrew, this worked GREAT!! I put the hose clamps
around the push rod tubes and tightened them down,
then I grabbed the &quot;tail&quot; of the hose clamp strap with
the vice grip and was able to get enough leverage to
pull that dog right out!! Thanks for the help!!
