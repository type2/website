And once you complete the battery tray repair, spend a few dollars on a
plastic battery box.  You don't even have to bother with fitting the lid,
but your battery tray corrosion problem will be solved.

FWIW.....

&gt;&gt;  Replacing that right battery tray 'the right way' is a bear, i know -
but with the inspired use of some alternate materials - wood, plastic,
fiberglass, foam, tape - whatever - - maybe you can seal it up *and* provide
a surface that will if not absorb the corrosive leakage of the battery at
least repel it - they do make those 'battery pads' that are supposed to suck
it all up.  &lt;&lt;
