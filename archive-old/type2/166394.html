Hello all,

the common consensus seems to NEVER EVER use reworked used heads on your
engine. So what would you do:

(1) Spend a lot of money for the heads featured here
(http://www.aircooledtechnology_dot_com/store/product.php?productid=16729&amp;ca
t=283&amp;page=1)? Is this price for two of them or just one I wonder...

(2) Buy AMC heads (anyone knows where to get them in Germany?)?
Apparently these should be reconfigured with guides, seats, springs,
valves. Is there a company (doesn't have to be in Germany) selling them
already assembled this way?

(3) Buy NOS (never installed) heads from a german supplier that come
without valves and springs. I remember I've read about the AMC heads
being superior casted. Will this make any difference to NOS ones?

Some asked about the head temps:
I have a VDO CHT gauge installed, but I did not dare posting this on the
list since they seem to be considered crap anyway. But according to the
VDO gauge the engine was running cool and it felt cool to the touch as
well... (I will buy a dakota digital CHT gauge as soon as I have some
spare money, I promise!)

I took a look at the damaged head yesterday and apart from the dropped
seat, it still looked brand new. No residue or whatsoever in the
combustion chamber or on the valves, mating surface to cylinder is
perfectly planar and no cracks between spark plug hole or seats. What a
shame...

Thanks in advance!

Cheers,

Timo
