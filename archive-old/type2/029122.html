Greetings all, what are the consequeces of using an ECU from a bus with
standard transmission on a bus with automatic transmission?  Will an ECU
from a 76 FI bus work with the rest of FI components from a 78 FI bus?  I
hope all of those heading to everybus have a great time this weekend.  Maybe
next year my currnet project will be up for the journey.  Rattle&amp;Hum, Marcus
