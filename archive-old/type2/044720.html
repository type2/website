Subject: [T2] Is it worth it?

Let me start by saying I have owned an loved VW's for the 15 years I have 
been driving.  A few years ago I paid $2000 for a 1973 Camper in fair 
condition, drove it about 400 miles, towed it about 200 miles, and spent 
about $500 more before letting the city tow it away.  As I look through the 
classifieds I see buses that trade hands every year, even ads for the early 
90's vanagons often say something like &quot;100,000 miles, but only 30,000 on 
new engine&quot;.  Is there something inherently wrong with these things?  Why do 
I want another?  If I buy one will I have to put a new engine in every year 
and stop every 200 miles for n &quot;adjustment&quot;?
