X-Diagnostic: MESSAGE REQUIRES APPROVAL - A

Trying to keep my 71 as stock as possible, and since I am running the new
Michelin Agilis 185-R 14 C Tires. Thinking of replacing the existing KYB gas
adjust shocks with new Boge +ACo-OEM+ACo-Automatic shocks in hopes of getting a
little smoother less stiff ride for the highway.  What do you all think?
