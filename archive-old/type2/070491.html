Subject: Vanagon tie rod boots

I have a torn boot on what I assume is the tie rod but I am unfamiliar with
the steering and suspension pieces. If that's what it is, how important is it
to replace and is it a simple job? I seem to recall mechanics grimacing when
front end work on a vanagon comes up. Should both be done at the same time
while I'm at it?

Thanks,

Weston
