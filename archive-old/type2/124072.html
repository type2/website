Subject: RE: [T2] will this motor work???

The case will be dipstickless unless you drill it, which is best done to
an unassembled case.
The t3 filler will need to be blocked, or you will have to figure out
how to use it for a dipstick.
All tin should be changed to upright, unless you plan on hanging the t3
motor in there, which like means body cutting.
The mustashe bar will be angry and lonely, as the t3 fan lives there.
So, the weird oil pump cover mustashe holder would have to be used,
assumign you do a tin changeover.
The oil pressure sender is on the oil cooler, something else to change
or switch to upright and plug.
The fuel injection, if any likely has to go for the upright tin.
The exhuast might work, but I doubt the muffler would clear mustashe bar
or valance.
There might be more, but essentially if you can overcome dipstick,
replace all tin and fix cooler config to upright t1/t2, and change
accessories, intake, and exhuast, it's doable. Under all that stuff is
an almost t1 engine...
I have not seen this done. Depending on the year of t3 engine, you need
to make sure the clutch PP is hapyp with the throwout style and starter.
Good luck,
Al
