do you have drive in reverse..???

possible problems check

.  wrong ATF are you using DEXTRON
.  oil pump loose??
.  valve body dirty
.  piston ring on ATF pump neck broken
.  D+R clutch servo piston seals leaking
.  D+R clutch, bushing worn


pray it is the wrong ATF
does the ATF smell burnt.
does it feel like anything is slipping

does it just &quot;not shift into 3rd&quot;??? or does it try but won't go??

if it goes in Reverse but not 3rd maybe the linkage has slipped a little.


good luck
Bob
