&gt;Notice anything? Like the WRONG PART NUMBER? Grrr... The housing was

The sticker looks like SR15N, which should (theoretically) be &quot;correct&quot; for your 
Bus.  I don't think the problem you had was &quot;wrong starter&quot;, I think it was just 
&quot;bad starter&quot;.  The fact that it went bad and looks as new as it does may say
something about the quality, but since I don't have any experinece with the 15N
I can't really comment.

.. I thought *I* had a wiring disaster hiding under the dash.  Good greif...
