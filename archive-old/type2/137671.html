Subject: Re: [T2] 68 disk brake conversion/ powertrain upgrade Q's

What's wrong with using the 72 &amp; up engine support? One issue we are
having with my 72 is that a T1 engine lived in it for a while, and
when converting back to T4, the apparently shorter tranny input shaft
ate my pilot bearing. I also had trouble with the starter and had to
switch to an AT starter.

 As I understand it a T4
 won't fit with my &quot;68 only&quot; engine support without structural mods.
 Fact or Myth? Anyone familiar with this issue?
