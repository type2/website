Hey List (and Dave, Yes I remember...Hope all is well...)

Thanks for your replies, I went the Loctite route and torqued those puppies
down as much as I could without flinging the thing across the room.

Thanks for all the reassurance about the oil leaks..I feel *much* better now
&gt;:P
Thankfully the eeby geebies have gone into temporary remission.

I went with Permatex 3H for the case seal and the main bearing studs...
...and of course there was the silent prayer..

I'll be sure to keep you updated.
