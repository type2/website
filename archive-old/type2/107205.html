Subject: Very Green Thanks !

	I wanted to thank everyone for their input and even showing me a
picture of what I needed to find. It was very simple to do (next time I
get a gun to make a little less mess).

	Now onto my next question. I have a distributor with a vacuum
advance and I think the vacuum is going. I talked to a couple of &quot;old
timers&quot; who told me to try to find another distributor with vacuum
advance and to stay away from the Bosch 009 version as I have dual
carbs. Is there a place where I can order one as my local parts store
doesn't carry anything (VW Related) besides the Bosch version (which
they have to order)?

	My last question is hopefully a simple one too. I have looked at
Bus Boys, Bus Depot, and a few others VW related sights and I can't seem
to find a alternator with a higher output, seems like everyone just has
a stock replacement. I want to install a relay on the battery so my bus
and I could use a little electric while camping and know that both
batteries are getting a good charge while the engine is running.

	I look forward to any and all suggestion from all the VW Guru's
!
