&gt;Richard, with your confirmation of my observation, I will bring the idle 
&gt;back up from the 750 observed after retard added, to the 950 previous seen 
&gt;with just advance. 

Even the buses with 5 or 10 ATDC timing have their idle speed compensated for with an idle that is around 900 rpm.

&gt;Also, I bought a #4 Sears Craftsman hex shaft phillips screwdriver 

Should still fit although the phillips screws on the tin take a #3.

&gt;Man, it is so 
&gt;NICE to hear the 'crack' when those fillister screws give up their grip!!

It sure does. Pity that some go easily and some won't give up the fight. The screws on the tin I'll be pulling on this weekend are going to get a whack form the impact driver first just for insurance.
