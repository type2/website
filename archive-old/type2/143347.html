Subject: Re: [T2] Newbie hitting walls...

&gt; Absolutely.  That's why I pointed it out.  I took a look through the
&gt; post on the Samba and didn't notice anywhere that hydraulic valves
&gt; were confirmed, just that they were assumed because it appears to be a
&gt; stock 78.
&gt;


If he had solid lifters and tightened his valves 1 1/2 turns after contact,
I seriously doubt he'd get those compression numbers.

Yes, it's an assumption. But a pretty safe assumption.
