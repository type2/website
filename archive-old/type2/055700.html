Subject: Round Mirror I.D. Needed
Content-Disposition: inline

So,

I found this '64 Single Cab in my driveway the other morning, and it had a smaller than usual round mirror on the drivers side.  The ball mount on the back of the mirror was off center.  Stamped on the back was &quot;Pat Pending&quot; (with some numbers that had been worn off with age), and &quot;A.W. Rosen &amp; Co.&quot;  

This doesn't sound like a VW mirror, but what do I know.  Anyone know anything about these?

Robert
