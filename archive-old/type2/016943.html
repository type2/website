&gt; That question about the homemade air cleaner reminded me of a project on my
&gt; backburner:  I'd like to convert the oil bath air cleaner on my 71 Westy to
&gt; use a paper filter.  I figure I can find a cylinder filter that I can fit
&gt; inside the can, with no outside changes.  I'd like to keep the outside of
&gt; the filter assembly stock, but never have to mess with the oil again.  Does
&gt; anyone know of an off the shelf filter that will work?  Or any reason why I
&gt; shouldn't?  Thanks much.

&gt; Nice to have the list back, eh?

If that's really important to you, (and others),do you realize that VW
made that exact thing and put it on 73-79 busses with 1600 motors for
ROW (rest of world)? I'll bet Ron at Bus Depot or someone in Europe
could find some. It looks just like a 75-79 2.0 liter rear section and
element, but a front section that hooks to the snorkel hose that's used
on a 68-71. It has all the vacuum hookups, thermostat and it's made to
work with your motor. You'd probably have to cut the bracket from a
later bus and weld it on, though VW does show the bracket in the book,
too.
