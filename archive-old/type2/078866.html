Subject: Re: [T2] not dots on crankshaft??


Indeed, install the crank gear, then set #1 piston at TDC by feeling with a
screwdriver through the plug hole. Now you have the search location for
those dots pegged making them quite a bit easier to find. Paint the three
or four teeth in the vicinity. Let it dry. Then use some 220 grit to remove
the paint, leaving a bit of paint in the depressions marking the gear
teeth. I always keep a little vial of white/yellow/red finger nail enamel
for marking timing marks of all types. White shows up best under a timing
light. I also put a dab of paint at 180=B0 on the crank pully for a referenc=
