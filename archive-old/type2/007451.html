List,
In a moment of blaring idiocy, i took my wiper motor apart (75 camper).  Man.  Does anyone know how to get those three magnet/brush daddies to stay the hell up in their little slots so's i can get the shaft back in without involving another person? **looks around sheepishly**
Also, FYI, if you take your wiper motor off the assy., make sure you've got it lined up right when it goes back on - my wipers come to a rest in the middle of the windshield because i overlooked this concept.
pushing the envelope,
c.gordon
