Subject: &lt;F&gt; Bus sighting

Mike Apsey sent this to me the other day and asked that I forward it on Friday:
http://www.atomfilms_dot_com/spotlights/journey/crew.asp

The picture shows a European Westy with the extended front bumper and
spare tire box (Marcus told me about these at last year's Everybus). The
video doesn't show very much bus, so don't worry about not being able to
play it.
