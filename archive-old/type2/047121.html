Volks,

I just re-read what I posted and I do *not* mean to imply anything in the
use of &quot;bad apples&quot; with regard to any of our commercial vendors,
especially not Ron.  In so far as I know, all of the commercial vendors
who appear on the list are reputable people who I would be happy to deal
with.

I was thinking about some of the complaints I have heard over time from
some list members buying from and selling to other list members.  This
concerns me far more than the commercial vendors, tho I worry about them
too.  If you agree to buy a part, and get the part, and don't send the
check, that defeats the whole purpose of the list!  Please, please, PLEASE
fulfil you bargains!!!

                           H Steven Dolan
