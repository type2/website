Subject: Re: engine from 79 into 73?

Hi Volks,

I put a 73 engine into my 79 bus and it fit just fine. Actually, it was
Denmeister who did the work, but he didn't have any problems. (At least none
that he mentioned).  The 73 tin fits the 79 compartment perfectly. I got the
79 with no motor or transmission, and he transplanted them both from my
rusty 73 westy. Is the 79 tranny different from the 73?

You need to jury rig a mount for the air cleaner, but the motor mounts
shouldn't be a problem. He cut mine off with a hacksaw, and saved it for
future project similar to the one in question.

That's just my $.02, YMMV.

&gt;&gt; Can i take a 2000cc from a 79 and put it in a 73?
&gt; 
&gt; Yes, you will need to change the engine mounts though as they are different.
&gt; Make sure all the ancilliaries and tinware come with the donor engine.
