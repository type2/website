Subject: Re: GL5-MT1 (was) where to find GL4 80W90 gear oil

IMHO, the 'definitive' answer lies in the specs.  IF GL5-MT1 meets the 
specs of VW 501.50, then you're good to go. If it doesn't....  However I 
do have an anecdotal experience. Totally un-bus related.  For a while I 
was using my brother's Suzuki Swift to commute 200 miles daily to 
school.  It had a halfshaft seal that was leaking and I usually kept on 
top of it. One day, it started feeling notchy in the shifting department 
on the far end of my commute.  I pulled into a Quik-lube and asked them 
to fill the gearbox up.  The 'grease-monkey' refused, saying that they 
didn't have the correct oil.  Yup, Suzuki specs GL4 too.  IMHO, if they 
were interchangable, this little incident would not have happened....

Ya pays yer money and takes yer choice.

&gt; I did read the archives and came the conclusion that the GL5-MT1 has 
&gt; been reformulated and is acceptable for manual VW gearbox.
&gt; I got the impression that the GL5 warnings were now unfounded.
