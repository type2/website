&gt;         Quick and hopefully easy question here.  In the process of my
&gt; engine rebuild, and we're replacing the bearings on the crankshaft, and we
&gt; came across this sentence in the book we are referencing:
&gt; 
&gt; &quot;An important part of VW connecting rod service is replacing the rod nuts.
&gt; _Always use new rod nuts_ for maximum strength and accurate torque
&gt; readings.&quot;

My 2 cents on the 4 dollar rod nut thing:  When I rebuilt my bus motor, I
didn't know you were supposed to replace the rod nuts so I didn't.  That was
8 years and 80k miles ago.  When I rebuilt my 914 motor, I didn't replace
the rod nuts.  That was 5 years and 40k miles ago.  So I don't believe it is
a make-it or break-it kind of thing, but hey, for the $4 or $5 the stupid
things cost, why not?
