&gt; Here in Orygun we don't really get that much cold weather.  But the average
&gt; temps have been 14 degrees in the morning.  Topping out at about 33 degrees
&gt; for the past week.  As some of you may not know, I parked my bus about a month
&gt; ago in favor for a Thing.  (forgive me Albert for I have sinned).  The Thing
&gt; fired right up this morning as always.  I looked at the bus, hmmmmm.   While
&gt; the Thing was warming up I gave the bus a try.  Vrrrrooooommmm!  The only I
&gt; really do for my Volkies is keep them tuned and I run 30 wt. oil in the
&gt; winter.  The only trouble I've had so far during this cold spell is 90 wt in
&gt; the transaxle seems a little stiff.  So I've taken to backing in the front
&gt; yard so I just split in the morning.
Mr.BH:
It was WAAY below zero this morning, or so I'm told (I'm a 2nd shifter)
in Iowa, and 90 weight is a problem here even more. The nice fix for
that  is synthetic. Local FLAPS has some name brand for 6.00 per bottle,
(quart I think). Seems it took 3 bottles last time I filled one. Sure is
nice to have the trans work right away, instead of 4 miles after you
start.
If it gets much colder around here I'm going to have to find a coat. I
confess, I'm spending most of my time driving the 82 diesel Vanagone
which I replaced the heater core in last year. I've never had a heater
put out better heat! Diesel Vanagons had water heater cores in front and
optional BA6 Eberspachers underneath that burned diesel fuel. Mine
works,  not quite right, but after the new core, I don't even care that
much!
