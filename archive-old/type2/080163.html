&gt; I was reading the instructions that came with my new rings, and it says
&gt;  to remove the ridge in the cylinder at the top of the ring travel or
&gt;  risk messing up the new rings.  How do I do this?
&gt;  
&gt;  I just ordered a craftsman honing tool to break the glaze on the
&gt;  cylinders.  Will this be sufficient to drop that ridge down?

Mike,

the hone will not remove the ridge; there is a tool made to do this. It is 
called a cylinder ridge reamer. You turn it in the cylinder with a wrench. 
Sears used to sell them and I expect still does.
