Subject: Re: [T2] 2.0 FI timing way out?

Assuming your plug wires are installed correctly, the distributor can be
&quot;off&quot; by 1 tooth, 2 teeth, or more.  It's not the distributor per se that's
&quot;off&quot;, it's really the distributor drive gear down in the engine.

Bring the #1 cylinder to TDC on the compression stroke.  Then look at the
rotor on the distributor and see if it's pointing at the &quot;notch&quot; in the rim
of the distributor.  If it's not, rotate the distributor until it is;
that'll be close enough until you can time it correctly with a timing light.
If you can't get the rotor pointing at the notch be cause you don't have
enough &quot;swing&quot; in the distributor, i.e., you can't rotate the distributor
enough, then you'll have to reset the distributor drive gear.

Subject: [T2] 2.0 FI timing way out?


&gt; Hi list, just tried to get my just finished rebuilt 2.0 started.  It
&gt; sputtered and back fired and would only run with me holding the throttle
&gt; wide open.
&gt; Assuming this is a timing issue, can the distributor be off by a tooth
&gt; and produce this effect?  I thought it was either correct or 180 off.
&gt; Would it run at all if it were 180 off?
