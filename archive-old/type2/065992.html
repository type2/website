Subject: 76 Shifting problems

Hi Volks,

Last night something wierd happened.  I was letting my friend drive my van ( with me 
in it of course )  and when he shifted to third, we couldn't find it!!  It was like it was 
blocked off or something. I thought maybe it was just him not used to the van ( I don't 
usually let people drive it) and I hopped back into the drivers seat.  Same thing :(  I 
didn't have far to go so I nursed it home in second gear.  I got out and fiddled with it a 
bit and I did get third to engage only twice out of about 20 attempts.

   So everyone, what should I check?  I am not all that familiar with the specific 
workings of a transmission and it's associated pieces but I get the general picture.  I was 
hoping it might be something up front like my clutch free-play ( which I have been 
meaning to adjust anyway ) or something in the shift linkage.    All the other gears are 
the same as usual except reverse is getting harder to locate as time passes. 

I guess what I'm looking for is to hear that I don't need a new tranny, or that the 
syncros are toast or some other nasty ( and $$ expensive ) thing has gone wrong.  I'll 
deal with the news as I get it I guess.  Thanks everyone .
