Subject: re getting engine out via winch from above:

Re Scot Trepod's method ove using winch over engine access hatch:
Nifty idea for getting engine out- but for reinserting, to align the
transhaft horizontally must be fun if you have to be winching AND
eyeballing at the same time!  When alone, I have a sledge with me and
lie under the bus and beat on the jack (or board if using 2 scissor
jacks on a board resting on broomstick rollers)- the latter is quite
stable and easier to adjust, but harder to get under the engine.  When
they bolted up the rear of the trans, they took away the ability to get
the trans/engine parallel to the ground if the rear of the bus is raised
up- very easy with a 71 or earlier, and made getting at the upper mounts
much easier with no access hatch.  Now I drive the bus up onto ramped
4x4's in back (or you can jack it up onto 4&quot; thick capping blocks)  and
jack the front to get bus parallel to floor and jack.
