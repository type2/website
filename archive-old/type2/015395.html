&gt;Anybody know any tricks got get this thing off, or do I need to just brute
&gt;strength it?
&gt;

Just did this last week. I have a cotter key removing tool. Looks like a
screwdriver, but the last inch is bent 90° and is tapered. You work the
point under the hose then push and pull it around the perimeter to break
loose the bond. I have a pick tool of similar configuration that I use for
smaller hoses in the same manner.
