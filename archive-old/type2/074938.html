Subject: Re: &lt;FMBC&gt; FullMoon bus toy 

I know we don't have a quote yet, but I am sure the more colors and the more
intricate the artwork the more expensive the price will be. Especially if we
have lots of different pics all over the bus. I think simple is better. A
good logo and &quot;Full Moon Bus Club&quot; is the way to go. I think it would look
tacky with a bunch of stuff on it. Maybe a fire and a nice full moon on one
side and the logo on the other.

I emailed a friend who has designed some bus t-shirts, etc. I am waiting to
hear back from her, but she does window fronts for a living and has make
some pretty cool shirts.
