  I'm curious - what were the circumstances
&gt; leading to your fire?   I can describe/detail the wiring on mine if
you try
&gt; to piece together if that would help.
&gt; 
&gt; Regards

dale-
(and anyone else wanting to know)
   out here in eastern oregon, we have a lot of grass fields. not
normal grass fields, mind you, but the kind with old cars, grease
barrels, really high dry grass, burn barrels, and anything else
flammable. all these items are stored safely in the confines of a fire
marshall approved barb-wire fence. basically, just alot of
pyrotechnics shows. the hollywood type.
needless to say, the hind end of my bus was the featured special
effect in one of these field fire/pyrotechnics shows. 
the fire was put out by above said fire marshall and his crew, but not
before they watched the carbeurator shoot 15 foot flames in their
general direction. they then waited until said carbeurator (and the
distributor, every piece of rubber,all the plastic, and anything made
of pot metal) was sufficiently MELTED when turned their hoses on
it.(they have since informed the farmer that his barb-wire is not up
to fire code).
my engine compartment is somewhere between deep-fried and well done.
SO- dale and all you others on the list, this is why i need a wiring
harness for my '72 micro. not just a few wires, but everything in the
harness.
(and a new carb. any suggestions?)
(BTW- the ONLY thing that burned was the engine compartment. amazing,
huh? Divine VW intervention?!?!)
