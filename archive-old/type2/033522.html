Bob,
   Sorry,  no to both questions, no relation. And no keyboard allthough I 
wish I had a simplified keyboard as I can barely operate this one. My wife 
hates to watch me type she says it's &quot;too painful to watch&quot;. Sorry to 
everyone about the smarta--ed comment the other day it just seemed the thing 
to do. That is if that sort of thing bothers you. 
Happy bussing.
