Subject: 82 vanagon Westy...factory specs

Hi....
Failed the CA smog test due to timing as a result of excessive RPMs at  idle. 
  I think there is a vacuuam leak causing idle to go to  1040.  What is the 
factory spec idle and what are the timing numbers  ie.  dwell etc.  All the 
readings for the emissions checked  out ok but the hci was .1 from failing....
