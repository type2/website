Subject: Re: [T2] AVP longblock Rebuild: Head failure_at_ 15K Miles

Hey Robert S. Williams, MD:

AVP has been around for quite awhile and has, as far as I know, an
unblemished reputation for being very good rebuilders and *extremely*
responsive to any problems.  So:

Thoughts: Sounds like you have a problem with this engine.
Comments: It sounds like a bad valve.
Advice: Call AVP and ask for help.  I'll bet you get some.

Subject: [T2] AVP longblock Rebuild: Head failure_at_ 15K Miles


&gt; I own a 1982 Aircooled Vanagon. In late 1999 I had a AVP Rebuilt Longblock
&gt; installed. Since that time, I have only put 15,000 careful miles on the
&gt; Westie.
&gt;
&gt;[large snip detailing problems with one head]
&gt;
&gt; Now, I know that AVP only gives 12 MOnth / 12,000 Mile warranty ... but it
&gt; seems somewhat &quot;GEXish&quot; to have an engine failure at 15,000 miles  on a
&gt; fresh rebuild.
&gt;
&gt; Thoughts? Comments? Advice?
