Subject: 1700cc head &quot;Fly-cutting&quot; question. Help needed.

Hello List,

I am trying to do valve work on my 1700cc engine
myself. So far I can tell that the valve seats are
good. The valve guides need to be replaced. I have
access to the equipment to do the valves. I need to
send off the heads to have the valve guides pressed
out and new ones pressed back in. I made the mistake
of bead blasting the sealing surfaces when I was bead
blasting the head. What should I do? Some one told me
that they need to be &quot;fly-cut&quot; Is this correct? The
heads also showed signs of exhaust leaks where the
head met the cyllinders. Would flycutting also fix
this problem? Any one have experience with Rimco with
this matter? I want to know exactally what I need to
have done when I ship them to Rimco. Any help would be
appreciated. Other than possible &quot;fly cutting&quot; them I
was planning on doing a valve job, replacing the
exhaust valves with sodium exhaust valves, replacing
the valve guides, and sand blasting the heads. Is
there any thing I am missing???

Thanks!

David Kelly
