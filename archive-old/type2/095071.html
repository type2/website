Billy

Thanks for pointing the 79 wire color info, I had not noticed that.

I said:
 &gt;1. My comments on wire colors are from a color schematic for 77 and &gt;78 
models. My 79 model schematic does not show wire colors.

You said:
&gt;they are typed in the wire. (at least in my bentley ie: bk/wh)

BTW, disconnecting components one by one(including the coil) while watching 
the coil voltage might be interesting.

1. Fresh air fan.

2. coil.

3 Back up light (fuse S21).

4. Fuse S12.

5. Fuse S11.

6. Warning buzzer (or whatever some PO has hooked to the buzzer wire).

7. Double relay.

Chuck
