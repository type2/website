Check your wiring and grounds.  May be time to replace your fuel pump.  I've
found a Subaru fuel pump (for carbed engines) to work well with a carbed engine.
I set a pressure regulator to 3.0 PSI and connect the hot lead to a standard
relay switched by the + side of the coil.  The beauty of this pump is it came
with a shock mounting bracket.
