Subject: Re: [T2] High Idle after removing EGR..WHY?

Ryan:

If *all* you did was remove the EGR and then replace it with a block off
plate, and now you have high idle, then I'd guess you haven't really blocked
off the hole in the air distribution box where the EGR used to sit.  Air
leak = high idle.  Or, maybe you knocked off a nearby hose, like the one of
the hoses that attaches to the fuel pressure regulator or decel valve?

I think the biggest issue with running a high idle due to a leak somewhere
is that you're &quot;leaning out&quot; the fuel mixture, which can be a problem.

Subject: [T2] High Idle after removing EGR..WHY?


&gt; Yesterday I removed the EGR valve and successfully placed a block off
plate
&gt; over the remaining hole. Today, when I started HER up.. I noticed the idle
was
&gt; really high (1200). I could close the idle screw completely and it still
&gt; wouldn't lower it enough. Does anybody know why this is?...And is there
&gt; anything I can do about it? Plus, the idle oscillates about 200 rpm
between
&gt; high and low. I'm surprised by the affects of removing the EGR system.
Note:
&gt; It's a 1980 FI that never had a crossbar exhaust set up and my EGR filter
was
&gt; holey and the adjusting rod was defective. Reason for removing my EGR
system.
&gt; I can't tell if I have a vacuum leak somewhere by the throttle body or if
it's
&gt; just the sound of air flowing through it. I disconnected the lines and
made
&gt; changes to the hose connections by cutting off the tips and re-inserting
them
&gt; back. Still have the same noises. I know for a fact that my block off
plate is
&gt; sealed shut. Please help...I have a Widespread Panic show to get to
tomorrow
&gt; night.
&gt; What are the problems of running idle at 1200 range?
