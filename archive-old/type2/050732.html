I was lucky enough to have a mechanic included in the purchase of my car,
but our bus has been taken to Griffin Autowerke in Berkeley and I think they
are pretty good, kinda on the pricey side though.

I am a new owner of a 1971 Bus (and new to the list).  Could I get
recommendations for good VW mechanics in the Berkeley, California area?

Thanks,

Lloyd
