&gt;  I do know that

So I wrote:

OK, I've gotta jump in here. First the usual disclaimers: smog laws may be
ineffective in many cases as currently implemented, God knows they could be 
better, we all like our buses and clean air too, we all fancy ourselves as
reasonable people, we all want a convenient solution, I like you all, I don't 
have all the answers either, this isn't a flame, I'm enjoying this thread...

&gt; I do know that harm is harm

Granted. 

&gt; and if it isn't demonstrable it isn't real.

Hold on there! &quot;Demonstrable&quot; means person x can marshal enough evidence to
convince person y that something is real? Who is person y? You? Me? The review 
panel of the scientific journal you're trying to publish your findings in? 
Corporation y's highly paid and very aggressive legal staff?  The jury that they
are using every trick in the book to sway? The congressional panel convened 
by the recipients of corporation y's campaign contributions? 51% of the American
people who bother to vote and can be bamboozled into an opinion by a well 
financed and very slick ad campaign?                                

The tobacco industry STILL stands up in front of God and everybody, looks us 
straight in the eye, and claims no one can demonstrate that nicotine is
addictive or that smoking tobacco has ANY adverse health effects AT ALL. 
How many reasonable people who've seen the evidence really  believe that at 
least some of the alleged health hazards of cigarettes are not &quot;real?&quot;

&gt;  If I can
&gt;  demonstrate that actual identifiable people are being harmed as of now by
&gt;  capricious emissions laws, can you demonstrate that an identifiable person
&gt;  *will* be harmed if those laws were repealed?

Our world is filled with examples of well documented environmental problems that
people with vested interests still claim are &quot;undemonstrable.&quot; Acid rain? Ozone 
hole? How bad Chernobyl continues to be? How endangered (insert your favorite 
species here) really is? 

To cite just one example, Methyl dibromide is STILL legal to use as
a soil fumigant in the US despite lots of terrifically persuasive scientific 
evidence that it is a terrible contributor to global ozone depletion (not to 
mention its extreme toxicity for ag workers). This is because the strawberry 
industry is a powerful political constituency that finds it easy to estimate 
exactly how much money strawberry growers a, b, and c will lose if it is banned.
Meanwhile global atmospheric scientists find 
it impossible to demonstrate how much the myriad effects of ozone depletion 
caused by that particular chemical will cost identifiable individuals. Human 
costs of ozone depletion are just as real as some farmer's bank account, 
it's just harder to figure out global biogeochemical processes and cancer 
causality than it is to balance your checkbook. Duh.

My point is that this is a very common theme in environmental  risk assessment. 
The processes of environmental damage are complex, and the effects are diffuse. 
Diffuse effects can  be very real and can be modelled in a statistical sense 
that is very real. For processes we understand well, we can often estimate the 
numbers of people who are affected and maybe even their approximate geographic 
location, but we usually can't produce a list of names. We can estimate the 
overall costs too, but without a list of names we can't figure out exactly who 
is paying. Not because the damage and the costs aren't real, but because the 
system is so big and complicated we can't figure out who to send the claims to.
But proponents of environmentally damaging activities are generally identifiable
by name. They are often quick to estimate exactly what it costs them to be 
denied and just as quick to demand compensation for their losses. I assert that
ease of accounting does not really make the cost of our smog tests more &quot;real&quot; 
than the fact that some people are killed by air pollution. The health effects 
of air pollution are very real to those who are harmed by it and those gases 
definitely came out of somebody's tailpipe. But the gases are invisible, 
anonymous, and they are all mixed up with everyone else's gases so everyone can hide behind the problem of &quot;demonstrability&quot; and pretend it's not their problem.

Odds are, it will be Rosa the janitor's grandma who dies because she'll be the 
one living without good health care in the smoggiest part of town, but I'd be 
hard pressed to justify taking away Rosa's gross polluter car because it's the 
only one she can afford..

PS- Of course, lots of fuzzyheaded CRAP can't be clearly demonstrated or 
disproved either and the trick is to know the difference. If these problems were
easy and tractable, we'd be living in a whole different world.
I really appreciated Bob Hoover's comments about expectations of cost, 
performance, and convenience for potential solutions to the one billion 
automobiles blues. He cut right to the heart of the matter.

PPS- Um, guess I'd better offer some VW content? This is all about the moral and
epistomological underpinnings of VW smog standards, right? Right!
