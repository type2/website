Alright
Found out that it is easiest if not the only way to leave the tin on the
motor and pull it all together.
    Now the question for tomorrow???!!!  Got the engine all lose and pulled
out to where the long 3 inch (estimate) bottom engine bolts are free.(Had to
remove the coil to get it that far)  Got the wires all disconnected and on
the other side of the tin.  Now it seems that the tranny shaft is about 2
inches too long as I can get my hand up in side next to the pressure plate
and feel the shaft going still into the hole for longer than I can feel.  It
almost seems like the shaft is coming out of the tranny with the motor.  I
am pulling the motor because of a very noisy tranny for replacement.  Can't
the shaft come loose on the inside of the tranny and pull out with the
motor.  I am cleaned up and the motor is sitting on the floor jack still up
there on the shaft.  Any hints for tomorrow other than slam it back in and
tow it to Millard Motors.  I love to work on my car when things go good but
I hate it when nothing goes right.
Time to kick the cat
AHHHHHHHHHH  that's better
