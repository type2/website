Subject: [T2] Nasty Judder

Dear All

My 73 Bus has started making a nasty judder when braking and cornering at
the same time. This is also accompanied by a kind of knocking noise (not a
cv joint kind of knock but more of a grinding knock) The brakes fine the
rest of the time. I have also noticed a slight vibration through the
steering wheel. Any ideas?
