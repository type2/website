Subject: Distributor Problems?

I have just spent the better part of today trying to get my 78 bus to
crank.  there are several issues that i have but the biggest problem i have
is the distributor.   i have placed cylinder one  at  &quot;top dead center&quot;   as
i mean the  cylinder  is at the top of the compression stroke at clinder
one.   i have the distributor in place and the points gapped correctly and
allof my wires are connected and they are connected to the correct spark
plug.  when i out the rotor button on, it should line up with the notch, but
it doesnt.   it  is 90 degrees away, what should i do?  i have provided a
link to the pictures if my problem.  please help me brng this old girl back
to life.
