I'm can't seem to remove the BN4 gas heater from the back of my 71 Westy. 
Just got it resurrected today, but I had to gerry rig the wiring, and plus 
the heater is leaking. Anyone know of any tricks for removing this heater? I 
hope I don't have to remove the engine, as my odds of doing so are slim - 
just got my first socket set a month ago. Specifically, I can't seem to undo 
the front of the heater from where it attaches to the firewall. Thanks for 
the help.

Sean
71 Westy
