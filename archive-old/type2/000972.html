Subject: Engine size in a splittie......

    I am going to be putting in a new engine in my '66 Splittie and was
curious what is the biggest engine I can fit in the back of that thing
without any huge modifications. I am really wanting a 1776 dual carb set up
so I don't lose to much of the reliability factor but am looking for any
suggestions I could get. If anyone has other ideas for me feel free to throw
them my way I could use them.
