Yep, thanks.  I did check that ground a few months back.

Right now I have mucho problems, the least of which is a burnt starter 
motor.


Burnt - meaning I took it out and apart and it looks like a melted candle 
inside, and smells/stinks like burned insulation.

I melted my GROUND cable (not a web cable, but a mini version of the power 
cable) too, and I melted or blew up the power strap connector (lead??) to 
the battery, and last night, with a patched together starter (part from a 
'72, and part from a previously died starter - so far I have run through 4 
starters) things went BLACK.

Black = 1 AM Easter morning, with everything back in the '78, I turn the key 
to the basic RUN position.  All my dash lights come on, my dome light is on 
and my open door buzzer is buzzing.

Then I turn the key to START position, and instantly everything goes BLACK.  
Like, no warning or noise.  Like a fuse in the house went out, instantly.

Horrors, I am afraid to go out an look at what happened.

So I am asking the boys on the net for a local (Northern Virginia or 
Southern Maryland) starter.

I thing I will not be so lucky.

Happy Easter.  At least one guy made it to the resurrection.

Oh, yes, my Easter thought.

Seven years ago, on Easter Thursday, my son, ten at the time, said this 
small grace at dinner - - -

     &quot;Jesus, tomorrow you are going to die, and on Sunday you will be born 
again.  Good luck to you.&quot;

Hey, I need someone out there to wish ME some good luck.
