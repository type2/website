&gt; - last time it run was 3 years ago

&gt; - clutch pedal is very difficult to move, I would say jammed. The clutch lever
&gt; on the tranny seems to move a little bit.
&gt; - I can not turn the pulley by hand
&gt; 
&gt; Some of the things I am going to try in the next couple of days are:
&gt; - check tranny fluid
&gt; - put some oil in the cylinders
&gt; - spray all clutch linkages with oil
&gt; - try to take the rear wheels off, I will have to find a 46 mm socket and
&gt; breaker bar.
&gt; 
&gt; Any other things I can try?

my suspicion would be that in the 3 years it sat, the rear wheel hubs
rusted to the brake and &quot;froze&quot;   and it sounds like the clutch is not
releasing so you have no idea if it is in gear or not....first thing I
would do would be to get the clutch working and then make sure it is in
neutral.  also some minor part of the engine might be hanging up, check it
thourghly.
