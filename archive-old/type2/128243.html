Subject: Re: [T2] Click &amp; Clack...two guys, one brain 

&gt;   In my Sunday paper, Frick &amp; Frack were busy convincing a
&gt;   woman that if her daughter bought a 1970 VW bus, she would
&gt;   become a frostbitten quadriplegic in the &quot;deadly vehicle&quot;
&gt;   (are these guys Nader prodigies or what?).

I have a clear shot at the front door of their
garage from my roof, range approx 300 meters so
I'd need the tripod and scope...
