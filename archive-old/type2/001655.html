Greetings all!

I bought my '77 microbus almost 2 months ago in non-running condition, and
have been lurking on the list. Great list, BTW! Finally got most of the
wires and hoses hooked up, and after new points,condenser, rotor, and cap,
the engine actually starts now.

Here's the problem:  it starts up just fine and idles, but while idling, if
the accelerator is pushed, the engine &quot;runs away&quot;, ie revs up real high and
won't return to idle when you take the foot off the gas. This is cured by
pushing the throttle back to idle with your hand in the engine, but persists
next time you hit the gas. Also if you try driving, the engine doesn't pick
up speed very well at all (hesitates).

So basically I'm driving around really slow, not using the gas pedal at all
(b/c it's always full throttle), and every time I push in the clutch it revs
all the way up.


Another question:  I've got smoke coming out of the crankshaft pulley after
the engine runs. Causes/cures???


Thanks a bunch in advance for your input,
