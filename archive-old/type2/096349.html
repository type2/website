&gt; &gt; I took my van for a long journey last night at a constant

&gt; 
&gt; I would certainly have a look at your valves.  You may have overheated the
&gt; engine and that backfiring might have been from gas igniting on contact
&gt; with the hot valves/cylinders/pistons. I find in mine that if the air is
&gt; above 70, and I try to beat 65 by any margin, the oil temps start to shoot
&gt; up.  If I tried to do 70-75 for 45 minutes, I would expect to have to
&gt; replace a head.

my 78 has hyd valves and I'm not sure this is as big a problem, BUT I have
temp guages and I know that at any speed over 55 or so the temps start
climbing.  in cooler temps I can do 65 and the engine stays within the
limits I have set for myself (230 slow down, 240 slow down to 55, 250 pull
over and leave engine run at high idle while it cools down, if it goes up
at all, shut it down and get lunch, have never gotten to 250 following
those rules)

&gt; The proper reaction when buses pass you doing 75 is to wave and smile and
&gt; follow at a deliberate pace.  You will have plenty of time to get to meet
&gt; and know them when you come upon them broken down by the side of the road

or pulled over by the local constabulary since they are everywhere around
here on any road you can think about going that fast.

&gt; further on.  Nod knowingly and smile slightly when they tell you that they
&gt; have no idea what happened.  Check the compression, dwell, and timing by
&gt; the roadside and if all are OK (OK in this instance is any compression
&gt; above 0, expect at least one cylinder to be at 20-50psi) then offer to
&gt; take them for coffee for an hour or two while their valves cool.  After an
&gt; 
&gt; roadside and (b) anyone tearing along at 70-75 needs more gap.  Loose
&gt; valves won't kill an engine, tight ones will.

for sure, one reason I set my hyd at 1-1.5turns rather than 2turns as
reccomended

&gt; responses, but that's my story and I am sticking to it.  You can go fast
&gt; in a bus or you can go far in a bus. Pick one.

I want far, lots far......so far 310k and counting (now if I could get the
auto tranny to hold up as well as the 2liter bottom end)
