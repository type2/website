Which is why I always give 'em my phone number from .. was that three or
four moves ago?  Been so long I don't remember.  SnackShack, the
Safeway/Albertsons/wherever &quot;rewards card&quot; signups, various websites,
etc., etc..   It hasn't been assigned to anyone else since I had it, 
and if it
ever *does* get assigned, I still don't get the junk calls. :-)
