Subject: FS: Complete Westfalia Camper Interior (Repost)

I'm back from vacation and still haven't sold the interior from that 
wrecked '85 Vanagon Westy GL that's been in my driveway since shortly 
before I left.  I posted this about 1-1/2 months ago, and thought I'd post 
it once more.  I wouldn't mind splitting the interior up IF I could sell 
most of it that way, but the only inquiries I got for separate parts were 
for the tables and other minor stuff like that.

This interior will fit any year Vanagon (air or water cooled). Surely there 
must be a Vanagon owner out there who wants to upgrade to a full-blown 
Westy interior. I have just about everything behind the front seats - 
sofabed, stove, fridge, sink, cabinets, tables, curtains, etc.  
Asking $675 complete. I'm in southeastern Pa. E-mail me directly for more 
info.

Thanks,
Ron Salmon
