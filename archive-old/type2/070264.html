&gt; They now sell a solid state electric 'fridge the size of a big Playmate cooler 
&gt; for $90 at K-Mart. Plugs into 12V. Anyone tried one of these out? Maybe stick
&gt; the works from one of those in the VW box for a new kind of 'fridge? How much 
&gt; current do those things draw? Are they more efficient than those old Dometics?
&gt; 
&gt; Seems to me efficiency is key, since 4 hours of wimpy cooling before your 
&gt; battery poops out is unacceptably lame in my opinion.
&gt; 
&gt; Keep cool out there,

Surfer Bob,

I've used one (or 2 or 3 or4) of the 12-volt coolers over the last 3 
years.  First and foremost they are coolers (or heaters if you 
reverse the plug-in) and not 'fridges.  They will cool to about 
40-degrees lower than the ambient temp -- IF, they are not in a 
cabinet or under other objects, etc.  They really need their air!  
They seem to draw about 4-5 amps and this is continuous as they do 
not 'cycle' like a fridge.   If you're going to use one in a vehicle 
(read - Bus) that is closed up with the sun comin' thru the windows, 
forget it -- the beer will be warm and the mayo and meat will spoil 
:-(

All the best,
