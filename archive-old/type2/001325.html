Subject: oil level
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

I checked the oil on my '69 Bus this morning before taking it to work. Right
between the marks. On the way home from work I stopped to get some gas (only
the second tank since I got it so I'm in the oil checking mode) and checked
the oil again. Just a little on the bottom of the dip stick. So I went into
the gas station paid for the gas bought a quart of oil and went back to the
Bus. I figured okay it's had some time for all the oil to drain down and not
wanting to accidentally over fill I checked the oil again still just to the
bottom of the dip stick. I put the quart in and go home. After letting the
Bus sit for a couple hours, and not really believing that the thing went
through a quart in 20 miles without any noticeable leaks or blowing smoke, I
check the oil again. It's way overfull now. Since it's been 20 years since
I've had a air-cooled VW am I forgetting something? How long should it take
for the oil to all drain into the crankcase? Is it operator error, or do I
have a problem?
