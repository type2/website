Subject: where to buy a new engine?

Hi-

I need advice. (actually- premature advise, as I don't have all my facts in
yet.)

I bought the van with a newly rebuilt engine from 'cross country.  (mistake,
but camper van's on the east coast are fairly scarce)  The PO put a lot of
money into this engine.

The case is cracked.  The warranty may  replace the case, which is very new,
except that my  mechanic here brought it to a welder to try to fix the
crack - which didn't work - and now the case is &quot;scarred&quot;, and I will
probably have trouble with the replacement as I have probably voided my
warranty.  I plan to talk to the owner of where the engine was purchased,
but he is out today. Hence my letter to you.

The mechanic here says that even if I get a new case, there will be quite a
bit of labor involved transfering everything over.  At $85/hour, this will
add up quickly.  I am in no position to do the work myself.

I am looking for comments on the above, and also wondering which company you
would recommend if I purchase a new, replacement engine.  It seems like a
new one would run around  $1000 - 1200 (?), plus installation.  I think I
may be better off swallowing my losses and starting fresh.

Any help would be appreciated.

thanks-
