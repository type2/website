Subject: Re: [T2] Fouled head replacement

Spewing oil is a consequence of overfilling. You didn't mean to imply
you thought it was related to your head change did you? I don't think
this would be related. Unless your valve cover gasket is not on
straight. Or some major trauma like craked head or cylinder. But I
would check the simple stuff first.

I've experienced difficulties with fuel until I've primed the fuel
pump. Not always, but upon occasion.

 I replaced the #1 and #2 head recently only to discover an oil and fuel
 leak, lots of it,  coming from some where around my work and ending up
 collecting on the tin that wraps the cylinder. The other side also had a
 small amount on it's tin.  I checked the oiled and discovered I had
 overfilled  3/4 of a quart and the fuel rail was absent of any fuel.
 This is the second attempt, last time I forgot to lap the heads to the
 cylinder.
 
 Any suggestions at this time would be helpful. I haven't the tolerance
 now to research the archieves or flip any pages.
 
 Thanks in advance, Craig
