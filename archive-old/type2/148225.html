Subject: Re: [T2] air tools

You will probably get better answers from others, but to start with,
most don't manually lubricate their tools, but rather run an inline
oiler that attaches to the air output on the compressor, about $20 on
sale at Harbor Freight. I don't know if this is undesirable for
filling tires or painting.

Each tool has a rating for air consumption, but I believe that is a
minimum requirement for it to function, not a maximum.

When you are finished using it, open the drain valve at the bottom of
the tank to prevent rust in the tank from water.

      Most of the tools I have say to oil daily.  What do I oil them with?
 Is there some special air too oil?  How much do I drop in?
      Anything else you can think of to extend the life of the
 tools/compressor that I should know?
