Subject: 71 Blown Engine?!?!?

&gt;&gt; Heading uphill, hauling a lot of weight on a hot summer day.  Oil temp
no hotter than on other occasions.  All of a sudden the oil light comes
on.  I pull over to the shoulder as I experience a gradual loss of
power.  Oil is quickly dripping from the bottom of the engine.  I shut
the engine off and get a tow back to my house.

&gt;&gt; Given that the engine never seized, I'm hoping that the fix isn't going
to kill me financially.  I'm 30,000 miles and 8 years following a total
rebuild.

Did you discover where the oil was coming from? I overheated with less than
1000 miles on a rebuilt engine due to constriction in the vents. I had a
thermal breakdown of the oil and the oil pressure light came on at 55 mph.
Superheating the oil caused it to coat most of the rear of my engine
compartment, but I have not had any trouble with the engine since.

John
