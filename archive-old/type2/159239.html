Subject: Painted Rocks National Lakeshore Road Conditions

Hey Folks,

Has anyone been to Painted Rocks National Lakeshore in the Michigan's UP 
recently?
I am wondering what the road conditions are like.

I already know that the road from Hurricane Camp Ground to Grand Maris
is closed.

I am specifically interested in other roads to Hurricane, but would also
like to know about general road conditions in the area.

Thanks
Steve
