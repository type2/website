&gt; Before adjusting the steering box is there anything else I should be doing?

If the steering box is shot, it will probably feel &quot;crunchy&quot; as you
turn the wheel, particularly at the center position.

Before you adjust with the steering box, check the drag link between the
steering box and the swing lever.  The ball joints in this link can and do
go bad.  Have someone wiggle the steering wheel while you observe the rod
ends.

Fiddle with the steering box as a last resort only.  More damage has been
done by well-meaning adjustments than by wear!
