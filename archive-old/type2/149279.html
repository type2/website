Hi Don,

AC-Delco spark plug boots work well as ninety degree vacuum elbows on  
72-74 carb setups. They have lots of give in them and are a good  
match to the I.D. of the OE tubing.

Happy trails,

&gt; Anybody have the idle tube and elbows for the stock dual solex carbs?
&gt; My mickey mouse setup finally gave up on me while messing with the
&gt; stripped stud. I was using brake booster elbows and a length of fuel
&gt; line to make it happen. But the booster elbows are too small and
&gt; disintegrated.
