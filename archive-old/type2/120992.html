Subject: Re: [T2] painting the tin (color other than black)

Yeah, I think it's somewhat negligable, too.

I also took a look at Jake Raby's site and he has painted engine tin all
sorts of colors.  And if that guy doesn't have a problem painting engine
tin funky colors with his performance t4 engines, then I'm guessing it's
probably not an issue on my stock 2 liter ;).

thanks,
Mike

&gt; Mike,
&gt; Remember this--
&gt; Black aborsbs heat--
&gt; Light color's reflect it--
&gt; 
&gt; Now which way do you want to go with the engine tin ?
&gt; 
&gt; Mine was black from new--
&gt; I don't know what's right and wrong in this situation--
