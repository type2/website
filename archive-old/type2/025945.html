&gt; I just got into removing the axles and servicing my CV joints.  The first one
&gt; I pulled was shot, so I took a little trip on down to my FLAPS.  I picked up
&gt; four new CV joints (just in case) and headed back home to do the dirty deed.
&gt; When I got home and opened up one of the boxes (GKN - Glaenzer Spicer) the CV
&gt; joint was as stiff as a board.  No movement at all.  If I forced it with hand
&gt; pressure (about as much as I could exert) only it would eventually give - a
&gt; little.  Upon opening the other boxes I found they were all like that!
&gt; So............Is this what they are supposed to be like when new?  My old one
&gt; moves around freely and clicks into place just like Bentley says it's
&gt; supposed to.  I know there is a big difference between new and old in any
&gt; mechanical operation, but Man!  These new joints are like rocks.  Help me on
&gt; this one..........I either need some reassurance or some guidance.

Being stiff like this makes it easier to attach them to the halfshaft.
