Subject: Re: How Fast

Not trying to drag this out any further, as I think enough has been said on this subject, but has anyone else experienced a loud vibration at 60+ mph in their Westy? It seems to be coming from the luggage rack section on the roof. Mine ('76) has a new seal, and all the attaching hardware is there. I first noticed it earlier this year while returning from the French Creek campout. I was doing about 70 mph when it started, and it scared the hell out of me for a few seconds til I realized where it was coming from. It does'nt do it all the time, and never under 60, but when it does it's LOUD! BTW, 75 is as fast as I've taken mine to, and I don't care to see if it will go any faster, but it cruises 60-65 no problem.Jeff
