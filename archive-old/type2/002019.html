Hi all.

I was wondering if anyone knew what part number 211 945 285 is?  It is a
grey plastic piece, about 12 inches long by 2 inches wide.  It has tabs that
look like it snaps into something.  I found it in the left rear corner of
the Bus, just laying there, next to the lightbulb socket for the marker
light.  Is this something terribly important?

By the way, I just finished installing a new clutch cable.  My first time.
I used Bentley as a guide, and found it could have been more detailed.  Oh
well, I guess I'll worry about it again in another 25 years.

Mike
76 Bus
