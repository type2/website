Subject: Re: [T2] Best way to pay for a bus if you can't collect in
  person ?

Thanks Steve,

PM on way to discuss the details, this is just tosay in public that it's 
great that you will be our go between and thanks for re-assuring Victor 
and watching over the deal.

Also thanks in advance to any of the other guys Marcus, Barry for 
helping out : )

I'm hoping we can get some photos to make a great little story about 
this.  You know with the number of buses that get imported back to the 
eu these days, this deal is feeling like the old vanagon days where it 
seems there was only a handful of us into buses : )

My wife says a big thank you (in advance) too for this help as it will 
make the whole thing less stressful know that the complicated parts of 
the deal are being dealt with by familiar names.

Lee
