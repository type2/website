Hi,
  I wrote earlier about converting my bus to CIS. I am currently in Chile 
and have been noticing many later model bay windows[must have made them long 
after discontinued in the states.
  Does anyone know what fuel delivery system they used?
  Carb?
  Refined Bosch EFI?
  Bosch CIS?
  Just wondering if my CIS conversion Kit is a junkyard away.
  Thanks,
  Pat Price
