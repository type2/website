Subject: Re: [T2] More windshield wiper troubles...

&gt; I was having some troubles with my wipers, so I
&gt; tried to fix them.  It sounded simple enough, so i
&gt; thought I'd give it a shot.  2 wiper assemblies
&gt; later, I'm in a jam.  I ended up tightening the
&gt; screw on the outside too tight, and stripped the
&gt; thread of the wiper shaft.......twice. 
&gt; 
&gt; Where I'm at now, is trying to get the the one good
&gt; thread from the one assembly, and trying to put it
&gt; on the other assembly.  The problem is, I can't
&gt; figure out how to get this darn circlip off to
&gt; remove the shaft.  Does anyone know how I would go
&gt; about getting this small part off?  If you don't
&gt; know what I'm talking about, it's a small washer
&gt; like piece holding the smaller shaft in a larger
&gt; tube.  Any suggestions?   I'm aiming to get it off
&gt; with out destroying it.  I may just end up buying a
&gt; new one from a parts bus.  Thanks in advance.

You're in luck, Rob. I just happen to have one of
those assemblies sitting here in my living room! I dug
it out of the heap and proceeded to pop one of the
circlips loose. I just used needle-nosed pliers
pushing as equally as I could on both the ends at the
same time and on the fourth try it came loose. The
previous tries one side or the other of the pliers
slipped off.

You could also use a thread file if the threads are
just crossed up a bit. On the ones I have messed up
over the years, the nut has always given up before the
threads on the shaft. Have you really studied that?
