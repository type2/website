Subject: FREE in Seattle by 8:00pm -- doors for 1970

YOU MUST BE WILLING TO PICK THEM UP BEFORE 9:00am Tuesday....  I'm in Renton
425 204-1925.  Right off Exit 4 of 405.

2 front doors, one left one right.  Complete with glass.
1 sliding door.

Both in very good shape.  Sliding door has some minor rust near seam (one
tiny spot easily welded and grinded) and tiny dents on bottom..

These are off a 1970.  Cream / white color.
