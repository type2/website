Subject: selling Stuff

I know this has been mentioned before, but please POST THE LOCATION of the
ITEMS for sale.

If anyone is interested it will help them to know just how far they might
have to drive to buy the damn stuff from you, or to pick it up if it is
free!

So Art, where is this 76 bus.  I told a buddy here in Saint Louis about it
and he is interested.

Thanks,

Charlie Ford
