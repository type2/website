Subject: Re: [T2] Hydraulic lifters - mistake to r...

I would also recommend also taking a look at:

http://www.shoptalkforums_dot_com/viewforum.php?f=1

Jake's a regular at those forums. There are some big discussions on 
hydro versus solid lifters.  Good reading.

&gt; I want to thank you. The last go around on this &quot;evil subject&quot; I was 
&gt; convinced that I would never use those &quot;heathen lifters&quot; (oops I meant
