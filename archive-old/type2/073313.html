Subject: tire recommendations?
Message-Id: &lt;v04011700b398106ff7d1_at_[4.16.26.71]&gt;

I want to replace the rear tires on my new '71 westy. the tread is pretty
thin, and there are some potentially bad cracks in the sidewalls. Anyone
have recommendations for what to get? I know that i shuld look for
light-duty truck tires, but i'm wondering there's a preferred brand/model
of tire i should look at. Since i don't have a lot of time, i was hoping to
just go to one of the big tire places, like Goodyear or Sears.

thanks,
