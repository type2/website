Subject: Re: Westfalia Sticker-- here?

If anybody's interested, I have the big WESTFALIA sticker that goes on the 
back of the poptop (came on '79 bus thru '91 Vanagon, but could go on any 
year).  I ordered it from the VW dealer a while ago, was going to put it on 
my '77 but never did.  Paid way too much for it (around $35, I think).  
Would sell it for $20. (I think now you can get aftermarket repros for 
cheaper still, but that wasn't the case when I bought this sticker.  It is 
the genuine VW one.)
