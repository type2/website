If you take off the case, you may well be able to see the heat stressed
points. If you can file the points perfectly, they then have much less mass
to absorb heat and will fry in a few days or weeks, that is, if you can
somehow get the tension of the copper strip reset right. 95% of the time
this is a total waste of time/money. 

Buy a new one, or get a salvage part and hope for reasonable life. Same
double relay will be found in F.I. Beattles.

&gt; Also, the fuel pump (due to running for days on end, I suspect) is now
making funny wheezing &gt;noises like the bushings/bearings are shot.  

Any noise from a Bosch pump more than a clean hum is indication of imanent
failure. 

&gt;Can a fuel pump be rebuilt? If so where do I get the parts?  

Not even Bosch rebuilds fuel pumps and they have all the parts which we
can't get. Take a hint. 

&gt;A new one seems very expensive.

Yeah, I know, and they function nominal for how many years??? Just like the
relays and by-pass valves and pressure regulators and switches and...
