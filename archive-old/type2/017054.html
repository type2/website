     ???? My '69 certainly had the rear tranny mounts -- I had that
engine out more times than I care to remember and never supported the
tranny. My '81, now that had no rear tranny mounts. Made it easier to
pull the engine too, but harder to get it back in. 
     My last go-round with my '73, I pulled both engine and tranny
together, the only time I've ever done that, but I think I'm sold on the
concept. In the '80 -83, of course, you can easily remove and replace
the tranny without pulliing the engine.
