&gt; this brings up the point, when you buy a can of WD40 or other similar
&gt; &quot;stuff&quot; there is usually this little red &quot;straw&quot; taped to the side.  pull
&gt; it off, use it once and then it is promptly lost..... anyone know where to
&gt; get those things????

&gt; used rubber bands on the can but the WD40 eats the rubberbands.

I use a &quot;koozie&quot;--also known as a can cooler--for my WD-40. Stick the WD-40
can in the koozie, stick the straw between the can and the koozie, you're
all set. Two Charlotte printing shows ago, koozies were The Thing for booth
vendors to pass out as souvenirs, so I came home with a box of them--no two
alike. Most dollar stores have koozies with the name of some insurance
agency or factory printed on them.
