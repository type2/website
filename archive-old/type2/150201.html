Subject: Transmission swap

I need to swap out the transmission in my '73 Riviera. It looks like I
grabbed a bad one from the stack when I put it together &lt;sigh&gt;. Starts
howling at about 40mph and the clutch/input shaft heats up and stops
releasing after 50 - 100 miles of driving.

I'd really like to fing a 091 but I have spare 002's.

I also have access to a 914 - 5 speed. What would be required to install
that? It is NOT a side-shifter model but I haven't been able to get a close
look at it yet. Known good when pulled though.

Gerald
