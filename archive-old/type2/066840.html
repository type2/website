&gt; I did read T.E.K-A.A.T., bladder totems, lime-light neon dusk, and
&gt; all, but I was in the eighth grade at the time, and can't say I
&gt; remember it too well.  Correct me if I'm wrong: Kesey's bus was a
&gt; full-sized school bus, nicht wahr?

Further sits (sat?) over in Pleasant Hill, on his farm for years, just 
slowly returning to the earth from whence it came. I noticed it years 
before I realized it was 'famous'. As I recall, it's an old Reo, or some 
such.

A few years ago, &quot;it&quot; showed up again in the Eugene festival. Come to 
find out, it wasn't the actual bus, but another that he'd built to look 
sorta like the original. There was some minor scandal about how he 
claimed it was the original, but turned out to be a fake. As it turned 
out, he explained the original was used for parts to bring the new 
Further into being.

Although not the original, it has a similar paint job. I understand that 
it was going to head across the country again, but I never heard if it 
actually made the trip.

&gt; Just saw one o' them highly dayglo (VW) buses rolling down Rt. 1 past
&gt; my house yesterday, matter o' fact.  I was psyched.  It's rare to see
&gt; a VW bus period here in NJ, so spotting one in full dayglo is a
&gt; Definite Event (tm)!
&gt; 

I just saw a bus (a loaf) the other day that had a velvet paint job. I 
don't know how many of you remember this paint, but it was rather 
unique. It came out in the early 70s. You'd spray on a base coat, then 
overshoot it with &quot;velvet&quot;... and the end result was something suitable 
for Elvis' Last Supper.

This van was painted in day-glo blue. I don't know how he kept the 
finish alive. It can't be waxed, and it deteriorates quickly. I suppose 
the van has been lying covered in someone's garage since it was painted 
25 years ago.

For the painters in the crowd: Do you remember applying this finish... 
or at least seeing it? How about the fake vinal tops? You'd stick on the 
&quot;seams&quot; then shoot on a coat of &quot;bubble&quot; paint. Or even Emron (Imron?)? 
You couldn't make a mistake with that finish, and it was like spraying 
on a coat of rubber. These were the &quot;hot&quot; custom finishes of 72.
