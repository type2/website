Subject: M121 Fresh Air Fan - under dash?

Hi Everyone.  I've writen a bunch of times and everyone has been a great help.  Thanks.  
  I have a question regarding, what I think is an M121 fresh air unit that is mounted under the dash of my 1978 champain edition sunroof bus.  I can email pics to you if required.  here is the problem, it does not work insid the bus.  There are cooling fans under the bus that turn on but the fans inside do not work.  I could be completely wrong on the unit name.  It has two round knobs on the front, one max and min temp, the other is a fan speed.  Under the unit is a toggle switch that I believe turns the interior fans on.  Please help me identify what this is, the bus did have A/C?  and help me get it working?  Thanks..

Please email me if you have any questions,

please help.

Thanks again,
Mike
