Subject: Pump Removal?
To: type2_at_type2_dot_com

Hello,
    I bought a 1977 Westy about a week ago.  Can
anyone tell me how to unhook the water pump thing that
is under the plastic water container?  I am cleaning
it out-it's really dirty and staining it, but I can't
get it off.  Does it unscrew, pull off, or...?  I
can't figure it out.  Thanks a lot.  I got a lot of
help from this list helping me buy this camper.  I
really appreciate all of the help you have given me.

Peace,
Tim
