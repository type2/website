Sounds like you weren't at TDC for each cylinder when you adjusted it.
I've found that, although theoretically you can adjust a valve at any
point where it's fully closed, if I don't do it at TDC, they come out
wrong.

You could also have worn push rods or rockers.  Try checking them when
cold, then rotate the engine a couple of times, and see if they're the
same or not.  If they change, then that's the problem (probably the
rods), and they need to be replaced.  I'm not sure what the
implications for the camshaft are, but probably not good.
