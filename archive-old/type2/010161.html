Scoob hath writ:

...and take a
&gt; picture of the two busses sitting together with the members as the
&gt; pass-off.  I will also create the web site to document the journey. 
&gt; Most every member must be near a kinko's with access to a scanner, and
&gt; if not then I will gladly scan them in myself...

My understanding of the race and some suggestions:

Busser1 leaves east coast at &quot;X&quot; time on &quot;X&quot; date with destination of
busser2's place of residence (or a pre-arranged meeting place) at least 150
miles away (i'd wanna discuss/adjust that one - less distance=more
participants+shorter trip legs) with late-model VW emblem.  At end of trip,
Busser1 and 2 accost unsuspecting passerby (passenger maybe?) and force
individual to take goofy foto of selves beside busses (maybe even with number
signs to indicate place in relay) with Relay Emblem. Busser1 heads home, stops
at 1-hour photomat, then at kinko's and ends up with JPG file of Busser1 and
2's  meeting.
Busser1 sends JPG file to &quot;Great Bus Race&quot; (please ignore moniker if 'race'
has neg. conotation...) webmaster for posting or posts image to type2 list
with maybe a trip report attached.

I think Charlie said the receiving relay-er would post mileage, etc.
Would it be easier for passer to do this after his trip, maybe?

Meanwhile, Busser2 is heading west to Busser3's place (or pre-arranged meeting
place) to repeat performance and so on until somebody from 'Team East' rolls
into the  J.R. gathering in OK.

The same would be happening on the west coast with bussers heading east.
Whoever hits the gathering in OK first is the one who gets to start the
overseas leg by shipping the emblem to whoever in Finland or Australia or
whatever and then the thing would just keep moving around the planet as a
symbol of universiality of VW maintenance, repair and enjoyment.

Once the relay teams were established in the US- we might be able to use them
(or us) as a cross-country transport system - kindof a 'VW parts bucket
brigade' of sorts.  Maybe a little too Rube Goldberg-ish?  

Exciting idea Charlie!  lets do it!

Count me in. I'm in Eastern Ky.  zip is 40351
