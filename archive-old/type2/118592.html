Subject: Re: [T2] Engine tin screws

Why do you say the Phillips head style screws are the worst?  I've worked
with both and generally prefer the Phillips head since you're not as likely
to &quot;cam out&quot; with your screwdriver if you come at the screw at something
other than a perfectly &quot;square&quot; angle.  There's a spot or two on these
beasts where there's no way you can get perfectly &quot;square&quot; with the driver
because of inference from other parts; regular slotted screws are a real
PITA in these places.

Subject: [T2] Engine tin screws


&gt; I took off the engine tin to do some painting and I stripped one of the
screws. I should have had a small impact driver present but I manged to get
all of the tough ones off that make a loud crack when I broke torque.
&gt;
&gt; The originals are the ubiquitous metric phillips cheese head style (the
worst design). I see several people sell kits of shiny slotted engine tin
screws. I assume the bug and bus screws are the same except for a couple of
places where length is a concern. The part numbers seem to be the same.
