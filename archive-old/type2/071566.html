&lt;&lt;  have been
 told by more than one mechanic and lubracation specialist, that synthetics
 do not disapate heat as well and will actually raise the engines temp 5 to
 10 degrees.  Does anyone have an answer?  I have been running mobil 1 in my
 1978 Dautsun 280z for 8 years.  I bought the car with 138,000 miles on it,
 it now has 413,000.  I change it every 2,500 miles and everytime I adjust
 the valves (every 30,000 miles) I am amazed at how clean under the valve
 cover is (good stuff).  Still have full compression and no oil loss between
 changes.  I want to run mobil 1.  It is worth the additional 10 to 15
 dollars an oil change for the benifits I have seen with my other car.
 Please respond to the heat question.  I don't like conflicting answers. &gt;&gt;

what i am going to say is a factual test i conducted myself.  on both my 72
westy, 73 van, and 74 bug i installed oil temp sensors before ever using
synthetics.  after swicthing over one year the temps all remained lower by a
minimum of 7-10 degrees.  i no longer use oil temp sensors as the oil runs
cool and consistent even on hot days.  my 73 van is used for work, hauling
heavy loads on long runs.  have yet to have a problem.  and yes it is nice to
look in the valve covers and see it sparkling clean isnt it.  

there is going to be a ton more  responses on this FART.  but everyone needs
to do their own research.  if it sounds good to you and you have thought it
out and have spoken to people you trust or whatever your method is of
investigation, then do that.  if you love castrol and have used it for 30
years and have no desire of trying new products then stick with it.  if
synthetics work for you then go for it.  i am pleased tho that so many of the
readers here are interested in better products and
technology........ahhhh....the beauty of a thinking mind.( one of the reasons
i decided to join the list.....a lot of good opinions on here....)
