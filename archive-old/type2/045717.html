Subject: [T2] Type2, Type IV ?????

I have a 78 Westy, 2.0 L engine w/FI. The reference to &quot;type*&quot; has me somewhat
confused. I believe I have a type2 body style w/ a typeIV engine. Is this
correct? What is the difference between a Type2 and TypeIV engine? This may be
elementary to this knowledgeable list , but is confusing to me.
Thanks for the help.
Frank W
