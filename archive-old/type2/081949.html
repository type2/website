&gt;I put in a new cam that came with a bolt-on gear.
&gt;
&gt;If the gear with the notched tooth was not oriented right the timing would
&gt;be screwy.

This should have been noticed when the valves were adjusted.
It would also explain why the engine was trying to run backwards.
If there are no marks on the piston tops your valves are not bent.
