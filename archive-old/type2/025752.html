John Connolly sends:

&gt; On an upright engine, you have to remove the engine from the car, then pull
&gt; the cylinder heads to take the tubes out. The only other option is aluminum
&gt; expandable tubes, which can be installed on an assembled engine; getting
&gt; your old ones out is the toughest job. However, there is only ONE brand of
&gt; expandable tube that won't leak (that's all we carry).

And even getting the old ones out isn't all that hard: take out the
pushrods, squish the tubes in the middle with a pair of vise grips (the
large economy size is good for this), then use the biggest screwdriver you
have as a lever to bend the tube. It will pop right out.

Or use aviation snips to cut them in half after you squish.
