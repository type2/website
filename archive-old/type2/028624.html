Hi Volks,
Well, to start this saga, I had a great running 1600 DP with Jacobs ign,
Berg extractor, and balanced to the max. So I decided to play mechanic and
add 1.25 rocker arms and dual Kadrons. Added the 1.25 rocker arms and ended
up with the push rods galling against the push rod tubes and a big leak
developed. Pulled the engine, replaced the push rod tubes, set up the 1.25's
so they would work right and put the engine back together and in the bus.
Synced the carbs and fired it up expecting a sweet running engine. GUESS
WHAT......

Engine runs great- up to 3000 rpm where the power falls off and it starts
popping. This only happens under acceleration. If I go up a little bit at a
time, it still lacks power but doesn't pop.

I have checked for vacuum leaks, timing, valve adj., and messed with the
carbs till I'm I don't know what else to do.  Anyone out there in VW land
had a similar problem? Any ideas where to look or what to look for? I'm
clueless (my usual mechanical state). Any help, information, ideas,
suggestions, ANYTHING, will be greatly appreciated. As always, TIA  TBear

Don't take life too seriously- you'll never live through it.
