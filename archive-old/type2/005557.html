I haven't decided yet if I would use the heater when camping. I have to
admit it sounds tempting, but I haven't even fired up my BN-4 yet so I don't
know how it performs or that it doesn't burn clean, etc. I would have to get
a co detector to run it all and feel safe.

My question now is: are there many people running the BN-4 on the list who
have had good experiences with it stock location or otherwise?
 I would like to hear some people say they use theirs all the time and never
had a problem with it, even using it at night when camping.
  I have bought all the stuff I need to install it and am only a breath away
from doing it. More input for or against it sure would be appreciated!!

&gt; Steve:
&gt; I see where this is headed and am really concerned that some of you out
there
&gt; are considering using the BN-4 or BA-6 as a camping heater. Carver (or
Porpex)
&gt; made camping heaters and possibly the newer Espars for truck sleeper use,
might
&gt; be okay, but I sure wouldn't trust any of the old Eberspaechers that I've
had
&gt; to make heat clean enough to sleep in all night! I'd want to add a
flexible
&gt; exhaust pipe about 10 feet long at least. IOW, they were ALL stinky! Clean
&gt; enough if you were moving, but scarey if sleeping. I don't think they were
ever
&gt; made for that.
&gt; At very least I'd carrry a portable CO detector.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Also has anybody else thought or gone through with installing the
heater
&gt; &gt; &gt; somewhere else besides the engine compartment? I was thinking maybe
&gt; &gt; &gt; under the z-bed.
&gt; &gt; Hmm,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Running fuel lines in the passenger compartment is a big No-no, much
less
&gt; &gt; burning it there.  You are on your own, but from a safety standpoint i
&gt; &gt; dont think i'd ever consider putting a gas heater inside the bus. What
if
&gt; &gt; it springs a leak in the middle of the night, you want it separated from
&gt; &gt; yoru sleeping loved ones (or if you are single &amp; love yourself, loved
&gt; &gt; one) by 1 foot of airspace or a firewall?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Yeah, I know some old splitties had one inder the dash inside the bus 3
&gt; &gt; inches from the passengers Knee, but ask me if I am looking for one...
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; take care,
&gt; &gt;
