&gt; very low wind speed.  But yes, the flat-plate area should be the same.

I'm glad you accentuated both the low speed, and the point about the 
roof rack. It seems &quot;obvious&quot; that any object that breaks the clean flow 
of air over the surface, such as a roof rack, would cause additional 
drag. At higher speeds, this drag adds up quickly. Annecdotely, I've 
seen the addition of a large roof rack drop mileage by 25% on a fairly 
streamlined vehicle... attesting to the power needed to overcome the 
additional drag.

What I found interesting is that the design of the rear surface is 
nearly as important as the shape of the front. As speeds increase, a low 
pressure area forms at the rear of a boxy vehicle... which increases the 
total drag. The addition of a small roof mounted air foil dropped this 
loss by 35%, in one test, by diverting airflow into the low pressure 
area. (This test was done on an American station wagon, traveling at 65 
mph.)

When reducing drag, one area often &quot;overlooked&quot; is the underside of the 
vehicle. A VW is fairly &quot;streamlined&quot; in this area when compared to its 
front-engine/rear-drive counterparts. I understand that lowering the 
vehicle, and adding an air dam, helps in this area.

All in all, the bus just has too much surface area, though. With twice 
the surface area of many (most?) cars, it's gonna push some air.

BTW, I'm surprised by the high drag given for the car mentioned. I would 
have thought it to be closer to the drag of the newer Camaro (something 
like .19, if I recall).
