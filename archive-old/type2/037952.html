Subject: A very handy tool

In the hopes that this is delayed until the Friday offerings, I've slapped
together a nifty tool for (content) working on my bus.  Dumb as a brick,
but...  if you nail together two 2x6 pieces, maybe a foot long each, the
narrow side of one perpendicular to the flat of the other, right in the
middle, like a cross...  you can lay the flat side down and the &quot;fin&quot; up and
it makes a great stand for a clamp on studio light with reflector for
working under the bus.  There's enough mass in the wood that's it's very
stabile, which means you can knock into with your arms and it doesn't tip
over and break the bulb, leave you cursing, etc.

It works so well, and is so cheap and reliable, it reminds me of.....

Yep.
