Subject: brakes

Hi,
The brakes are one of the next things to check out on my bus
and I wanted to know what others feel about these questions.
Does the rule if it &quot;works&quot; dont mess with it apply to brakes?
I dont have any problems stopping and have never heard
any funny noises from them. The only thing that didnt seem
good was when I bought my bus there was no brake fluid in the MC.
I filled it up and I haven't had any problems since, and my
brakes are not spongy so I dont think any air is in the lines.

I thought about bleeding the brakes and adding new fluid but
heard someone say the crud will be removed and leaks
could start.

I want to be able to stop, but should I worry about
anything or just wait till they act up?
kinda stupid question :&gt;

Have a good weekend everyone!
alex,
77 w/79 engine
