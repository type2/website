Hello all,

Can someone tell me which way round the hoses to the above mentioned
thermostat should be.  I have a CJ engine, the pre-heat arrangement may be
the same as the 1800 engine, not sure.  This may be the source of most of my
cold running problems.  My Haynes manual doesn't tell you which way round
they go, in fact the picture only shows one hose.  I have the short hose
from the flapper diaphragm going to the closest of the two connections
(sorry, can't remember if it was left or right).  If this is correct, I may
have a faulty thermostat.  Don't blame me if it's the wrong way round, it
was like that when I bought it.

As an experiment, I bypassed the stat last night by connecting the vacuum
hose directly to the diaphragm and went for a test drive.  The bus ran
perfectly where normally it would be cutting out even after 5-10 minutes of
driving.  This wasn't a very controlled test because it was quite warm out
last night, but then the bus had been sitting in the garage since Saturday
so I'm happy enough with it.  I'll keep the bypass arrangement for now and
see how it works over the holidays (we're going to my parents for Christmas,
200 miles away).

I hope you all have the best Christmas and New Year ever
