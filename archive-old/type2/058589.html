&gt; Subject: Be honest... How fast?
&gt; Okay everyone:
&gt; Honestly.
&gt; How fast do you drive your bus?
&gt; 
	[]  Although I don't put a lot of long highway miles on my bus, 
	I have done 2 hour runs in 95F weather at 70MPH.
	I did a 4 hour run at 70-75MPH, but looking back at the road we 
	were on, and the handling, brakes of a bus, that was a bit scary,
bordering
	on irresponsible.
	I work at the top of a fairly long hill, and have no qualms about
heading up that 
	at 65 -70MPH. Now mind you I have to hit the bottom at speed because
the van won't
	gain more than about 5MPH over the two miles up the hill.

	My cooling system is stock, complete, and working. At the end of
	two hours at 70MPH, the dipstick handle is not warm, and I can hold
my hand on the
	fan casing.

	I've been told by several old VW mechanics, as well as some people
who drove them during 
	the war, that VWs were designed to be driven at full throttle on the
autobahns - indefinitely?
