Subject: EZouts.... Help(??) stripped screws

John,

I second what you say about EZouts......  after all, you're working
with a much smaller diameter and applying more torque.  When they
break (and even the best quality ones do), you are well and truly
sunk.  In my experience they are useful only if the bolt is reasonably
movable.

Helping a friend, I had some luck heating his broken EZout red hot, to
negate its hardening, so we could then drill it out and re-tap.......
but if he had heated the bolt red hot to begin with, he wouldn't have
needed the goofy EZout.

The problem here is that some folks are not comfortable with heat.  To
use heat sensibly you must first prepare the area, removing trim
(certainly wiring as well).  And yes, for sure, you will ruin some
paint.  But if you have a helper hold a wet sponge on the outside
surface, the net damage does not have to be all that bad.

Usual qualifiers, YMMD, IMHO, &amp;c, &amp;c.........
