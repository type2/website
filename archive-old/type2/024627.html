My son and I drove 220 miles to Norcross, Ga for a Porsche swap meet and
auction at PAP in the 75 camper that I bought last October. We were loaded
pretty heavy (we temporarily took out the sink and ice box cabinet to lower
weight in anticipation of driving to Hershey, Pa for the big Porsche swap meet
in April). I drove between 65 and 68 due to the load.

My son bought 4 914 seats for $10--it was a take it all or none deal--he only
wanted 2. That was probably the straw that broke the camel's back. Coming home
about 50 miles from Atlanta and 150 from home and climbing a slight rise, I
heard a Pop or Pow--not at all like a dropped valve or other catastrophic
failure. I thought a spark plug had popped out.  The engine died! On
checking--nothing seemed broken or popped out of the Fuel Injection/ and the
engine was locked up. Not a good sign.

Long story, short we had it towed 150 miles to Knoxville at a reduced rate of
$350!!!!!

Pulled the engine last night. Only minor shavings in the oil. Anybody want to
guess what broke before I tear it down and find out? I'm guessing the cam.

Besides rebuilding the engine for dependability (and joining AAA+ for $74 year
that covers 100 miles of towing) I am probably going to do something that goes
against the main thought of this list. I'm going to either a single carb or a
Kadron type dual carb setup.

After pulling all the FI connectors and looking at what a bunch of parts is
there, I am ready to trade the driveablitity of FI for the simplicity of a
carb setup. I plan on parting out the working FI pieces so if anyone is
interested in reasonably priced spare parts for their systems, let me know.

I am going to re-read the archives before I make this move, but looking at the
complexity of the system and driving the bus only on weekends, I'm pretty sure
I'm going to do. If anyone has successfully used either a single carb or dual
aftermarket carb system, please contact me. Owning a 60 356 Porsche with dual
Zeniths, the dual carbs don't scare me.

Bummer of a weekend!!
