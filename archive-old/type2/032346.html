&gt; hey...
&gt; if you do this though...you'll probably have to get a new ignition coil if
&gt; you have the original Bosch coil (like I did) because it only has 3
&gt; terminals....2 positive...1 negative that goes to the distributor already..

--&gt;  I don't see why.  Yes, there aren't enough terminals, but this is
easily solved with a wire splice.  Heck, they even make crimp-on wire
connectors with an extra tab on them, for putting two connectors on one
terminal.  That's how I hook my tach up, and it works great.
