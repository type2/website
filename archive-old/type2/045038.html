Subject: [T2] noise insulation

Howdy:
Anyone out there have suggestions more noise dampening materials to be used
in the engine compartment (in my case of a '70 Westy)? I read about using
the NASA insulation on the &quot;Heat, Rust and Noise&quot; page, and I thought I had
a source for it at Home Depot, but it was the wrong stuff. Besides, I'm not
sure I'm crazy about my engine compartment looking like grandma's tin-foil
lined oven. What else have people used in addition to the crappy tar boards
to keep down the din?
Bob
