Dave (and others)

Great!!!  As I said, I am very happy to be wrong on this.  I don't know
what the functional difference between the round and square ones is, but
the bug is a much lighter vehicle and I have always worried about using
the bug damper... Now to go find one for the '73...  (which will soon
have its nose in the air for a new axle beam anyway :-)

&gt; It is labeled 211-415-417(made in Mexico).  It is square with metal
&gt; bushings where the bolts go thru.  It appears to be made in two parts as
&gt; there is the remnant of a seam between the top and bottom.  It has a hole
&gt; in the middle about 3/4&quot; in diameter
