Subject: OT: EB2003

&gt;&gt;Just visited the eb03 site ... Is all the
things mentioned really a problem?

I went to EB02.  No problems that I saw.  I would
bring my children without reservation.  Remember
that it is a city park, and the rangers did seem
a little nervous about all of us hippy geeks (in
reality, very few were hippies-- most are techie
geeks).  Never the less, I'm sure every instance
of an open container was brought to Chris'
attention.
