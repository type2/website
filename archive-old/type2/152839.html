Subject: Re: [T2] rappin, buckin, barely runnin

I had symptoms like this in Betty after i rolled her :(  .. (she was a '73
westy that i installed an '83 2.0 and converted to L-jet FI)  but i know
that one of the problems i was having was due to the excessive fuel pressure
- which for L-jet I believe is supposed to be between 28-32 psi.

I replaced my fuel pressure regulator and the bucking/bad acceleration went
away - but at the time i was so fed up with her that i sold her within a few
days and don't know if really fixed the problem.

the other thing that clued me in on this was from 0-60 she wold buck and
grumble, then after 60-65mph she would just cruise - hence the amount of
fuel being poured down her throat....sigh...anyways - I would test your Fuel
pressure first, then maybe even refer to the FI troubleshooting guide....

Good luck!

&gt; So I'll try to make this short and sweet.  I mean sour!  =(
&gt;
&gt; 1978 Volkswagen Transporter/Campmobile.  Prior to trip (of 40 miles), no
&gt; rapping, no nothing, purring like a kitten.  Compression 90, 130, 130, 135
&gt; (not great with the 90 there, but figure she's still got some life in
&gt; 'er).  This engine has approx 13,000 miles on it, was a crate exchange from
&gt; a company in CA.
&gt;
&gt; Heading to the destination, 30 miles or so, starts making a rapping sound,
&gt; temp at approx 90 deg c (oil dipstick sensor).  Plenty of oil
&gt; pressure.  Some power loss and bucking.  Thought it was a fuel problem 
the
&gt; bucking  still not resolved.  If I plant the accelerator/quickly open the
&gt; throttle, no increase in RPM; if I slowly open the throttle, RPMs gradually
&gt; come up.  Replaced the fuel filter, problem remains.
&gt;
&gt; Return trip, still rapping, bucking, left anyway, rapping got worse,
&gt; backfiring started, throughfiring, major power loss, until it stopped
&gt; running and will now start but not remain started.  Had it towed to the
&gt; house, where it sits awaiting repair.
&gt;
&gt; Rapping sounds like something more central to the motor than
&gt; valvetrain.  No loose/sloppy rocker arms, all valves seem to be moving
&gt; properly when the engine is running.  All valves adjusted a few months ago.
&gt; Timing is right.  No loose vacuum lines near as I can tell.
&gt;
&gt; Engine is a 2000 cc FI, hydraulic valves.
&gt;
&gt; Any thoughts?  I am praying for a miracle
