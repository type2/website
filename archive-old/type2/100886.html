Subject: Re: Praise for a vendor (The Bus Company).

&gt;      I haven't heard allot about The Bus Company (TBC) on the list, so I
&gt; wanted to put in my opinion.  [ . . . ]  I would, and probably will
&gt; do business with Ken again if I need anything.

I've had the privilege of stopping by Ken's place here in Seattle to pick
up parts.  Similar experience: his inventory is extensive and impressively
well-organized, he's every bit as helpful and conscientious as you
describe, and his prices are better than fair.  Especially compared to the
relatively poor customer experience of ordering parts from most of the VW
specialty vendors, I'd go with Ken any day.

p.s. -

Am I alone in my understanding that the customer experience
for ordering a VW part online is still in the dark ages?

If I buy a computer part -- for example, a network card or a DVD drive --
even if it's from a cut-rate no-name vendor, it goes without saying that
the item will ship within 24 hours and that I'll receive a tracking number
by E-mail.

When I order a VW part, it's like the old days of mail order: I submit the
form, maybe get an automated confirmation from the web site, and then wait
for up to two weeks with no communication whatsoever.  The general rule
with respect to order staus seems to be &quot;don't ask, don't tell.&quot;

Sometimes the package shows up with the right part, sometimes a box comes
and it's not what I ordered, and sometimes nothing shows up at all.  I've
had orders fulfilled incorrectly (or not at all, with no notification of
cancellation) by three of the bus-friendly vendors whose names are
familiar to the list.

*sigh*

&lt;/rant&gt;
