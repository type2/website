&gt;Ok, here’s one for which I need as many ideas as possible:
&gt;
&gt;I have a ’71 Westy; 1776 engine and freeway flyer tranny.
&gt;I had slippage in the clutch; no amount of cable adjustment would correct
&gt;the problem.
&gt;
(The flywheel surface seemed a little shiny to me, but
&gt;there wasn't any oil or other foreign substance on it, and I didn't give it
&gt;a second thought once I wiped it clean. Should I have &quot;sanded&quot; the contact
&gt;surfaces?)

The flywheel should be reground and the depth reset to spec. The thickness
of the plate should also be checked for spec. Wear of the throwout shaft
fingers can add to this problem.
