Subject: Re: How to remove door lock cylinder?

Pull the handle out of the slider door.   That usually has the code on it.
and it usually pulls right out if you take out the inner screw.

&gt; Bussers,
&gt; I am trying to determine the lock cylinder code on the '70.  As part of the
&gt; process of the never ending body/paint job in my garage, I have the front
&gt; door handles off.  I have the exploded diagram from Haynes, but can't be
&gt; sure how to release the cylinder, if indeed the code is available on it.  An
&gt; alternate question, assuming the latches are all the same key code, (you
&gt; know what happens when we assume), what is the easiest way to get a key code
&gt; to at least have a key to try.  I'd hate to have to hire a locksmith.  TIA
