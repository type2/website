For all y'all out there doing these conversions:

First the easy way is to go to:
http://www.french-property_dot_com/cgi-bin/ifp/convert.pl
a really nice conversion script.

Second, if you just want to see it, and stand amazed, amused, befuddled,
and confused.... 

1 US fl. oz. = 1.0408 UK fl. oz. =  .0296 L		
1 US gal.    =  .8327 UK gal.    = 3.7854 L

1 UK fl. oz. =  .9608 US fl. oz. =  .0284 L
1 UK gal.    = 1.2009 US gal.    = 4.4561 L

Don't you wish Thom Jefferson had gotten his way and the US had just
started out with the metric system in 1776?? :-)

In theory, there is no difference between theory and practice. 
But, in practice, there is.
