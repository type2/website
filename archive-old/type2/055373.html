Subject: Westy to the rescue!!!

Hello All!!!

 I have to relay this, it tickles me to no end!!! I just got done pulling my
sons Chevy Monza with my bus!! I bet that it was a sight to those who live
around me, you don't normally see a Westy towing things, much less another
car. Since this is Friday, I felt the need to tell the list about this for
two reasons....1- to boast about my Westy, and 2- to embarrass my son (he
didn't think I would tell the list!)

Happy Friday everyone!!
