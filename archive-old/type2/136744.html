Subject: Re: [T2] Choice of Power Inverters?

Tough to host dinner parties in the depths of winter with snow, wind, and rain.... &lt;grin!&gt; 

I did however exist just fine with less personal space for several years when I was in the Navy. 

Never realized until I was out for a couple years how valuable a Westy would have been the whole time I was in the Navy... DUH!

Chris
