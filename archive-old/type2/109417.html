Subject: RE: [T2] Argggh!..what did I miss?

&gt; I am putting together my new engine(for my 78) with 72-74 
&gt; heater boxes and tin.
&gt; 
&gt; The 72-74 heater boxes holes are *round* and the control box 
&gt; tubes that are supposed to fit on them are *oval*.. 
&gt; Do you gently squeeze the oval shape to round??? or have to have 
&gt; the correct tubes from the heater box to the control box?
&gt; If I can squeeze them to a round shape, will they fit 
&gt; correctly and match up to the flexible heater tube to 
&gt; frame holes for my 78?


As I recall the body mounted tubing is the same, but as you noted,
you'll have to find a way to make a round hole connect to an oval tube.
You could try to bend the tubes, or try to form a short piece of heater
duct or flexible exhaust tubing into an adapter. Perhaps both; use the
latter as a &quot;sleeve&quot; to seal any gaps that may be created by bending the
tubes. You also have to do minor engine tin fabrication to the '75-78
engine tin, or use '72-74 tin as you did. (And, as I'm sure you already
know, you won't have an EGR filter port anymore.) 

Yes, it's a bit of a pain, but consider the alternative. Keeping the
stock '75-78 U.S. spec setup means using two exhaust manifolds, two
U-shaped pipes, and a crossover pipe, all of which serve only to
restrict air flow, provide more opportunity for leaks and failure, and
are unavailable as replacement parts, leaving you screwed if one rusts
out. An absurdly complicated setup designed just for us lucky North
American buyers (as the rest of the world got to keep the simple '72-74
setup until '79). Find a way to go from oval to round, and you have
eliminated all of these superfluous parts for good.
