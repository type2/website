&gt;pull the mats up periodically and there would be water.  Well finally this
&gt;weekend we decided to go at it again.  Well there is that vent in the hood.
&gt;There is supposed to be a black container with a rubber seal and a hose
&gt;attaches to that and you run it outside the vehicle.  Then the rain goes
&gt;into the black container through the tube and outside the car.  not in the
&gt;passenger compartment floor.

'70s busses have a similar fresh air intake on the front.
The metal chamber behind the fresh air grate on the front has a drain.
A  two-piece plastic hose attaches at the bottom of the chamber, in front
of the left side lower heat duct.  The lower end of the hose goes through
the floor and out the cabin via a hole behind the kick panel, in front of
the clutch pedal.

I heard (alot of) water sloshing across my '73 while turning.  The upper
part of the two-piece plastic hose was found draining into the area in
front of the kick panels.  The lower part of hose was nearby, plugging
up the drain hole in the floor.  I drained &quot;the swamp&quot;, then fit the two
pieces of hose back together, the leak stopped.  Why is this a two piece
drain hose?  Seems to me that a one piece hose would have fewer
leaks.  Just thinking out loud.   :-) :-) :-)
