Hi everybody,
I just wanted to make sure I had to do all this before I actually did it.
Do I remove the fan, all the cooling tin, the oil cooler, and the parts 
around the fan before removing the heads?
Also, if I look up through the exhaust port at the valve and it looks redder 
than the otheres and the walls look darker and uhneven would these indicate 
a burned valve.  (it does open and close when the engine is turned by hand)
Thanks,
Kyle
