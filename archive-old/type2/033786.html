&gt; HI, this is Beth - I hope this is not considered a frivolous question! 
&gt;  Is there any way to make driving in the wind less terrifying?  We had
&gt;  forty mile per hour winds here near Atlantic City the other night and I
&gt;  thought my beloved bus and I were about to get blown off into the
&gt;  ocean!  As for names, my kids call my bus the Beetle Bus, so that is its
&gt;  name.  I truly love it, and as all my friends have said, it is very ME. 
&gt;  It is so great to have this list to help me with all my bus needs.  Beth

Hi Beth,

First off ensure that your shock absorbers, steering damper and anti-roll bar 
are all fitted and to spec.

Ensure the tyres are inflated to the correct pressure - checking then at the 
filling station will result in them being under inflated as a warm tyre will 
always read a higher pressure - so check them at home with the tyre cold.
(of course you could make an allowance based on checking at home then at the 
filling station with tyres warm)

I fitted a spoiler, side skirts and heavy duty sway bars which all had some 
effect, but the thing that made the most significant difference was fitting 
tyres with a higher side wall strength. All this was really to avoid 
replacing the 5 good tyres I had fitted at my local tyre shop which were only 
4 ply (I had only owned a T2 for 4 weeks and it was the tyre they recommended 
- I don't go there any more).

Eventually I replaced the 4 ply tyres by 8 ply and if I'm honest this was the 
only thing I did which SIGNIFICANTLY changed the side sway on a vehicle which 
otherwise to spec in the suspension department.

Good luck
