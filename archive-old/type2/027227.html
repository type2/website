&gt;&gt;And you've never had points fail?  Really this is one of those preferance 
&gt;&gt;things and some people just aren't comfortable with them.  I've had the 
&gt;&gt;same pertronix for about 3+ years I suppose it will fail eventually. &lt;&lt;

Is there something wrong with the VW application of the Pertronix unit?  
I've had the same Pertronix Ignitor in the vacuum advance distributor on my 
Ford 302 since about 1995 and it's seen lots of hard, off-road, hot miles.

The only reason I have not put one in my camper is that I'm still trying to 
decide whether I'm gonna ditch the 009 for a vacuum actuated distributor.
