Subject: Loud ticking sound was My engine is smoking after rebuild

The smoking has stopped after running for 10 minutes,
thanks for the help everyone, i guess i was paranoid
with breaking in the new engine correctly.  Now that
it has stopped smoking it has a loud ticking sound
similar to when you cold start an already broken in
engine.  Was wondering how many miles this should go
on during break in before i should start to worry and
what might i check as the cause?
