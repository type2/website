Subject: Re: Pre-Purchase Questions about  '72 Camper 

&gt; 
&gt;I'm considering a '72 camper and would appreciate help with a few
&gt;specific questions and any other sage advice.  The bus is out of town, so
&gt;I'll probably not see it until I'm ready to hand over the check (assuming
&gt;reality matches the verbal description).
&gt; 
&gt;The upholstery appears to be the main problem.  Was this a two 
&gt;bucket/bench configuration?  Any estimates on cost and suggested sources 
&gt;for replacements?

Yes.  Used/junkyard seats would be cheap.  '68-75 would fit.
&gt; 
&gt;I'm in Texas, where A/C is a major consideration for at least 3 months of
&gt; the year.  Can A/C be fitted to this model?  If so, are they easily 
&gt;found? Again, ideas on cost and sources?

Was available as a dealer-installed, not factory-installed, option. Fairly 
difficult to find. Does put quite a strain on the small motor.  I have 
heard that this can be lessened by using a more efficient Japanese Sankyo 
compressor in place of the original York compressor.  If you are 
interested, I do have a used AC setup that I would sell (condensor and 
underdash unit only, needs a compressor).
 
&gt;Are there any other features or quirks about this model that I should
&gt;consider?
&gt; 
I'm sure I'll get flamed for this one, but '72 is by far my LEAST favorite 
year of the bay-window bus. It was the first year of the pancake (&quot;type 
4&quot;)motor rather than the upright (&quot;Beetle&quot;) motor.  Compared to the '71 
bus, the 1.7 liter motor in the '72 was just enough bigger to be a major 
pain in the neck to work on, and had just enough more torque to wear out 
clutches too quickly, without having enough increased output to be worth 
the hassle.  VW quickly realized their mistakes, and the next year added a 
top access hatch for the motor (making the '72, the only year with a type 4 
motor and no access hatch, the hardest year ever to work on) and a larger 
clutch. By 1975 the bus was further improved with an even larger clutch, 
improved brakes, fuel injection, and a 1.8 liter motor that had noticably 
more power.  Also, from '74 on (and particularly from '76 on) the Westfalia 
camper layout was much nicer.  
If I were going to look for a camper, I'd either get a '71 (the best of the 
bug-engined years), which has the identical layout as a '72 but a much more 
reliable and easy to work on drivetrain, or a '76-79, which in my opinion 
is the best that the Westfalia Bus ever got.  '74-75 ain't bad either.  But 
personally, I would never want to own a '72 (I say, as I get ready to duck 
the slings and arrows of any '72 bus owners on the list).
Then again, if the price were too good to refuse...
