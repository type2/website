Subject: Bus Tour rolls on.

The Pechenik crew (Me, wife, 2 kids, daschunds) took a couple hour trip to
meet the Mike Green collective (Mike, very nice wife and 4 kids, dogs at
home)  at about the 1/2 way point, Islamorada in the Keys.
Our first year (68) loaf and his last year (79) loaf, met passed and
pictured the hub cap-n-stuff. 
Mikes beige over brown 79 is as nice as Ive seen and his family as well.
Picture the kids from Mr Mom and add a little girl in the group. Cute.
cheers
