&gt; Eugene,
&gt; 
&gt; How do I gain access to these articles?
&gt; 
&gt; Sounds like a good info source.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks much!
&gt; 
&gt; Dave &quot;da 74 bus man&quot;.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;My info comes from the late Gene Berg's 801 series of Tech articles. I &gt;would
&gt; &gt;recommend these articles to anyone running a VW.

&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Do you have some evidence of this?  I have used the anti-sieze for several
&gt; &gt; years now and my engines run cool and have no problems with spark plugs.
