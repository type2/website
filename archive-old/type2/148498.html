Subject: Re: [T2] Heat Exchanger Quality

I wasn't bashing Ron or Bus Depot. In fact, I haven't had a bad
experience with BD, except for some slow emails. Not a big deal. Ron
sells the parts that he can get to sell. Nothing wrong with that. In
this case, caveat emptor only applies to what sometimes passes for
replacement parts.

What blows my mind is the difference in quality between NOS and so
called replacement part quality. It was stupefying to put the HE's
side by side and see the difference.
