Ah, with a chill in the morning air, here come the heat questions. I have 
ridden in two '78 buses that had had stock heating systems that were in good 
shape, and they both put out a fair amount of heat. Enough to defrost the 
windshield? Not if you're in a hurry. Here's a tip I got from someone at a 
campout a while back. This guy kept a 1500W heater in his bus during the 
winter months, with an extension cord running into his house. When he got up 
in the morning, he'd turn it on, then get ready for work. By the time he 
left, say 30-45 minutes later, the bus was nice and warm. Good idea, unless 
you live in a high rise apartment. Also, I got a Rocky Mountain Motor Works 
catalog yesterday, was disappointed to see they are now selling that pathetic 
150W ceramic heater, for $24.95. For newbies on the list, let me warn you 
this thing WILL NOT HEAT YOUR BUS! It wouldn't even keep a Karmann Ghia warm. 
Even if you hold it in your hand, it will barely keep your fingers warm. 
Don't waste your money on this piece of junk.    Jeff S.
