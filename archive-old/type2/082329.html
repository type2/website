&gt; Type2folx,
&gt; 
&gt; Does anyone have starting jetting info for dual Solex 32-34PDSIT on a 
&gt; big-valve 1.8L engine?
&gt; 
&gt; We don't know the original source for the Solexes, but are pretty sure they 
&gt; 
&gt; are from a 1.7L T4 engine.
&gt; 
&gt; We are putting them on a 1.8L that had been poorly retrofitted with a Weber 
&gt; 
&gt; progressive, thinking that we would have better performance out of the 
&gt; duals.
&gt; 
&gt; If someone could tell us how we need to configure them for the 1.8L, we 
&gt; would 
&gt; mightily appreciate it.
&gt; 
&gt; main jet 135
air correction jet 175
pilot jet 55
accelerator pump 0.9-1.1cc      
throttle valve gap 0.6-0.8mm

I hope this helps.
                         regards Mel
