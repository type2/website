&lt;&lt; I still liked the increased airflow (I think 240 cfm). So if anyone can
suggest a heat resistant blower that would work, I would like to try
that. Has anyone tried the JC Whitney kit? I am afraid that it may
contain the same plastic bilge blower.

I ran across an early Bay with what looked like a factory
squirrel-cage blower mounted under the floor with a
pull switch on the dash...Anybody else ever come across
this?
