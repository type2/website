Subject: RE: [T2] 69 campmobile transport and dimensions

Hi Karen,

I'm not sure if your Campmobile is a poptop or non-poptop, but my '79 Westy 
poptop is 6'-9&quot; tall.  However, I did manage to get it into one of the Pearl 
Street parking garages the last time I was in Boulder.

As for getting your Bus from TX to CO, why not drive it?  Do all the 
required tune-up &amp; maintenance, print out all the AIRS pages for your route, 
and allow a decent amount of time for driving.  Who knows, you may end up 
surprising yourself by driving it all the way there with no trouble.

Good Luck!
