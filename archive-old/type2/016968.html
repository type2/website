&gt; hi everybody,
&gt;         I have an automatic bus which has been converted to a weber
&gt; carb. The bus ides fine but when you try to give it gas it stalls. It
&gt; appears that the accelerator pump isn't doing anything. Can you
&gt; purchase rebuild kits for these carbs. Its just a single carb not dual
&gt; carbs. Its on a 73 1800 type 4 engine. Also where is somewhere i
&gt; can get some more information on thses. I would appreciated any
&gt; advice others can give on this conversion. Will the stock vacum
&gt; dist do fine or will i need to purchase a different kind? Any tuning
&gt; insights?
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks

Greetings to all. You never heard of me yet because i'm a newbie to the
list. By the way, it's a pleasure to read you all.

Here's my answer to Phil's question : I do have a Weber progressive 2
barrels on my '72 1700 cc Westy. I have changed the distributor for a
009 because mine had too much wear in the shaft. I also read in an old
Clymer shop manual, wich had a performance improvement section in it,
that the Weber carb doesn't provide the same rate of vacuum than the
stock carbs, and that's why they recommended installing a centrifugal
only distributor. When doing this, it's important to plug the carb's
vacuum line, in order not to burn the valves. (Vacuum leaks burns valves
according to St-Muirs) Notify that I don't want to restart the old
debate : Mechanical vs stock distributor, here. I did it on my van and I
find that everything works fine this way.

For finding Weber carbs rebuild kits, here's a good adress on the web, I
must say that I never ordered there yet, so I can't comment on the
service. &lt;http://www.larrysoffroad_dot_com/index.html&gt;

One last thing, Phil, I set my fast idle cam when cold at 1500 rpm and
when the engine is hot, I set the idle at 900 rpm. For the volume
control screw, I set it at 1¾ turn to the left.

Hoping this will help you somehow...
