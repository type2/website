Subject: Heater parts

Hello all: I've just about got all of the BA6 gas heater together except for
the bits and pieces that it did not come with it. Unfortunately my attempts
at rigging all the pieces together following the wring schemata do not seem
to work. I am now looking for parts of the wiring harness up front
(connecting relay to switch) and the aux. fan. If you have these parts
please let me know.

PS. I have hooked the system up to a battery charger capable of delivering
10 amps. Would this be sufficient to &quot;turn the thing over&quot;, because if it
isn't, that may explain why it won't run (without gas mind you).
