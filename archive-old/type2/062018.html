Subject: trip report

Hello all,
I am now back at school, so any mail sent to my summer e-mail account
will not reach me.  My address here is sbart7kb_at_mwcgw.mwc_dot_edu .

I drove yesterday from Johnson City, TN to Fredericksburg, VA, which is
a trip of about 400 miles.  I had the van heavily loaded with pretty much
everything I own.  It's weird but it seems like I can fit more stuff into my
bus than I can fit into my dorm room.  

The bus did well, I kept the speed around 60 and kept a close eye on the
oil temperature, as the day started out cool, but got up to 90 or so.  Oil
temps stayed low for the most part, except for an unexplained reach up
to about 235-240, but then came back down.  Ever since I replaced the
pushrod tube seals, oil consumption has dropped dramatically, I don't
think I burned any on the way up.  Well, maybe a little bit :) .  

It's amazing to me that this bus, with 67 horsepower and a FULL load,
can hold 60 mph up hills.  I am impressed.  The bus performed flawlessly,
never missing a beat.  I drove from Johnson City to Roanoke, which is
where I usually get gas, and instead of taking $12 worth, like it usually
does, I could only get $7.50 worth into the tank.  Not bad.  I must have
had a tailwind or something.  I also got surprisingly good mileage on the
Roanoke-Fredericksburg leg of the trip.  The hot start problem did not
crop up, it looks like installing that relay really did cure it.  

Well, since the bus ran great, I really don't have anything to report.  It
was a good trip.

Sean
