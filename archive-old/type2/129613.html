Subject: Re: [T2] VW's take on tires - Owner's manual and Bently specify
  these  tires.

Hi George,

I would also think that this is a good time to remind people that the 
front brakes do 75% of the stopping. Meaning that the front tires are 
subjected to a higher than normal load when the brake pedal is pushed. 
And when cornering the tires on the outside of the corner carry more 
weight than the ones on the inside.

So when you're cornering and braking at the same time (highway 
off-ramp) you can expect that one of the front wheels will be carrying 
more weight than any other two put together.

I'd like for people to think about that BEFORE they put car tires on a 
bus.


Happy trails,

&gt; Be careful, the rear axle carries more than half the weight of the bus!
&gt; Note that the front pressure is constant at 30PSI regardless of load, 
&gt; but
&gt; the rear pressure can be as high as 44PSI, indicating that the rear
&gt; wheels are carrying significantly more load than the fronts.  If only 
&gt; 200
&gt; pounds of the evenly-distributed weight of 1267 pounds is shifted to 
&gt; the
&gt; back you end up with 1067 on the front wheels and 1467 pounds on the
&gt; rears, over the max load of the 195/75R14 load range C tire and
&gt; approaching the specified maximum load of the 185R14 load range C tire.
