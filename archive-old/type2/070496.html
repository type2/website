Weston,

First, understand that I am loaf kind of guy, so this may not apply, but..

Replacing tie rods on the loaf models is not that big a deal.  JC Whipme
sells a puller, or a small puller from a FLAPs will pop the ends right
out.  New loaf tie rods cost ~$50.  On the loaf, the left rod is fixed
length, so adjustment is not an issue.  The right tie rod *is* adjustable,
and I have always had good luck placing the new and old rods back to back
and adjusting the new one to the same overall length as the old one.  A
front end alignment is still in order, but the &quot;match game&quot; keeps me safe
to the tire shop.

On the torn boot:
Theoretically, if it just happened, you could just replace the boot.
Never been able to find replacement boots, personally, so I have never
done this.

On doing both at the same time:
If it's just a torn boot on a low mileage vehicle, no.  But let's be real,
you are almost certainly approaching at least 100K miles.  Yeah, I'd do
both. Total cost is ~$100 and for that you get peace of mind.
