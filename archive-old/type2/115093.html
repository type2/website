Subject: R: [T2] clutch cable

Previously I wrote:

&gt; My clutch pedal went &quot;bang&quot; this morning and it looks like one of the cable
&gt; strands has broken away from the crimped end at the back by nut. The cable is
&gt; 13 years old and I think the last one broken in the same way. Before I put my
&gt; travelling spare on does anyone have any advice for keeping the corrosion away
&gt; from that stress area? Just grease it up some?

I should have know I was pushing my luck. The first strand broke this
morning. The bulk of them on the way home:

Luckily I could still disengage it but barely.
