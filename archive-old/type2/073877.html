Okay,

It's taken all day and I can't get the part now, but
it seems that I am without a cylinder head temp
sensor!  Looks like whoever did the cylinder head (3 &amp;
4) forgot to reinstall it.  Guess it will wait until
Monday, or maybe I'll get lucky and find one tomorrow.

Thanks again for all of the help.
