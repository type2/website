Subject: 78 front alignment query + how to check ball jts?
References: &lt;4.3.2.7.0.20010622144551.00aabe90_at_mail.phila.k12.pa_dot_us&gt;


My front tires on my high milage 78 Westy are wearing severely on the
inside half of the tread, and I took it to in to Goodyear for an
alignment check and to ask whether flipping the tires on the rims to
bring more tread life.
They checked the alignment and the toe was toed out considerably and
they fixed that-(due to a previously bent tie rod that was replaced)-
the camber on the front right wheel is like -0.11 degree when it should
be positive (can I assume that at 60 min per degree, the Bentley setting
of + 40 min is like equal to +0.66 deg??  The left wheel is  +.78 deg,
which I assume is within the (+-) of 20 minutes either way of 40?  They
said flipping the wheel would make it continue to wear in the pattern
set....is that just a way of selling me tires sooner??
     Can inside wear be due mostly to the toe being that off?  Or of the
camber being off one wheel?  When I first noticed it I tried to set the
toe using a telescoping curtain rod but it's hard to get the right front
and rear using the tiresd or rim.
BTW, how do you check ball joint play- what tool will work??
