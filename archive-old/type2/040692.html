Subject: Need Rim in MA

	Hi All. I finally was able to afford (and talk my SO into) four new
tires for my 70 Westy. I now find that I have three 14 inch rims and two 15
inch. A search of local junkyards here in Brockton MA turned up nothing.
Does anyone have a rim they could sell or a suggestion of a source? 

Thank You
Jeff
