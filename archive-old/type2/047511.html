Hi!

New to the list.  Just bought a 68 crew to restore (anybody have a back seat
to sell?)

Anyway, I spotted this ad in the SD Union that I was sure would be of
interest to the list:

71 Bus/Transporter, immaculate, show condition, must see to appreciate,
Appraised at $45K, $38,500 or best.  858-271-2077

Good luck!

Dave
