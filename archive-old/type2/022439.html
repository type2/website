Super, Beth !
Now then, stop &quot;trying&quot; to view this all as a learning experience.

When you go to get the proper plugs, buy yourself and extra set.
Nice to have on hand, and not much money involved.
Make sure the engine is cold when you install the plugs.
Use some anti seize compound on the threads of the plugs so they will 
come out easy later on down the road.
Don't over tighten them. The plugs are threading into pretty soft metal 
when you work on a VW.
Start threading by hand at first and make sure you can thread them 
pretty far on by hand just to make sure you are not cross threaded.

Did I see somebody else recommend an electronic ignition module for 
your distributor?
That makes two of us recommending this, if that is the case.
Once a Pertronix or Compufire module has been installed, your days of 
replacing and adjusting points are gone.

Congrats on hanging in there !
