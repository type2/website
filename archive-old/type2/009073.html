Message-ID: &lt;19990427123943.20419.qmail_at_nwcst021_dot_netaddress_dot_usa_dot_net&gt;

hey all-

i have a chance to get a fridge/sink unit out of a 83 westy.

two questions- what do these usually go for?

how hard would this be to retrofit in to another bus? does the fridge run on
lpg/12 volt/110 volt?

if anybody could shed light ob this i would appreciate it..

michael
