Subject: Re: [T2] Re CV knocking

If a CV joint goes in a bay window bus (maybe any car for that matter) wouldn't
the vehicle just cease accelerating?  The spider gear inside the tranny would
just spin like crazy... (which is bad mind you...) and you'd just pull over to
the side of the road with an immobile bus.  I'd avoid driving any high speeds if
at all possible of course...like i said...I wouldn't take it out of town.  If
you must drive it and the CV joint lets go...stop immediately...let off the gas
right away.(if my theory is correct...I've been wrong many times before mind
you..)  If you can drive something else to school to finish up...that would be
best.  If I don't go to these last 4 days of school...i don't graduate on time
(semester early).  Hell...I'd drive a Pinto to school if I had to just to get
out of there!

Not trying to disagree with you or anything Britt... curiousity more than
anything really...

&gt; Dallas,
&gt; Not to contradict what Isaiah said but I'd be careful with a noisy CV joint
&gt; and drive cautiously. If you are roaring down the freeway at say 55mph and
&gt; that CV decides to let go.. well use your imagination. Just think of sort of
&gt; a hammer spinning at many many rpm until you get it stopped. If you have any
&gt; sort of a wrecking yard near you maybe a spare axle would be prudent? Good
&gt; luck!
