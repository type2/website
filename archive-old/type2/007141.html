Hi all,

I am in need of the seat belt recepticles, holders, whatever, for the
two front seats.

The PO removed the belts, and I have them, but the two recepticles,that
are bolted to the sides of the seat, that accept the belts when layed
over your lap, and shoulder, are missing.
( I don't know how to exactly explain them)

Does anyone on the list have any of these that I could purchase?

Thanks much,
