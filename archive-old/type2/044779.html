Subject: Re: [T2] Oil levels

Smittie sends:

&gt; What does the list think should be done at this point?
&gt; 
&gt; 1. Drain off the extra oil before heading home tonight
&gt; 2. Drain off the extra oil after I get home tonight
&gt; 3. Don't bother draining off the extra oil at all
&gt; 
&gt; My drive home is over a mountain highway (No. Cal. Bay area's Hwy 17). It is
&gt; something of a workout for the bus.

I vote for 4. Drain off the extra oil, then find a different mechanic.
What's the first thing you do after putting new oil in? Check the level!
