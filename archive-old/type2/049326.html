&lt;&lt; Is this sealing compound something that is readily available, or is it 
 something sold to the trade?
 What's this stuff called, by product name, if anyone knows.

Hello again Bob  &amp; list   I have found the best way to install the windshield 
in a bus is to use masonary cord , silcone spray, start at the top , finish 
at bottom.   I don't like hitting the seal, but push only on the seal not the 
glass. After installing use 3M  #08633  sealant with the needle gun to seal 
under the seal   .   Mark Dearing  Salem Import Service  Salem Va.
