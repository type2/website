Hello all you folks in bus land,

        First off, I'd like to thank all of you that gave me advice on
my starting problems. It turns out that the PO used some of those pinch
type wire connectors, and on closer inspection, the connection and some
of the wire was burnt. After I replaced the piece with a better piece of
wire, and a butt connector, it fired right up. What is happening now is
cylinder #2 is acting up. When I pull the wire off of the distributor,
there is no audible engine change. No misfiring, ect.. But, when I try
to start it with that plug out of the engine, it won't start. Every
other cylinder is acting fine. Also, the last time I changed the oil, it
had gas in it. I remember seeing something in the Muir book about it,
but I can't seen to find it. Any words of wisdom?

Thanks,
Nathaniel
