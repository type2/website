&gt; I have the two heater box / exhaust extensions off.  Are the heater boxes supposed to be loose or somehow fastened to the exhaust pipe inside?

They are supposed to be crimped closely around the exhaust pipe at the
entrance and exit.  Since this is the hottest part of the sheet metal, it
tends to corrode away here first.

I repaired my boxes by cutting 16ga metal strips, bent them into
half-circles, forced them into the gap between the sheet metal and pipe,
and brazed them to the sheet metal.  I didn't try to braze them to the
pipe, since the original sheet metal crimp wasn't brazed.

This fix puts a much larger &quot;foot&quot; against the pipe and should outlast the
original setup.  It's much better to repair an original box than to use a
substandard replacement that is commonly available.
