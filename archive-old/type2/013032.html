I'll try to keep this brief. :-)

I left Tallahassee around 10:30 Friday morning and took the interstate the whole way to Jax, which is a bit unusual for me in a bus.  But (maybe due to my new SVDA 
dizzy), Big Red was very happy at 65mph the whole way, other than the usual wind buffeting.  Great power and cool runnings, mon.

Decided to loop around the north side of Jax this time and take the Mayport Ferry across the St. John's, which I highly recommend.  I pulled up and within 5 minutes 
was on the ferry; crossing took maybe 10 minutes all told, and let me off not 5 miles from Hanna Park.  $2.75.  Beats the snot out of 10 miles of traffic lights coming 
out the beach road.

Checked in with no problem and had a great site on the end of a row across from the woods.  (Some of Hanna's sites are a bit close.)  Not long after setup a couple 
from SEVWC dropped by -- I'm terrible with names -- and we jawed for a while.  I took a little snooze and then strolled over to the beach around sunset.  Who should 
I run into on the walk over but Bill and Janet from Hillsboro, NM, whom I'd met at Jerome last year!  They were in the middle of touring FL in Melvan, their sticker-
beplastered 62 DD camper.  Later that evening Kris and two friends from the St. Pete area pulled in with a 61 westy and 67 standard (forgive me if I'm off on details).

Rolled into the Bus show around 9AM Sat.  Perfect weather, and I'd say about a dozen splits, 10 bays, and a handful of vanagons, along with a few rare Beetle-
bodied Busses (I guess that's what they were; why else there? :).  Swaps were a little disappointing both days, although I did find a set of wide-hatch jailbars for $25 
(minus middle bracket) and a new 63-67 Bentley manual for $69 total.  And of course couldn't resist a couple of toys.  I did win a Drag Bus in the raffle. :-)  

A weird highlight to the afternoon on Saturday was the exhibitionist girls who kept cruising by in the back of a Camaro, flashing and grinding to the general approval 
of most of the by-then-a-little-bored bus owners along the back fence.  Attention was so focused on their next appearance that I coulda scored Dave E's or Kris's 
privy tents right off their busses and they wouldn't have noticed.  (I hear the young ladies ran into trouble with the law a little later on.)

After the show I was fortunate to get a ride in Melvan to Singleton's Seafood Shack in Mayport, where Bill and Janet and I admired the carved ship models and 
scarfed excellent local fare while watching the ferry cruise back and forth on the St. John's.  This is a must-see / must-eat experience.  Afterwards the three of us 
wandered around Mayport checking out the lighthouse, old school, woodpeckers, and kittycats.

Back at the site, I hung out with the split group at Kris et al's campsite for a while, enjoying the great company (Ted and Andrew down from Atlanta with Dave, and 
Dan (?) and more folks my old swiss-cheese noggin' can't recall the names of -- but nice folks, funny and friendly).  I'm told that later some of them decided to check 
out one of the &quot;Gentlemen's Clubs&quot; outside the park -- which is right next to a Navy base -- and found it &quot;weird and scary&quot; (even compared to other like 
establishments) according to Dave.  Imagine an exotic dancer place that caters to squids being like that! ;-)

The Sunday show was bigger, with a little more swap action but not really stellar.  Ran into Laing from the Tallahassee VW club with his nice yellow 71 Ghia vert 
(plenty of choice Ghias at the Sunday event, including Rich Swann's coupe).  Kept bumping into David from Gainesville while wandering around the show.  I *think* 
that's everyone I saw....

The ride back to Tally was uneventful.  Kept being amazed at the 71 westy's power.  It really wanted to go faster than 65 but I was forceful. :-)  By the time I hit Live 
Oak I was sick of interstate driving and so took US 90 the rest of the way, loafing my way across the fields and small towns.  Great trip!

Ended the day and the weekend with a nice cruise around town in the 65 standard around sunset.
