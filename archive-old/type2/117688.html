Subject: Re: [T2] fuel inFection questions

Jamie,

Surely some of the other folks that have had this problem will chime up, 
but it sounds like the classic temperature sender loose/broken problem.

Seems like when I got mine running, I connected the temp sensor
again, but didn't get it stabbed together inside the plastic connector 
correctly.  It was there, but the two connectors were just rubbing 
together rather than *connected*.

Cheers, dave

&gt; it will fire, and you can rev it up and it will stay running 
&gt; Now , Every time you turn the key, it fires up,, runs for about 4 seconds , then
&gt; dies off

&gt; Thanks
