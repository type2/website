Subject: re: Door handle

Hi Volks, (Nikki, Kim et al)

I have an interior handle from a 73 that will be available as of Sunday.
There will also be a list of other parts from the 73 that will be made
available once the motor and transmission have been transplanted into the
79. &quot;Free to a good home&quot;

I will try to get a digital pic of it posted tomorrow... right now it's
pitch black and raining cats and dogs out...  Sure hope the rain lets off so
I can get the motor work taken care of this weekend.

Amongst the available usable remains of the 73 will be the instruments, the
front bumper, mirrors, external trim (except for door handles) floor mats,
etc. There might be a few items I charge actual money for, including the
jalousie windows, top single cot and pop-top, but the small stuff will be
free to a good home.

Let me know what you need, and I'll see what we can do.

&gt;
&gt;I just went through this on The List! Since you have a 71 and the spice
&gt;cabinet is in the way of the inside sliding door handle when you close
&gt;the door from the inside (68-74), you're looking for a double-ended
&gt;handle for that. Some kind person -- I forget who but hopefully they'll
&gt;come forward -- has pictures of that handle. They're *really* hard to
&gt;find and I'm trying to talk somebody into fabricating replacements.
&gt;Anybody? Anybody?
&gt;
&gt;Also, I'm not sure if the 71s have the &quot;silent closing&quot; handle towards
&gt;the rear of the inside of the sliding door, but I think that's just a
&gt;standard inside door handle. Anybody? Anybody?
&gt;

&gt;
&gt;&gt; Does anyone have a picture of the interior door handle on their web
page??
&gt;&gt; I have an older bus and have no clue that the newer ones had it.
