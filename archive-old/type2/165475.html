Speaking of which, I have a set of Westlake tires on my '71 in 185R14C.
That size isn't mentioned in the list of recalled tires for this
manufactuerer, but I think that it would still be wise to avoid this
brand.  I'll see how mine do across the Mojave in a couple of weeks.

It seems that with anything from China, the importer has to watch the
manufactuer constantly if they want to keep the quality level up.

Of course, the worst actual tread separations I've had were on two
different high-dollar Michelen tires, on two different vehicles.  I don't
buy Michelins any more.
