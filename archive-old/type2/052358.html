Subject: [T2] Weddle Engineering?

I just tried the number listed below (from archive) and was told it is no
longer in service.

No number given and a web yellow page search turned up nothing...

Anyone know if they are still in business or how to get in touch with them?
I am looking to upgrade my 71 nosecone to a 76-79.


Thanks,

Brian
