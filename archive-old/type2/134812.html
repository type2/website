Subject: Re: [T2] VW emblem anchors

From: &quot;Mark Hineline&quot; &lt;hineline_at_ocotillofield_dot_net&gt;
&gt; The solution to this problem of stolen emblems is to paint a trompe
&gt; l'oil emblem that looks real until you get about six inches away from
&gt; it. Of course, then the vandals might key it.

Or install a really inexpensive plastic one that's molded to break into
pieces if someone tries to get it off.  Maybe after a few attempts, word
will get around that it's just not worth the trouble anymore.

Too bad no one makes one of those things...
