Subject: Cardone caliper right hand side 1971

I witnessed two Cardone 19453 calipers in the last two days that Kragen 
ordered for me. Both calipers had a single bleeder screw located at the 
bottom of the caliper. That prevents proper bleeding unless the caliper is 
removed and placed upside down every time it needs to be bled. Both had the 
pistons cutouts properly located, that is pointing downward.

Having seen two of them wrong, I will conclude that Cardone does not know 
how to make the difference between a left and a right caliper core on the 
ealy disc braked bays. Watch out...

My challenge is now to get a correct caliper by the week-end. Anyone in San 
Diego knows a place that could have them in stock ? Mark ??
