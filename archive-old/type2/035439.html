Subject: Re: Ball Joint Boot?

Dealer cost for new ball joint boots:  $22.50
New ball joints with boots from your local VW shop:  $22.50
Smile on driver after all new ball joint replacement:  priceless


I've had the same problem and the only place you can get the boot only is 
from the dealer.  Coincidentally you can get the whole enchilada(ball joint 
and boot) for the same cost from an aftermarket shop.  

Good luck,

Don
