Subject: Re: [T2] Is 20w50 Oil OK in the winter

I think oil is something personal, I live in SC and I
run 10-40 year round, but I did live in Maine for six
years, there I had to go to 5-30 to start in below
zero weather, whatever makes the van start the best
without blowing the oil cooler off. Phil
