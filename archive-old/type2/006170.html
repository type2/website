Scott, nice trip report. Sounds like your bus prep paid off, and your trip
seems memorable.._dot_despite the plethora of 10V batteries :(

However, you might want to withold judgement on NEVER wanting to return
East. I said that the first 4 or 5 of 15 years out there (including 2 at the
NPG school in Monterrey, near that beautiful village of Carmel). Eventually
however, I truly missed it back here (FL/NC)...and chose to retire here...in
affordable-land :)

Regards, Marv Krupp
