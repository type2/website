Subject: Re:  Dash Brake Warning Light

To all:

Thanks for the multitude of helpful responses.  However, my question was 
not:  Why does the brake warning light come on all the time, but rather:  Is 
there a way to test the light device itself to make sure it is functioning.  
There's no point in taking apart the master cylinder if the fault is in 
that little dash switch, is there?

Thanks again,

Adrian
