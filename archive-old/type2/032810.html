1982 Air-Cooled Vanagon AdventureWagen For Sale 

During the period from July to now that it took to get an official clean 
title on my 1982 AdventureWagen, which I was going to restore to be my 
camper, I found a cherry 1975 Westy and bought it just in time for the Fall 
camping season.  Now I have to decide whether to sell the A'wagen as is, redo 
the engine and hopefully sell it for much more as a fully functional A'wagen 
or, heaven forbid, part it out.  So I'm offering it here on the list first 
before doing anything else.  This would be a great buy for anyone who's good 
with engines and wants a Winter/Spring project.

The body is straight and in great shape.  The tan and brown paint is good but 
a little dull.  It should not require repainting unless you want a brand new 
shine.  It is essentially rust-free except for a few spots the size of a 
pencil eraser from rock chips and some rust on the thin metal trim strips 
around the side windows.  The interior is good except the front seats need 
new upholstery and the side curtains are sun-faded and a little brittle.

For those of you not familiar with the AdventureWagen conversion, this 
company is/was in northern California and run by Mr. Ed Anderson, who I've 
had the pleasure of talking to on the phone.  He converted VW's from the 
'60's into the mid-80's and a few F*rds and Ch*vys later on.  He's 
essentially retired now and no longer doing conversions, although he 
sometimes helps resell old units.

I've heard the AdventureWagen called the land yacht of VW conversions. The 
interior cabinetry is teak.  The rear seat converts to a full-width bed with 
another full-width pull-out bed up top.  There's a custom high-top with side 
windows and a sun-roof, along with tons of storage space.  Equipment includes 
a propane tank, propane stove, 12V/120V refrigerator, sink, stainless steel 
fresh water tank, gray water tank and thermostatically controlled propane 
furnace.  Just turn it on, set the temperature and forget it.  According to 
the DPO everything including the furnace was working when he bought it.  

The existing engine may be good.  I don't know.  The DPO said it was &quot;running 
rough&quot; when he bought it, but would still cruise at highway speeds.  Since he 
didn't know how to fix the FI he pulled it and tried to install carbs but 
finally lost interest.  It has sat since then.  In case the existing engine 
can't readily be fixed by replacing the FI, I also have a complete used 
engine I bought from another list member on a pallet ready to install.  He 
says it was running great when he pulled it from a totaled vehicle.  I also 
have a box of FI parts, minus the ECU, to go with the engines.  I am planning 
to advertise the whole lot locally for $1,500 but will sell it all to a list 
member for $1,250.  Since a new Carver furnace is at least $700, and a good, 
used engine goes for $500 to $1,000, I think this is an extremely good deal 
for someone.  It's like buying a furnace and an engine and getting a free 
camper.  I'm an hour east of Dallas just off I30 if you want to pick it up 
here, or I will tow it to a shipping terminal in Dallas for $50 extra if you 
want it shipped.

This AdventureWagen is in much too good a condition to part out, and I can't 
abide sending it to a crusher.  I have one camper too many now and too few 
parking spaces, so I hope someone will give it a good home.  Pmail me for 
photos or additional information or call 903-455-3349 in the evenings or on 
the weekend.  Please someone help me keep this one on the road.
