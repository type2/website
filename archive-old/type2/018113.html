         Ah, they were probably just smokin' Jah herb, and only thought that
it was running. Or maybe it was demonic spirits trying to drive them crazy.
Have you ever studied the smoke theory of electricity -- goes something about
the electrons flow thru the pipe (wire) and intermittently there are holes
filled with smoke, etc. Or maybe it's that the smoke is flowing thru the pipe
(wire) and intermittently there are electron paritcles floating along with it
in holes in the smoke and --- whatever, something like that, I can't remember
at the moment.
