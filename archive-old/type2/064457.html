Subject: Re: Starting problem - FI?

I was just trying to get my transplant working &amp; I noticed when the 
fuel pump comes on relative to the Air Flow Control unit function
and how that relates to fuel pressure and pressure regulator 
operation.

The fuel pump is not supposed to run until the AFC unit 
starts to open up.  The little contact on the right side triggers the 
fuel pump relay.  Starting the engine draws enough air through the 
AFC to close that contact, thus providing power to the fuel pump.
The fuel pressure regulator (left lower firewall in my '80, right on 
a '76) will open and send fuel back to the tank after proper fuel 
pressure is reached to keep the FI system under the proper pressure.
I figured this out 'cause my beige '80 AFC trigger is ALWAYS open,
thus whenever the ignition switch is on, the fuel pump runs.
When I first fired up the brown '80 AFC unit the fuel 
pump didn't come on as I expected, thus the inspection, and 
realization that the beige one is improper.

I don't have fuel pressure gauge (yet) so can't verify this, but
when the fuel pump is turned off (ignition switch) the pressure 
regulator immediately bleeds pressure off the FI system.  I say this 
from an engineering aspect that one doesn't want fuel under pressure 
unless it is to be actually used.  TOO DANGEROUS to do otherwise.
Knowledgeable reality check to be inserted here, please.

Think about it: fuel under pressure + hot engine compartment + leak 
= Flames

&gt; I was recently contemplating this same problem, and I was thinking
&gt; about the fuel pump and/or fuel pressure regulator.  The main fuel
&gt; ring is supposed to stay pressurized while the car is off, right?
&gt; But presumably it would leak down over time (how long?  hours?  a
&gt; week?  a month?).  If the pump or pressure regulator is getting
&gt; weak, could that be a cause of long-cranking starts, i.e., takes
&gt; the fuel ring a while to get up to pressure?
