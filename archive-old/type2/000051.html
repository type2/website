Subject: fan pulley hub
Message-ID: &lt;0.4fccf16.255b6ac5_at_aol_dot_com&gt;

    Greetings listees, I disassembled the case before removing my fan pulley 
hub.  I have been unsuccessfully attempting Muir's method of tapping round 
and round.  With a block of wood as a dampener, I have hit it hard enough 
with a hammer, to totally gouge and splinter the wood.  I would use a three 
armed harmonic puller, as Tom Wilson directs, but I don't have one.  Does 
anyone know other methods? Can I use heat?  As always, any help would be 
appreciated.  Thanks, Pete
