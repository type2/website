Hello listees! 
I know you get alot of these, but I really need help.
My camper van started to hesitate, and I thought it might be a vacuum leak. 
it wasn't.
So I took it to the Bughaus, and they soaked me for 470 denero, and it is 
still acting goofy. They replaced the fuel pump, fuel regulator, head cyl 
temp sensor, and six hours of labor. but it still goes kachug, kachug. They 
say it is not the ECU, or any of the other sensors. They also ruled out the 
air flow meter. I seem to think it is something with the exhaust system. It 
smokes from the oil burning off on the exhaust, because it is really hot. the 
engine remains cool. so cool I can touch the block. Am I crazy to think that 
a clogged exhaust system can cause these symptoms? Please help, and I will be 
glad to correspond with anyone one on one if they can help.
Thank you,
'78 Westy &quot;blue&quot;, and her human, Matt Santori
