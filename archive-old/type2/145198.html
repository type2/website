&gt; Late Mexican busses had a water cooled inline 4 (Rabbit/Golf style)

Brazil was indeed using the type 1 engine.  Mexico was using the water
cooled bus.  I believe that, for quite a while, both the Brasilian and
Mexican variations were built in Brasil.  The Mexican watercooled
configuration was discontinued when Mexico switched to the Sharan.  It
doesn't take much of a stretch to imagine VW do Brasil building
watercooled T2 buses for their domestic market.

The prospect of someone assembling a watercooled &quot;kit&quot; is intriguing, but
the question is how far the kit would go.  IIRC, the watercooled buses had
a modified nose section to accommodate the radiator, something a converter
would probably not want to attempt.
