Subject: '79 Bus for sale in Renton, Washington
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

I purchased a '79 bus a year ago when I first got into VW's and have since
learned that I made a mistake.  It had all the FI removed and a (obviously
not VW) progressive carb.  Wouldn't pass emissions and well, I've been a lot
happier working on my Type1 engine and would rather just pass this bus along
to someone who knows Type IV and/or wants to deal with the progressive carb.

Asking $950 -- which is what we paid for.  Engine is STRONG with 125+
compression all around.

Needs some work: e-brake isn't working, not sure why (haven't done much work
on this bus since I couldn't get the emissions passed).  Rear bumper
missing.  Few surface rust spots that need cleaned and painted.

I will get some photos of the engine / carb and other bits this weekend.  If
you want photos of a given area, please let me know.

P.S.  I am still seeking a 1967 or earlier Double Cab bus.  Good body is
what I'm after, budget is under $3000.  Willing to consider missing or
non-working engine... just best possible body!
