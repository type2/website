&gt;&gt;&quot;The BN2 model gas heater is a 12 volt system. It mounted on the drivers'
&gt;&gt;side of the car (bug/ghia), and is turned on by a lever in the passenger
&gt;&gt;compartment (near the hood release). When the lever is pulled, the gas
&gt;&gt;heater is turned on. The gas heater uses a low volume, low pressure electric
&gt;&gt;fuel pump to deliver the fuel from the car's gas tank to a jet in the gas
&gt;&gt;heater, which restricts how much fuel is delivered to the combustion
&gt;&gt;chamber. Any excess fuel is rerouted to the car's gas tank.

&gt;This describes a B 2 heater, not a BN 2.  Both are also available in 6 volt.

Whoops, my mistake &lt;face red with shame&gt;. The heaters I have ARE the B 2
model. My apologies.

&gt;The ignition
&gt;&gt;source is a 12 volt glow plug. 
&gt;
&gt;actually, it is  4 volt.  It is hooked up to a series resistance.

I stand corrected. 

&gt;&gt;heat), and blown into the car - it is a recirculating heater.
&gt;
&gt;Most are non-recirculating. I think (but can't yet prove) that '70 was the
&gt;only year for a recirculating B 2.

Actually, to make a B 2 recirculating, you just need the plastic ductwork,
and another hole below the dash. I prefer using the recirculating heater, as
it does not blow cold air into the car when it isn't being used. The flap
that blocks the air when the heater is turned off doesn't work very well.
The 2 B 2's I have came out of a '68 and a '71 bug.

&gt;&gt;airports), as you can gas yourself if the gas heaters combustion chamber is
&gt;&gt;cracked or rusted
&gt; 
&gt;Not with an Eberspacher.  Not only are the heat exchangers stainless steel,
&gt;but &quot;Since the static pressure on the fresh air side is higher than on the
&gt;gas mixture side, exhaust gas cannot blend with the fresh air, even if the
&gt;heat exchanger is not hermetic, and any danger that such gasses may enter
&gt;the passenger cabin is excluded.&quot;  This is quoted from a B 2 manual and is
&gt;true for all Eberspachers.

Wow, I didn't know this before. It does make sense though. Now I know why
Eberspacher heaters are so expensive. 

Thanks for the corrections.
