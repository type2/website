Subject: Re: [T2] Master cylinder for clutch

Don't look for it too long...'cause there isn't one. There is a cable
though, maybe that needs adjustment. Get yourself a Bentley VW service
manual...it's a must have.

good luck,

Joey

&gt; Newbie here again - if it isn't one thing, it is another.  The brakes are
ok
&gt; now, but I can't seem to find the master cylinder for the clutch on a
'68 -
&gt; as it needs fluid.  The stick slips into gear nicely when the engine is
off,
&gt; but will not move when the engine is on - this happens with my Ranger at
&gt; times, and I just add dot 3 fluid to the slave cylinder.  Can't find that
&gt; either on the '68.
&gt;
&gt; Thanks in advance
&gt;
&gt; Susan
