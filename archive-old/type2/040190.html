&gt; From: Adam Rechs &lt;ajrechs_at_jps_dot_net&gt;
&gt; 
&gt; 	Thanks for all the info on my dragging brake pads.  From what I
&gt; have gleaned from all your responses is that the dragging I have is a
&gt; little more than normal.

--&gt; I'm curious what's normal for this.  My pads drag a bit -- I can
turn the wheel with one hand on the tire, but it's not so free I can
give it a good spin and have it turn a revolution or two.  Is this normal?
I always figured disc brakes should have some resistance, since they have
no return springs.  The front brakes don't get noticably warm on long
highway runs.  Should I be concerned, or not?
