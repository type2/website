&gt; Has anyone found a good way to clean this without removing it, or removed
&gt; it and replaced it with something else? I assume it's there to absorb
&gt; condensation to a certain extent, so it doesn't drip on you.

I had the same mildewing effect a year ago and I painted it with fiberglass
paint.  Not a good idea.  Now, when you sleep upstairs, the condensation
from your breath isn't absorbed by the fuzzy stuff and may drip on the bed.
This is gross.  Also, if you happen to bump bare skin on the roof it will
hurt, often times breaking through the skin.  nough said.
