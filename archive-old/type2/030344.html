Volks,

Did you know that you can drive with a broken clutch cable?  Not forever,
and not at all conveniently, but if your clutch cable breaks, you don't
*need* to call a tow truck.

You need the clutch to allow the transmission input shaft (and eventually
the road wheels) to turn at a different RPM than the engine.  If they are
turning at the same rate, then the trans will slip out of or into gear
very smoothly.  Note that *none* of the following should be tried in
traffic (at least not the first time :-)

Stage 1. Next time you are out cruising, get into 4th at about 50 and ease
off the gas until the engine is neither pushing or dragging.  Push the
gear shift towards neutral.  Slid into neutral pretty easy, yes? If it
didn't slide easy, then try giveing it a bit more or less gas, until the
speeds of the engine and trans are matched.

Stage 2. With the shift in neutral at about 50 mph, try matching engine
RPM, by ear, to the speed of the car and pull the shift back down toward
4th.  If you are smack on, it will slide in just as easy as it slid out.  
If you are close, it will grind, and if you are way off, the interlock
will keep it from going (or at least *should*).  Practice matching the RMP
to the speed until you can shift into and out of 4th w/o the clutch.

Stage 3. Accellerate to ~45-50 in third, ease off the gas and push the
shift into neutral, just like you did with 4th in stage 1. As the engine
slows, push it into 4th as in stage 2.  If at first you miss, play on the
gas 'till the RPM's match.

Stage 4. After you can get into and out of 4th with ease, get up to ~50,
slide into neutral, and let the speed drift back to ~40-45.  Raise the
engine RPM until it sounds right for that speed in third, then try
sliding the shifter forward in to third.  This is a bit trickier, at least
for me.  I can distinguish RPM better at the lower RPM ranges, for some
reason, but can do this if I concentrate.

Practice now can make you much more confident if you gotta at some point
down the road.  The two problems are that you can't do this from a stop.
You have to stop the engine, shift into first, and start the engine with
the car in gear.  Tricky to say the least.  Also, I find this a difficult
technique because I am usually cursing myself *so* hard for leaving the
spare clutch cable in the basement! and it's hard to concentrate when
you are cursing like that :-)

In theory, there is no difference between theory and practice.
But, in practice, there is.
