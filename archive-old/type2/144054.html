Subject: does it matter if the fuel filter is before the fuel pump?

Hello all, 
 
I got the tank out on my 81 Vanagon and am waiting to have it cleaned.  Question - I see in the books the fuel filter is supposed to come before the fuel pump.  However, the prior owner switched them in my vehicle - the pump is before the filter.  Should I change them?
 
Thanks - 
 
Marc
