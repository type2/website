Does anyone have and opinion of SalemVWs in Salem, VA? I am planning on
having a great deal of work done there. Mark Dearing seems to know what he
is talking about and has been building engines for a long time. Anyone heard
anything good or bad about his work or business practices? At this point I
have a great deal of confidence in him but as they say&quot;An ounce of
prevention is worth a pound of cure&quot;. Thanks in advance for any help. TBear
