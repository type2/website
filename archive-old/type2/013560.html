Heya Charlie,
That might be a better idea than I-5.  Only downside is that we're going
after I get off work, so it'll be dark most of the way.  Right now I'm
thinking 101S to 152 to I-5.  Maybe on the drive back I can talk the
wife into going PCH.  
Cooling has been good so far.  I have no gauges (yet) so I can't be 100%
sure.  I think I might have to invest in a couple of gauges...


Thanks,

Simon Ramirez Jr.

&gt; Speedy from blowing into the other lane of traffic.
&gt; 
&gt; I would say if the bus is cooling right you should be fine.
