Subject: Re: [T2] Crane XR700 location

hey Guys   I have most of mine mounted on the left side on the  inner part of 
the wheel well.Be sure to mount it so that you can see the led  lite. makes 
it easier when trouble shooting.  I had a guy call me broke  down and he was 
able to see the lite so I knew the unit had current. turned out  it was his 
coil.  later  Mark dearing
