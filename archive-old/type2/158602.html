&gt; With the performance improvements you're planning I think you'd be 
&gt; putting yourself at risk from the suspension if you make the brakes 
&gt; any better.

It's a truck, fer crissakes...Yes, I'd like more power pulling a hill, but
that suspension was designed 50 years ago...It's never gonna be up
to modern speeds and handling. It's simple physics; you've got a top
and tail heavy box... Push the envelope and you're gonna be watchin'
the sky in your rear view mirror... ;-(
