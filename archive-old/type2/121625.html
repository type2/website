If I were you, I would tune for 12.5 at WOT, 14.7 at cruise and 
decel.  Maybe a bit leaner at decel.  That will give you a pretty good 
compromise for power, emissions and engine life.

&gt;Does anyone know what air/fuel ratio a *stock* VW bus engine (2.0 liter,

&gt;looking for people that have done dyno tests and have some numbers.
