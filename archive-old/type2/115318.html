Subject: busdepot's IP address

Hi.

My system is balking at www.busdepot_dot_com

I think it is some resolver that ain't resolving.

Can someone please ping www.busdepot_dot_com and let me know their  IP address.

Thanks

RBC - I want to find a Vanagon part that was referenced earlier today.  
Can't sleep without seeing a picture of the part.
