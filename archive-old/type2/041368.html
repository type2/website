Subject: 71 Camper articles (was sagging rear)

OK, I ventured down to my basement and found my old collection of H*tVWs
from my salad days. The articles were published in 89-90 and it was a 71
Westfalia. Being H*tVWs some articles will be useful to everyone and some
will be useful to people that have nothing they can think of to do to their
bus (like drill their drums and rotors for better brake performance). I
received a number of requests for the sagging bum article and requests for
all articles. I also found several Type4 engine articles I thought were
good as well (that's what I tell my wife, I read them for the articles, not
the bikini pictures :-)).

So in light of the volume of material and the number of requests I have
decided to post the articles on a website, maybe mine maybe a freebie site.
Probably I will have links on my site that point to content on freebie
sites. Ideally I want to post text and pictures, not just big scans of the
pages as the one page I scanned last night was quite large in file size. I
have OCR software around somewhere that i need to re-install etc etc.

So in any case the hottest demand is the sagging bum article (also includes
rear sway bar installation) which I will strive to post to a website
sometime this weekend. Other good ones that I consider a higher priority
are replacing the tent, adjusting the sliding door, and extra gauge
installation. Of course, if the long arm of the H*tVWs legal staff tracks
me down with a cease and desist letter I will comply promptly so I wouldn't
bother linking to the posted info. I will post any new links here.

Remember, patience is a virtue!
