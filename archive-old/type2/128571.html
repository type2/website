Subject: Re: [T2] Re: POR 15 Corrosion Control Process

Bring a case of Captain Morgan--and I'm on the job--

Can't say how bizarre the paint jobs will be--

You guys like Flames and Scallops?

How bout some Pearl Flip-Flop jobs?

Yea baby---cosmic Buses--:&gt;)

No guarantee's on the paint if I have to blow over POR 87--
LOL--!! 

 
&lt;Ive got the solution to make everyone happy. Since terry is a
professional and hates paint jobs done wrong... He can derust and paint
everybodys bus and well never use a drop of por again. of course he
would volunteer his services because he cares so strongly about it....:) 
show of hands?&gt;
