Subject: Bad phone day tomorrow

Because we will be unloading a large container load of parts arriving from
Europe tomorrow, there will be fewer than usual people handling the phones.
At times you may get no answer, or be put on hold longer than usual.  Please
be patient, or better yet, call on Friday.  My apologies for the
inconvenience.  Of course the website remains in full operation with no
delays.
Thanks,
