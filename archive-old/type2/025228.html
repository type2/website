Subject: Jaw Drop, Beetlemex heat exchangers

My heart has almost stopped!

I saw that Beetlemex was selling assembled (turn key) engines for $1699,
only $720 more than they want for just the longblock.  However, shipping
would spoil this deal for me (no way UPS would ship that, and trucking
company would up cost to most likely around $250 to ship it).

Beetlemex has dealerships in Mexico, they are direct importers.  Given that
Beetlemex is selling engines for $980 when everyone else is $1299 or maybe
$1200... I thought I'd ask.  How much is an Alternator ($198!, high).  What
about your heat exchangers, are these VW Mexico or Dansk -- and how much?

The answer: VW Mexico, and they are $31.50 each.

OH my gawd!  Does anyone know anything about these pups?  Here is a photo of
the assembled longblock, with these Heat Exchangers on them (not a great
photo, but at least I know we aren't talking J-Tubes):

So has anyone ever had a set of the VW Mexico heat exchangers?  How do they
compare to German / Dansk regular / Dansk Heavy Duty?

I've already ordered a set, but I wanted to see if anyone had run into these
before!
