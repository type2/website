Subject: Re: Double Cab Snorkel?

Cool! was my first reaction.  Sounds like you have the plumbing 
started to do a recirculation of cab air back to engine compartment and 
re-heated forward to cab!  Snorkel sounds reasonable, if there were 
additional seals, covers, etc to seal out the more normal entry 
locations for air into the engine compartment.  Wouldn't need to be 
concerned about sealing cylinder air cooling, THEN YOU HAVE A WATER 
COOLED ENGINE, but you still need air for carb intake.   Is there a
separate inside engine compartment snorkel for carburetor? or 
evidence of one?  like unexplained holes, screws, fittings, brackets?
Any other *different* stuff there that may seal out water from generator, 
distributor, etc?  Different air filter holder with aditional intake 
for snorkel and float valve to shut off air from engine compartment?
Please excuse my rantings, this is just way too nifty!  Never seen 
one, never heard of one, just random speculations.  Curses on that 
engineering side of my personality! Oh well . . . .

&gt; During the course of our conversation, Bill pointed out a unique feature 
&gt; on my '76 double cab. In the right rear corner of the passenger cab (on 
&gt; the exterior) is a small vent that goes down into the interior of the 
&gt; cab. It then makes a couple of right hand turns through a plastic part, 
&gt; and then the passageway goes through one of the frame rails all the way 
&gt; back to the engine compartment.
&gt; 
&gt; Now, given that this is allegedly a former West German army vehicle, Bill 
&gt; and I surmised that it must be a snorkel for the engine while fording 
&gt; through a stream.
&gt; 
&gt; Anyone have any ideas on this? Ever seen it on other late model double 
&gt; cabs? I'd love to find out more information on this.
