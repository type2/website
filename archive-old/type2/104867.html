Subject: Re: [T2] Low vacuum in rebuilt engine

This seems kinda funny on the valve adjustment, I
build and sell engines all the time, T-1,2,3,4. All of
my engines come out of my shop as long blocks, dist
shaft dropped for what it is being installed in,
valves adjusted (mec or hyd)Oil filter to. the only
thing needed is all accesories, tin and oil. Your
engine should have came to you the same way with the
valves adjusted. I don't know of many people left that
sells short blocks. Phil
