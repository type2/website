&gt; Anybody used AVP for a rebuilt engine, good bad etc. looking for a
longblock
&gt; 2.0l

When I bought my 74 Riviera, the PO thoughtfully included a still in the
crate AVP 1.8 long block. As luck would have it I had to install it a few
short months later.

I am now approaching 30,000 miles on this engine and I have no complaints
whatsoever. It runs strong, doesn't leak a drop of oil from anywhere,
doesn't burn any oil either. ( I have yet to add any between changes.) I
live in Kentuky and have driven this bus to Florida, to Michigan, and points
in between. It's also my daily driver and never fails to start in any kind
of weather.

This has been my experience, YMMV.

Regards,
Dave
