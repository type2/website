Subject: re: first time buying a bus. 

Great reply from west coast loafer. I'll try to build on that.

If I were totally new to buses, I would try to find a type 2 mechanic to 
inspect the bus before money changed hands. And I'd look at the type2_dot_com 
Library.

Inspection might cost $100.....balanced against $5k or more in potential 
repairs/replacements. Better to know. And if you can't find an experienced 
VW bus mechanic to inspect it, you are already in a very vulnerable 
position with regard to owning the bus....not unlike most of us who already 
have them.

AND, I'd look at the advice on the type2_dot_com web site. At left on web page 
click on LIBRARY. When Technical library page opens, scroll down to BUYING 
A BUS and click on it. When this page opens up, select USED BUS BUYERS 
GUIDE by Copely and Ovenell. It is an incredibly long and detailed check 
list, and will give you some idea of the complexity of the task of 
evaluating a used bus. Because it is so overwhelming, I suggest paying an 
expert for help, if you can find one.

Without an inspection, and risking a controversial wild guess, have in mind 
about $5k to restore potential mechanicals (brakes, steering/front beam, 
fuel system, exhaust, tires, electricals, clutch/shifters, transmission, 
engine, etc) to safe operation and then deal with cosmetic issues on 
another budget.

The vehicle is over 25 years old and probably has already had multiple 
repairs and replacements by multiple owners, and it would be unusual to 
expect all of them to add up to a stock condition.

 &gt; Help Needed,
 &gt;
 &gt; I'm going to look at a 78 Champagne Edition II micro soon, to
 &gt; purchase. This will be my first bus. Does anyone have any useful
 &gt; information to check out on the bus or any info online. There is not
 &gt; a lot out there on these. Thanks
 &gt;
