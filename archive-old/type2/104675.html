Subject: Re: [T2] Curtain/Interior questions for 79' Westy

Hi Jared,

Curtains for my westfakia took 10 yards of fabric, including the front 
window. Upholstery ran about the same amount, but my westfakia has a 
modified 73 westy interior that's quite different from a 79 westy.

Happy trails,

&gt; someone has I could look at? Thanks in advance.
