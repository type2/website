&gt;My 300 mile engine is running too hot I fear. On the hills 240+ (I stop and
&gt;cool down at 240). I received an e-mail last night that recommended I=

&gt;the timing a bit to run cooler. I time it at 28 degrees max advance. Vac
&gt;advance distributor.
&gt;
&gt;Then today I found this in the archives:
&gt;
&gt;&lt;&lt;&lt;The biggest problem I find with VW's is the use of a timing light to set
&gt;the timing of a non-stock engine. On a weekly basis I have VW's coming in
&gt;the shop complaining about heat and/or running problems, after I look at it
&gt;the first thing I do is advance the timing a few degrees and that usually
&gt;solves the problem. Most non stock VW engines that I see are running to
&gt;retarded, which in turn causes them to run hot. The only time I use a=
 timing
&gt;light is to check the timing after I have set it by ear, so I know where to
&gt;set it if I need to make changes to something and to check the advance if
&gt;the dizzy. Using a timing light to set the timing on a NON STOCK engine is=
 a
&gt;NO NO, but to each there own. &gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt;What is the answer?

Hear any pinking at all??? No?? Still could be too high compression from=20
not verifying deck height during assembly. Could also be just running too=20
lean. How did you adjust the mixture??? Float level too low will lean you=20
out =3D heat. So would a vacuum leak. A weak fuel pump that can't keep up=20
will likewise drop the fuel level in the carb and lean you out =3D heat.

&gt;Another subject: There definitely is a rpm dependant vibration in the=
 beast.
&gt;Pisses me off as I spent a lot of money having the whole thing balanced
&gt;before I assembled it. How long till this engine flies apart?


A few possibles: fouled plug, cracked plug insulator, bad HT wire, cracked=
=20
dizzy cap, valve lash closing up, cylinder studs=20
cracked/stretching/pulling, piston installed 180=B0 wrong, head seal going=
=20
south due to unparallel machining of either the case or head or mismatched=
=20
cylinder shims. cracked or burned valve or piston or head from overheating.

Check and proof the ignition first, then the fuel system. If that's all=20
good, teardown is probably required to find the problem.

Note if it ran smoothly for 200 miles then developed the vibration, it's=20
not a problem with the balancing work. If it was out of balance initially=20
it would have vibrated from initial startup.
