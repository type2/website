Plugged as in the end of the honeycomb is melted? I have seen overrich
running engines do this. [bad cylinder head temp sensor] No, there is no
fix....the cat is junk. The one on my daughters bus looked perfect.....just
was dead.


&gt; Karl:
&gt; I've got a used one I'm planning to put on someday. I noticed it's about
50%
&gt; plugged. I wonder if a person could just clean out the end? It looks like
most
&gt; of the plugging is just built up on the inlet end. I'd think a blast with
a sand
&gt; blaster would clean off the deposits and open it back up. Ever hear of
anyone
&gt; doing that?

&gt; &gt; It passed with no problem. I have no explaination on why the HC went up,
but
&gt; &gt; it was still below the max allowable. This should fix you Vanagon also.
$125
&gt; &gt; well spent.......
