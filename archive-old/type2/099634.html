Hello all,
I am starting to plan a trip for next summer to do a 2nd honeymoon. We want
to drive from Charlotte NC to SO Cal, and back. Anyone have ideas for routes
and things to see on the way??
Should I go low through the Desert or high through the Plains?
any ideas would be great.
Thanks- Bryan

Both.....Go out one way, back the other way. Don't do the desert route in 
the summer without excellent air conditioning. It might kill you.  See what 
is there and what appears interesting to you and what is blessed by good 
weather while you are in the vicinity. What is really important will be 
impossible to avoid.......like the Rocky Mountains and the Pacific Ocean 
and LA. Take in Disneyland and Las Vegas and the Grand Canyon.

In Arizona  http://www.americansouthwest_dot_net/arizona/index.shtml  with your 
air conditioning running full blast see  LAKE MEAD National Recreation Area 
- scenic desert region centered around a large lake on the Colorado River.
ORGAN PIPE CACTUS National Monument - rocky desert around the Mexican 
border, with rare cacti
PETRIFIED FOREST National Park - brilliantly coloured fossilised logs
SAGUARO National Park - large forests of saguaro cactus, the state symbol 
of Arizona
SUNSET CRATER VOLCANO National Monument - colourful volcanos and cinder 
cones with extensive lava flow


In California  http://www.americansouthwest_dot_net/california/index.shtml     see:
MOJAVE National Preserve - more excellent desert scenery REDWOOD National 
and State Parks - dense coastal redwood forests SEQUOIA National Park - 
huge trees, cliffs and mountains YOSEMITE National Park - glaciated peaks 
and valleys of great beauty.

At some point, swoop up into northwestern 
Montana  http://www.nps_dot_gov/glac/  and stay awhile in Glacier National Park.

Curl down into Wyoming and over into 
Utah  http://www.americansouthwest_dot_net/utah/index.shtml  for the canyon lands.

Spend a month in Colorado 
http://www.americansouthwest_dot_net/colorado/index.shtml     seeing 
everything, including Colorado National Monument in the high plateau 
country near Fruita. Very few people go there because they think it is a 
statue (monument)or something, but it is a monument to the high plateau 
country and is a vast park IN the high plateau, just incredible.

Look at all the Colorado park opportunities. See Mesa Verde.  Stay in 
Silverton and Durango and get down into New Mexico 
http://www.americansouthwest_dot_net/new_mexico/index.shtml  and explore the 
ancient civilization dwellings in the cliffs. Visit Taos.

We spent the whole summer out there years ago. But get there in an air 
conditioned vehicle in the summer, or prepare to wear wet towels on your 
head to stay alive in the baking heat of the southwest.
