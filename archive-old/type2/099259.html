Terry and others,

I've learned from a friend who lost out even after going to the mat with 
an insurance company over a cherry car that got totaled and the company 
would not give the real value - only
'replacement&quot; value despite the full coverage.  He bought a '90 Land 
Cruiser for 17K.  It was in great shape and he kept it that way.  It got 
totaled 1 year later (not his fault) and the company offered 10.5K. 
 They fought and settled for 14.3K

He suggested and I got for my bus a &quot;stated value&quot; policy.  It, simply, 
a pre agreed upon value of the bus policy that I pay the premium and 
they pay the value if it gets totaled.  I took pictures and had the bus 
appraised.  I only wanted to get my money out of it if it was totaled. 
 That is 5.5K.  The company agreed and now I am covered.

Check with your insurance company.  My bus is a '79 and did not qualify 
as  an antique or classic or whatever it needed to be to get the full 
replacement coverage.

&gt;You most certainly didn't play you insurance company--or who ever's
&gt;right---
&gt;
&gt;You have the right in event of such a loss to demand an exact same,
&gt;type, condition replacement vehicle in leu of accepting a ridiculous buy
&gt;out --which I see that you didn't---or at least you didn't mention that
&gt;you did---Oops !!
&gt;
&gt;Forget the book--if you didn't have the vehicle in question insured
&gt;correctly--as a collectors and or antique vehicle--which it was, you
&gt;goofed.
&gt;
&gt;Later
