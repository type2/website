Subject: Re: [T2] The old no title havin' blues 

&gt;&gt;The &quot;legit&quot; process here requires an insurance bond
 and many, many days.  Please help me.&lt;&lt;

Eric (&amp; list),

i don't know if there is a way around this issue here in NC.

the law is the law.

in NC the person who wishes to
obtain a title for a vehicle is required to put up a bond for
at least the amount of the value of the vehicle.
 i am not 100% sure, but i
think this is done to prevent stolen vehicles from being
titled. the problem for the individual is that if during a
record search for the vehicle in question, if it comes back
stolen or similar circumstance, you could lose the bond.

the only reason i know this info is b/c about 3 years ago
i went through a similar situation. some lady here at my work
was selling an absolute beauty of a bus - but when her son
purchased the vehicle he never got a title. she wanted
peanuts for it - heck, i even offered her more than she
was asking, as long as it came with a title. she wasn't willing
to put up the bond &amp; neither was i, so i had to walk away.

i still drool at the thought of that bus. it was really nice.

good luck Eric, &amp; if you do indeed find a way around this
situation please let me know! it might be helpful for
future reference.
