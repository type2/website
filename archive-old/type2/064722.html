Gregor,
This is a good idea.  On my '78, the blower doesn't come on until the
lever is ALL THE WAY down, rather than 2/3 of the way.  This makes it
convenient for me on the highway, I can bump the lever up a smidgen and
the blower goes off but the flaps are still effectively all the way
open, keeping me nice and warm.  The blower's noise doesn't bother me
(can't hear it on the highway anyway) but I definitely want it to last
as long as possible, I've heard it's pricey.  

Good thinking with the switch.  What I need to do is get a new cable for
the other heat lever, the one that controls the opening of the vents.
This lever is attached to two cables, one that does the switching
between defroster and fron foot vents and one that opens or closes the
back vents.  The cable that does the back vents has snapped at the lever
and should be replaced.  The question is:  how hard is it?  The box it
connects to under the car is presently coat-hanger fixed so that it is
letting heat in all the time the heat is on, which is nice for back seat
folks but cuts down on defroster efficiency.  Has anybody done this
cable replacement?  Let me know.

Sean
