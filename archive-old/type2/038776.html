&gt;      This evening as I was listening to my bus idle and
&gt; noticed a noise, slight even ticking, which seems to have
&gt; crept up unnoticed untill today. On pulling spark plug
&gt; cables, I noticed that when #3 was pulled there was no
&gt; noticeable change in RPMs while when the others were pulled
&gt; there was a considerable drop.
&gt; I also
&gt; noticed that when I reved the engine, it sounds like it was
&gt; missing. Should I replace the cables?

First thing I'd do is make sure the #3 plug is sparking.  Remove the
plug, reattach the cable, then ground it to a handy part of the engine
(with your hand insulated from the plug!) while someone cranks/idles the
engine.  That'll at least tell you whether your problem is spark or fule
related.

&gt; Question #2
&gt;      When it rains, I get water on the floor under the dash.
&gt; Is my windshield seal or the front air vents  leaking?

Almost certainly the windshield.  Many later T2s have this problem,
usually due to a bad seal and/or rust around the bottom of the
windshield.  The immediate concern (other than the wet floor) is that
the water often gets into the headlight and turn signal relays, which
are mounted upside down behind the steering column.  Over time the
problem gets worse as the rust spreads.  As a cheap fix, you could try
laying down silicon sealant along both edges of the original seal.
Ultimately, though, you'll probably need to replace the seal and deal
with any rust underneath it.

Cheers,
Alistair
