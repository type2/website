instead?  Aside from the occasional dying, 
 could this really foul something else up?  Thanks a
bunch for any advice.&lt;&lt;

First of all, the only &quot;special&quot; tool required to
change a fuel pump on a 69 is a 13mm wrench. It really
is as easy as: un-screwing 4 nuts, pull off old pump,
grease &amp; slide on new pump, re-tighten 4 nuts. New
pump can be gotten for less than $40 from many
vendors. Should be about a 15 minute job! 
Second of all, DO NOT DRIVE THE BUS ANYWHERE if there
is gasoline leaking from the fuel pump. Smell the
stuff leaking. Is it gas??  BUS GO BOOM!!!
Its a very easy job and considering you are looking at
paying a tow truck, a mechanic, and for the part, I
encourage you to try to do it on your own.
