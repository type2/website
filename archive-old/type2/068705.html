Subject: '66 progress, rebuilt spindles installed

Hi all,

I got my rebuilt king-pins installed and thought I'd post about my
experience. (1966 standard microbus)

In general, removing the spindles is quite easy.  When I got mine off
I found that a couple of the link-pins and their needle-bearing races
were pitted so I decided to put in new link-pins, needle-bearings, and
races.  I ordered these from Wolfsburg West for about $110.  While I was
talking to the WW guy he told me that the rebuilt king-pin spindles from
places like Wolfgang International (where I got mine) are rebuilt by
turning the king-pin down to a slightly smaller diameter and using oversized
bushings.

Wolfsburg West currently has king-pin rebuild kits with new king-pins,
bushings, etc. for sale.  The price is around $360 and then you still have
to have someone do the labor.  Since the rebuilt spindles from Wolfgang
cost me $199 the cost difference is significant.

The new link-pins and related hardware arrived quickly as has always been
my experience when ordering from Wolfsburg West.  The main difference I
noticed from the old hardware is that the needle-bearing cages that came with
the new link-pins are made out of nylon rather than the old, steel, ones.
(I don't think this should make much difference in the longevity of the
link-pins as long as the bearing races, needle-bearings and the pins themselves
are made from good steel.)

I took the rebuilt spindles and link-pin hardware down to a local auto-machine
shop and they charged me $25 to press in the bearing races.

Yesterday, after having a bad cold all week, I finally felt good enough to
go out and do the spindle install.  This also was easy and straight forward.
The only additional parts I needed were new lock washers for the wheel
bearing lock nuts, 23 cents each at the local VW parts place. I did notice
a barely perceptible amount of play in the lower king-pin bushing on the
drivers side that shouldn't be there.  This is much less play than the old
worn king-pins but more than a properly reamed king-pin should have (I think).
Also, a couple of the grease fittings are very difficult to get any grease into.
This makes me think that the king-pin bushings may be installed somewhat
sloppily.

I took it down to Sears and had them align the front end.  The Camber was
dead-on spec. so I guess I got the correct number of shims on each end of the
four link pins.  The Toe-in was a little off, easily adjusted with the tie-rod
ends.  The Castor is a little off, not much, and it has to stay that was as
there is no adjustment for Castor.  (their computer didn't have the alignment
numbers for a 1966 VW bus but I took my Bentley manual with me and we put the
number in by hand. (alignment cost $40 with 6-month guarantee)

Well, the old bus doesn't drive much different for all of that but I feel
better and the bus's karma is improved (and the tires should wear better).
