Subject: farting, missing but compression okay
Message-ID: &lt;Pine.SOL.3.91.990504140814.913A-100000_at_watson.bcm.tmc_dot_edu&gt;

	Hey, gang. I've got a 1974 with stock 1800, dual solexes that has
a farting problem. It farts or pops on deceleration, and pulling the
cables on cylinders 1 and/or 2 doesn't do much, that is, the engine
doesn't get nearly as mad as when you pull 3 or 4. The compression's okay
(~130 all around, except #3, which is 160, yes, one sixty), and I noticed
that my two-month-old spark plugs got crazy carbon fouled in less than two
months. Valves are dead-on, although #2 got suspiciously tight over three
months or so. Points are kosher, so is timing, so are cables and their
locations. Fuel economy is hurtin'. I am beginning to suspect the carbs,
but don't really know where to start. Ideas? The engine's fairly ancient
(130k on it), and I'm worried it's time for something serious. Thanks to
Dave Schwarz for getting me this far, and TIA.
