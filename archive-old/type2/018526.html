Hello all,

        Yes, believe it or not, the title is right. I who know little,
but is learning alot has some &quot;words of wisdom&quot; to any wanna bussers out
there. You will have to excuse the dark cloud hovering over this
message, but you will learn why later.
        When staking your claim to that new shiny bus, here are a few
things to make sure of. 1 NEVER buy from a friend of a friend,
especially sight unseen, they are much harder to yell at, or at least
make demands to. 2 Look, feel, touch, smell every square inch inside and
out, because you never know what can be lurking in the shadows, poised
too attack, and just because it looks good doesn't mean the super glue
won't unstick itself three miles down the road. 3 If it gives you a bad
feeling, there is a reason, find it. 4 Know your local and statewide
laws.
        The reason I post this today, is yesterday, after $850 for a non
running bus, around $1000 in parts, 7 months of fixing in snow, sleet,
rain, and hail and gallons of blood sweat and tears, I was told that she
won't now, and never will pass inspection because of a rusty frame.
PLEASE don't make the same mistake I did.

End of rant,
Nate
