&quot;Steve Trembley&quot; &lt;stevet_at_whidbey_dot_com&gt; worote:
&gt;&gt;The Bentley manual, page 5:16 gives you a shroud front view...not really 
&gt;&gt;clear to someone who's never installed the system tho.  Perhaps a dealer 
&gt;&gt;could photocopy the shroud layout from microfiche? &lt;&lt;

Steve et al, I did a search on a beta engine at google:  images.google_dot_com 
and found &quot;Stephen's misc aircooled VW engine tin pictures&quot; at

http://www.i405_dot_com/VW/Stand/

These are great.  Stephen who?  Thank you for putting this huge page 
together.  This is making my life a LOT easier.  I bet there's a link to 
this from type2_dot_com but it was down when I was searching.

John
