&gt;&gt;so what should I do?  I need real!  heat and possible A/C, as well as as
&gt;many
&gt;&gt;modern conviences as possible.&gt;
&gt;
&gt;If these are the things you need, you do not want a Volkswagen Bus.

Completely agree with Shawn.  If you want modern conveniences, buy something modern (i.e., Winnebago camper or decent FWD minivan).  VW Busses are neither modern, inexpensive, nor convenient.  You need to be aware of that up front or you will be disappointed.
