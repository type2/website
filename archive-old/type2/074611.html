Hi Jim,

Yup, Steve's an ace!

Last year I lost the sole ignition key to my bus, and Steve was able to
promptly supply a pair of replacement keys from the code from the latch on
the rear hatch. IIRC he billed it to my Mastercard and shipped them within
24 hrs.

Happy trails,

&gt; Hello List:
&gt; 
&gt; I just wanted to post a little info concerning one of our fellow list members,
&gt; Steve Sandlin.  We hear from Steve from time to time concerning lock and key
&gt; issues for our busses, and I sent him a whole set of new locks for my 71 Bus
&gt; for him to key-alike.  His turn-around time is fantastic, and he takes the
&gt; time to communicate and follow-up like all service providers should.  He has
&gt; my highest recommendation, and hopefully all list members will be able to do
&gt; business with Steve in the future.
&gt; 
&gt; Since most posts concerning vendors seem to be negative in nature, I think
&gt; it's important to also give praise when it's due.
