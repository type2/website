Hi,
Stand by for great Koolatron story...
I 1998 my girlfriend and I drove to the southernmost tip of South America in a 
1972 Panel. Aside from a broken shock and a fan belt, everything went great 
including the cooler. It was awesome!
Before leaving, I tore out the gas heater and replaced it with something far 
more usefull, another battery! Using a solenoid system, I was able to run the 
cooler until about midnight when you could hear the fan starting to s l o w.
During the day everything was charged back up again and our foods and beverages 
kept cool. If you're able to keep some ice inside, even better. After 7 months 
of pounding and running nearly non-stop daily, the cooler still worked!!
Truly the best money I ever spent!
When I arrived back in Canada I moved it to my more comfortable digs in my PU 
camper where it continued to do it's duty.
Months later I had my truck and camper stolen. Another tale which I won't 
bother you guys with, but even if I did come across it today I'm sure it would 
keep the F_at_#$ers' body parts nice and cool until I could leave them out in the 
forest for the grizzlies!
