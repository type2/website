Subject: Re: [T2] Re: [VB] Upright Alternator Endplay

 Question for the list:
Should a Bosch alternator, particularly the one in an upright engine, have 
any endlplay? I'm pretty sure my 2 alts(one original Beetle, one aftermarket 
with internal regulator) have zero. Is this a sign of poor tolerances in 
current production?
This would mean the fan moving in and out, and the pulley moving in and out. 
It's not supposed to do that AFAIK.

Tom,

It seemed like quite a bit to me (it actually clicks back and forth),
but I thought maybe the lack of a fan hub and pulley had something to
do with it.  I'll take another look at it.

Thanks,
Tristan

&gt; That's interesting- a new alt has end play?
&gt; I'm pretty sure that my 2 alternators have none, but then again, I haven't
&gt; checked lately.
