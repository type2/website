Subject: Re: [T2] CHT  installation

Torry,

Ummm...*only* 165-170F??  Lots of folks in the southern u.s. would think 
that was a great temperature as some of them apparently get up to 
220-250F.

Looks like your temps today are going to be about 84F.

My general rule of thumb here(for hot weather) is ambient temp + about 
100-120 degrees F.  If it is 100F here then I expect to get oil temps 
about 100-120f over that after a hard run at 70mph.

I would always check out my current setup and make it work right before 
installing any sort of aftermarket cooling.  

I have seen a simple valve adjustment lower temps as much as 15-20 
degrees.  On a type 1 stock engine, the addition of a little richer main 
jet and adjusting the valves dropped my temps at least 20F.

Unless I missed something, I really don't think you have a problem.

Cheers, dave

&gt; Hi Dave, Simon and other distinguished experts,
&gt; 
&gt; I  am seriously in need to install a Cyl. Head Temperature sensor &amp; 
reading gauge since my '75 bus' engine gets hot easily, 
up to 165-170 F  (oil sump heat sensor) on a hot sunny day 
in bumper-to-bumper traffic here in Jakarta, 
and I heard  that a CHT is the most accurate temp. 
reading &amp; highly recommended by the experts...  
Therefore I would appreciate it if anyone could 
describe to me a clear step-by-step instruction 
on how to install a CHT sensor &amp; gauge.
&gt; 
&gt; To address that heat problem, I am also thinking about 
installing a second external oil cooler,  would it be a good idea?
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks in advance and I'd love to hear any responses....
