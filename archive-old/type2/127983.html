Subject: Re: Re: [T2] 1700 upgrade to 2000, difficulties

If I could add my 2 cents. I've found that one of the biggest problems in building engines in general is matching up the cyl heads with the correct camshaft. For example, buying a really high-lift cam for top-end performance, and installing it on an engine that has SMALL intake and exhaust ports, would give you an engine that produces very little low-end power, average mid-range power, and absolutely no top-end power.

So of coure, you would want to match up the components, high-lift cam with large free-flowing heads, or long duration cam with a small port cyl head. (I could have these completely backwards and if I do, I apologize!)

Hope that helps some?

I think with the VW, you probably also run into problems with piston size and stroke as well. Then again, this is like the blind giving advice to those that can see. I've never rebuilt a Volkswagen engine, so take my advice for what it's worth!!! :)

&gt; &gt;there is a very good reason that most people end up building a bone stock
&gt; &gt;engine with original spec parts, and that is because the combination has
&gt; &gt;been worked out by someone else. if you mix and match parts like camshafts
&gt; &gt;and heads you will end up with a mongrel beast which may or may not be a
&gt; &gt;tunable, tractable machine.
