X-Diagnostic: MESSAGE MAY NOT BE TOPICAL

I have been following this tread a little, but not completely. The fuel
resrticor that is mentioned, is this the steel part that bolts to the body?
Weren't these made with the unlead only resrictor in other states too? What
I am getting at is this, could I go to a salvage yard here in Wa. and find
this part and send it to a guy in need in Calf.? Our local yards are full of
76-79 Buses and all of them have the fuel filler neck. Last I looked I
thought they had the small opening(could be wrong) I do however know of a 74
that is being parted out that was a Calf. FI Auto Bus, it would have the
right part.

&gt; ...a perfectly good 1979 bus cannot be licensed or driven without this 
&gt; unobtanium part (#119A, not #119).

&gt; My mechanic has a 1979 bus that cannot leave. It is now in bus limbo... 
&gt; His customer is, as you would expect, not at all pleased. If it goes up 
&gt; for sale, I will get a one-day trip permit and move it out 
&gt; of state or scrap it for parts. Seems a darn shame.

What is required is someone with the legally required restrictor who trusts
you enough to loan you theirs to pass the inspection. Or a group of people
who could share a spare one if one can ever be found. A parts-sharing coop.
