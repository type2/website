Gentleperson-
                     Big thanks to whoever wrote to the list about hitting a 
recalcitrant CV bolt with a grinder and beheading it. I'm stripping an
immovable (more rust than frame!), 71 with some rusted away bolts
ready to crank up the vise grips when I remembered the tip about
the grinder.
