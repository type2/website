        Only if you're stupid enough to connect the cables the wrong way.
I've jumped cars of all sorts for 35 years or so any never had a problem.
But some people apparantly can't tell positive from negative -- and it is a
bit hard to see the battery in a bus. Just make sure that *YOU* know which
is which on your battery, and then just make sure that *YOU* and only *YOU*
hooks the cables up. And make sure you can figure out which is which on the
other car too.
