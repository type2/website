Subject: Re:  Over kill and the list Nazi's:

Hello Rik,

    Thank you for reminding me of the rules, I seem to have lost it for a
moment, and had a brain fart. So please forgive my seeming mental breakdown,
I know better, and hopefully another shuttle wont blow up again any time
soon, as I would hate to have another!
    Wait, let me add the ambiguous Type 2 content, I don't want to waste
bandwidth.
    &quot;I once met a Jerk driving a Volkswagen Bus&quot;!

Tommy




&gt; &gt;FORWARDED  from Porsche' list member!!!!!!!!! No comment needed!
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; It is a sad day
&gt;
&gt; A comment on what this has to do with VW buses might be in order.
&gt; This is not a Christian prayer list.  You might try reviewing the list
&gt; guidelines.
&gt;
