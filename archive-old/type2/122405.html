&gt; I am getting ready to start on the restoration of my brake system. I have
&gt; new rear cylinders and pads, new front pads and a new master cylinder and I
&gt; will replace all 4 flex hoses. I have even thought about replacing all the
&gt; steel brake lines availible thru OEVeeDub.

Last time I checked they were out of 71-79 kits and the Cohline factory in
Germany wasn't going to do another run until Feb. This may have changed
since I checked otherwise seek another vendor for this item.

They've accidentally been shipping 68-70 kits out by mistake at least in my
case.

&gt; I haven't messed with brake systems much and I have never replaced a master
&gt; cylinder, rear cylinders or the flex hoses before.  Any tips? I have found
&gt; Steve Dolan's  &quot;procedure&quot; for bleeding in the archives plus some other
&gt; usefull info.

I can't speak for the mc but everything else is a cinch for a first timer.
I highly recommend getting brake bleeder so you can do it quickly and by
yourself. Get the Motive Power Bleeder 0104.

Please post any pmails wrt replacing the mc not mentioned in Bentley. I'd
like to know if it has to be bench bled first.
 
&gt; I would like to flush all the brake fluid too. And it seems like it would be
&gt; best to do this before I install all the new parts, right??? then replace
&gt; with the new parts and bleed as normal? DOT 4 right?

Get Castrol LMA. I flushed more than 32 oz. from my system...

I would flush the system and fill with new fluid, then replace the hardware,
then adjust, then bleed again before adjusting the parking brake at the end.

Most of the junk will come out except for sludge that's built up inside the
calipers and any brake fluid that's solidified in the lines and in the
reservoirs. If you are taking it all apart you can clean everything up
really nicely.
 
&gt; Fianlly, how difficult is it to rebuild the front calipers? Mine don't look
&gt; so great and I noticed BD has a $20 rebuild kit. Any special tools?

The only hard part is removing the pistons. An air gun as mentioned in
Bentley puts out far less force than the hydraulic fluid. If the pistons are
stuck you'll need to use the pedal to remove the pistons which means
probably do the calipers first before you do anything else. You probably
don't need to split the calipers. If you choose to you'll need to locate the
o-rings that go inside because they don't come with the kits.

&gt; What would/did you do?

I'd replace the original boot and seal while you are going all of this work
anyway. Plus, genuine ATE seals are still available and inexpensive. If the
boot isn't torn it's bound to tear eventually and contaminate the caliper.
