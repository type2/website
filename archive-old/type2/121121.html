Subject: Re: [T2] Engine Removal article

Hello,

Thanks a lot for taking the time to photograph your engine removal, 
Richard.  Even though I have a 1970, it was good to see.  When I take  
pics while working on my bus, the camera always ends up covered in grease.

Does anyone know of a similar webpage for an upright engine removal, 
preferrably bus not beetle?  With lots of pics, and helpful hints not 
found in Muir or Haynes? 

Anyone in the Tucson area want to remove my (or your) engine, and do a 
good job photographing it?  Or maybe even video?  Mine could use a good 
clean up, and I need to put in thermostat flaps.  I know where we could 
host the video online for free.

Thanks,
Jon
