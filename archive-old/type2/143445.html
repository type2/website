&gt; I think I'll stick to VWs and Fiats... A Fiat 500 is different, cool, 
&gt; retro... And would lose in a drag race against a Honda Passport 50cc scooter... 
&gt; The Fiat 500 I drove/owned would go 50 mph... A Beetle can still be driven on 
&gt; normal streets and go normal places and still fun to be seen in...
&gt;

to
put new tires on... ;-)
