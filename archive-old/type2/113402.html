Subject: Re: [T2] Still No Spark !

&lt;Grin&gt;

So much for thinking I had her solved eh? It sure would have been an 
easy fix though, just replacing the coil (one easy to reach bolt, 
sweet), no such luck.

It would appear that you (all) are correct (No big surprise, pats on 
the back all round), having run through ALL the tests relating to the 
Points/Condenser/Coil etc in John Muir's book it would appear my 
condenser is hooped, points are not bad. So off I will truck first 
thing tomorrow to acquire myself a new condenser. John recommends doing 
points at the same time, so, being that his word is now law for me...

That's the last time I don't take the advice of this list over my own 
judgment ! At least now I have a spare coil &lt;sigh&gt;. Who knows though, I 
may have an extra condenser/points tomorrow as well.

Being that I have a fair amount of time on my hands these days I will 
have a crack at it myself, any horror stories to share ?

I must admit its an interesting experience, going from tweaking out 
noisy, fast Subaru's to loving my Bus, I'm hooked, no going back now. 
&lt;grin&gt;
I'm really enjoying the community, thank you all for your help,
