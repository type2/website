Subject: Re: Bitch of a job - 2ltr engine install

Hmmm....

Now I've both removed and replaced the fuel tank and removed and
installed the engine on my '81 Vanagon, *and*the*engine*job*is*by*
far*the easier job of the two.  The essence of the engine removal
is:

1) Detach all wires, hoses, etc. which connect engine to the rest
   of the car.
2) Loosen transvers bolt which holds front of trans to chassis.
3) Put jack stand or some other support under rear of trans, leaving
   enough room to allow trans to swing down 3&quot;-4&quot;.
4) Support engine with floor jack.
5) Unbolt engine from trans and chassis.
6) Lower engine (with all tin, etc. intact) and pull from car.

Installation is the reverse.

I agree however that this was even easier on the old busses.  On my old
'64 Bus you didn't have to go through the process of letting the rear of
the trans swing downward, which made installation of the engine so much
easier.  The engine had a straight (level) shot at the trans, not the
forward/upward swing I have to go through now.
