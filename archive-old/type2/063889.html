Subject: Distributorless system

I was wondering if anybody has had any experience with electric
distributors, as in compu-fire or other brands.

- -Are they really mantenaince free?

- -Easy to install?

- -Prices? worth it?

- -Does it solve all distributor problems?

My father is having major problems with his 77 bug now carburated, and I
also would like info on this subject.

I will also promise to go along with any sticker ideas
