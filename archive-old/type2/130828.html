Subject: Re: [T2] A question of conversion

Hi Kurt,

A 2L engine will fit in a 72 bus. Lots of others have chipped in here 
already so I'll limit my comments to stuff I have direct experience 
with.

The 1.7L flywheel will need to be moved to the 2L engine.

If you stay with carbs the 2L engine tin will not have the correct hole 
in it for the throttle cable, so you will need to swap over the 1.7 
front tin. Other tin may or may not have to be moved over as well. You 
will need to rejet the carbs to 135 main jets for the 2L, and you will 
need an electric fuel pump. It would be wise to wire in a relay to shut 
the electric fuel pump off when the engine is not running. An FI 
double-relay can be modified to this purpose or you could design your 
own circuits.

If you have the option to use the 79 FI system, you will need the 
*entire* system, including the fuel pump, harness, decel valve, etc, 
etc. You will need to put a T in the fuel line for the return loop or 
swap out the fuel tank for a 75-79 fuel tank. You will also need to 
fabricate a bracket to support the airbox. FYI, a 12&quot; length of 2x2 
lumber is exactly the right width to fit the channel on the underside 
of the airbox. You will also need to shorten the throttle cable by a 
couple of inches. FI is the preferable way to go but it will require 
more work.

One other thing that hasn't yet been mentioned: Working on an FI system 
without the upper hatch of the 73-79 buses will be a totally immense 
PITA. If it were my bus I would recommend swapping in a 73-79 upper 
access hatch before any further engine conversion was undertaken. (But 
that's just me... It doesn't take much encouragement for me to bring 
out my angle grinder!)


Happy trails,
