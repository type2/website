Hi Volks!

&gt; The recent thread of rear end saggings has lead me to 
&gt; enquire, what is the usual height (ground to a measureable 
&gt; point), of both front and rear suspensions?

&gt;From what I've seen, they vary wildly over years, body styles,
and distance traveled, enough so to make any numeric 
meaningless.  But as a rule of thumb, when seen from the side
with your head in wheel height, the centre of the wheels
(both of them) should be approximately the same height
as the lower edge of the bus' side panels.

Airhowlingly yours,
   Erik.
