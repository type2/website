Hey everybody!

I'm due to pick up the baton in a few hours and  I STILL haven't heard from 
anybody downstream.  Will someone please e-mail me and let me know how I can 
reach you?  I could bring the baton to you as early as tomorrow, as late as 
next weekend, or sometime in between.  I could meet you  at my place, your 
place, or somewhere in between.  

I'm packing up Lurch right now to go meet Ric at Chuckie's Redneck Campout 
just outside Smoky Mountain National Park.  We'll party with fellow busfolk, 
celebrate the relay, and just have a good time.

C'mon!  Let me know!

PS      For the volks on the type 2 list, sorry for the redundant posts.

        Do I hear an echo in here?  
        (looking around furtively, question marks floating in the air above 
my head)
