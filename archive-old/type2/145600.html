Subject: Re: [T2]tire broke inward this morning on me(pics)

  ^^^^^^^^^ 
  theres a better view of the pics.... i uploaded them to photobucket which automatically resizes them for me...
   
  well thing is that the ball joints are brand new(couple months old maybe?) but i am holding no blame here.
  The company that did them is very professional and i would go back to if it werent 5 hours+ away from them. 
  i just gotta get it fixed.
  what it seems to me cause when they were put in i was there and watched and knew what was happening and they showed me as the job was done what was happening.
   
  the arms there selves are worn out,... they tacked the arms but the tack on that side must of come loose? only thing i can come up with...
   
  so the ball joint is still in there its just the arm has came off the top of the ball joint its self on bottom pasenger side... now i got to get her home and going to try best i can for that and then i will go from there on how to get all this straight if indeed i can? 
  hope those pics are easier to see....

  Wow - I have never seen a ball joint actually separate on its own! I have
never personally tried to remove them, but I know that they can be a big
pain in the a$$ and either takes lots of hammering/pounding, a big tie-rod
like separator, and/or a lot of heat.

I don't know the best way to get it home - I guess a wheel dolly - then
towing it with another vehicle would work, I personally would NOT put the
wheel dolly on then actually try to drive it - but really, at least have
some one help you - heck get a neighbor, or a random nice person on the road
- but seriously if at all worse - call a tow company and have them flat bed
it - its not worth the cost of a possible accident...

OK - so on fixing it - since your ball joint is already out of the lower
control arm I would replace it - preferably all the ball joints (2 on each
side, upper and lower control arms) but if all necessary you cant afford to
replace all of them - just replace that one - unfortunately I believe you
need a huge press to do this - this is one of those jobs that i like to just
pay someone to do. If you end up taking it to a shop - just flat bed it to
the shop - that is the easiest route that i can see, yes I know its
relavtively expensive - but by far the safest.

Good luck!
