Subject: A painting accident that turned out good...

On Sunday I really wanted to get my old 72 bus
painted. All the prep had been done and I was afraid
if I didn't get to it that day, then I'd have to go
back over it with the cleaning, etc. So, I rushed to
get everything ready to paint this bus.  I'd painted
about 4 other buses in the past, so I thought I had it
under control. I was going to use the same brand\type
paint as the other times (single stage paint with a
hardener added). The only variable was a new paint gun
I bought for $15 at an auction a couple of weeks ago.
After rushing everything together, hooking up the
compressor, etc. i started painting. right away I
noticed something different, the paint seemed to cover
a lot more easily and smoother than my previous paint
jobs, I had no runs or anything. I naturally gave
credit to the new gun, but then after the first coat:
D'OH!!!! I realized that I had forgotten to add
reducer to the paint mix!! But... The first coat went
so well, that I decided to skip the reducer on all of
the remaining 4 coats.
Last night I pulled off all the masking paper &amp; tape
and WOW!!  This was a good looking paint job, FAR
better than anything I have done in the past. Smooth,
even coverage, and absolutley NO RUNS!! It actually
looks like a semi-professional paint job!! Leaving out
the reducer made all the difference! it makes me want
to strip and re-paint my daily driver 71 westy using
this same method. 
Anyway, this is one of those accidental good-karma
things that sometimes happen, I have a great looking
paint job. Total cost: Primer $30, Sandpaper $5,
Automotive paint $75 gallon, new auction paint gun
$15, masking tape\paper $5, total = $130.
