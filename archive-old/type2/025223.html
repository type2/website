Hi Mark,

Where to start is the archives.

  http://vw.i405_dot_com/

For reference, you have a type1 engine.  This is the same engine used in a
bug.  Do you have an Alternator or Generator?  Try
http://www.i405_dot_com/vw/stand/ for photos.

On the archives page, try some searches like this:

   &quot;generator near charging&quot;
   &quot;generator near regulator&quot;

Hope this gets you started!

I also suggest you go to a junk yard and locate a volt guage.  This HAS TO
BE one of the easiest guages to hook up -- all you need is a + and -.  A VDO
one out of any VW / Audi would be nice... but any should do.

P.S.  REPLACE YOUR FUEL LINES, you should take your time to learn about the
fuel lines and various places that fuel flows.

My &quot;new&quot; 71 VW camper worked fine for abt one month. It didn't seem to be
holding  a charge so I replaced the battery. It will run in the driveway for
about 45 minutes and then it quits. It will drive for various lengths of
time before it looses a charge. I am not a mechanic but I got the Muir book
and I want to learn.   We live in small rurual community and no one is even
interested, anyway, in fixing it. A friend told me it could be the voltage
regulator, generator or alternator. Great. Now where do I start?  Please
help because I love my new van and I need it for work and schoo.
