Subject: Valve Question

Ok, i will admit, I know very little about Volkwagons as of yet, but I
am learning fast.  However, one thing that confused me were valves. 
What exactly is a 'valve job', valve adjustment, and something about
'lapping the valves'? My question is What exactly do these terms mean?
How are they diferent?  Thanks again...
