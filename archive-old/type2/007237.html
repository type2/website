It seems to me that any cracks in the flywheel, no matter how small, would be
reason enough to replace it. Just replace it and feel lucky that you found the
cracks before it was too late. Better safe than sorry.

I have a flywheel with a bunch of short hairline cracks visible. The
cracks are no longer than a centimeter in length. They all extend
radially on the shiny portion of the flywheel. Should the flywheel be
replaced? Turned? Ignored? :)
