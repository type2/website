Subject: Re: [T2] Bus Interior!

&gt;  She's decided that she wants
&gt; to put down astroturf on the floor instead of a mat (to simulate grass)


Steve did this on his green bus. Looked pretty good IMHO.



and
&gt; she wants to paint the ceiling with clouds (on the bare metal)


Consider talking her into painting on some wood panelling instead. The noise
of an uncovered roof is horrible. Panelling would be easy, even if this
isn't a camper model.



. Hahah... So,
&gt; that said, I only will need (and want) headliner for the front.


WCM has the sunroof headliner: 241-502V-WH $175.40
At that price I think it's a full length headliner. They also have one for a
doublecab: 265-502V-WH $76.20 which sounds more like what you'll need.

Do you have the panels for the areas above the seat stands behind the seats?
