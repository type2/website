Subject: [T2] kmh&amp;mph speedo/speedo swap

I was in the salvage yard the other day and noticed that a late bay had a 
speedometer that listed miles per hour as well as kilometer per hour, I was 
wondering if this is standard for late 70s buses and if their is any reason 
that this would not fit my 68 sc. Also would the matching fuel gauge be a 
drop in replacement?
thanks
ronnie
