&quot;Guyute the Ugly Pig&quot; is my 1980 Westy, and it definitely doesn't
make better than a D.  LOL

Dented, dinged, swiss-cheese rust on the drip rails, rearview and
passenger side mirrors have long since fallen off, it has
approximately 87 dings, 32 dents, 3 different hues of other cars'
paint (benders from previous owner), 1,400 tiny specks of touchup
paint that don't match too well (Mello Yello), interior is falling
apart, canvas has 11 tears and 4 rips, 198 different varieties of
mildew reside on the inside and outside of the poptop, and oh yeah,
it runs like a champ and takes me to work and everywhere to see
live music.

Can't complain.  ;)

hey volks,
i thought id throw a friday bus poll at everyone.
something all of you can reply to, even those lurkers
out there :)  the poll question is:
What condition is your bus in?   I am just curious as
to how many out there are driving restored beauties
down to rusty drivers.  so what kind of bus do you
drive?

A)Restored Example

B)Very Nice (not quite restored but very clean or
original nice condition)

C)Daily Driver (clean but has a door ding here and
there or just a touch of rust)

D)Beater (its rusty, dented, combo of both, people
look at you funny when they see its not abandoned-well
maybe not quite that bad:)

reply back to me and ill try and gather the results
and post back to the list.  so even those out there
who dont post often, reply back.  ill throw in the
first vote:
1973 Riviera- D an excellent beater example:)
happy friday
shelby
