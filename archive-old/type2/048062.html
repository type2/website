&gt; First, this morining after my daughter's check up there was a lady whose car

&gt; I was paranoid about jumpstarting anyone since I know all the warnings about 

&gt; question is: Can my FI bus just not receive jumpstarts, or I am not to give 
&gt; them either?

I have twin batteries, and to give a jump start I disconect the second
battery and jump from that. as for getting a jump I have only done it once
or twice and it has not bothered the FI, but YMMV

&gt; Second question which arose as I was driving to lunch with a co-worker.  My 
&gt; turn signals don't turn off after completing a turn.  I had never given it any 
&gt; thought since I have always had to turn them off since I've owned the bus. My 
&gt; co-worker thought it was odd though.  Are they supposed to turn off on their 
&gt; own?

yes they turn off on their own, but there is a small &quot;nub&quot; in the
mechanism that I have noticed wears out occasionally
