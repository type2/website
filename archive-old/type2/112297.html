Subject: Unusual VW Trivia Collectors Item--

Hi All, 
I just found in my vast archives of VW stuff---a real neat, unusual,
cool, VW Clock---in the form of &quot;Mr. Bubble Head&quot;---the VW parts
mascott--

He is about 12&quot; tall--and his face is the VW logo clock--and his arms,
hands, torso,legs and feet swing side to side as the penduleum for the
clock--
Pretty neat--

He's brand new in the box--never has seen the light of day--nor even had
his clock arms attached or his battery installed--

Scroll down to the &quot;Van Stuff page below for a picture of him--

I thought I might offer him to the VW  community, prior to putting him
to the hounds at E-bay--  

Check him out---

Later,

            ______________
