&gt; Hi,
&gt;
&gt; I just screwed the sensor into the threaded hole in the right &gt;#1-2 head.
The
&gt; heads are identical.  If the wire is not long enough, just make &gt;a jumper.

If you screwed a temp sensor in the 1-2 head, you have an engine with 2 left
heads! A correct 1-2 head does not have a 10 x 1.0 sensor hole. Both holes
are for tin screws....6 x 1.0.

&gt; &gt; the sensor was loose.  I tried
&gt; &gt; tightening it but the hole is stripped out.  I think I'm going to try
&gt; &gt; and epoxy it in the hole using electrically conductive epoxy.  Any
&gt; &gt; one have any thoughts on this fix?
