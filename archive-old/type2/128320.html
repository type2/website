Subject: Re: [T2] Fan squeeling UUUUUUUUUUUGH

&gt; All right, the alternator is fixed and I'm back
&gt; to trying to fix the ORIGINAL problem.  My fan is
&gt; squeeling.  I found that someone (DCO probably)
&gt; left out several of the bolts that held the fan
&gt; into place.  It ran silently, even without the
&gt; bolts, ever since I bought this bus.  But now I
&gt; cannot seem to get it aligned properly.  If I put
&gt; my hand above the carb and push the whole thing
&gt; forward, the fan will turn silently.  But I
&gt; cannot get it to stay in that position.

it sounds like either you have the wrong backing plate or the
shims/spacers arent in right or both.
for me. I would pull the engine and do it on the floor where its easy.
its a 70 right?
