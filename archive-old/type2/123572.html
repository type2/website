Subject: cab panel tweekage

list, can the front door panels ever be straightened? when the cardboard
goes can it be re-warped back into shape with water spray then flattened by
weight  - anybody ever try this or another method. or does that sound like
a waste of time.  also, if anybody has the 74-75 orange door panels up
front on their parts buses i'd be wanting them, unhacked. name a
trade/price   - steve
