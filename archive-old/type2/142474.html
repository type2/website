Subject: Re: [T2]age old question(OIL)

Those are the same basic oil change numbers I use. FWIW an old Corvair guy wrote in a book I have that he changes his oil anytime the lines on the dipstick couldn't be seen through... As a recall he was getting big numbers out of his engines too - like 160K with 1970's/1980's oil and filters.
