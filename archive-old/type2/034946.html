Subject: Re: the nature of the problem has changed [was: no output from new fuel 
 pump]

&gt; I got the pieces out of there the best I could, but I'm
&gt; sure some little bits of the flange must have gotten
&gt; down inside my nice new engine.  Now what?  Pray they
&gt; come out in the next oil change?
&gt; 
&gt; Also, have I damaged the cam that the push rod rides on
&gt; top of?

yes i have personally seen the fuel *cam* damaged.  i am assuming from
a similar situation.  

unless you have some sort of full flow oil filter on your engine, why
in the world chance it??  maybe the *filter screen* will catch it and
you might be fine.  i had a fuel pump flange break off on me.  the
last 1/2 inch or so snapped off and fell into the case just like
yours. (to this day i do not know how that really happened).  i pulled
the engine and cleaned it out to be safe.
