Subject: Fair $$ on old z-bed?

Slowly getting '68 ready for inspection--ran her, sans
plates, around the beltway to gain confidence. Like
the wind... TNX to everyone on list who has gotten me
this far.

While pulling a junk bumper, speedo and emergency
brake, i came upon a 70 westy (blown engine, elecrical
ripped out and rust). 

the interior is in ok shape--filthy but not too
chipped and worn.

the junkman will sell the parts or the whole thing (i
don't have anywhere to put it), but is getting sly
about dickering. for a baseline, what should I expect
to pay for the old bed?
