Subject: Re: [T2] Un-responsive clutch

Re acting like it won't shift with engine running-
Happened to me on a long 10k trip-it was very damp out- I put it in 
first, pushed in the clutch and turned the key- the bus lurched forward!
It broke loose by my applying the brakes to keep bus from moving.  I 
assumed the damp weather somehow fused the release plate to the disk. 
Worst case, I thought the needle bearing may have fused somehow, binding 
the tranny to the flywheel. Remember, the disk is attached to the trans 
side of the system, and the release plate is part of the &quot;engine 
system&quot;-ie, attached to flywheel- if one fuses to the other, it will 
never separate the tranny side and you can't shift.  If it stalls when 
trying this, you'd likely have to pull the engine and check it out.
-First make sure by lying underneath as someone pushes the clutch pedal 
that the arm the cable goes to actually is pulled back- ie, cable is not 
stretched or gone.  Yes it could be a popped release bearing, but you'd 
likely hear that bouncing on the trans shaft, and this is a guess- the 
resistance of the pedal would be greater than normal if fused plate and 
less than normal if popped bearing?
