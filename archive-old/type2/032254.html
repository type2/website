I have reinstalled my newly rebuilt engine and am eager to try to start
it.  However, in the process of replacing hoses, I've become confused
about how all of the were connected.  My manuals (bently and haynes) are
very poor in terms of providing this information.  I have a few spefic
questions, maybe someone with a simialr rig can see how theirs are
connected...

SMALL VACUUM LINES:

there are six places where these connect:

-deceleration enrichment valve, mounted on the firewall
-airfilter box, seems to run a diaphram for the carbon canister system
-fule pressure relief valve,  near #3, sends gas back to the tank
-air distributor box, between pipes supplying intake air to #3&amp;#4
-distrubtor vacuum chamber, adjusting spark timing.
-back of throttle plate housing

I have two splitters (3-way connections), which makes it seem likely that
either there are two sets of 3 or one set of 4 and one set of two, but I
don't really know...

LARGE HOSES FOR CARBON CANISTER SYSTEM

this is easy, fan shroud upper left to carbon box left, and carbon box
right to air filter box.  small hose right goes to weirdo 'separator'
things...

VACUUM LINE FROM AUTO TRANNY

this seems to go to the left side of the air distributor box, it requires
an attachment, since both tubes are the same diameter.  I have a T
spliter, which would serve that function, it could then go to one side of
the decel valve...

DECEL VALVE.

I absolutly don't know how this hooks up.  has two big lines and one
little, I believe the top big line uses the U shaped precast plastic pipe
which connects to the main, large intake pipe just a few inches away, the
bottom large pipe might go to the left side of the air distributor box,
using the T connection?  but I don't know.

AIR BIPASS VALVE

Electrically controled extra air valve, this has a large diameter elbo,
what does it connect to?  I think to the huge precase main air intake pipe
which right next to where the crankcase breather connects, but I'm unsure.

HUGE AIR INTAKE PIPE BETWEEN AFM and throttle

this has three small branches, one is the biggest and goes to the crank
case vent, thats easy

one has a plastic U shaped pipe which seems only to be able to reach the
top of my decel valve,so I assume thats where it goes.

the third seems to go to the air bipass valve, but is that all it does?
is this connection shared with anything?

Sorry for the length, assuming anyone reads this far, I hope people can
understand my descriptions/names.  Thanks for any help!
