Hi,
 	Is there a website somewhere that's up to date with the plans for
the tour? I had a trawl through the archives last week but couldn't find
anything up to date.

 I'll be in Canada during the first week of February
(Vancouver/Whistler)
and could probably take the box home with me to start on the European
leg of the tour, if that would fit in with the timetable. I'm not
currently registered as a tour participant, but would like to take
part, if I can work it in.
 I'm based in central Scotland these days.

Cheers,
	W.

 &lt; Sorry if this should have been a Friday posting. &gt;
