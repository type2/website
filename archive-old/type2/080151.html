Subject: Re: [T2] 74 vs 78 campstool height-why different?

Incidentally, I would LOVE to buy the newer, taller version...preferably
green plaid.  I have a shorter one to trade with the blue plaid top. Sorry
no sale until I get my correct one for a '77.
Jay

&gt;The reason for this is for the height difference of the front seats

&gt; non-swivel vs. Swivel seat...)    the swivel seats are
&gt;up a little higher because of the swivel base.......
