&gt;You have to be careful because if your sticker says 875 +/- 75 and their instruments (the only ones that count) clock you outside of that range you fail even before they get to the emissions test. 

Yuck, they must have gotten more strict since my last California emissions test, which was back in 1995.  Back then, the spec was something like 650-1,050rpm so I always set mine at about 1,000rpm.  I don't think there was any idle rpm spec on the sticker - it was shown on the screen of the gargantuan emission check machines.  Not sure where the spec originated but I remember them looking stuff up in a large book.
