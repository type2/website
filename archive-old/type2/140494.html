Subject: Re: [T2] Lapping Valves

Don,

You might do a Google search on valve lapping. I've lapped more than a few
valves but seems like for the past 20 years or so the message is that
lapping is not necessary or desired. It produces an inferior finished
compared to the proper grinding stone. Recently, a machinist explained that
lapping creates grooves in the valve seat and face with even the finest
compound. Once the valve wears in and sinks a bit these grooves no longer
align.

 Well, since decent used 1700 heads for less than what I paid for my whole
 bus are nowhere to be found, I've decided to repair what I've got.

 I have a 1700 head that was sent to me by another list member months ago
 that is fine except one of the intake valves fails my Windex test (allows
 the fluid past the seated valve). The spring heights are all ok and the 
seat
 appears fine. The other 3 valves in that head are all seating nicely as
 well.

 So tonight I'm going to pull the head apart and see if lapping that leaking
 valve (assuming no cracks or anything are hiding underneath) fixes things.
 If so, that's the head I'll put on my bus. (Yes, I'm going to cc both heads
 to make sure they're close in volume.)

 My question is, should I lap the other valves while I've got it out? And do
 the other head while I'm at it? Both heads need to come off anyway so I can
 finally fix that busted exhaust stud and lapping isn't terribly time
 consuming. Just wondering if it's a good idea, or if I should leave well
 enough alone.
