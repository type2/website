Subject: Rust advice

Folks,

What's the best way to deal with rust holes in the battery trays?  I see
there are replacement panels available but I have no idea how much work is
involved in fitting them.

Also, when my windshield was replaced I was told there was a lot of rust in
the body.  I hear this is common.  Anyway, rain is starting to come into the
cab area and some rust is visible from under the seal.

At one of the on-line parts under I saw an &quot;inner rust repair panel (pair)&quot;
under a body-parts/windshield category.  What is this for?
