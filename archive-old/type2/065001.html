Subject: Switching Oil Types

Hey all-

A while back there was a lot of discussion on what was the best weight
and kind of oil to use...Muir talks about ruining an engine by switching
from mutiple weight to detergent oil (I think)...does that mean I
shouldn't switch from say 10w30 to straight 30 weight?  

Comments appreciated.  Thanks!!
