 Mileage is  proportional to the drivers age.  :-)

So, as my '59 got 31mpg when I was 20, ........

My 73 with a 2l motor got ~ 22mpg fwy, 18 around town

Why is my bug now getting 29mpg freeway, 25 mpg around town,  haven't got the
camper settles enough to report  a milage, hoping at ~ 25mpg.

You have to consider well tuned?  size of motor?  transmission?   Gearing  is
crucial to milage.   A lower gear splittie trans has a slower top end, but
better milage, and vice versa.
