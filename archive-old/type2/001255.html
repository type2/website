Hello all,

I scanned in the Campmobile supplemental manual for my '79 Westy today,
wrote up some HTML, and made it available on my site.  The camper supplement
is a separate owner's manual that came with the Westfalia campers and
details all the camper equipment.

You can see it at http://www.type2_dot_com/bartnik/csmanual.htm

Note that the image files for the manual pages are relatively large (around
120K or so for most of them).  Sorry about that, but I had to make them that
size so the text would be readable (small type in the actual manual).

This manual should apply to '76-'79 Westfalia campers.  Other campers have
different equipment.

Also on my main site http://www.type2_dot_com/bartnik/home.htm I finally have
some pictures of my '79 Westy available.  Click on the link to &quot;My
Volkswagen&quot; on the left.

Enjoy!
