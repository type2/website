Subject: RE: [T2] Bus Sighting

&gt; From: Jamie [mailto:jrivers_at_globalserve_dot_net] 
&gt; That describes a Barn Door Bus....

Come to think of it, it did have the barn door style doors on the right
(starboard) side of the bus (they used a driver-on-the-right model).  I
didn't know that that model had such a big engine hatch.  Any idea why?
