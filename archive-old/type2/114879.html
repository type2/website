Subject: RE: [T2] Bus Camping is the Best Camping

Sounds like a great camping trip. The Blue Ridge mountains are great in the
fall. I am thinking about taking my bus up their soon myself. I live at the
base of the mountains in Madison, VA, so it is not far for me. It is amazing
how many people stop by and take pictures of the bus or just stop to take a
look when I am camping. They love seeing it, especially kids. I am amazed
myself at how smart VW was when they designed it. I have a larger (27') RV
that I use when I go on long trips, but the bus is much more fun to take on
the local camping trips. Probably designed much when it comes to using every
available inch of space.

I must have missed it on the list before, but what was this thermos idea?
&quot;BTW the
hot water bucket/thermos idea from you guys was great. Was that from a high
roof or a riviera or something else? It was on the list a few weeks ago.&quot;

Later,
Corbett
