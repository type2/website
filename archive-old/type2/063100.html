Subject: RE:  Steerings Gone

All of this talk about losing you steering has made me a little nervous.
If there is a real concern, I (and probably others) would like more specific
directions on fixing this problem.  Since I have yet to touch the &quot;front end&quot;
of my bus, I know very little about the working up there.  I do not know
what piece fails in this case.  Any directions for checking/fixing this problem
preferably in &quot;idiot type phrasing&quot; would be helpful.
Thanks,
