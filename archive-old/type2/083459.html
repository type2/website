&gt; Just something to consider when planning an engine removal:
&gt;
&gt; Why not just cut the body-metal in the lower back of the engine compartment
&gt; on both sides (like it is done on split-screen buses).
&gt; Then weld some mounting to the cut off-piece and the sides of the engine
&gt; compartment, get that rust off and do some painting.
&gt; I did this to my '78 2liter.
&gt; When removing the engine I just have to put away the bumper and the 4 big
&gt; screws holding the cut away body-piece. Put your floor jack under the
&gt; engine, get off the engine screws and just pull it out. No need to even
&gt; raise your bus.
&gt; I've done this a couple of times without any problems.

This is an excellent idea if you intend to keep the bus for a while.  VW
did this themselves with the early bays, so there's no structural reason
to keep the panel welded in place.  I think that VW had a
significant maintainance philosophy change with the type IV.  The type-1
bus was engineered for easy maintainance, while the later buses seem to
make the assumption that you will have a lift with which to extract the
engine.
