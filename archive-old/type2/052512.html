Subject: [T2] large diameter vacuum hose

I am looking for a source for large diameter vacuum hose. By large I 
mean 3/4 inch / 19 MM interior diameter. This is for a:

1976 Westy
2000 CC, FI
California smog spec.

The specific part that I need the vacuum hose that runs from the 
deceleration valve to the air intake sensor.

I have checked the various web based VW parts vendors and can not 
find anything. The local FLAPS guy told me that &quot;I don't think anyone 
ever made vacuum hose that large&quot; as he examined my original hose.

I have about a 2 foot length of 3/4 inch heater hose on there now and 
it seems to work. I hope it doesn't collapse on me.

Thanks and have a great day
