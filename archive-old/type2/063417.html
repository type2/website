Subject: waving

A few weeks ago, whilst driving Splitty, I waved at an early
Porsche 356 (my dream car). To my extreme delight, he waved
back!! Splitty's and my proudest moment.

On boring journeys I sometimes go haywire and wave at
random people (old men on bicycles, little kids in push-
chairs). It amuses me if not them. On the way to the ferry
last week Damon and I waved at a guy in a Carrera -- he
looked at us like we were lower alien life-form (with a mixture
of disbelief, horror and disgust). It was very funny :-)
