Subject: Re: $4000 dollar question

Two of my favorite authors, E.B. White and Wallace Stegner, had what they 
called &quot;writing shacks.&quot; I think Gary Snyder has one. Due to a variety of 
choices made and not made, I can't have a permanent shack in the woods to 
which I can retreat and write (for those who are new to the list, I am a 
historian).

In addition, I have to travel a lot (within an 800 mile radius) to do 
research and to attend conferences. But I hate to stay in motels.

My bus serves all of these functions, and more. I drive it the three 
miles to work every day (I ought to ride my bike, but I actually like to 
retreat into the bus and think a couple times a day). So it's also a 
daily driver, though I could easily get to work (and have done) if it 
were sidelined for a repair.

The last time I used it for camping, a couple of weeks ago, I sat inside 
from the time I got up (around 7:30) until well after noon. I love it 
inside my bus. I love the woodwork I did, and the Westy-inspired 
convenience of it all. I write like a madman in there. Good thing I am 
too much of a Luddite to have a cellular modem, or these posts would be 
more frequent and much longer.

I like to drive to the local bookstore, buy a book, grab a taco next 
door, go back to Peregrine, and sit in there and read the book 
cover-to-cover, and then go home.

I love knowing that I can keep her going until she is really and truly 
dead. (If you missed it, see the account of my ill-fated trip last April. 
It's in the archives.)

Fact is, I love my bus and what I can do with her so much that I hate to 
waste any time concerning myself with repairs. 

That's why _I_ make a fuss about preventative maintenance. For me, the 
adventure is listening to birds and the crisp rasp of desert bushes in 
the breeze. It's about sleeping way better than I do when I am at home. 
It's about prefering the sound of my engine and the wind through the 
&quot;sealed&quot; poptop to the blather on the radio.  

So I would much rather do these things when I am on the road than to fix 
something that I could or should have fixed at home where the birds are 
few, the car alarms drown out the breeze, and my bed isn't half as 
comfortable.

But your mileage may vary.
