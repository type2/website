Subject: In search of a good...mechanic

Hello friends,

I live in South Seattle, in the Georgetown neighborhood &amp; have a '73 
&quot;westfakia&quot; with a '78 FI engine.  I'm looking for a good &amp; inexpensive (I'm 
willing to pay fairly but working with a smallish budget) mechanic that I 
can depend on regularly.  I realy prefer to stick with one person so they 
know what's been done...VW John was my guy but he's out of the biz.  Right 
now, I need fuel lines replaced, oil changed &amp; some general 
maitinance/checks for a roadtrip comming up in May.  I would prefer someone 
close to me...in the event that I ever end up with it not running.  I looked 
through the archives &amp; here are some I came up with...I would appreciate any 
feedback, recomendations or sugestions.

TNT Forign car parts
Michael Lewis
Friedels in Renton
Doktor Tim
The Tech Shop
Carls WV 103rd &amp; Meridian
Wolfsburg in Ballard

I kind of prefer independants so if you're in my area, let me know.

Thanks for anything!
