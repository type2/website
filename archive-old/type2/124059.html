Subject: Valves and TDC

I'm having a bear of a time finding it in the archives, so I'll just ask
whoever happens to be online at the moment. :) 
 
I'm trying to find TDC on Cyl. #1 so I can be sure I'm doing my dizzy
work right. I popped off the valve cover to watch the valve train open
and close stuff. I THOUGHT you could tell the compression stroke by
see'ing when BOTH valves were closed. But once I looked, it seems that
they BOTH open and close every 180. Also, on my fan, I have the red
painted line, then another line 180 on the other side with a painted
line on it too. ONE of the painted lines is over a filed notch. 
 
My questions
1.   Is the notch factory or PO made? 
2.   If the notch is Factory, is THAT the mark for TDC of the
compression stroke? 
3.   How do I tell witch is the compression stroke? 
 
Thanks in advance
Chris
