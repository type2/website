Subject: Re: [T2] Glove Box Mounting 

Scott Goodno:  I did the same thing for my 78.  But I
had the hardware.  I doubt there is very much
difference in shape or hardware between your 71 and my
78.  
   
The original hardware was simplistic.  (Uhh, is that a
surprise?)  There was a metal band which was bent into
a hook on the top, and a little stamped sheet metal 1
cm by 1.5 cm box shaped thing on the bottom which made
use of a single sheet metal screw.
    
I'm sure you could find the necessary hardware in a
junk yard which has a couple o'busses.  Or you can
fabricate your own replacement.  Your most challenging
task will be to find a sheet metal screw which fits. 
Not a hard task at all.
   
With the GB out, lets examine and locate the 2 spots
where the original hardware attached.  First, from
above and inside by an inch or two, find the long
slotted hole where the top end of the original
hardware, and it's hook shaped bent metal held onto
the cab panel metal.  Then from below, centered and 1&quot;
inside the GB hole, locate the screw hole.  It points
downward at maybe a 30 to 45 degree angle.
   
Hope this helps.  For me, replacing the original
cardboard (and scabby looking) GB was a considerable
upgrade to the hard plastic and subtantial EMPI GB
replacement.
