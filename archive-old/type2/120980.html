Subject: Re: [T2] sandblast pushrod tubes?

Well, the blasting is free, but the pitting is what I was afraid of.  I
think I'll take your idea though and go get a 3m wheel to stick on the
grinder and just buff all the crap off.  It seems like 3M's also got
some alternatives to wire brush wheels.  I didn't want to spend a whole
lot of time on this, but at the same time I didn't want to put them back
in the engine all cruddy when I've cleaned the rest of the engine ;)

thanks,
Mike

&gt; I used a 3m Paint wheel.  Cleans well and is low impact.
&gt; May even be cheeper then blasting.
