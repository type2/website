Subject: Re: locking the engine hatch

You can rekey that lock yourself, it's easy (even I can do it!). Save
yourself the dough.

Whatever happened to the Type2 Faq-O-Matic? The procedure is/was written
up in there.

&gt; ok so the existing one comes out and the new one should fit in its place. I

&gt; &gt; Check the junkyards. Some buses have them, some don't. When you find one,
&gt; &gt; take it to a locksmith along with the key to your bus. A locksmith can
&gt; &gt; rekey any tumbler, will charge about $15-20 for the trouble, and will
&gt; &gt; probably tell you how much he admires VW locks.
