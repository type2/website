&gt; What causes battery corrosion, is it normal, is it a leak?
&gt; Battery starts bus fine, just lots of corrosion, and I have to keep cleaning 
&gt; it, and it keeps coming back.
&gt; Any advice will be greatly appreciated.

I'm FAR from an expert, now that that's outtadaway. I have used water
and baking soda to clean and neutralize the acid on the battery and
terminals. Clean it real well, the make sure everything gets rinsed
with water (I kinda suspect having distiled water is better, but
that's just a guess). FLAPS usually sell a batter grease stuff that
you can coat the connections with. I got some that was a spray on. It
has helped a lot.
