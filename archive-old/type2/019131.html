Me rebuild a head? if it keeps running like this i may have to. im
relatively new to the volkswagen world ive owned my bus for about 6
months, and it hasent been running for most of that. probably because i
bought it that way and have been fixing things as i go. anyway back to
the problem.

my timeing is at about 28 BTDC right now, it seams to run best there.
when i try to move it up to the 5 atdc it should be, the idle goes
gradualy down, and it aventualy dies, even backfired once, but not to
bad. my Dwell is at about 44 deg. my points are set at 18 thousants of
an inch (i think i set it in the middle of what the bently specified,
think it was .016 to .020) so anyway my question is, whats wrong here? i
think im about to take/drive(shiver) it to a mechanic.
