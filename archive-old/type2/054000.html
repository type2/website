 On my 61, yesterday the generator light started acting up... its wierd.
 
 At low RPM's the light is off.  As soon as i get to highway spped its
 glowing softly.  As soon as the rpms drop, it goes off again.  the bus
 appears to be charging just fine, its wierd for sure.
 
 My only 2 guesses are the brushes in the gen itself are going bad, but
 that wouldnt explain why it still charges... My other guess is that there
 is a short in the indicator circuit of the regulator but not the charging
 circuit...
 
 anyone else have any ideas? is this a classic symptom of ____?
 
 thanks,

sounds like a bad regulator.  my experience is that when the light goes off 
at high revs  it is brushes. when it goes off at low revs it is the 
regulator.   

you can very easily check the brushes.   there is a hole in the top and 
bottom of genberator.  look in it, see the rectanglar slot with the spring 
holding the rectangle of carbon down?   that is the brush.  it should 
protruse above the level of the holder.  check the bottom one too.   there 
are picture in various workshop manuals if this explanation is unclear.   but 
it doesn't sound like brushes.
