&gt; &gt; Do you have to do too many turns on a smaller
&gt; &gt; wheel.

Lock-to-lock would remain the same as the standard wheel.

To answer the silent question &quot;how much harder could turning the wheel
possibly be?&quot;, the standard wheel is about 18&quot; OD. Following is a table of
wheel-size and additional force required (rounded to the nearest %) to turn
the wheel:

17&quot; = 6%
16&quot; = 11%
15&quot; = 17%
14&quot; = 22%
13&quot; = 28%
12&quot; = 33%

No need to go much further than that. With a 12&quot; wheel, the only &quot;racing&quot;
you'll be doing is the 1/4 mile.
