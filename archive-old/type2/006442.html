Does someone have the site address for the guy who did the
heat/soundproofing/rustproofing mods I found text from him in the archives,
but no reference to his site. I know he has one with great pics, but I cant
find it to save my life. The guys name is G. Matthew Bulley, I believe.  I
know this kind of message is annoying, but the archives left me empty
handed. TIA
