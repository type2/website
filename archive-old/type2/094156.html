Subject: Re: [T2] Front Brakes Question, how to distinguish '71-'72
	calipers from '73 on

It is a long a sad story.  The mechanic is a lost case, his tel # is now
disconnected. I should have known better.  He is actually the guy I bought
the bus from.  When I bought it, it had just been inspected, and judging
from the really bad condition that the brakes, and the condition that many
other item were in when I got the bus, I assumed that he had a way to get an
inspection passed easily.  Thus, I thought I would just get him to inspect
it for me.  This after replacing everything brake related: rotors, rebuilt
calipers, flexi lines, wheel cylinders, bearings, etc. etc. I thought it
would pass inspection no problem.  Well he finds problems with the tie rod
ends, ball joints.  He has much trouble knowing how to manage this repair,
hard to get the ball joints in and out, how should this be managed, etc.
etc. I should have just gone and gotten it back.  Well, after 6 weeks of
waiting,  he has the bus ready for me.  Many things have been done by now,
including some welding on the cross members.  But is has passed inspection
and I am really eager to get it back.  He tells me that the clutch is shot,
I take it and go anyway.  He has(had) a big boneyard full of busses and
other stuff and I am not sure what all happened.  I think that he is
probably out of business for good.  I wonder what happened to all his stuff
though.  He had quite a few junkers out there.

Anyway, a few months later, I hear noises when I break coming from the front
right.  I go look and yikes: my rotors have been changed.  Rusty pitted thin
crap rotors.  They have worn the pads to nothing.  I notice that the caliper
rubber seals are all destroyed.  I do not understand this at all.  I replace
the pads and start saving to redo everything.  Now I find nothing seems
right.

I wonder what I have now.  What is necessary to make the '71-'71 to '73+
switch.  It is the steering knuckle, or just the hub??  What rotors do I
use?  What calipers?  I am tempted to just order all '73+ stuff and hope for
the best.  But, I have reservations.  I may do that anyway.  I now have
pretty much all that I need for '72, with a complete set of both, I should
be able to get things going again.  Geeze, what a pain.

&gt;&gt; I let a mechanic prepare my '72 for state inspection-last year.  Ball joints
&gt;&gt; were needed.  Now, getting ready for inspection again, I discover that he
&gt;&gt; replaced my nearly brand new '72 rotors with crappy ones, my rebuilt
&gt;&gt; calipers with worn out old ones, and all my new german wheel bearings that I
&gt;&gt; install have morphed into worn out chineze bearings.  I was not told about
&gt;&gt; any of this.  No hint of this major switch-er-roo is apparent in my bill.
&gt; 
&gt; I guess the questions I would want answered would be - did he switch them
&gt; for the aftermarket junk commonly found at the local supermarket style
&gt; FLAPS (I used to work at one - AWFUL stuff) or did he switch them and put
&gt; your parts which I assume were good on another vehicle????
&gt; 
&gt; If it was the second one - you are going to have a hard time proving it.
&gt; Might be worth a face to face meeting with a microcassette recorder in your
&gt; pocket. I have heard - check this - that as long as one person knows (you
&gt; in this case) that it is there, that it is legal.
&gt; 
&gt; If it is the first, then better start shopping for replacements if the
&gt; system isn't working well. If it is working well I would leave it alone but
&gt; proactively inspect the parts when you service the bus. Chinese rotors are
&gt; often sold in cheap FLAPS that are just barely thick enough to mike out as
&gt; passing based on the vehicle manufacturer's minimum thickness standards. I
&gt; had one customer bring his worn 200K mile p/u rotor in to the store where I
&gt; worked and the new replacement Chinese rotor was too thin right out of the
&gt; box new and about equal thickness to his worn rotor. The ones I bought for
&gt; my Accord back then warped in under 6 months despite my care not to sit at
&gt; stop lights and stop signs with my foot on the pedal (very hot pads sitting
&gt; on one portion of the rotor while the remainder of the rotor was cooling).
&gt; 
&gt; Let us know what happens...
&gt; Ciao!
