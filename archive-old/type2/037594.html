Subject: Engine builder on east coast

Hi everyone,

A while back I had asked for advice for engine builders on the east coast, and thank you for
all the responses I have gotten.
Since I live on Long Island, I chose to have Dub Machining (also on Long Island) do the engine for
me.  The owners name is Augie and does each engine personally, everything from dissassembly
to machining and building it.  He has been in the business for over 15 years and maintains a low production
per year, so the quality is equal or better than the other builders who pump out 100+ engines per year and at
a better price.

He does type 1, 3 and 4 engines (stock and performance) and has full machining capabilities including rebuilding heads.

He can be reached via e-mail at ahoff_at_bnl_dot_gov

I have nothing personal to gain and just wanted to pass on a great engine builder to anyone needing a rebuild since he
doesn't really advertise. Apparently I am thrilled about the quality and price and I will definitely recommend this guy and 
will certainly go back for any future engines.
