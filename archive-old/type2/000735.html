Just a note that I also have poptop canvas, in several flavors:

My basic canvas is less expensive than PLF's, but also does not use the
Sunbrella fabric that the more expensive PLF canvas uses.  My supplier for
that canvas uses a tan material that is noticably heavier duty than the
stock canvas but is a different texture, etc.  It is the same canvas sold by
almost everybody besides PLF, including Rocky Mountain Motorworks, West
Coast Metric, etc., except that my price is lower ($189.95 to $249.95,
depending on year).  All of these are three-window canvases.  I stock them
for immediate delivery, so you can have it within days of your order.  I've
sold literally hundreds of them throughout the years and gotten very
positive reports from users.

I also have the Sunbrella canvas on my website (yellow for busses, gray for
vanagons).  There is also an orange one but personally I'm not nuts about
the color (the same neon-bright orange color of a highway road cone or a
plastic rain poncho), so it isn't mentioned on my website.  Frankly, I get
most of these from PLF, so pricing and lead-time are about the same as if
you ordered them from PLF, although I will be stocking a couple of them as
the spring approaches in order to provide faster turnaround.
