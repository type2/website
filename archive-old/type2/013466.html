X-Diagnostic: MESSAGE MAY NOT BE TOPICAL - S

With all this talk of list benefits (T-shirts, caps,
etc.)
I have been moved to post about an idea I've had since
the original &quot;please give&quot; post but hesitated figuring
it might be too much work, but now I think it might be
a good solution, so here it goes:

I thought I could volunteer to host a batch of eB*y
auctions all to benefit the list.

Here's the thinking behind it:

It may be hard to part with $25 cash on short notice,
but I'd bet each of us has at least one bus part worth
$15 or more sitting around. Maybe we bought it and
then changed our mind, maybe we are keeping it as a
spare, maybe we are just holding onto it for God knows
what reason, but we can't buy a swap meet space to
sell just this one part.....

Well, it could be easier to sell that part on a
certain online auction and give it up in the name of
the list.


Here's how it would work:

You have a part which is worth at least $15 (I figure,
to make it worth the while). You email me one, (or as
many as necessary) JPEG  pics of the item, and a
detailed description. (Those of you without digital
cameras can take pictures of the item and mail them to
me, I'll scan them in and post them.)

I list the item on eB*y.

When the auction ends. I have the buyer paypal the
money into the tedebare account, or mail him the
money. 

Ted lets me know when payment is received. I notify
you, and you ship it to the winning bidder.

Ideal items would be stuff worth at least about $20
and easy to ship. You would pay the shipping
(continental US only) so, for example, an item up to 4
Lbs. would be $6  out of your pocket, US postal.

I would absorb ebay fees as my donation to the list
(I've already given cash, but I'd do this too.)

What do you think?

Ted, you would have to let me know when payments are
received, so if that's not too much work for you, let
me know and I can put a batch up in a week or so.

I figure 20 items worth about $20 each is $400 for the
list.  It's like a big garage sale for the list.

What do you guys think?
