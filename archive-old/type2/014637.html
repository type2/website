Subject: Leaky Seals?
Content-type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII
Content-transfer-encoding: 7bit

quick question; I found the procedure for replacing leaky push rod seals but
there was no explanation for discerning that that was the problem.
is there a visual inspection for diagnosing this as the problem??
thought it was my oil cooler, but it's leaky on both sides...main seal,
mayhap, but so hard to tell...

really, does anyone have any good advice for FINDING AN OIL LEAK??? this is
making me crazy...and sad.
please, any help is appreciated, as usual*
Thanks
Rachel
