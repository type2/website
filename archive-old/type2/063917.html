Hanno,

In 1965 VW changed the chassis numbering system on type 2s. From August
1964 (the beginning of the 1965 model year), the Type 2 chassis number
began with a three-digit prefix. The first digit was always 2 for Type 2;
the second referred to the model, ie, kombi, microbus, ambulance etc; and
the third digit referred to the model year: 5 for 1965, 6 for 1966, 7 for
1967 and so on.

Since those three years were the last three years of split-screen
production, VW made it very easy for you to tell at a glance if you're
looking at a late model split.

Happy hunting.
