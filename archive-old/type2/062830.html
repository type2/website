like
&gt;somewhat of a contortionist when using the crossbar, pulling up on one end,

trying
&gt;that one out.

Maybe I've just been darn lucky over the years but I've yet to come across a
nut (unless it was a total rust ball) that did not respond to heat. My tool
kit includes a MAPP gas torch with the small nozzle so you can get a
pinpoint flame. It's always worked for me on lug nuts, brake bleeders etc.
On tough suckers I'll soak with penetrating oil such as mechanics helper
then heat it till I get scared. Never needed more then commonly available
leverage to crack 'em loose. Just my .02

See ya on the road
