&gt;This, of course, is very disappointing. I _know_ I torqued the nuts 
&gt;to eighty pounds (with a bar torque wrench, 1/2&quot; to 3/8&quot; adapter).
&gt;
&gt;Does anybody know what I might be doing wrong?

Maybe your torque wrench needs to be re-calibrated?  

I assume you put the funky 5-hole (6 if you count the one in the center)
washer back on underneath the 5 flywheel bolts?  

On the fan-end, are you using the correct bolts to attach the fan to the
hub?  The ones that should be there look different than the other bolts in
the engine.

Just a few ideas.
