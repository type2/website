Hi all;
   Nikki just called from Tucson, bus is running good and she's headed
for Phoenix. Listee David Christensen in North Phoenix emailed me with
an offer of a parking spot, water and shore power for Nikki and I passed
the information on to her.

   Thanks David!

   She has noted a puzzling  increase in gas mileage, up to 20 from 16,
but the bus is running cool, smooth and well. Busma lives. (Might have
something to do with the careful valve adjustment and Rob's carb
fiddling, who knows?)

   In any event, Nikki's on the road, headed home, running good.
