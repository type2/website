&gt; Can't find this in the archives.  When I turn a hard left, not a

This is a special safety feature designed to warn drivers before you
make a left turn into traffic.  It eliminates the need for you to take
your hand off of the wheel during the turn.  Buses exported to the UK
and Australia worked the same way except the turn was to the right. 
Buses exported to New York simply had the horn locked on all of the
time...

Ok, I couldn't resist!  Ignore the above!  Your problem is actually
that the ground wire is accidently grounding somewhere along its path.
 I'd first look around the steering box, since this is where the wire
moves a bit when you turn the wheel.  Find the work spot, put some
heat-shrink or tape on it, and the problem will go away!

I wouldn't pull the wire out of the steering column except as a last
resort.  It is a challenge to get it back in.
