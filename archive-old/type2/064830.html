Is this stuff synthetic or natural base oil (the kendall oil I mean)?

I have heard that Redline synth oil will also drop the temperature about 
20 degrees in a VW motor, but  - BE CAREFUL!
When the oil temp is regestering lower, it usually means that is not 
soaking up the heat the engine makes. Most people would like to attribute 
the lower oil temp reading to less friction - I do not think this is 
necessarily so, but I wont stake my life on that. BUT - it is a noted 
phenomenon  that synth oils do reflect the heat back and do not soak the 
heat up. I have heard that a natural base, detergent straight 40W oil is 
the best to use in VWs and change it frequently.

Just wanted to offer an opposing view point for people to muse over!
