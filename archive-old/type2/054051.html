Subject: A new click heard from...

Hi Volks,
Climbed in my bus this morning , turned the steering wheel about 1/4 turn
and heard a click. Turned it back the other direction and heard the same
click, also within a 1/4 turn. Not loud or clunky, just a click. Goldie, my
'71 bus, handled normally on the way to work. As I am leaving on a 1000 mile
trip on Thursday, anyone have any ideas I should check out before I go? As
always, TIA TBear
