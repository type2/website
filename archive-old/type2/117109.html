Subject: auto tranny and other ?'s

                      well, i've been working in my little spare time
taking
                      the stuff off of the old engine and putting it on my
                      running engine and when i went to take the plate that
                      bolts up to the torque converter off i noticed that
it
                      had the triple square bolts on it like the cv's but
                      bigger, so, what size are these?

                      also, when i took the flywheel off of the good engine
                      i noticed what looked to be an inductive circuit of
                      some sort that plugs through the case right behind
the
                      flywheel like something for measuring rpm's but it
was
                      ruined.  i'm tempted to take it completely out but
                      then i'd have to plug the hole with something else so
                      i'll probably just leave it alone.

                      also, when taking off my carbs i noticed one engine
                      had a spacer between the manifolds and the heads and
                      the other didn't

                      one engine had big bolts on either side of the head
                      just to the outside of where the manifolds bolt down
                      and my other engine only has one on the drivers
                      side????

                      anyway, gurus please send me your wisdom, thank you.
