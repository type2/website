Subject: high heat

  I almost wish I'd followed the advice of the mechanic a couple of weeks
ago who told a bus owner they's be happier not knowing the temp.  
I installed the VDO oil temp guage and used the dipstick sender.  as I
understand the previous postings, the dipstick should run a higher reading
due to location..  I had my 1600dp up to 280-290 on the guage in 90 degree
temps last week.  I'm using Mobil 10W30, have less than 10k on the motor and
have retarded the timing as much as I can.  Tomorrow morning I'm gonna
tighten every exhaust connection I can reach since it's been getting louder
over the last few weeks.  
Any other checks\tests I should preform in an attempt to cool it down?  I
live in Montana and while 90 is the extreme, long steep hills are not.  I
will likely change to a synthetic oil prior to the trip in an attempt to
maintain lubrication qualities at high temp.  Other than that I'm at a loss,
suggestions?
thanks
