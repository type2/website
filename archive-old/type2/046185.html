Subject: [T2] RE: Dual Solex -&gt; number three retarded -&gt; 009

Mike asked:

&gt; VW retarded the spark to the #3 cyl Type 1 to assist in it's cooling.
&gt; What
&gt; adjustment do you make with a 009 or 050 mechanical advance distributors,
&gt; neither of which have this retard built into the point cam?
&gt; 
&gt; How do you adjust the FI systems to obtain a variety of fuel flows to
&gt; individual
&gt; cylinders? Vary fuel injectors with different oriface sizes?
&gt; 
&gt; Love,
&gt; 
&gt; Mike D.
&gt; 
	[Crick, Bill ]  Mike: There is a small nut at the base of the
distributor
	near the engine case. Turn this nut counterclockwise. Remove the
distributor.
	Put in a vacuum advance distributor. Turn the nut clockwise until
tight.

	If you are really attached to the mech distributor, you might be
able to change the shaft or cam
	for one from a vacuum advance unit, but then you'd have to live with
that lift, duration which I don't 
	know if its different. If you're into racing that is so advanced
that you are jetting, 
	or injectoring for each cylinder, why not just get a custom dizzy
shaft fabricated. Given you're probably
	buying new pistons every race or two, the cost wouldn't be
significant. A custom shaft should last
	several races, maybe the whole season? Or just hide it in the tire
budget;-)
