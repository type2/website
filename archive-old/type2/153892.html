Subject: Re: [T2] Rim Color

From Patrick Ctti:

Good day People,

 I just got some new tires, Michelin LT 195/75R14 93R. 6 ply...They have been suggested by my local mechanic..
what you guys think!  Mega Tread on that I tell you...

 Any how, has I probaly will have those tire for ever...(bus life wise) I'm
getting ready to get the rim heat coted (baked), I wonder what is the the
spec on the original color for a Transporter '77.

The original color of the van is ..Top white and bottom senecal red...I'm
thinking white but what are the facts..!!!

 ----------------------------------------------------------------------

Not another tire question!!!  &lt;grrrh&gt;

Your local mechanic is WRONG.  The 93 on the sidewall is the load rating. It is TOO low. 93 = 1433 lbs.
WRONG!!!!  Minimum is 1540 lbs in a reinforced sidewall. http://www_dot_car-videos_dot_net/info/tirespecs.asp
Scroll down to Load Index.

READ your owners manual before listing to a local yokel.
Page 51 of the 78 bus owners manual explains the CORRECT tire you need:
