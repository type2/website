Subject: Continued charging system issues.

OK, I was brainstorming my failing charging system tonight and came up
with several unanswered questions...

First, history...

Before I obtained the '74 bus...
charging system not working correctly, due to a few different things I
observed, primarily reversed battery connection (PO was a dipstick!) and
also loose fan belt.  (what's that thingy for? Oh.)  The system had been
jump started, or attempted, with reversed battery connection, and
possibly with correct battery connections.

So, this would lead me to believe that the entire system is compromised.

When I received the bus...

Initially, red gen light ON when battery connected, test light revealed
short in system, red light OFF when motor running, key in ON position,
charging system still not working.

Then, during test run where battery was run to practically dead...
Rather suddenly, while driving, red gen light comes on, charging system
still not working.  After that, no more short in system, as verified by
test light.

Steps taken/observations made:
1. replaced battery
2. bought fire extinguisher (I really do listen!)
3. bought/replaced voltage regulator (Thanks Bus Depot)
---&gt; after these steps, still no short in system, still red gen light ON
when key in ON position, still no charging system.
4. ordered new alternator from Bus Depot.
5. VOM revealed battery at ~12.0V during idle
6. burnt (to a crisp) wire underneath bus, running with (I'm not sure,
but possibly IN) main conduit running to forward fuse box.  Wire could
have been blue, perhaps.  Rather burnt. disintegrated. dead.
7. blue wires in the conduit near VoltReg, one wire going into funky
connector attaching to two blue wires.
8. red wire w/ white stripe (thicker, perhaps 8-10g) coming from conduit
into engine compartment, attached to NOTHING, hot with 12v constantly,
if I remember right.

now, from other posts...

Hopefully it is not the BLUE wire that connects to the D+ terminal ... The blue wire is for the dash lamp, and is required for the charging system to operate...

So, would that burnt out wire underneath possibly be that blue wire, wrecked during reversed polarity issues in the past?  Could that wire be the issue?  I may be able to replace it, although if it runs through conduit, it may have to be a messy temp repair to see if that's the problem?  This means I may end up with a spare alternator?

and courtesy of the Type2_dot_com library, Morris Aruthur writes..

/*To check the alternator without voltage regulator:*
/

/With the fat red wire hooked up to the battery (or starter bolt),
unplug the wiring harness from the voltage regulator and jump the green
wire to 12V and start the engine. This tells the alternator to deliver
full capacity current to the battery. You should see ~13.8V at the
battery. If this works and you are not getting the 13.8V when the
harness is hooked to the voltage regulator as normal, then point fingers
at the regulator. If it doesn't work, then you know your alternator is bad.
/

/Could this be the red wire/white stripe that is hot and unconnected?  I
haven't quite gotten to this step yet, although with my questionable
blue wire under the bus issue, I don't know if this would even be a
valid test?  Oh, and I haven't figured out where the blue wire (or the
main conduit) actually emerge from the floor/ front of the bus, although
I think I figured it out... maybe.
/

/Oh, and one more thing... the P/N on my old VoltReg (01090600016) did
not match the new one I got from BusDepot (0192062007)(my fault, not
theirs) but the one on the bus matched the one they had listed as
&quot;Suppressed.&quot;  I got the one listed for both alternators, thinking I was
on the safe (and cheaper) side.  What does that whole &quot;suppressed&quot; thing
mean?  Would the apparently non-suppressed VoltReg not work?
/

/I really want this bus charging properly by Friday, when I am moving to
Seattle.  It would be nice to NOT have to trailer it for the 200 mile
trip.  My alternator should be here Thursday.  I have wire, I have tools
to install wire.  My Bentley book is on order, hopefully here Monday.
(half_dot_com people aren't horribly reliable on sending immediately) My
Muir books (on spiral, one paperback bound) are here.  I am in Battle
Ground, WA. (just north of Vancouver/Portland.)  I may even enlist the
assistance of a local, should thursday come with no success!  I'll
provide some brews, if that's what it takes.
/

/Sorry for the rush, and I hope I've explained enough to get the answers
I need.
/

/Oh, and I DO have a fire extinguisher.
