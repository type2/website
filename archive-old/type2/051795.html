Subject: Re: [T2] Why do we paint tin?

&gt; It's not just the sticking that is the problem.  If you put regular 
&gt; rustoleum on your tin, it will stink very badly as it burns off.  
&gt; And it will burn off.  Some of the tin does get very hot.  

Very hot???  What parts??  Mind you, lets be sure we're talking apples and
apples. I tend to refer to an upright engine...but even a T4 engine, I
cannot recall one piece of enginetin that should get hot enough to burn a
standard rattlecan paint off.  Case included. (obviously, dont try and
paint your heads...and Al cases require a bit of prep for paint to
stick..)

When I pulled the heater boxes off of my upright, I had about 40k miles on
the rattle can primer and paint. Standard stuff, not &quot;high heat&quot;. The
only parts that were burned off were the actual exhaust pipes (where it
bolts to the head, and passes into the muffler)


I have ~ 1200 miles now on the rebuilt engine, fully painted with
Rustoleum. (minus muffler. muffler painted with higher temp...and the
cyl's).   No burnoff.

The tinwork should have AIR blowing through it, and it should NOT get hot
enough to burn the paint. IMHO of a properly running engine.

(and, on this topic...if you can, use a &quot;real&quot; automotive paint for your
tinwork.  krylon/rusto/etc are SOFT in comparision..even after 10 months
dry time..)
