Well,

Sorry to see you go, but i will have to chime in with a hooveresque bit of
advice here.  To own an old volkswagen either takes sums of money, luck,
or some time and a self sufficient do it yourself attitude.

If you do not possess one of these 3 items you probably are better off
selling your camper and buying a reliable newer car. 

&gt; So, thanks for all that  marvellous advice one and all. If I do manage to
&gt; afford another aircooled, I'll be back.

If you buy  a reliable used WCVW/japbox i'll buy this, if on the other
hand you expect to save money by buying a brand new car, the economics
just dont work out on that one.  By the time you get through paying off a
disposable econobox you could have rebuilt your engine 10 times over i'd
bet. (figuring any new car is around 15k minimum, add finance charges and
that goes to well over 20k if you stretch it out long enough to get the
payments small enough to stomach.)

I wish you the best, and do try to find your camper another owner rather
than sending it to the crusher out of spite.

Take care,

Steve

p.s. it sounds as if your mind is made up, but here in the US you can get
a factory new engine for around $1000.  Might be similar deals to be had
over there.  Anyone can replace an engine themselves given tools and fit
physical condition, the only thing holding any of us back is erroneous
preconceptions about our aptitude or some other crap we were fed as kids
that stuck.  break out of your box!
