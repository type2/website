Subject: 74 Manual Transmission For Sale

Actually, I have an entire 74 bus that I'm willing to break down for 
parts. But, I figured that I'd start with the most valuable bits first.

I don't  want to mess with eBay, rather get this stuff directly to list 
members. Let me knowwhat you want and offer me a fair price for it. USA 
postal code is 37853 if you want to check shipping costs. I've found 
FedEx ground is by far the cheapest of the courier services, and for 
items over a couple of punds, cheaper than USPS. Cashier's checks, money 
orders, or PayPal only.

Transmission: $325.00 or with clutch parts, $350.

Cheers/John Fader
