Subject: Travelling Lexington, Louisville/Cincinnnati, Indy, Chicago

In two weeks, probably Thursday through Saturday. 
Anybody along the way want to get together and talk
busses?  Any must-see VW interests such as junk yards,
vendors, mechanics, shows?  Please pmail responses as
I'm in nomail mode; cc list if you wish and if you
think it is of general interest.  

Isn't there a big junk yard near Lexington?
