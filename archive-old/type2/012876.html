Subject: To Stroke or Not to Stroke

A guy I go to church with gave me a couple of old books he no longer
uses, since he no longer has any VW's.
One is 'Gene Berg's Book of Technical Articles' and the other is 'Gene
Berg's Book of Instructions.'
I know who Gene Berg was, so I have an idea of where he's coming from.
 In one of his technical articles, he talks about a stroker motor with
stock length rods making more torque, in direct reference to buses and
the extra weight.  Is this common to run strokers in buses?  I've seen
plenty of Cal Look bugs with fat motors like that, but what are the ramifications
of a stroker in a bus?  Are there more over-heating problems? Would it
require dual carbs?  The smallest stroker motor I've seen was a 2017,
and that seems like a lot of engine for a bus.

Thanks for the input,
