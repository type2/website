On a slightly cheaper note, curse me for thumbing though
JC Whitless the other day and noticed a line of Excalibur II
furnaces by Hydro Flame.  LP, electronic ignition, 4&quot; hose
outlet, cheapest is 16000 BTU, more'n enough for the average
van at $430.  Negatives are these models seem to want a large
exterior cutout for an RV, but someone should look into the
availablity of other models and even these might fit alright
under the bus or back in the rear corner.  Average dimensions
listed at 18&quot; x 17&quot; x 8&quot;.  Like I said who knows maybe they make
smaller models, price is sure right.
