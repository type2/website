&gt; &gt; In most FLAPS you can buy what are commonly called &quot;vampire&quot; or Scotchlok

&gt; Those things caused two electrical fires on vehicles I've owned. Thank you

&gt; Concur with Steven's double-prong push-on suggestion...hell, cutting the
&gt; wire you're attaching to and splicing the additional wire in is better than
&gt; Scotchlok connectors. Any home warehouse or hardware store, Wal-Mart-style
&gt; store, FLAPS or electrical supply store has wire nuts. Use 'em and be happy.

Scotchlok connectors are the quickest route to corrosion I've found.
Total and complete trash, only suited for hack stereo installers.

To do it right, get a good soldering gun and Kester rosin-core solder.
Strip the insulation from the wire for 3/4 inch, wrap the other wire
around it and solder the connection.  Use heat-shrink tubing if you can or
carefully tape the connection, remembering to allow the tape to take the
mechanical strain on the connection, not the solder!
