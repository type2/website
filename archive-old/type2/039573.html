Subject: Re: V joint 1/2shaft compatible with 76

I wrote &quot;*think*&quot; for '68-72 half shafts because I have owned a '73, a
'76, a '78, and a '79 and all those half shafts were interchangable, but I
have not owned a '68-72. so I don't *know* if they are the same.  

In reading Mr. Lafoon's experience it sounds like his problem was with the
stub axle, which carries the rear brake drum and the rear wheel bearings.
The stub axle is a different part. VW changed from a solid to a composite
rear brake drum in the '71-'72 range, and I would bet that the stub axle
length changed at that time. This does not mean that the half shaft length
changed, tho.  If I am mistaken, Rob, and you were talking about the half
shaft, which extends from the transmission to the stub axle, tho, please
let me know.

I hate to disagree (or it could be the dyslexia) with the Co-administrator,
Mr. Dolan, but I must.  The 68-72 shaft is a different length than the
73-79.  The 68-72 is about a 1/2 inch shorter than the 73-79.  Last year I
stripped the stub axle on my 72 and ordered one through Ronnie of
Type2parts_dot_com and the one he sent was the 73-79 and I did not notice the
length difference till after I tried to tighten the nut down and would not
tighten anymore and still had a gap so I pulled it off and laid it next to
the stripped axle and it was longer so I called Ronnie and he sent another
(the right one) no charge
