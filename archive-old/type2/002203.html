Subject: Make your bus tax deductible (fairly long)

My collection of buses is growing. Buying a bus is a trivial thing. They are
relatively cheap. Maintaining one can be more costly. Insurance, road tax,
paint jobs, engine overhaul etc. Sooo ...  how can you make it affordable.
In my case I have solved that problem by making two of them 'company
vehicles'. I assume this would work in any country as it is a common
business practice although it may differ in some details. How does it work:

First you need a business. In my case I am a tiny business, it's just me. I
am a self employed IT consultant. It does not have to be a full time
business. In most cases it can also be a part time business that you run in
addition to other employment.

Any business has to invest. Office Equipment, Machines, Transportation etc
etc. So it is perfectly valid to include a car. It can be any vehicle, old
or new. The only requirement is that it has to serve some purpose in the
company. As anybody with a business needs transportation that is not such a
difficult requirement to meet. By making it a 'company vehicle' you can
deduct all costs related to the running of that vehicle as a business
expense. That includes depreciation, fuel, maintenance and the cost of
restoration. Expenses lower your profit so you pay less tax. In my case that
alone works out to about 50% of any dollar I spend on the car. In Europe you
also save on VAT (another 17,5%).

A caveat is that sometimes you have to add a certain amount to your taxable
income because the tax man wants you to pay for non-business use of company
cars (i.e. when you use the company car to visit the in-laws during the
weekend). In Holland that is a fictuous amount set to an annual 20% of the
cost of the car when it was new. Ha, ha ... 20% of what a VW Bus cost back
in 1969! Yes, that does not really worry me (actual cost is
tax-bracket-percentage over 20% of say $5000).

Having one car in a 'one-man-band' company is never a problem. However my
fleet is expanding. So the next question is: How can I make more than one
car tax deductible? In Holland the tax man can not dictate the way you want
to run your company. So if you wish to have five company vehicles all to
yourself in theory there is no problem. However, believe it or not, some
people try to take advantage of this rule and want their company to pay for
sea-going yachts, penthouse flats and visits to places of ill repute. That
kite does not always fly. So I wanted to have a good business reason for
owning my 'Classic VeeDubs'. I think I have found it. I came up with a
'company motto' that will soon appear on my letterhead and on the cars. It
is: &quot;Modern Applications, Classic Quality&quot; So to visually illustrate that
motto I will be making visits to my customers in a 'classic' VW-bus which of
course needs to be in pristine condition. Case proven ......
