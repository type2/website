Subject: Talk to your bus...

Thanks for the post.

I just saw the post today, Tuesday.  I went to Comp USA at lunch time,
and found out that the rebates were only good for Sunday and Monday.
Sad, sad, sad......  I so wanted to talk to my VW bus '78 ECU brain
-OBC- to see if it was smarter than me. And since there was 'text to
speech', I could have scanned in some Muir or Bentley or Haynes pages,
and have my PC read me the instructions as I was under the '78
Westfalia, 4 speed trans, FI, hydraulic lifters, camper -OBC-.

Why, there was even a Spanish language package that normally sells for
$79.95, going for free, after rebates.  I could learn Spanish so that
when I went to Mexico to get my VW (Westy, 4 spd, etc . . . -OBC-)
worked on for rust removal and other good VW stuff, I could negotiate a
'best value' purchase.  I would be able to talk real technical VW stuff
in Spanish, and write a trip report -somewhat OBC, but normally passes
for OBC if trip done in a VW '68 - '83, or really, really wanted to do
the trip in a VW bay but only had the F**D Pinto running- than mentioned
the marimba bands, and the cactus camping spaces, and mesquite(o)s and
all the Spanish talk (which I would tie into my voice recognition PC
mushyware) and cut a CD that I could market to the home bound VW'ers
(air cooled, of course, from '68 - '83) who did not have these optional
accessories listed on their M-plates.. -tons of OBC-

There will be another sale for the Thanksgiving season, Friday.  Sale
should be in Wednesday's papers.

BTW, I stopped by Radio Shack and found that the speaker set that I
bought for $30, is now on sale for $20.  this is a 1&quot; tweeter, 2&quot;
midrange, and 3&quot; bass.  Is 45 watts, 15 watt RMS, more than adequate for
my needs.

I mounted this black plastic case (x 2) with the three speakers onto the
molding just below the top bed floor of my Westy. -OBC-.   I took most
of the roof and cabinets apart, so I was able to string the wires to the
front, down the door pillar(s) to the radio.  The speakers are just
above the heads of my rear seat passengers, and just a foot forward.
Nicely placed.

The speaker enclosure had a slope to it in the back, where it is
attached to the slanted molding.  Results in a 'made to fit'
installation for the 78 VW bay window campers; face of speakers are 100%
vertical, base of speakers are 100% horizontal.

Another thing;  Radio Shack is having a Friday only sale on 900 Mhz
portable telephones (black and/or white; I need one of each because I
have two telephone lines in the house). Friday only,   $20!!  OBC =&gt; you
can get further range with the 900 Mhz phones, so when you are out in
the garage or the outside working on your air cooled 68 - 83 VW bus or
camper, you can catch 'dialing for dollars' calling you (sorry; make
that read --- you can talk with fellow listees on technical and
nontechnical issues, as long as it is bus related....)
