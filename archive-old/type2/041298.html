Subject: Charlie Ford's Camp N' Float

Charlie Ford is hosting a camp out and river float at his new outfitting 
business in Hazlehurst, Ga the weekend of June 23-25. 

Camping's free since it's behind his store and he's got a special rate on the 
canoes for the weekend. The Altamaha River is warm and beautiful. If enough 
folks let him know in advance he can plan his famous &quot;low country boil&quot; for 
Sat. dinner. 

Give Charlie a holler at &quot;cjford_at_altamaha_dot_net&quot; for info and to let him know 
you're coming.

Enjoy!

Weston
