Subject: Re: [T2] L90D Pastell White

&gt; WW's catalog used to have L90D in the spary can.
&gt; I've been watching their site for a long time but
&gt; they haven't stocked it for about 2 years.

Come to think of it: may be you can even get paint at
your local VW dealer! The price might not be right but
I am quite sure they have it. &quot;Pastellweiss L90D&quot; was
in use since august 1970 and I have seen vehicles from
up to 1999 still painted in L90D! I didn't see L90D in
the new T5 brochure but the T4 ('Eurovan') was
definitely available in L90D.

It might be an idea if you need small amaounts of
paint and can't get it anywhere else.
