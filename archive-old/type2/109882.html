&gt; Anybody seen this problem: Turn off key, motor continues to run and horn
&gt; blows. Turn key back on, horn goes off and motor still running. Use gear
&gt; and clutch to stop motor, turn off key, all things nominal.

The buses with the dealer diagnostic plug can be started from that plug.
If you jumper B+ to the coil wire, and then B+ to the starter solonoid
right in the diagnostic plug.

On occasion , I have tried this,, and the horn blows! !!

I am guessing here, as I have never taken the time to understand W H Y ?
but  maybe the diagnostic plug has been tampered with, as some owners like
to &quot;clean up&quot; the wiring,,

Just a guess, but I have seen this happen before.
