Sounds like it could be a dodgey CV joint(s).

&gt; Acouple of weeks ago while I was returning from the store with my son when we
&gt; suddenly heard a loud hammering sound that lasted for about 2 seconds and
&gt; then quit. At the time I was doing about 25 up hill and in a hard right
&gt; curve. It was definitely a mechanical sound of the sinking heart variety but
&gt; I wasn't even sure that it was us since there was no effect on the vehicle.
&gt; The thumping was less than 10 per second, in other words less than what I
&gt; would expect of a reving engine. With no repetition, I forgot about it or at
&gt; least wished it away.
&gt; 
&gt; Now this weekend I take a 150 mile jaunt to the mountains and virtually the
&gt; same thing happens and under about the same circumstances; up hill and in a
&gt; right turn doing about 25 for about a second and then pause and then another
&gt; second. Didn't experience it again for the balance of the trip or the return.
&gt; What was different this time was that I had the windows up so it wasn't
&gt; nearly as loud and I had the impression that it was coming from the front end
&gt; of the van rather than the engine. Again no effect felt, just noise. 
&gt; 
&gt; Any ideas? Responses a long the line of &quot;Oh yeah, that's normal&quot; would be
&gt; preferred.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks,
