Subject: Manhattan and VW mechanics

I just recently moved to Manhattan - I am trying to
find a good VW mechanic in the area - my 74 needs some
engine work.  It is only running on 3 cylinders, it
doesn't have the original dual carb engine.  If anyone
could point me in the right direction I would
appreciate it.
