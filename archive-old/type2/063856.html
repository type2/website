Subject: RE: Carver (aka Propex) propane heaters

To all:

Did anyone ever respond to Pat's question about BTU's on these heaters? 
    As my 79 westy has had no perceptable heat in the 7 years I've had it; 
 I am getting older and feeling the cold;  and I've heard that the gas 
heaters are trouble prone,   this little propane number sounds like a good 
fix.   I have asked Carver to quote me a price and approximate shipping 
charges to USA,  and if anyone is interested in their reply, I will post it 
here.  The unit is designed to mount on a floor, with both incoming 
combustion air and outgoing exhaust going through the floor.  ( Mmmm, I have 
to think about cutting those holes for a minute )

I figure that I can hide this heater and the fuel tank in the cabinet where 
the refrigerator guts used to be ( never got cold, killed battery quickly ) 
 and never think twice about it.        Well, I'd probably not carry the 
darned propane tank around in the summer, but I think this will work much 
better for me than the solid gold priced heaters that Ark Mirvis is pushing. 


BTW, I received the same brochure by fax, but they say that the 2400 is no 
longer available.

So now I'm back to being undecided again!  Their Sales Executive is on
vacation and is supposed to contact me, but in the meantime they sent
a one-page (front and back) brochure showing two of their models, the
Compact 1600W and the 2600W, which put out 1600 and 2600 watts of heat,
respectively.  Could someone give me an idea of how much heat that would
be?  Chris wrote of the 1600W model (approx. 14&quot;x6&quot;x4&quot;, the 2600 is 14&quot;x
5&quot;x8&quot;) being entirely adequate even for Alaska, but this MUST be a
different scale or measurement than, for example, a 1500W hair dryer
(which I doubt would do much to heat my bus).  How much would 1600 watts
be in BTUs?  How many BTUs does the BN4 put out?  Other specs. (FYI) are
as follows:

                    1600W                          2600W
Voltage           12 or 24                       12 or 24
Current 12VDC     1.5A continuous running        3.5A continuous running
        24VDC     1A continuous running          2A continuous running
Air Throughput    45 CFM                         75 CFM
Fuel              Butane or Propane gas          Butane or Propane gas
Gas Pressure      28 mbar Butane                 28 mbar Butane
                  37 mbar Propane                37 mbar Propane
Gas Consumption   113 grams per hour             155 grams per hour
Dimensions        360mm L x 160mm W x 100mm H    360mm L x 120mm W x 200mm H

No prices were listed on the brochure.  Also, the company's name has
changed from Propex to Carver &amp; Co.:
