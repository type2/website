Subject: Bus-friendly places.

I hope this is okay for a Friday posting. . .

Last week I was in Eugene, Oregon, staying with my wife's cousin. She asked
if I would run down to the market about two blocks away and pick up some
rice for dinner. I somehow missed the market and drove perhaps 6 blocks. In
the 6 blocks of that street (Friendly St.) and adjacent side streets I saw a
total of 6 different buses of all years, ranging from pre 62 to post 73
model years. That's not counting the 3 or 4 Vanagons I saw. Naturally I took
an instant liking to the place.

I grew up in a not-so-large college town (Chico, CA) and I work in Davis,
CA. Santa Cruz is like this too. All these places are bus-friendly places
and have the same not-so-large college town formula.

I just had to share my observation.
