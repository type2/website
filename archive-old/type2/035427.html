Subject: 75 Westy Owner's Manual [WAS 72 Owners Manual]

I don't know about the 72 Westy, but I'd assume it's got its own
separate user's manual. 

I know the 75 Westy does because I found one under Wendelin's front seat
the first time I cleaned her).

Any 75s out there need a user's manual? Free to first one to give a
yell.

Anybody? Anybody?

&gt; be good to ask if anyone on the list had one.
