i don't know what it is called...but in a jc whitney catalog they have a fold 
up thing that looks as if it can hold a motorcycle...._dot_can anything like that 
be mounted on to a 70 westy? thanks again to everyone who sent me email 
regarding spare parts for my trip cross country......a few of you advised me 
to bring a bicycle incase i break down and need to get to a phone......just 
thinking that a motorcycle would be a lot faster :)
thanks everyone :)
skye
70 westy (still un named )
