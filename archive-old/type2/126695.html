Subject: Optimal replacement distributor

Optimal replacement distributor

Hello List. Well, my stock dizzy has finally given up the goat. I have been
debating to replace it for some time, and this weekend the points threads
stripped out. There's quite a bit of play in the shaft as well, so I would
like to replace it with another vacuum advance. I would like your opinions
on the optimal replacement distributor for this set-up;
1974 Bus, 1800cc, stock dual carbs.
I've looked at the SVDA distributor at aircooled_dot_net. Will this give me the
best performance/cost ratio distributor? Also, anyone know of a distributor
for SVDA's in Canada.  
Thanks,
Matt 


There is a cheaper, better way to solve both of your problems and never have
to set points again.  Buy a Pertronix or other Hall effect triggered kit.
As long as your shaft is not wobbling more than 0.050&quot; ( told to me by
Pertronix engineer) the magnetic collar will not hit the sensor.  If you add
a high energy coil as well you can open up your plug gaps, maybe  to .0050or
.0060, and get better starting and mileage as well ( I have not yet
installed by new coil so can not confirm from personal experience.  The
points are a bear to set, and if you have any shaft runout, the dwell will
be all over the place.  Mine is now rock steady and should never change
