&gt;My guess is that the
&gt;trauma of recent deep discharging has ruined your battery.  I've found that
&gt;batteries these days are not as resistant to being discharged as they used
&gt;to be.  Some can be ruined by a single deep discharge (Die Hard Gold comes
&gt;to mind - POS battery if there ever was one).

I recently found that a battery of only 5 or 6 months--which had been
charged quite a bit, I must admit--was short over 1/2 GALLON of fluid. I
used some distilled water and some other water that had been sitting with a
lid off for a couple weeks. The battery charged right back up and has been
working fine since.

Good luck! Joe
