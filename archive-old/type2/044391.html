&gt; I dissagree with this. Why then would there be air coming out of my
&gt; heater/defrosters with the heat lever only part way down (fan not
activated) at
&gt; anything above 20 mph?

Because your engine fan is blowing air thru the heater boxes.
The blower fan above the engine is only there to boost air flow at idle. Off
idle the engine fan blows a LOT more air then the blower fan. If you remove
the hoses from the ends of the blower fan, you will see flaps. Above idle
the engine fan overcomes the blower fan and closes those flaps. Then the
blower fan just spins, if it is on, goes nowhere.
