&gt; Hi list members.
&gt; Newbie question and I don't have the Benley Manual yet. ( I know, get it!).
&gt; Which side of the trow out bearing faces the engine? My thow out bearing has
&gt; one side that sipns, the other side does not. Is the spinning side the side
&gt; that faces the flywheel / clutch assembly?

yes, young one your insight serves you well. You know this to be true
:)

the side that spins is the side that comes in contact with the
rotating pressure place. so it has to spin.
