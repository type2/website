Subject: Re: [T2] Clunky Steering

[...]

I would look at the steering coupling right away.
Lift up the floor mat. Remove the screws holding the collar to the floor at
the base of the steering column. Slide the collar up.
The coupling is between the steering column shaft and the box. It
disintergrates over time.
Also look at the bolts that hold the box to the frame. Make sure they are all
there and tight.

&gt; I just started noticing when I turn the steering wheel left to right (at
&gt; a stop light, or in my garage) I hear a &quot;clunk&quot; coming from under my
&gt; feet.  It's worse when turning the wheel left, but you can hear it in
&gt; either direction (all of this is while the bus is not moving).
&gt;
&gt; I had a look under there this morning, but didn't notice anything
&gt; right-off.  It also looks like the steering box is leaking a bit, so I'm
&gt; guessing the steering box is the source of my clunking steering wheel.
&gt;
&gt; Can anyone confirm or deny this theory?  How do I go about fixing the
&gt; clunk?  If the steering box needs to come out, how big a job is that?
&gt; Any special tools?
