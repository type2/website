          Gee, I spent a lot of time and trouble to change my '73 with a
carb to FI. It was well worth it. FI is great, don't ever think of
changing it for a carb. It's really a pretty simple system once you
figure it out, you can diagnose it all with a mulitmeter. Also, you need
to realize that your engine was designed for FI -- especially the cam.
With a carb, it's going to run too rich at low speed, to lean at high
speed.
         If learning how to do this kind of stuff is too much for you,
sell the bus ASAP. Lots of downtime, and lot's of work is the name of
the game for old vehicles of any kind, especially aircooled VW's.
