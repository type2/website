Quoth Jamie Auch:
 &quot;Sean and Jamie (Rivers)checked my
timing.  Of course I haven't put on my degree wheel yet for my 009 so
trying to set the timing was a crap shoot! &quot;
Comment on needing a degree pulley for timing a 009- assuming you have
the TDC marked for cyl 2&amp;4, then it's easy to divide the 180 degrees in
30 degree spacings - span a piece of paper around the pulley or fan
(type4 engine) and mark TDC to TDC 180 degrees away.  Fold in half== 90
deg. Divide that in thirds to get 30 degr. increments.  Other than
timing, you can figure out dwell with just a voltmeter or test lamp,
remembering the MUIR edict: Timing is WHEN the match is lit, dwell is
how LONG it's lit!    MB  78 Westy original drivetrain....
