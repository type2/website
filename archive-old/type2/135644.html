Subject: Notes on using a voltmeter on my bus...

I need to get smacked. Hard. Twice.

I found an old digital multimeter while getting things ready to move
to Denver. After jumping around shouting &quot;WooHOOOOO!&quot; I checked to
make sure it turned on. It did, so I ran outside to start looking at
my bus again.

First thing was putting it on my battery. 16.7v!!! WTF? It should be
all swollen and such if it's that overcharged. I pondered for a moment
then turned around and tested the Volvo battery. 16.7v. ??? Ahhh...
Battery voltage differential. Ran in the house and slapped a new 9v
battery in the thing. Back at the bus I got 12.73v. Right where it
should be.

I started re-testing things I had tested with my test light. I was
finding ground all over where there shouldn't be ground. Thinking
either the starter solenoid, voltage regulator, or alternator were
shorted, I pulled back to consider. I still had the meter leads - pos
to battery + and neg held to a wire with my hand - and all of a sudden
no ground. Huh? Leaned forward again and got ground.

Now, I was wearing jeans and a long sleeved T-shirt, so my skin wasn't
touching anything... But apparently the current was able to pass
through my bumper, through my jeans, and to my hand that was holding
the lead.

So I'm wondering how many of the tests I had done previously were
valid. It got dark and my shoulder started hurting again, so I stopped
and went inside. I think I'm going to give my shoulder a couple of
days rest and start all over on Saturday.

Cliffs Notes:
Testing and found grounds everywhere there shouldn't be ground.
Discovered jeans are NOT a good insulator.
Will start from scratch on Saturday.
