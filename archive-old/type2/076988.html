Subject: gas in cylinders &amp; oil

 I have a 72' bus with a new engine and carbs;  after driving 3-10 days I 
will come out in the morning to find enough gas in the cylinders to prevent 
the engine from turning over;  gas has also leaked into the oil.   This has 
occurred about 6 times now!   What is causing this problem?  What is the fix? 
 Does living at a 7000 ft elevation influence this?
