&gt; Yup -- that's life in VW land. I can recall when my wife rolled
&gt; our '69 van one Winter day because the engine, which was running great
&gt; until that very moment, seized up, locking up the rear end on a icy
&gt; road. I swore at that point I'd never, ever own another VW again. And
&gt; didn't, for quite awhile. About 18 years in fact, except for a brief
&gt; affair with a VW Diesel Rabbit.
&gt; Fact is, Blake, VW's are just a royal pain in the ass -- you
&gt; gotta be a masochist to own one. Or any antique car, for that matter,
&gt; especially if you think of it as a &quot;daily driver&quot;...

I'll have to differ with you on that one.  We have two aircooled daily
drivers (69 bug and 71 bus) and have never found them to be a PITA. 
They always start, run great, and I can fix 'em myself.  The absolute
worst engine problem imaginable can be fixed for less than a kilobuck.
 Sure, something breaks now and then, but I can usually have it fixed
in less time than it take to make an appointment to get a C*rysler
looked at.  It doesn't have the fabled &quot;100,000 miles without a
tuneup&quot; capability of newer cars, but the regular maintainance isn't
that hard and allows me to keep in touch with the overall health of
the vehicle.

I suppress the urge to gloat whenever I see one of my new-car-obsessed
neighbors negotiating with the tow truck driver to get their shiny
pride and joy hauled down to the dealer to get it running again.  I
know that a week later I will hear the story about how the problem
wasn't covered by warranty because of some loophole in the fine print
(&quot;warranty void if you drive the vehicle&quot;) and it cost $2000 to
replace the &quot;instigator frammis computer sensor&quot; or whatever.  No
thanks!  

I'd rather deal with the minor problems (or even major problems)
presented by an aircooled VW than be a hostage to any car dealer's
&quot;service&quot; department.
