&gt;&gt; I've been looking at a '72 Westy.  The dude has a drive-away tent in good
&gt;&gt; shape, but he is asking $600 extra for it.  Is this too much or about
&gt;right?

&gt;If the tent is in good shape and has everything that a good price the
&gt;cheapest that I have seen them was $500.  My opinion  is buy the tent you
&gt;can always get your money back.  They are hard to come by

I'm going to chime in that $500-$600 should buy a NEAR perfect tent, you
can find fair ones complete for $300 or so if you wait long enough.  In
fact you can luck into perfect ones for $350 or so if you catch the right
person at the right moment.  Yeah you see em sell for $750+ but the
people buying are real desperate and/or have money to burn.  $600 is
steep unless it it like new, no rips, perfect poles and floor, and I wouldn't
even accept a small screen rip for that money.

They are hard to come by, but there are more than you think out there,
at least 2 sell at Manasas every spring and fall asking anywhere between
$400-$900 depending on the seller and condition.

I say if you want one real bad, buy it if it is nice.  Indeed you can always
get someone to probably give you $500 for any complete tent if you find
the right person.  If you aren't in a rush, wait a while and look if you want
to spend less and can accept a little bit of wear, fading, whatever.  If it is
perfect $600 isn't out of line.  I've given $350 for one never put up, sold it
for $600, then waited another 6 years before I found another when I wanted
one again.  Depends how much time and money you have.  This all for
late bay tents BTW, I got no idea what splitty stuff goes for.
