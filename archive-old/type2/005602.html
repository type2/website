Ron Bloomquist of Roadcow fame has a nice solution for accessory gauges on
his website.

Go to:    http://www.mcn_dot_org/b/roadcow/default.html    and follow the links
to Roadcow details and photos of his gauge pod on the dash of this '71
Westfalia.

FWIW.....

&gt;&gt;  Is there enough room under the dash to mount the 2-1/16&quot; vdo (oil temp)
gauges under the radio above the ashtray? this is in a 79 bus. it looks like
there is just enough but it will be tight. would love to have some input
before I go drilling.  &lt;&lt;
