DON'T use Goof-off!!!  Goof-off works great, but not for removing sickers off
your bus.  I can't believe others would reccomend it.  They obviously haven't
used it on paint.  It cuts paint about as quick as acetone.  I have used both
Goof-off and WD-40 while experimenting, and I haven't found any paint WD-40 will
damage.  Hope you havn't tried it yet or you'll see the primer in about 30
seconds and bare metal in about another minute!
