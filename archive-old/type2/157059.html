&quot;peacenik-hippies, transporting marijauna for medical use only&quot;
  
  Hey Tony, all those guys gave up on VW's a long time ago.  They're  just watching out for the SSI checks.  Can you say Cheech or  (rhymes with Bong)?  Cheers...KR

So, in order to differentiate between Islamo-Nazies, transporting explosives
in their
(probably stolen) Bus and peacenik-hippies, transporting marijauna (for
medical use
only), one has only to ask the suspicious characters to point to the front
seal (Front
Is Front) of their engines...?-)
