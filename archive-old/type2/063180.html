Subject: GAS LEAK!!!

HELP!  I was just getting ready for a trip to Hanging Dog bus outing and   
when I filled up my bus I noticed that on the pasenger side in the engine   
compartment is leaking gas out of the corner of the cover of where the   
tank is.  I think I overfilled it,  I HAVE 2 FIRE EXTINGUISHERS AND I AM   
8 miles from home.  I am still at work and I am really bummed about the   
whole event,  Please e mail me  direct ASAP on what I should do.  I   
probably won't drive it until Hear from someone.   I this a common thing   
on over fills or should I just wait and drain some out of the tank and   
then go?   Thanks Allot!!!   Erick  Really Bummed out!
