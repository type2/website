Bill:
You might have a problem with the accelerator pump injector, the little pipe 
that directs the gas into the throat of the carburetor. It is held in place 
by friction only, and it can leak fuel around its fitting, or even come 
loose and get &quot;swallowed&quot;. So if you have some tranparent plastic to protect 
your face from a backfire, you might try taking a look down the throat as 
you accelerate the throttle to see that there is merely a fine spray out of 
the injector, rather than a flood of gas going down the throat which 
indicates the cause of the problem. If you just have a spray, the spray 
should be directed at the edge of the butterfly valve where it first opens, 
on the down-tilted side.
