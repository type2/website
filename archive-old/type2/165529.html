&gt; I don't know which bushings you guys are talking about (missed the

&gt; the rod...
&gt;
&gt; finally set the shocks down on the floor, and put the map gas torch on
&gt; them.  the rubber bushings that were holding the metal spacers in
&gt; burned...  they fell right out.

Unfortunately, the swing lever bushings are pressed into steel, not
rubber!

You shop must have stunk to high heaven after burning that rubber!
