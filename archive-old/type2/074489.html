&gt;now until you can fix it make sure you get the nozzle
&gt;in past the tear and you should be able to fill up alright.

Take a piece of 1.5&quot; plastic hose (or whatever the nozzle diameter is)
about a foot long. Insert it into the filler each time you fill up. It'll
go past the break and you can fill the tank. Just don't fill too much. As
the man said, don't even try to fix it until you have the engine out. Been
