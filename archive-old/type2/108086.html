Subject: 72 fuel pump rod length

Hey all-
Thanks for the help on the fuel filler hose.
ended up using the Napa hose with an elbow bent out of 2.25&quot; Muffler pipe.

Now the new motor is in, (2.0 with Hydraulic valves)
everything is hooked up but no fuel pump pressure.
I have the fuel from the tank going into the pipe that's closest to the base
(it's also slightly larger in diam)
The outlet to the cards is the hose farther from the base (or if this pump was
upright it would be the top)
running the two gaskets and Bakelite block.

I checked the archives, and found lots about the two kinds of pumps
Looked in my Bentley for the correct rod length but it's not in there.
Can't find a measurement as to how far it should extend out of the case at its
peak either.
Just info on adjusting for the single carbs

I just pulled the pump and removed the rod, it measures 137 mm (also it was a
very tight fit)
Should also note that the pump was new and working a couple of months ago with
the same rod on the old 1.7

Any ideas?  Thanks in advance!

Thanks!
