Hey all...
          Well, it turns out there was no pilot bearing, just the remains of
one...it took hammer and chisel, a hacksaw blade, and a propane torch to get
that old race out of there...*phew*...(note to self...replace pilot bearing
before it fails completely...) Had quite a time finding a new one, so when I
did, I got two (_at_$2.50 each...shoulda gotten three or four!)
          Gosh, I'm learning so much!
