thread...

&gt; Rock on!  I'm acquiring a '76 camper from a friend who doesn't have the time

woo-eee!


&gt; Speaking of which...does anyone have a good recommendation list of
&gt; tools/supplies I should take with me...for repairs, complications and the
&gt; like?  You never know what the road will bringeth!

stuff that i like to have in my toolkit (or that's on my list to pick up):

- set of open/box wrenches (6mm-&gt;17mm at least)
- 1/2&quot; and 3/8&quot; drive rachets, 6mm-&gt;19mm sockets for each, a couple different size
	extensions for each (i carry a 2&quot; and 4&quot; for the 3/8&quot; and a 1&quot; for the 1/2&quot;)
- spark plug socket
- good set of vice grips
- needle nose pliers/wire-cutters
- normal pliers (maybe 2 sets)
- rubber mallet
- ball-pin hammer
- 4-6lb sledge hammer
- set of screwdrivers
- one honkin' big, thick, standard screwdriver for prying, levering, poking, etc.
- feeler gauge for gapping valves and spark-plugs
- Torque heads for a socket or screwdriver
- set of shears for cutting hosing
- breaker bar (apparently available from sears)
- &quot;speed wrench&quot; for removing lug nuts (that &quot;X&quot; shaped thing with a different
					size socket on each side, make sure it's 
					metric)
- jumper cables
- timing light
- tach/dwell meter (nice to be able to sanity check your points easily)
- volt/ammeter
- wire with an alligator clip on each side (optional, but useful)

parts and spares:

- 2-3' of fuel line
- screw clamps -- fuel line size and other
- zip-ties (plastic strips that lock when you thread the flat end  through
		the rectangle on the other end)
- some extra bolts
- a coat hanger (amazing what you can do with a properly bent coat hanger)
- fuel pump push-rod
- fuel pump (they're small and like $15)
- extra brake fluid
- extra oil (2 quarts)
- vacuum hose (if you've got a vacuum advance distributor)
- wheel bearing grease
- can or two of WD-40
- alternator/generator belt
- ignition parts:  when I swap out my old ignition parts, I usually keep the
			old points, plug wires, plugs, condenser, cap, and
			rotor.  Since I replace these as maintenance as opposed
			to when they're broke, they generally still work
- accelerator cable &amp; connector pin (there is one, right?)
- clutch cable &amp; connector pin
- throttle return spring (just a couple spare springs, in general...)
- bungee cords (optional)
- **DUCT TAPE**
- electrical tape
- some extra electrical wire (you can always cannibalize speaker wire in a pinch)
- bailing wire (optional)



non-tool related:

- ***FIRE EXTINGUISHER***
- tarp to lie on
- bandanna to wrap my head in 
- overalls or car workin' clothes
- gloves ( i don't use 'em, but other folks do and I always end up with 
		nicks and cuts all over my hands)


I think that's fairly comprehensive and covers most of my &quot;collection&quot;.
It certainly costs money to aquire all this stuff, but i think it's
worthwhile -- there's nothing like trying to work on a car without
the proper tools, you end up breaking stuff and frustrated.  Sears
also has pretty reasonably priced toolboxes (with drawers, a lock, etc.).

That said, I usually buy craftsmen tools, as if they break you can 
just walk into any sears, hand them the broken tool and they'll hand
you a new one.  This is *very* useful.  Apparently, there are other
tool makers that do this, but it's always easy to find a sears. 
*shrug*  You're even better off if you can buy craftsmen stuff *used*
off someone, but it's not real expensive to begin with.  I do suggest
going with a major tool company though: there have been a number of times
that I've been fixing my car and I've stripped a socket or broken a
rachet when using inferior tools.  This really sucks when you're 
on the side of the road in the middle of nowhere, let me tell you.

anywho, i'm sure this list is incomplete and/or maybe a bit of overkill,
but this is all stuff I've either wished I had when doing roadside &quot;maintenance&quot;
or that I've used extensively.
