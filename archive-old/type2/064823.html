Subject: Welding the muffler

I don't spend hardly any money on my engine, because I am going to 
replace it the second I have enough money.=20

But I have heat a exchange eliminator (PIPE with flanges) that is no 
longer welded to the muffler.

Can I get a little hand torch of some kind to weld this back on just so 
it will last like a month or two.

Thanks,
Patrick
