the bus boys plate replaces the inspection plate. i have one, all it is is an
inspection plate with a hole drilled in it, nothing special , just drill a hole
in your own or pull an extra from a junker, i liked having a nice shiny new one
though with the hole in the correct spot, it is a constant source of oil
leakage though, i haven't been able to figure out how to make it tight
jamie

&gt;
&gt; &gt; looking for this VDO-323888 Oil Temp Sender, Sump Plate $15.45
&gt; &gt; see the following: http://www.busboys.cc/
&gt; &gt; Also search www.busdepot_dot_com for sump plate I think it is less expensive
&gt; &gt; there.
&gt;
&gt; It is cheaper, but it's not a sump plate.  The 323 888 is a temp sender
&gt; only. It can replace the drain plug on a type 1 engine sump plate, but on a
&gt; Type 4 engine you will have to tap a hole for it.
