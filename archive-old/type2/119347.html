Subject: Engine tin screws

I took off the engine tin to do some painting and I stripped one of the screws. I should have had a small impact driver present but I manged to get all of the tough ones off that make a loud crack when I broke torque.

The originals are the ubiquitous metric phillips cheese head style (the worst design). I see several people sell kits of shiny slotted engine tin screws. I assume the bug and bus screws are the same except for a couple of places where length is a concern. The part numbers seem to be the same.

I'd prefer another style of screw that either of those two. Any recomendations?
