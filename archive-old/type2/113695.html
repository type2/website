Hello,
I have recently received help with wiring up my
sink from this list and it worked! Thanks a lot guys.
Now that I got the sink to work, I found out that the
tank leaks where the pump and drainage regulator screw
in. I don't want to patch it up fearing that water
will eventually leak out, so I'm either looking for
one that's not like that.

.........Mine failed on the 76 Westy, and I tried some temporary solutions 
which worked so well that I stopped looking for a way to fix all that 
complicated old broken leaky stuff. I bought two gallons of disilled water 
in plastic gallon jugs with screw caps. Cost about a dollar and a 
half.  When I want water, I unscrew the cap and pour out what I need. 
Simple, inexpensive, new jug and cap every time, so there is nothing to 
wear out. This method fits your stated requirements otherwise. And the 
water is always clean and fresh from the manufacturer. It wasn't the answer 
I wanted , and it probably isn't what you had in mind, but it beats not 
having water. And it turned out to be the best answer for my family.

...or, does anyone know where
to buy a new one. Just as long as it fits, it doesn't
matter if it has the same capacity or not. I'd prefer
a new one. I have a 77 westfalia. Thanks a lot.
Tim
