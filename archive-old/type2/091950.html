Subject: Automatic Transmission-curse or blessing?

Hi-
I'm looking for feedback, bouquets or brickbats, on T2 Automatic 
Transmission. I found a cherry little &quot;weekender&quot;, a  '74 for sale. I 
was all excited, until I saw the automatic shifter on the floorboard.

I dont know anything about these. Are they any good? Should I avoid like 
the plaque? Or are they pretty decent units?

 I'd appreciate any and all candid opinions from those who may currently 
have, have had, swear by them or swear at them.

At first guestt, and knowing about the hassels of  trying to convert 
auto-stick to manual in ghias, I assume a conversion is totally out of 
the question. Correct?

Many thanks,

Joe
