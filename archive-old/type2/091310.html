Subject: Re: bus stopped in a bad place

Thanks to all for the leads...Because it had a low
fuel level when it stopped, it might have sucked up
some crud. Plan A is to deal with that.

My job (image that!) has prevented me from doing
anything yet. i'm going to talk the hamburger joint's
manager (and smile a lot) into letting me come back
tomorrow early a.m. to get the bus.

For no good reason, I really want to drive it home on
its own power, even if we limp in on a wing and a
prayer. Despite several problems, it's never totally
left me marooned yet. Fortunately, i live about 5
miles away.
