Subject: saga of NJ emmissions passing + distr qu

distr qu- Beltley says timing is 5 deg ATDC for 75, but 7.5 deg BTDC for 
later busses- I noticed I did her bus at the later 7.5 as that weas on 
the degr scale (which may have been pulled from a later bus)- why the 
diff, Karl??  The distr may be a later one, but I'd have to pull it to 
see the numbers.
Bus- daughter's 75 bus with orig FI stuff on it, passed fine 2 years ago 
after a top end rebuild with rod bearings included. Only problem in last 
2 years was a random hesitation I traced to a flakey double 
relay/contacts, cleaned contacts and replaced it.  It also starts 
&quot;hard&quot;- ie crank when cold  5-7 sec, let wait a few seconds, crank again 
and it starts grudgingly- idles poor (need to rev it) until warm, then 
runs fine). This could be a faulty cold start valve?  Normally this bus 
does 22mpg on the highway, but did notice on drive from Savannah it only 
did 16-17, which I thought was due to rediculous 40 mph winds in that 
storm up the coast!    Due for insp, passed all but emmisions, like 4.3% 
C0 and 337 hydrocarbons. (300 and 3% allowed.)  Temp sensor OK, fuel 
pressure a bit up on my gauge (35 with vac connected to pressure reg, 
about 40 disconnected.  Plug I looked at looked a perfect clean light 
gray.  When hot, I thought it odd I could blow/suck through the aux air 
valve hose-may be why it idles a lot faster when warm?  Local VW mech 
suggested I retard the timing, which I did, but noting that tightening 
the clamp really changed it so I did it again, setting it to about 1 deg 
BTDC.  Opened up the idle mix air on AFM a full turn. Went thru 
inspection and it was worse, like 550 hydro and about 5% CO-WTF?  At the 
station I checked the timing and it was 16 deg advanced!  Could the 
weights be sticking outbound? (but idle was near 1000 rpm). So I retimed 
it, opened up the AFM a full 6 turns total and we went through again- 
passed fine (about 1.86 CO, hydro under 300.  So timing really affects 
emmissions- but how could it go that far advanced on its own?
