Subject: Bad alternator?  Possibly related to hard starting...

Hey all,
I learned some things today that may help explain my hard starting when 
cold problem.

Due to detective work I was trying to do on my '81 2.0 air-cooled 
Vanagon (trying to track down a rotational noise on the right side) I 
had made a couple engine starts with shutoffs soon after.  Then I drove 
to the FLAPS for some parts for the Karmann Ghia.  The engine started 
fine during all these instances.  When I was on the way home, I turned 
onto my street (which is a cul-de-sac) and as I was headed to the 
turn-around I shut off the engine to better hear the noise.  Well I was 
able to better hear the noise but that's another post :-)

The cul-de-sac goes slightly downhill, with the bottom of the hill being 
the turn-around area.  So naturally I coasted down into this area and 
stopped, listening closely to this noise.  When I stopped and tried to 
restart the van, I had a problem.  The starter was turning the engine 
over very slowly and the engine would not start.  I thought perhaps my 
starter motor was going bad.  After a few tries and realizing that it's 
just my luck that this happened at the BOTTOM of a hill (D'OH!), I got 
out, walked up the street to my house, got my mom's Dodge Neon, drove it 
down to where my van was stalled, and decided to try to jump start it.

Well the jump start was quite successful.  In fact, the engine cranked 
over quicker than it ever has since I've had it and it started 
immediately.  Hmmm, said I, I think perhaps my battery is on its way 
out.

I figured that if my battery was dying that would certainly explain the 
hard starting when cold problem I am experiencing.

So I drove the van home, and parked it facing downhill (just in case!).  
Then I did some work on the Ghia and came back to the van just now.  I 
took my voltmeter and checked out the battery.  I got 12.2 or so volts, 
which I know is not fully charged, but it was pretty close.  I wanted to 
check what the voltage dropped to when I turned the key to start.  So I 
did that, fully expecting the engine not to start.  However, it turned 
well and started right up, and voltage went down to 10.45 while it was 
cranking.

But here's the suspicious part:  With the engine running at idle, I only 
measure 12.89 volts at the battery when I fully expect to see 13.8-14 
volts!  This voltage did not rise to 13 volts no matter how high I 
revved the engine.  So I wonder if I should blame my alternator or 
voltage regulator.  It certainly seems to me that the battery is being 
undercharged at the very least and is suffering as a result, especially 
in the morning when cold (desperately hoping this is related to my hard 
starting problem!).  

Compared to having my battery hooked up to that Neon's battery, my van 
has been cranking pretty slowly lately.  I think perhaps the battery is 
not delivering the current necessary for quick starting, and we know 
that cooler temperatures adversely affect the efficiency of automotive 
batteries.  I don't know, however, if this is a problem due to the 
battery or if it's the fault of my alternator/voltage regulator.

Any ideas???
Thanks in advance!
