Subject: [T2] 82 westy heat

Hi all,

     I do not have a owners manual yet so I have a question.  On my Vanagon
westy, I have 4 levers on the heater/ventilation panel.  I know the bottom
two deal with the ventilation &amp; where the fresh air goes.  The question is,
does the fan for the blower have anything to do with heat output?  I am
getting heat out either the floor or the dash dependant on where I set the
top lever.  The flow just does not seem very good even compared to my past
bay windows.  As far as I can see, the various doors are opening/closing
with the correct levers.  Any input or suggestions would be helpful.  I have
a friend sending me a owners manual that may make all this clear.  Thanks.
