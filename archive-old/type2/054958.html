&gt;I just bought a &quot;new&quot; bus a few weeks ago.  I drove it all the way

&gt;Baltimore, MD to Bloomington, IL.  I don't know much about fixing 
&gt;buses, this
&gt;is my second one.  Anyways, it seemed to do great all the way home from
&gt;Baltimore.  Got good gas mileage and I was able to actually pass 
&gt;people!  BUT
&gt;of course it decided that it had to have some problems now.  When I 
&gt;drive it
&gt;in town it can't seem to keep itself alive, its constantly threatening 
&gt;to die
&gt;on me.  The more I drive it the worse it gets.
==========================&gt;
First off, Quit passing people. Slow Down.
Now, run several cans of carb cleaner through the carb, and make sure 
you have a fuel filter properly installed ahead of the fuel pump.

All three of these things should have been done within half an hour and 
half a mile of the purchase. Slowing down should be forever.
