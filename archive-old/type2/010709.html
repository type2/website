&gt;  One of the areas of interest on my '63 crew is lowering some of the
inherent
&gt;  design risks in the drivetrain.  More specifically, risk that I made a
&gt;  mistake somewhere :)
&gt;  

&gt;  First comes to mind is a governor to prevent over-rev.  Either it be a
&gt;  missed shift, broken tranny, failed clutch... you get the idea.  However,
&gt;  I'm going with dual carbs.  Electronic ones that work with the distributor
&gt;  seemed best choice, and I'm going to experiment with one.  I'm curious if
&gt;  anyone has gone this route... the one I have looked at should work with any
&gt;  type of dizzy, and it just cuts out points trigger until RPM drops back to
&gt;  set level.  So far, I've only found such devices intended for racing and
&gt;  they aren't cheap.  Anyone know of such a device for under $100?
&gt;  

Well in the UK a rev limiter costs about £10 ($16 USA) I see them in the my
(somewhat out of date) RMMW catalogue for $29.95(USA). I'm sure they won't
have gone up to $100 dollars by now. Take a look at the distributor page and
the rev limiter is built into the rotor arms.

A damm good idea from VW for prolonging the life of your engine.

Good luck
Bob

PS
For those with catalytic converters these rev limiters should NOT be used -
they work by earthing the HT, which results in unburnt fuel being expelled
from the cylinder into the catylitic converter. This distroys the precious
metals in the converter.
