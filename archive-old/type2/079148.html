&gt; Thanks again for the answers and now I have some follow up questions:
&gt;=20
&gt; 1. How heavy is the engine(sorry, I don=B4t know what type it is at the=
=20
&gt; moment)

a type I engine is about 80-100kg,=20
the type IV engine is about 125-150kg

&gt; 2. What things should I do before I put the engine back in?

as much as possible, it is easier to work on the engine when it is out of
the ubs

&gt; 3. Where do I learn how to read a electrical diagram?

go to the local university book store where they teach electrical
engineering, there should be a book that gives the symbols, I think they
are the same everywhere.

&gt; 4. What is the most importent thing to check on my bus?

many things,  but first, replace ALL of your fuel lines, check your brake
hoses

&gt; 5. Is it comforteble to sleep in a vw-bus?

???? depends on what you need to be comfortable, I would think now in
Sweden it would be very cold.

Happy &quot;Bus&quot; Holidays
