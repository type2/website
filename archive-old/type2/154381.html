Subject: RE: [T2] Silicone PRT Seals from CBPerformance

So do you need a set for a type 1 or a type 4 motor? Those are for type 1
motors.

Hey, is anybody buying from CBPerformance in the next few weeks??

I would love to get a set of these silicone seals for the late bay 2.0, but
this is all I want at this time.

I would be happy to send you a SASE and $10 for a set of the 1949 seals...

I am just curious how they look and feel over the Viton seals

Thanks
