Subject: ADMIN-Kill this thread Re: [T2] Pump it yourself

This already marginal thread has outlived its usefulness, so let's end it, okay?  If you need to vent some more, please do so somewhere else, like the Bus-Life list.  That's what it's there for.

Thanks,

&gt;I think it was to save the pump jockeys their jobs.  They need work too!
