Subject: Re: Master cylinder off, brake line advice?

&gt;&gt;Thoses hoses are at FLAPS, all tooled up and ready to go on. Splits + 68
&gt;&gt;use one size, 70-on uses another (I believe that's right).

&gt;With my luck I'd need one for a '69!

Dag! Either 69s have no brake lines or I should not go jabbering away at
6:30 in the morning. ;)

&gt;If you are going to buy a flare wrench you might think about getting a flare
&gt;crowsfoot instead. I have used those on harder to get to lines.

OK, what's the difference? I don't know the name of the tool I'm talking
about. If it were my druthers I'd call it a crescent wrench, because that's
how it's shaped, but that name is taken by a less appropriate tool.
