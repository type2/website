Subject: Re: [T2] battery terminals

Soccrplyr222222_at_aol_dot_com sends:

&gt; There are actually three places that &quot;gunk&quot; on the battery terminals can come
&gt; from.  The most likely is from the battery itself.  Especially if it is an
&gt; older battery.  The seals below the terminal posts go bad and allow some acid
&gt; to leak through.  Clean all you want and the stuff will still come back.
&gt; Second is from the terminals on your car itself.  Could be cheap aftermarket
&gt; with impurities in the lead that seem to attract all that mess.  Third, it
&gt; could be the environment your battery is in.  If it's humid and hot that just
&gt; speeds up the process.  Water or saltwater would make it even worse.  Some
&gt; people coat their terminals with petroleum jelly (Vaseline) or use special
&gt; paints that you can buy at any auto store.
&gt; 
&gt; Hope this has been helpful.

It has...thanks.

I always liked using plain old wheel bearing grease on battery terminals,
together with those little felt washers you put under the clamps. Put on the
washer, grease the post, hook up the clamp and put some grease on the clamp.
Works great.
