Subject: Hillman Fastener

Folks,

When I was in Austin I used to get most of my metric fasteners from Lowe's
because it was convenient.  Home Depot never had a good selection of machine
screws, bolts, etc and unfortunately this is also the case here where I live
in CA and there are no Lowe's to be found. I tried OSH but they have even
less than Home Depot.

Just before I moved I came across a local hardware store that stocked
Hillman Fasteners: an amazingly organized well stocked collection of metric
buts and bolts.  It was part of the DoItBest chain but I can't find a store
in the Bay Area.

Does anyone know which hardware chain in my area stocks Hillman Fasteners?
The Hillman site is down so I can't ask them for help.

Any other tips re: stores with great selections of metric hardware is also
appreciated.
