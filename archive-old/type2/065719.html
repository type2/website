&gt; 
&gt;       For the ThermoFluids System Design class I am taking,
&gt; the design group I am in has chosen to &quot;re-design&quot; the heating
&gt; system on the VW Bus.
&gt; 
&gt;       Hopefully what this means is that we will use our sub-par
&gt; heat transfer knowledge to improve the heating system by adding
&gt; insulation strategically, or fans, heatexchagners, etc.
&gt; 
&gt;       I mention this becuase we anticipate coming up with some
&gt; simple little improvements that will be of interest to all
&gt; Frozen bus owners.
&gt; 
&gt;       Also, if anyone has any specific info on the system as it exists,
&gt; I would appreciate it. I have the BA6 repair manual....
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks,
&gt; Matt.

Why not design an auxillary water heating system that heats water 
(connect up around the exhaust), Run through tubes up front into a heater 
core, and connect a fan to blow air through the heater core? Just a  
thought - water i s so much more efficient at transfer heat than air. You 
can add a bottle of Redline WaterWetter to the the water to improve the 
thermal efficiency of the water and also to help guard against corrosion.

Just my 2 cents!
