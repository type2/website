&gt; I'm considering converting the 2.0 l in my '74 from Weber
progressive to
&gt; fuel injection; and I have a couple of questions for the list.
&gt; 
&gt; What are the variations from year to year about?  Are there pros and
&gt; cons I should know about?  Are there advantages or disadvantages to be
&gt; had by mixing components from different years?
&gt; 
&gt; Also, for the return gas line, do I need to use the later two-nipple
gas
&gt; tank? or can I put a T-joint in the fuel line just below the nipple?
 (I
&gt; hesitate to weld on a second nipple.)

The idea of the return line is to prevent the fuel in the line from
getting too hot.  The fuel tank is used as a heat-sink.

Putting a &quot;T&quot; in the line would negate this function, as the fuel
would simply circulate.

If you really want to avoid welding on your tank (an excellent idea!),
then you might consider fabricating a &quot;special&quot; tee fitting with an
extension that runs the fuel return up through the fuel outlet.  There
probably is enough cross-sectional area in the outlet to allow both
functions to take place through one hole.
