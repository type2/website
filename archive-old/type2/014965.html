FYI:  A 1972 Westy with a carbureted engine and a good battery has no
trouble at all being driven 250+ miles without a working alternator so long
as other electrical items such as lights are not used.

Roconante's red &quot;ALT&quot; light came on near Mexico City where no parts were
available for repair.  Taking time to charge up the battery every time we
got gas was sufficient to get us all the way back home, 1,150 miles.  The
experience gives one a taste of what it might be like to drive an electric
vehicle: spending all that time around charging stations is for the birds!
