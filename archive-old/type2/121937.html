Subject: RE: [T2] 1600 T3 in a 78 Westy Q's

Has it been gone before... yes, if I'm not mistaken the brazilin Bay that is
still being made has a type 1 engine init, but...
My thought on this is unless you build the type 3/1 engine up for more horse
power &quot;properly&quot; you will be disappointed and it will broken down and find
yourself replacing that engine out on the road more then once, not to
mention that the type 1 engines are not as durable as a type 4.
If an engine is built properly and maintained and driven respectfully, there
is no reason why you should not get 100,000 reliable miles out of a type 4.
If you build Frankenstein engines you will be able to write hoarer story of
your advancers.
Build it properly and enjoy your bus!

Subject: [T2] 1600 T3 in a 78 Westy Q's


 ok... before the flames start... all Im tryin to
figure out is has anyone done this? I know a an
upright will go... with mods to the tin, and a few
other things...
 Reason I ask is theres a few T3 engines behind the
shop thats easily rebuilt.... already have everything
to do it:) But the main reason is this... space.
 Let me explain... after the little incident with the
1600 on the side of the road this weekend, I had alot
of time to think about things....right now the Westy
is gettin a engine put in it, a 2000 carbed.... man
that thing is heavy... not heavy as in &quot;wow man....
hes not heavy... hes my brother....&quot; heavy as in
lbs.... it took me dang near 2 days in the driveway
(dirt) to get that thing in there in the 78.... but a
1600 is so much lighter, and smaller (will get to
smaller in a sec)... 
 The Westy is gonna get either (1) a roof rack on the
front section (2)a front storage area in front of the
bus supported by the frame or (3) a rear storage rack
like the ones that use a reciever hitch type....
instead of carrying all the spares I need to repair
the 2000, just carry a bare minimum... but also have a
turn key 1600 strapped sumwhere:) with no fluids in it
you could stand it up on the flywheel and stash it
outa the way... heck... put the spare tire on the roof
rack, bolt the 1600 to the tire rack on the front...
hmmmm...
Anyways, back to the original question at hand....
lookin for info/help/pics of this swap....
 Got the flame suit on... know Ill need it... but Im a
die hard veeduber... I know this sounds crazy to most
folks, but a few years ago I made a trip to OK... dang
near to KS... all the spares/tools I carried weighed
more/took up more space than a complete engine would!!

 62 SC (the truck)
 78 Westy (the dead dudes bus)

ps... the reason for a T3 and not a T1 is for space
purposes... that doghouse is gonna get in the way as
far a storing it..... as far as the trouble I had last
weekend... already got a short block started to store
in the belly of the SC:)
