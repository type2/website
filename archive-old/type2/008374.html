One more thing I forgot:

Made sure that the grommet around the metal fuel tubing where it
passes through the front tin of the engine is present and in good
shape.  If it is missing, the tin will saw its way through the tubing
and your bus is toast.  Do whatever you have to do to prevent
metal-to-metal contact here!
