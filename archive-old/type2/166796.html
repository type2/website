Subject: Re: [T2] Problems with 78 after new points

I think you've got it! If it ran well before with the
old AFM, it will run well now, provided nothing
catastrophic &quot;just happened&quot; to it! Another thing to
consider when changing points is the *path to ground*,
meaning that the little ground strap between the
movable top plate and the distributor  body needs a
good ground, the distributor body needa a good ground
(should be okay when bolted in) and the contact
surface between the points and the plate they mount to
in the distributor needs to bee squeeky clean! Years
ago it was always emphasized that new points needed to
be cleaned with a strong solvent such as electrical
contact cleaner before installing. It was claimed that
they had an oil-film coating to preserve them in
storage and shipping. I know that some I have
installed without cleaning first did need it! -BaH

 After several more attempts I readjusted the points
 and am running a solid
 44-45 degree dwell.  I think initially my problem
 was that the rubbing block
 was not seated properly. The bus is now running
 again.  I also put my old AFM
 meter back in, because I keep stalling out.  I drove
 for over 1 hr  (in the
 mountains) with no problem's. (crossing my fingers).
  I do not own a gas
 spectrometer and suspect that because I made no
 adjustments to the FI that is
 why I keep stalling out after running for about 15
 minutes.  Sounded like it
 keep flooding out and would not restart till after
 the engine cooled.
