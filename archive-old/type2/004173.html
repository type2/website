Well, &quot;new person&quot; might be a little overboard, but I did buy my first VW
bus the other day in Mexico, and it feels pretty damn cool. After some
research I have found out that it is a 1974 Riviera with the &quot;penthouse&quot;
top. The inside of the van is fairly stripped out (no camping set up inside,
just the pop top). This leads me to my first question. Can anyone suggest
some parts catalogs I could get on the mailing lists of? Also, I have the
Haynes manual, but I see that there is an &quot;official&quot; Volkswagen service
manual, is that worth picking up? Looking forward to participating in the
list, thanks ahead for the answers!
