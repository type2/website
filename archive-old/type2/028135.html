They had those windows in 2 of the 3 recent junk buses last time I went to 
the yard, but how the hell do you get them out? any tips on what tools you 
should bring to get these out of there? They were un really good shape to, 
but ive never played around with pulling a window out of a car/van before.
If you tell me how to pull them out, I just might go there this weekend and 
pull all I can find for those who want 'em.

&gt; &gt; Hello All, I'm planning on putting slider windows in 74 bus.  Does 
&gt;anyone
&gt; &gt; know of a source to obtain these?
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Best bet is to find a late-70's bus in a junkyard; many came equipped with
&gt;sliders and they fit all years down to '68.
