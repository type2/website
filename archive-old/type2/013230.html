Subject: CV Boot replacement
Message-ID: &lt;20010511.071657.-147061.2.wilden1_at_juno_dot_com&gt;

I'm getting ready to perform a routine CV inspection and I'll be
replacing the boots when I clean and relube the CVs.
Last service was performed two years ago when I noticed that one of the
boots had cracks near the clamp on the axle,
The present boot is not leaking but I'm definately going to replace all
four boots.
I'd like to purchase a better quality boot for this go around if they are
available.
Anybody got a source for high quality CV boots?
In the past I've performed this service when the boots tore or cracked
and I've never had boots to last more than two years before they either
crack or tear.
