Subject: Cargo Floor Questions.......

Hello All,

I have a few questions about the cargo floor (you know, just behind the rear 
seat, made out of masonite and covered with a dense fabric) for my 7 
passenger 1970 Bus.  The PO placed fiberglass insulation under the masonite 
and then screwed the floor down.  This resulted in a very lumpy floor.
Question 1......._dot_can these lumps be removed from masonite by steaming or 
some such method?
Question 2.......in a stock set-up is the floor screwed down?  Or is this 
something the PO did when he put in the fiberglass insulation (I'm removing 
that stuff)
Question 3.......assuming the answer to Question 1 is &quot;no way&quot; and I have to 
make a new floor, what is the fabric which is glued to the masonite?
Question 4.......is this cargo floor available from any supplier?

Thanks all!

Mike
