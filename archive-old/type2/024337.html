Subject: Alternator or battery?
Message-ID: &lt;7kkarb$ev2n_at_eGroups_dot_com&gt;

My 1975 Westy runs well, when the battery is jumped.  It continues to run well after being jumped.  After being shut down for a couple of days the battery seems to be sluggish as the motor turns over hard and usually the battery dies after a couple of tries.  So, is it the battery or the alternator?  The battery is new, could it be that the battery does not have enough starting amps?  What starting amps are required to turn over a 1600 engine?

Thanks in advance, Scott
