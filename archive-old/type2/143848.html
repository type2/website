Subject: Re: [T2] Leaky Valve Covers

theres a technique to those *********......LOL...
i have found that if you pull down on the cover as you put the wire on and hold in place dont let it slide up  you will prevent leaks ....
they have to be on exactly right...
 
i use cork gaskets and always put a little sealent behind the gasket... thats between the cover and gasket not between gasket and head..... no no....
 
then set cover up there and hold in the down position as best as possible and then put wire bailer on easily without moving cover,,.,.,.,
 
also check to make sure that no one has bent the cover anywhere around the rim...
 
good luck.. once you get the technique you wont forget....
peace and love
chris
most folks use a pri bar or large screw driver for this but i try to use my hands until i have to barely slide the scrw driver under wire for final pop and on....

Hey,

I just got my new 69 on the road and she runs great! Worlds better than my 
71 ever did. However, I can not seem to get the valve cover from leaking. 

I have tried the old cork style, and the rubber rubber ones (twice) and they 
still leaking. I have threatened to weld them in place (kidding) . Any 
suggestions?
