Subject: Lonely Westy

Just got back from NashCon (historical gaming convention) in Nashville, and
while there we saw a westy in the &quot;Tow Zone&quot; area of the Sheraton Music City
Hotel parking lot.  It seemed in fairly good shape, though a bit dirty.
Looked as if it'd been there for at least a little while.  We hoped that it
did not belong to anyone from here.
