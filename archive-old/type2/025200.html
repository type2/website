Subject: Parts stores near Sacramento/SF bay area?

I've taking the HUGE dive (ass backwards, I may add) into probably
rebuilding my 78 2 liter engine (with hydraulic lifters).

I need parts. Buttloads of parts, like pushrod tubes and seals, pistons and
cylinders and rings, blah blah blah.

Where is there within, say, 150 miles of Sacramento that I can actually go
to and get parts easily and perhaps even inexpensively for this job? I don't
want to do mail order - I have three weeks of vacation right now, and I want
to get this done...

Thanks!
