Hi Gang-

My wife met a woman the other day (drawn like a moth to our bus) who 
rolled her '76 westy after her idiot mechanic forgot the cotter pin 
in the axle nut (and I guess didn't torque it well either).  Anyway, 
she has little to no money and needs a sliding door, right side 
mirror, and right rear window.  If anyone in Northern California has 
any parts to give away just do do someone a favor (or possibly for 
token monetary gain? I dunno, I'm the 2nd hand messenger), drop me a 
line....
