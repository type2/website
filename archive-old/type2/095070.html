Subject: Re: [T2] messy wiring


With a Bentley wiring schematic in hand.  Preferrably the colored version.  
It's a simple job if you take it a wire at a time.  Don't remove any wires, 
until you've looked them over for a few hours, and fell you comfortably know 
where the important ones go.  Use the fuse panel as a starting point, either 
from the battery, or to the accessories.  Feel the burn, enjoy the learn!

&gt;Hi there!
&gt;This is my first time to the list.  I have a huge mess of wires underneath
&gt;my steering wheel.  I haven't had my bus for long but I've been putting 
&gt;this
&gt;off because I know the headache it's going to be.  Does anyone have any
&gt;suggestions on how I should approach this mess?  Thanks
