Adam:
Original type 4 2 liter engines don't have counterweights. Is that what you
really mean, or is it a cast or welded California aftermarket crank?
I've never heard of a type 4 engine breaking a crank. 912 porsches would
sometimes break them, but the type 4 is a lot beefier. 912 engines were the
ultimate developement of the 25-36hp VW. same bore centers, etc. Porsches
used 36hp cases till 55 with their own heads. 912's had bigger main bearings
on the 2nd and 3rd journals and were counter weighted. I think they were a
little too hard and after a lot of miles, (60kto 100k) often would crack and
break.
If you have doubts about what you have, get me a picture. (Or John Anderson,
he's the best, or Dave Wolfanger).
This should NEVER have happened. I'd sure like to know why it did.
