Subject: Re: [T2] 'Tis The Season'--

&gt;&gt;I'm showing my love for my bus by pulling the engine due to a slight dizzy
&gt;&gt; mishap (Dad dropped the dizzy shaft spring into the engine block).
&gt;
&gt; Why don't you try draining your oil first?  Maybe the spring will wind up in
&gt; the drain pan.

Did that first thing. Pulled all the openings we could find, no avail.

&gt; or even a pushrod tube hole.  If the spring is resting on something other

Haven't tried the pushrod tube holes yet.

&gt; than the bottom of the sump, a squirt of compressed air into one of the
&gt; above openings might dislodge it.  With some persistance and creativity, you
&gt; should be able to avoid tearing down the block.

We'll probably spend alot of time doing that first. We didn't know if there
was room for the spring to work it's way out. I got the engine out this
morning. At least it'll be a little more accessible and I can straighten out a
few other nagging details while I'm at it (leaky transmission seal, exhaust
leak, oil pressure sender leak, etc.).

-Eric
