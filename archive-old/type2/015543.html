&gt;Hi,

&gt;I am so impressed with how easy it is to work on my van that I am 
&gt;considering a beetle as a daily driver.

Stephens Restorations in Anacortes, WA, will give you a new, old, T-I for
less than $10,000. Around here, you can find a candidate with solid chassis
and blown motor or with recent GEX junk motor for less than $3000. You put
another 3 to 5 thou as time/money in it as parts and labor and you can have
the most successful vehicle ever concieved by the master Neandereer
himself, Prof. Porsche!! But most certainly only if you follow his
philosophy, and if that's too much for you, just follow the instructions
per Bentley and monitor this list for info, and you will get Ferdinand's
most desired objective. Best suitability for transportion purposes for the
masses.

An absolute, unmitigated bargain compared to any current production for
personal transportation. No less so for the T-II when the purpose is
transport of larger loads.

You can have 2 of them for the price of one current downsized whatzit for
$20k. In a choice of a NEW Beattle or both an old T-I AND T-II properly
restored, the realities of value can be brought into perspective. If you
value Wizbang, buy the New Beattle. If you value efficacy, restore the best
candidates you can find in the T-I/T-II market. Your lifelong cost per mile
will love you for it. Economy over life was always a high criteria in every
design that came from his mind.
