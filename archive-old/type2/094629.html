Subject: Re: [T2] Kerosene:


Not to defuse a brewing flame war, but Auto Zone will take just about 
anything besides nuclear waste, no cost to you. There is a big tank back 
there by the overhead door, they'll show it to you and ask for your 
phone number, and some idea of what you're dumping on them.

There are now smallish generators built for the sole purpose of taking 
the offal from car maintenance, heating it up, and turning it into 
electricity. Co-generation; the utilities are required to buy the 
electricity back.

I hope that is what Auto Zone does with it. Can't say for sure.

&gt;&gt;     I use &quot;var-o-sol&quot; (check spelling) in my parts washer. I used to 
&gt;&gt; use kerosene, but I find it gets so nasty in everyday use. At any rate 
&gt;&gt; I buy them both from the local Exxon distributor (their the guys that 
&gt;&gt; sell the gas and oil to the service stations, so any brand will have 
&gt;&gt; it), there in the yellow pages under Oil Distributors. Another good 
&gt;&gt; thing, it costs less.
&gt;&gt;     For a one time use, get few gallons of Diesel fuel, not near the 
&gt;&gt; fire hazard as gas, and you can get anywhere, but its still nasty.
&gt;&gt;     One other thing, keep in mind where your going to dispose of what 
&gt;&gt; every you decide to use, any of it will be &quot;Hazardous waste&quot;. Don't 
&gt;&gt; get caught dumping it!
&gt;
&gt; Anything that I can't recycle easily gets poured over the &quot;bills&quot; and 
&gt; sticks that are in the burn barrel in the back yard. All goes away.
