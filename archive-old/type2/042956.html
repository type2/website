Subject: Wiper Woes

All,

I've got a '73 bus with a wiper problem.  Specifically, the POs never lubed 
the wiper shafts and over time they've seized and caused the bearing shafts 
to rotate with them.

I got a chance to view the carnage 2 weeks ago when I took the entire 
assembly apart.  The little keyways (nubs?) that orient the bearing shafts 
on the wiper armature bracket are long gone - in fact one of the round holes 
through which the bearing shaft passes is now an oval.

The bearing shafts aren't in the greatest shape either.  Prolonged contact 
with the sheetmetal of the bus has cut grooves through the bearing shafts 
into the metal of the wiper shafts.

My questions:

Has anyone had any luck using some sort of epoxy to hold the bearing shafts 
in place (to prevent them from rotating - a job once done by the keyway that 
has since been vaporized)?

Anyone know of a good source for bearing shafts?  I've seen Bug bearing 
shafts offered by RMMW, but never bus ones.

Anyone got a spare wiper armature they'd be willing to part with?  I don't 
need the wiper motor as mine checks out OK, nor would I need the arms that 
connect the motor to the wiper shafts.

Thanks for your help!

Scott
