Subject: in-dash fans for 68-78 bus 

I crossed the Rio yesterday to check on the fans...

211 959 113 C  Fan
959 511    Switch (In dash)

Valente, the partsman at the dealer in Nuevo Laredo
looked the part up on the computer and they are still
available. If anyone would like to order them, the
price quoted was 5400 pesos. I didn't bother to ask
for the price on the switch as I was in shock.
Yesterday the exchange rate was 9.30 pesos per
American Dollar. I'm going to buy another bus instead!
