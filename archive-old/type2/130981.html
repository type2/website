  help....

&gt;Checked the oil level lately?

Thanks for the response,I have not, got this one just over a week ago. 
Supposedly the prev owner drained/filled and I do believe him. This could 
mean it wasn't properly topped off?

I do have in the other room 3 things of Castrol gear oil so maybe I'll 
change it out this week while I'm doing about 280928292 other basic stuff.

Oh, and I think one of the reasons I kind of think it's cool is that my 
grandmothers 57 chevy made a similiar noise and it just brings back fond 
memories.
