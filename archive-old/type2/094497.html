Subject: Re: [T2] fuse block info needed

[...]
Problem is i need the back side of the fuse panel.  The bently gives the 
numbering etc. which is needed to tell which pin to connect to.  but the 
box isnt numbered.  Will have to do it the hard way probably.

&gt; I think the fuses are labelled S1 through S-something. Also at the 
&gt; bottom of the page the fuse panel is pictured showing visually which 
&gt; fuse handles a particular circuit.
