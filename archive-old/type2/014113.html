Subject: Re: [T2] Where's Mike West?

&gt; Where the heck did Mike West get to? He was an awesome resource, and 
&gt; had the
&gt; neatest ways to get things done.He had a great writing style and I have 
&gt; his
&gt; posts all stored somewhere. :-)

Mike West died quite some time ago. He was old and very sick. We 
sleuthed up his obituary one night on IRC (that sounds morbid and 
callous but nobody quite knew what had happened to him, and there's 
really only one way to settle a question like that--Raistrick knew he'd 
been badly ill).

He had cancer but I think the cause of death was heart failure, he died 
in a nursing home in Oregon. Some small town near Grant's Pass I think. 
There was nothing to suggest that he left any family.

Regretfully,

--Hoop
