&quot;It might be that spinning the fan faster won't flow more air.  If the flow
is already &quot;choked&quot; with the stock fan pulley spinning it faster won't
make any difference.  If you have a way to measure air flow it would be
easy to determine by plotting air flow versus engine RPM.  If the curve
still has positive slope at 5000 engine RPM then spinning the fan faster
would be effective, but if the curve flattens out it would just cause
problems.&quot;

	Its relativly easy to measure the air PRESSURE in the fan shroud, but 
this is only proportional to flow, not the same as. But its a start. If
you plot pressure versus RPM, if the curve is smooth then its a good
bet, though not certain, that more RPM will give more pressure and that
in turn will give more flow. It may be that the flow is already choking
at 1000rpm, of course, in which case more rpm just raises pressure without
raising flow.
	If the graph of pressure versus rpm rises more steeply at a point,
its a good guess that flow is choking at that point.

	4 or 5 points, idle, idle + 1000 rpm, +2000 rpm, etc are what you need
to measure. 

	To measure air pressure, use two pieces of glass tubing with
a short bit of rubber hose connecting them. Fasten them to a piece of
cardboard, wood, steel, whatever, that can be stood up straight. Put a
ruler against one glass tube to measure the height of the water. Fill
with water, with some food dye added to make it easy to read. Fill
the setup so the top of the water is about in the middle of the ruler.
Hook a piece of rubber hose to the top of one glass tube and tuck it into 
a fresh air hose that go to the heat exchangers or pick some other way
of getting it into the high pressure side.
	With the engine running, the water in the glass tube with the
rubber hose going to the shroud will go down, the water in the glass tube
open to the air will go up. By equal amounts if the tubes are the same
diameter (home inventors can figure out how to make higher resolution versions
using different sizes of glass tubing...)

	This instrument measure inches or millimeters of water pressure
difference. To convert to atmosphereic pressure, remember that sea level
pressure is 14.7lb/square inch. Figure out how tall a column of water
must be to wiegh 14.7lb...

	I built one of these while trouble shooting a home air conditioner,
it gave me about 1/2 inch (12mm) of water pressure rise on the exhaust
size of its fan. I'd expect a VW at 3000rpm above idle to give MUCH more!
