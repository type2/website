Subject: Re: [T2] Bus in the 4th of July parade

&gt; &gt; I am going to have my Bus pulling a float (farm wagon that can be
&gt; &gt; pulled by one person so isn't to heavy) in a parade and was wondering
&gt; &gt; if the List could give me some advice (besides not to do it) on
&gt; &gt; keeping my engine cool.  Of course it will be hot that day and I will
&gt; &gt; be going at idle speed.
&gt;
&gt; I drove mine in a parade once and wasn't towing anything, it is as you
&gt; suspect quite hard on the engine cooling.

I dont see why. I can sit in 90+ degrees in rush hour traffic and temps
are maybe 190. I just dont see vws overheating fron too slow conditions
like water pumpers.
