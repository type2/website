Subject: Fuel Pump Relay Testing

Hey Chuck,

I just performed the air vane test with the ignition on and the fuel pump 
did not run. So there is the problem. I also disconnected the fuel injector 
signals just for fun and as expected the van only ran a couple of seconds 
and died. Therefore we ca conclude that injectors are not the problem.

Now to test it further I traced the two fuel pump wires to a relay in the 
back of the engine compartment. I found the fuel pump signal and connected a 
solid 12 V from the battery. The pump worked. So it's not the pump that's 
dead. I have disconnected the relay. It's the one that has two 6 pin sockets 
connected to it. Now I need to find out what are the terminal connections 
and test it. Do you have any clue of what they would be? I have not been 
able to find it in my Haynes manual.

Anybody know this info?

Also remember the test that I did on the air sensor. I had found that all 
the impedance values were good. So can it really be anything else that the 
relay? Is there anything mechanical that could cause the sensor to 
malfunction and not be detected electronically.

Thanks,

Matt
