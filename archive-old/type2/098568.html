&gt; Not so George--not just Kewl--but when used in Semis ( this is where
&gt; they originated back in the 50's) they kept the light down on the road
&gt; instead of in oncoming automobile motorist's faces a night.

In order to block glare for oncoming drivers, these &quot;eyebrows&quot; would
have to extend several feet in front of the light, as the oncoming driver
is only a couple of degrees from the central axis of the beam.  The
truckers may have claimed that the eyebrows reduced glare, but the fact
is that they were decorative.

Off-roaders with roof mounted lights put long shields on the bottom of
their roof-mounted lights to prevent the lights from illuminating the
hood.  The hood is at a much larger angle from the axis of the light
beam, but they still need a foot or two of light shield to do the job.
