&gt;What it would entail is an A-B-C type of checklist like soem of the 
&gt;great stuff I got yesterday off list.  Maybe some diagrams and looks at 
&gt;different CA mods.  I was lucky, my bus left Germany bound for CA so it 
&gt;had everything.  Not everyone is that lucky.

I think I'm going to break down an buy a wide band AFR meter and test the bus as scientifically as I can to determine the effect of the various components and workarounds on the exhaust mixture. I should have something to report in a few weeks as I count down my registration deadline.

&gt;Second unrelated question:  Engine rebuilds and R&amp;R's (remove and 
&gt;replace).  Ot erh than Muir, is there something in the archives of a 
&gt;list of what I could buy today at my local FLAPS (ie Kragen/Checker/Pep 
&gt;BOys) to be ready for this job?

Very little these days. In fact less and less as each day goes by. I'd stick with the online vendors that support the list.
