Subject: fuel filler pipe #2

     I have the fuel filler pipe out.  I got it out by cutting the old hose
off.  Now, I can't get the new pipe back together.  If I put the hose back
on the pipe before I place it in position, the pipe will not fit in the
access hole.  If I try to put just the pipe in then put the hose on, It will
not fit on.  This is a major PITA.  I am stuck.  Any ideas?
