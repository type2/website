I am looking for someone nice enough to sell me a copy of their parts
manual.  If you have any of the manuals, either for bus or bug, what would
it take for you to drop it off at a quick copy place, then send me the
repo.  There are a number of us who would like copies of the various
manuals, so while at the copy place, you might just have them run off a
number at one time.

I do not know how many pages are in a manual, but we are willing to pay for
your trouble, the cost of reproducing and mailing.

a 72 edition of the beetle manual (thick book) took two people hours and hours
and cost about  $88 for one copy.   No auto feed- old yellowed original paper.
Then again  most books are smaller.
