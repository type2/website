Subject: Gas valve / regulator  --- Blinker short

Does anyone know where I can find the gas valve and pressure regulator for a 
77 Westy. The tank is fine, but everything after that is trashed. The valve 
has been broken off. I've seen them for newer models. I've gone to home 
depot and they have almost nothing.

Also when I turn on my left blinker both the blinker and the brake light 
blink, but both very dully (if that's a word). I've checked the assembly and 
everything is clean. Where do I go from there in searching for a short?
