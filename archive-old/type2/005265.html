Hello list,

    I have been reading with interest lately a lot of discussion about brake
problems of one type or another. The topics have been the usual, &quot;pulling&quot;
brakes, low or no peddle, &quot;locked up&quot; wheels, etc. The suggested fixes have
been right on for the most part.
    One thing happened that bothered me though. I ask someone the procedure
he used to adjust his brakes. He didn't answer. This wasn't dome to insult
anyone, I just though it may have been contributing to the problem.
    Maybe some people don't understand the relationship between having all
the slack out of the wheel cylinders, and brake shoes. To having air in the
system. As you apply the brakes there is only so much travel in the master
cylinders piston stroke, thus moving the fluid through the lines/wheel
cylinder, etc. If the slack isn't taken up by proper adjustment, you waste
all or part of that movement. So you can bleed brakes until the chickens
come home and still think you have air in the lines. The peddle wont firm up
as you &quot;pump&quot; the brakes. Although, if you pump fast enough, you take up
that slack by &quot;piling&quot; the fluid in the system before the pistons can return
it, but the next time you apply the brakes, you have no peddle, or &quot;slack&quot;.
    When in reality by neglecting the importance of proper adjustment of the
brake shoes and hand brake cables, you have caused your dilemma.
     So I thought I would suggest one sure way anyone can, get a good start
to a good stop! I have adjusted brakes this way so long I don't remember who
or were I learned to do it this way.
    After all necessary repairs have been made, including making sure
nothing is leaking, flex hose's replaced, drums true, wheel bearings
adjusted properly. In general when the system is mechanically sound, the
next step is adjustment, right?

    I am using a Type One, four wheel drum brakes car as an example. These
rules will apply to all Volkswagens, and drum brakes in general. Early Type
Two's with separate front wheel cylinders work and adjust the same, just two
wheel cylinders per, but they are much more sensitive to adjustment and hose
problems. On cars and Bus's with disk front brakes, service the rear the
same way.

1) All parts &quot;CLEAN ENOUGH TO EAT OFF OF&quot;! Never blow compressed air on dry
brake parts. Even though Asbestos has been outlawed long ago, there may be
some still around. Buy a $2.00 can of &quot;spray brake cleaner&quot;, Use a stiff
brush and wash everything down, wetting all the dry dust before any
compressed air is used!

2) Make sure the adjuster screws free enough to turn by hand all the way in
and out, and the hub is free in the mounting holes, and that none of locking
spring clips are not broken! Take your &quot;freed up&quot; adjusters and apply a
light coat of anti-sez on the threads, and in the mounting holes. Make sure
the angled &quot;slot&quot; in the adjustment screw head is orientated to the angle on
the end of the brake shoe. Different years have different angles, if they
don't match you have the wrong shoes, or adjustment screws.

3) Closely inspect your brake hardware, check for things like return springs
close to braking on the hook ends. Check the &quot;C&quot; clip that holds the hand
brake leaver to the shoe for cracks and fit. Check the shoe retaining pins
and cups for wear, the slots in the cups have a habit of pulling through 20
miles after the job is finished, and wiping out everything in that wheel,
including the drum. $100.00 plus repair for a $ 00.10 part.

4) Make sure the contour of the shoe matches the drums fairly well. At one
time you could have your shoes ground to fit the drums. Because of
asbestoses I don't think anyone should do this any more. Your machinist
should have checked the drums for ware, but you never know. The idea is that
if your drums have been turned (machined) to much, or are worn past there
limit, the contours wont match and only part of the shoe friction surface
will hit the drum.

5) Front brakes: Take a rasp or heavy file and cut a 45' bevel, 1/4 inch
wide across both end edges of each brake shoe friction surface front and
rear (this will help to keep the shoes from grabbing). Install the shoes
using a very small dab of brake lube on the ends of the shoes where they fit
in the wheel cylinders, and in the adjustment screws. Also lube the backing
plate where the shoes make contact. Install the heaver of the return springs
closest to the wheel cylinder, the lighter one goes to the adjustment end.
Make sure the brake shoe retaining springs (the ones that the pins fit
through) haven't lost there tension. Clean any hand prints from all friction
surface's with your spray can of brake clean. Repack wheel bearings, replace
the seal, install the drum, adjust wheel bearing as per Bentley Manuel,
depending on ball or taper bearings.

6) Rear brakes: Now is when you should replace the axel seal, so it doesn't
ruin your new brakes. Look closely at the shoes, check contour, and bevel as
above, make sure they are the same width as the old shoes and that the width
is right for the drums. Compare the length of the friction surface (the
actual contact surface) of the two shoes. If one is longer it is the primary
shoe, and will go to the rear of the car. Using a new (if possible) clip,
install the hand brake actuator lever on the front shoe. Making sure you
place it on the proper side depending on which side of the car your working
on. Lube the shoes and all other moving parts at the contact points, as with
the front shoes. Clean all hand prints as before. Install the drum, torque
axel nut to specifications (318 ft lb's although some manuals say 336 ft
lb's, if you get that close it will work, better that a crescent wrench and
cheater pipe, don't laugh, you have done it!), install a new cotter pin.

7) Hand brake: Inside the car, loosen both hand brake cables until there is
plenty of slack.

Now! Lets adjust the brakes!

8) Start at any wheel, any adjuster. Turn the adjustment &quot;star&quot;, spreading
its shoe, all the while turning the wheel back and forth to seat the shoes,
until the wheel locks up tight! Back off the star one &quot;click&quot; at a time
until the wheel will turn slightly. &quot;Then back off the adjuster THREE more
clicks&quot;. At this point your wheel should be free, it may make a slight
rubbing noise, but don't be concerned. Now move to the other adjustment star
on this wheel, and adjust the same way.
    Follow this procedure on the remaining wheels.
    Move inside the car, and adjust the hand brake cables one side at a
time, until the handle will only come up &quot;THREE&quot; clicks, tighten the lock
nuts.

9) Time for the road test.
    Before getting on the road, check the brakes, do you have a full, firm,
peddle? Do they release when you take your foot off? If all seems well, at a
very slow speed, in the drive way, check the brakes stopping function,
including the hand brake!
    All still seem ok?
    Then, pick a road with no traffic, and while driving slowly about twenty
MPH or so, gently apply the brakes until stopped several times, going
forward and in reverse. Not hard, not going fast, just enough to wear them
in, and let them get hot a few times. DO NOT OVER HEAT THEM!

10) Now take the car back to the shop, lift it up and look everything over
very closely for, leaks, anything loose, any missing bolts, parts, etc.
While you did all of your quality control work the brakes have had a chance
to cool down, so..... Its time to readjust them all, including the hand
brake if necessary!
    Finally, don't do any high speed, long duration stops for a first few
hundred miles. Apply on and off as much as you can, let them seat in, and go
through several heat/cool cycles before any real hard braking. Keep them
adjusted every 3000 k miles and you won't have to do this very often!


    Well, again, this wasn't meant to insult anyone, just my long winded
opinion.
    Does this all sound like over kill? I don't know, but seems like the
&quot;key&quot; word there was KILL!
    I know it sounds like a lot of extra work, but after you do a few like
this it will become much faster, almost like second nature. Your brakes will
last longer, stop straighter. And most of all, I may be on the HWY, and meet
you at a high speed cross road, and &quot;YOU&quot; will be able to stop! Thus saving
my bacon!!!!   :-) :-)
