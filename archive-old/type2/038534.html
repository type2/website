Subject: Re: Helpful Hints on Keeping exhaust system Less Rusty!!

adam: i am a powdercoater. i have a product for this job.
the muffler must be sandblasted and coated w/ a silicon-
based powder rated 1000 Deg. F., which is baked on at 
400 Deg. F. this material has been successful on brake
drums also. you may p-mail me for your needs, but my
server is about to go down for the weekend and i may not
surface until monday. 

rust never sleeps !!!
