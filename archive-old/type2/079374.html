&gt; Illustrated on Page &amp; Frame 94-10, of the Official 1968~79 VW Type 2,
&gt; Replacement Parts Catalogue &amp; Microfiche, is a special Ignition Coil, (Item
&gt; No. 2) with three water-proof gland connections, for the both the LT and HT
&gt; leads, plus ignition distributor, leads and other components with matching
&gt; connection fittings.
&gt;
&gt; I possess the ignition coil and one matching lead (length 275mm, 10.75
&gt; inches), having the following part numbers.
&gt;
&gt; Ignition coil (Item 2) - VW Part No. 122 905 115 D
&gt;                        - Bosch Part No. 0 221 107 001
&gt;
&gt; Matching lead (Item 25 ?) - VW Part No. 181 905 721
&gt;                           - Bosch Part No. 0 290 320 009
&gt;
&gt; Which VW Type 2s were they intended for?

I'd expect it is a military application.  The lead number staring in -181
is a Thing part as I recall, and Things were originally intended for the
military..

I know that my '71 has a different coil specified than the beetle of the
same year.  I've no idea of the difference except that the Bus coil is a
few dollars more.  Perhaps it has more turns to make up for the longer
ignition circuit.  This &quot;bus coil&quot; had normal connections.

&gt; &gt; I noticed something similar, fitted to the old NATO mobile field gun
&gt; manouevering units (featured in VW Motoring magazine, some years ago), which
&gt; had a VW Type 4 industrial engine.

More evidence of a military connection.
