Subject: '73 Transporter for Sale!!!

Well, I tried. But my landlord made the final decision
for me. No more bus on his Property. 


$450 includes
The good things:
Brand new Pistons and rings
Brand new cylinders
All new gaskets 
New Rotor, Points, Cap, and Plug wires
New Bosch Plugs (in engine) plus four extra
Comes with Four Jack stands, hydraulic Jack,
Compression tester, Battery Charger (New Battery) New
Hoses, After market electric fuel pump
Both rear seats and seat belts in good condition 
Interior is great 
All lights and stereo with front and rear speakers
working.
Two copies of John Muir's Book: One Clean one Dirty
One copy of the Haynes manual.

The bad:
doesn't run right now. 
Rust holes on the left and right bottom near the rear
wheel. 
Carbs need rebuilding.
A few oil leaks.


Here is the deal. I took on this project giving myself
two and a half months to get this thing running. My
landlord was hesitant but let me do it anyhow. I had
never done anything this big. I am a bicycle mechanic
by profession but thought that it might be a fun
project. It was fun in a lot of ways but it really has
just turned out to be too much for me (and my
landlord). I put the new cyclinders and pistons and
all new gaskets in. I relapped the valves in the heads
and put the whole thing back together and then put the
engine back in three days ago and started her up. She
dumped oil out of the left side at the head. I about
cried. When I told my landlord that I was going to
have to drop the engine again to see what was going on
he about lost it and told me that I had ten days to
get it running or off his property. All I want to do
is cover my parts cost and have this car go to a good
home. call or write. If interested I'll get you some
pictures.
