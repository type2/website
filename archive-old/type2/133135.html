Chris,

Bill of sale and signed title should get you home just fine....

The $5.00 plate is probably worth it as it can go in the back window and 
prove you were trying to be &quot;legal&quot;....and give any cops the opportunity 
to see that it is a vehicle &quot;in transit&quot;...also, it's not like it's a 
$200,000 Lamborgini driving around without plates across state lines.

I did this last year with a Kansas car and we did just what you described.
Left the plates on and then I mailed them back when I got home.

Call your insurance agent before you leave and let them know what the deal 
is....they will probably want a VIN number.


Cheers, dave
