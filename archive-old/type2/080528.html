Subject: DC Canopy saga

I picked up my 1960DC with the new Canopy--It is VWonderful and a great
price- If you recall I went to a place that did not feel &quot;comfortable&quot;?,
with VWs-  But they said they would do it for me--Well, they kept stalling
around on my truck. --So I took the DC to another place in Phoenix,
Apache Awning 602-273-0254. Owners name is Einar, and he lokes VWs and is a
very cool biker,--he finished the job in less then a week--And it was even
Cheaper then the 1st place I went to--No, it is not 100% correct!
 But I like it, and it is the finest material available--If you want a great
deal and live near Phoenix, give Einar a call, and talk to him about a
Canopy, Single or Double cab style.

 &quot;Rudy&quot; our 1960DC with his new canopy will be at BBB VI-
Lady Magoo will also have another of her Bus Blankets like the one at Jerome
Jamboree, up for auction, with all proceeds going to charity.
--Enjoy ,uj
