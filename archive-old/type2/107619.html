Subject: '74 Auto Tranny in NH

Hello Volks,

Anyone looking for an auto-tranny for a '73/'74 in the New England area?  A
friend of mine is getting pressure to get his '74 parts bus out of the yard
and wants to get the tranny to a good home before it is towed off.  The
tranny is complete with all linkage and associated parts (it's still in the
bus at the moment).  Let me know if you are interested and I we can work out
the details.

Cool Runnings,
Jay Brown
