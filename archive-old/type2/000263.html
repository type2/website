Subject: timing 009 (the truth please)

I have searched the archives and can not get a straight answer on this.
I have a 009 distributor and would like to set the timing.  In archives I
see anywhere from 5 atdc to 15 btdc at idle and 25 btdc to 32 btdc at 2500
to 3500 rpm.  Does anyone out there have the correct timing?  I know &quot;THE
TRUTH IS OUT THERE&quot; so please let me in out it.
