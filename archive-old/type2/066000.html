Subject: Message size limits...

 
There seems to be a little resentment over the BA-6 heater article I
wouldn't post, so a quick explanation. If there's still discussing to be
done after that, please send it to me, don't post it to the list, because
it's off-topic. The list is about busses, it isn't about itself.

There's a 15K limit on messages posted to the list. Any bigger than that
and the software will intercept it and bounce it out. While this has the
collateral effect of preventing people from posting binaries or quoting
entire digests (it happens sometimes), the primary reason for it is to try
to keep the signal-to-noise ratio high around here.

IMO a 30K message shouldn't be broadcast, it should be made available for
interested people to seek it out. That's why there's ftp, and anybody who
can email can ftp as well. I've offered Mr. Anderson free ftp space for
the article if he needs it.

The whole bandwidth thing is worrying me a little bit--not because of the
expense or because I mind running a list with this much traffic, but
because there's a point where an information resource becomes useless as
an information resource because there's too much of it. The day we split
v_at_l in July, we had 360 subscribers. We'll hit 460 this Friday if we
aren't there already.

So if we could all tighten up on the bandwidth a little, particularly on
the off-topic stuff, that would be good.

Thanks,
