Subject: [T2] Bus won't start

Volks,
    I have done all of the suggested ignition checks and vacuum hose checks
I can think of.  The bus turns over and starts but will not idle.  I have
extensively read my Bentley and my Muir books as well as the library and I
am out of ideas so I turn to you.  My bus is fuel injected and I have
recently done a full tune up.  (not on the FI though)  I now turn to you for
the answers.  Thank you much.
Dave
P.S. ( the bus got me to Alaska with no problems so I owe it one)
