Hi Ron!
Re your 78 valve cover gaskets leaking from an install- it's very easy
for the cover to ride up on the head and displace the gasket when you
snap up the clip- first, grease the area where the clip rubs against. If
the gasket is malformed from being stuffed somewhere, you may have to
use silicone or other adhesive to hold it in the cover lip (I've used a
bit of grease to hold a good gasket in place while tipping the cover in
place), but never put adhesive on the head side!  Second, hold the cover
when you place it over the head- move it around; you can feel when it's
centered over the head; the lip is narrow, less than 1/4&quot;.  While
holding the cover with one hand, move up the clip until you feel tension
but it's not in place.  Walk it up the rest of the way by prying up with
a screwdriver (a brake adjusting tool is perfect- has the right bend in
it) or you can tap it with a hammer.  The heater box is in the way, and
I have at times (for a stubborn cover) wedged a piece of board (1&quot; as I
recall) above the cover and held it there while riding up the clip.  Now
the most important part- run it while watching (lay a brick on the gas
pedal so it's about 2500-3000 rpm's) and check for leaks!  BTW, a claw
hammer is great for removing the clip. To remove a stubborn cover, tap
on each end with a hammer to loosen it.
