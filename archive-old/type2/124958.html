Subject: Re: [T2] 15&quot; inch wheels - what tire size do you run

Chris,

I'm running BF Goodrich M+S Touring T/A 205/70R15 on my stock '74 Oz 
Campmobile without any rubbing issues.

FWIW

&gt; Okay, I've got a set of 15 inch wheels on their way here. What size do you 
&gt; run? I saw a bus on BajaBus that was running 205/75/R15 which looked GREAT 
&gt; but I am concerned about rubbing. Would happily go down to 205/65/R15 if 
&gt; necessary. MY CR-V uses 205/65/R15 stock and I am running 205/75/R15 with 
&gt; excellent results. Looks right, feels good, handles fine. Michelin tires. 
&gt; I LOVE my Michelin tires (as compared to the Bridgestones I had before) 
&gt; which wore out quickly, rumbled alot, and shook b/c I think 2 or 3 of them 
&gt; had broken belts inside. I wore out two sets in 85K miles. Thanks!
&gt;
