Hmm, got the book (of course) &amp; have read most of it. Good fun to read
etc... Not impressed when I tried to adjust my choke!

Now if, as is apparently the case, some vital &amp;/or fatal mistakes have been
made in the book. What are they? If &quot;newbies&quot; are using this book as a
guide, then any mistakes should be made known. I'm not &quot;Muir bashing&quot;, I
think the book is excellent, but what should I ignore?

 Based on my '76 1600 dp

 I don't mean his opinion's or the 009 fiasco.
