Subject: wheel

The wheels went right on thank you all for the help.  The 71 is has the Mercedes wheel on it now looks ok.  The guy I got the diesel from drove it SF Bay to St. Louis with those wheel &amp; light duty tires on it.  This is a full pop top wsety with he &amp; his mother &amp; father in it.

So from the diesel is good it does not have the top end of the 71 but makes up for in torque.  It likes 55 tops out &amp; 60 but will hold 50 in a clime. It's the 1.6  47hp.
does have an oil leak &amp; I think the master cylinder is going fluid _at_ my feet.
I will keep you all posted. If anyone is looking for a 71 dope me a line.

Thank you,

Chris Jackson
