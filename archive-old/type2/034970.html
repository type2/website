Could well be, yes.

&gt;What would happen if I took the
&gt;wire off while the motor was running?

The motor should stumble, and possibly die.  RPMs should drop.  All that
good stuff.  If none of that happens, unscrew it a teensy bit while the
engine is running and see if the RPMs pick up.  Or remove it, look at the
little hole in the end and see if it's plugged.  Blow it out with
compressed air if you can.  See if you hear a click when you
connect/disconnect the wire with the key on.
