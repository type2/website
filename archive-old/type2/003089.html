I have been trying to reach Mrs. Berg who is the person who gives the nod
for a group discount.

There has been interest for various shifters, so I will try to get her to
give us an open time frame (like 6 weeks) to call and order using a special
code or something for the discount.  I also will suggest that listees may
want to get one for their beetle, etc.

I will keep the list posted.
