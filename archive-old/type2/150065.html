I'll weigh in on this discussion, I use the Hazet ring band type ring
compressor that is adjustable, it will do any size piston you will ever need
to do unless you are building giant truck engines. It is the tool you see in
some of the VW manuals.

http://www.mansew_dot_com/images/HAZET/PISTON-RING-COMPRESSOR.htm

I have assembled the pistons both ways, putting piston inside cylinder, then
mounting that whole business on the rod, or putting pistons onto rods, then
sliding cylinders onto rods.

I find for me that the latter method works best. I don't like handling the
cylinder/piston assembly as a unit while having to drive the pin into the
rod - I find it a bit unwieldy. On a type 4 a few of the pistons are already
difficult to install due to the case design and having the cylinder around
the piston while you are trying to get the pin into the rod makes is more
difficult.

In order to do it the VW manual method - install the cylinder onto the
mounted piston - you need a narrow band compressor that will open up easily.
The hazet works perfectly for this and was probably designed specifically
for these engines. There are other band type that use pliers and bunch of
different size rings, they work fine but I like the simplicity of the hazet
design where it is one tool, not a box full.

If you find the hazet a bit pricey you can use an inexpensive Lisle
wrinkle-band ring compressor which works very well for about 15% of the
money.
