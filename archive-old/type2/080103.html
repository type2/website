Subject: '73+ to '72 Front beam compatibility -Need a quick answer!

Hi All,

I've looked through the archives and the tech library and found some =
good info (Thanks to Steve Dolan), but no definitive answer: Are 1973 =
and later front beams direct swap in replacements for a 1972 front beam. =
(I realize there are larger calipers on the 73 and later beams, but what =
I need to know is: Will it fit, Will the steering connect/work, Are =
there any other suspension related issues, etc.=20
I'm assuming that 73-79 beams are identical....I know- &quot;When you =
assume...&quot;  ;-)

Or are there any other year related isues to watch out for?

I've got a chance at a complete '76 beam but I need to know if it is =
worth the effort of pulling it. Thanks in advance for a quick response.

John B.
