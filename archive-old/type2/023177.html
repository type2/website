X-Diagnostic: MESSAGE MAY NOT BE TOPICAL - S

for the second time, i discovered wet areas in the bus.  i was frustrated, 
but i guess i'm just getting used to it.  this time, the insulation i had 
put in the walls had become wet in the small wall panel by the rear wheel 
well.  the older water marks down the wood panel should have tipped me off 
in the first place i guess!  anyway, all is dry after the 87 degree day we 
had here in virginia yesterday.

and, i did a &quot;the bus didn't leak anymore&quot; dance this morning after i 
checked it after the huge wind/thunderstorm we had last night!

it was depressing when everything...insulation and carpet...had become wet, 
but i'm glad it happened now instead of later when i have the full interior 
reinstalled!

thanks to everyone for their support!
