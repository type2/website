Subject: Re: [T2] stock compression ratio

[...]

&gt; for my 1979 2.0 Liter engine. What I cannot stumble across is what the
&gt; stock CR for this particular engine is actually. if anyone knows off
&gt; the top of their heads, I'd appreciate it.
 
GD and GE engines are 7.3:1
Here is one web source:

However, do not believe the GE as being 79 Calif only..... Wrong!!
