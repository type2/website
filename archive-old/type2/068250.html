Subject: Lobro CV Boot Kit Mystery Part

I just installed (2) Lobro brand boot kits and (2) Meisterstatz boot 
kits.  Interesting differences between kits.

Each contained a boot, 6 bolts, axle shaft end circlip, &amp; a tube of grease.
Some differences however:
Boot clamp for small diameter, Lobro-yes, Meisterstatz-no
Washers for (6) bolts, Lobro-no, Meisterstatz-yes
May not need clamp, but certainly need washers, why would Lobro 
leave them out?  Had to use old ones.
Lobro also included a mystery washer.  Large enough to fit over the 
axle shaft, not flat, angled relative to center, no determined 
function.  Just a thought, against the CV, inside of the circlip?
My instruction manuals don't show one.

Lobro's instructions were interesting, though totally irrelevant to 
the parts supplied (see, some of us read the directions, nyaa)
They showed a nifty (probably older) kit that had a metal cover for 
the non-axle end of the CV that would contain the grease during 
installation.  On the inner side, the part I received was one piece 
metal attached to the rubber boot.  In the instructions they were 
separate parts, allowing one to fill the metal part with grease, and 
then affix the boot over it and clamp rubber onto the metal.

I can see, however, that it would be more expensive, as it had more 
parts, but sooo much cleaner.  

Well written and illustrated instructions though. (I write instructions at 
work, for use at work, so no danger of any of you having to read mine!)
