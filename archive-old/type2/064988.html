&gt; I called my local machine shop to inquire about the price of grinding and 
&gt; perhaps balancing my crank. I've read Bob Hoover's sermons on balancing and 
&gt; know enough to say I want the entire reciprocating deal balanced as a 
&gt; unit--crank, pulley, flywheel, pressure plate, etc.
&gt; 
&gt; So the guy (a jerk, by the way..is this endemic to people who work in 
&gt; machine shops? he asked, donning flameproof suit) says I'm now looking at 
&gt; having an ASSEMBLY balanced, and that the price goes up accordingly. Not 
&gt; only must I balance the aforementioned parts, but I've got to bring him the 
&gt; connecting rods, bearings, pistons, rings, etc. ad nauseum. Why must I bring 
&gt; these parts, I ask, if they are not going to be actually ATTACHED to the 
&gt; crank at the time of balancing? Why can't I get the rods balanced as a set, 
&gt; the pistons balanced as a set, the crank as a unit, etc. He tells me, and I 
&gt; quote, &quot;We have to know the weight of the rods, bearings, pistons, rings&quot; 
&gt; blah, blah, blah.
&gt; 
&gt; This makes no sense to me. So I've brought the matter to the All Wise and 
&gt; Knowing List. This ain't gonna be no racin' engine, I just want it to run 
&gt; long and smooooooth. I don't want some fast-talkin' machine dude building me 
&gt; a formula vee engine or something of the sort.

 Wellll... 
  as far as i understand to balance the WHOLE ASSEMBLY you have to give 
him the crank and everythiong attached to it. The rods, and pistons move 
along with the crank, so the pistons and rods must be balanced on the 
crank...

     At least thats how i understand it....
