Edson, Larry OCH sends:

&gt; Last night someone, on another elist I'm on, mentioned that there is a
&gt; battery available (used by the hot rod crowd) that has 3 poles -- common
&gt; ground, 6v hot, &amp; 12v hot.  I have no idea who makes them or where to get
&gt; them but they are reported to cost a bit over $100.  So if you have a six
&gt; volt system and don't want to convert everything over to 12 volt, you can
&gt; have the best of both worlds.

You'd still have to change the generator and the voltage regulator--if
you've got a 12v battery, you have to charge it with 12v.
