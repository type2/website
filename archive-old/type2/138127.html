The list admins must be nappin' in their campers through this thread, 
which got political on about the second reply.

I've been watching the politics on the list closely for many months 
now. There is a subcurrent of blue state/red state rivalry here that 
piques my interest. But I kind of wish it would stop. Blue state/red 
state is a figment of the imaginations of political commentators, not a 
reflection of reality (my county is redder than most red states, and 
it's in the midst of &quot;blue&quot; California). And besides -- we all have 
twenty-five to thirty-five year-old quasi-subversive vehicles on this 
list which makes us all more like sage green than red or blue.

There are no Yankees on this list, or bubbas for that matter. Just 
folks who are too poor to own a splitty, too cheap to buy a wc Vanagon, 
and too cussed to own a normal car.
