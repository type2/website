&gt; 1. Is it worth just changing the brushes on the generator? Or should I just

If you've been running with bad brushes the commutator is now shot.
Replace the whole generator or take the armature out and get the
commutator turned.

&gt; 2. If I just replace the brushes, should I still change out the voltage
&gt; regulator? I know to change it if I need a new generator.

Keep a spare regulator around.  It makes troubleshooting much easier.

&gt; 3. Could any of the running on pure battery have damaged my starter?

No.

&gt; 4. Could any of this have damaged my coil or any other charging components?

Unlikely.

If this is a type 1 engine, you might consider changing to an alternator.
It is almost as easy as changing the generator and eliminates lots of
problems.
