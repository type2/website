Subject: RE: '79 Windshield Gasket

&gt; &gt; BTW I did call VW dealer and guess what..yup you got it
&gt; &gt;  right again...obsolete items. Any comments or similiar problems
&gt;
&gt; When your VW dealer tells you this, politely ask them &quot;what  are they
&gt; fitting to the brand new T2s being made today in Brazil&quot;.



Yes, VW does make the gasket in Brazil. It is the same as the original but
for one thing.  It extends _just slightly_ lower on the body than the
original one did - not enough to be noticable, maybe an extra 1/4-1/2&quot;.  As
it happens, this is a great advantage for us bus owners, because the slight
difference can be enough to conceal most minor rust repair that you will
almost certainly have to do to the lip right below your windshield. I
believe that I am the only one who has this genuine VW windshield gasket in
the U.S.  It runs $18.95 and is on my website.  This is a &quot;cal look&quot; seal
(no molding groove). Note that this is _not_ the same as the Brazilian
windshield gaskets sold by Motorworks and most other vendors.  Those are
_not_ genuine VW but are made by an aftermarket company in Brazil, and are
not of the same fit or finish.

I have put a lot of effort into sourcing my '68-79 rubber and am confident
in saying that you cannot get better rubber anywhere, even though my prices
tend to be cheaper.  I use different sources for different seals, after
comparing the fit and quality of the various options. Since I distribute for
West Coast Metric, Wolfsburg West, Rocky Mountain Motorworks, and others,
these were among the ones I considered, and here and there you'll see those
brand names on the rubber I ship.  But in many cases (such as the genuine VW
windshield seal above) I found what I felt to be better alternatives
elsewhere.

My side window seals and sliding door seals are European made, not Brazilian
like most of the competition's, and are every bit as good as the originals.
I am the only one in the U.S. who has these European seals, since I import
them directly myself.  My engine lid seals are also European made, and
unlike the ones sold by West Coast Metric and others, are the correct
one-piece, four-cornered seals, not four separate you-glue-them-together
generic strips. My poptop seals are custom made to my specs and closer to
original than any others on the market, period.  On the other hand, the rear
hatch window seals I currently ship are Wolfsburg West, since I have been
unable to beat their quality (so far :-), and most of my front door seal
items are Brazilian because that's just about the only thing available,
regardless of whose name you see rebranded on the label.  (However, a few of
them are genuine VW-Brazil rather that afttermarket, where available.)

Sorry for the shameless plug, it's just that I've worked really hard
sourcing this rubber and didn't want to miss the opportunity to gloat about
it. :-)
