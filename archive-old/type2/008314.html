This is a cross -posted because the question posed might apply to splits!

The  Westfalia interior was removed from DocRic's parts Westy and has been
sitting in the 72 for a week. I just finished taking it all out and hauling
it thru the yard and down into my basement laboratory. The interior is in
quite good shape especially the plywood vanier. The finish seems to be the
same as that in late spitty Westy interiors. The quality of the plywood
appears to high. Even the grain on the non-exposed or unfinished vaniers is
enviable by todays &quot;Home Depot&quot; standards.

From many posts I know that the Westy interior panels are of baltic birch
plywood. Are the lane change eliminator closet, jumpseat and bed also
of(thicker) baltic birch? The current plan is to remove the interior
passenger bus pamels from the 72 and use those as templates to fashion new
panels. I would like to be able to match the finish on the new interior
panels to the finish on the LCE closet, bed and jumpseat. Can anyone
recomend a stain, oil, varnish etc that I can work with?  

Research also indicates that the white plastic trim is not available in
repro form. Mine, as most, has shrank. I recall dicussion on various
solutions: heatgun, boiling, voodoo. What has worked for you?
