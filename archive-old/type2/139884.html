&gt; I almost forgot... My license plate isn't mounted. Just setting on the

&gt; bumper, what are some of the solutions ya'll have come up with?

well we have had a rash of tag thiefts in our area so my front tag is on
the dash and the rear one is riveted on.

but you can make a mount that you can bolt to the bumper mounting bolts.
I have made brackets to hold the straps for keeping my canoe on top of the
bus and have them bolted there.
