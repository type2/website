To be redundent with a recent thread, while the engine is out would be an
EXCELLENT time to replace all of the fuel lines.  They are very easy to get to
with the engine out.

 Its also a good time to fix leaky things, and check to
see that the oil cooler isnt completely plugged up with crud, and check the
crankshaft endplay, although this takes considerably more time to get the tin
and fanhousing off to do these things.  However, IMHO, I suspect that the time
spent on cleaning will return itself many times through longer life by cooler
running.
