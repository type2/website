Subject: idle problems

edna's being stubborn again, as usual. (edna = 1977 transporter, 2L FI) This
time she'll start and rev up and everything, but if i let her fall below
1500rpm or so, she'll die. she ran just fine 2 days prior, i even got her up
to 70 mph for the first time (woohoo!). The only thing i did in between was
to tighten the throttle return spring. I tightened the spring becuase she
wouldn't return to idle, she would instead return to 2000 rpm unless i went
back to the throttle body and pushed it back down to idle.

so, I think now that i tightened the spring, i've created a problem with the
egr valve (ie it closes now but it didn't close before??).  anyone had any
experience with this problem??

don't think it's ignition, because it starts. don't think it's a clogged
fuel filter or faulty fuel pump, because she'll run as long as the throttle
is open. don't think it's a vacuum leak because i checked all my vacuum
lines.

any other suggestions, oh mighty list??

thanks in advance,
