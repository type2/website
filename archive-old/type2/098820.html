&gt; Craig, my understanding is that if you have compressed air and your
&gt; valves and rings are in good shape, you can use a sparkplug adapter
&gt; to blow compressed air into the cylinder (like a leakdown tester
&gt; does), when it's on it's compression stroke at TDC, and this will
&gt; keep the valves against their seats. 

another technique is to take some of that 1/4&quot; nylon cord &amp; feed it
into the cylinder at the bottom of it's stroke. then rotate the crank
will the cord will help hold the valves in place.
