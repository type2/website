Subject: Opinions Wanted: Governor on Distributor?

hey now,

just wondering if anyone has some opinions on installing a distributor that
has a governor that prevents the engine from going over a certian rpm. they
are about $30-$40 and i've heard they are good to have. seems like a good idea
to me. small price to pay to protect your engine. but i'd like to hear from
the vw gurus on the list....

thanks,
