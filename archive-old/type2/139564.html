I'm really feeling for you this morning...wish you guys all had all the

Are either of them goingto be repairable?

Wishing you a better morning, dave

snipped a bit

&gt; isn't. The 77 has over 300,000 miles on it, the 78 only has 100,000 on it.
&gt; Maybe the miles cause the front springs to sag? Maybe the 78 is set higher in the front? Don't know.
&gt; 
&gt; But I do know that a drunk in a stolen pickup, at 1:15 am today, plowed head-on into the 78 which then got
&gt; pushed back into the 77. Took out the front and rear of the 78 and the front of the 77. Moved both back each a
&gt; car length. The white late model Chevy crew cab pickup suffered the most damage. The hood is bent back to the
&gt; windshield and both air bags blew. Unfortunately the drunk got away.
