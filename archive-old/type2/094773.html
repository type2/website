Subject: Re: [T2] Light additions, inverters 

Mike,

I saw your post about watts and amps and 12 volts.

The Trak Auto store has a fluorescent droplight running on 12 volts.
It is rated as 8 watts and says it draws 0.5 amps.

From your post, this sounds about right, 8 watts = 0.5 amp draw.

Number #1 question:  If I had a fully charged battery when I pulled into a 
camp site, how long could I keep the 8 watt/ 0.5 amp drop light on before I 
drained the battery too low to start the fuel injected VW?

( I know, it all depends on the battery, but just assume some nominal 
figures on the CCA, ambient temp, that you base the estimate on ))

I just want a glow to see by, but I would be afraid to fall asleep with the 
light on and drain my battery.  Would I be able to start the VW the next 
morning??

Ball park figures!?!?

Number #2 question: 'about' how many lumens would a 7 watt 110 volt night 
light bulb put out, and how many lumens would I expect to get from the 8 
watt fluorescent drop light.

Thanks
