Subject: City Water Hookup

----__JNP_000_60a7.5229.6d98

I've never hooked up the city water to my Westy in the seven years that
I've owned it until the other day. The city water won't flow through my
Westy faucet. As always my 12v pump works just fine but the city water
won't flow through the faucet. Are there any tricks, regulators etc that
are required?
