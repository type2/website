&gt; will a steering lock and ignition switch from a 70 bus work in a 73?
&gt; Mine is gone and has a bug ignition switch spliced in.  Very scary.  
&gt; Sparks and stuff.  I need the electric half, key half and steering
&gt; lock.  I just did not want to spend the $100 at RMMW.  If anyone has
&gt; any suggestions or insight.

get it for less at Bus depot, or get good used from BustedBus
