A clarification - from what you've said, it's not &quot;running&quot; on 2 cylinders, 
it's &quot;idling&quot; on two cylinders.  At idle there is very little air (really 
a/f mixture) going through the intakes so a small vacuum leak makes a big 
difference.  When you open the throttle, vacuum drops and large amounts of 
air go through so the leak becomes less noticeable.  It's quite common to 
be able to pull plug wires at idle and not notice a difference with vacuum 
leaks however the engine will probably fire on all four if you floor it, if 
it has compression.  A compression test, as usual should be your very first 
check of engine condition.  Diagnosing anything else without knowing the 
compression is simply a waste of time.  If compression is low, check and 
adjust the valves and then recheck compression.
