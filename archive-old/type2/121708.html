Sure, rebuilt more than 50 over the years. Quite a learning experience.
There are differences between the German and the Brosol and between CA
carbs and all others. A few things to consider up front:
1) German is better than Brosol
2) Pre-73 any is better than any of the bug 74-2003 (soft metal)
3) Be sure to check the archives for all the mods and tricks

One thing I do which isn't written down is to hone down the bowl cover
on a flat stone. I use 400 grit wet/dry paper and I use a 1&quot; thick piece
of glass as my stone. There are two primary vacuum leak points on the
carbs, the bowl cover and the throttle butterfly shaft. For awhile back
in the early nineties I had a jig that I could overbore the shaft hole
and press in new copper/brass bushings. I solder the hole in the
butterfly plate but others pop rivet it. You can get replacement jets
from Ronnie or go to your local motorcycle shop that has Mikumi jets.
About all I can think of now. Good luck.

Anyone out there rebuilt a 34pict3 carb? Is there a
good &quot;how to&quot; article somewhere that covers this?  Is rebuilding an old
carb worth it, or is it better to just buy a new one??
