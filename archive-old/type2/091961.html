Subject: Re: [T2] Re: safe jacking to go under bus...

Mike, I respectfully disagree... and this is important.

To repeat:

Do not use anything that used to be sand and gravel or clay to do
anything but support the roof over your head. 

Concrete blocks will work until they fail without warning. It ain't
*if*, it's *when*. Most of all laid flat. Concrete blocks are engineered
to take static compressive loads with the holes in them oriented
vertically. Emphasis on STATIC. Prefered use is with a 1/2&quot; to 5/8&quot;
rebar grouted in. Jerking your bus around ain't static.  Please use
either properly rated jackstands and a solid base or properly sized
wooden blocks in good condition.

Anecdotal example follows:

Next time you're sightseeing, notice the house that's being moved. It
usually has a couple pallets of concrete blocks stacked to one side
being built into a foundation. While the foundation is being
constructed, it's up on jackstands and wooden blocks. Everytime. Why do
you suppose those guys don't use the convenient pile of concrete blocks?
The blocks are cheaper...  'Cause they don't want to have to pick the
bloody house up again. And like the wicked witch of the west (or was it
the east?), people die when houses fall on them.

Another helpful hint: Don't use anything that used to be a tree to clean
precision optics. ;o) 

Jim
