Hi everybody,

It is Friday and once again time to shamelessly promote  EveryBus:the
official Type2_dot_campout. EveryBus will be  held on April 16,17,18 at
Hagan-Stone Park just south of Greensboro, NC. We have reserved 30 slots in
one of the RV camping areas as well as a picnic shelter. Lots more space is
available if we need it in the tent loop or other RV area. Fees are $12 per
night per site which includes hookups and use of the bathhouse with hot
showers.

Here is a roughed out events schedule.

Friday: arrive early and get a good spot. Some sorta jug-music (bring yer
noisemaker)
Friday night:hard-core relaxation.
Saturday afternoon: maybe visit METWIZ and see how buses are saved!*
Saturday night: bonfire and door prizes,
Sunday: Carabus to the IVWA Spring Nationals at Farmington, NC ( parts,swap,
car show Type1 drags)

*Kelly Brown (aka metwiz) has graciously offered our group a tour of his
welding (bus hospital) shop. This is a good opportunity to see some serious
bus repair. Cant find his url at the moment but will post it later.

If you have questions about how to get there see that site
