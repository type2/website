Subject: Westy front spring question
To: type2_at_lenti.type2_dot_com

Type 2ers,

We are replacing the front beam on China Cat, the still-on-stands 75 Westy. 
The beam that got is from a standard bus, near the same year. Are the torsion 
bars and settings the same on bus and Westy? Do we need to exchange the 
innards before mounting the &quot;new&quot; one?

TIA/Don Carron
