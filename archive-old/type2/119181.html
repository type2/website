Subject: Re: [T2] the craziest bus mod I've ever seen

&gt; Not to mention that if you read the fine print, neither bus has a clear title.  Methinks he makes too many

And then Mike wrote:
&gt; Besides the sellers rather um, optimistic appraisal of body condition, there's the fact that neither bus is
the year they say it is. The ad say a 72 and a 76, but the briefest of glances  will tell you that neither bus
is later than 71. Either seller is stupid, or doesn't know what they speak of. Of course it could be both.

Well..... the so-called Dark Blue 72 is a 1970. The domed hubcaps say it is a 68-70 with large 5 wheels....
the square side markers say it is a 70 [68-69 were round reflectors].

The so-called Light Blue 76......the flat hubcaps say 71 and up, small 5 bolt pattern, the round bumpers say
71-72, the low mounted front turn signals say 71-72. But the tell-tale that it is a 71 is the taillights.
Granted, he only shows one pic of the light blue one but it is enough to show that it does not have the tall
taillights of a 72 and up. On the 72+, the corner of the bus sticks out to allow the tall lens to sit flat.
The supersize pic shows the same curve from top to bottom.

Not sure about the pic of the engine. The dark blue bus clearly shows both peashooters. The engine is missing
the right one. The light blue bus is out in the snow with the rear bumper on it. The engine pic is missing the
bumper like the dark blue one....
But clearly, if that engine pic is one of the 2 buses, then at least it is the dark blue 70 because that
engine is a single port. I believe the dark blue 70 started life being all white. And the apron horns are
white in the engine pic....
