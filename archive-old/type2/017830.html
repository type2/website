Hi Volks,

Vincent Molenaar &lt;molenari_at_dds.nl&gt; wrote to the List:
&gt; Since 1970 the VIN consist of 10 digits:
&gt;
&gt; for example:
&gt; 
&gt; 24 02 231 450
&gt; 
&gt; 24 = model, in this case a deluxe microbus
&gt; 0  = modelyear: 1970
&gt; 2  = Unknown. This number is always a 2 (doesn't stand for type 2)
&gt; 231 450 = serial number, this is the 231450th bus produced in 1970

About the &quot;unknown&quot; 4th digit:  This is there to distinguish
between the 1st and 2nd decades during which this number scheme
was used.  The 1st decade was the 1960s, the 2nd one the 1970s.

Off topic for the Type 2 list, but good for explanation, and it's
Friday anyway:

There were a few Bugs made in the 1960s with 10-digit VINs, because
in some years ('64 I believe was one), they made more than a million
Bugs.  So, assuming it was '64, they went from 114 999 999 to 
114 1 000 000.  Now, when in 1970 they decided to mark the 2nd 
decade by a newly inserted 4th digit, they couldn't use the &quot;1&quot;
since they might need a millionth VIN in '74 again, which would
have meant another 114 1 000 000.  So, they used a &quot;2&quot; as the
4th digit.

They also had a few years in the 1970s where they needed more than
a million VINs, and there they, predictably, went from
113 2 999 999 to 113 3 000 000 (assuming it was 1973).  

So that's the reason for the odd &quot;2&quot; there in our Buses' VINs.

Airhowlingly yours,
    Erik.
