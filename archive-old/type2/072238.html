Subject: Westy roof AC

I have seen a number of westy window ac units, but I have yet to see one of
the coleman roof ac units on a Westy.  Has anyone done this?  What problems
are there surrounding this?

I would like to put one on the front luggage area of a 78 Westy.  I was
hoping to use the unit both going down the road along with at the
campground.  Can it be done?  Should it be done?  Thanks
