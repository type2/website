&gt; sorry i couldn't make Ebus this year. this was the first one i missed

missed a great one
&gt; 
&gt; anywho, i was recently offered a good nose section from a parts bus
&gt; to repair the badly damaged nose on my new-to-me 77 Riviera.

&gt; 2) what tools will i need to do the job?
&gt; 3) are there any articles, etc. out there that will help me?
&gt; 
&gt; please keep in mind i have never really done any type of
&gt; bodywork, so please explain so a 'beginner' can understand.

take a sawzall and a box of long metal blades, figure out how much you are
going to need of the nose and then cut all the way around the bus about a
foot further back, finish on the roof and have the nose supported so it
doesn't fall, put in truck or trailer and take home, it will be pretty
heavy, at home remove what you don't want or need.

have fun, I took a front quarter like that and it is amazing what a
sawzall will cut, heck just sawed the windshield in half (it was already
broke and worthless)

Good luck and be carefull
