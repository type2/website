Subject: FREE*

I went junkyarding today and I found something rare......and I will let 2 people have them Free*.

What, you ask?  What is the holy grail of type IV engines?

Will this stop male pattern baldness?  uh.........no. Not a Miracle cream.

Will this give you 25 HP on your type IV engine?  uh........ no. I would be lying

Will this give you up to 25 HP on your type IV engine? uh............no. I would still be lying.

I found 2, count 'em 2, tastes in one......[oops wrong commercial]
I found 2 pairs of the flaps that go in the bottom of the fan housing.......

And now you ask, how can I get a pair Free*?

Will I need to give up my 1st born son?  uh.......no. You will need him to install the flaps!

Will I need a E E degree?  nope..... not even a M E degree.

Here's the deal: Free* always has fine print. See the *?  No, it is not a dead bug on your monitor
screen.  The * is the catch. All the 1st 2 people that want a pair has to do is make a donation to the list
fund. I don't care how you pledge to http://www.type2_dot_com/donate.html  This is a trust deal.
Hmm, maybe an auction with the proceeds going to the fund would better...... maybe next time.
How, you ask, can I invest my time and equipment and give this stuff away? I must be nuts. But don't question
it or I will pick up my toys and go home:)

1st 2 people that want them: Pmail me and I will mail them to you.
