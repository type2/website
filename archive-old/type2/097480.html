Subject: Re: [T2] WTB: Exhaust parts for 74/75

[...]


&gt; I'm starting to look for parts to rebuild the exhaust on my '74. It
&gt; currently has a '75 exhaust on it. The heater boxes aren't too bad off but
&gt; new ones would be wonderful. I definitely need a new muffler. I'm in
&gt; Chattanooga, TN - so if there are heater boxes to be had, they probably
&gt; need to be with a few 100 miles so I don't have to pay shipping.
 
Which system do you want? 
72-74 is totally different from 75-79.
