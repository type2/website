&gt; My main question is it okay to use Valvoline 80/90 synthetic gear oil?
&gt; What are GL#'s I see mentioned in the archive posts? Are there pros or
&gt; cons to synthetic gear oil?

I've had synthetic Valvoline 80/90 weight in mine for years,  now I have
an automatic so I only have it in the final drive but have not had any
problems. and the GL 5 problems do not affect synthetics
