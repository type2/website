Subject: Re: [T2] NPT

well it worked out for me, in checking my taps I have 1/8npt but no 10x1.0
only 10x1.25 and 1.5. Must be mighty close as 1/8 threads in real easy with
no bite on my spare case.

&gt; &gt;Having worked as a fire sprinkler designer, I always saw it written as
&quot;nominal pipe thread&quot;,
&gt; &gt;meaning pipe that had a I.D. of 1.038&quot; say, was called 1 1/4&quot; NPT?

&gt; &gt;1/8&quot; NPT (National Pipe Taper) thread.

&gt; Maybe should be Normal Plumber's Measurement, insofar as it
&gt; appears they don't use rulers. And 1.038 &quot; is not 1 1/4 &quot;.
&gt; (But maybe close enough for plumbing work :)
&gt; Even more curious why there is no DIN for the oil sender hole.
&gt; So, OK, then- just how close is the interchange between  senders
&gt; that are 10X1.0 straight thread and those that are 1/8 i.p.NPT tapered ?
