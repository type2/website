I think the statement you are looking for is what my dad told me when I was
a young pup.  It is : &quot;There is no replacement for displacement&quot;

Having owned and driven a Judson supercharged vehicle and a
turbocharged vehicle I *might* be qualified to answer...

Turbocharged vehicle was a '78 Buick Regal.  Factory T-charged 3.8
V-6.  Initial c/r 6.5:1. Started making boost about 3-5 seconds after
flooring the throttle.  Max boost was (as I remember) about 7 psi. 
Smooth increase in power.  Smooth increase in the rate of the gas
gauge falling.  Big factory designed cooling system didn't notice the
increase in heat from the engine.  Following proper procedures in
cooling the turbo prior to shutdown still resulted in having to
replace the 'center rotating assembly' about every 35k miles due to
coked and failed bearing and blown seals.

Supercharged vehicle was a '66 TR-4.  Judson system added by me. 
Initial c/r 8.5:1. Made 7-9 psi boost as soon as you nailed it.  Power
was there.  Instant 150-160 hp.  Oiling system used ATF.  Reason for
oiling system was to lubricate the apex seals of the blower.  Oil in
intake charge lowers the octane (anti-knock) rating of the fuel. It
does not lower operating temps, it raises them!  To overcome
detonation one has to do some fairly creative engineering.  Water
injection (Spearco Injectronic), completely reworked distributor to
give a fair amount of retard at full boost, best fuel one could buy
(Chevron Custom Supreme at the time RON 104-105 typically).  Heat
created on boost would raise the coolant temp about 20 deg F over a
period of about 5 min. There it seemed to stablize, though one was
rarely 'on boost' for any length of time.  Had a tendency to blow up
transmissions.  I suspect that if one just held the throttle down,
even with all the modifications, I would have holed the pistons.

In sumation:  Having owned both, I'll take a normally aspirated stock
motor over both.  I just don't think rebuilding motors every 20k miles
is fun any more.  The required fuel is available only at airports at
close to $3.00/gal.  You have to take it home in a barrel.  

If I wanted the 'boost' that a supercharged engine would give, I'd
look for a larger engine.  As the sign at the Speed Shop says
(actually two signs), &quot;There ain't no substitute for cubic inches&quot; and
&quot;Speed costs money, how fast do you want to go?&quot;

&gt; Hi all,
&gt; 
&gt; I found this thread really interesting with regards to the cooling aspect.
&gt; Can anyone out there compare the turbo setup (cooling and powerwise) to
the
&gt; old judson supercharger installation for the 36 and 40 HP motors? I'm
&gt; thinking of the fact that the Judson setups have the marvel oiler as well
&gt; which is said to both lubricate and reduce operating temps.
&gt; 
&gt; I realize that this may be more of a vintage bus question but enquiring
&gt; minds want to know....;-) Please P-mail instead if you feel the reply is
not
&gt; appropriate content for the list.
