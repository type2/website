&gt; Also, another trick I learned that may work on a late bus (correct me if I'm

&gt; The top motor/tranny mounts are a real PIA to get to. On my '70 I undo the
&gt; rear mounts first so that the engine/tranny are supported by the floor jack.
&gt; Then I lower them a bit so that I can get to the top motor/tranny mounts
&gt; easier (no top access door on an early bay). The mount by the starter is the
&gt; worst -- I remember from changing out the starter on my '75. You can get to
&gt; the nut in the engine compartment from the top access panel, but it helps to
&gt; put some duct tape on the head of the &quot;D&quot; bolt where it attaches to the
&gt; starter assembly to keep it from spinning/falling out. This is especially
&gt; helpful when putting it back together.

Sean, yes and no, more or less.  You can't loosen the hanger bar on a T4
and just lower it like you can on the '68-71 buses, there are bolts thru
the top of the trans that hold it in place.  You could remove those bolts,
but they are as easily accessed (not!) as the engine/trans bolts, so there
really isn't a point.

Finding and removing the upper left bolt engine/trans bolt is bit of a
pain, but I've never had a problem with the starter bolt.  First, make
sure that the threads are clean, clean, clean and that the nut spins on
easily. Second, push it into place from underneath, then go on top and
hold it from pushing back thru with a small flat blade screwdriver while
you start the nut on it.

Last weekend I gained a whole new appreciation for the problems our
european brethren face, however.  Pat Flynn bought a euro-spec '75 double
cab with a 1600 DP motor in it.  No overhead access hatch and the upright
fan shroud.  What a pain getting the starter bolt off was!!!!  And I may
wind up gluing or duct taping the bolt to the starter as you suggest to
get it back in.  On a T4, that nut is right out in the open because the
fan shroud is not there, but it's gonna be unpleasant with the fan in the
way, I can tell :-)

I also finally &quot;got&quot; the urge to cut the rear cross member out, as we
jacked the tail of the bus to ridiculous heights to get the fan shroud
out.  I felt like I was bleeding a wasserboxer!!!  I had never understood
the urge to cut, as on a T4, it's &quot;lower the engine, slide it out&quot;.  At
worst, you have to take the bumper off for an extra 2-3&quot;.  On that silly
DC, you have to go up another 6&quot; and slide it out the rear wheel well!
Does removing the rear road wheel help, BTW?
