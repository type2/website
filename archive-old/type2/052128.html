Subject: [T2] Web Page Update

Hey Folks,
    Updated my web page this morning with this weekend's project: repairing 
the bottom of the sliding door. I swore when I bought this Westy and started 
the restoration I wasn't going to fall into this trap, but I have. I swore 
I'd work on ONE thing at a time, finishing that before moving on to something 
else. Well, I now have the interior half removed, recovering the cushions, 
recovering the headliner in the cab area (PO had glued AND screwed a some 
vinyl lined drapery materiel to the headliner! Geez! ) and a half dozen other 
jobs in various stages. I know better but it happened anyway. Here's the link 
if you want to have a look &lt;A
