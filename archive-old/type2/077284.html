Subject: Re: [T2] Fuel Lines

Hello Sam,

I replaced the solid line from the tank to the fuel
filter with FI grade hose (although it is not on the
pressure side of the pump so FI may not be neccesary).
 A word of caution if you do this.  I  clipped the
rubber hose back into the brackets that held the solid
line up and off the trany (a tight fit).  When the
engine warmed up it would warm the rubber hose making
it more maluable which in turn allowed the clips
holding the rubber fuel line to clamp off the fuel
supply. I was tracing hot stall issues in the FI for
some time before I found the problem (by accident when
replacing brake lines). 

Best of luck,
Rick

PS Don't forget the short length of return fuel line
on the passenger side of the engine.

&gt; Okay,
&gt; 
&gt; Now that I've got the engine running well in the 78,
&gt; I
&gt; have noticed that the fuel lines are less than
&gt; perfect
&gt; and after all this talk of bus fires, I want to
&gt; replace them.  It looks pretty straight forward, but
&gt; one question.  The line that runs from the fuel
&gt; filter
&gt; to the tank is metal; is it okay to replace this
&gt; with
&gt; high pressure fuel hose?
&gt; 
&gt; Any other thoughts on fuel line replacement would be
&gt; great.
