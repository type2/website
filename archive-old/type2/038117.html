Subject: Wiper problems too

I have problems with my wipers.  For some reason when it is raining, it
makes a REALLY LOUD creaking noise and this last time just quit working
totally.  However, the next day I got in (no rain) and they worked fine,
no noise, and all that good stuff.  I'm wondering, I have a leak
somewhere up front around the dash, would water getting in the motor do
this?  I'm so confused about it.
