&gt; I assure you our timing specs are correct.

&gt; The addl 10-13

&gt; to get better mileage and run cooler.

Good point.  

&gt; if you like the engine running hotter then
&gt; designed and getting worse
&gt; mileage, by all means retard the timing from
&gt; our suggested settings.

That's the way most mechanics time them.  Hot and
thirsty.  

&gt; Also, Ronnie is at OldVolks, it's me at
&gt; Aircooled.Net. 

I've messed this up several times.   The dizzy
list was Thompson, right?

&gt; Lastly, specs for OUR
&gt; SVDA are different then any factory unit, so
&gt; don't confuse our SVDA with the
&gt; ones offerred factory installed by VW (we
&gt; recurve them here), they are NOT
&gt; THE SAME.

Well, OK.  But the last specs you gave us were:

&gt; a stock distributor from 1976-1983 has 32 total

at WOT, 42-45 at part
&gt; throttle cruise (read the Bentley manual if you

doubt me). Ours is a
&gt; modified curve from this, with the same 7.5 
idle, 32 total centrifugal, and
&gt; 42-45 full advance (only under certain 
conditions).

Those look awful similar to me.  If the specs are
actually different, then let us know what they
are now.  It looks like a perfect dizzy for any
T4 engine to me.
