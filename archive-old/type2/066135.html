Subject: Help
     I have done every sinario that I could think of and am still unable to 
     figure out how to get off of the list.  
     
     What should I write on the subject line?
     
     What should I write in the body of the message if I want to get off of 
     the Type 2 list?  My email address is snewland_at_symantec_dot_com
     
     Thanks for your help.
     
     Scott.
