Subject: Sliding door not shutting properly

After 4 busses over the last 18 years, I'm
finally having my first sliding door problem. 

Mine won't close easily. I have to hold the rear
of the door so that it is away from the rear
sheet metal. If I try to close it normally, the
rear of the door collapses into the body.
Something plasticky during the night, and now I
only have pieces of it. It is black and appears
just to be a trim piece. I suspect my real
problem is something else. The archives and
webpages I can find (Dolan and Ratwell) don't
really explain the part that isn't working:  the
keep it out away from the body part.
  
Any ideas?



Happy bussin'
