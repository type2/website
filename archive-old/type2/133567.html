Subject: Re: [T2] starter question on a auto vanagon

&gt; I'm having wiring nightmares.  I think I may have wired my starter wrong.  It turns over, but no juice is getting to the fuel pump.
&gt;
&gt; I have a 1981 Vanagon CA emissions with automatic transmission.  The starter doesn't match the one in Bentley; it has an extra terminal, for a total of five connections.
&gt;
&gt; When I'm under the van looking up at the solenoid, there are:
&gt;
&gt; 1.  The terminal opposite the starter, where the battery cable goes.
&gt; 2.  The terminal that connects to the starter.
&gt; 3.  A terminal on top with two connections for push on wires.
&gt; 4.  A terminal on the bottom with one connection for push on wires.
&gt;
&gt; Again, I have five terminals and my Bentley Book only has four.  Any suggestions?


the 5th terminal is a &quot;spare&quot; if it is the same as my 78 auto tranny
starter. it is electrically conected with the two push on connector at the
top..  I ignore it myself.

I suspect your double relay would be the fuel pump problem, certainly the
first place I would check

does the pump work when the engine is started??
