AHHHHHH!!  So that is why in Europe the gas ratings are 90/95/100.  And all
the time I just thought they had better fuel refineries!

&gt; You should be using Super (93) anyway, on your Jetta. All VWs (and any
other European vehicles) were made to run on the higher octane. (Just read
the owners manuals)&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;  PEACE OUT&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;

Not this misconception again :-)
&lt;SEAN'S OCTANE RANT&gt;
Read the owner's manual a little more carefully.  For the Bus, for example,
it tells you you need a minimum of 91 RON octane.  That sounds like premium,
right?  Wrong.  The RON method of measuring octane is not used in the U.S.
so that number is irrelevant.  The U.S. uses a method which is the average
of the RON and MON numbers.  This is what is displayed on a yellow sticker
on the gas pump.  I've seen it labeled the CLC method or AKI.  If you read
further in the Bus owner's manual, it will mention this and then go on to
say that the CLC octane rating is usually four points less than the RON
rating.  Then it says &quot;91 RON equals 87 CLC.&quot;

So, assuming your engine is all stock, especially the compression ratio,
then you can quite safely use 87 octane gas in the U.S.  That's what it was
designed to run on.  Higher octane gas is useful only for higher-compression
engines, as octane measures the fuel's resistance to knock, or pre-ignition.
Most of the air-cooled VW engines have  a compression ratio of 7.3:1 which
is pretty low by modern standards and 87 octane gas is fine for that.  If
you are using higher octane gas, you are simply wasting money.  It won't do
any harm to the engine, just your wallet.  Of course, if you built a VW
engine with a 10:1 compression ratio, then that's another story but that's
not really a VW engine, is it?

I do have a scanned copy of the '78 Bus owner's manual on my web site if
you'd like to check it out, the relevant fuel information is on page 26.
