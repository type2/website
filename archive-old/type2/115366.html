Subject: Sunday Brake Work

Sunday:

Emergency brake handle pulls out almost to the max.  Time to adjust the rear 
brakes.

Lifted the 78 Westy rear, and pulled the drums.

One set of brake adjusting stars were locked solid, but the other set was 
loose and adjustable.

Note:  the loose adjusting stars were well greased with bearing grease when 
they were last looked at a year ago; at the same time, the locked set of 
adjusting stars were put in clean, but with no grease.  Apparently the 
grease kept the crud out.  So now I have the answer, and I am not going to 
try never-seize.

Alert:  one of the wheel cylinders was leaking, and I replaced it with a new 
one. I would not have noticed had I not taken the drums off.

With a clean setup on both wheels (moveable adjusting stars), I brought both 
adjusting stars on one wheel out 3 turns, fitted the drum, punched the brake 
pedal in the drivers compartment a few times to reset the brakes shoes, 
turned the drum by hand and if the drum was freely moving, I pulled the drum 
and adjusted the stars a few more turns. Repeat above.

When the drum would go on snugly, and after I hit the brake pedal three 
times and the drum would just drag a bit, I was golden.

I bled the one wheel cylinder (ugly looking fluid, BTW) and put the wheels 
back on.

Now my emergency brake handle just pulls out 3 or 4 clicks.  No need to 
adjust the brake cables.

Also, now I have a hard and high brake pedal.
