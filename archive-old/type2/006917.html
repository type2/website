&gt;A '66 bus would have had &quot;pointed&quot; bumpers, and the ones WW sells are
&gt;the &quot;slash&quot; style for '59-65.  I have seen and picked up the WW ones.
&gt;They are MUCH lighter than an original bumper, so I am guessing they
&gt;are made of lighter guage metal.  There is also a notch in the bottom
&gt;of the rear bumper blade for some reason.

All of the original '67 down bus FRONT bumpers I've seen have a half round notch
cut out of the bottom center of them.

WHY????

Anybody know the answer to this bizarre VW practice???
