&gt; I had the idea to repro the one that fits the front of my own bus (I don't
&gt; have an emblem for it, would have to find one), but got a number of warnings
&gt; about the VWoA thing.

Perhaps you could sell it in parts.  A circle here, a stylized &quot;M&quot;
there...

If you're making them of resin, just cast in a few little neodymium
button magnets.  They'll hold tight to the body without drilling holes,
and you can remove the emblem to prevent theft!  If someone does steal it,
at least they won't screw up the bus getting it off.
