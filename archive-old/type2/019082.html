Ive decided to install an electric fuel pump in my 72 westy, i want to
mount it on the pannel between the engine compartment and the fuel tank
but im afraid of punctering the tank, anyone have any suggestions,
warning's about drilling it? do i have to pull that pannel off to drill
it, i also want to mount a relay for a duel battery kit there.
