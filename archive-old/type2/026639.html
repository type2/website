DOH!  Looking at the wrong rack....the tray/basket in the bottom of the
icebox in the picture http://www.72camper_dot_com/3936.jpg is probaly not an
original tray.

He was asking about the tray on the BOTTOM of the cooler. He has the drip
tray and the rack.
That BOTTOM tray is NOT original.

&gt; Hi all...
&gt;
&gt; Just wanted to confirm that the tray is an original Westfalia part which
&gt; came with all busses with the IceBox like the on in the '70-72 (not sure
&gt; what other years have them)
&gt;
&gt; I have a scan of an original '70 camper suppliment booklet(also avalible
on
&gt; line somewhere...but can't remember where...), witch shows the tray just
&gt; belor the Iceholder (the wire &quot;basket&quot;)  Unfortunatly these are a little
&gt; hard to find due to mis-uses that caused it to crack or brake in the past.
&gt; Most people used the tray to store the ice, and the 'basket' for other
&gt; things...
&gt;
&gt; I haven't seen it aftermarket either...so the best one can do with out it
is
&gt; find a tray that fits in the 'basket' or in the slider and connect the
&gt; hose...
&gt;
&gt; Goodluck on your quest..
&gt;
&gt; &lt;&lt;snippity...snip snip&gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;I'm not saying it absolutely is not an original Westfalia part.  I'm
saying
&gt; &gt;that in nearly 30 years of '68-'72 Westfalia Campmobile experience I've
&gt; &gt;never seen such a tray, even in a brand-new rig.
