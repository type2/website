 So from your pages, I need to find either of:
 VW 039-905-205C or Bosch 0237 022 009Does anyone on
 the list have any tips
 on where to find one? Googling the part numbers
 doesn't bring up much
 info...
 
----------------------------------------------------
 
I have a bunch of them. At one time I was putting
together and selling a drop-in swap kit to convert any
bus type 4 engine over factory electronic ignition.
But I ran into a problem finding good used harness's
between the module and the coil. Age gets to the 3
wire plug where the wire insulation enters the plug.
So I have about a dozen or more dizzys and modules,
but no harness's worth a darn....
I gave up picking up the dizzys from the yards lately.
