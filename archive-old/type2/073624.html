Subject: Re: 78 bus FS in NewHampshire

Hi Gang,
   Regretably, I have to sell my bus.  I bought it in the spring =
with all sorts of good intentions, but winter is coming and I need =
a better way to haul the kids once the snow flies. =20

The good:
Its a well kept '78 2.0 l FI bus that hasn't been messed with.
The interior is clean and in good to excellent shape
The body is solid and relatively rust free
All the engine tin, dash, guages etc are right
Prettymuch everything works
It has both back and middle seats.
White over orange amature paint job looks good
Clear title
It wont take much to be a nice one

The Bad:
1) I havn't had a chance to get it running (three kids, demanding =
job, house in need of repair, other projects ... you know the =
story).
It turns over and seems like it wants to go.  I put in a new double =
relay and have fiddled a bit, but just dont have the time.
2) very small amount of rust showing through the rear quarter =
pannel, but nothing scary (quite surprising for the North east).
3) small rip in drivers seat
4) small patch of rust under one side window=20
5) tires are okay for towing but won't pass an inspection

I'd like to get $1,000.  I'm flexable but not despirate, and have a =
tow-bar you can borrow/buy.

I'd consider an interesting motorcycle as part or full trade.

We are in Canaan New Hampshire, on Rt 4, 8 miles off Interstate 89 =
(exit 17), 3 hours south of Montreal, 2.5 hours North of Boston.=20

I'd like to find &quot;The Great Pumpkin&quot; a loving home before the snow =
flies.  This bus is Way too good to be parted out.  Please dont =
make me turn it into a garden shed !

Later

Mike
