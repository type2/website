Subject: Erratic Idle

My recently acquired 74 camper 'hunts' at idle.  It's not a predictable thing but it will be idling nicely then the rpms will drop or sometimes increase for awhile then return to normal.  Thanks to the help of some list members I am fairly certain that I have the van timed correctly.  The engine is a newly-rebuilt 1.7L 914 block and it has a Holley 2-barrel carb on it (not my first choice but that's what's there.)  Apart from the idle the van runs very well, accelerates quickly and all that.  Anybody have any suggestions about the idle?  I determined that there were some vacuum leaks around the base of the carb so I corrected that today.  One of my sparkplug  wires has a badly cracked insulator, I'll be getting new wires this week.  The van has an electric fuel pump, is that a likely suspect?

Andre
