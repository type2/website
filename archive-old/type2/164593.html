&gt; He claims this bug dizzie does have mechanical advance.
&gt; He also offers to replace the dizzie with a new 009 which he
&gt; claims is a v good dizzie.  I on the other hand have somehow gained
&gt; the impression on T2 List  -  correct me if I've misread the signals
&gt; -  that the 009 is feared &amp; loathed.  Furthermore, the 009 he can get
&gt; me for U$100 is made in a certain large Asiatic industrial power.  It
&gt; might even have lead paint on the outside  :-}
&gt;
&gt; What do youse dizzie experts reckon?
