Paul, and all,

I had a very similar problem when I put the 091 trannie in my '73.  Fought
with it for months and posted to the list a couple times. Among my major
suspicions was that the varyiong lengths of the early and late trannies
was causing my shifter problems (the 002 is 1&quot; shorter than the 091).
Also thought, as you now do that the trannie was somehow damaged in the
install, tho it had worked perfectly in the old bus. 

After many micro-adjustments to the shifter plate up front, I gave up, we
pulled out the engine/trannie, removed the shifter rod, measured the early
rear shift rod against the late rear shift rod (they are the same) and the
early and late front shift rods (they, too, are functionally the same
length, tho they terminate differently).  Buttoned it back up, and put up
with it for more months.  Pulled the engine again and matched it bit for
bit with my '76......

I had installed the damned shift plate upside down!!!!!!!!

Something to think about :-)  If you have another van available, check the
shift plate orientations against each other, just in case.

In theory, there is no difference between theory and practice. 
But, in practice, there is.
