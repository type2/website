Subject: Under the bus once again.....

Hi All,
Well, tommorrow I'll venture under the &quot;Frijole&quot;(77'-72'blended bus)
to find the &quot;new&quot; oil leak. Perhaps I should call it a pour? Anyhoo, 
it looks like it's coming from the pushrod tubes but I'm going to continue my delusion that it is really just from the valve covers and will only take 10-15 minutes to &quot;fix&quot;. Stop laughing!!!I've got new seals
and cover gaskets plus two new tubes in case I get too phyisical with
the old ones. The bus has sat for over two years without being started
until last weekend. After some carb work and new plugs etc., it fired
right up! Nasty knocking sound though, comes and goes. Oil pressure is
good, plenty of power. I haven't done a compression check yet.
I just need to make it through emissions here in AZ and then I can
worry about another motor. This one does not blow smoke (except from
the oil cooking off of the heat exchangers) and I hope it'll pass.

Have a great weekend.
Jeff and The Frijole
