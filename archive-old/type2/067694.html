Subject: Chirping noise from distributor?

Anyone familiar with a problem that would cause the distributor to
make a chirping noise?  I used my lug wrench as a &quot;stethoscope&quot; and
I'm about 99.5% certain this noise was coming from the distributor.

I popped the cap off the distibutor (after shutting engine off) and
looked--no foreign objects visible.  I tried turning the rotor by
hand.  It would turn a few degrees back and forth (is that normal?)
and it made a creaking noise as I moved it, almost like a creaky door
hinge.  Is there something that should be greased in there?

Thanks,
Rodney
