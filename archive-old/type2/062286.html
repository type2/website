&gt; the same part. Called RMMW and had them measure theirs, same part.
&gt;       Bus Boys sweetly let me exhange their realisticly priced part
&gt; for credit (Very nice of them) and I used the cheap Mill Supply part. 
&gt;       Conclusion: All three vendors were selling the same part, 
&gt; made in Europe. 
&gt; 
&gt;       Mill Supply talk a good game like they make everything themselves-
&gt; NOT. RMMW and Bus Boys don't make any such pretense. I suspect NONE of the 
&gt; sheet-metal retailers are actually also in the sheet-metal stamping business.
&gt; There may be exclusive arangements between retailer and actual part mfg 
&gt; from time to time.

Das Bulli Haus and the Mfg (shoot, forget his name!) have an exclusive
arangement here in the states.  I like their stuff.  It costs a little 
more, but the reduced frustration level is worth it.
