It may have not have been properly tightened which caused the problem 
and/or just the wrong species and didn't mate up right causing it to loosen 
from abnormal forces. You must access any damage to the flywheel teeth. If 
those are damaged, it will tend to ruin even a new starter gear. Not the 
cheap way to go even if you forget to allow value for your time. Note how 
non-spec parts add up to big bills. If the flywheel teeth are bad, replace 
it and the starter. If the flywheel is ok, just put in a Bosch Corp. Reman 
and be done with starter issues. Good thing is they will probably take that 
Jap starter as a core, but they won't rebuild it. They will throw it into 
the scrap pile where it belongs so no one else wastes any more time/money 
on it.
