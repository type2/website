Subject: Busses in Car and Driver

While looking through some back issues of Car and Driver magazine I found
an article titled &quot;The Van of Aquarius&quot;.  It is about The Greatful Dead (and
their appeal) and the VW Bus (and its appeal).  It has lots of good pictures
all of breadloaves I believe.  I is basically a positive article about the
bus and gives a good general history of it.  The same issue also gives a
short review of the new &quot;Eurovan&quot; that is not so positive.  But of course
they are very concerned with speed and power as usual.
If anyone is interested and their local library carries issues this far back
the article is &quot;The Van of Aquarius&quot; by Steve Spence.  It is in the 
March 1992 edition of Car and Driver on pages 84-90.  The Eurovan review is
on page 91.
