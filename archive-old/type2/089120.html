Subject: Re: [T2] Any suggestions part two


&gt;     Ok, I'm splitting hairs here, but don't forget some special applications
&gt; such as racing cams may be installed in an advanced or retarded position.
&gt; Also some cams have split lobe center-line timing between the intake and
&gt; exhaust.

Does not matter how much advance or retard or overlap you have, basic cam
timing is still in the ballpark to check for TDC on the opposing cylinder.

I did not mention the Mercedes 5 cyl. diesel....its firing order is 12453 or
any other overhead cam engine. On any overhead cam engine, all you have to
look at are the lobes for the cylinder you are wanting to know about. If they
are both up, like rabbit ears, then you are on that cylinders TDC.
