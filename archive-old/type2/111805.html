Subject: Re: [T2] checking for brake fluid leaks

&gt;&gt;So, I wanted to repair the system before bleeding it.&lt;&lt;

good idea.

&gt;&gt;Any advice on how to check for the leak?&lt;&lt;

get under the bus with a light &amp; inspect all of the components
very carefully. of course, you could have the problem of a 
bad MC leaking into the booster as someome recently posted.

i would suspect any joints or meeting places in the system &amp;
of course the wheel cylinders on the rear.

&gt;&gt; and any advice for bleeding the brakes.&lt;&lt;

start with longest pipe &amp; go to shortest. get a helper
with a strong leg!

good luck,
