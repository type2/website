Subject: strange oil temp sensor

After two and a half years of successful monitoring of my oil temp (sender
unit in the crankcase - VDO gauge) a strange thing recently started happening.
I was riding around dusk and turned on the head lights and noticed that the
temperature gauge went UP about 15 degrees. Turn off the lights and it drops
back down. This is an immediate change, not a gradual one. Now it is possible
that it has always done this but after 2 1/2 years of constantly watching the
temperature (habit since I fried an old engine when I first got the bus and
had troubles with a rebuild running hot...) I doubt it has been going on long.
I did just put a new generator in two months ago. I am still learning about
auto electric issues but it would seem if the system was week, turning on the
headlights would, if anything, DROP the temp (less power going to the sensor)
rather than make it go up...Any thoughts? 71 westy 1600DP.
