&gt;The 4 flexible hoses that come off of the intake air distributor on my

&gt;or is this another big project?

It is simple. You can just remove them and replace them. If the engine is 
running well this is not vital, but it is a nice thing to do. It is 
certainly worth while in terms of piece of mind.

&gt;   Also, If they are leaking what are the
&gt;consequences?

If they are leaking then you are getting more un metered air than you 
should. This shouldn't really cause a problem, unless you are having 
trouble adjusting the idle down to the right place. On your engine the idle 
is adjusted by adjusting the amount of un metered air that is going into 
the engine. More un metered air means a higher idle. If your idle is set 
too high then you will run lean, which will cause the engine to run hotter 
than it should.

If your idle is fine, and you haven't had to adjust the idle screw all the 
way in I wouldn't worry about it too much. They are most likely doing fine. 
More important than replacing these is replacing the fuel lines if you have 
not all ready done so.

It is VITAL that you replace the fuel lines if you don't know their 
condition! This is WAY more important then the air hoses you are talking 
about. A broken fuel line means a burned bus. The archives talk about this 
OVER and OVER again for a reason! The air lines leaking means a leaner 
mixture than desired which you will notice when your bus is running hot. 
(You DO have a temperature gauge don't you? If not this is VITAL to the 
long term health of your bus.)

Hope this helps.
