Subject: Re: [T2] Fuel line question (electronic iginition part)

Karl,

I finally got around to putting the vacuum retard line on.  John Anderson
showed me that I did have the proper throttle body with the vacuum retard
port, so I hooked up the return line.  At that point, of course, I needed
to retime it.  When I did, I found that it was only advancing to 10-15
BTDC at ~2500 RPM.  I ran a bunch of vacuum checks.

              900RPM       2500RPM
Retard port    10&quot;            0&quot;
Advance port   0-1&quot;          10-15&quot;
Manifold       18&quot;(!!)        10-15&quot;

The manifold reading at idle was rock solid, so I have no reason to
suspect anything untoward in the compression dept. (and I'm a lazy bastard
:-)  I had picked up a spare dist at some point, so I flopped distributors
and the new dist is working fine.  5ATDC_at_900RPM, advances to ~30
BTDC_at_2500.  Then I noticed the fuel leak as I was buttoning up :-(

BTW, I did break the ears off the idle stabilizer module what with
plugging and unplugging it. Gotta rig some sort of metal bracket for
that :-(
