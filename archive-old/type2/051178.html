Subject: Re: Re: [T2] Rear torsion adjustment (rear view mirror)

Hmmmm, I could see the horizon quite well in my 1969 bus. It had a much longer arm on the rear view mirror. My 1968 to 1972 parts book lists 4 different rear view mirrors - each having a different length arm. I wonder if trucks had a diffent length than buses?

If you go to my page at www.mindpsring_dot_com/~ncbus/ you will find a pic of the 1969 and see the correct length for that year. In the 1972 bus you can see crap out the back.

Remember, in a correctly adjusted bus, you cannot see the horizon in the
inside rear view mirror.  I think this oddity has resulted in more
misadjusted suspensions that any other cause.
