Scott(and Mark),

This is going to be interesting....when Mark looks at his heads and either 
confirms or not whether it is #2 intake.


Why in the world would it be #2 intake(always)? and why does that one get 
hotter?

Anyone have any speculation on that?  It's been awhile since I had mine 
apart that far, but I spent a lot of time getting the flaps and tin 
joining correctly on both sides and double checking the fit and finish and 
movement.

Cheers, dave

&gt; this is a classic sunken valve seat. i have at least 10 heads here
&gt; that look exactly the same. you probably drove for 100's or maybe
&gt; even 1000's of miles for it to look like that. it is always the
&gt; intake valve that goes, and almost all of the heads that do it this
&gt; way are 2 litre heads. It is almost always #2 intake also. I think
&gt; the instructions for CHT gauge installation should be changed to
&gt; using #2 cylinder for the sender, because there is pretty good
&gt; evidence #2 runs the hottest.
&gt;
&gt; when you repair the engine you have to repair the cause of that
&gt; overheating condition.
