I said yesterday,

&gt;I don't like the smell of all this restricting and forbidding.

And I really don't. I don't want to spend my life being your Hall Monitor.
I find the prospect of it distasteful as all hell.

I've been threading old digests all day, getting them ready for a soon to
be released searchable archive. Day in and day out, I'm as guilty as the
next guy of posting messages that don't really do much but amuse me. In
macro, though, it takes you by surprise.

I'm only saving useful mechanical and technical stuff and a thread has to
be fairly good to keep me from tossing it. There's some way excellent stuff
in here--but a lot less of it than you'd think. Out of the 100 digests I've
threaded, which run about 32K each, I have 107 threads so far that might
actually be useful in an archive.

Folks, this is not a social institution. Social institutions are what bad
mailing lists devolve into. Usually shortly before they nova. Doesn't mean
we shouldn't all be friends, but that's not what the list is here for.
Instead, this is (mainly) a mechanical/technical resource. A highly
adulterated one by weight, as things stand.

Here's news: we're probably moving to a different server. Better software,
better everything, believe me. Almost infinitely configurable. File
retrieval. Indexing. Fast propogation. More details on many the advantages
later.

But it comes with a hard choice attached. The new server has limits.
Quotas. Post more than the daily quota of messages and the list locks up.
Scary? It gets worse: there's a subscriber quota too. Only so many listees
and no more, no exceptions, the software is inhuman and ruthless. Oh my
goodness!

It's not as bad as it sounds at first; anybody could read who wanted to,
from Skip's web page; and anybody could post who wanted to because the list
stays open--until we hit that message quota, and then nobody posts anything
for the rest of the day. I imagine that if some of the message slots were
taken up by people who yittered about off-topic or marginal chaff, those
people could expect to be flamed. Or replaced by somebody else who wouldn't
waste valuable space.

The subscriber quota would be 500. Joel said this morning we're at about
480 now. I'm not going to tell you what the message quota would be, but I
will tell you that it is not far removed from current traffic (which is
around 75 per day).

At first I thought, &quot;why, that's out of the question!&quot; Visceral reaction.
Who ever heard of a list that was metered like that? But then I asked
myself something I couldn't answer:

Why is it out of the question when it makes so much sense? Why is it
inevitable that this list should become so bloated that it fails at its
intended purpose?

For the record, the new one isn't cheaper, it's more expensive. That only
matters because what I'm *not* doing is rationalizing saving a few dollars.
Primenet sells me pathetic server software and low hardware priority and
nonexistent tech support, in unlimited quantities. I think I'd rather have
quality from the server and in the content. Scarcity guarantees quality; I
think Bastiat said that.

Send me reasoned, cogent thoughts on this. Do not post them to the list or
I will hunt you down and put gum in your hair. Don't tell me about your
feelings and don't send anything that's worth two cents. Tell me why this
would or would not make type2 a better list.

I apologize for the tone of this, I will concede that I am in a bit of a swivet.
