Had ALMOST the same thing happen to me this weekend.

Was down in Santa Clarita visiting my cousin and while we out on a beverage
run, we had about 10 gang members attack my cousin's 2000 BMW 740i with beer
bottles, their feet, and bats.

We stepped on the gas and spun out getting out of there.  We stopped about
50 feet away to try and get a good look at the guys and from out of nowhere
got t-boned by our attackers with their little Nissan.

Yup, they rammed us.

We hightailed it because the BMW won that fight. (built like tanks)

Bus content:  we hid behind a 21 window in the way home.

I disagree.  Unfortunately there is no place, especially for a female that
is safe.  Always keep one eye open or travel with a couple friends such as
Smith and Wesson.  If you have a bad feeling, trust your instincts and
leave.  Try to NEVER travel alone unless you have &quot;insurance&quot; with you.  I
was filling up off the freeway one time and was attacked by gang members
with baseball bats.  I gave them my wallet with no resistance and they
played Darrel Strawberry with my head while my life flashed before me.
Thanks for making me drink all that milk Mom!  Ever have one eye completely
dilated and the other fully constricted?  Well, baseball bats in the head
will do it to you!  Hope they enjoyed the three dollars they took from my
wallet.

OBLIGATORY BUS CONTENT:

Does anyone know how to seal a sunroof bus?  I bought a sunroof and
installed in in my Westy.  There was, however, no seal and I can see day
light around the corners.  Is this normal?  Is there anyone in San Diego
that will let me see their sun roof bus?  I want to see what it should look
like.  Thanks.

On 8/28/00 12:16 PM, mhogg_at_fastweb_dot_com thus spake:

&gt;Don't travle alone and personally, I would never
&gt;stop at a rest stop. There are State Parks all
&gt;over
&gt;the country where people are required to register
&gt;their names and vehicles. That is a much safer
&gt;place
&gt;to stay the night.

Don't forget walmarts and truck stops. Truck stops are esp. good, as
hollering is likely to bring out some burly fellows with crowbars. You
get used to diesel engines after a while.


Peace,
