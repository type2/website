Subject: Re: Brake Booster Hose Replacement

&gt;equivalent is) and the nipple from the manifold is
&gt;1/8&quot;; no one either at the dealer (or the FLAPS) could
&gt;explain how to get from the big hose to the small hose;

Hi Dan (and anyone else contemplating this mystery!),

An original '71 bus manifold (211 part # prefix stamped on the center
section) has a 1/2&quot; port welded to the manifold.  I use a bug manifold on my
'71 and like you, made an adapter to accomodate the small port off the end
casting.  Most original '71 bus manifolds (one year only part--bugs had a
slightly different center section--only &quot;difference&quot; was no port was welded
on!) don't exist anymore because when the heat risers get plugged and a bus
manifold replacement isn't available, people just swap on a bug manifold and
either braze on a 1/2&quot; fitting or use an adapter off the end casting to
accomodate the '71's power booster.
