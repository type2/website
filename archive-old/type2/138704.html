Subject: RE: [T2] Fuel Injection Pump wiring problem - Fixed

&gt;From: &quot;John Baird&quot;



&gt;As soon as the #1 intake valve is out all the way, should I be looking at
&gt;the timimg lines being lined up with the rotor in the dist, right away...
&gt;because
&gt;I am having to rotate it another 3 inches to get the timing line to match
&gt;the
&gt;dist line and the rotor.  Is the Dist. out 90 or 180 degrees?


Has the exhaust valve opened within these three inches?
