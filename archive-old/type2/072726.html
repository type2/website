Harbor freight has 4 x 3 trailer (2 wheel kits) on sale right now for $130.
I some time tow a 4 x 8 trailer (same manufacturer) with my bus  with no
problems.

Tnx

&gt;&gt; Does a '71 bus with a 1600 engine have any towing capacity?  Stop
&gt;&gt; laughing!  I was thinking about a little, teeny trailer that would be
&gt;&gt; used on trips to get some of the lighter, more bulky stuff like sleeping
&gt;&gt; bags, clothing and blankest out of the bus so the kids have more room to
&gt;&gt; stretch out on trips--instead of being wedged in like cargo!

&gt;&gt; Thanks, Lauria Watts

&gt;Lauria:
&gt;Seems to me I've seen ONE-WHEELED trailers that have virtually no tongue
&gt;weight that were really designed for bugs and buses: Allstate maybe?
&gt;Does anyone know about these.
&gt;I've actually got a chassis for one with a wheel, no box or brackets for
&gt;towing vehicle though.
