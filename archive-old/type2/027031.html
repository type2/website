Hey list,
I've been lurking for a while, and have gotten some good information.  I 
have a wonderfully brown primered(po) 1977 westy that has a bit of a sagging 
problem.  I pretty sure I understand the procedure for turning the torsion 
bars, but I've never done it before. What I would like to know is if anyone 
has on the net or at home any kind of step by step instructions for this.  I 
remember someone talking about it a couple of weeks ago, but I've deleted 
all of that.  Thanks for any help in this.  This is actually bothering me 
more than the primer.
