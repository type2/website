On a long journey earlier this year I had the misfortune of having the
spigot shaft oil seal blow right out and dump all the tranny oil on my
clutch. Miraculously there was a VW dealer 30km away which had both the
seal and a clutch plate (Viva cellphones!). BUT, when I got the parts I
found it was the wrong clutch plate and as it was after hours by then I had
to make a plan ... I took the oil-soaked clutch plate and soaked it in
petrol, using a brush to get as much oil off as I could, then when it was
good and soaked I set it alight and let all the petrol burn out. (DO THIS
WELL AWAY FROM ANYTHING FLAMMABLE AND MAKE SURE THERE&quot;S NO GAS ON YOU WHEN
YOU STRIKE THAT MATCH!!!) Repeated this process several times till the
clutch plate looked as good as new (well, not quite:-). I then put it back
in the car and have driven with it ever since. Have done about 5 000km with
no sign of slippage.

BTW, from the time I stopped with slipping clutch (5.15pm) to the time I
got the car running again, took two-and-a-half hours. I pulled the motor at
the roadside while my sister, with whom we were travelling, drove to the VW
dealer in her 71 westy for the parts. By the time she returned everything
was ready to fit the parts and reassemble, with the only delay being the
clutch plate &quot;treatment&quot;.

I wouldn't usually recommend this except in an emergency, but it does seem
to have worked VERY well.

Hope this helps.
