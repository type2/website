&gt;Hi Folks,
&gt;
&gt;Anybody know where I can find the black rubber floor covering material
&gt;that is on the seat supports.  It runs along by the sides of the seats
&gt;and around the front of them.

Wolfsburg West.

The repro is beautiful, at least when I ordered my set (right after
they started it 3-4 years ago?) it is.  The only way to tell from stock
is that it is intact and that where the VW logo and PN were there
is mysteriously a WW logo.

I think about $40 for the 2 main pieces, I got mine before they
were doing the bits that go back around the back.

John
