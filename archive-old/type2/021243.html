Quoth G.L. &quot;That's why you set (ponts) by dwell, not gap.  Dwell tells
you what the coil is
seeing, gap is just there to get the engine started.&quot;


The only useful thing I remember from perusing Muir is &quot;Timing is when
the match is lit; dwell is how long it it lit&quot;...ie, 50 degrees means 50
degrees of crank rotation.  Can you really controll the duration of the
high voltage current by how long the points are closed?  Could't you
then stick a voltmeter(continuity)  or static light across the points
and determing 50 degrees by how far the rotor moves before opening the
curcuit (distr. out of the bus)?  If the dist. is in the bus, it's the
crank you could mark for 50 degrees, but then the dwell meter is
easier.  MB
