Subject: tons of pictures from Kelley park

Hello all,

http://shop.auctionwatch_dot_com/ChristopherAW/home.html

You can view all of the Kelley park pictures I took from this page. I
created a separate item to view just the baywindows present, there weren't
very many that entered. (I think Larry said 3) There were some really nice
ones parked around the swap area, owned by some of the veedub parts sellers,
if they had entered into the show they certainly would have won the first
two in our class, as a few were in well restored condition.

all in all, it was an amazing show. I spent a few hours of it actually
sleeping up in my bus though for lack of any sleep the night before, but
with all of the exciting cars to look at I managed to stay awake long enough
to wait for the awards and drive myself home. I had no idea this show would
be so huge, I just hope I find out about the next one with more advanced
warning so I can bring some friends along...
