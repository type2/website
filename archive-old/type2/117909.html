Hi Richard,

The site you are referring to is www.banja_dot_com In the beginning they had
indeed the animated video with the rasta man in the Split bus, but they have
moved on with the story.
It is in fact a game and they are now at episode 12. I couldnt find the
Rasta split bus movie back on the site.

However, I am 100% positive this is the one you are looking for. The movie
does still play in my mind too as it is a very nice one.

&gt; I cannot find a link to a web page I had ages ago that featured a camera
approaching the rear of a split bus, through the inside and out the
windscreen (animated). It featured a very 'Reggae' looking driver and music
to suit.
&gt; I'd really like to find it again if it still exists.
&gt; Thanks,
