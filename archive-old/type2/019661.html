John: 
You may have some way of calculating that 6% lean, but I just don't
believe it! I actually think the original post was for MBTE reformulated
fuel and I think you're talking here about 10% ethanol (gasohol).
It's been my experience that gasohol works pretty good in the air cooled
type 4 engines I've used, but the waterboxers I driven long distances
actually got slightly better mileage on regular. I think the alcohol
(ethanol) IS higher viscosity and in greater mixes could benefit from
bigger jets, BUT it burns slower and will actually lower temperatures.
Full-race alcohol-burning air cooled  motors use no cylinder fins, 14 to
1 compression ratios and about 50-55 degrees of total spark advance (ya
gotta lite it sooner cause it burns so slow!). (And yes, really HUGE
carb jets!)
Having said all that, I think Monica's engine is running hot and I think
it's running hot cause it's RICH! Either way rich or lean a little and
you'll be down on power and your engine has to work harder and make more
heat instead of loafing along at 50 or 60% load. 
Monica should just go through the archives, figure out why it's rich and
fix it.
Possibilities:
1. Loose head temp sensor or wire. (or bad sensor- it's cheap, get a
spare)
2. Too high fuel pressure- loose vacuum hose to regulator, or bad
regulator.
3. Leaking cold start injector.
After it's fixed, or SOON, change the oil, maybe to 20w-50 for another
couple of months anyway. The oil has been hot and it may be gasoline
diluted.
Good luck,
