Hey there Volks,

I've often wondered what a bus would run in the quarter mile (elapsed
time and mph). I have thought about running my 79 at New England
Dragway on their Wednesday bracket race night. My westy probably
isn't well suited for drag racing (loaded with camping gear), but a
stripped down transporter with a stroked motor would probably be the
ticket.

David and Jake, Have you run your bus on the quarter mile ?? Anyone
else ?? What was the ET and MPH ?? Anyone have the specs for a stock
bus (hmmm, don't know if any of the &quot;Car and Driver/Motortrend&quot; type
mags reported any of this back in the 70's)

Just curious...
