When Ken Hooper says, &quot;Jump &quot; I say, &quot;Sure when I get around to it.&quot;

A week or so ago Ken proposed the idea of an listing of FREE 
information available about buses. I am not sure if anyone has 
publicly or privately committed to taking on this challenge. I though 
I would give it whirl. Check it out an let me know what you think of 
the basic form and the idea in general.
