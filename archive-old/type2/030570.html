hello,

I will weigh in on this one.  Being paranoid, i have had CO detectors in
my bus for years, and what that has done is have me end up beaing heatless
much of the winter...

Thing to remember, the detectors without a digital display start beeping
when the level is unsafe, and give you no eraly warning.  The beep is
highly distracting, and wont stop until you pull the battery.  If the
interior of the bus is at an unsafe level of CO you may already be a tad
woozy...

So, i bought one at wal-mart for about double that price that has an LCD
display.  100 PPM is unsafe i believe, and it indicates on teh display
what level you are at.  I prefer 0, but if i'm realyl cold i might let it
get to 15 or so.  Anything that stays over 40 or is climbing, i shut off
the heat and get my sleeping bag.

I think the digital display kind is worth the extra price.

take care,

Steve

p.s. i redid my exhaust donuts probably 10 time sot try to fix the leak,
and it kept coming ^$^%$*$ back! so a co detector was a lifesaver in my
case...

p.p.s. In another bus we had it on the seat between us, and it read 0, but
i was feeling woozy.  I asked my GF to move it up next to the heat output
and hold it there, and it started shooting straight up the scale... so
they arent foolproof, i know what CO feels like, but if you dont, try to
check several spots with the meter.
