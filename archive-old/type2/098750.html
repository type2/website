Subject: squeeky front suspension

Just a few days ago my 79 Sportsmofakia started to really make a lot
of noise in the front suspension area. I have climbed under there
several times, but can't seem to find exactly where it is comming
from. I have isolated it to the drivers side, but that's about it.
Thinking mabey the beam needed some more grease I shot some in the
fittings per bentley. Still same problem. Has anyone experienced this
before?
