Subject: WAS: List Mailings - NOW: Heads and CR

Hi Folks,

As a fellow Hotmail user, I set up a special rule telling Hotmail to put 
anything starting with [T2] in my Inbox.  The list's server puts that prefix 
on every Email, so it's pretty much a slam-dunk to have Hotmail look for the 
[T2] and not get spammed.

Requisite Bus content:
I CC'd my heads, calculated my cylinder's swept volume, and measured my deck 
height.  Once I ran the numbers, I figured out my CR to be 7.75:1.  This is 
a bit below the original 8:1 CR, but not so low that I won't have similar 
power to what I had before.  I'll still be able to run 89 octane (still 
below $2.00 a gallon here in the South!) and hope to see lower head temps.  
I hope to order the other head next week, and might actually hit my August 
31 target date!

Wrenching Tip:
Sockets from a 1/2&quot; socket set make great spacers for holding the cylinders 
onto the studs while measuring deck height.

Good Luck!
