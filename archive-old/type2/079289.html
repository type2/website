Hi all,
So I'm having some painting frustrations.  Never done body work before =
so be gentle with me.
The top coat is acting funny.  It's sorta making spider web-like =
patterns in some areas.  These
webs are slightly raised above the rest of the paint, almost as if the =
paint is wrinkling; a funny=20
looking bubble. A friend told me it's due to oils from my (or anyone's) =
hands under the primer. =20
But that doesn't seem correct.
Some background on what I did.  Sanded the rusty spots down to bare =
metal.  Not all spots were
rusty so I didn't go down to bare metal.  Some spots got POR-15 but most =
did not.  Primed, 2-3=20
light coats.  Sanded with 400 grit.  Top coated.  First top coat =
&quot;spider-webbed&quot; or wrinkled or
whatever.
The real odd thing is this has only happened on the top half of the bus. =
 The white half.  This isn't
happening on the bottom half.  The only difference is I'm using a white =
top color on top and a
yellow on bottom.  Yes, I'm using cheap rattle can Rust-o-leum (no =
flames, please) but that=20
wouldn't explain why it's only happening in some places.
So I'm a bit frustrated.  Makes me want to grab a paint brush and just =
start slapping it on.
All helpful comments appreciated.
Thanks,
