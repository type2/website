&gt;This does, however, indicate that you can manipulate the mixture and

Maximum power is made on the lean side of the curve, not the rich side.
Power will fall off as you richen the mixture much beyond stoich.  Most
cars go much richer than that at WOT to protect the engine, even though it
decreases fuel efficiency and hurts power slightly.  Better to lose 3hp and
1mpg than to have to replace engines under warranty, I guess.  Anyway,
richening the mixture beyond factory settings will generally decrease
horsepower on a stock engine, not increase it.
