Subject: RE: [T2] &quot;Shore Power&quot; to charge 2nd Battery

As much as I would love to have my playstation and DVD player in my bus....I
can't help but think it would clash with the era of the bus.  Although,
having two children (4 and 10 months) and having crossed the country with
them already, it is starting to sound like it may not be a bad idea. :)

Imagine two kids under 5 in a Bus for a trip from the east coast to the west
coast? This is why Mr. Lyons has a play station.
