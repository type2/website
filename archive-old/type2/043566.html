Subject: interchangable solenoid?

Hi all,

I was wondering if some of the gurus of the list could clear up something
for me.  A short while ago I posted a question regarding using a solenoid
that once belonged to a 'manual' starter on an 'automatic' starter.  Some
list members said that it is no problem, but the vendors that replied said
that the two solenoids were different.  Does anyone have any experience with
this sort of thing?  I'm not sure what to believe.  Any help or suggestions
would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks,
Keith
