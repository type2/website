Subject: Fwd:  diesel opinions

 Hi,

&gt; I am looking at an 82 vanagon diesel westy and would like any
opinions that
&gt; fellow listees may have.  I know that the main con for this vehicle
is its
&gt; lack of power, but owning a 74 1800 automatic, I am somewhat used to
this. 

 Hmm, only somewhat, though: The (non-turbo) diesel has less power than
your 1800, and the vanagon shell is bigger, heavier and less
aerodynamic.
 I think you'll find that the auto transmission saps less power than the
difference. As long as you're not in the mountains or battling headwinds
it's OK, though (IIRC). Economy is excellent, but that has always
mattered
more in Europe than the US. I presume spares availability is OK because
of shared components with other vehicles but it would be worth asking
our
friends on the vanagon list.
 
Cheers,
	W.
