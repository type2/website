I have a 58 dual cargo door bus , which is essencaly the same as a 
slider, but only with a Cargo door (exactly the same only different =) )
Anyways im sure that dual cargo doored buses went further back than 58...

Also nice try Chrysler... its not a new Idea, 
           GIVE CREDIT WERE CREDIT IS DUE


Anyways Just my 3 cents ...
