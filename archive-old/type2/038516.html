Subject: Rear Bearings, 77-up

Once again, Bentley is meant for early 70's owners.  Bentley shows two
circlips for 1971 and later models to hold rear bearings in.  My '77 doesn't
have a groove for a circlip to hold outer bearings.

Outer bearings completely went out-no roaring, (at least not apparent)
bouncing or wobbling.  They were out long enough to completely wear off most
of the threads for the castellated nut.  (some of you may remember me asking
about the rear wheel falling off-that was the reason).  I assume the
bearings fit tight enough not to fall out, I had to remove the housing and
drive them out.  The inner bearings ARE held by a circlip, and revolve
freely within the housing.

Just want to make sure everything is cool before putting it back together.

For you recent bus owners, I would like to reiterate advice from some of the
seasoned owners on the list.  When you buy a bus, regardless of how
bus-intelligent the PO appears-check everything out-especially brakes and
bearings, and the all important fuel line.  WHEN YOU BUY IT-DON'T WAIT FOR
WARM WEATHER LIKE I WAS!!!   If you have to wait, you probably shouldn't
drive the bus.  We had driven the bus probably a couple thousand miles since
purchasing it from a used car dealer, it probably had not been driven for
over a year.   We were lucky, my son was driving only a block or so, and was
going probably 10-15 mph.  He very well could have been going 65-70, the
wheel fell off the day after he drove the bus over 100 miles.  Not a
pleasant experience for a 25+ year driver like myself, much less for a kid
who has been driving for less than a year.

Once again, I'll count my many blessings this Easter weekend.  The Lord
looks over us that own piece of junk vehicles.
