Subject: Loose valves?

Hey all,

 When one's valves are loose, does it sound like a loose rattling sound
kinda in the rear when you're in the upper RPMs (no tach)? I don't hear it
so much when in lower RPMs. When accelerating into the higer RPMs is when I
start to hear that rattle.

 What might other possibilities be?

 Thanks!
