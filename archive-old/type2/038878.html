Subject: Boston area listees?

Volks,

My job is taking me to the Boston, MA area next week and I was wondering if 
any listmembers in the area were interested in getting together for an 
exchange of food, beer, and bus stories.  I am going to try and visit 
Boston Bob's shop one day also since I've heard so much about him.  If any 
interest in either, drop me a line.  I'll be staying at the Best Western 
Chelmsford Inn, 187 Chelmsford Street.

Happy Friday,

-David
