Subject: Carbs for 79' Westy? and yes it's sold!
X-Diagnostic: MESSAGE MAY NOT BE TOPICAL

I finally sold my westy to a freind of mine, and where
looking for a better carbeurateur set-up, It has weber
progressive 2-bbl, that really sucks for this
application. Is there any other alternatives. maybe
duals would work better.

Thanks
