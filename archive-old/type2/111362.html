Subject: Re: [T2] wireing my radio

thats it thats it...
yes now i can put the other battery back inthe other side of the engine compartment and have two batterys.. yes that is what i am talkign about doing...
i want both to charge but yet want one to run interior camping lights and radio and such ...
but yet still charge by the alternator if i was to crank it and let it run a bit..

that way the other battery is for only starting you are correct you read it right..

&gt;Okay Amigo:
&gt;I think I understand that you are wanting to run your accessories from one
&gt;battery, while reserving the other for starting, but want to be able to
&gt;charge both with your alternator. The simplest way to do this is to install
&gt;a product called a &quot;Battery Isolator&quot; in between the batteries and the alt.
&gt;They are available from any 12v supply (marine, RV, home, ect.), and cost
&gt;about $50. Just insure that you are using proper size (and quality) wire. 12
&gt;gauge is not nearly sufficient to carry the kind of amperage that your alt
&gt;will put out into a low battery over any distance.  Try your library for a
&gt;book called &quot;The 12 Volt Doctor&quot; for more info on this, and on sizing your
&gt;wire, or p-mail me.
&gt;Cheers, and Happy Listening!
