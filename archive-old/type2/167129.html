Subject: RE: [T2] Heater Box Header Pipes

Thanks Greg.It seems air being sucked into the heads where the leak is
occurring is causing a backfiring symptom.  I'll look into the link you've
provided for more info regarding the excessive heat.  So far the suggestions
I've received causing the 'hot running condition' are related to the
following: 1. timing2. lean/rich3. blocked muffler &gt; If the exhaust is leaking
at the head, then the O2 being sucked into &gt; the exhaust might be creating a
secondary combustion in the pipe and &gt; that's where the heat is coming from.
