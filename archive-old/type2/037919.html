&gt; I've got a 1975 bus that was equipped by a previous owner with an upright

'71 was the first year for the dual port engine, so if it is a dual-port
you can assume it is a '71 (or later)

&gt; So, 1st question:  The carb is labeled &quot;30/31 PICT&quot; the on the side.  It 
&gt; looks in every other respect like a 30 PICT-3, but I can't find any listing 
&gt; for it in the Bentley 1968-1979 Type 2 Service Manual or in the Idiot's 
&gt; Guide.  So what is it?  Do I treat it just like a 30 PICT-3?

The 30/31 is a brazilian (or perhaps Mexican) carb that is meant to
replace both the earlier 30 series carbs and the 34 series carbs (with and
adapter)  Mine works fine, but I sense a bit less power than the 34
provided.  My perception might be imaginary, though.

&gt; 2nd question:  The specific problem I'm trying to solve is a major 
&gt; hesitation when attempting to move from idle to acceleration.  This engine 
&gt; has also developed an unwillingness to idle until it is warmed up (then it 
&gt; idle's fine).  According to Bentley, this is probably a problem with a 
&gt; blockage in the area of the accelerator pump/pilot jet, but I'm wondering 
&gt; if anyone has any other things to check.  This engine is equipped with a 
&gt; .009 distributor with Pertronics electonic ignition, timed to 10' BTDC.

The .009 is probably at the root of your problem.  The purpose of the
advance mechinism is to retard the spark for smooth idle and then to
advance it for good power.  In order for the 009 to advance, the engine
has to speed up, but to speed up it needs more power.  You feel this
catch-22 as hesitation.

A vacuum advance distributor, on the other hand, allows advance to kick in
_before_ the engine speeds up, which helps the engine to accelerate.  If
you switch to a vacuum-advance distributor your hesitation will go away.
