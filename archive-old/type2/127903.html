Subject: Re: [T2] The Oil Leak of the Damned

Update:

So, I finally got the fan hub off today.  It looks like the drain holes
(there are two, spaced about 60 degrees apart) are clear.  I'll scrub them
out with a pipe cleaner just to be sure, though.

I'll replace the seal, though it doesn't look like oil's been leaking around
it.  I might as well...  they're cheap.  There was oil everywhere, though. 
It did appear as if some was leaking down the crankshaft between it and the
hub, as it seemed to be before.  I'm hoping I can find a replacement o-ring
in the same size tomorrow.

New things I noticed:  my dipstick boot was cracked.  I can't fathom how oil
would get from there to *inside* the fan (which is, in turn, inside the fan
housing), but of course I'll be replacing it anyway.

Also (and this seems like the most probable explanation), I noticed that my
PCV hose was kinked.  Could this problem possibly be caused by excessive
crankcase pressure?  It seems like a likely hypothesis anyway.

Thanks for everyone's help.  I'll hopefully get it reassembled tomorrow and
report on what's changed (if anything).

-Ian
