In my Bentley, the seals on the typ 4 engine are referred to as the
&quot;Small Crankshaft Oil Seal&quot; and the &quot;Large Crankshaft Oil Seal&quot;,
sidestepping the problem entirely.  I cannot find any reference to
front or rear oil seals.  Of course, on a typ 1 engine there's no
problem, since there's just one seal to worry about.

On the list, it seems that we follow the battle cry popularized by St.
Muir:  &quot;Front is front!&quot;  It keeps things straight, which is what we
really need to do anyway!

What do they do on modern cars?  Left and right crank seals?
