Subject: Re: [T2] which carbs should I buy

Hi Kevin.

It might be simple, but I have heard as many stories of tuning  
problems with weber singles as I have with L-Jetronic FI.

The stock dual carbs are not hard to deal with, they just have to be  
kept in good condition.

Happy Trails,

Greg Potts

&gt; Which would be better for a 1776?
