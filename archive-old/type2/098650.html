Subject: Re: [T2] Flywheel Assembly Balance

&gt; The archives have left me with the impression that having the flywheel

This makes sence, but I'm not sure how useful it is, unless you have
the engine really nice &amp; balanced so therefore you would want the
flywheel &amp; clutch assy to be balanced as well.

&gt; Background:  Rebuilt '77 2.0L.  Flywheel is on, but I forgot to mark the
&gt; original position of the pressure plate when I removed it.  The pressure
&gt; plate and clutch disk are in very good condition, so they're being reused.

Was the flywheel resurfaced? if so that might throw out any condition
that the set was balanced. Since it appears you are not sure if the
flywheel is balanced I don't know if I would worry about it. I would
be more worried about the condition of the wear surface on the
flywheel. Now would be a great time to have that resurfaced (if need
be).


&gt; Situation:  The flywheel has no asymetrical markings which might be a
&gt; balance mark, except for a tiny stamped letter &quot;H&quot; on the inner
&gt; (non-surfaced) face.  The Sachs pressure plate has two white paint marks.
&gt; One is a big blob, the other looks like a sideways number 8 with a capital
&gt; &quot;T&quot; superimposed.

No idea what these mean, but if the place &amp; clutch are balanced I
really don't see how aligning it a particular way would make any
difference. The balancing we are talking about here is radial. As the
flywheel spins no portion is &quot;pulling&quot; more than the other &amp; it can
rotate without having to overcome this constant acceleration of this
one heavy/light spot.

&gt; Question(s):  Are these marks possibly balance marks?  If so, how should
&gt; thay be aligned relative to each other?  If I can't determine the original
&gt; alignment do I need to remove the flywheel and get them both balanced?  If I
&gt; just bolt the thing up as-is, would a lack of unusual engine vibration
&gt; indicate that the balance condition is acceptable?

I don't think you would see much of an improvement, but it's your
time/money. If you would feel better then go ahead &amp; do it. Better to
make sure than to have that hanging on the back of your mind. I
wouldn't worry about it, but then again I have welded up a cylinder
flange so I can drive my bus to work the next day :)

&gt; One other...do I need to check end-play when re-installing the original
&gt; flywheel? I don't own the tool.

YES. This is very important. There are a few different ways to check
endplay. Search the web. I don't have the link handy but someone has
instructions on how to build a measuring device out of some metal &amp; a
feeler gauge. Very simple &amp; cheap. BTW, the tool in question is a
dial indicator. A very nice addition to your tool set. lots of useful
things you can do with it.

&gt; Any thoughts appreciated...

I think the person who painted my bus w/ a paint brush, could have at
least picked a better color....oh, wait. you mean about the flywheel,
sorry. :)
