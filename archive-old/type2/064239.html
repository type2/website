Thanks to all who replied to my message about aux. battery charging.
Thanks to Rick for his not-so-boring battery lecture.
One question remains though, if in order to recharge a deep cycle battery
it requires 1.25 times more amp-hours, couldn't this be solved by the
addition of a high-output gen/alt(Super 75??)
