Subject: RE: [T2] Chinese Tires

&gt; I have been using Taiwan/China tires for years.NanKing seem to
&gt; have been the first. I got over 40,000 miles out of a set before 1
seperated.
&gt; I now have some ChingHaugh, which handle good but are real noisey.
&gt; On my F#_at_d tow truck I have Kumho which are great tires.


I have used Korean Hankook &quot;D &quot;load range tires on a couple of VW
Busses/Vanagons and been very happy with them.
