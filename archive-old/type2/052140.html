&gt; A collegue in the veterinary field has a dental unit that uses compressed

&gt; used is from a late 60s bug! They report the bottle is NLA. Any ideas other
&gt; that a junk yard where we can find one? She does not want a used bottle for
&gt; fear of chemical residue. Would a bus bottle work if a new one can be found?
&gt; Any pack rats out there have one in their stash?

My dentist has one of those, too.
One nice thing about dealing with VW's is that EVERY part has a part number on
it.
Get the number; post it to this or the vintage list.
