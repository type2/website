Don,

Let's see if I can remember....

Depends on how far you want to take it....

No AFM box.(lose the intake restriction.) MS uses a throttle position 
		sensor.
No stock ECU box.  Use MS ECU

No double relay.  Use MS Relay package.

If you want, you can loose the resistors for the injectors....although
it may be a more robust system if you leave them.

Lose the stock temperature sensor.  Use the GM replacement in the air 
	stream.

I may have missed something along the way.

The good/bad news.......

You have complete contol over the ECU, which means you can program
pretty much everything....the bad news is the same....you can do harm to 
your engine by programming it to not inject enough gas at high speed.
Of course, you can do that with a carb as well if you try....


Go here to learn more.

 That is beautiful. Absolutely beautiful.
&gt; 
 Now, what is the benefit for a stock configuration to using MS as opposed to
 the stock computer?
