Hi Sarah,

This is my 3rd bus, but first Westy.  I've never worked on a vehicle at all 
before.  They are very easy to work on, especially if you get Muir's book.   
Any non-VW driver will tell you that it is a joke, but it's not.....believe 
me.

Good luck, Sarah and nice hearing from you.  Keep me posted on your progress 
and I'll keep you posted on mine.  We may meet up somewhere at one of the 
camping get-togethers.
