Subject:      Re: '71 Bus rear bumper

FWIW, the rear blade - not the brackets - is the same from '66 - '72.  I've seen
a '71 bus with a '66 - '67 rear bumper on it, complete w/ overrider tubes and
bumper guards.  And Heck, if you don't give a hoot about stock, a '58 - '65 rear
blade will work too. Though I imagine you'd probably get a lot of &quot; Hey dude,
you got du wrong bumpa on thar.&quot;
