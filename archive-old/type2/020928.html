I have an almost complete(minus ,front kick panels!) almost new(bvrown
basket weave) standard Van interior(missing middle seat,also!) for sale.
No tears or really wear, but I am changing everything to gray
to match the 2 fronts I was given(lumbar support, fits my fat old body
better!). These seats are almost perfect, with all panels like new! Make
me a reasonable offer, as in what you might have to trade(VW stuff, a
Rabbit or Jetta Diesel motor!?_at_!) or a right amount of cash. The
upholstery was done professionally, and I will send pictures to an
interested person.

Chris.

PS: You must come and get them as the set is too heavy to ship. I will
help you install it if you like, for free|!
