Subject: Fw: Bug engine in Westy

Just thought of one possible hiccup........ believe you said it was a 69 bug
engine into a 71 bus, right?  The 71 was the first year for power brakes.
If you look at your 71 engine now, you will see a vacuum hose ~3/4&quot; o.d.
connecting to your intake manifold lower left of the carb.

You'll need to make provision for the vacuum takeoff in your 69 intake
manifold.  This is not difficult but requires drilling and brazing to be
done nicely [tho you could get away with soft soldering].

Remember the power brake booster really HATES GAS FUMES.... just don't ask
me how I know this!  There is a check valve in the vacuum line which
prevents gas from being sucked into the booster when you turn off the
engine.  It's probably located within the first few inches of your vacuum
line betw intake manifold and booster.  Treat this with great respect.  Make
sure it's functioning correctly!
