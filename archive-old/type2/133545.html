&gt; If you were going to build a 2.0 out of used parts (refurbished parts)... What parts combo would you build. first, this imaginary engine would not be running the stock fuel injection. It would either be MegaSquirt or Dellorto DRLA carbs.
&gt;
&gt; Engine has to have heat and be an all weather engine - not just a southern California engine.

find yourself a 1500S motor, these are like hens teeth but the one I had
in &quot;stock&quot; configuration tested at 96hp.

then to dream I would swap out the twin carbs for some form of FI,
probably megasquirt. and a MSD ignition.

that ought to be enough to make your beetle fly...  it got my Avenger
(fibrefab) up to 112mph before I chickened out, it was still willing to go
more...
