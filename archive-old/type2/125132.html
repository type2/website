Subject: Faucet

Does anyone know if the sink/stove counter top that raises and lowers in my 76
deluxe is supposed to clear the faucet spout when closed?  Mine does not.
I just installed a replacement faucet that looks like the original and the
hinges on the top appear to be straight and correct.
Maybe your supposed to pull out the spout when closing the counter top?  My
old one that came with the bus was just laying in sink when I got it.
The campmobile manual does not mention it.
Thanks,
Mike
