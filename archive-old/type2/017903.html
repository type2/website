&gt; I had a recent addition to my VW family, but the PO lost he title he had from that a PPO had signed over and of course he doesn't remember the name or address of that PPO.

Check to see if your state requires a title for an older vehicle.  Here
in Georgia, when I went to register and title my '77 westy, the nice
woman at the counter told me that titling was not necessary because of
the age of my bus.  There seemed to be no advantages to spending the
hundred plus dollars for a piece of worthless paper stating that I owned
the bus.  The registration was sufficient, if in a pinch I may need to
produce the bill of sale if I wanted to sell.  Since I plan to buried in
my bus in about 100 years (i think that living to 137 seems to be about
right, ask me when I am 136:) this should not be an issue.
