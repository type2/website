I have had my 70 Westy for about 8 weeks now. It is time for a tune up. I 
read on my carburator Solex H30-31Pict , is this a 31 Pict-3 ?.  Also where 
on the distributor do you read the number, all I see on mine is Bosch.. made 
in Germany. 
Also does anyone know of VW shows or events  coming up in Northern California.
