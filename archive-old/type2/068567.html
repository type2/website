Hi!

The Bus Stop is a division of Rocky Mountain Motor Works and they are 
REALLY cool people to do business with. Here's some info:

sales:  1 - 800 - 544 - 5357
FAX:     1 - 800 - 544 - 1084
Customer Service:   1 - 800 - 544 - 1065

Just give 'em a call and they'll send you a catalog... now, when you 
get the catalog, go through it and with a BRIGHT red pen, circle 
EVERYTHING you want and leave it laying around so your significant 
other will find it and buy everything for you for Christmas!

Great timing!

Have fun!
