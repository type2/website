Hi Richard -

When Scott (the VWG owner) and I sat down and compared a number of headlight
switches, we found that the 71-77 Std Bug/71-72 Super Beetle/71-74
Ghia/71-73 Type 3 and the 71-79 Bus Headlight Switches were basically the
same with the following exceptions:

1.  The Escutcheon (or securing nut) to the dashboard were different sizes,
ie: 10mm for the Type 2 Bus, 14mm for the Type 1/3.

2.  For some strange reason the Taillight Circuits on the Type 1/3 Switch
for Left and Right Side were separate, but not so for the Type 2 Bus.

To be sure to keep tooling costs down, Exception #1 above was a no brainer -
make some using the 10mm Escutcheon and some with the 14mm Escutcheon.

In our research as to Exception #2, we could find no reason why VW chose the
circuit differences for the Taillights.  So in keeping with streamlining
production, we chose to use the Type 1 Configuration for the Terminals so
that the switch could be used for either model, dependant of course on the
Escutcheon Thread.  We were kinda surprised VW never went this way and have
had no problems throughout testing as to possible overloads in the sliding
plates within the switch.

So in short, the 71-79 Type 2 Bus Customer can connect to either terminal
58L or 58R for their Taillights without worrying about possible overloads.

At VWG, we make most of the VW Headlight switches now to cover the following
models:

311-941-531A    Type 1 &amp; 3 61-67, Type 2 68-70
311-941-531B    Type 1 &amp; 3 68-70
113-941-531E    Std Bug 71-77, Super Beetle 71-72, Ghia 71-74, Type 3 71-73
211-941-531E    Type 2 71-79

Why did we decide to make these switches?  Most of the 3rd world copies that
were being made were usually minus the Terminal 57 for the Parking Light
circuit for the early Type 1/3 models (as well as it's used for the
Indicator Light on the Dashpod of the 68-79 Bus [see the Bentley wiring
diagrams],) as well as many of them wouldn't work at all!  It got
frustrating to sell aftermarket made switches that weren't worth the plastic
and metal they were made out of.  So we decided to make a virtual copy of
these, as close to the way they were originally made.  We've been VERY happy
with these since we intro'd them late last year.

We are in the planning stages right now on Pre-68 Type 2 Headlight Switches
due late this year or in 2005.

Please keep in mind that VWG does not sell retail, only wholesale.  But you
can easily obtain these and other VWG products from Ronnie at Type2Parts_dot_com
in Lake Havasu, AZ, Walter at Bus Boys in Redding, CA or Ron at the Bus
Depot on the east coast as well as a host of other VW shops and parts houses
we're selling to these days.

As I have been off-list for awhile, I did not see your Type 2 List post, but
I am glad to have received your forwarded inquiry regarding this.  If you
want, please forward the text above to the list showing the
reply/explanation to let everyone know I'm still alive and kicking.  It's
been fun since my 4-way heart bypass in Oct 2002 working to have all this
neat stuff to make that's getting hard to find these days.

Keep on Bussin' :-)
