Can you explain to me how these work?  I've never seen one.  How is it different
from 
&quot;regular&quot; points?

I've been planning on writing about this, so I guess now is as good as ever.

The Pertronix system uses a Hall Effect device to detect a magnetic field above
a certain threshold, the output of which is essentially a transistor that turns
on or off in response to the Hall Effect device.  The magnetic field is
generated by a collar that is slipped over the cam lobes on the distributor
rotor shaft.  I am not sure if the magnetic device utilizes the existing cam
lobes to shape the magnetic field or not.  The advantage of using the cam lobes
for field shaping would be that, if your distributor has the characteristic
retard on #3, this would be retained by the new magnetic system.  My system is
installed on a Bosch 009, which I believe, does not have the retard on #3, so I
couldn't verify if the lobes affect the field shape or not.

The pickup that contains the Hall Effect device, transistor, shielding and any
other necessary circuitry is contained in a device that mounts in place of the
existing points, replacing them completely (apologies to Bob Hoover, who prefers
the route of using a capacitive discharge (CD) system that uses the points as a
trigger, but removes the heavy load of the coil from the points so that they
don't wear).  I don't think that this system would work on some of the older
distributors that use two piece points and have the post permanently installed
on the points mounting plate.

Minuses:
- -My 009 distributor uses a square grommet for the points wire to pass through
the distributor body, but the Pertronix system supplies a round grommet for this
application, so the fit is not perfect.
- -Said grommet interferes a little with the distributor cap, which might make a
little trimming necessary.
- -The magnetic collar prevents the rotor from seating down as far on the rotor
shaft as much as it would with normal points.  I looked into this a little and
felt that this might allow the rotor to rotate slightly on the shaft, so I filed
some of the length off the rotor, allowing it to seat all the way down.
- -If you follow the directions, you won't be able to get everything installed in
an 009 distributor due to lack of space for manuevering things around.  I ended
up taking the magnetic collar off about five times before I was done with
everything.
- -They supply a spacer to locate the pickup at the correct height relative to the
magnetic collar, but it is difficult to determine if you need it or not, as it
is very difficult to see the references they indicate when everything is
installed.  I THINK that mine was too low without the spacer, and too high with
the spacer, but closer to requirement with the spacer.  It would be nice if they
supplied an intermediate spacer, and put a reference marker on the side of the
pickup body, so it would be easy to determine if you were in or out of
specification.
- -The wires that come with it are way too long for the standard upright engine
application.
- -Cost about $70.

Pluses:
- -Never again have to adjust points.
- -Unnaffected by the dampness of where I live (next to a creek in the coastal
redwoods, where we get about 60 inches of rain in the winter).  I always had
trouble with points getting damp if the bus sat for over a week in the winter
(which unfortunately, it does a lot).
- -Compatible with any high energy or CD ignition system that normally uses
points, so I can still add a CD system later.  (See Hoover's sermon on this)
- -Can still use static timing methods.
- -Comes fully wired and ready to install, didn't need to fabricate anything.

Opinions:
- -It appears that the electronic module acts just like points; that is, at some
magnetic threshold the 'contacts' open to fire the spark, and at a similar threshold
on the other side of the magnetic lobe, the 'contacts' close to charge the coil,
this is why static timing methods can still be used.
- -From my knowledge of Hall Effect devices and magnetic fields, I believe that it
might be possible to fine tune dwell, though I haven't tried this.  When I
checked dwell, my old dwell-tach indicated about 55 degrees, meaning the
'contacts' were staying open too long.  I think that if I increase the gap from
the rotor collar to the pickup, this would decrease the number of degrees that
the magnetic field was within the threshold for opening the 'contacts', thus
decreasing dwell.  I am going to look into this the next time I check my plugs,
though in the 009, there is not much room for adjusting the gap between the
pickup and the magnetic collar.
- -I believe that the pickup device could probably be made smaller, making
installation easier.
- -I didn't notice any change in performance or gas mileage with the installation
of this system.  The main reason I went with the pointless ignition was for easy
winter starting.
