Subject: Re: [T2] Generator question on 71 Westy

Trey
Its not a bug/bus issue but rather a 30 vs 38 amp generator issue.
The 38 amp gen is longer and requires a mounting plate with a recessed
area. Likely you have a mismatch. If it sticks out too far then you prob
have a 38 amp gen and flat 30 amp backing plate. If it doesnt stick out
far enough then you prob have a 30 amp gen and recessed 38 amp plate.

I hope this is clear.



&gt; I bought a 71 Westy 2 months ago, I noticed in tightening the generator belt
&gt; on my first maiden voyage that it seemed odd the generator pulley was not in
&gt; line with the crankshaft pulley. I think the generator might be a bug
&gt; generator as the Bosch number on it is 113 903 031P. Can anyone confirm this
&gt; for me ? I heard that a bug generator is shorter  (also it's stamped 30
&gt; amps) and can cause problems. I'm thinking that the PO put a bug engine in
&gt; the bus....
