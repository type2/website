Subject: Re: [T2] I just stripped the interior of my 73 Westy...

That's some tall cabinetry! But I bet it's real efficient for storage. I've 
also always favored designs I've seen that have side facing seats for best 
interior space utilization, but I am reluctant to use the configuration 
because I think it contributes to passenger motion sickness.

I also like the table configuration and the way it makes for a very large 
bed.
