&gt; Uh oh, this is the first I heard of this! My recommendation is to give the

Since I have a vested interest in the psychic state of the hubcap (I don't want
it to fling itself out the passenger window in a moment of despair), I have a
plan to restore said wheel cover to its fullest mojo-ness:  

A ladyfriend of mine does a Native American smudging/cleansing ritual with a
sage bundle; I will ask her to perform said ceremony over and around the hubcap
when it's handed off to me.  The aforementioned lady can't figure out why her
life path keeps crossing those of VW nuts like me - she'll figure it out
eventually  ;)
