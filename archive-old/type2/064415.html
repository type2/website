Subject: seat help needed

Hey all,
Today I tried to recushion the passenger seat in my '78.  Only problem
was, I couldn't get the damn seat out.  I tried just about everything I
could try.  The innermost runner is ready to go but the outer runner is
completely stuck.  I know somebody's dealt with this before, how can I
get this sucker unstuck?

Thanks in advance,
Sean
