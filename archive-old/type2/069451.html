I wouldn't even bother attempting this nut removal with any socket
unless you've got a really, really, really long lever.  Maybe something
about 6 feet would deliver enough leverage.  Otherwise get the
sledgehammer wheel nut removal tool available from RMMW and VW shops. 
The only bad thing is that when reassembling the wheel and re-torqueing
it you have to guess how tight it is.  After a few well-placed whacks
with a 10lb sledge you can usually tell when it's &quot;tight enough.&quot;  Or
after the nut breaks...

My $.02.
