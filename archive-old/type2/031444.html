&gt; so, i thought, sh*t, i've never tried to lock this door, because there was 
&gt; no need since it has been sitting on private property.  anyway, of course, 
&gt; the key for the front doors/ignition doesn't work the hatch door, or for 
&gt; that matter, the engine door compartment.
&gt; 
&gt; so..._dot_can i get a locksmith or someone to make a key for these locks?  or 
&gt; do i have to buy a new lock?  if so, can i just buy the lock and key and 
&gt; not the whole handle?

it is fairly simple to rekey the tumblers in the locks, I (and others I
believe) have posted and listed in the (former) archives complete
instructions on how to rekey the tumblers.

if it isn't found I will look in my personal file and see if I kept a copy
of the post, and I will repost it.
