Subject: Re: [T2] smelly noisy brakes

&gt; I recently got my bus back from impound (expired registration) they towed it 
&gt; by the front wheels. Now my brake pads (which are new from before this trip 
&gt; from NC to NJ) have started squeling sometimes. When I push on the brakes it 
&gt; goes away. It is not there all the time, but enough to make me concerned. 
&gt; When we stop you can really smell it too. It is definitely coming from the 
&gt; wheels. It didn't do this the first half of the trip before I got towed.

some compounds on brakes will smell (but not squeal) for the first few
hundred miles, this is normal
