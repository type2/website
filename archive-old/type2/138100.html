&gt; Without an inspection, and risking a controversial wild guess, have in

Doyt is right about this. $5k is an average, and assuming you pay a 
fair and reasonable price, you can deduct the purchase price from the 
$5k.

The fact that you know the bus is a Champagne edition means (I assume) 
that the seller knows this too. Unless it is in very good condition, 
don't let the &quot;special edition&quot; feature of this bus skew the price too 
much. A Champagne edition bus should only skew the price upwards if it 
is reasonably complete and in good condition. Otherwise, it's just a 
'78 possibly with bad (an expensive to replace) heat exchangers and 
exhaust, and with hydraulic lifters which may or may not have kept the 
valves properly adjusted.
