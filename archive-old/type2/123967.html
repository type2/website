&gt; couple of months back because the demand for the parts has dropped so low
and
&gt; it was wasting space. I stopped at another German repair shop and got a
&gt; similar story.
&gt;
&gt; Not that the junkyards are getting any easier but all of this makes me
&gt; apprecitate folks like Ken Madson of The Bus Co. and Joe Mitchell of
Busted
&gt; Bus who save these valuable baywindow parts from the recycler to keep our
&gt; buses on the roads.


Richard,

Sorry to hear about the crushing. Almost as bad as the guy that told me
about all the 4 cam Porsche Spyder engines he crushed back in the 60's -
guess that is why they get $30 - $50,000 for them today.

Yes, Ken at Busco has come up with some doghouse parts and body trim strips
for my 70. Reasonable prices, quick delivery and a nice guy to boot.
