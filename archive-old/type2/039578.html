Subject: Re: Fuel Injection to Carbs?

&gt; From: Shawn Overstreet &lt;wlfman37_at_yahoo_dot_com&gt;
&gt; 
&gt; One other question.  Are there any
&gt; members out there that have switched from fuel
&gt; injection to carberators?

--&gt; I have.  I don't recommend it except as a very last resort.  When
(if?) the archives come back up, do some searches on the subject and
you'll get lots of reasons why.  It *can* be made to run, and run pretty
well, with carburators, but it requires a lot of fiddling, and it will
*never* be as smooth, as powerful, or as easy to start as an engine with a
properly functioning fuel injection system.  When the FI system on my van
was working right, I could start it with one turn of the key even in
weather that was well below freezing.  Not only that, but I could drive it
off almost immediately, with little of the sputtering that a carburated
engine has in cold weather.

As far as your problem with the engine running full throttle and not
slowing down, is your throttle plate stuck open?
