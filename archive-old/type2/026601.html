Niall:

I just put a Compufire module in my 71 bus, stock 1600 DP, and it runs
great.  When you look at the module and magnetic donut thing, it makes you
wonder how this thing could send a spark out to the spark plugs, but work it
does.  I had trouble at first because of two things:  

1)Make sure the magnetic donut is seated down as far as it can go.  Don't
push on it really hard or pound on it with anything, because it'll crack
(believe me).  If you get it seated right, there should be probably less
than 1/8 inch space between the magnetic donut and the electronic module.
Also, make sure you put it on with the correct side up (look at the pictures
in the Compufire literature).  If you have any uneasiness about any of this,
call Compufire tech support.

2) You might have to file or sand off about 1/16 of an inch on the bottom of
your rotor.  I had to do this to be able to push my rotor all the way down
onto it's shaft in the distributor.  If the rotor doesn't fit all the way
down on the shaft, the distributor cap won't fit properly, and it will work
poorly or not at all.

Also, do NOT hook up the red and black wires from the compufire module to
the wrong terminals on the coil.  The module will blow or burn with very
smelly smoke instantly (believe me).

As far as the high dwell number you get, it doesn't matter.  That's the
beauty of electronic ignition.  E-mail me if you need any more specific
info.

Subject: [T2] Compufire dwell - does it matter?


I've scanned the archives looking for an answer to this question and merely
came up with more vague questions and no definitive results.  When I
installed the Compufire points, my dwell was 68 degrees.  For various other
reasons (perhaps this as well), the engine didn't run well, and I have since
switched back to points and gotten the engine tuned reasonably (new plugs,
oil, rotor etc...).  I would like to put the e-points back in, and was
wondering if the high dwell is going to cause me troubles.  If it does
matter, is there a way to tune it?  Sounds like the 'air gap' method doesn't
work.

TIA,
Niall
