Had the same problem to solve when I used a 1800 head in my 78 bus.  Had to 
have the heads reworked with different valves and such for a 2 ltr....the vw 
mechanic used head studs to seal the holes (these are the long studs that 
bolt the head to the cylinder/engine) He double nutted  the stud and then 
screwed it into the hole  (this  is sounding kinda &quot;X&quot; rated, isn't it?),
then he cut the stud off at the head level. They blew out in a couple of 
years (literally).  I replaced them with a type of &quot;mollybolt&quot; you get at Ace 
Hardware...it's a 2 inch long aluminum sleeve (same diameter as the hole), 
with a tapered lead bullet attached to a steal bolt with a nut and washer on 
top...as you turned the nut clockwise the bullet travels up the inside of the 
sleeve and solidly filled the hole...you just have to make sure that the 
sleeve and bullet don't extend down the hole too far and hit the rear of your 
exhaust valve...no way will it come out ...you also have to customise your 
tin to accomadate this extra protruding hardware.
