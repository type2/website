&gt; 
&gt; I found &lt;with the help of a seemingly knowledgeable
&gt; sales person&gt; a 1.2v LED that could be used with a
&gt; resistor (I forget which size), that produced
&gt; 3,000mcd, vs. the 23mcd that my test-subject had. I
&gt; assume that this is not a linear projection (the
&gt; 3,000mcd is not actually 130.4 times brighter than the
&gt; 23mcd), but that it's still *substantially* brighter.

--&gt; *All* LEDs are basically 1.2V devices.  A resistor is used in series
to set the proper current.  The proper amount of current varies depending
on the LED type, but usually a 470 ohm resistor is about right for running
an LED off a 12V system. This gives a current of just over 20 milliamps at
12 volts.  

To figure the correct resistor value, subtract 1.2 from the voltage you'll
be running the LED off of, then divide by the desired current in amps (1
mA = 0.001 A). Pick the closest standard 1/2 watt resistor value. 

&gt; So here's the current problem (no pun intended); all
&gt; the LEDs I see are colored (red, yellow, green, blue),
&gt; but the lights I want to replace are clear... Also,
&gt; the 3,000mcd is only available in red. The other
&gt; colors drop substatially in intensity/brightness from
&gt; there.

--&gt; I'd probably go with super-bright red LEDs behind the red lamps, and
the brightest green and blue you can find behind the others.  White LEDs
are also available now, but I'm not sure how expensive they are or how
bright.

For the gauge lighting, you may want to stick with bulbs.  You need a
*lot* of light over a wide area for this, and the bright LEDs get their
brightness partially by focusing the light in a narrow beam. To brighten
the stock lighting, start by taking apart the gauge cluster and
re-painting the white inside of the metal backing plate.  It tends to
yellow and get dirty with age.  Check for a filter inside, too.  Mine
actually had a green one that was so faded, it didn't make the light look
green anymore, just dimmer.  Make sure all the lamp contacts are clean and
tight, so you don't waste power there.

As far as your VDO gauges go, don't use a standard potentiometer.  The
power requirements for gauge lighting are too high -- it'll burn up. 
This is what I'd try.  Buy a package of rectifier diodes at Radio
Shack.  Get ones rated at a few amps.  Put one in series with the gauge
lighting circuit of the VDO gauge.  This will drop the voltage to the
bulbs by 0.7 volts, dimming them and prolonging their life.  If one diode
doesn't dim them enough, use two in series.  The band on the diode housing
should point towards ground for proper polarization (otherwise, nothing
will light.)

If any of this isn't clear, email me and I'll try to explain it better.
