Subject: re: shavings in oil
To: type2_at_lenti.type2_dot_com

Old RAF engine fitter's trick: did you run a magnet through them?
If they're crankshaft, pistons or rings, they're steel, bearings are bronzed 
or some such thing. But they sound like crank bearing shavings. Does your oil 
light flicker on at a hot idle after a long run?
