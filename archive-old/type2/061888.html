Subject: timing marks

There is more than a little confusion about the timing marks on a VW pulley.
Maybe this will help a little.  Standard VW upright engines came with a
variety of marks, depending on lots of variables.  There were so many
variations that VW finally quit putting timing marks on replacement pulleys.
They just put a TDC mark on the rear lip of the pulley and left it up to the
technician to mark the pulley for the particular engine that the replacement
pulley was going on.  To help with this they issued a special tool, VW 206,
one of which I happen to have.  It's a neat little stamped steel plate
that's curved to conform to the curve of the pulley and has degree marks
stamped into it.  To use it you just line up the zero mark then mark the
pulley with whatever timing marks you wish on the front lip of the pulley.
On the replacement pulleys TDC was marked with a gentle, concave depression
on the rear lip.  About what you could make with a 1/4 inch round file.  The
timing marks are always small indentations on the front lip, about what you
could make with a small three-cornered file.  The distance, or chord
(straight line), from TDC to 7 1/2 degrees is about .440&quot;, 11.3 mm, or a
little over 7/16&quot;.  TDC to 30 degrees is about 1.760&quot;, 1 and 25/32&quot;, or 45
mm (or so).
This is on a 7&quot; pulley.  If you have a pulley with unknown marks, just find
TDC, mark it, and use the above measurements to identify the marks.
All of these measurements are approximate, because I'm measuring them with a
hand held vernier caliper.  I couldn't figure out any way to measure them
exactly.
goforit!
