Wow,

Weren't you lucky!

Had this happen more than once myself.  There was usually a little more
warning with my experiences, hearing  noise for a short while coming from
the engine compartment before it went

Was the pulley one of those *aftermarket* gold in color, made in Mexico
type?  They do tend to have faults!

German pulleys are NLA but, you can try: www.interstatevw_dot_com or
www.bustedbus_dot_com, and get a good used German pulley complete to replace it.
It should have a VW mark stamped on it if it's genuine.

Continued good luck!

&gt; Well I was making my maiden voyage of any distance in my newly-acquired 71
&gt; Westy this weekend heading out to the Super Jam in Mohnton, PA. Everything
&gt; was fine for the first 60 miles, then I heard a loud noise. Sounded like I
&gt; ran over something metal in the road. The bus is still running...I look at
&gt; the dash and saw the generator light come on, so I stopped. Walked around
&gt; back, opened the engine lid, and guess what I see? The alternator (yes,
alt.
&gt; not gen.) pulley has come off and is ripped into a couple of big pieces.
&gt; Pieces must have shot all over because one cracked my distributor cap and
one
&gt; shot out the left side of the bus making a nice hole in the body. Ouch!
Belt
&gt; was still there and intact, as was inner pulley.
&gt;
&gt; Any idea what would cause this and how much trouble I'm in? The engine in
a
&gt; fairly new rebuild and I hadn't messed with the belt or pulley. Maybe I
&gt; should have. Anyway, I had it towed to a nearby shop. Have to say that an
80s
&gt; Vanagon passed me by, as did another 70s Westy. This was on Rt. 78 in
&gt; Bethlehem, PA. I was kinda bothered that no one stopped, but maybe next
time.
