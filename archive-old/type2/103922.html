Subject: Re: [T2] Aftermarket Pull starter?

&lt;&lt; Hello,
I have a faint memory of a VW fitted with a lawn mower type of pull starter 
on an upright beetle type motor.
Has any one ever seen this or was I halucinating on some bad herbs?
Keep in mind this was in the &quot;Hang ten&quot; foot shaped gas pedal and R. Crumb 
&quot;Keep on trucking&quot; days of the early 1970s so anything goes.

Even if you could 'attach' a pull starter to the crank pulley, would you
like a loose rope anywhere near a rotating fanbelt...Besides, I have
enough trouble starting my 6 hp wood chipper...
