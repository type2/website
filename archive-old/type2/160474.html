Subject: Re: [T2] how to fix Running Hot

 &gt; i still dont know what the right jets would be for my engine 1800

What jets have you currently got?

Are all 4 cylinders firing?

I had a similar situation with a weber progressive with one cylinder 
running lean due to a vacuum leak from a split rubber boot. I had 
adjusted the idle mixture unaware that I had the leak. The clue was 
that 3 of the spark plugs were black and one was not! :)

Cheers,

Martin
