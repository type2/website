Subject: Re: [T2] She doesn't want to go camping?!

From: &lt;tjaspers_at_ameripath_dot_com&gt;
&gt; So... with that in mind... short of getting a new future wife, is there
any way to convince the SO to go on a camping trip.

I'd like to suggest something here, but I'm liable to get zapped by my wife
from right through the Heavenly gates.

Let's say that we discovered that camping + tent + together = :O)

Sort of a... ah... nice sort of thing, that... well... {OW!}
