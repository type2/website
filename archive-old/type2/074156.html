&gt; Those of us unlucky enough to have Vanagons instead of bays have this
weight
&gt; distribution problem even worse.

&gt; One could just as well fill sand bags if you can find the nice heavy bags.
&gt; The problem with snow, of course, is that it's not very heavy.

Try your local farm feed supply, one that blends their own feeds. They have
the woven polypropylene bags in the 50 and 100 pound size. These bags are
tough. I make bags like this for a living, but half this size and twice as
strong; they're used for packaging explosives for the mining industry. A
little small for using as sandbags, but talk about tough!
