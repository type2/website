Hey Brian,

I found the exact same thing when I changed the oil in a recently purchased
1600. I had seen metal shavings before, but the presence of this aluminum
foil looking stuff had me perplexed so I opened it up for a rebuild.  I was
amazed to find the bearing at the #3 connecting rod was completely gone. It
was like it had never been installed.  Bearings are actually layers of some
wierd metal that I can't remember the name of and this one has probably
disentagrated into the paper thin shavings you found.  Don't drive anymore
or serious damage will result. 

Good luck,
