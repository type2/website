&gt;feel the end of the plug in there.  So, how would you possibly ever get it
&gt;out?  The only solutions I see are a) turn the bus upside down and shake
real
&gt;hard, or b) pretend it didn't happen, get a new plug and a new socket and
try
&gt;again.   Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.


Did this today myself.  3 things.  First to remove I have 2 different
magnetic pullers each more than capable of removing a socket and plug, they
were &quot;2 pound&quot; telescoping pullers though the magnet tips are very small
1/4&quot; diam by 1/2&quot;, from my FLAPS.

Second. So that this does not happen again, 2 good techniques.  First buy a
set of &quot;locking&quot; extensions to use on 2 and 4.  They are a bit expensive but
nice to have.

Last if you can't find those I do this trick.  I install the plug using a
standard socket with rubber booty, but only push the plug in ever so gently,
usually not even into the socket far enough for the hex to be on the plug.
Only enough that you are sure it won't drop out of the socket.  Doing this I
just gently get it threaded a turn or so then wiggle the socket back out (I
find this easier and less risky as far as dropping the socket than the other
method of grabbing the socket later with long pliers) then I take a socket
I've popped the rubber insert out of such that it will not grab the plug and
tighten with torque wrench to 18 N-m or whatever your book calls.  Then
easily pull the socket out on the extension since there is no boot grabbing.
Works well and I always seem to have 2-3 spark plug sockets around anyway.

Well one more thing a final idea, the cheapo Harbor Freight wobble extension
set is great for this and so many other things.  They are cheap, of better
than average HF Chinese quality (I've had in excess of 350 ft-lb on the 1/2&quot;
ones many times), and can really save your ass in many instances where full
universals have you cursing.  Plus you have to get the angle just right on
T4 plugs, angle is like towards the center of the head in both planes, trick
is that sometimes the tin is far enough off that it doesn't want to permit
you to get that angle just right cause it rubs the socket on one side or
another, or catches the socket when you pull it back out, the wobble
extensions correct for this and if you get them close you can easily start
the plug with finger pressure.
