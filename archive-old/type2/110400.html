Subject: timing 

    I'm putting a '79 CA. bus that I just bought this month back together.  
The DPO
removed all the smog equipment, and...well it's a long list. I've been 
surfing the
archive and my Bentley about the timing. The engine is 2.0 liter, FI. The 
timing strip was missing, but, I found one at the junk yard. The timing was at 7 
BTDC. 
According to Bentley this engine should be 5 ATDC w/ hoses connected. When I 
set this, the engine ran smoother, but, seems to have a loss in power. Also a 
longer
&quot;pull&quot; to rev when you step on the gas. It seemed to me that you might 
actually get
a little more power with the ignition advanced. Not retarded. Now the idle 
should be 
850 to 950 RPM. But when I turn the adjusting screw out, 850 is the highest 
RPM
I can get out of it. That just don't sound right. Any comments?
