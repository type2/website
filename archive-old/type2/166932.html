Subject: Re: [T2] Vanagon Alloys on a Bay

I don't know that our busses are that critical, but
many if not most of the lesser-stoutly made vehicles
need exact torque specs for the moving parts to clear
properly in all conditions but especially for brakes
to clear properly and to brake evenly. I learned this
on Aerostars. They are extremely critical of proper
wheel torque. - BaH

 Well, you guys never cease to surprise me.  I saw a
 post of Karl's about torquing lug nuts.  At the time
 I just chuckled knowing that Karl is somewhat of a
 perfectionist.  I've never in my life heard of
 anybody torquing lug nuts.  I always just got them
 tight with a lug wrench and didn't worry about it. 
 Is this something VW specific or have I been risking
 mine and somebody else's lives all these years in
 the many vehicles I've owned having lost only one
 lug nut that I can remember?   Learn something new
 here every day.  Thanks....KR
