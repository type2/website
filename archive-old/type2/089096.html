Yes or maybe, mine is a 1977 Westfalia exported to Venezuela and as yours it
has a very unusual assembly to be a '77, front disc brakes but no servo, the
brake fluid reservoir is located under the driver seat then a pipe is
connected to the master cylinder, 1600 DP, no kitchen, no A/C, the electric
circuit does not correspond to any of the wire diagram listed in the Bentley
bus manual, the rest of the vehicle is the same as the American version I
owned a '76 about five years ago.
