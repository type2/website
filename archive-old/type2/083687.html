Subject: Re: [T2] Roadtrippin' with the '71: valve surprises, &quot;the lurch&quot;
 AND free parking! (long)

&gt; I'm not really sure of the status of the valve. It's #3E, has been getting
&gt; tight almost since the engine was new. Strange, considering it has a

Hmm. Ive been having the same sort of prob with #2E, SP head. now at 9000
miles from new. Im checking again this weekend.

&gt; much about the valve. Got home on Monday and checked them all. That one had
&gt; about .005 of *negative* clearance (in other words it was holding the valve

Ive had this as well but didnt know how much but it was closed up.

&gt; that valve clearances get larger when the engine's hot, so I'm theorizing
&gt; that even after stretching, #3E was still closing on the seat (albeit

I think this is backward. You set them open because they close when hot.
Im guessing they close to around .002 because one of the old specs was to
set the valves at .004. I think 006 is to be conservative and safe.
Anyone?

&gt; One bit of very good news: I seem to have solved a very vexing problem
&gt; that's been haunting the engine for a year now. Occasionally, with no rhyme
&gt; or reason, the old bitch would lose power briefly under load, causing her to
&gt; buck and lurch and generally act like the Millenium Falcon at Warp 5

Interesting because I have had a similar problem and thought it was fuel
filter (no) or carb (no) and then perhaps coil (which I swapped) but I
also found the tight valve at the same time. I wonder if the tight valve,
expanded by heat, could be causing the bucking and lack of power above a
certain rpm.
Sheer speculation though.

So Mike are these new SP heads? Or which.
good luck
