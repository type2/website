&gt;So, does anybody know a good source for these items?  Can they be found at 
&gt;my FLAPS as a generic item, or are they VW-specific?  If a VW part, are they 
&gt;available from one of the many mail-order places out there?  Or can they 
&gt;only be found in the dreaded land of N.L.A. (with apologies to anyone living 
&gt;near Glendale or Burbank)?

The backing plates and spring spreader were available from the dealer not long ago (ATE at least). What part are you referring to?
