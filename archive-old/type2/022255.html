Thanks - I learned something from your message. It's not a Champagne 
Edition (I think). No velour anywhere in there. It's got the ugly mostly 
green plaid &amp; vinyl and tweed (?) fabric.

It does however have the chrome bumpers with the rubber impact strips. I 
still have the dealer papers and will check to see if the seats are wrong 
or special orders (why would you special order those colors? &lt;grin&gt;)

We're not changing anything that can't be changed back with simple paint.

(Not even the mechanical changes I want to make will be a big deal - I'm 
saving everything, and no cutting!)

It needed paint and it was a good time to do a color swap. The outside 
color had already been changed once to a generic burgundy.

Will probably stay with the brown dash inside.

In my opinion, of all the VW buses I have had the opportunity to play with, 
I like the '78 Westy the best.

Thanks for your time.




&gt;If your dash and other vinyl is brown, you probably have a Champagne
&gt;Edition Westy which was Dakota Beige (L13A) and Agate Brown.  Usually
&gt;had the chrome bumpers and could come with a velour-type upholstery.
&gt;I did see one done in reddish interior seats, brown door panels, and
&gt;brown dash.  Those brown dashes are very rare and, if you change it out
&gt;to the standard black, you should save it if in good shape.  You'll have
&gt;to drill out you VIN plate and re-rivet it for USA/Italy considerations.
&gt;
&gt;The '78 CEs are condsidered by many the best Westy made are a pretty
&gt;desirable, even with those awful colors.  Probably should stay as close
&gt;to stock as possible.  In Europe, they command a pretty good price
&gt;compared to the USA (Japan too).
&gt;
&gt;Good luck,
&gt;Craig in CO
&gt;'78 Westies
