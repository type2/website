Subject: Re: [Re: [T2] Nose damage.]

I have an awfully hard time ( just from the pictures,) that this front
end is going to be pulled without a heavy dose of &quot;Cavin and Pavin after
words, which I am not an avocate of.

Sure it can be pushed and pulled, but from what I saw there is some
heavy mettal steretching here, and you'll never return it to it's
factory configuration or dimention's without, some heavy bondo work.

Phooey !!

Pullng the door post---yes
Sheet metal---no.
It looks as though it is stretched beyond the point of no return.
And if it has any rust on the other side of the damaged area, the panels
will break loose anyway, so get it over with and replace it.
Cut the spot welds, and replace the panel.
There is zinc laden weld through primer that would take care of the
possible corrosion problems.
