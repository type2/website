Tom Conner is your man.  He's in Deer Park, Washington, N. of Spokane.

He'll build exactly what you want, and you won't be disappointed.  He
usually has a booth/space at Oktobugfest in Puyallup WA, and that event is
the 2nd Sunday of October.

Here's his e-mail address:    racks_at_ior_dot_com

does anybody know of a company that makes good, durable custom roof racks? i
know there's one out there, but i don't know the company name. do they have
a website? (shameless plugs accepted) i am thinking about getting a rack for
my dormobile to go over the cab. that way i can have room for a spare tire
and maybe a propane tank. does anyone have any ideas for mounting a full
size propane tank outside of a bus besides storing one on a roof rack?
