Try the Bus Barn in Massachusetts
They have a home page and a toll free number but I can't recall either.
They have a patented screen for both front windows so you can leave
them wide open and don't have to worry about bugs. Great for air
movement.  Saw this on a 77 Westfalia at Westies in the Woods this past
spring.  I think it was $35 for the set of two.  I'm putting it on my list.
