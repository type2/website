Subject: VWOA...how far is too far?

Friday topic here,
    I caught on the news a few days ago that VWOA is now going after the 
Beatles. It seems that they have a bug in the background on one of their 
album covers. Now VWOA is going after them to either have the bug removed 
from the album cover, or pay them to keep it there.
    This is a record that has been out for 30 YEARS!!!    Will they stop at 
nothing??!!! A 30 year old record album cover???

      I wonder if they really, really know how many new car sales this has 
costed them.  Wife ended up with a Honda Odyssey instead of a Eurovan........
     I know we have covered this before, but what are they smoking???????
