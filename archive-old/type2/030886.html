&gt; I have a type II, with a type 4 engine. I thought I read in the archives

&gt; squareback engine in there? Or should it be that I have a Type II with a T4
&gt; engine? I've looked at a couple websites, but sometimes they contradict each
&gt; other. 

OK, one more time, and I hope I get it all right (I know I will be
corrected if wrong)

TYPE 1 - the beetle, and Karman Ghia, and Thing
TYPE 2 - the kombi, van, Westy Vanagon and all the various types of mods
TYPE 3 - the fastback, the squareback, the Notchback, the &quot;big&quot; Karmen
           Ghia, (has a 'type I pancake engine)
TYPE 4 - The 411 and 412  has a different design engine, this engine was
          used in later model TYPE 2s (an engine almost identical to
the Porsche 914) very few parts are interchangable withe the TYPE 1,
2,(early) and 3.

there were many variations, the type 1,2,3 engines were avaliable in 1200,
1300,1500,1600 &amp; 1700 versions (only the 1600 is avaliable Fuel Injected?)
the type 4 engines were avaliable in 1700, 1800 &amp; 2000ccs  Most type 4
engines were Fuel injected (except early type 2 1700's)

only the Type 4 1800, 2000cc and Type 1 1600cc were avaliable with
hydralic lifters  (??possibly some Type 4 1700 used in 411's??)

the confusion is most often caused by VW's putting the Type 4 engine into
later Type 2's long after the TYPE 4 car had been discontinued.  
all type 1 cars had type 1 engines
all type 3 cars had type 3 engines
all type 4 cars had type 4 engines

the type 2 van, used both a type 1 and a type 4 engine, there was never a
specific type 2 engine design


Hope this helps
