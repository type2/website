Hi yhi

No, I'm not saying that at the age of senenty one Isaac Hays will be 
half a man(insert wha wha sound here).
I'm posted the list to get some opinions on reconditioned half 
shafts.
I can get some from Napa for $80.00 ea.
I don't know what kind of boots they have on them but will delve 
further into that later.

So, whatcha think? Has anyone tried this route?

TIA
Tom
