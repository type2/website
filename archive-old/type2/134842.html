Subject: Re: [T2] Which is right or left?

&gt; I am buying body repair panels, which is right and left?
&gt; Drivers = ?
&gt; Passenger = ?

I love these questions, spatial definition is really the essence of what it 
means to be human.

There are many reasons I feel this way but, defining the space we occupy is 
an on going process.

Right and left are human spatial attributes that we use to associate with 
the things we interact with. Yet drivers and passenger side are only used to 
define the things we control to carry people while aligned abreast. It is 
best to look at both sides of the story.

First how can you compare a bus' body to ours,
the head is the front,
is a bus on its back or on its belly? For sure it is poised and ready for 
action, it must be on its belly. on all fours. (hmmmm) we are so human, 
aren't we?
Then I think we have it.
Almost, the drivers side is relative to your bus and most likely but not 
always the country of origin.

I would say the left is the left and the right is the right, then ask 
yourself this question, is the drivers side on the left or the right?

What do you have control over, and if there isn't anyone else in your bus 
with you, is there a right side anyway?
