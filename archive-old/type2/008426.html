Subject: Jalousie windows

O.K.       What I'm curious about is are these louvered *jalousie*
windows referred to as louvered windows or jalousie windows on original
Westy B.O.S and window stickers?  I remember looking at campers back in
the 70's on the showroom, but I don't ever remember what the window
stickers called them.  The salespeople referred to them as louvered, so
that's where I picked it up.  Are they referred to differently depending
on your geographical locale?  TIA......this will straighten it up for me.
