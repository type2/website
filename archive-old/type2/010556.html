&gt;Berg, or someone like them with assembly to
&gt;rigorouse factory spec by them or someone like them, like me or anyone else
&gt;that will not compromise DM.

So Doktor Tim,

You will build me &quot;an enhanced spec DM rebuild&quot; for around $1000?

Check is in the mail! Can you have it delivered by next Friday? ;-)

Seriously, I would love to get &quot;an enhanced motor&quot;, but I don't think that
my circumstances allow for it. Mary is my everyday ride, she has a loud 
knock,
low oil pressure and a stripped spark plug! 

I can get a long block off the self, and have her up and running in a 
weekend.

I know it will cost me more in the long term, but for the moment it will 
have to
do!

I called AVP here in Sac but they said that they were too busy doing Type 
IV engines
to do a upright! 

I also looked at getting a new Mexican motor, but I would then have to 
convert to a
DP etc.
