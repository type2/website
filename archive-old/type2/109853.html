&gt;&gt;You either did or didn't have all the shift rods in &gt;neutral.

&gt;They were all at the same depth into the trans. The hockey stick could slide
into any of them.

I came across this info recently while researching nose cone part numbers:

http://type2_dot_com/rvanness/transmis.htm

Here's something you'll need to check before finishing the nose cone job:
While the nose cone is off it's easy to accidentally depress one of the
selectors exposed on the transmission or leave them in an odd position
relative to each other if you just happen to be playing with them for the heck
of it. If you do this, you might end up discovering after installing the
transmission in your bus that the selector hangs up and you can't engage any
gear (pulling the transmission, removing the nose cone and repositioning the
selectors is the only way to remedy this). To avoid this dilemma, make sure
all the selectors are pulled out so that the slots line up, then install the
lever that holds the plastic ball joint and the metal rod that loosely holds
it in place like a hinge. With the selector lever in the nose cone and just
peaking out of the front bushing, slide the small end of the lever into the
ball joint and push the nose cone in place. Tighten the cover down and make
sure you can push/pull the stub of the selector lever that protrudes from the
nose cone--if you can't, one of the selectors is hung up so take the nose cone
off and try again until you get it right. The critical thing here is to get
the selector slots to line up. You don't want to install the transmission and
discover this problem later like someone I know. [innocent whistle]
