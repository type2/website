Subject: Re: [T2] Scamp Trailer Behind 78 Bay

I've been towing a scamp with a '76 westy for 5 years.  It's been to 
Cali from Kansas and over the continental divide half a dozen times.

Our Scamp is a 13&quot; but loaded I'll bet it weighs close to 2,000 lbs. 
I have installed AC, 6 gal. water heater, 12V water pump, furnace and 
6&quot;6&quot; tall shower.  We also hang a large firepit off the rear bumper.

If you want to save weight, money and time, I would suggest buying a 
nice shower tent and a Zodi water heater/shower.

&gt;
&gt;I found the Scamp line to be right up my alley.....
&gt;
&gt;So here's the questions:
&gt;
&gt;     Has anyone had any experience towing a Scamp behind a bus?
&gt;
&gt;Dave.
