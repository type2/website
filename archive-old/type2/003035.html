Returning through France to England I became aware of a background roar
linked to engine speed.
It is *definitely* not transmission, wheel bearing, exhaust or clutch
related.
I can only describe it (here comes the challenge) as a 'whoooooom' building
very quietly in volume to a crescendo and fading as the revs drop and the
gear change takes place.  Sequence repeats through the gears as revs rise
and fall.
Engine runs fine but the noise is fairly loud.  Engine loading makes no odds
and the noise can be heard when the vehicle is stationary.
I believe it is fan related, but can find no gaps in the cowling or any
thing that is missing.  Sounds quite sporty in a narrow street but it wasn't
there before and there have been no impacts or underbody events I can link
it to.
Any ideas would be welcome.
                                    Regards, Bobby.
