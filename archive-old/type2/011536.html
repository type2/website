Mark,
  I will try and keep this short. You went above and beyond
and it would seem you are the last decent person she spent
time with. I hope you can take some solice in that. At the
same time she was one of the last thoughts I had wwhen I
went to bed and one of the first when I woke up this
morning. Is it because I have a 17 year old daughter? I
dont know... all I can think of is &quot;we&quot; have lost one more
free spirit to an increasingly hostile world... that alone
should  give us all pause. While many of us who are in the
bus community try to preserve the sense of community and
basic human kindness it seems we also have to be aware that
not everyone thinks along these lines. I have been &quot;meaning
to&quot; list myself on the AIRS list and have procrastinated..
yesterday I joined so that I can quit being a passive
supporter and become, like you, an active member of the
community. You have my respect and regard for being an
above average person. I hope that you and yours always
recieve as well as you have given!

                   Peace, Dan
