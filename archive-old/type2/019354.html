I did this on my 71 maybe a year ago... its more work than you think...but nothing too
horrible.
Get new brake pads while you're at it.  You'll also need a caliper rebuild kit which
is about $20/side.  It includes a new dust seal, 2 o-rings to fit between the caliper
halves (don't split them unless they are leaking or you absolutely have to) and a
large o-ring that fits inside the caliper and rides along the piston.  I screwed a
grease zerk into the caliper (where the brake line would hook up) and then used a hand
pump grease gun to force out the pistons.  Be sure to put a rage or pad of paper
between the pistons...and DO NOT HAVE YOU&quot;RE FINGERS IN BETWEEN THE PISTONS when you
do this.  They fly out with exreme force!
after that, clean up any rust on them, and use some very very fine sandpaper on the
pisonts and maybe a fine hone on the bores of the calipers to get any gunk off.
Replace the o-ring inside the cylinder, and put the pistons in (you may need to use a
clamp to press them in as they have to be perfectly straight to go in) and then go and
get the dust boots pressed on. Believe me..just have someone press them on.... MUCH
easier.  Don't forget to clean out ALL of the grease out of the inside of the caliper
if you use grease to force out thepistons.  Use brake parts cleaner.
After all that is said and done, replace the brake lines (and probably the hoses in
your case...because I'd bet they are swelled up and thats why you're caliper isn't
releasing) that go between the hose and the caliper...and if you replace the
hose...just replace the brake lines that go all the way to the master cylinder.  Cheap
insurance.
Then, bleed them.  Disk brakes are self adjusting...so....

I hope this helps you out.  It took me a week or so to do it because i had to order
the parts.  Local parts stores should be able to get in the rebuild kits and the brake
pads.

Any more questions?
