Subject: 2-bbl Webber Progressive - Calibration?

Hey guys,

        Another question. I remember back when I had an 82 TransAm, that
there was a special way for me to adjust the fuel / air screws (not the
idle screw) on my 4-bbl Rochester QuadraJET. Well, on my VW Bus, I have a
2-bbl Webber Progressive. I'd like to make sure that it's configured
properly so that, I'm neither running lean, or running rich. Without
buying some fancy tools (unless that's my only alternative). Is there a
good method to tune and adjust the fuel / air screws on my carburetor to
make sure I'm getting just the right fuel mixture? 

It runs pretty decent, but it pops sometimes. It used to desiel on
occasion, but now that I've driven it more, it no longer does that.

Thanks,

Todd
