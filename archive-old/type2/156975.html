&gt; and I can't back off the shoe adjustment- any other trick here?

Is the drum solidly frozen to the hub, or is there some movement?  If it
is solidly frozen, apply penetrating oil and continue wiggling/tapping the
drum.  It will eventually come loose.  If you are lucky, the shoes are
worn enough that the drum will come off.  If not, you are left with the
delemma of destroying parts by yanking the drum off with a puller or
somehow backing the adjusting stars off.

When you are done, you will be a believer in lubing the adjusters and
stars well with anti-sieze!
