Subject: wanted: gas BA6 heater

Greetings from chilly Oregon,

After having sustained enough pain during my early morning commute in my 82
Westy, I have decided to do something about it. After searching through every
VW archive I could find, and speaking to several listmembers, I have decided
to attempt a plunge into the realm of GAS HEATERS.

I am looking desperately for an Eberspacher BA-6 to install in my Westy. I
would truly appreciate it if any listmembers have a lead on one. It goes
without saying that I would prefer a heater that has all its ancillary parts
(all relays, timer, aux-blower fan, and necessary ducting). I am eagerly
anticipating this upcoming project.

Thank you all for any insights you may give,
Tom VandenBerg
