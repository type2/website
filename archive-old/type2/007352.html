Subject: Comment about Westie water pumps
Date: Sat, 17 Oct 1998 01:34:32 -0500

the DPO had installed an Atwood mini bilge pump in the Westy water tank.
Water pressure from the sink was barely adequate. I ordered the J.C. Whipme
submersible pump and just installed it. WOW! big difference in water
pressure! The sink really spits out the water now with good pressure and
flow. It was well worth the cost and works just fine. I hope it lasts
though... the pump looks so cheap. 

I also ordered one of their replacement windshield washer pumps and it is
working nicely too. I see some of the suppliers offering &quot;genuine German&quot;
pumps at a greater cost...but my philosophy is that, if the German pumps
were superior, then why am I having to replace them now? My vehicle is a
1982. I have owned other older vehicles and never had a problem with
windshield washer pumps. Seems like the &quot;Genuine&quot; parts might be inferior
in design.
