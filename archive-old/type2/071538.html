If your original plugs really are gapped at 6.5, and there's no other visible 
problem, like a crack in the ceramics, or a jimmied thread, then they really 
aren't worn out. You can use them until they do wear out. The shop that sold 
you an odd set of plugs made a mistake. take the plugs back. The plugs you 
need depend on the heads you have. if your heads are stock, then the correct 
plugs for your model year or engine number are the ones you need, if your 
heads ain't stock, then you have to find out what ones to get. But here's a 
clue -- the old plugs were working fine, presumably, so put 'em back in. see 
the 25th Anniversary Idiots Guide for a list of ehgine numbers.  

Plugs are worn when the electrodes have lost metal and no longer appear 
square when you view them cross section. The main symptom for worn plugs is 
poor cold starting.
