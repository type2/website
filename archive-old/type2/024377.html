Message-ID: &lt;7upbfd$4njj_at_eGroups_dot_com&gt;

Hi Volks,

&gt; While we are on the subject of dwell and EI, I have a Pertronix
equivelant
&gt; that I purchased at the FLAPS.  Cant remember the brand off the top
of my
&gt; head. Anyway, i was wondering if the dwell reading is relevant any
more.

 If your system is stock in other respects, then yes: Dwell is still
relevant.

&gt; When I hook up the meter i get a 60 as opposed to the 50 w/points. I
asked
&gt; the sales person about this and he just said &quot;it is made for all point
&gt; distributors.&quot;  That's all he said, sounded kinda fishy to me.

 I think he's right: It was &quot;made for all&quot;, but I suspect it may have
been
made badly.
 I have read that the Hall effect units can be adjusted to effect
changes
in dwell in the same manner that points can: changing the gap between
&quot;sender&quot; and plate supposedly affects the amount of rotation during
which
the magnetic field is strong enough to switch the sender, hence altering
the dwell. Try increasing the gap, if you can.

 Another possibility would be to get a CD module. Since this fires the 
coil at full blast every time there isn't any need for the points to
manage the charge/discharge cycle of the coil and so they do make the
dwell irrelevant.

Cheers,
	W.
