&gt; Hello folks,
&gt;
&gt; I'm selling my 81 Westfalia in order to upgrade to some sort of camper
that has seat belts in the back seat - we're having a baby and my wife
and I wouldn't trust a JC Whitney seat belt installation with our baby's
chair.  Details of the rig can be found at
http://www.geocities_dot_com/cdarilek2000/VanagonWestfalia1981.htm

An '81 westy doesn't have belts in the back seat?  Did they designate it
&quot;stationary use only&quot;?
