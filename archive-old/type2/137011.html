&gt;I am having problems reading some of the handwritten dimensions. I was
&gt;wondering if anyone has made one of these recently and knows the dimensions.
&gt;What I need is
&gt;  1.. The overall length of Piece A - the right side of the piece as shown in
&gt;the drawing (looks like either 3 7/8 or 3 7/16).
&gt;  2.. The overall length of Piece B (although this might not be as critical as
&gt;piece A).
&gt;  3.. The height of Piece A (looks like 1 1/4 or 1 1/2)
&gt;  4.. The height of the upper holes in Piece A ( 3/4 ? )
&gt;I can wait until I have the engine apart and figure it out but I would like to
&gt;fabricate it in advance if possible.
&gt;  
&gt;
You're pretty much going to have to wait until things are apart anyway. 
I built one from that drawing -- forget how I finally made a 
determination about what the chicken scratches were meant to say, but 
even so, when it is time to mount it to the oil cooler you'll need to 
make some adjustments of hole locations from where they are drawn to be, 
and I believe that I had to trim the corner a bit to get the doghouse to 
settle down over it.
