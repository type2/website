Subject: RE: Valve Adjustment Nuts.

&gt;===== Original Message From visket_at_umem_dot_com =====
&gt;Greetings, and Happy Y2K.
&gt;
&gt;While adjusting the valves on my 1915DP, I noticed that a couple of nuts
&gt;weren't rotating on the screws very cleanly, making that final torque take
&gt;the screw with it, tightening the adjustment without my consent.
&gt;
&gt;I went to the specialty bins at the hardware store, and found some nuts
&gt;hardened to &quot;8.8&quot; something-or-the-other. These nuts are also thicker than
&gt;the ones that were on my motor, making for a better grip with the 13mm
&gt;tools. They rotated very cleanly on the adjustment screws, and made the
&gt;final tightening process foolproof. I figure they also have more thread area
&gt;to clench the screw with - that being a good thing.
&gt;
&gt;Q1 - Is that a good thing?
&gt;Q2 - Do the standard nuts have a tendency to strip internally?
&gt;Q3 - Are the nuts I bought (.45 cents each!) going to get me home tonight?
&gt;I've taken it 30 miles without anything starting to rattle. What does the
&gt;&quot;grade 8.8&quot; mean?
&gt;Q4 - Will the bit of extra weight (thicker nuts) cause any problems that we
&gt;can think of?
&gt;
&gt;I actually like the look of these new nuts to the point where I'm thinking
&gt;of getting a complete set for my next adjustment.
&gt;
&gt;Thanks -
&gt;


I cannot answer any of the questions but #3.  I used to work in for a nut and 
bolt wholesaler.  The Grade 8 refers to the way the steel was hardened.  Grade 
8 nuts (ten years ago) were the hardest you could buy.  The harder the steel 
the more force required to &quot;break the head off the nut&quot; as one of the old 
timers explained it to me.  My guess is that it will also take the heat better 
than Grade 5 (the other alternative).

If someone knows more (or better) than this, I will stand corrected....8-)
