Oh Oh, big brother is watching!  :)

&gt; I need to take my 72 Westy to the local VW shop, that will normally not be a
&gt; problem, but since I'm currently in Iraq and my wife will not drive it, means
&gt; that I need to have it towed. I remember reading somewhere that buses
&gt; shouldn't or couldn't be towed the way &quot;regular&quot; cars are. Is that true? Or
&gt; it really doesn't matter?

For a short-range low-speed trip with an undamaged transmission there
should be no problem.  Use a wheel-lift towtruck and make sure that the
transmission is in neutral.

If I were towing for a long ways at highway speeds, I would disconnect
the axles.

Isn't there anyone in the area who can give this fellow a hand and just
drive the bus to the shop?  Heck, if your wife simply drives to the shop
and picks up the mechanic he might be happy to drive the bus back.

Play the &quot;Overseas GI in need&quot; card.  You deserve certainly deserve it!
