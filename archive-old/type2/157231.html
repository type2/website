Subject: Re: [T2] Scratching sound on acceleration

John, look for something that is loose and moving to
contact a rotating part of the engine on accel. Also
look for loose bolts at starter and all of the clutch
housing bolts. Look for something in the well where
the crankshaft pulley is. Grab the alternator belt and
pull it hard to see if alternator is anchored
properly. Finally, look for something in the airflow
of the heater / defroster like a piece of paper that
is rattling at a certain frequency - of course if you
have had the heat totally off, that is eliminated
already. - BaH

&gt; Weird.  Only hear at night when everything is
&gt; louder, or in light 
&gt; traffic. When I just barely touch the accelerator,
&gt; this constant 
&gt; sound like  sandpaper scratching (gets louder the
&gt; more you listen!). 
&gt; I thought it must be the cable, but I tried pressing
&gt; the accelerator 
&gt; while in neutral, and no sound.  Could it be the
&gt; clutch?
&gt; 
&gt; anyone with ideas of what it could be, or how I can
&gt; isolate it to 
&gt; find the cause? And how bad it is?
