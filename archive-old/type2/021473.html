Hi Paul.
On both my vans, the lite goes on when I apply the park brake.  The little lens
should just pop out of the socket at the dash.  Two little tabs keep it in.
Some get glued in as the tabs being so old and dried up tend to break off.
I also use the brake lite as an indicator lite to see if I have rear brake lite
problems.  The rear brake lites and the park brake lite are on the same fuse.
I had problems in the past with the brake lites blowing fuses and when that
happened, the park brake lite stopped also.  I think it's the same bulb as the
dash lites.  I'm sure I'll be corrected if I'm wrong.  Any confirmations?

&gt;  how do I get into that light fixture to replace the bulb?
