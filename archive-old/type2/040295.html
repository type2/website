Subject: Help with my '72 bus

Hi all, , , , , , ,

I have a few problems with my new '72 bus, and I thought you volks might be
able to help me out here. . .

1. It ran very hot &amp; thanx to your inputs, here on the list, I installed the
air seal between the engine and the body. That helped consisderably,
however, it STILL runs hot, but not as hot as before. What am I missing here?

2. The brakes went squirley when I stepped on the brakes the other day
REALLY squirley, swerving left &amp; right! What's up with that?

3. I have a very loud clanking sound coming from the rear of the bus when it
even crosses a small crack in the road. I can't identify it, but it sounds it's very
loud, and sounds VERY expensive. Any hints on what to look for?

I'm really looking forward to getting this puppy on the road, but I sure don't
want to get stranded in the middle of the boonies somewhere,
( And I LIVE it the boonies!)
The engine sounds very strong, other than a flat spot when you step on the gas
from a stop sign. I can finesse that, however.

Thanx for your inputs, ,

Ron C.
