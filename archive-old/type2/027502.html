I have a question on my windshield wipers.  I looked in the archives but 
found no in detail description of the whole setup.

My windshield wipers work fine except for the awful knocking noise when they 
hit the up position(then they go back down, then up, KNOCK).  It is not 
constant and does not happen everytime it goes into the up position..  
Sometimes I when I shut them off it makes the knock about 2 seconds after I 
have already shut them off.

This weekend I pulled the wipers so they were off the windshield and turned 
them on and no noise.

I looked underneath the dash and couldn’t see anything obvious.  I didn’t 
see the contraption hitting anything as the revolutions went around.

One thing to note though, the PO put a dent in the front of the van right 
where the shaft on the left windshield wiper is.  Its about a 3x3 inch 
circle dent.

Any ideas??  Does this sound like my motor or something else?

Does anyone have a diagram of the whole contraption??
