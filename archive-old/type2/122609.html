&gt; I'm not looking forward to lying on my back and working over my head for
&gt; hours, but I have little choice.  In addition, I'm terrified of doing
&gt; something that will kill my engine and leave me with no transportation while
&gt; I get my engine rebuilt.  Hopefully the power of the Mighty List can help me
&gt; through this challenge.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks in advance for any help or suggestions.

 

jason,

we sell a repair kit for fixing stripped head stud holes:

http://www.germansupply_dot_com/xcart/customer/product.php?productid=16350&amp;cat=&amp;
page=1

this is a delicate job, even with the head on a workbench. so under the bus,
you are in a bad way, but it is possible to do a good job if you take your
time. there are two issues to be careful about - depth of drilled hole and
alignment of hole. if the studs have pulled clean out, the holes will be
fairly easy to center in the correct location, but you still need to be
careful to keep the tools perfectly true to the axis of the hole. as for
depth, you must mark the drill with tape, or use a stop, so it does not go
too deep. a too deep hole will result in a hole right into the combustion
chamber, obviously not good. make sure to use cutting fluid during the
drilling and tapping (what fun, it will drip in your eyes as you drill
away!)

i am working on a tech article for using the time-sert kit, but until it is
done and posted on our site, time fastener have pretty good instructions
with the kit. they are also good about answering questions on the phone.

there are some good articles in the library on doing these repairs. they do
not relate directly to the time-sert kits, but the prinicples are similar.

i have personally used different kinds of thread repair methods and
time-serts are far and away the best i have used. the best thing about them
is they do not come out ever, if properly installed. the insertion tools are
very well designed as well.

once the inserts are in, make sure the sealing surface on the exhaust port
is very clean and straight. i use a small, very fine grit abrasive wheel on
a dremmel tool to lightly resurface the notch in the port where the copper
gasket sits. going around in a circular motion, you can delicately &quot;mill&quot; a
new flat surface on this arear. also, make sure to heat the new gaskets red
hot before installing (then let cool) so they will annealm which helps
sealing. we recommend loctite 518 on the gasket surfaces, sparingly applied.

and use only VW head studs.

if you do all these steps, the exhaust leaks should disappear for good.
