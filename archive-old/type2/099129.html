Subject: Re: [T2] timing and pinging question

Paul

maybe you should read http://www.type2_dot_com/library/electrip/050rev.htm
That page tells you a few things you should know,
 this is not a stock distributor for any VW. Most Bosch books don't even list
it.
This is strictly a mechanical advance distributor.

points should be set at 50 deg on the dwell meter,, not 24,, 
and as you have a dwell meter,, don't bother confoosing yourself with a feeler
gauge setting,

set the valves, 
adjust the dwell to 50 deg, 
set the timing to 7.5 
adjust the carb to 900 rpm,,

take it for a drive,, and then adjust the timing to 5 deg 

swing the timing adv and retarded for a few degrees and see what happens

The books say numbers for NEW engine, NEW dist., etc.   
You have to play around a bit to find the timing that your engine will run nice
at.

&gt; everything. 050 distib, breaker type points, oil
&gt; bath air cleaner, you name it all original to this
&gt;  motor. My question and problem is. Timing set
&gt; to 7 ATDC points at .016 dwell at 24 on the 4
&gt; cyl scale and idle set at 950. Timed with
&gt; vacuum hook up all like the old volks page
&gt; said to do.
