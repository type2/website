Off topic - Vanagon_at_gerry.vanagon_dot_com list is down.

I received this from the vanagon list admin this morning.  If you are also on
the vanagon list and not on the 'spare' list, you might want to subscribe to
keep the mail coming.

'Spare' Vanagon


[...]
Tom Carrington broadcast into the ether:
&gt; 
&gt; The router that connects Gerry (the Vanagon list server) to the rest of the
&gt; world died last night. I opened a service call with my ISP for a
&gt; replacement. I expect it to take about a week or so to get me back online.
&gt; 
&gt; So, it's time to use the &quot;spare&quot; Vanagon list!
&gt; 
&gt; If you are new to the list and haven't been through the drill, it's pretty
&gt; easy. Just head over to 
&gt; 
&gt; http://www.egroups_dot_com/group/vanagon
&gt; 
&gt; and sign up for the list. Once Gerry is on speaking terms with the rest of
&gt; the world again, I'll post a message to the spare list.
&gt; 
&gt; You will probably hear from Jim, who created and manages the &quot;spare&quot; list.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks!
&gt; 
&gt; Your vanagon list admin,
