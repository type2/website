&amp;gt; I am cleaning some final parts before engine assembly. I turned my

&amp;gt; it but I cannot really determine if it is unplugged or not. Should I be
&amp;gt; able to put a piece of wire in one end and take it out the other?

You should be able to blow easily through the heat riser.

If you can, this would be a good time for the &amp;quot;speedo cable in the drill&amp;quot;
cleaning trick.  This doesn't work so well on a completely blocked riser,
but it is a good way to clean out a tube that is just a bit dirty with
carbon deposits.
