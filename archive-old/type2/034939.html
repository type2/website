Subject: When will this madness end?

Isaiah, reporting in with his daily problem.

well...after the DBG meeting I got a few ideas on why my motor won't run
worth a hoot and idles super low and choppy.  Thick oil....I
said..ok..fair enough. So I changed it today in the snow and slush to a
much thinner, more appropriate, oil.  Helped with the cranking a little
bit...but not much.
It was warmer today so it did start....and then quit.
the motor runs really choppy and will quit under its own power...or lack
thereof.  it idles super low and its just no fun.

my list of things I've done.

checked out the choke...its OK
fuel is fine
pump is pumping
filter is good
gas is getting to the carb
new plug wires - that are on the correct cylinders
new cap
recent condenser and properly gapped points
timing is on
carb recently rebuilt
no vacuum leaks
etc etc...

any rhyme or reason to why this is happening????
Its got me stumped along with a few others.  Others have had this
problem and I've tried things they've said to do...but no help.
what gives?

motor is a 1600 SP located in the heart of WI.  where its cold.
the motor is really hard to start too.  it will kind of sputter like it
wants to start...then get off to a really slow start and eventually fire
under its own power.  sometimes.  sometimes it won't even start at all.
this is really disturbing me.

later all.
