&gt; I'm sure someone out there has run into this problem. My 81 Vanagon has a
&gt; very loud and distintive, classic bedspring squeak. It originates from the

&gt; even if I sit or stand in the front seat and bounce.

My bus just started to do the same thing and I thought it was just the cold
weather but maybe not.
