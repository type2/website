&gt; plus with out the fresh air ducts, I bet it runs nice an cool in that
&gt; engine compartment :)

Not to mention the funky air cleaner and lack of any sort of breather tube
on the oil filler.  It must blow oil all over the engine bay.

To be fair, it looks like most of the engine tin is in place, including
the covers over the heat riser.  It might be that this engine hasn't been
too badly &quot;improved&quot;.
