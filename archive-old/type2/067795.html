Subject: Fishing boat Fluff &amp; Trailers

 I keep meaning to mention this little toy and since it's getting
on to Xmas (anyone remember how to spell that the real way?)

 I stopped at the local Burger King last summer and when I came out
there was a motorcycle parked next to me with a 2 wheel trailer.

 It looked kind of cool and had a spacious closed compartment.
 
 I took a better look. What's wrong with this picture?

 Aluminum box looking thing hinged on one end, &quot;clam-shell&quot; style.

 This was not a simple box but a fold up aluminum flat-bottom skiff!

 Unfolded it would have been a 4' wide by 10' long fishing boat.

 Made by an outfit in Eugene, Ore. as I recall and just clever as hell.

 In the &quot;Cool Trailer&quot; dept:

 One was a Split cut right behind the doors and closed off, being
towed by a close or identical year Split.

 I thought I was having one of those flash-backs.

 It was totally professional and beautiful setup.

 The second real kool was a Karmen Ghia with the same kind of setup.

 The guy had taken the ass off another or two KGs and put them together end
to end. The double engine hatches for access.

 All this was towed by an identical real life KG.

 I was onto this, this time so I didn't panic.
