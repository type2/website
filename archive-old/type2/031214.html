&gt; people out in those parts, and I refuse to own a cell phone, so I took to my

&gt; and drove me back to his house to let me use the phone, even though it made
&gt; him late for services. I'm sure the lord understood.

if not a cell phone how about AAA???

they paid for themselves Friday when I had wheelbearing shatter on I-95
within the hour a roll back arrived and hauled me 70 miles to my garage,
no charge, no hassle

&gt; through it in a VW. That's why AIRS is such a beautiful thing.

yup, the list in the glove box is the security blanket that makes driving
