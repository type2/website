&gt; At the end of my drive home from work yesterday I came to a stop to 
&gt; find the garage door opener.  When I started up the driveway I heard 4 
&gt; or 5 clicks and then a squealing.  I got out and looked around a 
&gt; little bit and nothing looks abnormal at quick glance.  I got back in 
&gt; and it squealed half weay up the driveway and stopped.  Does this 
&gt; sound like brakes or a wheel bearing or something?  Any other ideas?

I didn't take the wheels off, but the disks look OK.  Nothing fresh 
looking, but I wasn't able to get my finger in there to feel for high 
edges and such.  It's not making any strange noise in either firward or 
reverse at the moment, but I plan on a more extensive drive after I've 
had a change to take the wheels off and have a look.  If the caliper 
froze would it unfgreeze sitting overnight?
