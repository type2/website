Subject: Just for laughs: Firewall removal and putting back on (Semi

To the guys and gals  who are replacing their fuel lines I would like to talk
about about removing the firewall for my 75.  I first removed the bolts and
and the two underneath the bus.  No problem.  Then I removed all
aircleaniing equipment and the metal line from the cold start valve area.  I
pushed up, pushed down, putty knives and screwdrivers everywhere. 
No luck.  Had my dad try, we exchanged choice words we each other
and then the bus and quit for the day.  We both realized that it didn't want
to clear the engine mounting apparatus so fthe next dayy we said
decided two hands are better then one and with alot of might we
yanked(leveraged with some screwdrivers) that sucker right out.  No
damage no worries. Replaced the vent lines and did not replace the
57mm filler tube because it was in grand shape.  Putting the wall back on
was crazy.  Just couldn't figure out how to make it work but that wall is
awfully bendable.  So after bending and poking, my firewall is in place
very snug.  It is bent to hell and has some duct tape covering a couple
small spots but no more gas leak and it runs just fine.  So if someone has
a better explanation let those of us out here know. My efforts were far
from pretty but I feel I have helped protect those that I love (passengers
and bus) from a firey experience.  So if your stuck and everything is out
of the way get a friend and leverage the f*** out of that wall  with some
screw drivers, putty knives whatever and replace those lines and check
the tank. Good luck and yes I know if I drop the engine about 12 inches
everything comes off  just dandy but I ain't that talented yet. Far from it
but willing to learn and become mechanically inclined.
