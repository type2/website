Subject: &lt;F&gt;Baywindow Bus Sells for $21,900.00
X-Diagnostic: MESSAGE MAY NOT BE TOPICAL - S

Hey there Volks,

Since it's friday I thought that I'd pass along a something I saw on
that auction site (not vintagebus_dot_com auction, the other one).

If you'd like to see for yourself, goto :

http://cgi.ebay_dot_com/aw-cgi/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&amp;item=584484313

Yep, 21 thousand for a Beach Bomb matchbox car. One of the rarest
matchbox cars, but still a matchbox. And you thought your full sized
bus was expensive 8-)

To see some slightly more affordable baywindow bus toys, I've got a
few of them posted on my webpage:

Enjoy,
