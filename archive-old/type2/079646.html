&gt; It looks like someone removed the EGR filter.  The feed tube

&gt; air distributer (using terms from my Bentley...)  I assume that
&gt; this is a bad thing?  How would the engine perform in this situation?

It is not good, but it is hardly uncommon.  The engine runs fine, without
it, but a bit hotter and a bit less efficiently.  As Barry wrote earlier
today, the valves are often in bad shape at this age, even if they are
present.

&gt; My EGR valve (according to Bentley) is &quot;mechanical&quot;, is that the little
&gt; thingy with the lever that the feed tube bolts into by the intake?

yes

&gt; Or is the filter/valve one and the same?

no, the filter lives under the tin near the muffler.

I am on my way out to my '73 to have another go at installing the new
front axle beam, I will try to get pics of the whole EGR system while I am
there and will post them later today.

&gt; Oh, last question, what is that silver/grey thing mounted by the fuel
&gt; tank panel (to the right, sorta near the ECU)?  It's about the same
&gt; size as my Palm pilot, but thicker and with rounded edges, looks like
&gt; something plugs into it.

That sounds like your voltage regulator.  Three wires to a plug? The VW
was silver can with relays inside, but aftermarket ones are all solid
state these days.

&gt; Sorry for my ignorance, I come from a type I world and am new to type IV
&gt; (and FI in particular)  but I am very determined and capable assuming the
&gt; parts can be found.  The junkyards around here (Wilmington, NC) seem to lack
&gt; later buses, so if anyone has a line on the afore mentioned parts, I would
&gt; be eternally grateful.

Hey! We all started out there!  Parts are, alas, not getting any easier to
find in junkyards, at least here on the east (or is that rust?) coast.
If you can get someone on the west coast or in the SW to lok for you, or
can arrange a &quot;business trip&quot; to LA or San Diego, it would make your life
a lot easier :-)  I am seriously thinking it is time to do just that,
travelling up and down the coast stopping at a variety of junk yards and
picking up bits. I miss West coast junkyards second most of all the things
in California.
