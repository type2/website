Subject: engine price

thanks for the input, it is a bus engine, i don't know if everything is
there or not for FI, but i had planed to use a set of carbs i have from
a 1.8 that has a non rebuildable block (cracked and the like, holes
etc.) this 2.0L would be going into a 75' camper. maybe i will shop
around alot more. if i get an engine that turns over shouldn't i
disasemble it and put all new seals and bushings/bearings?

thanks

wade
