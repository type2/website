Subject: Re: [T2] Crankcase ventilation

Ok, this is starting to test my patience.  I ran the bus at idle (well, at 
low rpm, it doesn't hold idle) for ~5 minutes.  The compression was

#1 120
#2 130

I then drove the bus around the block, getting the engine up to full 
operating temp.  The bus ran pretty well, it felt good once the revs got 
above ~1500, with normal power.  It doesn't really idle, it stalled at 
every corner.  Once back in the garage,  I redid the compression test

#1 115
#2 120
#3  0 (actually ~10)
#4 115

After my initial shock, I tested #3 again.  Again, it was (near) 0.  To add 
insult to injury now I can't get the spark plug back in the cylinder.  How 
could I have cross threaded it with the compression tester?!?  I'll try 
again in the morning when I'm less agitated.  I think I'll go for a nice 
long run along the lake (and maybe jump in).

&gt;Although this signals an engine that is a bit too out-of-balance, it 
&gt;doesn't sound low enough to cause your crankcase pressure. I would test 
&gt;again, with the warmest engine you can.
