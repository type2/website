Subject: Re: Powder Coating my Rims

Dave asked:

	To anyone who has done this before, do I need to have any parts of the rim
	masked off before coating, or do you just coat the whole thing inside and
	out?

My reply:

I only had the tires taken off. Handed the rims in rusty and dirty as hell
(they said not to bother doing anything about them). Got them back better
than new ......

I had them coated silvery grey with clear coat on top. Looks great.
