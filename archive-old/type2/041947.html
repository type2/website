Subject: AType2 Acc./History Question

Okay all you keepers of arcane Type2 knowledge. Here's one for 'ya: Why is it 
that the engineers of our little beasties saw fit to install a completly 
functional ashtry, and a 12v. acc. socket, yet no FREAKING cig. lighter. I'm 
on my fourth and last Westy (' 78, and this one they're gonna have to burry 
me in before I sell her) and not one of them had a flipping lighter. (Not 
that its a difficult install, takes all of 15 min.) The Vanagons got factory 
lighters, but not us. What gives?
