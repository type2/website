All knowing source of vw knowledge:

I've finally gotten around to doing a closer inspection of my '71 transporter and, now that it's summer, try to figure out 
where the exhaust smell in the heat is coming from. I've found the the muffler is not the original type as shown in Bentley 
or RMMW catalog for this year and model.

My engine is stamped with # B6298523 but my vin is 221 204 1800. According to Muir, 1993, that engine number is from a 1970 
bug. Do you all read it that way? It says the last B series ended in 1970 in type 2s with # B 5 230 000. My bus year is 
supposed to have and AE starting number. Muir doesn't give all the vin numbers though. He runs through the 21x xxxx xxx 
series but not the 221s. Maybe they had different numbers? 

Anyway,they're all the same size engines and all take the same muffler for the busses but the bugs take a different muffler. 
So when the PO put this one into the bus, he had to jam the paper/foil air tube around the preheater pipe tube, which led to 
a corrosion of this tube and a hole as well as a hole in the air tube to the heater. Hence, exhaust flowing directly into 
the bus heat system, no wonder it smelled so bad! I'm glad I didn't run it much last winter!

The muffler that's there now looks like it's from a 40hp/1200cc typeI. It has no &quot;fresh air heater&quot; contraption (that 
bulbous appendage attached to both sides of the muffler) and the foil air tubes hook directly into the heat exchanger.

Can someone tell me how this &quot;fresh air heater&quot; works as opposed to the &quot;stale air heater&quot; or the one like I have that has 
neither air heater?

It looks, in the RMMW catalog, like the same heat exchanger is used on both vehicles so if I have to buy a new muffler, 
hopefully the correct muffler will hook right up to the heat exchanger and to the manifold preheater pipe tube, etc. What do 
you think?

I hope the tin is all the same and that the po didn't give me tin from the bug. I doubt it.

Thanks in advance for your specific answers to some of these questions. It'll be a big help!
