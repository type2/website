Doubtful...Most of the car search services are computer-based. A real search
would entail contacting the MV in the car's particular state, and working back
from there thru' each owner. Might not even reveal much beyond names...The
VW's were cheap enough back then so it'd be doubtful that a wreck or salvage
title would've been worth the effort to rebuild and sell at a profit; which 
is the
usual point of &quot;modern&quot; searches.
