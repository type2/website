Thanks to you all for your tips and anecdotes.  They made interesting and
valuable reading.  My son and I have gone through them and are looking
forward to the weekend when we will have time to do some driving.

I am certain that he will learn to drive his bus well.  I hope that he will
also learn something about what makes a car work, and what you can do when
it doesn't.  I am happy to be embarking on this adventure with him.

If anyone else has something to offer please send it directly to me and we
can lay this thread to rest.


Thanks again all.

Lloyd
