Subject: Re: '77 Heat?

I used to have this problem, absolutely froze my nuts off the first
winter I had my van.

The total heat output will never be magnificent but here's what I've
done to make it a lot better.

When I took the belly pan off I found I had the tube that feeds the 
little heater at the rear of the walk through missing (VW make this out
of cardboard). I replaced it with 60mm flexible alluminium tubing.
Lots more heat.

In general:-
  Have a look at the tubes forward of the heat exchangers to look for  
  leaks. Use duct tape for a quick fix.
  The long straight section of the pipe can be replaced with plastic 
  guttering down pipe.
  Use a wire coat hanger hook to fish out any rubbish that has got into 
  the tubing.
  Insulate the pipe where ever possible - I used closed cell foam held 
  in place with duct tape.

This work comes with a $$$ warning. 
When you get a good volume of warm air up the front you may then detect
that its contaminated by exhaust fumes which you have not been able to
detect in the trickle of air you get now. Buy a CO detector FIRST 
(cheep) - see posts from a few weeks ago - now on sell in UK in hardware 
stores. And be prepared for possible heat exchanger replacement ($lots).


I also found that the heater grill at the rear of the walk through seemed
to take more than its fair share of heat so I've blocked that pipe off 
and got a substantial increase in hot air to the front.

You could also try to ensure that cold air is not getting in - look at
window seals, door seals and that draft up your trouser leg because the 
seal is missing around the brake and/or clutch pedal.
