&gt; one of the first things checked.
&gt; 
&gt;&gt;  Is your cold-start injector leaking by chance?
&gt; 
&gt; why would a backfire damage that??  but I did check it and it appears to
&gt; be fine.. it starts fine, and after the engine gets up to maybe 185

I'm thinking more along weird running engine - excess gas in manifold...


&gt;&gt; manifold  vacuum good?
&gt; 
&gt; next on my list.  it's hard to check when you can't keep it running
&gt; without holding the throttel part way open...

Yeah.. that'd be tricky..

Ok, the obvious:

-timing ok? (as far as you can tell)
-getting spark to all cylinders?
-are all cylinders firing
-spark plugs good
-temp sensor I and II good
-checked all the resistance values for your AFM
-the connections to all the plugs for EFI clean (progold is good for that)
-cables attached correctly
-points make any difference?
-fuel pressure good?

do you have an assistant/remote starter handy to at least keep it
running while you pull injector cables to see any change in rpm.
