Subject: J. Jam AZ !!!! VW Literature hoard

I will be joining a small CA caravan to AZ.

I will bring TONS of VW LITERATURE, never before seen by the general
public.  It get a little boring camping out on the 5 acres of dirt for 3
days.

I will bring enough to keep you-all occupied for hours.

I have Dealership brochures, NOS OWNERS MANUALS , I have been collecting
these for years,  I think I have everything from 1955-1979 NOS!

Lots of other nifty VW novelty items.

NO ATMS for miles.   Come by and introduce yourself.

I will be in a bright RED '71 panel bus with huge HOTWHEELS sticker on it.
(on vendor row)

Anyone wanna plan a pot luck dinner?

I will bring CA oak firewood for a campfire.
