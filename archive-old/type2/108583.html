Subject: friday Question

I was wondering what people thought. In your &quot;humble&quot; opinion, is it better to
have things break all at once and be out of commission for a good while, or
have a long string of minor inconveniences that still keep you off the road
and tie up your evenings. I have the latter, and don't want the former, but I
was wondering what the consensus is.

Have a good weekend

Zach
