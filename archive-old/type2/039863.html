&gt; My 72 HighTopper has the built in LP gas tanks, but I have never used this

you can have the tanks checked professionally if you don't feel
comfortable doing it yourself, I am sure a camping trailer or motorhome
service facility would be able to do it or direct you to someone.

if you do it yourself I would start with an inert gas.   Charge the system
with CO2 or Helium or Nitrogen to check it out.   put a presure gauge on
it if it doesn't have one and let it sit for a week and monitor the
presure, it should not fall by more than a lb a day MAX.  then check all
the lines and the appliances.  after your sure everything works
mechanically and is sound I would put a &quot;minimal&quot; charge in the tank and
OUTSIDE with all the windows and doors open go through a test of each
appliance, wear a face mask and cotten clothes, including long sleeves
when doing this..  soapy water is the best leak detector. DON'T use an
open flame.!  Keep a BC rated fire ext handy.
