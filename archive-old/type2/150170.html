Subject: Re: [T2] New concept van in Michelin Challenge with bus feel

Hi Neale,

That's cool!

I can see styling cues borrowed from Studebaker and from the 57  
corvette as well, but the design clearly a descendant of our beloved  
type2's. With the provision for a front-mounted engine it's a lot  
closer to reality than the verdier_dot_ca design.


Happy trails,
