&gt;And Scott, thanks for your comprehensive &quot;hand into the present&quot;.  But I am
&gt;still puzzled at one thing he said.  He was sad about not being able to 
&gt;&quot;chip&quot;
&gt;present day Porsche engines (his words and sentiment, not mine).  Does this
&gt;make sense?


Mike,
any time.
With regards to present day Porsche engines, I'm guessing your guy is a bit 
behind the times.

The Boxter has pretty much a &quot;present day&quot; porsche engine.

I'm guessing that he is referring to the days of past when it was as simple 
as pulling the old chip out and swapping in a new one.  I'm looking at my 
stack of GM chips up on the shelf and GM was real nice, providing a easily 
removable holder for each chip, with the actual swap taking much less time 
than opening up the ECM.

Now its a BIT more complicated but not impossible and in some cases, not 
what you want an average grease monkey messing with.
