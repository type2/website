(regarding possibility of flipping ring gear in Subaru transmission to run

&gt; I finaly got a hold of the guy, He said there is no way to flip the ring
&gt; gear on a Subaru trans. The design of the case is bigger on the side of the
&gt; ring gear to make room, the other side is not. So I guess unless you could
&gt; fit redux boxes to the trailing arms it won't work. However if you could
&gt; somehow have a cam made for the engine so that the engine could be run
&gt; backwards, I know too crazy and too much money.

Well, I guess that settles that!  Apparently this is one part of the VW
design that wasent emulated closely.  Ah well, on to the next dream...
