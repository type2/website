The only place it is shown in the 68-79 Bentley is
in section 3, fuel system. On page 27, section 7.2 barely talks about
it and
figure 7-2 has a drawing about it.
Very poor information.


i agree that is very limited info.  pretty much doesnt help me much at
all.  does anyone have a bone stock dual carbed bus that would like to
take some photos and post them to a page?

possibly we could get some with a 72,73 and 74 showing the changes
made to the dual carb set-up.  they only had it for 3 yrs and there
are not many un-molested vans/engines out there.  i personally could
use a good photo gallery of the above mentioned engine compartments. 
anyone else??

just an idea.
