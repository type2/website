Subject: Re: [T2] Which SVDA Distributor????

Aaron + list,

I've had bad luck with the Bruck SVDA (Bosch knockoff) offered by
cip1. Stick with the genuine Bosch part.

I'm waiting for my holiday bonus so I can purchase the right part.

Some will argue that the aircooled_dot_net SVDA and the one BD sells are
in fact the same, and since aircooled_dot_net won't tell us exactly what
they're doing to the distributors they sell to &quot;tune the vacuum can&quot;
one can only guess. Either choice would be superior in my experience
to the Bruck model.

Don't let the $20-$30 savings on the &quot;Bruck&quot; SVDA get you.

peace
