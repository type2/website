Subject: Travelling to Miami

Hello friends from the list:

I will most probably be travelling to Miami for business on the last
week of January.  I wonder if any of you know if in those days will
there be some kind of VW event in the Miami area?.

If some of you that live in Miami have some used parts that you would
want to sell please let me know too.

I need:

Cylinder heads (1.7lt)
Right side rear view mirror (chrome)
Roof light
Any other stuff you would like to get rid off that I would probably
need.

Regards,

Pedro Vivas
Venezuela.
