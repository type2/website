i'm looking for a passenger side wiper arm [think they're the same for each
side] for a '71 westy. mine fell off during a severe thunderstorm in
oklahoma [and was promptly crunched under my right rear tire] last week on
my way home from the southwest. i'll be needing one real soon to get the
bus inspected in massachusetts. if you have one you'd be willing to sell,
pmail me. motorworks doesn't seem to have this, and i can't find it on the
bus depot site, either. Auto Zone practically laughed at me, but the nice
woman at the counter was quickly astonished to see that they hardly carried
any VW wiper arms. it can even be real ugly - as long as it works, i'll be
happy with it.

also, i'm looking for the interior door handle for the sliding door. $2.99
Kmart vice-grips are working ok for now, but i'd rather have the real thing.

thanks,
-perry
