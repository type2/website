Subject: Engine parts for a rebuild.
Message-Id: &lt;199906200014.TAA21662_at_ux8.cso.uiuc_dot_edu&gt;

Hi List,

	For those of you out that there rebuild engines yourself, I have a
question.  Where do you go to get new parts?  Simple things and the more
complex things ... i.e. cylinders, starters, foil, insulation, even nuts
and bolts.

	I am located in the midwest - Chicagoland area - but I don't see
that as a huge problem, for I'll have to have things shipped anyway.

	Any suggestions would be apprecaited.  I have a 1800cc, carberated
1974 VW Bus.

	Thanks,
	  Wade
