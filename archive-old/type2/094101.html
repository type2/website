&gt; One of the things I need to know is if there is a way to repair rusted fuel

How small?  They were only about one inch long to begin with.  Do they still
have a bend in them?

&gt; section that is removable but I couldnt tell.  I have a feeling it is not
&gt; replaceable.  I ordered the Bentley for the bus but i was curious in the
&gt; meantime.  Also I was wondering if anyone knew of a good place to get a full
&gt; set of replacement fuel lines for this engine (metal and rubber lines).  I

I did my tank and replaced my fuel lines a couple of months ago.

IIRC, there are two size, 7.5mm and 10mm.  A small 10mm section goes between
the outlet of the fuel filter to the inlet of the fuel pump.

If you search the archives you'll find a lot of talk about getting 7.5mm
line from the Mercedes dealer for $15/ft.  It's up to you.

5/16&quot; is a little too big.  7mm is a little too small so it should squeeze
on ok. Bus Depot and Bus Boys both sell 7mm Continental FI fuel line.

There are two metal lines underneath: long one from tank to fuel filter;
short one from pressure regulator to tank return I think.  They aren't
available to my knowledge.

I replaced mine with fuel hose as a *temporary* measure until I can find
some new pipe and get it bent to the same shape.  The original pipe I kept
seems to be copper plated steel.
