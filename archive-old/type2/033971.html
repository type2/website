Subject: Grab Handle for Terrified Passenger

OK, now that Zorm (my 58 single cab) accelerates like my 914 :-), my
passengers are complaining about nothing to hold on to.  I don't have any
door pulls, no dash grab handle, nothin.  

What I was thinking about was putting a nice solid metal grab handle (like
the off-roaders use) on the frame above the passenger door (about where your
hand would be if you held your arm out in front of you with your elbow bent
up at 90 degrees).  Actually, I've been thinking about the same thing in my
73 Westy as well.  It would help my short er... I mean lovely wife get in
and out of the buses as well.  Anybody ever done it, seen it, or know any
good reason not to?

Any and all replies and suggestions welcome.  Thanks.
