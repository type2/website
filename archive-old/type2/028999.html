Hope you guys can help me out!  My '78 bus wouldn't start the other
morning after I came out of work, so it was towed to my VW mechanic who
is, at this point, unable to figure out what is wrong.  The symptoms are
this: starts up but then dies right out unless you sit and give it gas
for like 30 second or so; idles kind of rough until it has been running
while; take it out of gear and occaisionally the oil light flickers on,
even when it has enough oil.  The things my mech has checked so far and
found to be ok include: the control unit for the EFI, the fuel pump, the
cold start valve.  He say the other four fuel injectors are not cycling
right and that there could be several things causing this.  Any idea? 
Thanks in advance, as always.  Beth and &quot;Prudence&quot; the '78 bus in NJ
