&gt; In working with my lights the past few weeks it has come very clear to me that I need to replace my housing seals. It could use it all the way around. I've checked BusDepot, they dont seem to carry them. RMMW is the only vendor who I have found carries em, and I've noticed most of their stuff is pretty pricey.  Anyone know of anyplace else? My local FLAPS closed down a few months ago, and boy do I miss them. 

Bus Depot claims that they can get and carry everything that is in the
RMMW catalog (probably buy it wholesale?) but it is less expensive.  I
personally buy occasionally from RMMW just so they keep me on thier
mailing list and send me that great catalog.

BTW, Turn on your word wrap!
