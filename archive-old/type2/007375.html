Hey All,

My carb (34-3 POS) on my '69 Westys 1600sp will not idle consistantly.
Part of the problem is that the choke is shot and permanently
dissabled by a mechanic. Sometimes, even after warmup, it won't idle
at a stop light. 

I get tired of restarting it at every light! The only way to keep it
running is to coast up at a stop light with left foot braking and
right foot reving! Difficult at best, dangerous at worst:-(

The only viable solution I see is to increase my idle speed. Will this
pose any problems (other than slight increase in fuel consumption)?
Any ideas?

Please don't say &quot;get a new carb&quot;, as I don't have the cash (even if I
did, I wouldn't buy another POS 34-3).

PS-all of my electrical connections are good on the carb and there are
no vacuum leaks (that I can tell).

Jaime
'69 Westy
