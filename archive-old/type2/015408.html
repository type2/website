&gt;&gt; &gt; Need to replace my rear shoes on my '70 westy.  I can't find a 46 mm

&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt;  Metric IS standard. How much more standard can you get?
&gt;
&gt;It is standard, but in backwards countries like the youess the
&gt;inch-measure sockets are a _lot_ cheaper! 

You can get cheap metric tools no less than you can get cheap English
tools. If your into cheap, you can get anything. Consume cheap products.
Build the Chinese and Mexican economies.

&gt;&gt; &gt; Kooky math teacher

&gt;&gt;  ..and this from a maths teacher. Words fail me.
&gt;
&gt;Shouldn't a mathmatics teacher be expected in work in _any_ units with
&gt;equal ease?  How about those .0000023-fortnight sockets? :)

Words don't fail me. Cheese and rice, and I gave the formula that he/she
should have had no problem recalling from memory, much less looking up. It
disturbs me greatly that a math teacher cannot convert the two most common
current standards of measure in the world. That really is lame. This rates
an F in a sixth grade class, in my mind.
