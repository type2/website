&gt; By flywheel seal I assume you mean the large one, not the o ring?  The

Yes I mean the seal.  The o ring was also replaced but there was nothing odd
about that one.

Maybe it got loose and was spinning in
&gt; the case and bored it out?  One year doesw not seem old- I first
&gt; replaced mine in 94 after 16yrs on the original!

Neither of the last two have lasted one year. Brazilian and mexican.

Does another seal
&gt; also seem loose?

Haven't tried yet.  That was why I was asking the list.  To see if I needed
to or if others have had success or similar circumstances.
