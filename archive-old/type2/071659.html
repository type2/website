Subject: Seats stink!!
To: type2_at_lenti.type2_dot_com

Hi list
     Wondering if anyone has come across this before.  
     Recently I purchased a parts bus (rusted out underside) that had been a 
transporter passenger bus, converted to a homemade weekender. The original 
rear seats had been out of the bus for apparently many years, as they are in 
very, very good condition and appear to have never been recovered. 
     Howevere, this bus had been sitting still for the last 2 years. PO had 
put the rear seats inside the bus for storage during this time.  The window 
seals leaked water down onto the shag carpeting, creating a wonderful musty, 
wet carpet smell in an otherwise enclosed bus.
     So, now these VG condition seats stink like musty carpet. Of course 
tried scrubbing them, etc.  Smell is still there. 
     It would seem a crime to take apart seats that have factory covers on 
them, that have no rips or tears anywhere.
     Is there anything besides hanging air fresheners in the bus that a 
fellow could do to eliminate, or at least reduce, this awful &quot;Grandma's 
basement&quot; smell?

  TIA
