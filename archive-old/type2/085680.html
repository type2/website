Subject: Re: [T2] Cruise Control





Rick

Well I am 69 years slow. Running a three wire (black white green with orange 
vinyl cover extension cord) cable from front to back took the most time. I 
wanted the control to be of dash just over the ash tray.

The driver side rear corner of the engine compartment was empty and the head 
liner was torn out so I had an easy setup.

I ran the orange hunk of extension cable above the windows on the drivers 
side, drilled a hole from inside the rear corner into the top of drivers air 
intake and dropped it down to the rear corner where I installed the servo 
unit.

Total time hook up and all approx 16 hrs over 3 or 4 days.

The kit is on sale from JC Whitney's for $89.99. 81US0344U I didn't need the 
vacuum canister. (9.99). The kit at Pep Boys was $100 but I was able to turn 
down a kit that had the seal broken on it. I ordered two more kits (for our 
other cars) from JCW, one had the seal broken but every thing was there.

DISCLAIMER
I don't know much about Audiovox or its products. I asked them an email 
question and never got an answer(what is the off mode current drain? It is ~ 
5 MA). I am not in a position to recommend the safety of this or any other 
cruise control device. I would be good to have a pro to check it out and 
remain alert when it is operating. Read Donald Gibbons account of test 
driving his installed CCS-100.

&gt;Hi and thank your for your post, I read it with interest. I have also been 
&gt;thinking about doing this, can I ask two questions of you? First, how much 
&gt;was the setup from Pepboys? Second, how long did it take you to do the 
&gt;installation? Thanks again, Rick Charles Watson wrote: Hi Long Distance 
&gt;Drivers ( with numb right feet),
&gt;
&gt;I installed a cruise control in my 77 (manual) bus following Donald Gibbons 
&gt;cruise control article in the Type 2 library.
&gt;
&gt;This involved the installation of a , CCS-100 (from Pepboys) on our 1977 VW 
&gt;van. I got the courage to do the job from Donald Gibbons great library 
&gt;article.
&gt;
&gt;I used the same loop constants as in the article : Settings. PPM - 5000 
&gt;Speed signal - Tach only Sensitivity - High (low power/heavy vehicles) 
&gt;Control Sw - Norm open Tach source select - coil
&gt;
&gt;I did back off on the throttle lever arm attachment point from hole 2 to 
&gt;hole 3. The lowers the loop gain a little but on a brief test drive the 
&gt;loop seemed tight enough. The loop is too tight to control the engine RPM 
&gt;with the bus out of gear. (It pops right out as soon as I try to engage 
&gt;it.) But it operated smoothly at 55 and 65 MPH (in 4th).
&gt;
&gt;I installed the servo unit inside the engine compartment with out trimming 
&gt;any of the wires (just coiled them up). So much for noisy engine 
&gt;compartment fears.
&gt;
&gt;I also welded the weird washer to the lever arm to reduce slop.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;My hat is off to Donald Gibbons.
