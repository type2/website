&lt;&lt; I replaced today the same elec. switch contacts on one I had replaced less 
than 2 years ago. I think you got a new switch that is garbage out of the 
box. Just poor contact from bad tolerances in manufacture. You can prove 
this fault with an ohm meter.  &gt;&gt;

Not to ride a hobby horse, but I wonder how much of this (I'm on sev-
