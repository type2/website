Thnaks Fred,

We all could use something to drool over.  A Pop Up
Polo with several choices of diesel engines sounds
fantastic to this diesel lover.  I wonder if we'll see
them in Canada (I'm in the USA).  I'll bet they're
expensive. Too bad the Polo doesn't have as  long a
wheel base as the Cooke.  From their specs, the hard
top Cooke looks like it has 7.7 ft of headroom!  I
think I'd still rather have the garageable Pop Up
Polo, however.

Rob
