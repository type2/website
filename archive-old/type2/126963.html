Subject: 1 bumper bolt cap left in the US

For anyone who is interested, I know this is a hard-to-find part....
I located one black cap (211707192), yes, only one!  It's in Wooster, Ohio at Performance Vw (800)589-8797
I know it's only one..but, it's probably the last one in the US, maybe the world!
So, if anyone needs 1, or wants to sell it on Eb*y, give them a call.
Happy Friday, -Chris
