Just an after-thought question to ask about the Best Bus thread.

I bought a very nice '75 camper due mainly to condition/price and limited
choices for purchase. I really thought I wanted a 76--79 camper because I
liked the cabinets out of the way and more compact along the side wall instead
of taking up space behind the two seats like mine do.

Camping in cold weather for the Hippie Day Tour a few weeks ago and having to
share the warmer bottom bed with my son who is bigger than I am got me to
thinking--the bed must be narrower in the side-cabinet version of the camper.
Since there were lots of late-model loafs and vanagons to look at I did in
informal survey and the bed is a lot narrower!  Several owners commented they
always sleep in the top bunk unless it is extremely cold due to the larger
bed.

Anybody else have a comment about the size of the two beds?  I now have a new
appreciation for the warmer, larger '75 bottom bunk.
