Subject: gas heater / auxillary battery?

We have decided to get a gas heater and after calling four or five
different dealers we finally found the one to go with.  We almost
settled on getting one from &quot;J.B.&quot; but we finally got through to Ark
Marvis.  Although JB's offer was reasonable his delivery time wasn't(not
to mention his sour attitude).  The heater he was suggesting would have
required removing the middle shelf under the sink and cutting a large
hole for ducting.  On the other hand the heater that Ark Marvis
recommended (for the same price of $550) mounts under the rear seat/bed
and requires only a small hole to be made for the exhaust.  This is
really nice however the really neat part about this set up this optional
programable timer.  This is a brand new electrical timer with a liquid
crystal display.  It shows the time, date, temperature, and can be
programmed to independently start up three times a day.  With this set
up we can have a toasty warm camper waiting for us in the morning to
take us to school and then to take us home.  We sure are looking forward
to having heat for the first time ever in a type 2.  All german parts
too.

We don't sell these...blah, blah, blah....disclaimer.



For the next subject:

What kind of auxillary battery goes in the engine compartment?

We have a '76 Deluxe Westfalia and the wiring is already there.  If
anyone knows the exact specs please let us know.


One more question.  There is a red wire encased in black that looks like
it runs straight to the back.  It runs right past the brake fluid
resevoir. Does anyone know what this goes to?
