Subject: P-Brake Problem Solved

     Saturday I posted a question about p-brake adjustment. The p-brake on my 
'76 Westy has not worked since I bought it 3 yrs ago, despite the fact that 
the PO had a complete brake job done on it 3 months before I bought it, to 
the tune of $245.00, from a &quot;professional&quot; VW repair shop. I've tried and 
tried to get it adjusted over the past 3 yrs., never could get it right. 
Saturday I was determined to finally get it working. Here is what I found. 
The lever the p-brake cable hooks to has an offset to it, and the offset 
should be facing out, toward you as you look at the rear hub. Therefore, 
there is a left side lever and a right side lever, and they are not 
interchangeable, but they were flipped on mine. If they are one the wrong 
side, the lever cannot move enough to fully engage the brake. If this is 
stated in either Bentley or Muir, I didn't see it. I thought this was worth 
mentioning, never take it for granted that things were installed correctly, 
even when done by a &quot;pro&quot;.
