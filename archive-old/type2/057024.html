Subject: VW's at Bandimere (Colorado) / Drag Racing

Just wanted to know if anybody has any information, or is planning to
attend this event? If your coming from Wyoming (Ginger Nipps . . .),
perhaps I can meet you at the Fort Collins exit (CO Hwy 14).
Bandimere (for all the rest of yous) is our NHRA dragway in Denver, CO.

I was out of the country until just a few days ago and saw this event
written down in my calender. Thinking about draging the bus. Does anyone
have any info on the typical bus drags, as well as any advice for extra
normal things to do for preperation for a '77 Westy w/ a 2.0 FI engine?

TIA,
Chris
