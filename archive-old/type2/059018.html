Subject: FS: 67 Double CAB, Long Beach CA

The 67 Double Cab that I recently went and looked at for Stephen G. is
still on the market and the owner just called me and said that he has
reduced the price from $8,500 to $7,500.  I posted a picture of it on my
web page if anyone is interested.  If after looking over the details
below and looking at the picture, I can email a ZIP file with a dozen or
so photos of the truck.

I AM NOT THE SELLER OF THIS TRUCK, THE OWNER DOES NOT HAVE EMAIL AND
His name is Jeff

Roof color, dark green metallic

Lower half, dark green metallic
Chrome VW on front

Interior, is missing panels, he has them ordered from wolfsburg west but
has not paid for them yet

roof panel is sagging a bit where the support just behind the air inlet
has been removed.

Dash looked good, he put his stereo bungied into the parcel tray.
speakers are kicking around in speaker boxes, no holes cut for them.

Brand new crew cab gas heater, still in original box goes with the
package.

he has had the truck in a few shows.
he is the 3rd owner

Well now the bottom line,
He has dropped his price from $8.500 to $7,500 and is negotiable.  
He has had only kids come by and he is afraid as to what they might 
do to the truck.  

His name is Jeff
