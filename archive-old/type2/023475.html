david... thank you for responding. i was waiting for a short road trip
to see how the bus was running.
the new carbs make a world of difference. it runs so good , it's scary.
we did not use the brake booster for the other vacuum port. we chose the
egr valve at the top of the manifold as we do not use them. it has been
working like a charm.

we threw 3 adults and 3 children in it yesterday and drove up the hill
to jamestown to ride the goosebump train. ran nice and cool, no
straining and did great.

we'll see how it goes over the altamont later this week. thanks for the
input.
