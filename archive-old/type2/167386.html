Subject: Re: spare tire nose mount stock?

Eddie Goodwin writes: 

&gt; To settle an argument, what years (if any) did the bus come with a
&gt; spare tire mounted on the front from the factory?
 

Ahhh,, what factory? 

I am not the expert here, but afaik.. Volkswagen Factory did not mount the 
spare to the nose... they put a well in the back from about 67 on to hold 
the spare,, before about 67,,, it was under the driver seats... and way 
before that,, It was above, or beside the engine... Barn Door era 


I am assuming Westfalia factory added the spare on the nose.. but then 
again.. maybe the Volkswagen dealers did it.. like the gas heaters.
