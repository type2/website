Steve,

If your steering wheel is not level, the person who did the alignment
screwed up.  The adjustment points on a breadloaf bus differ from almost
every other car ever made.  The right side tie rod is adjustable, but the
left side rod is not.  Instead, the drag link that goes from the
steering box to the relay arm is the adjustment point for the left
wheel.  The proper way to do an alignment is to center the steering box,
adjust the left wheel by lengthening or shortening the drag link, then
adjusting the right wheel by adjusting the right side tie rod.

Having gotten that said, there are two ways to fix this problem and I am
going to give both without opinion as to which is better:

1) The easy way is to pop the steering wheel off and re-mount it with the
spokes level.  To do this you will need:
   a puller that fits the steering wheel; (not necessary for all years,
                                          but I think you will need this)
   a 27mm socket;  (mine is, I *think* yours is too, but measure)
   a level; and
   a big flat parking lot.

Drive the van across the lot at low speed with your hands off the wheel
for ~ 50-100 feet.  Put it in neutral and let it drift to a stop, without
touching either the brakes or the wheel. At this point, stop and think:
did the van drift to the side?  If it did, stop here and go back to the
guy who screwed up your alignment ('cause he *really* did a bad job!).
Get him to do it again, right. Otherwise you will build this drift into
your steering.  If the van drifted to a stop in a straight line, get out
socket, disconnect the horn wire and remove the nut fastening the wheel
on.  Unscrew the switches for the turn signals/wipers. Use the puller to
get the wheel off and reposition it using the level.  Screw the nut back
on, the switches on and the horn wire on.  Done.

2) The hard way.  For this you will need tie rod puller, level, parking
lot, and a friend.  Do the same drive with the same caviat.  When the van
stops, climb out, block it, and get under the bus.  Remove the front pan,
and the straight end of the drag link.  The drag link is the rod that goes
from the steering box to the relay arm.  You will need the puller to do
this.  DO NOT USE A FORK!  They damage the end that they are used on and
we want to save you the ~$50.00 a new drag link costs.  After the drag
link is off, have your friend level the wheel and hold it.  The drag link
can be screwed in and out to lengthen or shorten it, you want to adjust it
'til it just drops into the socket with the wheel level, then screw it
back down.  Use a new cotter pin, please.

I have done both of these and am happier with procedure 2, but will admit
that 1) is easier and cannot think of a reason not to do it this way.
Any flames?  (Please!)  I am no expert, and am just describing things I
have done that worked.  If there is a long-range danger, please post, as I
feel steering is just behind brakes (and way ahead of engine) in relative
importance.
