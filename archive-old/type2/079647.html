&gt;OK Volks, It's friday so I'll share a few of my Cops&amp; Bus's tales.

Me too. Got out of the Navy in July 1995. Was travelling from Norfolk to=20
Chattanooga.

Problem was - I was by myself had two cars to ferry. Had just completed a=20
Type IV conversion for my Beetle and thought I had a rocket ship (stock 2.0=
=20
with dual carbs, dual exhaust - a wee bit more power - 15 or 20 HP?) so I=20
towed my Hyundai Excel (cheap trade I couldn't pass up - not emotionally=20
attached to it I promise!&lt;Grin!&gt;) with that '65 Beetle. Figured that it=20
would be cheaper than the Hyundai to repair if I killed it. I was also=20
hauling everything I owned in the world including spare VW parts, tools,=20
and clothes. Both cars were well loaded!

The Beetle had disc brakes all around - as if it was worth much - the=20
Hyundai had a nasty habit of trying to push me sideways on a hard stop...=20
It's called Physics son!

Left for points south at nightfall with intentions of driving all night.=20
Cooler temps for me, cooler temps for that Type IV. I had added oil=20
pressure, oil temps and cylinder head temp gauges.

Got to Salem, VA on old Hwy. 58 running west when I crested a hill and=20
started down into a valley. I noticed a fellow down the hill ahead with a=20
flash light trying to get me slowed down. Down the hill further was a whole=
=20
gaggle of blue lights. Seems the local law was checking registration,=20
license, and for general sobriety.

I proceeded to gear down and brake for the stop at the bottom. Running over=
=20
a state trooper might be a bad way to get started with those fellows. Dual=
=20
carbs and dual exhaust (quiet packs) really broke the relative silence and=
=20
I saw them look in my direction - possibly the guy at the top told them=20
heads up on the radio - crazy (stupid) hippy approaching. Hey - I ain't no=
=20
hippy!

Got stopped okay but a cloud of oily smoke sort of circled the car - I had=
=20
removed the OEM thermostat system when I added the BAS cooling and that=20
included the cable pulley and it's bolt. Hey - guess what? That left the=20
oil pan open and able to leak oil all over everything. All okay on the=20
flats but the hills and curves caused oil to leak all over and fly back=20
onto the exhaust pipes causing lots of smoke and an layer of oil covered=20
the Hyundai. It took $10 at the car wash to wash it off once we got to TN.=
=20
The car never rusted though!

I stopped the engine worrying if I would have trouble starting it again=20
(hot VW starter syndrome) &amp; IF they let me go. License, registration and=20
general looks of disbelief. I figured there were at least 30 or 40 reasons=
=20
they would ticket me on the spot. I couldn't afford $5K in fines!

You see the Hyundai was registered still to the previous owner and expired.=
=20
Certainly uninsured. The Beetle had ITALIAN plates on it still and the=20
registration was in Italian. My insurance was Italian and I bet that wasn't=
=20
worth squat in Virginia either. My Hyundai lighting was simply the parking=
=20
lights aided by a hot wire leading from the Beetle to the Hyundai to keep=20
the battery charged. The hitch was a good one though -  TUV approved. The=20
towbar was a Tompken Machine towbar from Colorado.

Also I had no seatbelts in the Beetle and the body was bolted to the pan in=
=20
only a few of the places it was supposed to. You see I was young, single=20
and invincible. Yes - a serious safety hazard to say the least.

Would they check or care or would they put me straight into jail?

Took about 7 minutes of asking where I was coming from and where I was=20
going and why and a few more questions about the vehicle papers, etc.=20
However stupid I might have been I wasn't drunk so they set me on my way. I=
=20
turned the key and the engine fired right up. Temps were stable at 220=B0=
 oil=20
and 350=B0 heads.

It was a careful climb up the other side of the valley - I had it floored=20
in 2nd and 3rd gear (under 45 mph) and sounded like I was running at least=
=20
230 miles per hour. I just knew one trooper might have to catch me again=20
and hand me the tickets they had forgotten to in their surprise back in the=
=20
valley.

I made it to Chattanooga without a single VW failure. Used lots of oil, did=
=20
better on gas that I expected (20's I think), and maintained 60 mph or so=20
on the interstate. Climbed the mountain in the early morning light and fog=
=20
where I grew up in Chattanooga with a full sized van of spectators=20
following who refused to pass - I suppose betting for breakfast on whether=
=20
I could make the climb...

Got a half dozen thumbs up when they finally passed me near the top - the=20
Beetle really grinding along at 25 mph. In several of the harder turns body=
=20
roll put the CV joints at large angles which led them to complain and pop=20
until the body settled to flat again...

Never, never, ever again....
