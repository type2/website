Subject: Clutch Components

  Hey All,  I have an interest in the clutch thread here 'cause I have
tried a variety of clutch guts and can put in my 2 cents worth.
There were two main setups.  BIG difference is in the pressure plate.
Flywheel and clutch plate are the same, but the pressure plates
and throwout bearings cannot be interchanged.  The old kind of bearing is
flatter, more like a doughnut, and it is to be used with the type of
pressure plate that has a ring suspended on three levers.  On the newer
setup ('72 on) the t/o bearing has kind of a tube around the trans shaft
and extends into the newer type pressure plate with metal 'fingers'
radiating centrally.  It is possible to put the clutch together with the
wrong parts mixed together.  What I did was put the new pressure plate
with an old t/o bearing.  It worked for a while, but the 'fingers' got weak
and more clutch adjustment was required.  Finally the bearing began to
rub on the fingers, and one of the t/o retaining clips was worn in half.
It didn't ruin anything, but I had to chuck that pressure plate, and
go back to the old kind.  I feel that the old setup is less prone to
chattering because the plate is not as springy as with the fingers.
IF your clutch is chattering try to burn off any oil by slipping the
the clutch in 4th gear for a couple of seconds.  This has helped me,
but if your plate is oil soaked forget it.  You will have to replace
the plate.  If a clutch is continually shuddering like that the case
will be hammered to death by the thrust bearing eventually.  How do
I know?  I committed the  sin of skimping on the clutch plate...
and I paid with blood, sweat, and tears.  The case was shot. 8(

  Drive on,  Chris
