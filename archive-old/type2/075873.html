Subject: Re: [T2] Question on smog

[...]


&gt; A friend needs to replace what I think is inside the filler tub that stops
&gt; you from putting leaded gas in the bus.  Dose anyone know what this might be
&gt; and can you remove this part or is it part of the filler tube?

I am assuming your friend has a 75 and up bus? [cause the 71 in your sig never
had a catalytic converter on it]
Originally, the 'fillpipe restricter' was molded into the filler neck. That
style is no longer available......then again neither is leaded fuel in the US at
gas stations. If he has a metal insert, someone may have had to install it to
pass the visual part of a smog check. Most are not removable without destroying
the rubber neck, they tried to make them tamper-proof.
