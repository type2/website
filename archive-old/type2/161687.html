Subject: RE: [T2] How about posts of best &quot;workarounds&quot;?

Best van work-around so far, heater box &quot;Y&quot; and boxes disintergrated on 77 
westie, used rear seat heat duct as place to fab a steel box, put in 
propane/fan heater (I believe it's called a HeaterBuddy), and back fed heat 
from there throughout the van, eliminated big tube in center up to the front 
beam, feeds everything, including defrost.

Personal best so far, driving with girlfriend in her Autobianchi in Sicily, 
car dies.  Pull distributor cap, rotor falls out in pieces.  She had scotch 
tape rattling around in car.  Re-assembled rotor and held together with 
scotch tape, made connection between center and tip of rotor with chewing 
gum tin, drove 28 miles back to base (Sigonella) to hobby shop.
