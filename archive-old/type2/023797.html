Subject: Oil Pump Cover Nuts
Content-type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII

I'm in the home stretch putting my engine together (after a major - for me -
disassembly and cleaning), and am putting the oil pump cover on.  When I took
it off, the nuts (all 4) had red plastic-like rings (?) that fit in a serrated
depression in the nut between the cover and the side of the nut in contact
with it.  I've searched the archives in vain looking for advice on how to seal
this and what the red stuff is that I found.  I dont think it was loctite
since they came off without much effort, but didn't seem to leak.  Also, does
anyone use gasket sealer on the pump cover gasket?  If so, what kind, and
exactly where?  

Thanks
