Subject: Re: front curtains/trim

the following are two tips which come from the vanagon list. I apologize to
the authors as I do not have their names but you can look it up in the
vanagon archives (http://gerry.vanagon_dot_com/archives/vanagon.html ) (you can
search the archives via your browser but it's slow, better is to use the
suggested e-mail search, look for &quot;trim&quot;).

A. Remove the moulding, soak in hot water, and stretch it out.  Reinstall
with light weight adhesive.


B. from the archives:
&quot;Before you try this trick, you need to pull the moulding off of the table
or cabinet.  I use a heat gun (you can probably use a potent hair-dryer).
Gently and evenly apply heat until the moulding is pliable.  Gently and
evenly are the key words here;  too much heat in one place will discolor
or melt the plastic.  It will stretch very easily (pay attention, and
don't stretch it too much!).  Once I had mine the correct length, I
drilled holes in the mouldings, about 2 inches from each end, and then
reinstalled the mouldings.  I then used the holes in the mouldings as
guides to drill small pilot holes in the cabinet, and secured the
mouldings using automotive trim screws.  The appearance is excellent, and
there has been no subsequent shrinkage.  I have done this on my 1971
(white mouldings), 1983 (brown mouldings) and 1987 (grey mouldings) over
the past fifteen years or so with great results.&quot;

There were also suggestions to heat it in an oven or microwave but I can't
find that info. Generally you want to heat it to a pliable temperature,
strech it and reattach it. It should last again a few years.

	Karl.
