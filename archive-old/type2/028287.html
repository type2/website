&gt; 1) What is the fuel capacity for the '74 - '79 bus? 15 gallons?

Assuming you're interested in the *useful* fuel capacity, my experience
(only once, luckily, and in town) was that when my '79 started cutting out
due to fuel starvation, it took about 14.6 gallons to refill it.  If there
was anything more in the tank, it wasn't doing me any good.

Cheers,
Alistair
'79 Westy
