Subject: Re: [T2] sucking sound (will not idle until hot)

Gary,
I have the exact same symptoms on a 75 bus- Starts fine, runs 30
seconds, and drops to stalling.  When hot it idles fine.  The
troubleshooting chart says to check temp sensors and aux air valve -
mine lets air through when it is cold, shuts it when hot, so that is not
it.  My hoses seem fine, but the sould I believe is the air going
through the air valve.  The &quot;brain&quot; gives longer injection pulses when
the sensor resistance is high (1500-2500 ohms), and the aux air valve
lets extra air in to produce a faster, funtional idle.  I thought it was
not giving the right pulses and switched the ECU, same symptoms.  So we
warm it up to oil temp of 170 or higher with a weight on the gas pedal
and it runs fine.

 idle drops so low that it dies.  After the engine warms up it runs
 okay...but idles really rough.
