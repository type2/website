Subject: ready to bleed breaks

I have a mightyvac brake bleeder which is believe is what bentleys
describes as a preasure bleeder.  I'm not really sure how to use this.
Bentleys says hook it up to the reservoir.  Is this the break fluid
reservoir under the drivers seat?  I don't see how to hook this hand pump
up to it.  Also the calipers have two bleeder valves.  Which valve do I
use?  Any pointers in using this thing?

Shocks are on!  New brake line bent and installed!

:)
