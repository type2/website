[...]

Taking a few ramps a little faster than intended, in the rain and/or sloppy
snow, provides a brief but intensive tutorial in Type 2 handling
characteristics.

In my experience with a '68 hardtop Westy and a '70 poptop Westy the
ultimate &quot;stance&quot; is definitely understeer.  It can be manipulated by
judicious application and release of the brakes.

Oversteer can be induced, especially at higher speeds, but ultimately [at
least with stock ride height, suspension, and tire inflation] understeer
rules.

FWIW.....

&gt;&gt;  Wow!  You actually push your bus hard enough that you can tell that the
front wheels break loose before the rears?  I always thouight that VWs
oversteered (rear end breaks first) due to the rearward CG.  I've never
been brave enought to test this practically, though.  &lt;&lt;
