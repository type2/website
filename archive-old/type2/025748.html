&gt; 
&gt; I've been lucky enough to score work space in a professional shop in town,
&gt; and as I sat in the barrel of Safety-Kleen scrubbing my grubby tin in
&gt; preparation for a marriage with an AVP longblock, I got to wondering: Why do
&gt; we paint tin? I've always been told Rustoleum, maybe the high-heat kind.
&gt; Presumably this is a dumb question, but I guess the underside will rust if
&gt; it's wet.
&gt; 
&gt; Er, will it?
&gt; 
&gt; Cheers,
&gt; Ian

The top will rust too, and it's not a question of &quot;if&quot; it gets wet--there is
water vapor in the atmosphere, which will rust your tin very nicely all by
itself.

POR-15 makes an Engine Enamel which should be good stuff. In the States,
we've got Barbecue Paint which many people swear by.
