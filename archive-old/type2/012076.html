I just drove my '69 camper to Indianapolis and then Ann Arbor, MI and
then to Baltimore and back to DC.   I have been watching this list for
about a month and i don't  have easy access to the archives so i will
just ask my question.  Does anyone know how to calibrate the speedometer.
 I have not yet exactly determined my speed.  I think i show about 80 to
between 65 and 72 and 70 to go 55-60.  It also screws up my actual
mileage.

help,
scott

more on Friday, lots of time to think.
