Subject: 72 tranny needed

Folks, Maude has no reverse as of my coffee stop this
AM. Bummer. it has been going out for months, but this
morning was the final stray, requiring me to push it
backwards. Ahhhh, so true.  Does anybody have a good
72-compatiable transaxle they want to sell? it must be
known good, and not something that was found laying in
the back seat of a rig your picked up last year...

will pay and trade for the 6-rib core too.

thanks
