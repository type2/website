Subject: Re: [T2] Remote starter location

You'll poke your eye out!
(If you make a direct connection betewwen ground and battery positive.)

The necessary connection for remote start function is between
battery positive, either at the battery positive post or at the starter
end of the battery positive cable and the ignition solenoid spade terminal
coming from the ignition switch.This is the function of the ignition circuit
Connecting the two large hot terminals at the starter will bypass the pull-in
winding of the solenoid. The starter will spin but not engage the flywheel.
There is no reason to use a ground connection anywhere in your plan.
The starter motor is directly grounded to the trans.

&gt; I just picked up a simple remote starter. Directions say to plug the black
&gt; wire to a ground (got it) and the red wire to the starter's positive. Since
&gt; the starter has two positive power sources, which one, the main terminal or
&gt; the ignition terminals?

&gt; Just don't want to fry any thing.
