&gt; ...that is the question. I set my 74 1800, dual carbs, stock, to 10* ATDC static as suggested in Muir &amp; Bentley. Now it runs terribly! It had been previously set to 4* BTDC and ran well, with the exception of the low idle miasma I'm puzzling through.

          Uhhh, no, the manual certainly didn't tell you to set it at 10 ATDC static. It said to set it at that with the engine running, at idle, with all vacuum hoses connected. Major difference. If you want to set it static to start off, you should try 10BTDC to begin. Then set it with the light for a total advance of around 43-44 BTDC.
