Correct.
	
&gt;	initial run-on was caused by an overly rich mixture here at sea level,

Maybe.  My bus has been jetted rich and lean and I've had the runon problem
both ways.  I'm not convinced it has anything to do with the main jets.

&gt;	Am I right in this reasoning?  If so, I need to readjust my carbs here
&gt;(lean them out a bit) but I also need to know how to adjust carbs for
&gt;subsequent runs up to Tahoe.  Did an archive check and it turns out jets
&gt;are the thing to change... could I get away with fiddling with the
&gt;volume screw instead?  I don't really feel like changing the jets for
&gt;each ski trip...

The volume control screws will only help your idle.  If you want to
seamlessly adjust for altitude, convert to fuel injection.  Seriously.
Carburators are not capable of adjusting themselves for altitude - the best
you can do is jet the carb to run best at the altitude you drive in most,
which in your case would be at or slightly above sea level.  I should
mention that not all fuel injections can adjust for altitude, I believe
only those with a mass-air sensor can do it.  I'm not sure which year
busses have mass-air sensors on them, probably only the later ones - I'll
have to let someone more knowledgeable about bus fuel injection address
that.
