Subject: newbie update....shazbot is apparently from mork and mindy...

wow.
    i just want to say what an oasis in the desert of automobile ownership
this list and the vw are turning out to be!  i had an 85 toyota truck.....
reliable enough, but the rod bearings lost their balls and now its a $500
flower pot....2k+ for a new engine?!?!? get real.... i knew i needed a car i
could work on and the bus is just that.
    despite pulling the engine tin like a nit-wit, (duh... the valve covers
are on the side? uh..), i adjusted the valves this morning...they were all
tighter than .004 .. except number three which was right on at .006 but
seemed abit crooked like the pushrod wasnt long enough? whats that all
about..? any way it runs like a top, i had to set the idle down even.... but
still leaks oil... i thought it was the valve cover cause it seemed to be
leaking out right there on to the exhuast pipes.... nada... i replaced the
gaskets and it still leaks alot of oil... maybe even more..? any ideas?
should i be worried or just check the oil often?  i swear it seems to be
coming out by the valve cover..
    i pulled off the intake pipes to replace the boots on the carbs and
WAHLAH! one of the center studs on the intake manifold came right out(as i
was putting it back on.... maybe should have used more wd40..),  threads and
all!.... should i get this tapped or can i get by with epoxy since its not a
loadbearing stud really and its only 1 of 4, and the center one no less....
i also couldnt get gaskets for it at the FLAPS, so i got hi-temp RTV
silicone gasket maker... is it safe to use on intake manifolds?
    also, there is sometimes a severe rumble when i get going funny in
second? will i be able to see if the tranny mounts are busted? will i be
able to replace them? i also noticed it makes an odd growl when i push in
the clutch and the bus is sitting still.  like someone is shaking a trashcan
with a hammer in it..
    once again this bus is so much fun i dont think ill ever buy a regular
car again! chicks dig it!

one more thing... is there a light for the instrument panel guages? if so,
where is it? i need to replace it so i can see if im speeding at night!

viva veedub!
