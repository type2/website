&lt;&lt; Do you secretly disable them because they make your engine run rough? &gt;&gt;

Geoff,

I read and heard that the opposite is often the case.  I personally went 
through a fair amount of effort to get mine back into working condition!!

Their purpose is to reduce NO (I think) emmissions and they do it by helping 
to LOWER your combustion chamber temp.  Its my understanding that in the air 
cooled bus engine this is something to encourage, not discourage!!

Anyway, I carefully cleaned up the valve, adjusted the linkage so the valve 
is open per Bentley specs and did a bit of welding to get the filter box 
connection to match the exhaust correctly.  I don't feel that it contributes 
at all to a poor idle, at least not in the case of my engine.
