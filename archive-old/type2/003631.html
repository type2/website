Subject: Mexican Bus Engine?

The recent posts about driving in Mexico have me curious about the engines
in the Mexican Busses.  I know the most recent ones are water cooled,
starting in about 1998.  But before that, were they type 4 design or
something else?

I'm planning on doing some driving down there later this summer, and I was
wondering if any mechanical parts would be generally available.

Regards,

Grant
