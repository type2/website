&gt; &gt; I am trying ro find the correct gear oil for the final drive for a 73 bus

&gt; &gt; multi-viscosity like 80W90.  IS it ok to use these?  Does anyone have a
&gt;
&gt; This is semi-related. It's probably the same as for a manual tranny that
&gt; requires SAE 90 GL-4 Hypoid Gear Oil. Yes, multi-vis is OK. I'm not sure
&gt; about the auto but for a manual you must find GL-4 -- NOT GL-5. If it says
&gt; GL-5 on it anywhere avoid it.

actually this is not true, an automatic final drive can indeed use either
GL-4 or GL-5 as it has no yellow metal that is affected by the higher
sulphur levels.

just remember the Hypoid Gear oil is for the FINAL DRIVE only and is put
in from under the bus.  the tranny itself gets DEXRON and it goes in the
fill in the engine compartment

&gt; Well, they've stopped carrying Sta-Lube products and now only have what's
&gt; left on hand so if you have an O'Reilly near you ask for them to check the
&gt; back for it.

I have been using Valvoline Synthetic in my auto tranny bus (final drive)
for many years.

I get it at my local FLAPS (Pep Boys)
