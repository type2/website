Subject: Re: [T2] front mounted tires.

My 77 Westy has the usual run-of-the-mill spare tire mount on the front. The
large rectangular one held on by monster pop rivets. And the spare is backwards
so you can't put a hub cap on it.
I went to a couple of junkyards today and found 2 73 Westies, almost complete.
[engines and trans were already gone.... seems like all the typeIV engines are
being bought up right away]
On one of the 73's was a different spare mount. It had 2 holes drilled in the
top of the bumper and 2 holes in the body just above the emblem. There was a
bolt plate behind the nose. It seems like this style put 100% of the spare tire
weight on the bumper. The upper nose bolts are just 6mm and keep the mount
upright. The neat things about this mount is 1) the tire stays about 1/2'' away
from the nose and 2) the wheel mounts outside out and you can put a hubcap on
it!
I could not find any brand name or makers name on it.
