I, unfortunately have not had the chance to sleep in mine.  I have a tv/vcr
combo that I will sit on top of the sink to watch &quot;Terminator&quot; in the middle
of the forest, so, head facing back for me.  I have some wooden blocks to
perch up the rear if need be : )  Anyone want to arrance some kind of
informal bus camping trip in SoCal?

In my 73 I sleep with my head towards the front. Bashed my head too many
times on the upper storage at the back.
