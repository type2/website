My guess is that the bolts were loose and the momentary stress of the
stall was the last straw.  Be happy that it didn't come loose at speed!

You need to replace all the bolts, the little plates that go between the
bolts and the CV flange, and the thin one-way-washers.  Hope that the
drive flange isn't gotched up too bad.
