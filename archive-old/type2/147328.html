&gt; Schwarze's write up from the type2 library, I fiddled with those ^%$! carbs for

&gt; Weber on it. I also today put in my vacation requests for : Everybus, Natural 
&gt; Bus, and Buses of the Corn (just a few of the events I plan to go to this 
&gt; year).  Happy Busin' in 2006!   Jeff

A backfire on decel can also be attributed to an exhaust leak. Have you 
checked for a leak?

We are also already making plans for camping season this spring!!!
