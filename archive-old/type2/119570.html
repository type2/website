Subject: Fan Broken,Broken down

 I am trying to remove the generator and I can see that the Fan has about 1/3 
of the fins missing. Something must have caused the fan to come apart.any 
suggestions on how to lift the generator fan assembly out of the tight 
compartment or do I have to drop the engine.
Any suggestions will be appreciated.
