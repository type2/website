&gt; &gt; hey all,
&gt; &gt; I may be dreaming, but I'm just curious.  How would one go about fitting
&gt; &gt; disc brakes on the rear of his '78 bus?  Would it be possible to go to
&gt; &gt; the junkyard, steal the front rotors from a late bus and slap them on
&gt; &gt; the rear of my bus?  Is this a bolt-up or are there other
&gt; &gt; considerations?  Where would the caliper mount?  What about the master
&gt; &gt; cylinder?  Would it have to be changed?
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; This will probably never happen as it would be $$$expensive but I hate
&gt; &gt; jerking around with drum brakes.

&gt; I've thought about this for my ghis. The major requirement is for 
&gt; emergency brakes. Some sort of arrangement would have to be installed.
&gt; 
&gt; Good luck

Bill and others,
That's a good point.  On cars with rear disc brakes (more and more of
those nowadays) how do they do the emergency brake?  Always been curious
about that one.
