Subject: Re: [T2] 78 bug

The buses I bought this spring were my first venture into the type2 world, 
having previously  been a type1 fan of long standing. A '78 'vert for 
$500.00? Thats insane! even if the top is completely missing thats a 
fantastic price. Where I live ANY year 'vert with no top, blown engine and 
in need of lots of rust repair is going to run close to 2k or more, and a 
'vert that is functional with only comsmetic fixes needed is going to be at 
least 3k, and often more.

The thing I miss about my sedans is how affordable everything is :( Had I 
known what a money pit I was getting invovled in I might have walked away 
from the two busses I picked up for $700.00 (seemed like such a great deal 
since I had never had to buy any type4 motor parts before, and I can rebuild 
a type1 motor with spare change.)

On a side note, I found on craigslist a couple of weeks ago a REAL clean set 
of dual solex carbs where one carb has a leak so fuel is running down the 
side of the carb for $50.00. MAN what a find! I am picking up rebuild kits 
today and I should have my 72 Westy on the road in a week or so! Not sure I 
could be more excited! Of course I have learned that the engine is a GEX 
rebuild that has low compression in one cylinder. My compression readings 
were 124 129 110 89 so I am expecting to find another 1800cc motor this 
winter and rebuild it to replace the one in the bus, then replacing the 
heads on the current motor and inspecting to see if it is a good candidate 
for a rebuild as my hotswappable spare. From what I have been reading on the 
list a reading in the 80-90 range one one cylinder is most likely a damaged 
head I think?

I put a rebuilt (unknown quality rebuild, was purchased off craigslist for 
$400.00 from a guy who had gotten it to put in his '70 bus before realizing 
how much modification he would have had to do to get it to fit) 2.0 in my 
'78. When transferring over the fuel injection from the old to new motor I 
noticed one of the fuel injectors was missing a terminal due to corrosion so 
I need to replace that injector and I want to replace the wiring harness, 
but havnt found one yet. Also replacing all the rubber lines (vac, brake and 
fuel) in that ride. I want to put in a fuel shutoff valve too, as I did not 
enjoy my fuel bath when disconnecting the engine for removal. Anyone have a 
suggestion for the best location for this? I am restoring this bus for my 
son and when it catches fire I want him to be able to stop the fuel flow 
without being in danger at all. Hopefully it is never an issue, but with all 
the work I am putting into saving these bays it just might kill me to see it 
burn down.

Most sorry for the rant. I woke up this morning in a GREAT mood after 
stopping off where I have the busses parked yesterday and realizing how 
close I am to at least being able to start both these buses! I can't hardly 
contain myself knowing this afternoon I get to stop off at the VW shop for a 
parts binge today :D

On a side note something I need to start thinking about is rust repair for 
the battery tray. What have other people found the best way to deal with 
this? I was thinking of cutting the whole corner off and buying some 
replacement sheet metaland rebuilding the corner that way, but have seen 
some listees complain about replacement sheet metal, preferring original 
metal from a donor bus. Is there a wide spread quality problem with the 
replacement panels I have seen on websites? I was under the impression I 
would be able to find a good battery corner from a donor bus, assuming any 
bus fit only as a donor wouldnt have good metal in a high failure location 
anyways.
