hey...
got to Fleet Farm or another auto place and get yourself a &quot;one man brake
bleeder kit&quot; its a little bottle with a hose in it and a magnet on it so you can
stick it to the frame.  The hose hooks up the the bleeder valve and then into
the canister...pump the brakes, fluid squirts in, but no air gets sucked back
in.  They run about $3.00 and are VERY useful..I have one myself...saves you the
hassle of the explanation to the kids.... &quot;STOP!!..ok push! stop!&quot; :-)
