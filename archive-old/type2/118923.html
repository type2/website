            New virus disguised as PayPal e-mail

            A computer virus that camouflages itself as a message from PayPal
has started spreading among home users, antivirus companies said on Friday.

            The program is a variant of the Mimail virus, which has previously
spread by appearing to be a security advisory from Microsoft. The latest
version of the program is attached to an e-mail forged to look as though it
came from PayPal, an online payment service bought by eBay last year. Running
the program infects the victim's computer and asks the PC user for credit card
information, which the virus then sends to the attacker.

            &quot;It is a new trend among virus authors to get deeper into criminal
acts and attempt to generate revenue,&quot; said Craig Schmugar, virus research
engineer for security company Network Associates.
