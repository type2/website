Brandy,

I bought a second bus recently to do the engine transmission swap 'cos 
the first one's not as good as the second.

But it's going to be hard 'cos I'm familiar with No 1 and all her 
idiosyncrasies. I don't know No 2 yet. She's just a green bus sitting 
outside my house.

I'm going to have to get to know No 2 with her 1600 engine before I swap my 
beloved 1776 into her.
