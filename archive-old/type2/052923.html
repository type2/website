Subject: hesitation/cracked hose

I have a 71 camper with 1600 dualport.  I've been experiencing a slight 
boggin at low rpms.  Its not too bad but noticeable
So the other day I noticed that there was a hose broken by the clamp.  its 
the hose that comes out of the left side of the firewall by the fuel lines 
and attaches to the manifold under the carb. the hose is about an inch in 
diameter.

I'm wondering if this is why I've been hesitating.  it has gotten worse 
since I noticed the crack.  It's been doing a few backfires too as I've been 
driving down the highway but does not do it at idle.

After searching for this hose in the books I couldn't find it.  My mechanic 
says its the brake booster.

Would this be causing my hesitation/backfiring???

Nothin left to do but smile, smile, smile!!
