&lt;&lt; What's wrong with this picture?

 &gt;&gt;

It has an old car in it...Seriously, though, you've come up against what
most old car owners face...The factory doesn't wanna hear about you
unless you're buyin' a new one and the aftermarket wants to only sell
what moves fast and cheap (their end). It's just &quot;bidness&quot; as they say
in Texas...
