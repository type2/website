Subject: Re: [T2] Exhaust header Put-Put-Put-Put

Hello,

Here is what I did with my headers.  To get a good
seal against the heads you have to file down the
surface of each oval port the same ammount. You also
have to file down the mating surfaces of the stud
flanges on the headers. To do this, I got a big flat
file, one big enough to file the surface of both ports
at the same time. Doing this will take a long time but
you want to keep filing until the oval surface of both
ports is shiny all the way arround. I tried to count
my filing strokes and do the sam number to the
flanges. This process will take awhile but it will
work. I also scuffed each port with some lighter sand
paper after I was finished filing to smooth them
alittle. Good Luck!

&gt; would hold everything in 
&gt; place, while the iffy stud did whatever it could do
&gt; to help.
