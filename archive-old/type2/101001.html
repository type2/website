&gt; &gt; At least i think it is a tranny issue.  Here is the story.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; 82 passenger van..............Stood up for about 3 years.  i put in used
&gt; &gt; better.  BUT then at around 40 mph, it shifts to 3rd.  same
&gt; &gt; story..............slow to 60 mph, even the slightest hill slows the van
&gt; &gt; down some.  Top speed I was able to get out of it was about 65 mph, on a
&gt; &gt; flat.


opps forgot
&gt; 
&gt; sounds like a 2/3 brake band slip or servo problem, make sure you have
&gt; sufficient ATF in the tranny, remember it is checked with engine warm and

AND ENGINE RUNNING

&gt; with tranny in N.  put on parking brake then slowly shift thru all the
&gt; gears P-R-N-D-2-1-2-D-N-R-P-R-N then check......should be between the
&gt; marks.
