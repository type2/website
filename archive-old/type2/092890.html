Subject: Re: [T2] towing capacity

I don't see any problem as long as the engine is in good condition and you 
aren't pushing 70 mph on the highway.

The boat ramps are pretty steep around here and that would be my main 
concern...


&gt;What if any is the max towing capacity for a 70 with a 1600dp?
&gt;I am looking at towing a small 15' fiberglass boat and a utility trailer
&gt;with a riding mower. (at different times of course)
&gt;Also I need some technical help with an outboard motor question, does anyone
&gt;know of a good site?
