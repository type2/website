Subject: [T2]Weber carbs and Vac. booster question

hi, I am planning on running a pair of weber 40 dcnfs on a 1600dp in a
71 westy.  My question is where should I drill my manifold(s) for the
booster hose.  Also do I need to drill both manifold or just one.  also
what diameter hose should i run off one or both of the manifolds. Thanks
in advance, Brian 71 westy
