Subject: Re: [T2]  Topless

 &gt;&gt;I just remove the fiberglass top from my bus. Any suggestions on 
preventing damage during storage &gt;&gt;while other working is being done. 
Thanks Steve
v
don't let it splay while it is off.  If it takes a set while its sides are 
out of position,
it may not fit tight when you put it back on and then the canvas will hang 
out the
sides of the top.  i.e., store it so that its shape isn't distorted.
