Subject: solenoid trouble

So the bus won't start all the time.  The problem is either the
solenoid or the ignition.

What I do to get it working is short the terminal on the solenoid from
the battery and the terminal to the ignition - whirr goes the starter.
 I get back in and start her up.  I find it works ifm when I short it,
I give it just a very short burst, so it's more of a  *clunk* than a
whirr.

Tomorrow I'm going to clean the ignition contact, but that's all I can
think to do.  So what's going on?  Why is this happening?  Is it the
solenoid or the ignition?  How can I check?  I've got my handy
multimeter and an iron will ready to do the work.   Suggestions?

Peace list,
 - ian
