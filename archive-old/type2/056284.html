Britt,

&gt; Had to loan my son the SP out of my Kombi and its time to replace it. I've
&gt; done a few top ends and want to do this engine right so I thought I'd ask
&gt; the collective wisdom of the list. I have a 71 DP engine out of my old bus
&gt; that I'll send the case out to be machined. Here's what I thought I'd do,
&gt; 1. Have case and heads cut for 90.5s
&gt; 2.Purchase a counterweighted crank 69 , 74, 76,? What do you think?
&gt; 3.Have rotating mass balanced for longevity
&gt;  I have a set of Kadron's to install and a new stock exhaust system to
&gt; install on this motor. I plan on installing a type 4 oil cooler and all tin
&gt; and flaps and thermostat
&gt;  I plan on about 7.1 to 7.6 CR I haven't talked to a builder yet.
&gt; Will the stock exhaust flow enough for this engine or will  I have to use a
&gt; Quiet Pack?
&gt; Any and all advice will be appreciated as well as any experiences with
&gt; similar set ups
&gt; Britt

I have a 90.5 pistons with a 69mm c/weighted crank (gives 1776CCs), a 
110 cam, 040 heads with heavy (double) valve springs. I run twin 
Kadrons with standard jetting and an S &amp; S extractor/muffler set up. 
I also have an external oil cooler but it's not full flow. 

The power/torque is great. Only have to use 3rd for big hills.
In my '72 bus I get (US)19-20mpg in rolling hill country at around 60 
-65 mph
