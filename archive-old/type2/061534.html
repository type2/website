I too am greatly saddened by the loss of my friend Josh.  He was such a nice
person, always seemed happy, interested in what you had to say.  I wish I had
the opportunity to have known him a little better.  I will miss seeing him at
the campouts and reading about his adventures on the list.

My sympathy and condolences go out to Josh's friends and family.  

We are all here because we love buses;  those wonderful hunks of metal that
brought us all together.  Buses are what we all have in common, but they have
only brought us together, the &quot;us&quot; is the important part.  Over the years I've
collected several buses, but by far I treasure the friends I've made in the
process.  I will never grieve the loss of a bus, but I do grieve the loss of a
friend.
