Subject: Re: [T2] Buses in Knoxville area??

AFAIK, it's slim pickings around here.  Whenever I go to Harriman in the next 
county to the VW mechanic I trust Lurch with (when I am unable or don't care 
to do the work myself) I will go out into his boneyard, which is small and 
well picked over.  There is another junkyard near Seymour (Hendron Chapel 
Road?) that I used to go to when I had a Ghia.  They had some buses, even a 
barndoor (I think).  It's at that end of town - toward Gatlinburg - but still 
quite a drive from there.

I just got off the phone with a few junkyards (including Lowe's mentioned 
above) and came up busless.  It doesn't look good.
