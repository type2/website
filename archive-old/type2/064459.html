Subject: FS: Transporter Service/Repair Handbooks

 I currently have for sale two copies of Clymer Productions &quot;Volkswagen
Service and Repair Handbook, Transporter,&quot; by Eric Jorgensen.  One is the 1961
- - - 1978 edition. The 338 page book has card covers, and is complete with no
page tears on pen marks inside.  It is used, with some grease marks on the
pages, and a few pen marks on the front cover.  Still very sturdy and useable.
Available for $8 plus $2 postage.  The second copy covering 1961 - 1974, is
281 pages long, showing a little more age and wear, available for $7 plus $2
postage.  If interested, please email to &quot;dcleaves_at_mitretek_dot_org&quot; for
additional info.  Thanks, and best regards.

Dave
