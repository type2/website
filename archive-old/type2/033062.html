Subject: Re: Casebolt bushings?

The last 2 gasket kits I bought for rebuilding my engine had brand new little
plastic bushing spacer thingys.  So don't worry about  'em.  You should get new
ones in the gasket kit you are going to need.  As you can tell, I don't know the
official name for these parts.

&gt; I won't go into why, but i split the 73 1700 case i will be rebuilding into an

&gt; A couple of the little plastic 'spacers' or 'bushings' that are on the big
&gt; case bolts around the cylinder bores were brittle and crumbled when i removed
&gt; them.
&gt;
&gt; Anybody know what these little daddies are officially called and who might
&gt; have em?
