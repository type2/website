Subject: Re: [T2] Finally figured it out???

Sounds right to me. However, from personal experience: if a spring
breaks, the weight starts rubbing on the distributor housing dispersing
lots of fine metal dust all over the distributor. If you are running
points (and not electronic ignition) you will notice that pretty soon
because the dust gets in between the points and you get MAJOR ignition
problems. This is based on experience from a 61 Opel, but these Opels
also use Bosch distributors that are very similar to the VW ones.

Unless there is some sort of provision on the plate the weights are
mounted on to prevent the weights from moving beyond a certain point, I
would thus assume that the broken spring is a rather recent problem.

While we are talking about distributors: I have one with the centrifugal
advance almost seized up (need a pry bar on the shaft with the
distributor in a vise to move it). Plenty of Kroil sprayed all over the
distributor has not help much. Any suggestions on how to free it up?
