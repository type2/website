Subject: Re: [T2] Powder Coat Fuel Tank

This sounds like a question to put to people who do powder-coating. If 
they do it, or have done it, they'll tell you. Be sure to ask them then 
how long they guarantee the coating in that environment.

If they don't do it -- and my guess is that they don't -- they'll give 
you a reason why. I doubt that it's because &quot;nobody thought of this 
before.&quot;
