Thanks for all your suggestions but it was actually easier to fix then I
made it.  It turned out that I just had a bad fuse, when I checked for
broken fuses, I didn't notice it cause it wasn't broken but I caught it
when I tried my dad's volt meter.  Now I'm back on the road and hopefully
going to be at the show at Jordan lake.  Thanks once again,  Dallas:)
