Subject: 2 Liter in a '72 Hightop

Hello,

I'll take this opportunity to join in.

I just bought a nice 72 bus high top with a bad 1700cc engine and made a
deal with the local VW shop to replace it with a used rebuilt 2000cc. Cost
$1300 for the engine and labor. Now I'm learning about Solex carbs and
decided to replace them and remove all the smog with a new Weber 2 barrel
and manifold kit for $400. It ran strong at first but the Solex carbs have
been problematic.

Bus is in really nice shape outside and inside except for water leaks have
rotted all the interior paneling. I'm doing a hack paneling job but it's
coming along. Added a new roof vent.

Also replaced some perfect front seats with 2 plush high back captains seats
from a Chevy van conversion and replaced the interior rear seat and closet
with the interior from an older bus.

I'm halfway decided to use a camping stove and not to have a sink and stove
cabinet to free up space but keep the propane package heater.

Anyway, I'm in the club wit' you all now.

Questions, comments, ideas and howdys welcome.

peace
gary in SF

&gt; find a decent used one, I think I'd actually attempt a rebuild myself
&gt; (gasp!). Though it'd probably take the rest of my natural life to
&gt; complete. I'd love to have a 2.0L in my bus.
