Wow, two in one day.

&gt;At cold idle I am at
&gt;65/70 PSI, as things heat up and I'm zooming down the
&gt;freeway at 60/65 it goes as low as 20PSI.

20 psi is low, no doubt about it.  At slightly less than that pressure I 
experienced loss of lubrication and bearing damage in my engine.  You 
definately need to take action to get the pressure back up at speed.  Any 
of the following may help:

1) Check oil cooler fins for obstructions
2) Check flaps for proper operation
3) Check sealing of engine compartment
4) Make sure ignition timing is not too advanced.
5) Check carb jetting
6) Run synthetic oil
7) Replace oil pump (this one is on my to-do list)

Getting an oil temperature gauge might help you diagnose this problem, and 
is a good thing to have.  Check the archives at type2_dot_com.
