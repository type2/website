Subject: vanagon fresh air flaps

HI list,
	Now that it has got to a chilley 38degF (Heh.. heh) here in
Northern CA, I'm noticing the fresh air from the nose intake more than I
would like.  Is it supposed to be possible to shut off this flow with the
factory controls, or is the standard option to tape over the opening/use a
bra?  Even with all my controls closed/full hot I get cold air either from
the screen vents or, if the top lever is all the way right, from the foot
vents.  I consulted the Bentley and the flaps that close off this vent
appear to be free swinging and not connected to any of the cables.  How
are they intended to operate?  thanks. jon

ps it's a good thing I'm not home in AK
