Subject: vw theft prevention

From a British MG newsgroup I found the following suggestion:

Install a battery cut off switch with a half amp fuse wired in parallel. With 
this the courtesy light will go on and the radio will still play so  
everything seems normal. 

But when the ignition is tried, the fuse will blow and obviously the VW/bus/
car/van/etc. will not start.

Also I once read of running a wire from the coil? to a hidden grounding 
switch in the cab. When the switch is off, everything is normal. But when the 
switch is on, the coil will be grounded....no spark. The engine will still 
turn over like normal, but it will never start.

I think the simpler the better. Alarms are nice but people ignore them. 
Lojack claims to have something like a 95% recovery rate, but I still prefer 
a 100% bus-not-starting rate. When I used to leave my bug at the trailhead 
for multi-day hikes, I would pull the complete radio out, storing it in the 
trunk and leaving the gaping hole in the dash in plain sight. Also I would 
take usually 2 ignition parts with me in my pack and detach a wire before 
leaving the bug. Paranoid.... yes a bit, but the bug was always still 
there when I returned. I am always amazed at the people who leave their 
expensive SUV's at remote trailheads. Some of the trailhead parking spaces 
I've been to are so remote that the car alarm would wear the battery out 
before anyone heard it; and a Lojack in the SUV would be of no use since the 
owner/camper will be hiking for days till he/she knew that the vehicle was 
&quot;permanently borrowed&quot;
