Oh Wise and Knowing Franken-meisters.....

Here in the nearly bus-less west of Kentucky I have run across what may be a
gem. Bear in mind that I haven't actually seen it yet, but it is desribed as
a 1977 Sunroof Passenger bus. No rear seats, rest of interior in good shape,
not a spot of rust anywhere. (We'll see about that.) Glass all present and
in good condition. No motor or transmission or title. (Getting a new title
isn't too tough here.) He also has a 2.0 FI motor available, but I get the
impression it came from a different bus. He has &quot;heard it run&quot; and claims a
new clutch and pressure plate, a new distributor, all new tune-up type
parts, but admits to a bad fuel pump. No documentation or test results. The
price is so low I can't even tell you.

Here we go with the questions:
Is the 2.0 FI motor correct for a 77 bus?
I have a 1.7 carbed long block in the shed; would that fit the 77 engine
compartment?
Will the tin, alternator, etc, from the 2.0 fit on the 1.7 long block?
Is the 77 transmission an NLA, one year only beast, or are they readily
available?
Do I need another bus in my yard?
Do I want another project? I have never dealt with FI before.

OK, OK, you wore me down. The guy wants $50 for the bus or $300 for the
motor and bus. I might go look at it tomorrow.

Opinions, conjectures, wise guidance???

Thanks in advance,
Dave
