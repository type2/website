Subject: Oil pressure switch

I'm sure this is an old story; but, as I understand it, the purpose of the oil
light is to let you know why your engine died... I once had a ' 66  which leaked
a bit and late one night on a lonely country road I went a bit too far before
topping up the oil...The light came on and I immediately shut the engine and
pulled over...No more than two seconds...  Once I got on the shoulder I tried to
turn it over..No way..  I can't remember now what I found when I opened it up.
Either the mains or the rod bearings were shot...But I definitly had to do a
rebuild.

  Actually turned out to be one of the best things that ever happened to me.
Got a tow up to St. Francisville, Louisiana with a couple of good old boys from
Natchez Mississippi.  I spent the next seven months completely overhauling the
van from frame on up with the help and support of a community of right thinking
individuals...
