&gt; &gt; take a screwdriver and short across both brake
&gt; switches it is possible for 
&gt; &gt; one to be bad and they work diferent sides. Your
&gt; tail light works because its 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; I dont believe this is right. the 2 brake switches
&gt; are in parallel either
&gt; switch operates both brake lights and/or warning
&gt; circuit.

Yeah, this sounds right to me, too. I don't know for a
fact one way or another, though (and Muir/Bentley
don't seem to cover it, either).

So...what happens if I *do* ground the two switches
together???? Which of the 3 spade connectors (on each
switch) do I jump to which???? If I follow Muir, he
says to jump (short) each switch seperately, but
*STILL* doesn't say which 2 of the 3 spade connectors
to short!!!!

I *hate* electrical probs....I just don't have a feel
for it ;-(


Thanks for the help!


Jaime
