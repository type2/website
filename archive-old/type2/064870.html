Subject: warming up the engine ...

My husband and I have had a running argument on this subject for years. He
thinks the '82 aircooled Vanagon should sit and &quot;warm up&quot; after being turned
on. I always turn it on and take off immediately, as suggested in the
handbook. (Since it's mine I win anyway. &lt;g&gt;) Any comments?
