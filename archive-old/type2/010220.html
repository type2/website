&gt; Greetings Friendly List Volks*
&gt; 
&gt; Today we are going to try to get Ramona's new (NEW! As in &quot;still in
&gt; the 
&gt; original box&quot;!!) 8track car stereo installed! I am NOT inclined when
&gt; it comes 
&gt; to electrical stuff, so I have a coupla questions for you pro's
&gt; before I 
&gt; start shocking myself.

First of all, do you really want to do this?  The 8-track is probably
15+ years old, and I'll lay heavy odds that it won't work when
installed.  The reason is that devices of this type relied upon rubber
belts to operate their mechanisms, and the rubber deteriorates. 
Chances are that your rubber belts are lying in pieces inside the case.
 It won't hurt to give it a try (the tape won't move), but why go
through the hassle of installing and uninstalling it?

Your best bet is to bench-test the unit.  Hook up the power and
speakers on a bench and pop in a tape.  If it works for a while (say a
couple of hours) then it's OK.  If not, you've saved yourself a hassle.

There are still places about that will fix vintage gear, and the belts
are usually still available.  Sounds like an 8-track will be a way kewl
period accessory!

&gt; All I have is the owner's manual which only briefly tells you how
&gt; to do 
&gt; this. This stereo must have been one of the last models made since it
&gt; has a 
&gt; digital face with clock and channel display for the radio!
&gt; Here's what it says:
&gt; RED LEAD (fused): Connect to &quot;Accessory&quot; terminal of fuse block.

This is a terminal on the fuse block that goes on and off with the
ignition.  The terminal above fuse 10 (counting from left) is good for
this.

&gt; BLUE LEAD: If car is equipped w/ automatic antenna, connect to
&gt; antenna 
&gt; power relay.

You don't have an automatic antenna, so just tape up the end of this
wire and bundle it up neatly.

&gt; YELLOW LEAD: Connecting to vehicle's instrument panel
&gt; illumination 
&gt; circuit will allow you to control the brightness of the radio digital
&gt; display 
&gt; with the instrument panel control. (huh?)

Gawd, this is a complex one!  OK, you have a rheostat that dims the
instrument lights when you rotate the light switch.  A grey wire with a
red stripe connects this switch to the instrument lights.  You need to
tap into this wire somewhere along its length and hook it to the yellow
lead from the stereo.  You might be best off to tap in right at the
headlight switch.

Alternately, you can just hook this lead to the same terminal as you
did the red lead.  Your display will be on full-brightness all the
time.

&gt; BLUE/WHITE STRIPE LEAD: This lead is for the digital clock, and
&gt; MUST be 
&gt; connected to a terminal which will supply 12 volts continuously even
&gt; w/ the 
&gt; ignition switched off. One such terminal is the +positive terminal of
&gt; the car 
&gt; battery. Another source is the &quot;hot&quot; side of the ignition car switch.

This one can go to the terminal above fuse 7 on the fuse block.  This
fuse is &quot;hot&quot; all the time.  You don't have to go all the way to the
battery.

Many folks simply connect the red power wire to terminal 7 and let it
go at that.  This way you can play the radio when the ignition is off. 
This does _not_ work where the radio's display is on when the radio is
off (showing the time or whatever), as this will drain the battery.  In
your case, it appears that the display power is taken from the
instrument light switch, so you might get away with this.

&gt; GROUND: Yayyyy! THIS one, I understand! Sad, yes?

You didn't mention the speaker wires.  I assume that you know how these
go.

&gt; Basically, I don't even know where to connect. The ends of all of
&gt; these 
&gt; wires are bare, no push-on's or anything, except the power lead which
&gt; is 
&gt; push-on. Do these literally go into the same space in the fuse block
&gt; as the 
&gt; wires that are already there?? They share the same hole?

You'll have to put male push-on terminals on all the wires, except the
ground wire which should get a ring terminal.  Instructions on how to
install these terminals properly is found in the electrical section of
the type 2 library at http://www.type2_dot_com

In most cases, you'll find a spare terminal for each connection on the
fuse block.  If you need to hook up to a fuse that doesn't have a spare
terminal open, you can get a &quot;piggyback&quot; terminal adapter at your
FLAPS.  This allows two wires to hook to one terminal.

Don't scrimp on doing a good installation.  Any fault in the wiring
caused by sloppy workmanship will waste far more time to fix than
simply doing it right in the first place.  Don't trust the &quot;pros&quot; to do
it right either.  I've had to completely redo &quot;pro&quot; jobs less than a
year old, because they only care if the system works when you drive the
car out of their shop.  This work isn't rocket science, and it's good
practice for more complicated electrical work that you may do later on.
Get a good Weller soldering gun (they last forever) and good solder (I
like Kester brand).  Use heat-shrink tubing on the connections as
instructed in the type2_dot_com article and everything will look neat,
clean, and spiffy!

&gt; really appreciate any help you can offer. The last perm I had was
&gt; about 20 
&gt; years ago, and I did NOT like looking like Little Orphan Annie!!!

Funny, the last one I had made me look like Wierd Al Yankovic... :)
