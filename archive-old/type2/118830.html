Subject: for left over paints

To keep left over paints and stuff from skinning over and drying up in
the can I do 1 of 2 things.
    1.  Don't open the top of the can.  To get out the contents I
punch a small hole in the top and then close it with a sheet metal
screw.

                                                    OR

    2.  If the top has been opened, and after some of the contents
have been poured out, put in enough clean rocks to bring the top of
the liquad to the top of the can.  Then carefully reinstall the lid.
The idea is to displace as much of the air as possible from the can.
