Subject: trip planning

I am getting ready to start planning my big road trip
for next spring/summer for me and 2 or three friends.
I am planning a major overhaul of the bus for this
winter to get it worthy. I am planning on starting
from denver and heading west pretty much. I am
definitly going through utah, idaho, washington,
oregon, maybe california, definately arizona, new
mexico, and probably nevada. Do people have any
suggstions for this area that are off the beaten path?
I am planning on departing in late march just in case
next year is as hot as this year, and probably coming
back in late july or early august( obviously we are in
no hurry at all) and if we run out of stuff to see we
may head east or more likely to vancouver and some of
brithish columbia. I have never really explored
arizona or nevada, or southern californa and am really
looking for ideas there. After this trip I will head
to the mountains and have a cool winter as a ski bum
that I mentioned a few days ago. Any suggestions would
be great.
Later,
Tyler
