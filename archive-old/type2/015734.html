Chris,

Except for the possibly of a gas heater being installed, you can have
adequate heat in your bus using just the heat exchangers.  The heat will
never be as good as a Type III, Ghia, or Bug, as the volume of air to be
heated is significantly greater.

There are a couple of things that you MUST do to get heat:

#1 Ensure that your heat exchangers are in good working order.

#2 Ensure that the entire system is well sealed.  That means a number of
things.

a.  In the case of a type I engine that the hoses from the fan housing to
the heat exchangers are good and well sealed at both ends. For the type IV
engine, ensure that the space where the fan housing meets the heat
exchangers are covered.

b.  Follow the entire system from the heat exchangers forward, and check
for leaks/gaps in the tubes.

c.  Check the flappers (for T1 on the exchangers themselves, on T4 at the
ends of the bellows) ensure that when you pull the levers that they
actually open.  If not then the cables are broken, you can then use ZIP
ties, or similar to &quot;wire&quot; the flappers open until you replace the cables.

d.  Assuming all of the above to be in good working order, and you still do
not get heat, start taking things apart, and check for blockage.

These steps will ensure that the system is in good working order. You
should now be getting air flow.  It may not necessarily be warm, however.
In that case you should do something to insulate the tube that runs from
the &quot;Y&quot; junction just forward of the bellows tubes, to the front.  That
will do wonders to increase the temperature of the air rushing forward.

When this is complete, and you still do not have adequate heat, then you
may want to consider the addition of supplementary heating equipment, in
the form of gas, or propane heaters, many of which can be acquired through
contacts on the list, either directly, or by referral.

I did the above steps(minus the addition of a gas/propane heater) and I get
enough heat to survive a Texas winter.  In fact last winter I had to keep
the windows cracked to let some heat out, as I was plenty warm.  It has not
gotten cold enough yet to even justify turning on the heat.

This should help.

Cheers,

David
