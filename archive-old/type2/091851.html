Subject: I smell like exhaust fumes

--part1_34.2d64d962.2ab3d6dd_boundary

Hello all- I have a 69 bus. I had my muffler replaced recently and the 
mechanic told me that he didn't have the right clamp to go between the 
muffler and the heat exchange. He used epoxy to seal it, which broke loose. I 
had a couple exhaust free days, but now am back to having excessive fumes in 
the vehicle. Can anyone tell me how to find this &quot;special clamp&quot; or how to 
have one fabricated? The mechanic says to his knowledge there is no 
substitute for the clamp, and it is specific to 68-72 Buses. Fall is coming 
and I will have to ride with my windows up... not sure I can do that without 
asphyxiating myself. Thanks! Tammy in Pittsburgh.
