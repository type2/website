Subject: Re: [T2] turning over engine in car w/o starter

Hi Paul,

With a standard transmission you can turn the motor with the rear 
wheels. The other way to do it is to use the alternator -- if the belt 
is at the correct tension it should turn the fan and crank easily, even 
with the spark plugs in.

Happy trails,

&gt; what does everyone use to turn the motor over in the car.  looking at 
&gt; the
&gt; fan it looks like a special tool would fit in the hole but i don't have
&gt; that tool.
