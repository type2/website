Subject: Re: type2 Digest 30 Sep 2001 00:53:06 -0000 Issue 267

A bus brother confirmed opinion of several others when he wrote:

&gt; ...I also used Vanagon seatbelts mounted on the floor with L-brackets.
&gt; They still plenty long when mounted in this fashion...

So I wrote:

OK, that's it! I've been driving my '78 Westy with a pair of slightly too
short Audi (?) reatractable belts on homemade L-brackets for years now.
Now I'm officially shopping for a set of uncrashed Vanagon seatbelts to
stick in Westy.

Does anyone out there have a pair of these, including the receivers?
P-mail me and name your price. I'm looking for Vanagon seats too, but I'll
have to get those very locally (Santa Barbara, CA) as they are too big and
heavy to ship cost effectively.
