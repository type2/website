Subject: Color of bus.

I have a '77 westy that is white, actually it is an off white.  Does anyone
know what color number this is so I can get some touchup paint.  Maybe someone
knows where the number is posted on my bus?  I am sure it is highly faded so
I am not real concerned with having an exact match just better than spray paint
white?  This bus will never be a show winner.

One more questions.  How does engine installation compare to engine removal
as far as level of difficulty and time involved.  I am almost to this point.
I can't believe the day is almost here.
Thanks for your help,
Brett Thorsland
