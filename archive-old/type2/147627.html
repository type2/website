&gt; I have a 78 california westfalia that has long since been stripped of

Bob, the lack of a crossover pipe or a cat will have no effect on the 
ECU. I believe that the O2 sensor did not come along until 1979 (Karl 
will correct me if I am wrong), so it may have been a retrofit for 
testing. Do you have a harness wire that goes to the sensor?
