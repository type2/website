&gt; Doesn't that mean that he switches his highbeams on into the face of an oncoming

Sorry for the confusion. When being passed, signaling w/ high beams 
tells the truck he isn't clear of your vehicle yet... and is also a 
signal to warn him you are passing. When he is clear, you can briefly 
turn off your headlights to signal he's clear. 

Another signal, not used much any more, is to blink out your lights to 
oncoming trucks when there's trouble ahead... usually in the form of a 
trouper sitting in wait.
