Subject: In defense of POR-15
Message-ID: &lt;Pine.LNX.4.21.0105050922010.5611-100000_at_westfailure_dot_net&gt;

Hello,

I read a post here the other day saying por15 was no good from an
expert on painting truck frames, and I wanted to interject an opposing
opinion.

I am not an expert on painting truck frames, however, I do have over 100k
rusty-bus miles under my belt. (never owned one without rust..)

I drive my 71 bus year round. Salt, rain snow and mud hit it
regularly. Wherever I painted the rust with POR15 it has stopped, dead in
its tracks.  Wherever I didn't paint POR15 it has continued to rust.

Sure, its probably technically better to sandblast, metal etc, prime
etc. etc. but Por15 is perfect for stopping those small to medium sized
rust patches on your cargo floor that another poster spoke of. I have done
that plenty of times and am perfectly satisfied.  The oldest of these
&quot;stopgap&quot; solutions is 4-5 years old and still keeps the rust at bay.

I tend not to trust experts giving opinions on products they have no
personal experience with. Sometimes knowledge can handicap you, as you
decide you know everything and become unwilling to experiment with new
ideas and products. I have tried most other rust preps, and like the
expert, found them lacking. However, I kept an open mind, tried this one,
and found it to be a good one. But dont take my word for it, paint a rusty
piece of plate steel and stick it in a pan of saltwater, see what
happens. Put a piece in there plated with etching primer, scratch both of
em to bare metal in a couple of spots... i'm curious to know what happens
too.

But, your mileage may vary, and follow the directions on the can, I have
had one application not go so well because I put it on too thick and didnt
clean the metal first as suggested.

Take Care,

Steve

P.S. I have no affilitaion with any company mentioned here, I pay my own
bills and am giving my opinion for free... about what its worth.
