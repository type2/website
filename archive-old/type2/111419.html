Subject: Re: [T2] re popping out of gear

sounds like the sequencers are going out .., when they finally go the tranny will have to be completely rebuilt.,
if they go out youll not find a gear at all..,,.
mine started in high gear and then went down the gears a little at a time.,.., when tranny finally went out i had a little of 1st and reverse,.,,.
nothing else.,,
was awful,,,
not saying this is your problem but popping out of gear like that can be caused can be i said caused by the sequencers going bad.,,.
hope this helps some?&gt;
peace

&gt;My 70 Bus has started very infrequently popping out of gear in fourth. Usually
&gt;it's when I'm going slowly, I can drive hundreds of miles with no problem, but
&gt;sometimes going slowly it'll pop. I have a new coupler and other plans for the
&gt;trans, like new seals. Any ideas on the popping out? With the trans out, how
&gt;hard would it be to replace the associated parts?
