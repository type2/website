Subject: VW-DOGHOUSE OIL COOLER LOCATION-WHY DOES THIS WORK AT ALL?

As Rickey used to say to Lucy, &quot;Splan someting to me...&quot; I'v got the fan
housing for my '71 Type II in my hands and for the life of me I can't
figure what the good engineers in Wolfsburg were thinking when they
shifted the oil cooler out of the original position *inside* the housing
and into a nearly hermetically sealed box.  Before, the little skyscraper
was subject to a full blast of cool fresh air from the fan parked next
door.  I understand perfectly that the head on the left side,
specificially cylinder #3, suffered from this arrgangement since some of
the air flow was blocked and moreover, the air that did reach the head had
been heated by the radiation coming from the oil cooler.  Bright idea:
move it out from inside of the housing so the heads are cooled equally by
creating the separate doghouse.

Only problem is that for the first time in my life, I've taken a few
minutes to study the sheet metal arrangement of the doghouse.  I had
always assumed that the air flow from the fan hit the now-moved oil cooler
pretty much unimpeded and then the warmed air exited out that little scoop
that faces forward in the front tin.  Well, it seems that there is only a
*tiny* duct for blown air to actually enter the completely separated
doghouse.  Very little of the fan's air flow could possibly reach the oil
cooler and certainly there would be a huge reduction of the amount of cool
air it receives as compared to the older in-the-housing set-up.  There
would also be the potential for no air to enter the doghouse if at high
speeds there would be a opposing flow of air into the doghouse exhaust
scoop (which faces forward on my Bus).  Even worse, the cooler is
completely shut off from the outside (except for the little scoop) and
without a consistent air flow, the cooler would bake inside its little
sheet metal tomb.  Indeed, we are told that a Bus engine will overheat if
you don't have that little piece of tin that fits on the *bottom-front*
of the doghouse but if you have that on, the oil cooler would be completely
cut off from the outside world (I have *never* seen an engine with this
piece; indeed, the only picture I've ever seen of it is in the Gene Berg
catalog and even they say the part is no longer available).

Tell me why I'm wrong.  Tell me why an external oil cooler set-up, even
one inside the Bus' engine comparment but mounted on the left-side up
towards the exterior air intake half-moon, wouldn't give the poor oil a
better chance to radiate its heat than a doghouse that for all intents and
purposes, appears to allow only a trickle of fan air inside a tiny
enclosure.

Inquiring minds would like to know.
