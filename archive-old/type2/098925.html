Subject: Dealer Price List

I went to the VW dealer to get a part and the guy at the counter is finally starting to get into the routine...

At first he wouldn't look up parts for me because I had a 78 model, then he started looking up parts if I gave him the numbers but often he would have to refund me because the part was unavailable even though the computer matched the number with a description.

Now he confirms that the part is still available before ordering anything by looking up the number in a phone book sized tome with all the part numbers in it.  It was called Dealer Price List, June 2002.

Does anyone have this or know where to order it from? I imagine it's a dealer only thing but it would be so handy to have and save me some time. He offered to give it to me when it's replaced but he doesn't know when that will be (maybe Dec?) and I'm sure he will throw it out before he remembers the promise he made.
