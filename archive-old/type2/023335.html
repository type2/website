Oooh! I like this!!!

I've been looking at using the 18&quot; x 18&quot; oil cooler and fan that I have 
from my Type IV powered Beetle to use as a heater on cold trips in the bus. 
I would take 25 minutes or longer to get to temp but I think I could 
theoretically put out heat in the 80+ F range which is much better than out 
heat pump in our house... Just run an electric thermostat that locks out 
the fan until the cooler is up to temp or will cut out the fan if the temps 
drop too far in the cooler.

The water to oil cooler idea is better because the heat transfer would be 
better and it would be easy to plumb up a pair of  water radiators on the 
van - one exterior for warm weather oil cooling and one inside for heat. 
Select using a ball valve. The leaks would be easier to detect and easier 
to clean up than oil I bet too.

I LIKE IT.

You first... &lt;grin&gt;

Take it one step further. A water heater (using propane) and the bilge pump 
to circulate the water and a fan to blow air through the inside heater core 
for parked heat. Man now there is a really terrible idea - two electric 
motors AND propane to do the same work that a radiant heater would do... 
Never mind.



&gt;Ok, David and collective, here's my thinking on why a water cooled oil
&gt;cooler might be a good idea.  First, while I agree that it would not help to
&gt;raise the oil to temp on start up, that isn't really the problem our engines
&gt;have anyhow.  Our problem is that when you head up the hill or drive with
&gt;your full complement of camping gear, or even just across the flatlands on a
&gt;hot day, that oil temp shoots up there.
&gt;
&gt;And to cool it with a normal air cooler, you have a dilemma  between keeping
&gt;the small diameter oil lines short so the pressure doesn't drop, even though
&gt;there is nowhere good near the engine to hang the cooler, or running long
&gt;lines to the middle or front of the bus where there is a little more room
&gt;and air, but trading that for a pressure drop.  Also, air is just not nearly
&gt;as good a conductor of heat as water, so you need a relatively large surface
&gt;to cool with air.
&gt;
&gt;I'm thinking that because the water is more efficient at soaking up heat,
&gt;you could have a smaller cooler near the engine where there is room for it,
&gt;and where the oil doesn't have to travel far, and then the  water
&gt;circulation could go through big 3/4 or 1 inch tubes pumped by an
&gt;inexpensive bilge pump, basically eliminating any flow restrictions.
&gt;You could control the temperature either by putting a mechanical thermostat
&gt;in the oil line, as is done with a normal oil cooler, and/or by  putting a
&gt;thermostatic switch on the water circulation pump.  Simple!
