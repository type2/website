just as an aside here,

i put NEW rear drums on my 71 (dont buy mexican drums unless you have to,
one was out of round from the factory but i didnt figure this out until
too late)

i left the hubcaps off and had to pull a drum less than 6 months later and
it was already frozen on a bit!  I spread a very thin coating of
anti-sieze on the hub to drum mating surface and have run with hubcaps
since.  Every time i need to take a drum off it pops right off :)

after giving this situation some thought i realized that without hubcaps
water can easily get to the drum/hub interface thus causing corrosion.
With the hubcap on ther is no way for water to get to this joint, thus
preventing corrosion from all but humidity. 

so, the hubcaps on your bus serve a mechanical purpose, not just a
decorative one.  Keepem on there :)

peas,

Steve
