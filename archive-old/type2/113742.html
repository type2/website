Subject: Re: [T2] Re:liquid repair for loose ball joints?

&gt;While on the subject fo liquid thread replacement, does anyone know if
&gt;they still sell that worn ball joint tightener that was squirted into
&gt;the gap between ball and socket and set to a self lubricating layer that
&gt;reduced play to zero?  Back in the 70's it was called Liqui-Seal or
&gt;such?

Can't believe there is something like that out there. NO WAY - not me!!! 
You're joking - right?

Seriously - if you're not joking - you really need to just replace any 
faulty brake, steering, or suspension part.

When those fail you get killed or worse - I get killed because you made a 
poor decision.

If a ball join fails you loose steering - bad. You loose suspension and 
traction - really bad too.

I imagine a Westy doing a barrel roll at 65 mph like one I heard of 
recently in Tazwell, TN - it failed the moose test.

Would be interesting to know if crummy tires contributed to the accident.
