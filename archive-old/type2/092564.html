When I said &quot;capacity&quot;, that's what I meant.

&gt;You drop the fuel pressure by adding gaskets between the pump and spacer,
&gt;until you are at 3.5psi. Interestingly enough, many of the aftermarket pump
&gt;spacers (the bakelite piece) are THINNER then the originals, which when
&gt;installed instantly kicks your fuel pressure over the threshold of &quot;properly
&gt;operating pressure&quot;. Another instance of an aftermarket part creating
&gt;problems if you aren't paying attention.

I WAS paying attention.  I used the original fuel pump spacer with my new 
brazilian pump which, if the part was really a &quot;replacement&quot; pump as 
advertised, should have resulted in the proper pressure.  The pump was 
obviously not designed to the specs of the original pump, and to me that 
makes it a piece of crap.  The fact that it also leaked gas *and* oil just 
reinforced my opinion.  After installing it I brought the pressure down 
with an external regulator (did I mention I was paying attention?) but the 
pump still failed after a measly 30k miles, approximately.  If you want a 
quality fuel pump, don't bother with this Brazilian pump from the Bus Depot 
- it's a waste of $40.

p.s. This is not meant as a flame to Bus Depot.  I'm sure they weren't 
aware of the low quality of this pump and I appreciate them at least 
selling parts that will fit my bus.
