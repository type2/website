&gt; Thanks to everyone who had words of advice on my sheared off studs. 
I think
&gt; I can get the better of that problem.
&gt; 
&gt; Now, I sheared those studs off to get the heat boxes off.  They are
both
&gt; moderately rusted away.  I know I SHOULD replace them (and cry once,
&gt; celebrate every time it snows), but... anyone have a good trick that
holds
&gt; up for resealing the rusty gap between the sheet metal and the
in/out spots
&gt; of the exhaust  pipe?  The valves are fine, only one other hole.  Is
it too
&gt; hot for that rust stabilizing paint to keep up?

If the basic metal of the boxes is in good shape, then you might want
to try this repair:

From 16ga or so metal strip 3/4 inch wide, make four semicircles
molded to the OD of the exhaust pipe.  Slide these into place where
the pipe goes into the heater box.  Braze the pieces to the heater
box.  Add whatever pieces of metal you need to keep the semicircles
secure.

The wider bearing area of the strips make this repair last longer than
the original metal.

For basic holes in the box, make a patch from 16ga sheet steel that is
larger than the hole.  Mold the patch to the shape of the exchanger,
then braze it into place.

Unless you can score some OEM heat exchangers, patching your old ones
is the best way to go.  Aftermarket exchangers are usually ligher and
less durable.
