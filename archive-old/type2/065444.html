Subject: Drivers Manual Splitty Propaganda

While waiting in the courthouse this afternoon, I picked up a copy of
the Iowa Drivers Manual to pass the time. On page 96 between the Bad
Weather Driving Tips and Night driving section is a photo of a Westfalia
Splitty sitting on the side of the road. The bright lights of another
car are blinding the other half of the photo. The bus looks like it is
in very good shape. Broken down? I don't know - but the caption under
the photo says &quot;Night driving creates its own special problems.
Headlight glare masks the position and number of oncoming vehicles.&quot; I
don't know if this picture means to put Splitties in a bad light (pun
intended) but it is an unusual photo for the Iowa Manual - other than at
VW shows I've only seen one splitty on the road in the past year...
