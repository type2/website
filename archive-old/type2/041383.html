I pulled out all the tumblers on my old '74 superbeetle for cleaning a long
time ago.  One of the locks was chewed up by a would be thief without a coat
hanger.  I pulled apart another vw lock and inserted my old tumber into it
and voila, a fixed lock.

You could go to a boneyard and look for a bus with keys, pull the locks and
replace your own.

&gt; Subject: bus key problem--please read
&gt; 
&gt; hi, I got my bus(71 westy) around christmas time and the PO
&gt; gave me the most worn out key i have seen in a while.  I was wondering
&gt; why he didnt get a new one until today when i took my key and car to the
&gt; locksmith and he said my existing key cannot be copied and that a new
&gt; key cannot be made from my door lock.  I then tried to go to the dealer
&gt; to find a key code but they dont have it. The locksmith told me that
&gt; there is  nothing i can do except change the 5 locks operated by
&gt; my old key.  My brother has an 86 scirocco and he modified his door lock
&gt; to accomodate a different key.  He filed down the brass tumblers that
&gt; prevent/allow the key to turn and that worked.  my questions---do the
&gt; door locks on the busses
&gt; disassemble enogh to expose the tumblers? does anyone know another
&gt; solution to my problem? does anyone have a parts bus with all good
&gt; handles/locks/keys.
&gt; Thank you for reading--Brian--71 westy
