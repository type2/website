Subject: needed: seat cover

Hello all,
I ordered my new front bottom seat cushions from WCM the other day, so I
will ask about this one time:  does anyone out there have a seat cover
from a '78 or so bus, in brown, that they want to sell?  Specifically, I
am looking for ONLY the driver's side (tho the pass. side is the same)
bottom seat cover, not the seat back cover.  Anybody?

Thanks,
Sean
