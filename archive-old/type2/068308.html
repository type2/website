Subject: flickering generator light

Hi again. The past couple of days I have had a mysterious problem: My
generator light flickers when I am driving. The funny thing is that it does
not flicker when I am at idle, or when I rev the engine in neutral.
However, it starts to flicker in 2nd or 3rd gear, then persists until I am
again at idle. The flickering doesn't go away when I am coasting down a
hill in 4th gear, either. I have a '72 beetle engine with a generator. The
generator belt seems to be properly adjusted, so I'm not sure what's going
on. The lights and radio do not seem to have an effect on this phenomenon.
What could it be? Should I worry?

Speaking of radios, I had a pair of big old JBL speakers sitting in my
garage collecting dust, while at the same time I had crappy little speakers
in my bus. &quot;Hey!&quot; I said to myself. &quot;Why don't I see if the JBL speakers
fit in the bus?&quot; I laid them on their backs on the top of the engine
compartment, with a piece of 2&quot;x4&quot; underneath the rearmost part of the
speakers to tilt them slightly toward the front. All I can say is WOW. No
more engine noise ;). Now I'm ready to compete with the low-rider pickup
trucks in the loudest stereo contest (he he he he). Actually, they sound
really good. The wood interior gives the bus good acoustics, I guess.
There's even enough room left for my tool box.

Thanks,

P. S. To all those following my attempt to paint the bus with marine paint,
I have bought the paint. 1 gallon gloss white, 1 quart racing red from
Sears. About 50 bucks total. I hope to have it painted by Christmas. I'll
let everyone know how it turns out.
