Subject: Re: [T2] Dynamat &amp; POR15

&gt; After this is all done though, I would like to put a few strips of
&gt; Dynamat or similar product down on the floor as well.  Does anyone know if
&gt; this would cause a problem.  I have not played with Dynamat yet or POR15
and
&gt; am not sure if there will be an adhesion issue.
&gt;     I've contacted Dynamat but they have to info in regards to
&gt; applications in this manner.
&gt;
&gt; Have a good weekend...
&gt;
   Didn't / wasn't that whole photo essay on &quot;Heating and Soundproofing
Your VW&quot;, which included installing Dynamat as well as other products
to insulate a VW bus, later followed by some photos of the said Bus
returned to a rather rusted condition... ?-(
