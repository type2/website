I have found that the Sikkens epoxy primer, when sprayed over completed
body panels, will provide 100% rust protection for many months.  Assuming
the completed panel is prepped properly.
The primer is deathly toxic (isocyantes) but with all necessary
precautions taken, this stuff is the cats meow.  Sticker shock will
eventually fade for most folks.
I know there are other epoxies out there, but am not familiar with them.
