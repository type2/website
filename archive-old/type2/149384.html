Subject: Re: [T2] help 72 bus - no power

My '76 had a problem that I could not get it over 35-40 MPH.  It was running 
on only two plugs!!!

Could it be that in your 'tune up' and subsequent vibrations that the 
electrical connection to one of the two cuttoff vlaves came off??  On my 
'72, when the electrical connection to my idle cuttoff fell off, I could not 
keep it in idle at all.

Don't mess with the wires; try to find the problem, not just fix the 
problem.  Clip a voltmeter to the cutoff solenoids whle everything is still 
attached and see what you get on these two cutoff solenoids.  If one reads 
12V and the other 0V, you are on your way to the answer, and thereby the 
solution.
