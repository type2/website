Subject: Re: [T2] Adding gages

&lt;You can also mount them between the radio DIN and the ashtray.  I believe Bus Boys
sells a 3 gauge panel for this area as well.  You'll have to use a hole saw
to cut the dash however.&gt; 

I added the gauages to the dash between the radio and ashtray. No parts necessary... Think long and hard about whether you want to cut the dash. Also measure about 7 times because mistakes show up really well. finally spend the extra cash and get a GOOD hole saw (aka DeWalt or Milwaukee). It killed 2-3 Black and Decker saws. I would have been cash ahead with the better hole saw with a tool I could have used again later.
