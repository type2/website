Subject: [T2] Bus to Fiero engine?

Hey.  I just wonder if anyone has ever thought of putting a Pontiac
fiero engine and trans in their bus.  I'd like to know if it could be
done.  Just for my own personal enjoyment.

    Thanks.

Plans to buy another bus are on hold, until next summer
when I will somehow have enough money to go to CA and buy one.
