&gt; Has anyone found any **good** window felt channel replacement?
&gt; 
&gt; The ones that I bought 2 years ago have lost their color on the outside
&gt; and just look grey now.
&gt; 
&gt; This is on my 78 Champagne edition which has been washed maybe 12 times in
&gt; the last two years and has sat in the sun for maybe 20 days in the last 2
&gt; years.
&gt; 
&gt; Did the originals not do better than that?  They don't look frayed or
&gt; anything quite yet, but look like they have aged quite badly on the
&gt; outside.

I have some from Wolfsburg West but it's still in the box because the
original is still doing so well.
