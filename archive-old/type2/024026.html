	Hello list. I have a 1970 Westy with a Brazilian 1600 DP motor in
it. I pulled the motor yesterday afternoon to replace the firewall seal and
some other stuff. I have both Bentley and Muir. From reading these, I
deduced that my engine pull differerd from an original 70 because my motor
has the dog house oil cooler. This meant that only one of the top nuts
removed from inside the engine compartment, the one which holds the starter
on the upper right (fif). The other upper mount, on the left side, because
of the dog house, is removed from under the bus. It is located right behind
the clutch lever. On my bus, there was no clearance around the bolt to get a
socket on. Part of the bell housing casting was in the way, very close to
the bolt head. I tried a wrench, but there is no room to move it once on. I
sat and scratched my head for a while, then went down to the FLAPS to get a
17mm &quot;crows foot&quot; wrench. This did the trick, just barely.
	Did I have so much difficulty because the bell housing is for the
original engine? I was thinking of using an allen head bolt when I put the
engine back in. Would this be O.K. Also, the tin around my spark plugs
looked hacked up. I think that the P.O. used the original single port tin on
this dual port motor. Are there two different styles? Thanks in advance for
your kind advice.

Jeff
