Subject: Does Eurorace still exist?

Does anyone also know if Eurorace, European Racing, or some other names that
now escape me who did T4 performance stuff, 924 heads, sold a lot of carbs,
still exist.

Were in Redondo Beach CA, Unfortunately the only old add I can find has no
phone # and information isn't helpful.
