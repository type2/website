Subject: Re: [T2] 73 bus smog pump

Hi Jen,

Remove the entire system from your bus. It didn't take me but a few
minutes to pull the entire thing off and plug the ports.

 smog pump was disconnected when I bought this
 bus (belt not going from pulley on crank to pulley
 on pump)...  I got a closer look at the engine today,
 and I am wondering if performance would be
 increased if I put a belt on the pulleys and ran
 the smog pump....

Or, would it be better to plug all of the vaccum
 lines that lead to the pump?
