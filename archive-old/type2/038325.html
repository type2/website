Don't do it!  Nothing you put into your crankcase will improve upon the
oil that is already there.  The oil has been carefully designed to do its
job and adding some unknown (to the lubricant chemist) substance to the
crankcase will not do anything good.

Any product that claims to remove dirt from the engine must put that dirt
in suspension in the oil.  do you really want years of built-up grunge
suddenly released all at once in your VW engine?  If the dirt
is stuck to the inside of the engine it won't hurt a thing, but in your
bearings it will do very bad things.

On a related note, I heard on the radio today that the king of the Snake
Oils, Slick 50, is now owned by Pennzoil.  This takes Pennzoil down
several steps on my respect scale.  The subject of the report is that
DuPont is sueing Slick 50 (again) for fraudulent use of the
&quot;DuPont&quot; and &quot;Teflon&quot; names.  Seems that Dupont OK'd the use of their name
in association with Blue Coral car wax (also Pennzoil owned) and Pennzoil
took that to be a blanket approval for any of their products.
