&gt; What year is this?

I couldn't connect to the site, and others have stated it's
a '70.  However: that doesn't mean the brochure is a '70
too!  Frequently images were re-used from previous years,
sometimes with retouching, sometimes without it, in VW
brochures.  For instance, the '68 brochure on bulli_dot_org
even shose one shot of a double door Splitty panel van:

http://www.bulli_dot_org/t2ig/archive/brochure/6708-1/page2223.html

Look at the front wheel arc and door af the vehicle
pictured on the right.

Mid-'70s brochures also feature two pages with plenty of
special vehicles, such as refrigerator vans, ambulances
etc., which are all '72 model year even in later
brochures, presumably because it didn't seem worthwhile 
to photograph all the vehicles again.  And IIRC the
'72 brochure itself is completely retouched from the
'71.

So I'll assume, without having seen it, that your 
brochure is a '72 with a couple of leftover '70 pictures.

Airhowlingly yours,
    Erik.
