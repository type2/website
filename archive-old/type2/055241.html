&gt;I hope this is not too dumb.  Where do you all store your wood when

&gt;camping?  Do you take it with you or buy it somewhere along the way?  I
&gt;thought I heard somebody putting it in their luggage rack.  Thanks for 
&gt;any

=======================&gt;
Well, I'll tell you what we do.
First off, we don't burn wood very often, and we are always bothered by 
how often we find very nice campsites that have been scavenged and 
grubbed clean of underbrush by others, so we decided......
To carry boxes of &quot;firelogs&quot; for our campfires.
Advantages:
Easy to start.
You can pull into your campsite at dark, and have a fire quite fast.
Easy to pack and store in the bus.
These &quot;firelogs&quot; leave very little ash or debris behind.
They don't pop with sparks to endanger dry surroundings.
You can fall asleep to a fire without worrying about burning yourself up.
And you know those times when &quot;open&quot; campfires are forbidden? Well 
simply light a small &quot;firelog&quot; in one of those cheapy BBQ grills and 
you have an &quot;enclosed&quot; fire with no sparks or endangerment to the dry 
forests around your campsite, as in here like we did at Big Bend a few 
years ago.  http://freeweb.pdq_dot_net/perring/images/25.jpg
