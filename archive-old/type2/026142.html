Dave's tip of the day:
There are a couple of small holes in the sheet metal above and forward of
the buckle mounting point (don't know what they were for originally).  I
threaded a small cable tie through these and around the buckle 'stalk'.
Holds it in just the right place, no more groping around in the dirt.

&gt; would be nice
&gt; if the buckle end could be made to stay near the edge of the seat
&gt; instead of lying on the floor.  But as I said, you get used to it.
