Subject: Re: [T2] Westy Luggage Rack Seal

&gt;&gt;I replaced the 2 poptop seals on my '79 Westy last year, and was thinking 
about replacing the luggage rack seal as well.  However, when I removed the 
4 screws on the outside (2 in front, 1 on each side), the luggage rack still 
seemed to be held in place by something underneath it.

Do I need to remove the headliner to gain access to the underside of the 
luggage rack?&lt;&lt;

only partially. standing behind the front seats &amp; facing the front
of the bus, get underneath the solid headliner &amp; there will be a couple
of nuts in there for you to remove.

did this over 2 years ago, so memory is a little hazy.

good luck,

Joel
