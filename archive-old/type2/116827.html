Subject: Disk Brakes Woes, Please Help...

Listees...

I had my brake booster rebuilt by H &amp; R Auto Parts Rebuilders of Dallas TX 
and now when I brake the idle increases....brake power is reduced. Is the 
booster going out again? I checked for leaks in the hoses and they all seem 
good. This is on my 71 Westy that I have a sale pending on.

TIA!!!
