John,
One good thing your 72 does have that a 73 doesn't is a removable rear apron.
That makes a big difference in engine swaps.

However, if you decide you want to cut out the hole on top and weld in a
replacement.  I now have (read my recent post 73 into 78) an extra engine lid
out of a 73 you can have.  Just pick it up.  I'm in Charleston, SC.

Peace Brother and good luck.
Snoopy
