I sandblasted the lower edge of my 71 Westy windshield &quot;frame&quot;, and was
dismayed at all the pits and small (1-2mm) holes there.  The worst spot is a
rusty run of the holes blending together for a slot maybe 5/8&quot; long.  I've
zinc primed it all to hold the fort, but...

I'd say there are maybe 40 holes total, lots of surface pitting most of the
way across.  The vertical flange behind the sill is fine.  The overall ledge
is worth keeping.  Short of having somebody weld over the holes, is there a
recommended patch for this, aside from the old Bondo treatment?

Thanks much.
