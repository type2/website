Subject: Re: [T2] re: Flywheel won't budge

dont know  why you would get a flame.  that is actually recommended in 
several manuals. i usually do a pattern of a couple  three oclock and 
then a couple  nine oclocks  and then twelve  and  six  a couple times. 
  just  dont try to pry it off in big steps.

&gt; [...]I may catch a flame or two from this but I use two large 
&gt; screwdrivers and pry carefully alternating  pressure behind the 
&gt; flywheel till it slips off the  dowels, has not failed yet to get a 
&gt; flywheel off the crank. Phil
