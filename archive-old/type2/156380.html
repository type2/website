Subject: rear seat belt bolt size

Y'all,

I've been throwing all manner of M10/M12 x 1.25/1.5/1.75 bolts at my rear seat
belt mounting holes to no avail, then I came across this in the archives:

&gt;Are you sure they are 11mm??
&gt;I know seat belt bolts are 7/16&quot; fine thread on all cars. Perhaps this size
&gt;would work?

What the hey? The King's threads in my VW?  Is is true?
