&gt;&quot; shoot more oil in cuzthere was none. and new points. of course all for free.&quot;

I'm wondering if you checked your driveway or your oil since the
repair... 

&gt;I was feeling pretty ripped. untill I got a message on
&gt;my answer mach. that the second payment (the first was $1000 the second
&gt;was 1,432.86) bounced like a rubber ball!! 

Now Dave feels ripped...BTW, it doesn't take a genius to determine that
your Amazon_dot_com email address means you probably live in Seattle and
&gt;from there, it doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out who John
is. The VW community is pretty small here...

&gt;whoo hoo! Karma of the VW gottta love it. 

VW Kharma has nothing to do with bouncing checks...It has to do with
giving.

&gt;Can he sue me?

Yep...and he will win. And since we have a &quot;triple damage&quot; penalty here,
if you don't make the check good, the remainder of your repair bill just
went up to $4298.58.

&gt;so I ran...

Says it all.

 
&gt;So on thur. we are gonna sit down and I'm gonna learn about this motor I have, buy tools, replace the pushrod tube seals+the valve cover gasket(the oil leaks) 

That's a good beginning.

Unfortunately, Monica you did not include all the information regarding
what seems to be a rather expensive repair job. It's impossible to tell
if you even had the engine repaired. Maybe you had a new transmission,
cv's, front wheel bearings and steering done, all of which have little
to do with the fact that your bus ran out of oil due to engine leaks and
inattention.

When things did not go your way, you ran and then did not even give the
repair shop a chance to remedy your problems even though it seems like
they started to help you (for free, even).

Notwithstanding that I know the party you are in conflict with, I would
like to hear, just once how someone was able to resolve difficulties
with a shop, vendor mechanic, rather than hear the complaints prior to
any resolution.

Like the recent Busdepot thread, most of us just grinned, cause we knew
that Ron would take care of the problem and it really didn't need to be
aired here. There are many professionals on and off this list who share
freely of their time and talents, not because they stand to make a buck,
but because they love the &quot;asses that carry them&quot; as Muir put it. They
are men and women of their word. They have and deserve bus kharma.

(rant off)

So having said that, I'll make you an offer, Monica. Give me a call here
in Seattle. We will set a time one evening this week or next, you bring
your bus to my shop and I will volunteer all the time necessary to
diagnose your bus's problems, leaks, etc., plus show you how to do some
of those important things like a compression test, valve adjustment,
belt adjustment, timing, plugs, leaks. No obligation except that you
pass the knowlege along, and no cost to you. I'm not a professional
mechanic, just one who has worked on buses for many years. 

You see, as your neighbor, if I don't help you get &quot;in the solution&quot;
with this, we are still both part of the problem. That hurts my bus
Kharma...
