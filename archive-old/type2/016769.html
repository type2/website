&gt; Question 1:  Is this light just a service reminder light, Or does it carries
&gt; the same weight as the Oil light coming on in mid drive?
&gt; Question 2: How do I shut this little bugger off?
Ian:
Just a reminder, comes on 25.000 miles(or is it 60,000 ?) after being
reset.
There's a little black box somewhere along the speedo cable, I think by
driver's knees. It has a little red push button inside a sleeve, depress
this pushbutton with the tip of the ballpoint pen in you left pocket
(take it out of the pocket first), a magnet will catch it, and you're
set for 25,000 miles. 
Oh , I forgot, put on a new oxygen sensor that it reminded you to
service.
