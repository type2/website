Subject: Need parts 

BlankHello everybody

I finally tore down,that is, re-tore down, my blown up brand new rebuilt
engine.

For background, I completely rebuilt a hydraulic lifter FI 2.0 liter Type IV
and after some initial tinkering, it ran beautifully for about = hour total,
started immediately, idled smoothly, revved up smoothly, sounded perfect,
then I heard a weird knocking and I couldn't shut it off fast enough to keep
it from destroying itself.

On the number 3,4 head, an intake pushrod came out of its rocker arm socket
and got trapped under the rocker arm and broke a big chunk out of the head.
I was hoping that I could have the head welded up, but the broken area is
part of the critical sealing area of the pushrod tube O-ring sealing
surface. I dont think it will be worth having the head welded up and then
machined to get that critical sealing surface, so I am going to keep the
valves and springs and junk the head unless somebody tells me that they have
had great success with similar repairs.

I had lots of helpful advice about what could have caused the premature
failure. I was hoping that the problem was that one of the brand new
hydraulic lifters had failed and come apart, But that wasnt the problem.
The problem was bad gasoline. The bus had sat non-running for 10 years. I
did drain the gasoline tank and flush it out many many times. I drained the
tank with a siphon because the tank output and return lines do no drain to
the bottom of the tank. I started cleaning the tank when I took the engine
out and I kept cleaning it over and over as I waited for my parts from the
machine shop. When I thought is was clean enough, I even set up the electric
fuel pump to recirculate the fuel in a loop through a couple of filters. The
fuel looked clean and smelled right.

The engine did start and run great for about = hour. But... my fuel tank
cleaning was not sufficient or perhaps somebody put something in it and
really did a number on me. Please do not mention anything on this list that
you suspect may have been put into my fuel tank. I don't want to give any
vandals any ideas. Just contact me off list if you know what substance could
have caused this. I was using 10% ethanol gasoline mix and more things will
dissolve in the ethanol portion than would dissolve in pure gasoline.

The machinist said he never saw crude exactly like the crude in my heads.
The machinist speculated that someone put something into my fuel tank. The
intake ports are coated with something like thick maple syrup or not quite
dried varnish. It is thick enough that you can dig your fingernails into it.
The exhaust ports are full of a blacker version of this goo. The machinist
says it all has to be glass bead blasted off again.

And the brand new rubber fuel line near the tank drain was really funny and
soft and swollen. Yes, I am going to re-replace all the fuel lines and the
filter. I am also going to clean out the electric fuel pump by running it in
a double filtered loop again with fresh changes of gasoline. I sure dont
want to spend the money on new or &quot;rebuilt&quot; fuel injectors, so I am
pretending that I wont have to for a little while longer yet.

The valves were really sticky in their brand new fitted guides. I had to use
liquid wrench and push and twist really hard to push them out. I dont know
if the valves will pass the machinists inspection because he hasnt built
me a new head yet because I am still looking for a rebuild able replacement
...

I need a VW type IV head with this exact number inside:

021.101.371S

that is a head from a 1.8 liter year 1974 Type IV engine. It could also come
from different years of VW stationwagens . I would prefer that the head not
have the weird threaded hole in the exhaust ports. I would also like it to
be the 3,4 head for the threaded hole for the temperature sensor. However, I
will take anything I can get for a reasonable price. One of the local VW
shops says they might be able to get me one for $130, but I have to pay up
front and wait an unknown amount of time. I would rather know what and when
I am getting it.

I am also thinking I need a brand new (good used ) fuel tank. I am going to
remove the tank and take it to be boiled out at a radiator shop. I dont
know what to expect, but I am real worried about what was in that tank and I
wonder if it can really be cleaned out.

Does anybody have a Type II bus year 1978 fuel tank they want to sell?

On my rebuild, I did not replace the pistons and cylinders because they were
in great shape. There were no scuff marks on the piston skirts and you could
still feel and see almost all of the little circular rings that are on new
pistons. I just had the machinist crosshatch hone the cylinders and I put on
new rings. I have not yet pulled the pistons and cylinders off to show the
machinist. The piston tops are &quot;tarred&quot; with burnt goo, but the rings seemed
to have scraped the crude off the cylinder walls and keep it going out the
exhaust ports. I didnt show the machinist the pistons and cylinders and
rings. I sure hope they can be used after another honing and new ring$.

Anybody have anymore repair - replacement suggestions for my (sabotaged?)
engine?
