Folks,

I didn't realize that the flywheel controlled float in one direction. A 
couple of kind listers emailed me directly with this really happy info. The 
flywheel is still off !!!!  My stomach is starting to get well :-)

Thanks all, I'll recheck when I get the wheel on it.

Cheers/Don
still troubled about that danged lifter/pushrod/rocker anomaly, but that's 
just pulling a couple of pushrods and tubes, not cracking the cases
:-)
