Subject: VW Bed - kids

Has anyone seen the split window kids bed in the latest Camper and Commercial
magazine? Issue 16, page 17. Besides the color this bed is awesome for a kid.
I cannot afford to have one made and shipped here, but I am thinking that this
might be a nice project for me over the winter. Looks pretty easy to make.

For people without the mag, it is a split window bus that has a full length
twin bed in it. It looks to be made out of just plywood and painted. Looks
really cool. The side doors open so that they can get in it and the roof is
open. Neat idea.
