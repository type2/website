Subject: Nasty noise at cold start on Type 4
Mime-Version: 1.0

Hi guys,

My '76 Crew Cab has just started making a worrying noise when
started from cold.
It is a 2.0l with solid lifters &amp; twin solexes with 147,000klms
since top end overhaul.Only problems in that time have been
1.Burnt out #3 exhaust valve (my fault)
2.Loose valve seat (I'll blame the type4 for that one)

Anyway,when started from cold,it now makes a loud &quot;thump thump thump&quot;
from the right hand bank of cylinders,but only for the first couple of
seconds then shuts up and the engine purrs as it always has done.
In that short time the motor also runs rough,like on only two or three
cylinders and when I press the accelerator pedal,I get a backfire or two
and then it settles down and runs fine.Power is fine once I get going
with no noticeable loss of hp.Motor is properly tuned, timing is OK &amp;
it isn't due for tappett adjustment for another 3000Klms.

This has only happened the last 3 times I have started it from cold
and I probably won't drive it much now till I sort it out.

I'm wondering if it sounds like a valve sticking till it gets lubrication
as that seems to be where the sound eminates,but I would appreciate
any other suggestions/opinions or similar experiences.

Thanks,

PS.Actually it's all my fault.Only the night before I was telling
   a friend &amp; fellow VW nut how good &amp; reliable the engine has been
   for the past 6 years.I was kicking myself even as I said it!
