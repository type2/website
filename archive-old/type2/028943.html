Gary,

We sell used heat exchangers. They normally sell for $100 but we can do $75
each for you. These weigh about 22 lbs each and so figure about $17 for
shipping (for both). Give us a call if you have any questions. Do you need a
muffler? Gaskets?

Subject: [T2] Looking for 74 heat exchangers


I'm looking for a set of decent condition heat
exchangers for my 76 bus.  I'd like to put a set of 74
exchangers in, because they bolt right into the
manifold and simplify everything.  My exhast system
now has some leaks. All the flanges on the pipes were
badly bent and will still not seal well after having
been hammered and filed.  I'm also in need a a muffler
that would fit a 74 and a set of heater control boxes
(mine are rusted through and totally useless).  If
anyone has these to sell and lives near the boston
are, please let me know.

Thanks,
Gary McEachern Jr
