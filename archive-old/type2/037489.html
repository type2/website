Subject: Vanagon Engine Questions

All right here goes.  My van, 80 vanagon, spent the last two months in a
garage undergoing various repairs.  The last thing I did was give it a
tune-up (condenser, points, wires, plugs, filters, elbows, vacuum hoses
. . .)  This is when I started to see what so many of you lose sleep
over . . . the horror, the dread, the punishment of a PO.
Should I be concerned:  1. I crankcase breather tube is hanging there.
Where does it go?  2. There is no cable running from the air flaps to
the thermometer.  Should there be?  Where is the thermometer?  3. The
timing is way off!!!  I set dwell to 48 and the idle is adjusted to 800
RPM.  I located the notch on the pulley.  Take out my light.  Not even
close!  20 BTDC.  I rotate the distributor . . . Idle drops . . . adjust
till I can't adjust anymore . . . stalls.  I then decide to take a
closer look at the distributor.  It appears that when I set the timing
statically the rotor arm is no where near terminal 1.  Is it possible
the the distributor driveshaft is incorrectly aligned?  I know there is
a lot here, but any suggestions would be helpful.
