Subject: Re: [T2] Gas leaks?

Yeaaa!

Check the archives...those were the ones that I mentioned.

Watch their video's on the fireade site as well....especially putting out 
a fire in a gas soaked car(was it really 5 gallons?)....and how well it 
does to cool the metal...and leaves *no* residue.

Good enough apparently that my insurance agent has started including 
fliers for that particular company....but still $20.00 instead of the $12 
or so for foam ones at wallace world.

When I ordered mine(no I haven't used one yet), I asked the guy how come 
he didn't have them in auto stores or wal-mart.

He said that his economy of scale just wasn't up to the task yet....in 
other words, he isn't big enough to interest the really *big* boys yet.

The NASCAR folks sure looked interested enough to install an automatic 
suppresion system in their cars tho.

How much is your bus worth to you??

Whatcha think?

Cheers, dave
