&gt; Looking at the Bentley it specifically says:
&gt; 
&gt; 7.00 x 14 8 PR
&gt; All models through July 1971
&gt; 
&gt; 185SR14 Reinforced
&gt; Campmobile from August 1971
&gt; Delivery Van and Station Wagon from August 1971
&gt; - March 1972
&gt; 
&gt; 185R14X
&gt; Delivery Van and Station Wagon from April 1972
&gt; 
&gt; The important fact I want to point out is that
&gt; for a Campmobile from 1971
&gt; and onward the recommended tire in Bentley is
&gt; the Reinforced variety.  It
&gt; makes sense that for delivery applications and
&gt; carrying 8 people in a
&gt; passenger van that the 185R14C tire is more
&gt; appropriate.
&gt; 
&gt; Next I went to my owners manual and it states
&gt; on page 53, &quot;You VW is
&gt; equipped with tubeless radial tires of either
&gt; designation: 185R14C6PR or
&gt; 185SR14Reinforced.
&gt; 
&gt; I've got a 78 Camper and I've been going mad
&gt; trying to figure out which
&gt; tires are appropriate.
&gt; 
&gt; My final questions on the subject:
&gt; 
&gt; - does Dr. Tim think the reinforced Continental
&gt; tire that just appeared is
&gt; the &quot;perfect tire&quot; for a late bay ( older than
&gt; 1971) Camper?
&gt; 
&gt; - if the reinforced tire is appropriate does
&gt; the 185R14C tire provide for
&gt; better handling when used on a Camper?
&gt; 
Ahhh, you caught that.  So did I, but how does
one answer?  There does appear to be some
contradictory info.  My assumption is that the
&quot;Campmobile 71 on&quot; is a type and should have been
&quot;Campmobile up to and including 71&quot; only because
it would not make sense for the heavier, later
busses to require the heavier tire.  The
opposite, that later busses, &quot;Campmobile 71 on&quot;,
have tires with a lower load rating than a
Stationwagon or panel van 72 and on doesn't make
sense.
