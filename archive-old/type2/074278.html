Subject: Re: [T2] starting problems...

What is the condition of the cable to your starter?  could that be the
cause that the starter's not getting enough juice?

Not really an expert in this area, but I'm sure you'll hear from plenty
that are :)

&gt; Sorry about the long post but perhaps the extra info will help in making suggestions. I recently built an engine for my 71 bus (90.5s, 78 stroke, 44 heads, kadrons) with all new parts. 95% of this engine is brand spankin new. A few weeks ago I was finally able to put the darn thing in, I went to turn the key, with the plugs out so I could prime it, and nothing. Luckily my dad has owned a bus in teh past so he had me underneath, pounding on the solenoid. This worked in allowing it to turn over and it turns like a champ with a new battery and now a rebuilt starter/solenoid. Here is where the problems come in. Whenn the plugs go back in, and I go to turn it over, it will only turn over a couple of times, sort of a whump-whump-whump. It is almost like it can't overcome the compression or something, but I have .090 spacers on it and the compression is only set to about 7.3. I am going to put in a new ignition switch but I don't have a whole lot of hope that this will do the trick!

. I am
&gt; perplexed to say the least. I don't think it is fuel delivery or anything because I am not getting that far. Any help would be awesome as my FLAPS has proved useless. If anyone saw a similar post to this on the volkswebbin site, yes this is the same best of burden, but I have been on vacation. For the love of all that is sacred, help me before I take a hammer to this thing. Thanks.
