Subject: Re: [T2] Aftermarket Tents

I have a great side tent. It is really a utility tent for the phone 
company. It is made to set up next
to equipment cabinets(about the size of  a bus). It has a lip with 
magnets sewn in and two suction cups that have a finger pump to secure 
them. The sides have panels that velcro off and can be replaced with 
screen panels. It comes in a nice heavy duty bag and the tent itself is 
really heavy duty.
I'll try and get some pictures of it.

&gt;&gt;Chuck,
&gt;&gt;I see all this stuff on side mounted tents, and I keep thinking.........
&gt;&gt;Once the tent is set up, you are stuck to it.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;A separate tent allows you to stash your stuff in a bit more security than 
&gt;&gt;just setting things outside on the picnic table, and you can drive away and 
&gt;&gt;return later.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt;my old 65 Westy had a zipper between the tent and the bus.  of course
&gt;getting lined up when one got back was a real trick but surprisingly easy
&gt;once one got used to it.
&gt;
&gt;this was a stock set up on that year I suspect since the whole van was
&gt;stock to the bone when I bought it in 72
&gt;
&gt;&gt;Original side tents have charisma and look kewel.
&gt;&gt;Beyond that, I can't find a reason to have something else to worry about as 
&gt;&gt;to fragility, care, proper storage, preparation for storage, etc.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt;well the one I had was more a &quot;sun room&quot; than an actual tent but it was
&gt;pretty sturdy and tough, sorry I didn't keep it when I sold the van...
