Subject: Re: [T2] 72-79 Pressure Plate bolts


From: &quot;Adrian Pillow&quot; &lt;Apillow_at_manh_dot_com&gt;

&gt; Quick simple-ish question here that I really need to know quickly:
&gt;
&gt; What is the size of the pressure plate bolts on the 72-79 flywheel?  The
&gt; Bentley claims M8x20, but that size is not in a format I recognize.  Usually
&gt; it is something like M8 diameter x 1.25 thread x 20mm long.
&gt;
&gt; Any help is greatly appreciated... Trying to get a '74 Westi engine in and
&gt; to Edisto Freeze Yer Toe by midnight tonight :)  I have a side bet with Dave
&gt; Easterwood for a 6-pack of Guinness that this bus will get there, and I hate
&gt; to loose bets!

Depends on your flywheel:
72/73 1700 uses a 210mm clutch with 8mm bolts.
74/75 1800 uses a 215mm clutch with 7mm bolts.
76 up 2.0L uses a 228mm clutch with 8mm bolts.
The 8mm bolts are 1.25 pitch. 1.25 is the 'standard' pitch for a 8mm bolt.
That is why the pitch is not given. The 8mm bolt normally uses a 13mm wrench
[Japanese cars use a 12mm wrench].
The 7mm bolts use a 8mm triple square socket.
