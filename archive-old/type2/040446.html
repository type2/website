Subject: Re: [Working Fridge]

Clark,
The Dometic fridge that I have in my Riveria only runs on propane as far as 
I know, there are no electrical hook ups and wiring that I can see and if 
the are there I don't think they are hooked up. Therefore I am not too 
familiar with how the 12V part of the fridge works in the westy, but I 
imagine the propane is still the same though. I'm not quite sure if it uses 
a compressor for the electrical side, although I guess it might have to 
otherwise there wouldn't be any way to get the amonia moving inside the 
coils. I think it just took a little persistance and moving the coils around 
to free up and blocks that might have accumulated over the years. Keeping a 
constant air flow over the coils also ensures that it cools properly. It 
worked like a dream this weekend, it kept beer cold and the freezer was 
almost cold enought to make ice. There is a good article of how the ammonia 
works but I can't remember the url right now, but someone out there knows it 
I'm sure.

&gt;Jeff, Did you learn alot about that thing getting it running?
&gt;
&gt;I have a fridge out of 78 in my 74 - but all i have is the fridge 
&gt;(Dometic).
&gt;It has a plug coming out from under the plate with the 'cooler' adjustment
&gt;knob that is marked '12v'.
&gt;I don't see a compressor anywhere and i know the thing has ammonia in it.
&gt;
&gt;How's this thing work?  We apllied 12v to it for a while, but the only 
&gt;thing
&gt;that happened was that the spot the other end of the wire hooks to - 
&gt;whatever
&gt;that it is  - got hot.
&gt;
&gt;thanks,
&gt;clark
