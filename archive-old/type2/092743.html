Subject: Re: [T2] Painting Accelerator Pedal

Assuming you mean the rubber accelerator pedal and not the steel base - 
you've got two options.

You can either buy a new rubber pedal pad or &quot;paint&quot; or &quot;dye&quot; the old one. 
If you want to dye the old one go to the auto parts store and buy vinyl 
dye. It is different than fabric dye in a can. Both look like cans of spray 
paint.

I prefer to source my dye at the auto body shop supplier as the dye is 
better quality.

This is essentially a flexible paint.

I can be used on plastic, vinyl, and rubber.

Clean the surface very well with mineral spirits and then a light cleaning 
with lacquer thinner.

You could also use &quot;bumper black&quot; which is again a flexible paint for 
plastic and rubber (don't know if it is suitable for vinyl).

&gt;I want to paint the accelerator pedal on my 71 Westy..... Any
&gt;recommendations as to what kind of paint?

Ciao!
