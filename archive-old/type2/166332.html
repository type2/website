&gt;cautions against use above 1500m altitude.  1500m is about 5000 feet, so some folks who live or
&gt; camp in the mountains might want to take a look at this.

I think after rereading the manual that came with mine the altitude 
limitation is for delivering fuel to the pump, and not for the for unit 
itself.  In either event I just got back from 3 days and 2 nights at 
above 9000 feet.  It got into the low 20's or high teens.  The heater 
worked flawlessly at those elevations.  The sweet spot was definitely 
towards the lower end of the thermostat.  I slept upstairs and the kids 
were downstairs with the dogs.  I could have used a little more heat 
upstairs, but it was too toasty downstairs.  This was all on the lower 
end of the thermostat.  I can't imagine what the higher end of the 
thermostat would have felt like.

The unit performed as well as I could have imagined.  The altitude 
didn't seem to cause any problems.  All in all i ran the unit for close 
to 28 hours or more on less than 2 gallons of kerosene.  We were toasy 
warm all weekend long.

happy camping!
