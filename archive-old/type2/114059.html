Subject: Re: [T2] Oil: Iis my dad full of it??

&gt;It's an urban legend.  The only bad switch is from a non-detergent oil to
&gt;a detergent oil, but since I haven't seen a quart of non-detergent oil in
&gt;a decade, I suppose that isn't a concern any more.

Advance Auto carrries ND oil... I suspect some of the other FLAPS do too. 
Had to use it in my '49 Chevy p/u b/c the detergent oil was bad (according 
to who I was talking to) b/c it was hard on the babbit bearings or bad 
because all of those engine crud deposits might start floating about if the 
detergent oil was used and started working on them. Either way I was not 
prepared to rebuild the engine... &lt;grin&gt;

FWIW When I first moved to Italy there were alot of rumors that European 
oils could not be used in a car brought from America and vice versa - we 
weren't supposed to use American oils in any little furrin' cars we might 
buy. The Navy was even passing this info out at the orientation for new 
personal.

All of this was apparently b/c European oil was ND a bit longer than US 
oil... Like 1967 versus 1965 in the US or something! By the way I was there 
in 1991-1994... Strange how urban legends persisted. Anyhow I looked at the 
European oils we were buying from Esso and Agip and they were modern oils 
full tested and fully detergentized...
