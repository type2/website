Subject: Re: [T2] Which engine should I use for my 73 Westy?  Found a 2 L I think?

Thanks for the information on the engine everyone.  I was thinking the 2
liter would be best too but for some reason here at Chris's VW they keep
telling me I'll be much happier with a 1776 and using the conversion tin
from a European model.  I found a complete type 4 I'm going to look at
today.  The person selling it says it's a 1800 but it's fuel injected so
it's most likely a 2 liter isn't it?  It's complete with all accessories and
the fuel injection components, harness, computer, etc.  When I look at it
how can I tell for sure it's a 2 liter without getting inside the engine?
John

&gt; &gt;John,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;    You do not want a 1776 in a 73.  The 1776 is based on a Type 1 bug
&gt; &gt;motor.  Your 73 has a type 4 pancake motor in it. (or should have)  I had
a
&gt; &gt;73 with a 2L motor.  It will work great if you can work out the carb
setup.
&gt; &gt;I started out with a Weber 2 barrel &amp; went with a set of Dellorto 40mm.
&gt; &gt;Those were hard to tune but ran great once I got it.
&gt;
&gt; FWIW I agree 100% with Pat.
