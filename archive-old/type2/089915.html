Subject: RE: [T2] re: back bug screen snaps

Hi TJ,

	I figured out a way to attach the screen without need for drilling
holes into my beloved bus.  After looking at the rear screens on several
other busses, it occured to me that the use of snaps is far from the ideal
design to keep bugs out while you are camping.  The gap needed to allow
access to the snaps raises the edge of the screen about 1/8&quot;-1/4&quot; from the
wall, plenty of room to let in creepy crawlers.  
	My solution was to use small (1/2&quot; D x 1/8&quot;) neodymium rare earth
magnets instead of screws in my installation.  To do this, I drilled out the
snaps and then slipped the magnets into the holes left where the snaps were
originally located.  A bit of silicone based adhesive on the back side of
the magnet holds it in place firmly and the resulting fit is much tighter
than any other screen setup I have seen.
	The magnets can be purchased online for $1.01ea at the following
