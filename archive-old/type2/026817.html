Folks,
   I highly recommend Everybus to everyone.  This New Yorker was able to go 
last year and was shown the meaning of &quot;southern hospitality&quot;.  It didn't 
seem to matter that I showed up in car other than a VW after my bus 
experienced problems on the way down.  Within minutes after arriving I was 
taken from campfire to campfire and introduced around by someone who had 
just met me himself.  Despite last years rain, it was a good weekend with 
some great people and their buses.  If only I could get off from work the 
end of April, I'd be there!
