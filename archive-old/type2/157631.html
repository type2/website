Subject: Re: [T2] gas smell sources 

Thanks for early replies, and I will certainly
look into the vent tube idea, but note that
this bus has not been started much less driven
in a month and has sitting in the cold and on
the level.  The wife reports that the smell is
growing stronger over time which implies continued
evaporation of gas from somewhere.

And this is a 1978 fuel-injected bus, which I
should have said.  There is a dry, unmarked
sheet of corrugated cardboard under it, but 
there aren't even any oil leaks much less gas.
The oil was changed just before putting it away,
so even if there is somehow gas in the oil after
much driving, there has not been more than about 
10 miles on this oil change.
