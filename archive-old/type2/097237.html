Subject: [T2] About to go look at a 72 Westy project bus for sale...

Hi, I just joined the list a few days ago and its time to start asking a few
questions. This is going to be a long post being a first post :-)

A little background, I'm very lacking in any practical knowledge about VW's
and air cooled engines (I do work on my cars w/ no problem) but would like a
small camper and I'm currently planning a small teardrop trailer project,
however I have always liked the Westy and other VW camper buses. (Who doesn't
think there cool!?)

Anyway I don't expect anything I can afford to buy will be reliable and
pretty, and from what I understand of VW's even if it is pretty, reliability
is another thing entirely. Anyway I don't need reliability. I've got a daily
driver and the # for the local tow service in my cell phone if ever needed. I
need a good solid project bus to learn on, owning a pretty one can come later
as time &amp; money allow.

Well currently there is a camper listed in my local paper, ad reads something
like 72 VW camper,shop rebuilt valves, rebuilt engine, new rings, seals,
gaskets, rear  tranny, heat exchanger, missing roof!, needs paint ~500.00 obo

Sounds like a project basket case and visions of a soggy (no roof in Florida)
rusty crunchy Northeast bus sitting in a back yard came to mind! I ignored the
ad for a few days and continued planning my teardrop, but upon coming across
the paper yesterday I decided why not call and find out some more info. You
never know it could be 30yr old FL bus with some surface rust and a few non
structure holes in it and maybe just the canvas is missing from the roof...
Yea right! I'm sure it won't be MY BUS but if I don't start looking at them up
close and learn something I'm never going find my bus!

Well I called the ad today, a lady answers and basically describes the ad to
me, she doesn't know much else about it. Turns out she's selling the bus for
her son who was unable to finish it and has gone off to school which is why he
needs to get rid of it, its in the garage of a house she is renting out and
she's trying to get a hold of the renters so I can go look at it. The only
info she could offer beyond the ad is that it may need some carb work or a
rebuilt carb and she's not even sure its running right now. :-)

I'm assuming the worst, a really sad sorry rusted out NE unibody (definitely
not MY BUS) A &quot;rebuilt&quot; engine that's had god knows what done to it in the
name of &quot;rebuilding&quot; etc.

Even if this is the state of things I still want to take a hard look at it for
educational purposes and perhaps try and get it started and closely listen to
what a good or not so good running motor sounds like etc. so that the next one
I look at I'll be just a bit more knowledgeable then I am now.

So if anyone can offer some practical, general type advice about things to
check or try when looking at a 30 year old bus....

An example of something practical would be: look on the this side of the
engine bay, this whatever shaped thing over here is the fuel pump and if its
not hooked up or the lines look rotten DON'T try to start it! I'm pretty sure
if I burn down the rental property its parked in, she and her renters are
going want to kick my butt! :-)

Browsing the net I've read a lot the last few days about bay window T2s with
the T4 engine and now have a general understanding of how they work and what
tinware and seals etc should be present and places to look for leaks etc. so a
really basic level of comfort has been established.

Assuming it doesn't look like a fire hazard I'm going to put the key in it,
turn it, see if I get power &amp; maybe 2 lights on the dash, if not hook up a
portable jumpstart pack, turn the key, put the pedal to the floor and release
it then crank it over and see if it starts. maybe it just cranks, or starts &amp;
stalls or starts &amp; runs rough. etc If I get it running any bad sounds or
smells (unburnt gas) to specifically listen for? what the may indicate?

If I cant get it started as above any wisdom on tricks to do, proper way to
cross fingers and bite tongue while pumping the pedal and cranking it? :-)
I've just read its common to have to press downward on the shifter to get it
to go into reverse, knowing little things &amp; idiosyncrasies like this can make
all the diff in looking at something.

Backseat Drivers Wanted TM ;-)

I'm not going to go over it with any detailed check list, I'm just going to
check it out the best I can mechanically, structurally, inside and out based
on what I can remember in my head and if I'm pleasantly surprised that its
basically solid project bus I'll make a gut judgment call on whether to make
her an offer on it. perhaps it will at least be a good learning bus I can have
some fun with and get (most) of my money back out of later...

If you can think of any really useful tips to plant in my head before I go
look let me know!

Thanks...
