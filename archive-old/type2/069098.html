Subject: fuel injection, 77 bus.

Hi All,
  Thanx for your help on the fuel injection mystery of Karen's Bus. 
It turns out the air intake sensor was actually okay. I proceeded to 
check the power supply for the electric fuel pump. I knew I was onto 
something when I noticed it would get juice during startup, but not when running. 
Turns out one of the white wires in the plastic multi-wire plug of 
the double relais was coming off intermittently, which interrupted 
power to the fuel pump. Took me long enough to figure this out, but 
at least I finally got my money's worth out of my electrical 
multi-meter. ..
  
  Thanks again!
                                Gregor
