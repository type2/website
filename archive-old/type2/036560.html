Subject: Re: disintegrated needle bearing-my odd symptom on high milage engine

To George Lyle et al:  MB here with my business signature- I'm the guy
with the 213,000 orig. miles on the engine, except for a replaced clutch
friction disk at 150K and changed hydraulic lifters/seals.  Even the
alternator, distributor, fuel pump, etc are original!  The posts on
needle bearing got me to wondering.....an odd, intermittant symptom is
occuring, noticed when I push the clutch in, say to stop at a light.....
you hear a funny &quot;deep&quot; noise (like in trans to engine area when you are
driving) which sounds/feels kinda like the clutch is briefly engaging-
not constant, just a little hiccup of a rumble.   It does not get worse
if I &quot;rev&quot; the engine with clutch pedal in, actually, better.   This is
fixed by just putting it in neutral to wait and shift to drive off. 
Shifting is ok, although getting into 1st is sometimes difficult, as is
1st to second if I do it on a steep hill.  While driving and shifting,
no problems.  Could this in any way be due to some wobble in the clutch
disk if the needle bearing is going/gone?  Anyone know wht the symptoms
are if it's gone?  
     When I changed the disk in 1995, I can't remember greasing the
flywheel hole, and did have an odd symptom somewhere camping in the
rockies- on a wet FOGGY morning, the car acted like
the clutch was engaged even when pedal was all the way down (ie, the car
jumped when I started it).  I can't remember if I had trouble shifting
after trying it in neutral, but I think it &quot;broke free&quot; and started ok
after that, with no such trouble for next 5 years!  Maybe the damp
somehow &quot;glued&quot; the disk to the pressure plate?  I do get shuddering on
lots of traffic shifting when it heats up -when clutch is let out and
shudders, I just push it in and let it out again.  I had that symptom on
the original disk, which I noted had one broken spring.  So what's going
on- can I assume that high revs create a gyroscope effect (like a bike
wheel, it centers itslf easier, or is it just held by the pressure
plate?, but at low reves (clutch in , 900 rpm) it may wobble causing the
&quot;engaging&quot; sound here and there even with release bearing doing its
thing?
