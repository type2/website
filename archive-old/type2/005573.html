&gt;no picnic, and the replacements aren't cheap.  The 195 tires result in
&gt;noticibly increased steering effort at a standstill.  I'm sure that
&gt;the 205s would be higher still since the wider tread and larger
&gt;contact patch increase the moment arm through which the frictional


I hate to object to George but frankly I don't buy this one bit at least as
195's go.  First off you see so much variation from tire manufacturer to
manufacturer in width because of how the edges roll off that one
manufacturer's 195 will often be narrower contacting than anothers 185.
Start trying to fit tires to the max under an A1 Scirocco and you'll get the
picture, change manufacturer and stuff don't fit not more.  Especially for
the bus if you are comparing apples to oranges as tread patterns go, most
highway rib designs are narrower and harder rubber, most all season wider,
etc. etc. etc.  I have a set of 195/75R14 C loader all season Sears tires on
the '77 now that are 5-10mm narrower than 185R14 XZX's  something I measured
one day as chains adjusted for the Sears were to narrow to fit the XZX set
well.  Plus I believe steering response is probably again far more
influenced by tread and how sticky the compound is.  Now I'm not objecting
to the 205.  The 205/70R14 vanagon tire is noticeably wider and in 2 sets
I've had between vanagon and bus showed more effort steering to park.  All
the 195/75R14 LT's I've had over the years have been in my mind no
different.  I consider it a quite acceptable size equivalence for a Bus,
rolling diameter is just a hare smaller I believe and there is a much wider
availability in reinforced rubber.

On the far side of this I've run 27x8.5R14 on a bus as well (Firestone
Wilderness AT's) and was actually amazed at the fact they didn't feel that
much heavier than 205/70 Michelin MXL's.  At this sort of extreme I would
start worring about damage to steering components, for more normal swaps,
frankly VW stuff is pretty sternly built, even those fragile earlier boxes,
though I agree they are no picnic to replace, and they are getting on in
years, and when was the last time you checked their oil level.

For budget rubber anyway the Continental in 185R14 from Tire Rack is a
proper tire, does about as well as the XZX did and is still I think under
$50 a pop, it is better in my mind than the only other thing in that range,
the Yoko Y356 C rater which is a highway rib and totally useless in my
recollection in snow and not all that nice in heavy standing water though my
only experience was with a set with 30-40k on them.
