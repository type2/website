Subject: 85 Westy Vanagon question
Date: Fri, 15 Jun 2001 21:57:08 -0500
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

A local dealer has an 85 Vanagon for sale. The interior is in like new
condition. The body is very nice, with rust peeking thru above both  rear
fenders. It's running strong, the AC doesn't work, but everything else does.
I did find an anti-freeze leak on the water pump and one of the hoses. I
don't anything about Vanagons, only that the engines had a very bad
reputations, but for $1,500 asking price,  I'm very tempted. What do you
guys think? Suggestions, ideas, comments welcome.

Victor
