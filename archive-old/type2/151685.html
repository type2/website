Arrrrgggghhhh,

Bob, go look at my old posts on this subject...think it was called 
&quot;fireade&quot;.

http://www.fireadesource_dot_com/fire-ade-applications.html

Check them out on nascar cars....?????

Be ****SURE**** and look at the burning vehicle shots here
http://www.fireadesource_dot_com/fireade-demos.html
Bigger size than I carry, but they already lit off 5 gallons inside the 
car first too...

Doesn't leave residue&lt;raised eyebrows&gt;....

How much more do I have to say?

Oh, and smaller container than the usual stuff....

Apparently so good that now my local insurance company(Farm Bureau)) keeps 
them in stock and will sell you one when you walk thru the door!

For the same price as listed on the web site.

No, I haven't had to use any of mine yet.

Cheers, dave
