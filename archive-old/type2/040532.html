Subject: FF: Bus without (current) purpose

Following is a question that came up on an entirely different:
=================================================

Original Question:
***********************

&gt; is: just how many Synergy programmers are there who own a
&gt; bus?  then, how many live in their bus, or lived in their bus

Which of course prompted me to step in and write:
**************************************************************

Interesting question:

On last count I had 4 (see http://www.hrps_dot_demon.nl/jwbus)

The red one is one of my 'company cars' and is the 'Jack of all Trades'. I
use it to go to my customers (it is a camper but I  hardly ever really camp
in it). My other company car is the beige '69er. Since this is a very nice
entirely original vehicle (un-restored, a real show winner) I don't use it
in winter when there is salt on the roads.

There is one (the brown one) that currently has no purpose but I'm
considering turning it into a mobile office. This will mean I have to:

- Get rid of the middle and rear bench
- Stick black film to the windows so people can't look in from outside.
- Install a custom-built 'office' interior (preferably with fully adjustable
black leather seats)
- Install a 100 mbps hub under the drivers' seat.
- Run UTP cat 5 cable and install sockets all around the 'cargo bay'
- Install a 12 Volt to 230 V (European mains voltage) inverter in the engine
bay and run cables to all of the mains outlets.
- Build an equipment cabinet in the rear (over the engine) that includes an
666 MHz P3 Windows/NT server with about 50 GB of hard disk and appropriate
backup (fully suspended of course so the CD player will not jump track when
I use it to play my favorite CD on the server while driving over speed
bumps). Of course I will have to run Windows-2000 and so it needs at least
512 MB of RAM.
- Install one fixed and one portable workstation (laptop), a color laser
printer, GPS, etc etc etc ....
- I'm still considering radio-frequency wireless transceivers so I can use
the laptop in a area of about a 1000 feet around the vehicle without having
to be attached to it by cables but this may be taking it too far.
- And most importantly: a water-cooler, 3-way fridge and many many
cup-holders (these seem to be the most important accessory in new cars).

Now all of this is quite feasible. The only thing that bugs me is how to
secure the car so the first junky that comes around will not try to steal my
$25 in-dash stereo ........ :-(
