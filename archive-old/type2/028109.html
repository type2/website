Well, someone got screwed, but not me. The guy who sold me the bad camshaft agreed, without fussing, to take it back and return my money. His words were something to the effect that he's not in this hobby to screw people, buses, donkeys, or anything else. He takes pride in his own honor and restores some dwindling faith to me. In fact, I feel a little ashamed for assuming he would cheat me.

Thanks! Joe
