Message-ID: &lt;a3afa9e4.24ae4e83_at_aol_dot_com&gt;

I'm passing along this information recently mailed to me. I plan on going if 
I get my 75 bus engine back together and running (a big if).

Mountain VW's is sponsoring their 3rd Annual . . .

Chucky's Redneck Camp on July 10 and 11, 1999 at Triple Creek Campground in 
Cosby, Tennessee.  DIRECTIONS. Take I-40 to exit #440 (near Newport, Tn) and 
follow the signs to Triple Creek Campground. Sites are shaded, creekside with 
water &amp; electric. Cost $15. Great tent sites also. For info: (423) 623-5710 
and campground info (423) 623-2020.

A VW Campout for those who dare to be different.

Chili Cookoff. Limit Two Quarts, Please!! Note: We're looking for a new judge 
due to the untimely passing of our previous one. Must have own protective 
gear. Winner awarded weekend for two at Chestnut Ridge Cabins.

Bike Rally.  Buddy McDonald Memorial (he ain't dead yet) Bike Rally. Course 
laid out through campground. Special prize for winner provided by Buddy 
himself.

Red Neck 500. NASCAR Winston Cup Style Racing in minature form. Well 
almost--Winner sits in Champion's Chair while the losers cater to their every 
(almost) desire.

NO ENTRY FEES.  FREE BUFFETS. (Bring a side dish if you want--NOT REQUIRED).  
FREE ENTERTAINMENT.  Dash placques for the first 50. Redneck King &amp; Queen 
Awards. Collectible T-shirts. Contests &amp; Prizes. Huge Playground for Kids.

Note:  This is not a camp for recovering Rednecks not is it a camp providing 
instruction on becoming one. This is a VW campout for those who just want to 
be a Redneck for a weekend. We dress Redneck, talk Redneck, tell Redneck 
jokes, play Redneck games and have a ball doing. THIS IS A FAMILY GATHERING 
so we don't really use the entire Redneck vocabulary.
