You will be terrified how quickly it pops out with only a light application
of compressed air.  Have a board in there in fact for it to thunk into.  Now
both may come out, or only one that is the less stuck.  then you do one
side, clamp it in, blow out the other.  Of course it is all a bit self
defeating as unless you got the caliper body seals you can't unbolt the
halves to really hone things and the best you can do is use 320-400 grit
silicon carbide paper to clean stuff up.  That and new seals does often work
pretty well though.  But around me Advanced sell &quot;lifetime rebuilds&quot; for $30
a pop so at $20 for the seals the time screwing with them really defeats the
purpose.  That is for the late caliper though I don't know about the
'71-'72.
