&gt; My daily driver is a Jeep, which is one cold ride, especially in this bitter

You can always tell when it gets really cold in the northern tier, because
the issue of the electric heater comes up.

Here's the math.  Assuming that you can use the entire output of a bus
generator (38A) you can extract 38x13=494W of power to heat the bus.

In reality, you cannot get that much power out of the generator
continuously, since some power is needed to run the vehicle.  You might
get 400W if you use biiiig wires.

400W is about 1500BTU in heating energy units.  This is 1/2 as much heat
as a Coleman catalytic heater, which is a pretty meager heat source in its
own right.

The short answer is that the electric heaters only warm the wallets of the
people who are selling them.  They won't do the same for a car.
