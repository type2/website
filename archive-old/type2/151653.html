Subject: Re: [T2] Tank Crud - Alternatives?

Josh,

Go read the info sheet on Marine Clean and the other stuff at the por-15 
site.

http://www.por15_dot_com/Default.asp?

Everything you need to know.

por-15 itself should be treated with care, but if I remember correctly, 
Marine Clean is biodegradeable.

Cheers, dave

&gt; Hey Folks!
&gt; 

snipped

&gt; tonight and what came out was not pretty. I read Richard's POR-15 
approach,
&gt; and this is what I was thinking of doing. My big concern is my wife-to-be
&gt; will kill me if I hurt our lawn in any way! But really, I want to be able to
&gt; dispose of these chemicals properly, and that's kind of tough in my town.
&gt; Any advice for alternatives? Are there any shops which may be better setup
&gt; to do this?
&gt;
