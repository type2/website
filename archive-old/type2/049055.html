Subject: Re: [T2] Re: [VB] HF sand blaster

Guess I should clarify, they do sell quite a bit of sand blasting equipment.
     I think it would be considered a pot type blaster, not the syphon feed 
type, and not a cabinet. the kit consist of a red metal tank with two wheels 
to move it around, a hose, and a nozel. normally sells for about $129 on sale 
for around $89. I would be interested to here from those who have used both 
the pot type and the syphon feed type and how they compare. I realy need to 
clean the underside of the 59 up and get the suspension back in.
thanks

&lt;&lt; Is that the table top one? if so thats a joke. No hookup to vaccuum out the
 dust, Sand blows out of the top likes its not even attached, sand blows out
 of all the seams, air attachment leaked as well. 2 tubes of silicant sealer
 later, still leaks sand out of the seams..have to use it ouside with a
 respirator and its still unbearable and messy..may as well have bought just
 a pickup-line and a bag of sand.
