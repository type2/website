Subject: Gas Tank


I think the archives have this info but I think its a good time to look at 
this issue again.

The gas tank (at least from the late 60's to 71 if not later) have a pipe 
that sticks up into them about 1 inch with a screen on them. This is like a 
prefilter. Unfortunatly hardly anyone gets in there and has a look at it 
much less clean it.

The pipe was intended to help keep sediment from flowing into the gas line, 
but with busses getting so old, it presents a new problem:

Water gets into the tank and causes rust. This water cant get out, with fuel 
being &quot;lighter&quot; then water, it floats on top, leaving a easy way for rust to 
develop in the tank.

In my 69 I took that pipe out of the tank, threw away the filter (screen) 
and cut the pipe down so it was level with bottom of the tank. This keeps 
the water from sitting on the bottom.

I hope this helps.

Jason
