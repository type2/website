Subject: RE: [T2] Bending fuel line

I bent some fuel line awhile back and I bought a tube bender for the project.
It worked great, got it off Ebay for a few bucks. You can bent the tube
manually, but you risk kinking it. Maybe someone on the list knows of a
technique for doing this, but I just bought the tool. Figured it would work
well if I ever had to produce new brake lines also.
