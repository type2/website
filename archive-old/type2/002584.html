Subject: Re: [T2] master cylinder rubber

I just got of those plastic sleeves that fit in the tube ends from the
dealer 1 month ago for about  $1 apiece.

&gt; Hiya Patrick,
&gt;
&gt; Just went through the same thing with my 70 Bus when I redid the brake
&gt; system.  Here's what I found out..............
&gt;
&gt; The little rubber sleeves for the brake fluid feed tube are no longer
&gt; available.  Inasmuch as the plastic brake fluid feed tube is molded to use
&gt; these &quot;sleeves&quot; if you don't have the sleeves you have to find an
alternative
&gt; feed tube.  My sleeves were still there but in terrible shape.  Both were
&gt; almost a lumpless shape of goo by the time I got them off.  So, I went the
&gt; new tube route.
&gt;
&gt; I went down to a local business, Oil Filter Service, here in Portland and
&gt; described my predicament.  I also took my brake fluid reservoir to make
sure
&gt; the hose would fit.  Presto!  They had the just the beast I was looking
for.
&gt; About $3.00 a foot for a corrosive resistant hunk of tube.  What's more It
&gt; fit snugly through the body grommet for the old hose after I &quot;hollowed
out&quot;
&gt; the grommet a touch.  Worked out very well for me.
&gt;
&gt; I'd suggest you find a business in your area which specializes in ind
&gt; ustrial/high strength hose and fittings.  They should be able to do you up
&gt; nicely.  If you need the name of the stuff, let me know and I'll go out
get
&gt; behind the kick panels and let you know.
&gt;
&gt; Mike
