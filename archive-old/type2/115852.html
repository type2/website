&gt; The outside ones fit fairly well, but the inside ones were a royal

So the kit comes with both the inside and outside metal trim?
 
&gt; They are supposed to end flush with  the vent wing channel.
&gt; 
&gt; The outside ones are alos *not* made as the original.

I've heard this from a few people now via pmail. What's the most likely
reason for this?
