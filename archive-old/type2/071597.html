Subject: Re: External Oil Cooler
X-Diagnostic: MESSAGE REQUIRES APPROVAL

well, first of all, what year is your bus, which engine? Honestly just go add 
an oil pressure and an oil temp guage, if you run consistantly over 230/240, 
its external cooler time, also, did you try the dipstick test? (grab the 
dipstick tube way down where it goes through the fanshroud (type 4) if you 
can hold it your not to hot) not sure if it really works but some people on 
the list swear by it.  I think the oil light goes on at around 5 psi so IF 
YOU SEE IT YOU ARE DOING DAMAGE TO THE ENGINE. Cant stress that enough.
