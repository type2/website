Yes, despite my shortcomings in the heart department these days, I can still
stand.  However, please do remember that the Westfalia is driven in the
seated position ;-)

&gt; Y'all get to Mr. Thompson and, being the fine, upstanding (You are
&gt; still able to stand, right?) WetWesties member that he is, he'll see
&gt; that it makes a PNW tour.  LA to the wetside is easy. There's always
&gt; a bunch traveling that route.
&gt; If it makes it here by September or October, we'll send it back
&gt; through our northern neighbors and it should be able to start its 2nd
&gt; circumnavigation next spring. (Hopefully in something less than nine
&gt; years....)

&gt; &gt; Hi Jim,
&gt; &gt; Troy Wiccal and Dan Radom are planning to pick it up., possibly as
&gt; &gt; soon as this weekend. How 'bout if  they give it to Mark at EveryBus
&gt; &gt; and he passes it to you at Sevierville?  Where it goes thereafter is
&gt; &gt; between you and the Hubcap.
&gt; &gt; Happy Trails,
