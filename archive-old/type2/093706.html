Subject: The old no title havin' blues

Ok
for the 4700th time...  I just got a Great '74 transporter NO TITLE in NC. (for $50 Woohoo)  What do I do???  I keep hearing about Title service companies.  Has anyone ever dealt with one?  The &quot;legit&quot; process here requires an insurance bond and many, many days.  Please help me.

Thanks,
Eric and ZebraBus
