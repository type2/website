&gt; &lt;&lt;&gt;My mechanic is telling me that GEX is bad news in general &gt;&gt;
&gt; 
&gt; I have my own horror stories regarding GEX.  It's all in the archives, and I
&gt; won't repeat it here.
&gt; 
&gt; I bought the engine before I was on this list and I knew better.  I think
&gt; there are several better rebuilders out there.  You may pay a few more bucks,
&gt; but you are far better off with someone else.
&gt; 
&gt; On the other hand, how is your engine setup with carburation?  Are you running
&gt; the original setup with the stock dizzy?  If you have repeated head failure,
&gt; it's possible that you are running too lean, or have other problems.  Are you
&gt; using any oil temp. or oil pressure gauges?
&gt; 
&gt; Make sure that your check everything out after you fix your problems to make
&gt; sure they won't return.  If you're not running the oil pressure and oil temp
&gt; gauges, make sure you install these.  Check your spark plugs and tail pipe for
&gt; signs of a lean mixture.
&gt; 
&gt; Hope this helps.

Steve:
See my subsequent post- I think you have the answer right there: LEAN!
But it sure was difficult to determine: it was only lean when it was
really hot. Actually I roasted another motor and the valve guides in a
3rd before I figured out the problem. The only reason the 3rd was only
guides was because I'd installed sodium-cooled valves and 74 heads. tThe
sodium cooling moved the heat to the guides and wore them out in 30,000
miles, but kept the faces from burning!
