&gt;On a related topic, anyone know where the notch should be pointing at max.
&gt;advance on a pancake engine?  I've heard 30 degrees bandied about, but I
&gt;think that's for an upright; is the Type 4 any different?
&gt;

&quot;IF&quot; you have a 2.0 and are using the P or S distributor: you will have 
8.5-11º of vacuum advance and 20.5-24.5º of centrificul advance at 3400 
rpm's + your intial timing of 7.5º. This adds up to 36.5 to 43º total 
advance. Your scale only goes to 40. When everything is working correctly 
the mark will go to the o in vor [past 40]. This is how VW designed this 
engine to run. Add it up...the figures are in Bentley.
