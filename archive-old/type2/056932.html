Subject: Re: Starter motor problems

After fitting the WR-1 kit, we now know that the starter is getting all
the juice it needs, but how are the ground leads ?

check the tranny to chassis ground lead for fraying or bad connections.

I've also seen a local garage here, actually move the battery ground
from the chassis (next to the FI computer) to the fan housing. - I
wouldn't have tried that, but it seems to have improved things.

-this was in my girlfriends bus to cure starting problems after;

replacing the starter 3 times,
tightening the plug into the ignition switch, 
fitting the WR-1 kit,
and installing new positive battery cables.
