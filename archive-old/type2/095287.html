Subject: Re: [T2] Distributor Rebuild

Bosch makes(or made, I'm not too sure anymore) a rebuild kit for their 
dizzys, that included screws, washers, shims, and other assorted goodies.  I 
have one somewhere...I'll try and find it and see what the part number is.  
Anyone else out there know what I'm referring to with access to the part#?  
I was looking to rebuild my 205T as well.  Turned out all she needed was a 
good cleaning and lube.  Still have the kit.

     Eron

&gt;Hiya List,
&gt;
&gt;Is it possible to rebuild a distributor?  In this case a Bosch 205T.  Do
&gt;Flaps or the online joints have rebuild kits for these things?  Or is there
&gt;an auto electrical service which rebuilds dizzys?  I'm thinking that I 
&gt;SHOULD
&gt;know the answer to this one, but I've never before had an old dizzy which I
&gt;wanted to renew.  So, I throw myself on the mercy of the List.  Info?  
&gt;Hints?
&gt;  Suggestions?
&gt;
