Subject: '66-'67 SO-42 Wood Quest'n (gurus pls. help!)

Alright, here are  the Givens:
given #1.  1/8&quot; White Baltic Birch Paneling
given #2. Grain of all interior wood pieces on vertical surfaces runs vertically
given #3. Grain of all interior wood pieces on roof surfaces runs length of bus.
given #2  A piece of paneling exists below the closet window (behind the
cargo doors) that measures 23&quot; x 30.25&quot; with allowances for the wheel well.

Specific piece in Question:
Piece(s) on drivers side wall, below the windows and behind the bench
divider and back to the D.S. wheel well.
Questions:
1. Is the wood paneling one piece or two?
2. If it &quot;should be&quot; one piece WHERE does anyone get a piece that measures
71.25&quot; wide X 30.25&quot; height with **vertical** grain?!
2a. Provide specific location etc. if you have a location etc.
3. If two pieces, does the piece behind the divider measure 4' in width X
30.25&quot;?

The only thing I can imagine is that the Westfalia (the sadists) special
ordered wood with the grain running the &quot;wrong way&quot; to achieve the vertical
grain while retaining the huge-mongus width. Even the fancy dancy 5'x5'
Birch sheets won't help in this case. Besides I don't think Jim Davis is
planning another trip to Phoenix very soon. I don't think I can talk him
into dragging more fancy wood across the desert from LA.

Don't tell anyone (esp the vintage nazis) but I think VanBondo is going to
punt on this one and gracefully install (gasp) two pieces and retain the
vertical grain. One which measures 4' in width X 30.25&quot; and one which is the
exact mirror of the closet side piece. I can hear my guardian angel telling
me to get a life and drive the darned bus... Me thinks a little glue from
the back side and wood pencil from the front will throw the wood pretty much
into the stealth mode.
