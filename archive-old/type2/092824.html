&gt;Here we go with the questions:
&gt;Is the 2.0 FI motor correct for a 77 bus?

Yes, but there are some differences between the years.  Nothing that would 
cause a problem.

&gt;I have a 1.7 carbed long block in the shed; would that fit the 77 engine
&gt;compartment?

Yes.

&gt;Will the tin, alternator, etc, from the 2.0 fit on the 1.7 long block?

Yes, but there is an issue with the clutch/flywheel/bellhousing/starter.

You could use the 1.7 parts (c.f.b.s), but you will be 1/2&quot; short overall 
on the engine/tranny due to the thinner bellhousing.  It will probably bolt 
up but you may have to shove/flex/pry some stuff to get it installed.  A 
better solution would be to use all of the 76-79 parts (c,f,b,s) and bolt 
them to the 1.7 engine.  That way you get the bigger clutch and everything 
will line up properly.  But I'd get the 2.0 running before I'd install the 
carb'ed 1.7

&gt;Is the 77 transmission an NLA, one year only beast, or are they readily
&gt;available?

Any 76-79 tranny should work.

&gt;Do I need another bus in my yard?

You already know the answer to that.  :)

&gt;Do I want another project? I have never dealt with FI before.

Don't be scared of it - you will likely never go back to carbs once you 
have it running properly.
