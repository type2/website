Subject: Re: [T2] pop-up tent replacement

According to the website, www.plfvw_dot_com, these are the exact reasons that
Dawn decided to build a better poptop canvas.  There's even a picture in a
swatch on the site for the fringe: the first time I've ever seen mention of
a reproduction of this item.

I haven't bought one of these because I'm waiting to repaint my bus but I'm
seriously considering it.

&gt; There is only one manufacturer, so no matter where you buy the canvas you

&gt; acrylic material is primarily used for marine applications, and its big
&gt; claim to fame is that the color doesn't fade even after prolonged exposure
&gt; to bright sunlight (like on a boat). But since a VW poptop is not exposed to
&gt; nearly that much continuous sunlight, I have never even seen the cotton ones
&gt; fade after years.  On the other hand, the acrylic is a bit more rigid,
&gt; making it somewhat difficult to fold and close the poptop. The acrylic does
&gt; have a slightly smoother finish than the cotton, and is perhaps a bit more
&gt; stock looking in that regard, although the yellow acrylic is extremely
&gt; bright in color.  Personally, it would perhaps be a close call if the two
