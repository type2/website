I looked a little closer at the pictures and can see that the bolt being removed
is a theft proof bolt. When
I look at my own bus from underneath I can see the shear bolts. They hold the
column to the body.(Thanks
Karl for the parts numbers) . I&quot;ll need these soon as I just repainted  the
front windshield frame. I removed the
shear bolts with a pair of vise grips. The theft proof bolt was already replaced
with a allen screw and yes, my
ignition key is not the same as the doors.

&gt; The true shear bolts hold the column to the body. They are part # 211 415
&gt; 549 and were used from vin #214 2164 060.
&gt; The bolt Brad removed is a tamper proof bolt to hold the steering lock to
&gt; the column to slow down thieves and has nothing to do with collapsing in an
&gt; accident.
&gt; When you get in an accident and you run into something in front of you, your
&gt; momentum and your body pushes the column forward. The shear bolts holding
&gt; the column to the body shear and the column moves forward.
