Subject: Re: Special Bartnik/Van Ness Tech Site

&gt;Due to continuing problems with the type2_dot_com web server, nobody has 
been
&gt;able to update anything on the site lately although it still runs. Both
&gt;Sean Bartnik and Ron Van Ness have been wanting to do significant 
updates,
&gt;so we've brought up an alternative page.
&gt;
&gt;	http://buslist.dynip_dot_com

As a note on this topic, I have been unable to connect to the type2_dot_com 
server to transfer my web page files, so I've partially uploaded some 
REALLY OLD backups and I haven't finished uploading images and other 
stuff.  The pages don't look great and aren't up to date at all.  I'm 
working on it.  I wish I could get into type2_dot_com as then I could 
transfer the updated files...

BTW, the '78 Bus Owner's Manual is temporarily down while I remodel that 
particular page.  I'll try to get it back up ASAP.

Thanks for your patience...
