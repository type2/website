 3 weeks ago I described Ashley's (my van) problem with a front brake giving
off smoke &amp; flame. Well it has now finaly been fixed.
Al Brase go it right when he suggested the caliper would need a rebuild, it
did but being an earlier one we couldn't get the bits !(OK I know a month
long serch might have turned something up but I wanted to use it a week
later). 
So my friendly mechanic replaced the calipers, disks and stub axles with
those from a later (bigger disk) van - I don't care about origionality - I
want to stop !  Cost was £180 all in - not too bad I thought and at least
the bits will be easier to come by in the future. 

This all looked good so we drove to Stanford Hall VW show.

Excellent show, some very nice T2's although only one bay (loaf) in the
concours - why so few ? Lots of nice vans in the car park &amp; a huge turnout
&gt;from the splittie club. Weather superb. This show is getting bigger each
year so UK listees (and US ones who want a trip) ought to note it in thier
diary. Anyway there were more dashboard clocks than I have ever seen in one
field before - I got one for 40 quid but it was imaculate and that is what
clocks cost I am told (by other people not just the seller !) and will go in
when I sort my speedo face out - the van has a later speedo at present but I
still have the broken original. At last a clock on my dash, I really miss
having one and no, a naff digital number will not do. Also around were 2
fibreglass spare wheel mounts FOR A FIVER EACH and guess who paid a lot more
for one of these &quot;rare as hens teeth&quot; items last year ? Still you win some
you loose some, I've still only ever seen 3.
Alan Schofield was selling his restored van for £6500 which considering the
state of it isn't a bad buy - I understand that £10000 worth of panels etc
have gone into it and he has used it as a show vehicle for his panel
manufacturing business so it is imaculate. Also imaculate and on sale for a
similar figure was an unrestored concours Devon convesion (1970 model I
think). Funniest site was on the way out, the new T2 demostrater was loaded
onto  a transporter with a new (old shape) beetle, now the T2 was on a
slanted paltform over the bug and looked like it was about to be launced
into space !

Anyway, a good day was had by all except that on the run home around 8 miles
into the journey there was a whiff of brake (you get to know what it smells
like) so back on the recovery transporter and drop off near the workshop.
The fault was traced to the flexible brake pipes one of which was only
letting fluid go one way and had finally jammed the brakes on enough to make
them smoke. Not as bas as the first time however but obviously the cause of
all my trouble. Why weren't these replaced when the rest of the work was
done ? Well they were less than 2 years old, replaced when the rest of the
pipes were renewed. So rememeber - NEW PARTS CAN FAIL ! If'I'd thought of
this I would have saved a bit of trouble.

Van came back, was tried, five miles gets the brakes slightly warm so back
it goes to have the calipper stripped and greased again. 

A 20 mile run (lots of sniffing and stopping to check the temp of the disks)
convinced us that all was OK this time. Followed by a 80 mile trip along
windy roads (plenty of brake use) and a week as my daily driver and
everything appears to be OK.

So we are back on the road and planning along trip. Fingers crossed, rescue
service (through the insurance, can't remeber the details, will post them
next week but it is well worth the money. I dont' want fixing at the
roadside, I want taking on a lorry - no tow - to someone who knows what they
are doing), idiot book and Haynes manual in the glovebox and some limited
tools in the back.
