Gentlepersons-
                       I find this difficulty quite ironic...Apparently, the 
auto manufacturers
have no diffuculty selling bloated SUV's under the rubric of &quot;light trucks&quot; 
to evade car
specs (emissions, mileage, etc.)... While a owner of a &quot;station wagon&quot; (at 
least that's
what my title says), is forced into another (more expensive), catagory.
