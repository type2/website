Hey, Its me again. I forgot to ask, does anyone know where I might locate a
77 or a 74 Westy Camper Manual? Also, I'm replacing the canvas for the
pop-up. I have a friend with a comercial sewing operation. He will help me
with construction of the replacement. If all goes well I might be able to
make a few more. Any orders? I took the old one off myself and saw that
staples are the key. What sorta staple gun is required to replace the new one?
Davooo
