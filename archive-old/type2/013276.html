&gt;i'm am in the market for aux. gauges for my 75 westy before i hit the road 

Missy:

I know you said you wanted Autometer guages, but I thought I'd pass along this link to eguages for VDO guages just in case.  I just purchased the same guages you mentioned (except they're VDO).  The prices were good and delivery was outstanding.
