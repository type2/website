After securing a spare tire from my parts westy, I left friday morning for bba, caravaning with nobody else as most of DBG was already there!  I had a wonderfully uneventful trip there.  I found out that casey, my 3 year old son is a great road companion!  We got to stop and play on two swing sets on the way dowm.  What a wonderful way to spend time.  I arrived to find the big top in full swing with everybody enjoying the HOT afternoon.  Thanks to Kurt Weber, we had an (barely) ample electrical supply, so all was running well in the tent.  I set up my tents and my new shower on the front of the bus, and went off in search of beer.  After procuring a frosty, casey and I perused the grounds to find some old friends.  I found Dennis Wilson from texas who was quick to offer a Shiner Bock.  Folks, you haven't had beer until you have had a shiner!  After some beer, Casey had a supper of crcereal in a little box, And I had some left over catfish from the gas station.  Both of us were!
 happy and full, and as it was getting dark, I tried to get Casey to go to bed.  He informed me he was staying up all night, so we just hung out under the big top.  At 12:30, Casey announced he was going to bed, and barely made it into the side tent before crashing.  Being the genius that I am, I stayed up until 4:30 am talking and putting things into the bug zapper.  Those things pack a wallop when you are barefoot!

Saturday morning dawned bright and hot and way too early.  The dbg ladies auxilliary (sorry guys!) cooked a monumental breakfast as usual, and after a little of that and a LOT of juice I was beginning to feel a little better.  Casey got up and had more cereal.  We hitched a ride in my brother Matt's black and white 67 for the cruise.  30 seconds before we are ready to leave, we get a strong whiff of fuel.  Matt looks underneath and seea a large stream of fuel.  I look quickly and determine it is only the overflow from a full tank.  We soon are underway across the beautiful Missouri countryside.  The cruise was wonderfully, quiet and uneventful.  The heat was beginning to get to me, though, so I bungeed the rear side door open.  
after the second ferry crossing, we made haste back to camp.  Wedding preperations were being made, so I went and put on my suit.  This is a gold cordouroy job I got out of a house they were tearing down.  Charlie Ford gave a wonderful sermon and the happy couple was off for their bus in a flash.

Fungus Garden Reverb took the stage for the next 5 hours or so, stopping only for the awards ceremony.  DBG cleaned house this year!  Adam won hard luck trophy, Marie Lena won best individual campsiew, Matt Soiney won most in need of resto, Chris walsh won best split, and DBG took the best group campsite trophy.  After dark, the party was in full swing, and I was hot and tired.  I retired to my shower MAtt and I built on the front of my bus.  You haven't lived until you take a shower in the middle of a wedding reception while the band is playing.  The last song played was magic bus.  

Sunday was another toughie to get up but the only thing that got done was the dismantling of about 1/2 of the big top.  Oh, and MAtt had to rebuild the broken frame horn on his car!  Sunday night we spent a lot of money playing Elvira on the jukebox.  After 10:30 the owner asked if we could quiet down though.  

Monday, we all stopped at Bill Bowman's house and then took off for WI.  Unfortunately on the way home Kim and Chuck Fryer had a trans bearing failure, and Matt lost 4th gear at the Wisconsin state line

All in all an EXCELLENT bus weeked!.  Look for our chopped, channelled, shaved, smoothed, billet, cal look, rocked powered barn door dragster!
