I sell a washable filter made by AMSOIL 100% synthetic oils.  It retails for 
19.75 plus a couple bucks shipping.  An 8 oz. bottle of foam super tack 
filter oil, for re-oiling it is 2.95.  If you are interested in synthetic 
oils you can become a distributor for $10, which obviously gives you 
everything at wholesale.  I rarely sell to retail customers (if I did I would 
post on here trying to get sales)...I use it in all my vehicles, air/oil 
filters, gear lubes, everything.  The dealer cost on the '75 air filter is 
14.75, so by selling it yourself ( if you are so inclined) is halfway paid 
for.  

Anyway I can have it sent to your house this week, I will throw in (your 
choice of one).  A bottle of re-oil, or pay shipping.

Let me know.  Or check out the AMSOIL. Com website for yourself.

have fun,
zac
