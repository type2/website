Subject: Engine rebuild in oz

Hi guys,
Just purchased a spare 2 litre engine and am pulling it appart to rebuild at
my leisure and as money is available.After hearing stories of &quot;rebuilt&quot;
engines failing quickly(and a bad experience with a Jaguar motor a few years
ago) I feel that trusting myself is the best option.
Any Australians on the list who can suggest a good cylinder head
rebuilder?(Or who I should stay away from)
Also anyone interested in buying a pair of solex carbs from this engine
complete with all manifolds,linkages,filter box,brackets, etc email me
direct.
regards
Jeff
