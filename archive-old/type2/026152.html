If I might throw something else into the pot ...
I too adjusted my timing the other day, the dwell was a bit on the high side
(more than 50 degrees), but what the heck, it runs fine.  Now Haynes says
that if your dwell varies by more than about 1% when taking the revs up to
2000, you distributor shaft is worn out.  When I did this, the dwell went
down about 6 degrees.  The timing is also erratic at higher revs but rock
steady at idle.  How bad is this for my engine?  Should I be looking for a
new distributor?
