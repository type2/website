Subject: alt light on: 911 into VW

Please forgive the cryptic subject line. Why would the alternator light go
on at idle when an otherwise good alternator is transplanted (along with its
911 engine) into a Volkswagen bus?

I compared the wiring diagram of a '71 911T with that of a '75 VW type2 and
found one difference: 1971 USA spec 911's have a diode between the
alternator light and the brake warning light. Could this be a reason for the
symptom?

Or could there be an incompatibility between Porsche alternator and VW
regulator?

TIA,

Sami
