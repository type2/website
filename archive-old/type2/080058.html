Subject: Baywindow fresh air vent sealing

Starting to reassemble the cab of my bay window after a LONG pause (paint job).

We stripped it in a day and it's taken a couple years to put it back 
together. First baby, first mortgage, new car, school, job changes....

Anyhow...

The insulation foam on the inside of the vent flapper door has deteriorated 
badly and as I remember it did not seal correctly when the bus was last 
acting as my daily driver a couple of years ago. Probably the prime reason 
I could not stay warm on a winter drive.

What sort of material are you folks replacing this with?

I am looking for something that won't hold water (rust), soft enough to 
seal to the vent opening with what little sealing force the vent lever 
offers, and found easily in the average small town.

Any suggestions?


Ciao!
