Subject: smoking distributor

[...]

hello all,

my friend has a 71, just installed a new rebuilt 1600 DP. everything was
hooked up and it ran okeh.  He then decided, (before driving it) that he
should have the transmission rebuilt.  he pulled the engine (again),  had
the transmission rebuilt and then reinstalled the whole thing again. It has
a NEW Bosch coil, distributor, and alternator. He also just installed a NEW
650 amp battery.  when he hooked up the ignition coil wire, he said he
accidentally hooked it up with the ignition wire to the minus side, and the
wire from the condenser to the plus side.  When he connected the battery got
major sparkage and the distributor had smoke coming out of it.  When he
realized his mistake he disconnected the battery.

now, he has been trying to trouble shoot it.  he took out all the fuses,
disconnected the coil, and when he tries to connect the battery he gets
MAJOR sparkage.  I thought he may have hooked the battery up backwards. He
says no! come on, I know the difference. Yeah, right.  Well tomorrow I am
heading down to San Diego to try and help him get it straightened out.  I am
planning on taking a new distributor (009).  and blue coil.  the question
is:  do you think: 1.  the distributor and/or the coil are  fried?  2. could
the ignition switch be ( history) fried as well.  Why does the battery
continue to still have major sparkage when he tries to hook it up,  with
everything disconnected?  is there a major short somewhere?
Any ideas greatly appreciated...  I will be driving a long distance,  want
to try and take everything needed to make the necessary repairs.
