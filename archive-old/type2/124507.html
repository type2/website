Subject: Re: [T2] LPG Pressure Regulator leak 

You can find replacement parts for your horizontal tank at the larger RV
parts stores (there are a ton of them online). I would not try to patch the
old part...it's just too dangerous.

Here is my suggestion (I did this before NaturalBus) go outside NOW and
empty your tank completely (and safely!!!!) using your 80% valve. It took a
pipe wrench and a breaker bar for me to get my service valve off (the part
with the handle you turn the propane on/off with). I literally had to stand
on the breaker bar to get it to budge. Once you have it off you can stop at
some of the RV stores in town or on the way to the campground and carry the
part inside with you. Use teflon tape when you put it back on. Ask them if
they will refill your tank and test it before you leave. This is assuming
you want to use your propane while camping...if not, you can do this job at
your leisure and probably get a better price.

Good luck!
