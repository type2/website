Subject: [T2] Wiring Terminals, the Endangered List

Does anybody know where to find these things?  They are the very small (about 
one eigth inch wide) brass female spade connectors used by VW in the 70s.   
If you are a Busser from that era, they were used to connect to the bulbs in 
the Gauge Cluster Panel and the Brake Test-Warning Light.  I have exhausted 
every local source from auto parts to electrical wholesalers.  These things 
must be rarer than a good presidential candidate.  Ideas?
