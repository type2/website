&gt; &gt;A problem with this kind of survey is that there are variables affecting
&gt; &gt;the validity of the data reported.
&gt;
&gt; Standard set procedure requires throwing out data that varies from the norm
&gt; beyond the stated precision. If you have ten figures between 17 and 23 and
&gt; one of 12 and another of 27, you throw out the high and low and only
&gt; mean/median/mode the rest. You use only the most normal 95% of the data or
&gt; 90% or whatever refinement the study calls for as stated precision/confidence.

I thought that the criteria for discarding data points involved
eliminating those points that do not support the researcher's argument! :)

The biggest problems with establishing mileage figures for our buses are:

too few data points
inconsistant methods of measurement
widely variable conditions

The numbers quoted in the manuals are arrived at using methods that
eliminate as many variables as possible.  Vehicles are tested on
absolutely flat circular tracks in conditions of zero wind and as close to
standard temperatures as possible.  The result is figures that are
probably higher than that achievable in normal service.  The intent is not
to decieve, just to get consistant and accurate data.
