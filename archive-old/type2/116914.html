Subject: Heater/defrost cable part number?

Corbett,

IF . . you don't find that cable NEW, I have a good USED one ($10 plus
shipping)
as I just finished parting out a '73 Westy.

I am finishing up my heater repairs and I need to replace a cable that
broke. This is for a 73 Westy. The cable is the short (15 inch?) cable that
runs from the heat/defrost lever down to the flap that it controls.


&quot;obligatory disclaimer&quot;
I am a &quot;virtual&quot; wrecking yard, selling
GOOD USED PARTS, mostly ORIGINAL STOCK.
These parts are thirty (+/-) years old,
That I pulled from a parts bus or traded...
I would use them on my buses, but they are
USED parts.    &quot;HAPPINESS GUARANTEED&quot;
