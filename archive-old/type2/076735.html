Subject: Re: Surfing bus

&gt; surfing bus...

I bought my first bus specifically as a surf access vehicle, desintation:
Baja CA. It died down there, loaded with surfboards, but my next bus has
lived much longer. I've driven it in search of surf from Mendocino CA to
south of the Tropic of Cancer in Baja Sur (and countless local trips) for
almost 10 years now.

The stories and pictures are divided between my bus page
http://www.geog.ucsb_dot_edu/~rtaylor/vw.html
and my surf page
http://www.geog.ucsb_dot_edu/~rtaylor/surf.html

Both are in need of updating, but there are some pictures of buses and
surfboards there, as well as a 7-part story about a Baja surf trip and a
number of other mentions.

Aloha,
Surfer Bob
1978 Westfalia, the surf/luvbus
