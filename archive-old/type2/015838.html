&gt;Ok, so why is there no one getting these things approved?  I mean, I 
&gt;understand the cost barriers on this, I understand the time and effort 
&gt;involved on this; but these things DO work better than a normal hose (I 
&gt;know, no proof).

Some DOT approved ones are available.  Pep Boys stocks the ones for my
Mustang.  I have some on the car now that were made by a company called
Paragon Performance (800-270-0333).  They will do custom lines but I'm not
sure if they are DOT approved.  I liked them because they have an extra
lining between the stainless and the inner teflon tube which is designed to
protect the teflon.

&gt;Factory style brake lines are DOT approved, or claim to be.  They are a 
&gt;piece of rubber with two metal fittings on them, basically.

And they worked real well too.  The problem with the teflon/stainless lines
is that they tend to fail catestrophically whereas the rubber ones usually
give you some warning (leak/plug) before failing.  I wanted firmer pedal
pressure in the Mustang, but did not notice a huge difference after
installing the stainless lines so I will probably go back to stock soon.
My bus will never have stainless lines.
