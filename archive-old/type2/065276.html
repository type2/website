Subject: Vanagon on vacation

While visiting the Stonehenge this weekend, (the replica in WA, not 
England) I shot what should turn out to be an interesting picture. From 
the center of the structure, looking out, I got a shot of a Vanagon 
Westie. It's square shape blended rather well with the towering pillars.

It'll take a couple weeks to use up the roll and get it scanned. Anyone 
want it for their page? (I thought of Thom, but it's late model.)

BTW, the van belongs to Beth Rodenhuis of WA. I chatted with her and 
Gary Haufle, when I noted their matching splittie T-shirts. They should 
be joining this feed, or that of the Vanagon, soon. 

They took a vacation to southern CA a couple weeks ago, and I think 
they said it was San Francisco where they picked up the T-shirts. 
Amazing, but their coolant tank sprung a leak on their way back, and 
they spent a couple days waiting for a replacement... in northern CA. It 
sounds like a &quot;common&quot; failure? 

They were pleasantly surprised to hear there were clubs for VWs, but did 
remark that they received plenty of friendly waves on their trip... 
already felt they were part of an unofficial club. I guess that's what 
separates Westie ownership from owning a Ford conversion van.

I'm hoping to see them on the web soon. Besides, they have a lead on a 
splittie in their home town.
