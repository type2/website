This bus is in San Francisco.

The time has come to pass on of the busses on to another that will hopefully 
love it as much as I have. This is the first bus I have ever owned and I 
have taken every single precaution I could to make it last as long as I do.

The History :
I bought it from the second owner who was using it to haul stuff once in a 
great while. He had way too many cars and the soon to be wife made him sell 
one. I got to pick from the lot, I picked the bus of course. The original 
owner was a pastor apparently. I think he mentioned them using the bus to 
transfer kids to functions and whatnot. The owner I bought it from tinted 
the windows (did a pretty good job) and added a nice new shifter knob (its 
that naked lady with her back arched you see on semi's - I really liked that 
touch) and mounted the spare on the front.

I have owned it almost a year. In this time I have done the following :
replaced :
all cv joints
hydraulic brake
EGR canister
positive batt cable
head temp sensor (1 and 2)
vacuum advance unit
rebuilt the stock distributor (75 has a few parts that are 75 only)

In addition I found new rubber for all of the floors, just like new.
I have the front rubber floor mats also.
Installed a Z-bed (see www.zproducts_dot_com)
relay for second battery
12V hookups connected to second battery
aux lights for when bus is running or not
I have the black plastic tire cover and strap that holds
it to keep it from banging around.
And there's a nice little black console that high enough to sit
between the front seats.
The kick panels are perfect, as is most all of the paneling.
I have the center seat and all the seatbelts for it as well as an
extra rear bench seat also in perfect shape.


What's wrong? :

The nose has that little bit of rust in a few spots under the windshield.
The nose is also banged up a little from the tire being mounted on there.
I don't have it mounted on there now but I have the piece if you want to put 
it back on.
The drivers side rear quarter panel has faded paint marks, and the rear 
cargo hatch has marks from some a-hole that keyed it on new years this year.
It uses oil, but a typical amount.
It idles high sometimes, someone said the linkage underneath needs to be 
adjusted. I was going to do this as the last thing before it was perfect, 
but found myself with another bus now.

What else.... its a really nice Transporter and would make a great daily 
driver. I have been driving it every day on the highway to and from work. I 
change the oil every 1500 and the oil filter every other change.
I have been using Kendall 30wt oil when possible.
The PO said the motor was rebuilt 40,000 miles ago. he did not have any 
paperwork with it though. ( I have everything on paper that I have had done)
And when you wanted it to, you could camp in it thanks to the z-bed, tinted 
windows, and extra battery to run things off of. I have taken it to Seattle 
and back with no trouble. To Bend OR recently when it was cold, ran great 
then to. It has heat that works, but my feet were still freezing. The cargo 
area heats rather well, at least the dog and passengers thought so.

I can't think of anything else right now other than to say I love this bus, 
and I hope the next owner will enjoy it as much as I have.

How much is it? :

I have invested a silly amount of money into this, but if I can sell it to 
someone from the list (or to someone that someone on the list approves of) I 
want $1500 for it.
