Subject: I should quality for the Darwin Award!

I've not posted for a white, so I thought I'd best give everyone an 
update on my rag-tag fleet of VW's...

- --- '57 Bus ---

The '57 23 is being my little trauma case.  Sort of like that child 
that gets upset when you bring home a new child (The oval).  

Well, it's actaully my fault...  The battery died, and so I threw the 
charger on it while still in the car.  Bad move.  I managed to fry my 
cd-player and other valuable instruments.  I don't know why... but 
anyway.  So I took the battery OUT and charged it.  Well I put it in 
BACKWARDS!!!  (Where's old Charles Darwin?).  Well THE BUS WORKED!!!  
Yes, it did.  I lie not.  But it discharged real fast and I figured 
something was up when I went to jump start it and sparks went a flyin 
when I put the jumper cables on it.  So I checked it, and sure enough 
it was in backwards.  

Now don't discount me as a total idiot.  The evil PO put in a red 
groundstrap and a black positive strap!  Now of course I new this, 
but apparently wasn't thinking when I put the battery in, and just 
did the natural thing by putting red on + and black on -...  OOOPS!

Well, I fried the generator it looks like...  I replaced the voltage 
reducer, and no fixo, so I put the voltmeter on the generator and 
it's putting out about 10-11v....  Oh well.

Anyhow, a local guru says the engine has to come out because I have 
the doghouse cooler and there's no way to do it easy.

Any comments?  Any thing else I can try before pulling th eengine?


- --- '56 Oval ---

I bought the '56 oval bug back in the beginning of August, and it's 
been performing great.  After the initial work-in of the 2020cc 
engine, it's running much smoother.  It's still too loud though... :)

I've been having fits with one small detail.  The pin in the 
driver side door hinge has the fitting for the mirror broken off.  
Well needless to say it's been an adventure trying to get it out.  
After hours of pouinding, prying, etc., I abandoned it and decided 
the only way would be do drill it out.  So I tried a normal drill 
bit.  That was a joke...  I bought a cobalt drill bit and an hour 
later I was through the 3&quot; of steel of the pin.  All is well?  No 
way.  The bit was too small (I had used a 1/4in).  So I tried a larger
bit 19/64ths (which matches the size of the pin).  My normal steel bit 
just fell apart.  I bought a black oxide bit and it lasted about 30 
seconds and dulled.  So I'll try anoter cobalt bit, and I'll get a 
metal file just in case.  (The problem is that only the edges of the 
bit hit metal and they just bend when you put any pressure on the 
drill).

- --- '59 Singlecab ---

Well I just committed myself and money to get it going.  I had the 
bodywork guy come haul the singlecab off to work on it.  I'm not 
going to to a perfect resto, just a remove-all-rust-and-bondo-and-
paint it job.  It has had the wheel wells cut out, and the wrong ones 
put back in (60's lipped ones instead of the old style).  I'm buying 
my friends engine and tranny since he's getting a spiffed up one for 
his '64 bus.

So that's all from this end for right now.  Any words of advice 
welcome!
