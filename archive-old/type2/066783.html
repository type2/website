Subject: RE: request for advice:  should I keep the Jetta too?

Keep the bus, lose the Jetta.  The Jetta's old and will be a money sink forever.
 The best thing about the Jetta is driving it hard on winding mountain roads,
but I do that in my '64 Camper, just slowly uphill and as fast as most other
cars downhill, yeah, I know I am a little crazy, but I get a thrill feeling the
inside, rear wheel lift of the groung :)

If you become unemployed, the bus can keep give you shelter, the Jetta will die
when it realizes you can no longer buy it that premium gas.

Happy Friday (errrr, Thursday),
