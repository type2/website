Subject: Re: [T2] engine ID ? help?

Hi Lukas,

&gt; I was told by the PO that my Van had an exchange engine and I am
&gt; trying to work out what year model it is and whether that is true.
&gt; The van No is: 2292080102
&gt; and the engine No is: CJ019599X
&gt; It was first registerd in Germnay in January 1979 as a 2L model.
&gt; Am I looking at a 1978 or true 1979 and what is the difference?

It is a 1979 model. here's an explanation of the VIN:

2292 080 102	: 22 = microbus
		: 9  = 1979 model
		: 2  = this numbr means nothing, it's always a &quot;2&quot; for some reason
		: 080102 = It's the 080102nd bus produced for modelyear 1979.

I guess your bus was made in dec-78 or jan-79 as the registration of
vehicles goes pretty fast in Germany. Two weeks after they have left the
factory they are already registered and driving around.

As for your engine: CJ is the original type of 2L engine used on the T2
in those days. But the number says it is from model year 1976, probably
april 1976 or so (wow, I'm also from april'76). There's another way of
telling this is not the original engine. The number has an &quot;X&quot; stamped
behind it, this means it is a revised engine. Also there should be a
VW-logo with arrows around it stamped beside it, like a recycling logo.

Here's some T2-engine number info:

&gt; THe next question will be which heat exchangers I will need. but that
&gt; is a totally different story. Trying to get hold of  original quality
&gt; ones in Germany or the UK..

That's hard. I saw a german guy at VWEuro two years ago, he asked $
150,- for one heat exchanger which wasn't very expensive I think, but
that's the only I guy I've seen so far selling them. There are a lot of
different types so be sure to buy the right ones.
