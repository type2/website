Subject: Dual port engines

This may seem silly to some, but anyways...

I understand, and have worked on engines for a while now, but have never
worked on a dual port engine.  Although my motorcycle has 16 valves, I've
never taken it apart.  Can someone fill me in on the theory and timing
behind these new fangled wonders?
