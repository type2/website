Subject: Re: [T2] Has anyone installed a BA4 up front on a Vanagon?

 [...]

??  Your subject title says BA4. But your 1st paragraph says BA6. Then you say
BA4 in the 2nd paragraph......

BIG difference in size between a 4 and a 6 :)
No, you cannot fit a BA6 in the front.



&gt; This thread has me thinking. There is a big space up front
&gt; on air cooled Vanagons. Would you be able to fit a BA6 up
&gt; there?
&gt;
&gt; I will have BEHR front AC shortly and the evaporator will be
&gt; behind the front grille, so it will have to cohabitate with
&gt; the BA4.
