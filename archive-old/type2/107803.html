Subject: To much Oil Pressure??

Hey folks
              My T4 converted to upright, with 20/50 straight oil is running
at 60 lbs oil pressure.  Is this to much?  Of course if so what do I look for
causing it?

                Also: Does a bit of Oil push through the pushrod tubes?  When
I give it gas something is spraying oil on the header on the right side.  I
can see it cooking off the header.  Just seem to be very slight at idle but
when I rev it up it hits the exhaust and smokes off.  I can't seem to tell
where it's coming from.

Dave
