Subject: Finding brake booster vacuum hose

Hi All,
    There's been some talk on the vacuum hose for the brake booster
lately.  When I had the engine out of our bus a couple of years ago I
decided that I'd replace the hose.  Another list member recommended I
look for 15/32 vacuum hose.  I tried all the local FLAPS with no luck,
none of them had vacuum hose that large and several suggested I use
heater hose.  I finally found it at a parts place that caters to
trucks.  When I asked for 15/32 vacuum hose all they asked was how
much of it did I want.  Talking to the counter man I found out that
15/32 was far from the largest vacuum hose they had.
    So if you are having trouble finding vacuum hose that big I
suggest you try a truck parts FLAPS.
