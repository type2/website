&gt; Hi Guys,
&gt; 
&gt; My bus has been running like sh** lately. Hard to start, idles rough, etc. I decided to do a compression test. Last time I did this I had two at 130 and two at 90. This time, the highest cylinder was 80 and the rest were lower. At 25 psi on one cylinder, it's not surprising it runs rough. What IS surprising is that it will still to 75 mph on a flat surface ;-)
&gt; 
&gt; Anyway, I'm getting myself committed to the big cash outlay for the new motor and I'm also thinking of putting in a new transmission while everything is apart. The transmission I have now works fine, doesn't pop out of gear, it's just noisy and a little fussy about reverse. Does this make sense or am I going to be disappointed with the quality of the rebuilt trans? I hear of rebuilt ones popping out of gear and being a PITA. If I go the rebuilt trans route, I want the new one to perform better than my current one.
&gt; 
&gt; I am thinking about getting an AVP motor and Rancho trans through Bus Depot. Any comments, suggestions or things to watch out for?
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks much!
