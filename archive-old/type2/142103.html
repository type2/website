Subject: Lifespan of a full flowed type 1 in a bus

I can think of no reason why a well built type 1 motor would not get 100K with or 
without the filter. They did originally anyway. (stock set-up, no idea on oversize 
motors).
I would guess even a new Mex/Brazil motor would do that out of the box?? (I have one, 
but have yet to use it)
As for bearings, type 1 motors suffer from the case deforming under load as much as 
bearing wear, that's why 1300TP motors are sought after for re-building.

&gt; I had to rebuild an engine at 60,000 miles because I put off the
&gt; valve 
&gt; job that I knew I needed to do before that and I dropped a valve. I have never seen 
rod bearings come out of a VW engine that
&gt; looked 
&gt; as good as those. I put them back on the crank with plastiguage to
&gt; get 
&gt; the real story and they checked good to the *new* bearing specs. I
&gt; don't 
&gt; see why a VW bottom end wouldn't go at least 100K miles with a full
&gt; flow 
&gt; filter.
