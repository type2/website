&gt; So, aimed the strobe where I thought the timing mark should be, and

&gt; hose on&quot;.  But I have an early '76, with vacuum advance *and* retard,
&gt; so the &quot;75 with FI - 5 ATDC, vacuum hose(s) on&quot; entry in the table
&gt; seems a better match.  This is frustrating, because there is not a &quot;76
&gt; with FI - ... hoses(s) on&quot; entry in the table, and so none that exactly
&gt; match my engine.

Bentley is wrong. Stan Wolfarth knows about many of goofs in the current
edition thankfully.

Jim Thompson has the correct info:

&gt; I believe that 5 ATDC is the correct timing spec for this distributor,
&gt; since it has the vacuum retard that is going to be engaged at idle.
&gt; That is what I set it to today, going on the assumption that retarded
&gt; timing is less damaging than too-advanced timing.  I then took it for a
&gt; spin along CA-1 from San Francisco down to Half Moon Bay and back (with
&gt; an espresso break in between :-), and it ran great... maybe a little
&gt; sluggish on hills, but then again, those heavy Westies are always like
&gt; that.

Sounds like you go it.
