Hi Robert,

Just go to the library and check out a textbook on automotive engineering
and design...something I guarantee your &quot;pretty competent VW mechanics&quot; have
never done, or they would not be telling you such hogwash.  I'd bet VW
engineers also have slightly more education than your average &quot;specialist&quot;.

Ford Motor Co. published a textbook in the '50's that concluded; 90% of all
engine wear occurs in the first 10 minutes of operation.  Extensive testing
with wear sensors in every conceivable part of the engine showed near
immeasurable wear at 180 degree F oil temp with full flow filtering.

I've never heard of any modern factory installed automotive engine that
ships without a thermostat.  Parts left out cost the manufacturer no money
and cause no maintenance worry, so they must be putting them in there for a
reason and it's not because they like throwing away millions of dollars.

Common sense tells you why you need a thermostat if you just investigate
from reliable sources.  If nothing else and without informed study, it's
reasonable to conclude that a thermostat on an A/C VW allows the dissimilar
metals of cast iron and aluminum to achieve relatively uniform expansion
rates during warm-up so case to cylinder/cylinder to head leaks are
minimized.

It's all about that first ten minutes if you want your engine to laaaaaast.

Steve Trembley

Question 1.) Does a type I thermostat have the same range of motion as a
type IV?  This would be good, if I am to substitute one for the other.

Question 2.) I've seen a number of responses on this list over the years
along the lines of Steve Trembley's &lt;stevet_at_whidbey_dot_com&gt; recent comment:
