hi and welcome to the funny farm

&gt; birthday/mother's day present.  She needs some new cv 
&gt; joints and we are planning on replacing them as soon 

there are a couple places that have these parts and the folks are on the
list here and some give discounts,   check BustedBus, Bus Depot, and a few
others that escape my mind at the moment.

&gt; as we can.  The bus has been in some type of accident 
&gt; the previous owner didn't know what happened to it.  

try to find out more info if you can.

&gt; We already bought the sideview mirrors, so as soon as 
&gt; the cv's have been replaced the kids and I can head to 
&gt; the beach and other places!  I am so excited!  We all 

well before heading out to the beach can I suggest a few other things to
do before heading to the beach so you can enjoy the drive

.  change all the fuel lines, they are 24 years old.
.  change the fuel filter
.  change the oil and oil filter
.  check your brakes and brake lines.  
.  give her a tune up.
.  check your tires  (they should be rated with a weight capacity of at
least 1480 lbs) many folks have put under rated tires on the buses 
.  practice driving it, it is slightly different since in effect your
sitting on the front bumper, over the front wheels. it's a heavy vehicle
and it doesn't stop on a dime either.

&gt; are actually.  My bus is white but we want to repaint 
&gt; it eventually maybe a blue.  The man we bought it from 
&gt; was going to paint it like the Mystery Machine for his 
&gt; girls so he gave us the scooby doo curtains, but we 
&gt; need to get some rods.  LOL  We paid $700 for her, and 
&gt; like I said I think that once the cv joints are 

sounds like you got a good price if the engine is in good shape,  you
rarely have to change all 4 CV joints usually only one goes bad at a
time.  they are a tad pricy.  it is a simple ( but very dirty) do it
yourself job.

&gt; replaced we can drive it without having to worry too 
&gt; much.  Of course we will work on it each payday to get 

first thing get an &quot;official service manual&quot; usually reffered to on the
list here as the &quot;Bentley&quot; since it was written by Robert Bentley co.  

&gt; her in better condition!  Anyway, I am glad to be 
&gt; here.  

welcome and enjoy,  where are you located?
