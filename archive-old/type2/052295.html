Subject: Re: [T2] Whatzit Week 4 - ANSWER ME THIS

As the answer is now up, I assume this is over and I have a
real question indirectly involving this part.

Like Steve says, present on '78 and '79 Bus.  Now the flapper
valve this thing hooks to is different of course.  Where a regular
flapper has that littler mushroom thingie on top where the heat
vents, the ones for this have a hood like thing with a 2&quot; outlet
then 2&quot; corrugated paper/foil tube just like from the heater blower
ran down to this &quot;exhaust&quot; pipe which hangs below the frame
rail on both sides attached to the motor mount.  Now for my
question.

My '82 Vanagon has flapper valves which are clearly van flappers
(different from bus subtlely) that has the hoods like it should
have tubes and exhaust the heat.  BUT it doesn't have the tubes.
Now the bus did have an engine install when I got it but is low
mile and real complete, so I'm wondering if anyone has ever
seen one of those tubes on a '82 or '83.  I know my '81 which came
with original engine did not have them and does not have the
flapper valves for them either.  So it looks like one of those things
VW could never make up their mind about.  If anyone has them
on a Vanagon, I'd love a digital pic of their installation.  These
would of course not mount on a vanagons motor mount, so they
would  be different if they exist.  FWIW I don't think any of this
stuff ever apears on the Bus fiche and the flappers to use with
them certainly are not and maybe never were available as spares.
If you got them and the flappers rust away you lose the feature.
