 some panels just need to be replaced, and not patched... rockers on

&gt;the only catalog I have with panels in it is JC Whitney... I know a lot
&gt;of people have bad stories about them, but I've never really had a
&gt;problem...


I posted a similar request a week or so back, and all replies but one
said to go with parts from Das Bulli Haus, which you can access from
Thom Fitzpatricks web page.    One person said Rocky Mountain Motor
Works was great to work with, but that parts didn't fit esp.  well.  From
my browsing I know that JCW's prices are only a little lower than
RMMW's and I'd be leery of buying body panels from them.  As for
Das Bulli Haus, I emailed a request for a parts list, so we'll see.
