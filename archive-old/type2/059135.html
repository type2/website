Subject: Trouble along the way... Part 4:  Autopsy and (soon, I hope) 
	resurrection

This is a compilation of edited excerpts from several follow-up messages to 
Jim Arnott and Pat Owen, Union OR. 
------------------------------------------------------------------
The short answer is -- the #3 piston has a hole in it (surprise, surprise!!).

The hole is on the &quot;under&quot; side of the piston, above the top ring land and 
extending just a tad over the edge into the rim of the piston crown.  Looking 
at the piston held vertically in your hand, the hole is a couple of inches 
from side to side.  There's quite a bit of missing metal, some of which is 
smeared/welded to the adjacent surface of the cylinder bore.

This is clearly a heat-related failure.  The question is, how in blazes did 
that piston get hot enough to melt without the rest of the engine also showing 
some sign of excessive heat?
****************************************
After the engine builder adjusted the valves and changed the oil following the 
initial break-in period, he plugged in his ancient (and un-certified) emission 
test gear.  He didn't like the numbers, even though they matched those 
obtained by the State's test gear last Winter when the rig barely squeaked by, 
and he wanted a richer mixture off idle.  I rebuilt the carb with a bigger 
main jet, he re-tested, and gave the go-ahead for highway travel.

When I removed the carb for rebuild the rear nut wasn't even finger tight and 
the front nut was just snug but not tight.  No washers on either mounting 
stud.  The carb could be rocked fore and aft because it was so loose on the 
manifold.  In the quest for possible lean mixture sources, this seems like an 
awfully good candidate.

When I was re-installing the carb I checked dwell and timing as I always do 
before adjusting the carb.  Something just wasn't right, and then I realized 
the pulley was different.  It'd been replaced with a new pulley, carrying 3 
marks, and it was timed to 5 degrees ATDC.  They'd even put a paint mark at 
that notch.  After checking the specs on Jim Thompson's site I determined that 
the big deep middle mark really was TDC, where a '70 1600SP should be timed 
with stock induction and ignition systems.  The 3 marks clearly represented 5* 
ATDC, TDC, and 7.5* BTDC.  I retimed to TDC and the engine got a lot happier 
right away.

I believe that the heat damage to #3 was done in that fateful (and fatal?) 
first 500 miles before the carb was properly installed and the timing properly 
set.  The die was cast, so to speak, and the subsequent piston failure was 
just a matter of time.  
*****************************************
Some piston alloy metal was in the crankcase, mostly pretty small chips and 
slag-like material.  The crankcase, crankshaft, cam, bearings, etc. appear 
unscathed.  

This was my first look at the inside of this case, and it really does look 
brand new.  I don't know if the AK cases are the later alloy, as found in the 
new Mexican engines,  but this looked like an aluminum casting inside.  
Reminded me of the machined aluminum parts I used to work with at Boeing years 
ago.

The #3 rod has a fair-sized chunk of piston alloy fused to it on what was the 
&quot;down&quot; side of the wrist pin boss, and the wrist pin shows some slight scoring 
and discoloration.  The bushing is just the tiniest bit loose on the wrist 
pin.  To his credit the builder is replacing the full set of rods with new 
parts.

A full set of new pistons and cylinders is also going in.  

The heads appear undamaged, but will be disassembled for inspection and 
service if needed.  Frankly, if I were doing the job I'd probably use the 
heads as is.  There's no indication of any defect or damage from the recent 
trauma.
****************************************

Thus endeth the saga of a lonely Listee and his misadventures with his beloved 
Campmobile.  From time to time others on the Lists have jokingly (I think) 
suggested carrying a spare engine as part of the dedicated onboard spares 
supply.  They may be onto something there.....

It could have been worse, and I did get to spend a night in the bus for the 
first time in over a year.  I'd never heard of a &quot;Pilot Travel Center&quot; before, 
but they were certainly helpful and sympathetic to my situation.  Their 
enormous complex includes an RV park, but they suggested I use the employee's 
parking area for free.  I'll be back under (I hope) more pleasant 
circumstances.

Stay tuned to this station for the next episode.  It ain't REALLY over until 
the new engine &quot;sings&quot;.....
