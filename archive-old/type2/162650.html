&gt; I'm trying to replace the accelerator cable on my auto 77 westy.  I'm
&gt; having trouble finding the linkage on the transmission. Does anyone have
&gt; any pics or could anyone help me out? Where should I look? I know I've
&gt; seen it before (when I took the cable off originally (1.5 yrs ago), but


on the underside looking up on the passenger side (lft hand drive) about
two thirds the way to the front there will be a lever about 6 inches long
sticking up, just above the pivot point there will be a ball, press the
cup part of the accell linkage over the ball, put some light grease or
lube like 90weight oil in the cup before pressing it on.

hope this helps
Bob
