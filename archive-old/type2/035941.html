&lt;&lt;  have a feeling that if everyone helped by Karl (in hard parts or
 irreplaceable advice) pitched in $10 or $20, we could easily buy him that
 '78 that someone mentioned.
 
 FYI, I owe Karl about $100 or more if I think about the *value* of parts
 he's sent at cost...and another 3 billion pesos or so for the value of
 information.
 
 Same holds true for John Anderson and others.
 
 Thanks! Joe

Karl has helped me numerous times.  Count me in if you get something going.
