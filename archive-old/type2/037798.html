NO IT WONT!

Sorry to shout but i hate to see wrong information.  68-69 beams have a
different mounitng pattern than 70-79.

But if you want disc brakes the torsion arms &amp; spindles from the 71 beam
can be mated to the 68 beam... that will give you disks. I'd suggest
changing out the rear to the 71 stuff as well so you dont have to carry
spares with 2 different bolt patterns.
