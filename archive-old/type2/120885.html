It looks like a custom one off but I'm not certain. Can anyone with
fiberglass experience give an idea of how much work it would take to create
something like this for the baywindow?


well it's quite easy but time consuming I'm doing one right now to my bay by
modifying the original dash  I'm using 2&quot; conduit for my gauges and
relocating my radio underneath  on applying the fiberglass you do it in
sections let it dry sand then apply another piece sand so on and so forth it
s done a lot in the custom truck scene it take along time

Later
