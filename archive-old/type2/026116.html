I like these sweeping generalisations :-)
There was nothing wrong with the German fuel lines that VW put on in the
factory.  Any fuel line will go brittle with age.
The hose that you get now is internally reinforced (the cloth is
sandwiched inside instead of being wrapped round the outside).  One
advantage of this I can see is that you can tell if the hose is cracked.
I think the correct size is 5.5mm ID, they should be a good tight fit
before you put the clamps on.
One other thing, next time you disconnect your battery, take the
NEGATIVE wire off.  (And the positive as well if you're really paranoid,
but just the negative is fine.)

&gt; -----Original Message-----
&gt; I had a good warm day last week. With very little fuel in the tank and
&gt; the
&gt; positive (+) side of the battery disconnected and a fire extinguisher
&gt; near
&gt; by, I went to work. I don't know how old the lines were but they
&gt; looked
&gt; fine. I pulled on the line to the fuel pump and it tore off. They were
&gt; the
&gt; German cloth lines and were not clamped at the carbs where they came
&gt; off
&gt; too easily. Whenever I have had fuel lines fail or break in my hands
&gt; it has
&gt; been those cloth wound fuel lines. They seem to dissolve and become
&gt; brittle with age but they remain flexible and look just fine. They
&gt; also
&gt; tend to crack on the ends. In my opinion the regular (non-German) fuel
&gt; line
&gt; seems to hold up much better. On the oldest junk busses I've looked at
&gt; and
&gt; taken parts off of, those regular fuel lines seem to hold up better
&gt; over
&gt; time.
