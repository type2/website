Hi all,

I'm trying to score a Brake Servo (vacuum assist) for my '72 Camper and need
some help. Apparently there are two types used- ATE and Bendix. VW Sweden says
that ATE was used up to Chassis Nr 214 2110 465 and Bendix from  466 and up. My
chassis number is 222 2132 755 which should indicate a bendix. Thus, logic
dictates that all year models over mine would also be Bendix equipped. Yet when
trying to get the part I find that 75s,76s, etc also have ATE installed. So
much for logic...

Can somebody shed some light on this?  1. What is the correct type for my
bus/year? 2. How do you tell Bendix from ATE? Mine has no visible markings. 3.
Are the damn things simply interchangeable?  4. Can the installed servo be
rebuilt? 5. Any other wisdom on this? 

It's camping season over here and we're stuck... :-(

Thanks in advance and please copy to my p-mail if possible.

P.S. The actual problem with the bus is: When I step on the brakes the pedal
stays down with brakes applied. Had this once before and it was a rusted out
servo that was the problem. Had a '72 parts bus then...
