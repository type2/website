Mmmm, bloody VW fuel injection!
Most mechanics I've spoken to give it the heave ho
pretty early on &amp; 2 of my good friends dumped it for
carbs: 1 got Webers &amp; the other standard Solexs.
I think the general consensus here in Australia is
that fuel injection was something that VW got wrong.
:-)
