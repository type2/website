Subject: Using a Westfalia Icebox

This may seem like an elementary question but.........

I have been thinking about the functionality of the Westy icebox unit 
in the 68 to 73 campers. Please share you experiences and ideas for 
making it work. What works best:dry ice, dry ice, frozen ziplock bags 
of ice, use the ice box for dry storage :) ?

BTW, many folks just remove theirs and perhaps for good reason but I 
want to make a go of it.

Thanks
