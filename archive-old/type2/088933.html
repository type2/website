Subject: Re: [T2] places to stow stuff

[...]

76 to 79 cot bars are 2 piece collapsible because of where they store. Under
the 3/4 bench seat in the half moon cut-outs. Where you found yours is the
correct place.
The table leg fits under there with no problems.


&gt; While going through the interior of my 'new' 79 Westy
&gt; a couple weeks ago, I happily discovered the original
&gt; child's cot and poles cozily stowed in a little notch
&gt; in the footlocker under the rear seat/bed.
&gt;
&gt; It looks like it was designed to be stowed there.  Or
&gt; is it?  In my '69 Westy, the child's cot is stowed (I
&gt; believe) in the long flat area on top of the coat
&gt; closet.
&gt;
&gt; I can't figure out, however, where the big L-shaped
&gt; table leg (in the '79) goes when not in use.
&gt; Westfaliawerks designed the table to be strapped down
&gt; in the rear cargo area, so I assume there must be a
&gt; logical place somewhere for the table leg, right?
&gt; Maybe it goes where I found the cot and the cot goes,
&gt; once again, above the closet?
