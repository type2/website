don't get made at me but my brother-in-law (idiot owns a Camaro and he
complains about me working on my bus all the time talk about un-reliable)
says the best tool for a VW owner is a couple of extra rubber bands incase
the motor breaks.  I told him we just use those to keep the curtains
together when the strap shrinks form old age and won't snap around them
anymore.
