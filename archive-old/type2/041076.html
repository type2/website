Hi Volks!

&gt; my wife was looking at my life line yesterday, she saw something in a
&gt; magazine about it, anyway she pointed out to me that the lines in my hands
&gt; make a  VW  symbol. does anybody else have that?

Me.  Size of a small coin, in the centre of my left palm 
(which is cool, me being a southpaw).  Thanks for making
me look -- I'll have to scan my hand sometime :-)

Doesn't seem to be that unusual though -- all it takes
is two pairs of parallels crossing each other, which
in my limited experience they do on most folks' palms.
Still, it's neat to have.

Airhowlingly yours, 
   Erik.
