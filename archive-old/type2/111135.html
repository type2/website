Subject: Wax coating on propane tank???

Hello List,

I bought a propane tank from an 81 Westy a few weeks
ago. The tank was covered in a thick layer of dust and
dirt so I took some detergent and a scrub brush and
started cleaning. While cleaning it I noticed that the
light grey tank was covered with what appears to be
brown wax. Is this from the factory? Does anyone know
what I am refering to? Can you still buy this coating?
It is wearing thin in spots and I would like to put
another coat on it. It is quite ulgy but It seems to
work. There is almost no surface rust on the tank at
all! I will probably just make a dimond plate shield
to to cover the front of the tank once I install it
that will match my diamond plate side step. 

Thanks!

David Kelly
