Subject: Re: [T2] US spec vs. Euro

[...]

Huh??? Before more BS gets thrown around over this. Whoa!
The original postee that asked this question lives in the US and has a 78 bus,
if you had read all the way to the bottom of his post.
Here is his info:
Richard
1978 Westfalia CDN
Austin, TX

ALL USA spec buses from 72 up with the long taillight is Amber on top, Red in
the middle, White on the bottom.
Here is a pic of a 78 bus from the 78 factory brochure:
http://webpages.charter_dot_net/bclausen/78Bus/bus4.jpg

Here is the spec page from that brochure:
http://webpages.charter_dot_net/bclausen/78Bus/bus12.jpg
Stamped on the bottom is the dealer it came from in Fairfax, Virginia. And if
you read the * it says 'based on 1978 EPA....'
so it is a USA brochure.

&gt; Euro specs tailights have amber on them, US don't.
&gt; For example my '69 bus is swiss market specs and the tailights are
&gt; amber/red white US specs are
&gt; solid red. Models after 71 are amber/red/white for Euro, red/red/white for
&gt; US specs. Turn signals are
&gt; at the top of the housing.
&gt; Hope it helps,
&gt;

&gt; &gt;Richard - thought you had it right....
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Can someone clear up some confusion for me?
&gt; &gt;&gt;Is the general consensus inthe bus community when ordering
&gt; &gt;&gt;parts is that the Euro spec tail lenses are red/amber/white
&gt; &gt;&gt;and the US spec tail lenses are red/red/white?  Or is this backwards?
