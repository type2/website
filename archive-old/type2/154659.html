Subject: Re: [T2] Wire harness

They send me BOTH a VW catalog and a Corvette catalog.  I called them about 
3 years ago and told them that i did not have Corvette, yet the catalog 
keeps a comin.........

My local ACVW shop thinks their catalogs also keep up with the price 
increases..as a all of us know, the price  since Mexico stopped making 
Beetles in Puerta have gone nothing but up.
