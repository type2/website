Subject: [T2] LONG LIVE JOHN MUIR!!

Mechanically, I am a MORON! I was having a starting problem on my 75 bus and used Muir's &quot;How to Keep your VW Alive&quot; book and followed his directions for checking the whole ignition system and VOILA! Using his easy to follow instructions, I found my problem,apparently an old &quot;dirty or rusty solenoid&quot; and fixed it temporarily (thank you Mr. Ball Peen Hammer).  My 2 questions is this: 1)How long can I expect to continue with the solenoid in this shape? It starts fine every time right now, and Muir says that you may be able to &quot;go some time&quot; before you have to replace the parts.  But does anyone have a concrete example of how they had the same problem and continued to drive their bus for years, months, weeks, days...before it actually gave up the ghost?? and 2)When the day finaly comes, and the hammer fails, Do you have to replace\repair BOTH the solenoid and starter or is it possible to deal only with the solenoid?  Thanks for the help!!
