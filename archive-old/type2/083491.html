Regarding tailgating:

Why not rig up a tray under the battery compartments into which you put
old parts that have no further use.  When you pull a cable the rear edge
of the tray is released and your old bits drop to the roadway as a gentle
reminder that it's not a good idea to tailgate behind a bus!
