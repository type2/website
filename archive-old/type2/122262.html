Subject: Phone # update, Urgent tranny problem

This is just an update.  I have begun trying to drop my engine. Have 
questions about removing excellerator cable and fuel line/injecter. I don't 
have easy acess to the internet. The phone number for the hotel that I will 
be staying at for the next few days is 843-538-3600 and I am in room 141.  
Thanks so much for any help,

Kyle La Ferriere
