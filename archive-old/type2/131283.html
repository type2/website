In the gaskets pic, notice the ones I was given at DIPS are on the left. The
one on the right came off my bus.

That cut picture... I was stunned when I saw that cut on the flange. I
couldn't for the life of me figure out what the PO was trying to accomplish
with that. I filled it on both sides (inside and outside) with JBWeld. I
figured the two sides meeting inside that cut would seal it pretty nicely.
