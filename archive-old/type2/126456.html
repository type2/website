Subject: Friday Odd Thoughts

Why is it that so many bus's are sold with the engine out? I was just
browsing through the Samba listings (like I have any $$) and noticed a
trend... Then I thought about it and realized my first bus, a 69, came
without its engine installed too.

Is it just me or is there a reason for this?
