Subject: Diesel oil

I know oil choice is old news, but as my archive search came up empty, 
this should be a new question.

A friend once idly mentioned using diesel oil in his bug-engine splitty 
(it was a 1200 I think). As diesel engines run hotter then petrol, this 
sound like a good move, but is it? I am very tempted by a special offer 
at my local store on Castrol Magnatec Diesel -( normally 30 pounds for 5 
litres (what is that - about 55 dollars?, so not a cheap product)
