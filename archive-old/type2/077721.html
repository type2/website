&gt; Direct experience with Split fire plugs. Lotus turbo comes in running poor.
&gt; Pull plugs= split fires with less than 1000 miles on them had cracked
&gt; insulators. Stock plugs fixed all problems.

Physics interpretation of splitfire &quot;technology&quot;:

To build up large spark voltages, you want flat smooth electrodes.  If
you want to discharge the spark prematurely before it can build up install
a plug with sharp edges can corners like a splitfire.

Current will take the path of least resistance.  Therefore it will always
create one spark per discharge.  The &quot;multispark&quot; photographs you see of
splitfire (and other) plugs are exposures of several discharges.

For Kettering ignitions, use the stock low-cost plugs made by a quality
manufacturer like Bosch or NGK.  Avoid exotics like platinum and snake
oil like splitfire
