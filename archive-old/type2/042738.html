&lt;&lt; We installed a sump oil temp sender and gauge and it reads no higher than
 180 on the highway. We read that these senders tend to run on the low side
 which makes sense because the engine seems to get up to normal temperature
 (feeling the dipstick). Any comments on this?

My 63 dormobile has a drain plug temp sender, I've gotten it up to about 240 
before.
