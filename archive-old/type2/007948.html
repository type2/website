&gt; Hi Volks!
&gt; 
&gt;     I'm new to the list, I recently bought a 1979 transporter(with
&gt; 2.0l/FI), and I'm looking for a owners manuel for it, does anyone have
&gt; one laying around, that you would part with. Also can anyone recommend
&gt; any books on just the 1968-1979 buses(please give title, author, and
if
&gt; possible ISBN#).  
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks!

-have you looked into &quot;how to keep your volkswagen  alive- a manual of
step by step procedures for the compleat idiot&quot; by john muir? 
he is the shiznik when it comes to vw's.
i'd bet everyone here has heard of it if they don't already sleep with
a dog-eared copy under their pillow every night!
