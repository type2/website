Subject: Re: [T2] Re: Unknown Dist - Final, look at it and comment, please! (fwd)

Just a quick clarification; Retarded timing does NOT result in a cooler
running engine (it makes it hotter). Combustion speed increases with engine
temperature, so retarded timing results &quot;in the same timing the cylinder
sees&quot; on a hot engine. Close, but very different. This is why VW retarded #3
on in-shroud cooler engines, not to cool #3, but to keep it from detonating
(it has a faster ignition speed because of the higher temps).
