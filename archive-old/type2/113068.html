Subject: Re: [T2] cooling deflectors question

[..]

Paul, this is kinda reverse of the &quot;flaps in the heater fan blower
motor&quot; question that came up earlier this week.  You need the flaps to
which you refer because at idle, when the heater is on, the heater fan
is pushing more air at this &quot;point&quot; in the fan shroud than the fan for
the engine cooling.  The air that the heater fan is pushing is HOT and
coming off the heat exchangers.  The flaps keep this hot air from coming
back into the engine fan at idle.  Once you rev the engine up, the
engine cooling fan overpowers the heater blower fan and forces the flaps
open and pushes all the heated air toward the front of the bus.  If you
listen carefully, you can hear those little flaps &quot;slam&quot; shut at idle
when the heater is turned on.  Greg
