Subject: [T2]Re: Installing front shocks

Richard;
   I've encountered a similar issue with shocks on Bugs. Make sure that
the sleeve on the original shock left with the shock. I was puzzled as
heck when I was trying to install KYB's on the front end of my '69 Bug.
Bushings just wouldn't make it over the shock mounting bolts. Hmmmm?!?!
   Turns out the bushings from the original shocks were pretty much
*one* with the shock mount. It took a liberal amount of Kroil and some
vigorous action with an air chisel to pop the 30+ year old bushings free
from the mounts. (This car had the original shocks, minus any *shock*
ability when I bought it.)
   I don't know if this is what ails your beast, but take a really close
look at what you have.

&gt; Hi,
&gt; 
&gt; I'm replacing the OE front shocks on my camper with KYB gas-a-just's and
I
&gt; noticed that the metal sleeve isn't the same size.
