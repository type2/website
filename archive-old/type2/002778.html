Volks,

In an effort to conserve bandwidth (and sanity), I'll herewith combine a
number of technical questions:

Brief background: 78 Westy, one-week old top-end rebuild; all new FI,
clutch, pressure plate.  Installed new CD deck and speakers yesterday.

1 - I know I have hydraulic valves.  They're new; sodium-filled.  I swear I
hear loose valves (thanks to www.volks_dot_net) on the left head... on a
brand-new
top-end rebuild, can they need adjustment?  I must admit the sound is an
awful lot like an exhaust leak... I was first terrified when I listened to
John Muir's &quot;bad cam&quot; cut - mine also goes away as RPMs increase.  But,
naaaaah.  The valve .ram was a closer match.
2 - My left turn signal stopped working yesterday.  Tonight on the way home
from Wally's World, I tried (briefly!) to hit the high-beams, whereupon all
interior (e.g. radio, dash, etc.) and exterior (e.g. headlights, front
running lights) extinguished.  I immediately returned to normal beam,
everything came back fine.  Got home, made a quick check in the rainy dark
with my wife in the back - noticed my left front headlight now dead, all
rear left lights dead... and the truly weird: my license plate light now
blinks when I try the left turn signal!  Everything on the right side
works fine.  What should I be looking for?  To my knowledge, no one fuse
serves the entire left side of my beloved Westy... assuming it was a short
from the headlight dimmer, where do I look?  How could it have affected my
lights the way it did?
3 - When I hooked-up the city water input to my garden hose this weekend to
clean my sink(Petunia's was dead for 4 yrs, kinda dirty back there), water
started shooting out my faucet, none to the tank.  Am I forgetting a valve
somewhere?

Many, many thanks for support.  It's indescribably nice to be an active
member of the list again, not just a lurker (what with a dead Westy and
all).  But now I can say &quot;Underway on VW Power&quot; (just no VW lights!)

Cheers
