Hello Tom,

I have tried out these coolers. They work pretty
well.They work great indoors. The only problem other
than a thermostat is that it will only cool to no more
than about 48 degrees below the outside temperature.
Depending on where you live, the summers in warmer
parts of the states can easily reach,say, 98 degrease.
Inside a parked car, it could easily reach + 110
degree. That means that the inside of the cooler would
be about 68 degrease at the coolest. I don't know if I
would trust any kind of dairy or meat products in
something like that. I guess it all depends on what
you intend to use it for. I bought a 12v cooler from
W_at_l Mart That looked a lot like the small cubical
style refrigerators. It even had a blower. It only
cost me $80 if I am not mistaken.(I am not referring
to those trendy, almost useless electric coolers that
only will hold a 12 pack)

That brings me to a question for the list, how
effective are the different models of refrigerators
that Volkswagen used in their Westies? Could they keep
things like dairy or meat products at safe
temperatures in the blazing heat of the summer? Would
they be more effective than the electric 12v coolers?


Excuse the excessive rambling,

&gt; So yeah, has anyone tried out one of these babies? 
&gt; They seem like the
&gt; cat's meow for the price...
