 Hi there everyone, I'm new to the list. Thought i
havw been reading it for a few weeks now. just got
back from a cross country trip in a 2000 toyota mr2
spyder. VW is missing out here. but thats another
story. I got home and decided to take my 79' westy out
to the local campground and relax. Well heres were my
problem occured, the van has been sitting a few weeks
and so i decided to turn it over via the start switch
installed in back, w/the coil unplugged I turned the
engine over a few times to pre lube it. no peculier
noises then. but when i started it up w/ the coil
hooked up it sounded horribble a very loud knocking
sound that didnt seem like it was going away so I shut
her down. What is it thats wrong. It made noise in the
past at start up but quite very quickly within a
minute
as oil pressure built up. I beleive the latter to be
normal. Any help or insight would be greatly
appreciated! Im afraid a rebuild will probably have to
be added to my to do list:( Thanks for reading and
thanks for any help.
