&gt; &gt; I assume since my 79' westy has a weber carb, that the
&gt;  &gt; feul pump was changed also in the prcess. so will I
&gt;  &gt; have to find a factory feul pump, when I switch back
&gt;  &gt; to F.I.?

Unless the PO left the FI pump in place and added a pressure regulator with a 
lower output. Then you'll just have to get an original p.r.

In any case, either part is easy to find used.
