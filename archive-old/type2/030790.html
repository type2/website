Hmm.  Bothersome, but not crappy.  I (200lbs) have personally bounced up
and down at the end of a 5 foot breaker to tighten that &quot;crappy&quot; nut and
have never even so much as dinged the nut.  I am personally of the
inclination that these things are relatively robust,  seeing as this
design has *somehow* held up in MILLIONS of engines over the space of the
past 60 or so years, so VW must've done something right.  The original nut
in my beetle seemed to last somewhere in the neighborhood of 300k-500k
miles with no apparent problems, maybe it was the exception rather than
the rule.

Let's all come to the realization that the beetle motor was the heart of a
very well designed package.  Not perfect, but good.  The only reason that
the type 4 engine was ever employed was to meet the insatiable power
demands of an American buying public.  Let us not forget that VW used the
1600 well into the '80s (vanagons) in Europe and continues to use it in
Brazil and Mexico (in beetles).

I personally believe that my '71 1600DP doghouse engine is a fine design.
It has its drawbacks, but it has somehow managed to help rack up 246,000
miles on my bus since it was installed in '71. (That's when the PO
replaced the SP after an overheat) 

YMMV, I've been quite happy with t1-1600 engines (except for the run-in
with a crappy machinist, but that's another story).  I'd recommend them to
anyone searching for a bus.
