  seat)

&lt;&lt;Yep, though you won't notice until the ring gaps meet.&gt;&gt;

Don,

The ring gaps will never meet--or shouldn't, unless you have an over
sized ring in a stock or under sized hole.

An over sized end gap on the rings will  give you and oil burner.

Think about it---how could a worn out cylinder and rings give you no end
gap?

If the cylinder's are going to be yanked to lap them into the heads--it
would be a wise idea to give them a quick cross hatch and a new set of
rings.
( then check for the proper end gap on the rings, and the piston to wall
clearance )

You mention in another post buying a new set of pistons and cylinder's.

Why not just bore to first over and fit first over rings and pistons to
the bored cylinder's?

Be a better deal---and a bigger bore---
