it is hard to find a good running 2 liter engine.  You might look in the
auto trader (http://www.traderpub_dot_com -- or maybe no www, I forget), and
check out the ads which claim to sell used running VW engines.  There are
two places in town I thnink.  It seems that the engines get pulled from
VWs very quickely after the get to junk yards, maybe someone at the yard
calls their friend, or maybe there is just a lot of demand.  I like the
junkyard in vista or so called Interstate VW.  It is a very nice husband
and wife place, mostly older VWs, and they are honest and friendly.  They
were going to sell me a working 2 L for $450, but then called it off when
they found it had poor compression in one cylindar.  That impressed me
since they could have tried to sell it anyhow.  Call them, and even if
they don't have an engine, go and have a look around their yard and see
what they've got, and then let them know what you want.  If you check in
for a few weeks I'm sure you will find somwthing and it will be usuable.
At a place like Ecology, they aren't helpful and will sell you junk if you
don't know better.  Also you would have to remove it yourself, whereas
interstate will remove it for you or at least help you.  Give them a call.
They are in the yellow pages under Auto: Salvage (look under 'A' for auto,
there are lots of entries.  Or I'll get you the number if you have trouble
finding it.
