&gt; That would make our typical 1.2 watt bulb rate at 12 to 48 lumens

You should treat the incandescent the same as the LED. I guessed at 1/9 of
the total lumens actually exiting the lamp at a 30 degree cone. That would
put the visible lumens at around 1.3 to 5.3. Much closer to the visible
output of the LED. This could be further improved on by removing the gels
and using the proper color LED.

&gt; Figuring Lumens for the listed LED at it's 30 degrees using the math from
&gt; this site.

Thank you very much for that link!

&gt; so total lumens for this LED would be 2.36
&gt; Reading further it says that actual lumens are typically higher than
&gt; predicted by this formula. But the numbers would still rate this LED *WAY*
&gt; below the incandescent it is intended to replace.

See above comment.

&gt; Light measurement is very subjective unless using VERY specialized
&gt; equipment though.
&gt;
&gt; I seriously doubt this one is going to be provable using &quot;the
&gt; numbers&quot; and
&gt; firmly believe it's a &quot;try it and see if you like it&quot; project. Lumens for
&gt; an incandescent are measured over the entire bulb surface
&gt; generally. Lumens
&gt; for these bulbs may be quite a bit lower considering only a
&gt; fraction of the
&gt; surface is pointed at the gels.

Couldn't agree more. I have a feeling that the total light output is
comparable. I'm ordering some tonight, and will report back to the list.
Give me a week or three.

&gt; It should also be noted that the light output of an LED can be altered by
&gt; grinding the LED casing to change the directionality.

These particular LED's are not a single LED, but rather a number of small
surface mounted LED's. They are very small and very flat, with a coating
over them. I don't know how much you could grind off them without damage.
Different spread angles are available off the shelf.

Thanks, Gerald.
