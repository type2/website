&gt; Not to get any more bunched panties out there, but when I was in
retail, it

in Orange

an 8.25
&gt; tax rate, I was responsible to collect the higher tax rate. If

&gt; lived out of state, you were responsible to pay the tax to your
state. 

Well, my involvement with retail is solely as a consumer, but the way
it works is thus:

If you are buying in the store, you pay whatever the store's local
sales tax is, regardless of where you live.
Bus folk do a lot of buying by mail, as most of us are not lucky
enough to have a parts source in our neighborhood.  Knowing how sales
taxes work can save us valuable bread, and also prevent surprises when
the Visa bill arrives!

If you buy by mail, and the store has a &quot;business presence&quot; in your
state, they collect whatever _your_ local sales tax might be.  this
must be a businessman's nightmare in Cal, where every county has a
slightly different sales tax.  I live in LA county, and if I have
something shipped to me from Modoc county (500+ road miles away) they
have to look up the LA county tax and charge me accordingly.

If you buy by mail, and the store doesn't have a &quot;business presence&quot;
in your state, they collect no tax and you are responsible to pay the
tax to your own state yourself. (We all do this, don't we?)

A lot of mail-order businesses make it a point to _not_ have a
business presence in the highly-populated states.  If you buy a
big-ticket item, often the interstate shipping is far less than the
sales tax you might have to pay.  Ever wonder why a lot of mail-order
outfits are in sparsely-populated northern tier states?  Now you know!

Every once in a while, states try to figure out a way to collect sales
tax from out-of-state mail order firms, but they have been stopped in
the courts by the fact that such taxation amounts to interstate
tariffs.  Since the mail-order industry keeps growing, I expect the
states to keep trying.

Ron, please don't open a branch store in California!  :)
