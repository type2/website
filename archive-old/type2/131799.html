Subject: RE: [T2] Re: oil pump removal

&gt;From: stevo

&gt;sometimes they back out with creative force, but recently i borrowed a
&gt;correct puller from an acvw mechanic and it was heavenly.  if you can get
&gt;the short block into a truck and bring it down you'd save yourself a return
&gt;trip too.   -steve


You could also try loosening the nuts that hold the case together in the 
general area of the pump.
