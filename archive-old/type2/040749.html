Jeff:

among other things, you wrote:
&quot;All I did was take off the dizzy and adjust the valves. Also think that
maybe my timing went way off, but don't know.&quot;

Three deep breaths.  Isn't that better ? :)

Now then.

I'd guess that you didn't seriously harm your engine if you only drove it
around the block.  Judging from what you've written here, it sounds like
your assessment that the timing might be way off might be correct.  Have
you tried retiming the engine?  Its real easy, though you'll need a timing
light and the timing specs for your engine.  If your engine is stock (a
very large if), the timing specs are in Bentley, Haynes and a number of
other places.

Good luck.
