Subject: Re: [T2] Friday topic: Where are they?

&gt; Where are they and what are they doing?
&gt;
&gt; Unca Joel?
I can answer that one, as I just went to visit him in December, and e-mail
fairly often. I suppose I shouldn't admit it here, but I was getting a
wasser-westy, into which I have since poured more money than most of my
aircooleds combined...those engines are expensive!!!!
Anyway, he is alive and well in Alabama, and I believe still posts on the
vanagon list quite a bit. I keep trying to get him to come up for
everybus, but have been unsuccessful so far. Maybe next year...
