Subject: Help! Can/should I temporarily disable Weber choke?
Message-ID: &lt;000501be96fb$ad7d99c0$e92f8ad1_at_18.41&gt;

Hi,

The '72 bus(1700cc/CB) equipped with Weber-32/36DFEV has been  running a bit
rich and idling high when warmed up. Sean Bartnik has helped me diagnose the
problem. It appears that a faulty electric heater element is keeping the
choke plate from opening. It will take some time to get a replacement
element. Can I temporarily defeat or disable the choke? I am sure that I
could block the plate open but will that defeat the rest of the choke
circuit?
