Subject: Fwd: bus weatherstripping

Todd; 

As you probably know, it is critical to get the &quot;right&quot; rubber for a bus.
If the door seals are aftermarket Brazilian, WCM, whatever, the great
likelyhood is that they will not fit properly. The brazilian door rubber I
tried to put on my 71 was a complete waste of 50 dollars. I had to slam
the door so hard that I ended up junking the seal and putting the factory
German one back on, even though it was leaking in places. 

I have heard many good things about Bus Depot rubber. No experience with
it as yet, but lots of good words on the list. I just received a bunch of
rubber from OEVeeDub, and it looks good so far, and apparently others have
had good results with their rubber as well. 

Best of luck
