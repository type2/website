&gt;A better place to pick up the switch power is from the alternator light
&gt;circuit.  That way the solenoid doesn't close until the alternator's
making power.

Great idea, Jim for a hands-free connection. I would submit the following caveats, 
however:

-If the Aux ever *does* go flat with that connection scheme, you lose the
option of giving the aux the boost of an external 110V charger before marrying
the pair--which I recommend (and have done).

-The alternator light in the air-cooled engine is its life's blood and I would
hesitate to risk anything but a perfect intervention.

Using and relying on an aux batt as I do, a small (6-amp) 110v charger is always
with my bus and me for a good top-off when electric is available. I respectfully submit the &quot;automation&quot; of the aux battery process may be trouble
lurking in the wings.

YMMV
