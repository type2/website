Subject: Exhaust questions

Hmm... I was browsing the archive and came across this message:
http://www.type2_dot_com/archive/type2/013650.html

While my math skills are REALLY rusty, I get the impression that I
would NOT be helping things by stripping my heat exchangers down to
the tubes. I've already removed the sheetmetal boxes from them, and
was considering cutting off the fins to reduce weight.

So is my impression correct? Would head temps actually go up if the
exhaust didn't have a way to release heat other than through the
tailpipe?
