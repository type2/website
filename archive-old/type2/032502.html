Subject: Has anyone ever...

Has anyone ever tried to put a fiberglass camper pop-top INSIDE of their
Vanagon??  I am picking up the parts to convert my sunroof into a camper and
it's about a 2.5 hour drive.  If this is possible I would like to do it in the
comfort of my Vanagon as opposed to being in the hell of driving my Dad's BIG
F-in OLD CH*VY work truck?  TIA





Peace, John Baker

headed on to the police officer's station...&quot;
