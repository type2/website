Subject: Ignition switch marathon

So I bought a complete, used ignition switch/cyl housing from a noted online
auction house since my switch required me to just about twist the key off to
get the bus to start.

The new housing arrived, looked good, though no VW part numbers on housing
made me nervous.  Key worked, fit was tight, you could hear the switch
activating.  Testing with my meter from terminal 30 to 50 for continuity in
the start position confirmed startability.

Prepare for R&amp;R.  Brad Clausen's writeup on Richard A.'s site up on the
'puter.  Tools assembled.  Smokes and Bentley at the ready for the hard
times.  Iced Tea.

Housing came out according to the writeup.  Bently uses some weird
terminology (shear bolt for what should be tamper-proof bolt - shear bolt is
up under dash as I understand).

The housing I pulled out turned out to be about 3&quot; longer where the steering
column goes through than the one I purchased, the mounting holes don't line
up right, etc, etc.  Seems I'd been E-hosed again.

I decided to just put the new switch from B-D in and see what happens.  No
go, my lock cylinder is too wobbly to get enough rotation on the switch to
get it around to the start position.

Decide to pull lock cylinders and work off of a hunch that the bug/bus
cylinders are basically the same.

Well this is where the rub lies.  The cylinders have a kind of spring (metal
band, not coil) around them that keeps them from being pulled from their
housing.  There is an access hole in the housing (may have to drill your own
for late 76 and on buses - see Bentley) where you depress a spring that you
have never seen and don't know the orientation of.  

Basically I shoved a nail in there in all sorts of angles and depths until
the cylinder (in &quot;ON&quot; position) allowed itself to be ripped from the housing
in a violent manner by channel-locks.

By 2am I had the two cylinders out.  A 113 P/N on one and a 211 on the
other, but visually identical.

Intalled 'bug' cylinder in my bus housing and installed new B-D switch,
terminal 30/50 tested good.

Reinstalled in bus and turned the key...

Instantaneous engine ignition like I have never seen from my bus, it roared
alive rather than the 3-4 turnovers before a weak start I had been used to.

Pros:  Bus is a reliable starter now

Cons:  Extra key, 7hours labor instead of a 45 minute swapout.
