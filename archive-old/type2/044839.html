Could you mic them to make sure? I just tried to put a steel insert into a 
1600 spk plug hole, with no luck. Ends up the pre-packaged kit had the tap 
1mm too large for the insert required/supplied...ruined head. Bummer!

Good luck,  Marv Krupp..who now uses a micrometer on the hose, before 
putting air in the tires...
