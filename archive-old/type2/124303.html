Subject: NAPA Shocks

has anyone tried the shocks from NAPA ($12.95 each) or the shocks from from JC
Whitney?...was wondering how they rated...

by the way, I put a 29 dollar Mex muffle on a 71 Beetle eng.  ...had to
pressure it a bit to get all the bolts lined up but finally got it...it does
ok but seems a little loud. I think I need to go back through it and
re-tighten all the nuts and bolts and see if that helps.
