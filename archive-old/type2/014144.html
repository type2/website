Subject: Re: [T2] Stuck valves and promises 

&gt; Thomas,
&gt; When the rotor is pointing at cylinder 2, it's actually cylinder 1
&gt; that's firing!  Then when it's pointing at 1, it's 2 that's firing; 3 is
&gt; 3 and 4 is 4.  The 1 and 2 cables are flipped!
&gt; 
&gt; There is a groove marked on the metal distributor housing (with cap
&gt; removed) that indicates when the rotor is in position to fire cylinder 1
&gt; (doesn't necessarily indicate TDC because the distributor may be
&gt; turned).  That mark should be pointing to the back right (passenger) or
&gt; 5 o'clock.
&gt; 
&gt; normal config:
&gt; 
&gt; 3    ______     1
&gt;     /       \
&gt;    | 3     2 |
&gt;    | 4     1 |
&gt;     \_______/
&gt; 4               2
&gt; 
&gt; or with a flipped drive dog:
&gt; 
&gt; 3    ______     1
&gt;     /       \
&gt;    | 1     4 |
&gt;    | 2     3 |
&gt;     \_______/
&gt; 4               2


whoa.  ok, now i'm seriously confused.

I'm just about to put my dist. drive shaft back in but decide
to do some sanity checking first:

bentley and muir say:  the slot in the dizzy drive shaft should be
perpendicular to the seam in the case.

looking at my vacuum advance dizzy and dizzy driveshaft, I note
that if i install the dizzy with the slot perp. to the seam in the
case, my rotor will fire like this:

 3    ______     1
     /       \
    | 2     1 |
    | 3     4 |
     \_______/
 4               2


this is how it had been firing and why, compared to the &quot;normal config&quot; 
listed above, coupled with the fact that my engine was running 1 cylinder
ahead/behind of itself, I thought my dizzy drive shaft had gotten flipped.

but now i note that it had been installed to spec:  what gives?

I had assumed:  perhaps very incorrectly, that the drive shaft had slipped
over a notch.  If not, did i just do my valves wrong and had the timing
seriously off, or...?

man, am i confused...
