Hello Listers,
    A while back someone posted a message that they received the same letter
from VW that is forwarded on this letter.  Have any of you ever heard
anything back from VW?  Since I received this letter, I have tried again to
get the birth certification on my Bus, to no avail.  What gives with VW on
this?
    Thanks,
    Brian Hayes
