Hi All-

I am selling a 1974 VW/Westfalila Add-A-Room (otherwise known as a tent)in
good complete condition for $500 USD. P-mail if you would like further info.

Technically it is correct for a 68-&gt; westy but you can use it quite easily on
any year van as the tent is self suporting and attaches to the drip rail via
rubber moulding.

There are a lot of good pics of these tents at Joe Clark's excellent web site
at www.supernet_dot_net/~jclark.

I am in Toronto, yes I will ship at the purchaser's expense etc etc.

Michael
