&gt;experience reinforces my point.  Say you had purchased (for the same price)
&gt;the cheap Chinese bearing with the lifetime warranty, and it failed the same
&gt;way.  Nothing would have been different. You'd still have had to redo the
&gt;job and replace the drum. The only difference is that if you paid shipping
&gt;both ways (which would have equaled the value of the part) they'd have sent
&gt;you another Chinese bearing in exchange. So you probably wouldn't have
&gt;bothered, lifetime warranty or not.

Not to make much of the original point as if it were Timken, Timken is a
fine bearing, the knocking of Chinese made bearings may be a bit harsh.

I've been using Autozone or Advanced cheapo Chinese crap on the fronts
for quite some time now, and have easily 50k on one set, running fine.  In
fact recently both said chains have gone to Polish or other ex-eastern block
manufacture parts which may be quality to rival US or German, who really
knows.  The main difference to me is getting the bearing that day for $5
instead of waiting 3-4 days to get if from Ron for $10 knowing I'm taking
the risk of a possibly inferior part.  I've had damn fine luck thus far.

The other problem Ron alludes to is that you never truly know what you
are getting.  A great case in point, at the rocket factory everything was
tracked and bought with an elaborate system of checks on the certification
of the &quot;quality&quot; of the parts.  We bought a lot of very expensive Parker
(biggest name in o-rings) o-rings made to a particular MIL-SPEC for some
motors only to find out later they were porous crap, as it ended up made
in a new Parker plant in Mexico that Parker knew it was having problems
with.  And our recourse for all those certs and BS, absolutely none at all
beyond the exchange of the o-rings, we would have done better to have
bought stuff off the shelf from Lowes.  Everyone should remember that
ISO 900x is after all not a quality spec, but merely a garantee of being
able to report the cause of low quality after the fact, and that is what so
much today is being manufactured to.

As to lifetime warrantees, well sometimes worth their weight in gold, other
times not worth crap considering the added frustrations of R&amp;Ring the part
again.  Certainly something invasive requiring a lot of labor, it makes sense
to use what you consider the best you can afford.  Do I use a Chinese wheel
bearing for the front, sure, for the back, hell no.  Did I use all fair
quality
OEM parts in my last engine rebuild, hell yes.  You got to figure out what
your time is worth and what the potential aggravation of being stranded 100
miles from nowhere on a cold snowy night means to you personally.  I
consider such challenges part of the leisure pastime of bus driving.

YMMV.
