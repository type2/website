Subject: Re: [T2] Front end vibration???

the other day while crusing at 60 or so in my 78 there was a sudden front
end vibration, more felt than heard, sort of like bad bearings, slowed
down and at 50MPH or so it went away,  have searched and searched I can
neither find a problem nor can I get it to repeat itself??

driving me nuts, any suggestions???

Bob
