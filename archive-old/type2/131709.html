Subject: RE: Fan Shroud and flaps &amp; covers

&gt;&gt;Michael, you said:   I have had a few emails about this so far you are the 
&gt;&gt;only one who has put a name to them. &quot;cofer&quot; Great I am trying to get some 
&gt;&gt;of them now,

&gt;Michael. 'cofer' is just a mis-spelling of 'cover'

Okay Got It. I thought it was just a misspelling of &quot;coffer&quot; as in 
cofferdam.

&gt;The fan shroud pushes air from the top for engine cooling, and from the 
&gt;bottom for air to go over/through the heat exchangers for heating. (through 
&gt;the heat exchangers and over the radiator styled fins on the tube(s) 
&gt;inside.)  When you say &quot;Seems like less would be forced onto the engine 
&gt;itself to cool it off?&quot; you may be misdirecting attention from the issue; 
&gt;the bottom section of the fan shroud.

What I am saying is that. If the air entering the heat exchangers is closed 
off, you close them by dashboard lever, then the air that was flowing 
through there is now added to the stream of air that is flowing over the 
engine. If the covers/coffers(=D) are not there, when you close off the HEs 
then the air that would be added is lost by way of open air where covers 
should be. Or is there sometype of release at the front of the HEs when they 
are closed off?

&gt;You need the flaps and the covers during the summer time to get air to your 
&gt;front windshield to defrost in the morning.  Also, in Virginia, it is an 
&gt;item in the safety inspection.

Defrost or Defog? I have never had to defrost in the summer, even when I 
lived in Richmond, VA driving my '69 Squareback.

&gt;There is/are rubber seals for the covers.  I have seen them and they may be 
&gt;available.

&gt;You can put the flaps and covers on later.  But remember, the covers are 
&gt;another point of support for the heavy heat exchangers and muffler.  
&gt;Without these covers, the weight of the exhaust headers / 'U' tubes / heat 
&gt;exchangers / muffler / EGR filter is supported by the 4 x 2 exhaust studs 
&gt;at the engine heads / exhaust headers. It is not so much the weight of the 
&gt;heat exchangers that the covers assist in, but the total vibration of the 
&gt;setup.

That is something I did not think of. I will keep this in mind as I rig(PO 
Conception) for temporary and plan for future.

Thanks Barry,
