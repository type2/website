Subject: resurface flywheel

I was looking at Rimco's price list and for a 411/914 style flywheel they
say they charge $30 for doing 3 surfaces. What is the 3rd surface? I thought
there were only two involved in a step-cut.

http://www.rimcovw_dot_com/prod01.htm

The going rate around here to do a bus flywheel seems to be about $40.
Anyone that has to outsource it to a machine ship seems to charge a $20
premium on top.

I called a few VW shops and a couple actually just send customers to NAPA
for this type of machine work. I think I'm going to send it to Kohlweiss in
Redwood City.
