&gt; I've searched TS for a while now.  I'm still looking for the Westy spare

&gt; years have the same camping interior.  75-79 perhaps?  Anyone have one 

I haven an extra one... the one with the door and cubby holes in it. 
It's been sitting in my living room and I don't know what to do with it :)

Where are you located?
