&lt;&lt;  I believe that Wurth Products or some
other supplier may have these available.
Lacking that has anyone any experience with speedo repair shops? Palo Alto
speedometer is the only name I've heard. Has anyone used them? &gt;&gt;

Bucks...If you find a supplier for the plastic gears let us know...Palo Alto
must get them from somewhere...Other speedos use the same set up -
Smiths, Jaeger - with the same deterioration. The speedo's not that hard
to rebuild with parts.
