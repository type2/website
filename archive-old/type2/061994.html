&gt; It looks as though I will pulling the generator this afternoon [yeah],
&gt; as something must be wrong deep inside...though any visual evidence of
&gt; a burnt armature is not there.  It is a little disconcerting that it
&gt; was working fine last year, but decided not to come out of winter
&gt; hibernation. 
&gt; 

I managed to rig a poor-man's CAT probe this afternoon and measure the
current in the generator/regulator assembly...my little gizmo was
calibrated in the range of 0 to 60 amps DC and output a voltage
between 0 and 1 volt which I was able to read with my el-ancient
Simpson.

This turned out to be a good thing, for it prevented I from pulling
the generator [I new it looked fine].  The direction that all the
little electrons were heading told I that the regulator wasn't doing
its thing quite the way I remembered it should.

So I borrowed the regulator from the Thing [it is in need of new pans
and is currently being stripped for a trip to the sandblaster].
Exchanged regulators and presto...current flowing in the correct
direction.  The only thing left to check is that the regulator cuts
out properly...the battery, etc was soo low that it charged during my
entire hour run up river.  I have the shore-line on it this evening,
so I can test the new regulator more in the morning.

...I guess that sometimes we should trust our instincts ;)

Bugs &amp; Things &amp; Splits...Oh, my!
