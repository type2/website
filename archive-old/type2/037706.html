&gt;I had exactly the same problem on my '70 with a VDO tach. There is a very

&gt;at Radio Shack for .70, in the line that runs from the coil. I am sorry I
&gt;don't have the exact part number for this, but you can find it in the
&gt;library or archives. Works like a charm.

The one I used was a 150 ohm 1/2 watt resistor, Radio Shack part # 271-013.

It worked for me!
