Subject: campouts near DC

Does anyone know of any local campouts near DC coming up. I would like to get a list of any upcoming campouts through the end of the year so I can plan accordingly. Anything within about 200 miles would be good. Is there one place I can go to get all this information ie. a website?

Sharon
