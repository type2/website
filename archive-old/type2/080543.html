Subject: Re: [T2] '72-'74 exhaust in '77 update

Fix it soon - I pulled several studs out b/c I overtorqued the nuts. It 
doesn't take much.

If nothing else get some HVAC ductwork hanging straps from the local 
hardware store and tie it up to the frame.

I had to fix my pulled studs with Chevy exhaust studs (worked well) but I 
would suggest it very loudly - very scary thinking I might drill too far or 
be off center or???

Congrats on the new exhaust.

&gt;Back before the holiday's I inquired about installing '72-'74 era 
&gt;heaterboxes &amp; muffler on my '77. Overwhelmingly y'all confirmed that it 
&gt;would bolt up.  Much thanks to Nikki Elko for the quality used heater 
&gt;boxes and BusDepot for straightening out the stainless steel muffler 
&gt;problem- in the end it worked out fine. Parts in hand, I drove upstate NY 
&gt;over the holidays to use my father's lift and heated garage.  I must have 
&gt;read similar advice here before because I was careful to file every mating 
&gt;surface shiny and clean. After some jiggling and 1 horrible exhaust leak 
&gt;on #3 where the gasket didn't line upright (you wouldn't believe how it 
&gt;tore up a brand new copper gasket), it is beautifully quite compared to my 
&gt;old strait pipes and glass packs, leak free, and hopefully ready for Mr. 
&gt;Inspection.
&gt;
&gt;I currently don't have any hanger on the boxes so just the exhaust studs 
&gt;are supporting the whole thing (that SS muffler ain't light!) so I'm 
&gt;looking for someone to weld something for me from the old hanger.
&gt;
&gt;Next step is get it inspected and registered in NJ...
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Thanks for all the comments and feedabck, and happy bussing
