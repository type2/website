Subject: RE: [T2] Fuel Injector

&gt;From: Chuck Shultz The seller didn't indicate what year bus the parts were 
&gt;from.  The part numbers on all 4 are VW 022 906 031B / Bosch 0 280 150 100.

&gt;From what little info I've been able to find in my Googling, they appear to 
&gt;have the same flow rate as the VW 022 906 031D / Bosch 0 280 150 114's that 
&gt;were on my bus (and which appear to be the proper part)

&gt;Are these a direct interchange part?  What's the difference (aside from 
&gt;color of plastic and a slightly different hose barb)?  What was the 
&gt;original application?

Here you go Chuck. The VW number doesn't match or atleast the D. But the 
Bosch number matches FI for 76-79 Bus. Check out Richard's table for 
interchange:

Hope this helps,
