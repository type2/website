Subject: Westy Trim

OK, my quest goes on.
I am looking for two items, as follows:
AA)
Inside rubber trim pieces for the INSIDE of Casper. These trim pieces 
go around the louvered windows, and serve more as a decorative addition 
than anything else.
BB)
Inside plastic trim piece that goes around the INSIDE of the pop-top 
cut-out in the bus roof.
This piece would have, most probably, been white in original 
configuration,
The trim piece would have been nothing more than a U shaped trim piece 
that serves to dress the union of the headliner pieces to the roof 
cut-out hole.

For this, I am suspecting that a standard U shaped pop top trim piece 
might work, but do not know.
Anyone tried this?
If this readily available U piece trim will fit, and if it can be 
bought long enough, that will solve item (BB).
Of course, the trim piece will be black, but that is OK.
