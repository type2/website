Subject: Another bus+ in the corral

Id been talking to some folks for the past couple months about 3 VWs they 
have sitting in their back yard. Well sunday I got a call from them and they 
said I could have them for X amount of dollars, so I went right over. The 
first to come out(and easiest) was a 1979 Deluxe Westfalia that had sat 
since 1989. It was parked because of it needing  some FI work, but they 
didnt want to fool with it right then. It ran, but just not quite up to par. 
Over 10 years of sitting close to trees made for a nasty looking van. On a 
scale of 1 to 10, the inside is between an 8 and 9. The outside washed up 
good and the orginal paint is still in good shape. Some colorback and it 
might just shine like new. The worst thing about the camper is the canvase. 
When it was parked, it was almost perfect. It seems that roaches love the 
taste of canvas and have been having a good meal the past 10 years. Now all 
I have to do is see if it will run. I just wonder what kind of problems I 
will run into with the FI system.

Next to come home will be a 1966 bug that has been sitting in a barn since 
1983. I guess an old German mechanic talked this guy into letting him 
rebuild the engine while it was in the shop for something else. It seems 
that when the engine was done and he drove it home, the oil light had came 
on. The old German fella said he had built hundreds of engines and there was 
no way anything could be wrong. He said to drive the car and if the engine 
blew up, he would replace it for free.  Well, he said he just couldnt bring 
himself to do that, so he just parked it. SO, this engine has only 15 miles 
on a 17+ year old rebuild.

The 3rd one is a crusty hardtop 64 to 66 camper. That one is gonna more than 
likley become a parts van if anything is left good on it. I will just have 
to look at it better once its home and cleaned up.

Just another day in VW paradise !

David
