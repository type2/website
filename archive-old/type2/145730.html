Subject: Re: [T2] funny connector

Hi Heloise.  Actually I got that picture of a bus for sale on  Ebay.  I don't have a drink holder on the dash.  Just one of  those organizers between the seats.  But I need them as I'm going  to replace it with a stool.  In which I'm going to mount a  subwoofer and amp as per Mike Benithin.  Thanks for the  idea.  Looks easy and cheap.  My two most important criteria  for most things, ha.  Cheers...KR

I have the same, and I have positioned my identical drink holders on either 
side of the dash.

What I did was pull out the left / right swivel vents, clean them up with 
all the deteriorating foam insulation, and put the tail of the drink holder 
in the opening, then just slide the vent back in.

I holds in really tight and  I can hang a 44 oz soft drink in there .  
Actually, on the drink holder on the passenger side, I wrapped some tape 
around the two fingers of the drink holder, or the 44 oz drink will not 
stay.

But a picture is worth 857 words, so here it is, and I will shut up:
