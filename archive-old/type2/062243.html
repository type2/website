All,

I got a fax from Robert Bosch Nederland, it contains
info like contact pressure, point gap, begin and end
of advance curve, amount advance, dwell etc
for the VJ(R) 4 BR 1 through 35, so if you need anything,
let me know. Unfortunately, this list does not cross-
reference to VWs or VW part#s

Brian.
