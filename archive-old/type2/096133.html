Subject: RE: [T2] Re: sudden exhaust noise.


WELL the list just saved me a lot of headache....not something I didn't
know about (the list too) but when you are expecting one thing and
something totally different wacks out it takes someone here to mention the
obvious that you overlook.

I have been nursing an older head until I take the engine out for
something else then will stick on the rebuilt one...well when exhaust
system sounds like it blew up you at first think, &quot;there goes the
head&quot; and gird your loins (what ever that means) and prepare yourself for
an engine pull,  well someone here mentions &quot;did you check to see if you
spit a spark plug&quot; 
  noooooooo I'm too busy getting ready to pull the engine.....check sure
enough plug is just lying in the hole....screw it back in, engine runs
fine...list saved me a lot of kicking myself when I found out I had pulled
an engine to change a spark plug......duh.....

THANKS 
I owe the list a big one
