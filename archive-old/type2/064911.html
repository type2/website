Subject: Turbo...bearing replacement &amp; EFI info...

I am rebuilding a Turbocharger for use on my 64 Double EFI/Turbo project.  I
was suprised to see what appear to be Bronze bushings (oil pressurised).
Does anybody know if this is the stock 'bearing'.  Maybe I can upgrade to
some better material.....I can definatlely duplicate these.

Also looking for Fuel Injection Info.....need a 'direct' way to fire my fuel
injectors without scrounging Arizona for the rest of the system that I have.
