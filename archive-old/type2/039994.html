Subject: No Muffler --&gt; burn valves?

I just installed a extractor type exhaust system, and within a couple of 
days the muffler broke off right where the flange bolts onto the extractor. 
It had only a couple of spot welds. Believe it or not I never heard it break 
off, I was happily crusing down the highway. Probably bounced around for a 
while while the bracket bolt broke off as well. I guess all that loud music 
did do some damage. The flange only had three spot welds holding it on. 
Should have gone OEM, but the crossover pipe is long gone.

Anyway my question will it burn my valves driving around without a muffler? 
Might be a week until UPS delivers a new &quot;GT&quot; style system. Maybe I'll have 
better luck. Anybody have any luck with the GT style exhaust from Rocky 
Mountain?

I'll be curious to see if Rocky Mountain gives me a refund on the muffler 
when all I have left is the flange that's bolted to the extractor. So far 
their return policies have been very good.
