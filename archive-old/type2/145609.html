&gt; &gt;I routinely leave my tube of hylomar in my bus through SoCal summers.  I
&gt; &gt;never noted any change in the stuff.  In fact, I've never heard of any

&gt; &gt;print.

&gt; They've stated that it's good for 6 months on the shelf when stored at 5-25C.

Dang, if they are that concerned with temps like that, it's a wonder the
stuff works at all at 200F+ on my valve covers!  :)

I'm not too worried,  2-year old hylomar stored in my bus seems to seal
just fine.
