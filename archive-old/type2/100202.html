Subject: body/paint work Price

Hello list,

I will get back my 78 Westfalia body on Friday. I have yet to see it 
painted, but can't wait.

I was wondering what other people have paid for body and paint work? My bill 
is just under $5k and a little below the estimate and far below other 
estimates. How does this compare?

I liked the guy who did the work and was pleased with the results I saw 
prior to painting. My bus (Vegas Bus) had no rust but some dents mainly in 
the nose (not replaced, but pulled and fixed) and a half dozen other minor 
dents. He also replaced the worn out lower sliding door track by cutting out 
the strip from above and replacing it with a heavier gauge of strip metal, 
which looks stronger than new. He painted the engine compartment plus a few 
select spots inside. I dropped off the bus in June as a body. No glass, no 
rubber, no gas tank, engine/trans, no pop-top, and no interior including 
dash. Just a body.

Anyway I'm just wondering what others have paid even though It won't change 
anything for me. Except maybe make me feel like I got a good or fair deal. I 
just hope I have not asked a question committing me to a lifetime doom, 
misery, and regret and that I have actually paid too much.

As always thanks,

Brandt
Utah
