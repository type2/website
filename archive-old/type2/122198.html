Subject: Engine Oil on Concrete Garage Floor

OK, I have to clean up TWO oil spills.

After I get the oil wiped up by paper towel, what COMMERCIAL PRODUCT do you 
recommend to clean up the final film of oil on the concrete.

Note: it is too cold outside to open the garage door and too cold outside to 
use the garden hose to spray out any residue.

I have tried scrubbing one of the oil spills on my hands and knees with hot 
water and Tide , but there is still enough oil on this first spot to be too 
slippery to walk on.
