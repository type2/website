Did you use an ohmmeter to see if the ground connections to to
&gt;injectors are actually being grounded when the engine cranks?

Will looking at the ECU transistor drivers with an ohm meter tell you any 
anything?  I don't understand this measurement. Ohm meter measurements are 
not normally made on active circuits.
