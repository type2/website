&gt; So, 1st question:  The carb is labeled &quot;30/31 PICT&quot; the on the side.  It 
&gt; looks in every other respect like a 30 PICT-3, but I can't find any listing 
&gt; for it in the Bentley 1968-1979 Type 2 Service Manual or in the Idiot's 
&gt; Guide.  So what is it?  Do I treat it just like a 30 PICT-3?

This is the mex/brazil replacement carb for 30 pict's as well as 31 pict
carbs.  Treat it like a 34 pict 3, as it operates almost 100% identical.

&gt; 2nd question:  The specific problem I'm trying to solve is a major 
&gt; hesitation when attempting to move from idle to acceleration.  This engine 
&gt; has also developed an unwillingness to idle until it is warmed up (then it 
&gt; idle's fine).  According to Bentley, this is probably a problem with a 
&gt; blockage in the area of the accelerator pump/pilot jet, but I'm wondering 
&gt; if anyone has any other things to check.  This engine is equipped with a 
&gt; .009 distributor with Pertronics electonic ignition, timed to 10' BTDC.

Well, much like the 34 pict carbs, the H30/31 is picky about its settings,
with regard to the 009.  First off, you need to see what your .total.
advance is set to with your timing, not just your idle/static timing.
each 009 is different...you want about 28-32 degrees of advance around
3000 rpm. maybe its 3500..whichever, when it stops advancing, that is the
total advance.

Other then that, you can try slightly increasing the fuel volume for the
accel. pump.  There is adjustment in the linkage on the pass. side of ht
ecarb.  You may have a double-nut setup with a threaded rod, a plastic
locking sorta nut on the rod, or the old cotter pin and holes setup...I've
seen each of these on various H30/31's.

Or go for the rejetting route..


What .I. end up doing, usually, is to cheat.  I will use the fast-idle
stop screw (at the top of the accl linkage on the drivers side of the
engine) to kepe the throttle butterfly just a hair open, sometimes more,
enen with the choke open...speaking of which...Have you checked the
adjustment of your choke?

I will them retune the carb as per the books, and check for lag.  If it
still exisits, i'll opent he throttle a bit more, and retune.  its a
cheat, but then, a 009 doesnt belong on a stock VW engine, either.

but, the could starting problem sounds like you may be having some choke
trouble.  Check that out first.


good luck.
