Subject: Transition from Gas to Diesel

I will be the first to admit that I have very little knowledge of the difference between a gas engine and a diesel. With that, can a standard FI bus engine be converted to diesel?

Also, is there a diesel engine that will fit in place of the bus engine and actually make the car go?

With gas prices going up, and the techno advances in biodiesel and such, I just thought it would be a worthwhile idea to entertain.

Too bad the only SUV I have found that runs diesel is the Volkswagen Touareg. It's a nice vehicle, but Consumer Reports slammed it on safety and reliability.
