When did the 1600's stop in the Beetles?  Or did they...

My 71 Campmobile has no exhaust at present, but looking around in a local
junkyard, I found a &lt;73&gt;Beetle with intact exhaust and perfect, rust free
exchangers. I know the exhaust is different, the question is, are the
exchangers? Can I use 'em on my bus? TIA

Tom
