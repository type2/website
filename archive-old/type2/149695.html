Subject: RE: [T2] Re: oil breather hose-&quot;cream fouling&quot;

Need a thermostat folks?  Our favorite website:   Item number: 8033339937

Get it while it's hot!  :^D

Re the &quot;cream&quot; under your fill cap or in breather box- I will second the 
need for a thermostat closing the flaps in winter  driving with short trips. 
  After about 155K I finally fixed my non-working one- much better warmup in 
winter and less foam-you gotta do some 3500 rpm driving for at least 1/2 hr 
to drive off the water vapor.  If you have no thermostat, and do short 
trips,  wire the flaps shut.  If you have a pressure gauge, you can see when 
the oil cooler is opening up- when the pressure drops suddenly (by at least 
20, like 60 to 40), the oil temp has reached 180, based on my observations.
