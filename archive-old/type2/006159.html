Joe,

I bought a 12&quot; long rubber hose when I bought my sending unit.  It has the
right fittings on each end and is made by VDO.  I bought mine from Bus Boys
for $22.50, but I hear you can probalby get one cheaper at  a hose store.
The hose was just long enough to allow the sender to mount on the bulkhead.

Good Luck,

&gt;Egads! the $35 sending unit I just bought to hook up my light and my oil
pressure gauge doesn't fit on the '77 engine I have. Well, the threads will
fit, but the unit itself is too big without extending it out quite a bit
with a small piece of pipe, which I recall is not a good idea.
