Subject: Hi, I'm back

hi y'all

I'm back from my British expedition, including a side trip to Holland for
 theVW Euro meet.   As I'm still on that time, it means that this is really
9am and i haven't slept, except cat naps on the plane.   And my kitty is
happy to see me again.  :)  I actually drove a VW  for the first time in a
month, except driving the Brasilia bus around Winnie's yard, and it was fun
to drive Bugster back through the rain (yes, this is western Washiington)
from the airport.  ( Joe and jan who came to pick me up didn't want to drive
back.)

So I guess this means I'll actually have to put a FUNctioning wiper motor in
the 65 camper before I can drive it.  Hm.  Summer's over, folks,  are your
heaters working?

Clara
