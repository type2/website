Well I can honest say &amp; with a good degree of accuracy when the &quot;demented
pot smoking PO&quot;, repaired both front wheel arches, 1 rear corner lower front
panel, sliding door &amp; both rear arches. About September 12th '95. Know how I
know?

Well I just spent 3 seconds removing ALL of the above panels with my bare
hands! All the fronts were sound except for a bit of perforations. In
amongst the egg boxes, cardboard packing he used, were about 20 pages of
news paper all with the above date on! How considerate!

Well I've got all the panels etc. &amp; I can HIGHLY recommend Alan Scofield for
your panels. Quick dispatch &amp; good prices &amp; if the part you need is not made
as a repair, he can fabricate it for you!!!

Oh well, greetings from the UK, bin busy for weeks so I'd better get the bus
ready soon, baby's due on the 22nd of June!!

I'M NOT READY TO BE A DAD!
