&gt;Depends on how closely the pushrods match. He said he did his best. They are the saem and not 1/8&quot; different - right? I mean wouldn't valves with different lifts cause a bad idle?

No, because the lifts are not diffent.  The only difference is that the rocker arm would be moving through a slightly different arc.  As long as it is within the limits of ajustability, it will not cause any major problems, at least not right away.  If one was way too short or too long, it would show up when he tried to ajust the valve lash.
