I've used similar stuff, but it usually comes with serious warnings, like
chromosome and gene damage or something like that. I got a little on my
skin, so I probably forgot what the label really says. ;) Joe

&gt; &gt;What's the deal with this stuff?  Does it work?  Am I doing something
&gt; &gt;wrong?  Is it intended for use on only the lightest of surface rust?
&gt; &gt;Is there anything that works better?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Any advice for rust removal welcome!

&gt; We have used Permatext Extends on many vehicles, including the Westy
&gt; with great results. Grind off the surface rust then spray on the 
&gt; Extends. It causes a chemical reaction that changes the rust. You end
&gt; up with a black hard surface on the bare metal. Doesn't seem to 
&gt; affect the paint either.
