Subject: Re: 78 Champagne Edition worth?

I wanted to chime in on this one; I am the second generation
owner of, coincidentally, a '78 Westphalia, champagne edition.

My father bought it when I was 4 and my brother was 2, the van
was something like 6 mos. used.  I still remember going to the
dealership &amp; looking at it; took several days to decide.

Since my father was in the army, our family spent many years
camping in Europe, as well as the US.  I learned to change
oil, plugs, points, etc. on this van...  

So I'd say, do your best to keep it!  I would never part
with mine; I'll bet most kids who grew up in one feel the
same way!  Just take 'em camping whenever you get the
chance.  Also, my mother never did learn to drive it...  :)
