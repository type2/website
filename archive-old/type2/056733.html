2.How much oil should you put in the air cleaner that hooks up to the

Dear Greg &amp; fellow listies,

Though this may seem a minor question,  I was just wondering the very
same
  thing.  I think that information of this nature is exactly what this
list is
  all about and would like to encourage either the admin. or Greg please
attach
 at least one correct response to this as thread.  Too often I have
searched  the
 archives and found questions on subjects I needed the answer to and
there was no
 answer to the question, thus defeating the purpose of archiving the
posting.

P.S.   A good subject heading helps speed the search also.

 Thankx Volks!

 May the &quot;Busma&quot; preserve us all !
