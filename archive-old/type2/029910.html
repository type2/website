&gt; Greetings List -
&gt; 
&gt; Just today on my way to work, I noticed a squeak whenever I turned the
&gt; steering wheel. I couldn't get under the bus to check it out (work garb and
&gt; all). Any tips on steering box lube?

Specified lube is gear oil, same as the tranny.  Fill to the top.  It's
apain to get in.

You rsqueak might also be in the turn signal mechinism.
