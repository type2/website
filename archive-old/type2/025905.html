&gt; Listees -

&gt; Normally I wouldn't post this to the list, but my
&gt; surfing efforts have yielded nought up to this point.
&gt; I would like to find a website that describes the
&gt; process of heat shrinking warped metal in detail. My
&gt; 71s rear quarter needs this, and I'd like to have some
&gt; idea how it's done before I go at it. I do have basic
&gt; torch welding skills, but this seems like another
&gt; order of beast.

You're better off with an autobody repair manual. Most FLAPS have them in
the book aisle. You also need a rosebud tip.
