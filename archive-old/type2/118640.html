Subject: [T2] Help! Break in questions


&gt; Just got my new longblock running, and there is a lot
&gt; of smoke coming out of the tail pipe.  I had enough
&gt; time to adjust the timing and it seems to be running
&gt; fine . . . except for the smoke coming out of the
&gt; tailpipe.  Is this normal? if so, how long should this
&gt; continue? if not, what may be causing this?  I checked
&gt; the compression on one of the cylinders, it was 150,
&gt; so it doesn't make any sense because doesn't seem like
&gt; oil would get past the rings at this compression level
&gt; enough to make it smoke.  any advice greatly appreciated!

Did you do your 2,000 rpm break-in &quot;first run&quot; for 20 minutes, and then have
smoke after that?  I'd say there's only 2 logical sources then, either it's
running way too rich (black smoke, strong gas smell) or it's burning oil
somehow (blue smoke, oily smell.)   Absent that, I'd say a new engine
shouldn't smoke.
