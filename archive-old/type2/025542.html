&gt; I bought a 3/4&quot; slide bar at a pawn shop in GA that I went to with Charlie
&gt; F (6.00) I stopped carrying the cheater pipe because you can get so much
&gt; leverage by standing on the end of the breaker no axle nut or lug bolt has
&gt; been able to resist. stand on the end of the breaker and hold the drip
&gt; rail, bounce a bit if need be thats some serious torque.

Any suggestions for securing the wheel against turning?

My 72 Riviera has a pair of rather firmly attached axle nuts. I put my 3/4&quot;
drive ratchet on a nut, put a little chock block under the wheel, stood on
the end of the ratchet. The ratchet's two feet long, so my 150 lbs means 300
lb-ft. No movement in anything. I jumped up and down on the ratchet, and the
wheel turned.
