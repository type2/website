Subject: Re: [T2] diesel conversion (some questions)

&gt;what is HP of the 2.0 Type IV compared to the 1.6
&gt;Diesel? if anyone knows HP of both GREAT but all i'm
&gt;really looking for (from this list) is the HP figure
&gt;for the 2.0 Type IV.(searched archives for this to no
&gt;avail)
&gt;
&gt;also, does anyone know of anyone who has done this
&gt;conversion or something similiar? perhaps a website or
&gt;email address would be helpful.
&gt;
&gt;thanks very much. as always any answers, opinions or
&gt;insights will be GREATLY appreciated!!!! thanks
&gt;again!!!

FWIW somewhere I got an VW T&amp;A article from like '85 or so of a guy
who put a Quantum turbo diesel in a '74 or so using the vanagon
bellhousing.  He mounted two inclined radiators in the back at angles
ducting the air down the scoops to them.  Had a factory ZF in it, had
lifted it and had toured all over South America and Africa in it.  Pretty
awsome, got like 38mpg, and he had these pics of it slugging through
3 feet of mud somewhere in South America.  So it is very possible, is
it practical?  Another story.  Should not be that hard to do though as all
the parts are now pretty much bolt in available if you find a parter diesel
Vanagon.  I really liked his radiator solution though that was what was
coool about it, used two big like 1000cc motorcylcle radiators and kept
all the plumbing in the back so you couldn't tell it was water cooled,
plumbed a heater core though up to the front.  As to power, well you will
be sad, but look this way, you'll be a pile better than a stock '83 diesel
Westy 8-)  2.0 is nominally 70hp or so, the 1.5 is like 47 and the 1600
is like 53 as my memory serves (poor memory) but the 1600 probably
has nearly the same torque.  A Jetta or Quantum turbo diesel would be
the real ticket though, or if you go with the normal aspiration, maybe find
a '74 tranny to get a bit more appealing revs though top end would be
limited by diesel rev wall.
