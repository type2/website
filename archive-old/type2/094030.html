Subject: Re: [T2] Top Ten Things I LOVE about drivng my VW

my number 1.  Pulling over for a fresh pot of coffee anywhere.  (helps 
if the vehicle is a westy with a stove)
my number 2.  Perfect lunch break spot to lay back listen to tunes and 
enjoy number 1

jimt

&gt;
&gt; offer some of the reasons I love driving my bus...It
&gt; is Friday after all...
&gt;
&gt; 10.Owning a vehicle with a personality
&gt; 9. Jealous stares from people trapped in their SUV's
&gt; at stoplights
&gt; 8. The purr of a finely tuned air-cooled engine
&gt; 7. AIRS
&gt; 6. Waves from other VW owner's on the road
&gt; 5. Not having to pay for a motel room
&gt; 4. Ability to do my own repairs - even if it is on the
&gt; side of the road in the rain
&gt; 3. Sitting high over the road
&gt; 2. Going slow - It is ok to slow don now and then
&gt; 1. The almighty type2 list
&gt;
&gt; Now get out there and drive your bus!  Happy Friday...
