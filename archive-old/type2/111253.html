&gt; Hey guys,
&gt;
&gt; 	Anyone live here in Florida have an &quot;Antique&quot; license plate on their
&gt; car? I'm not sure exactly what the benefit is (if any) but my 1973 VW Bus

From what I gather the only benefit is the &quot;classic&quot; looking solid blue
plate with white letters.

Same cost, as far as I can tell, no other restrictions.  Surprisingly the
Florida HSMV seems a bit vague on these.

The only restriction appears to be that your vehicle must be 30 years old
or older from the date of manufacture.
