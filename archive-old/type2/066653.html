Subject: '71 electical diagnostic terminal

My '71 Westfalia has an plastic socket mounted to the roof of the engine
compartment, above the battery. According to my wiring diagrams, it's
the terminal for diagnostic circuitry. VW mechanics, apparently, had
machines that they could hook up to the terminal to find out the health
of the starter, generator, coil, etc.

Does anyone know anything about using this terminal? I know that mine is
hooked up to at least some of the electrical system's equipment, but I
have no idea how to interpret the current in the various connections in
the terminal. Any ideas on where I could find specs? Has anyone ever
seen one of the diagnostic analyzers for sale?
