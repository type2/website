Subject: Re: [T2] Re: [VB] OT: Verizon Phone Service for Bus Traveling

&gt;well, I guess this is one of those &quot;perfect&quot; questions for me to answer.  
&gt;My
&gt;Karma, er...busma would be screwed if I didn't.
&gt;
&gt;I sell Verizon.  I use Verizon.

Ack, what the hell was that?

Phones and VW?


BTW Mr. Verizon, my cell service is $10.95/month for 500 anytime minutes all 
over the country with free long distance and call waiting.

BUS CONTENT: Most of the places I have taken my bus where I could use a cell 
phone the most are places where there is NO cell tower, no cell service. 
Anywhere else there were pay phones.

Short Story of bad bussdom follows delete NOW:

I was headed down a lonely old forest road in northern washington state in 
my 70 on labor day many years ago. I was going way too fast, at night. I saw 
a Huge hole in front of the bus left by a tree that had been blown over, 
pulling its root ball with it. The hole was about 6 feet wide, 6 feet deep 
and right in the middle of the road. I slammed on the brakes, only to slide. 
I tried turning the bus and ended up resting on the side of the hole with 
the rear wheel on the passenger side falling in, but not all the way. The 
bus sat at a precarious angle, with the back end threatening to fall in all 
the way. What was I to do? I slept in the bus anyways, it was late, waking 
up every so often when I was crammed up againt the side.
The point is I had to hike out to a mian road and flag down a driver who 
then went bak to town and found the only open tow truck place to get me out. 
The moral? With todays modern technology it would not have made a damn 
difference. Slow down on old grassy log roads (duh) and be prepared.
Jason
