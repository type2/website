Oh Boy---

0 clearance stated--zero clearance understood.
If you wanted me to think .0005 why didn't you write that?

Finger slip on the keyboard?---:&gt;)

That mut have been the point--you missed the right key.

Please tell me what automoblie is VW manufacturing in 2002 that is air
cooled?

Hmm---maybe I'll have to down the street, and check out the lot at
VW--perhaps I missed a new model.

And---according to more than one VW wrench----(Krauts, rockheaded, 35
years with VW) &quot; dis multi grade stuff is sheist, run straight weight
oil, dey last longer&quot;

What do they know--they only work there.

However as a footnote to their comments, they did mention that if in
fact a guy couldn't locate straight weight oils of good quality--use
20/50 Castrol GTX--this is the next best thing.

They wouldn't even discuss syn oils.

I dump my syn oil in my air cooled Bus every 2.5k--overkill
In my Vanagon's--every 3k---Castrol 50w summer--30w winter( with a quart
of Marvel all the time )

OK--your turn.

Here we go again. 
&lt;&lt;The VW's oiling system is based on pressure, NOT TEMPERATURE. if you
run a too-heavy oil in there, pressure will be fantastic, but the engine
will &quot;think&quot; the oil is too cold and will bypass the oil cooler. Guess
what happens to your oil temps?&gt;&gt; 
Really? 
So when your blasting down the asphalt ribbon at 65 mph, on a 100 degree
day into a headwind laboring the engine, there isn't any thermal
breakdown of the viscosity ? 
do you change your oil every 15k miles? 
&lt;&lt;After all, if you run 0 clearance on your bearings, the oil pressure
will be incredible, until the journal burns from overheating (oil
removes the heat too, it's not just a lubricant).&gt;&gt; 
If your engine was running 0 clearance on all of the bearing surfaces it
wouldn't turn over--- 
OK, .0005&quot;. I was making a point, which you obviously missed. 
Funny thing--- 
on page 52 of my 1974 VW owner's manual is mentions; 
* When was this owners manual ACTUALLY WRITTEN? which is why I mentioned
the FACTORY RECOMMENDATION for lubricants in the 2002 aircooled cars.
