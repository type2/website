Subject: Re: [T2] fall/winter North Carolina oil

I'd tell you 10W-40. 10W-30 if your engine is tight.

I'd just watch the oil pressure and see that is stays about the same and 
the engine is noisier from knocking rods or flopping pistons.

&gt;But, I just moved to NC and am not familiar with the fall winter temps here.
&gt;
&gt;So, I am looking for recommendations for which weight to use during the
&gt;fall/winter months in and around Chapel Hill, NC in a 79 westy with a rebuilt
&gt;engine. I am currently using 20-50. This is my daily driver and I like to
&gt;drive a lot, with occasional road trips.
