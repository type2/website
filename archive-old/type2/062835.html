Funny! How many degrees of comfort can you get from a warm dipstick?

Oh, sorry....it's not Friday anymore   ;)

&gt; It's a beautiful,clear sunny day, the bus is running well.  I tried the
&gt; dipstick test last night after going out just for the crack....and I
could
&gt; hold it quite comfortably...I take a degree of comfort from this...
