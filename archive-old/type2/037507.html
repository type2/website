Subject: Re: adjusting hand brake

The trick to adjusting the hand brake is to loosen the cables completely,
then adjust the brake shoes, then adjust the cables.  If you can't adjust
the shoes, (the adjusting star wheels are bad about seizing up), don't try
to compensate by adjusting the cables, it makes the brakes work really
weird.
