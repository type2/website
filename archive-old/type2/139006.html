&gt; Has anyone actually had the oil filter fall off on any car they've owned?


I did, almost. I was driving from toronto to buffalo, NY, and lost oil
pressure. I shut off the engine and pulled off the busy highway immediately
and found that the back of the bus was covered in oil. I filled the
crankcase with oil and started off again the last 2 or 3 miles of my
journey. At my friend's house we investigated and found that the oil filter
was nearly threaded all the way off the mount. I was glad to find this,
rather than something more serious. No damage was done, but it was a real
shocker.
