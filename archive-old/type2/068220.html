Subject: RE: V8 engine stand answers + question

Once you strip off all the ancillary stuff, all you need to get a VW
engine up on a stand is one person (besides yourself) who can deadlift
75 pounds or so.  But that's usually one more than I have, and besides
I've been doing Porsche engines rather than VW in the last few years.

So I mounted my engine yoke less than 2 feet off the floor, at the max
height of my transmission jack.  At that height I can still turn the
engine upside down, and I can work on it seated rather than standing up.
The JCW engine yoke is not strong enough for the Porsche engine by itself
(and in fact I wouldn't trust it with a VW engine with heat exchangers
and flywheel) so I have a comealong down from the ceiling and either the
jack or the comealong holds the rear (FIF) of the engine while the yoke
holds the front.
