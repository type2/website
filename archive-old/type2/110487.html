&gt; Yes, you can get away with it.  I have never greased the input shaft
splines and I've never had a problem.  In fact, I can't see why anyone
would want to do it.  The splines just go into the clutch disc and stay
there.

The disk does slide back and forth on the splines so a tiny bit of lube is
good.  However, I've put many cars together dry and never had a problem.

Too much lube is a very bad thing.  Greases the clutch.
