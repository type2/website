Subject: Re: [T2] type 4 case oil pressure relief

Richard,

How much work did you do on the oil pump.

New?, check actually gear clearance as per Bentley?

Did you make sure that the cover was absolutely flat and without 
gear marks in it?  Did you use the correct cover gasket?...the one that is 
not much thicker than a piece of note book paper?

After those are correct, then it is all about bearing clearance and wear.

As a side note, I had to change an oil pump out on a T1 engine last 
weekend.  Previous pump seemed to be doing well, but after I went thru the 
one that I was going to put on and &quot;blueprinted&quot; it as discussed above it 
worked very well.  Engine has about 25,000 miles on it.  

Cold cranking it to get oil pressure(without starting) on a 70 degree day 
and then stopping got me 18 seconds of wait time before the oil light came 
back on from the pressure drop.

Your Mileage May Vary

Personally, I would consider 11psi at 700 rpm and 190f oil to be well 
within the good to excellent range.  At 1000 rpm I would expect the
pressure to come up a little more...


Cheers, dave

&gt; Hi all,
&gt; just a follow up on my low pressure issues, I have run the motor now with a spacer 
&gt; under the relief spring, results look promising.
 The extra pressure on the spring means I get reasonable pressure on the gauge 
 now (~40psi _at_2500rpm &amp; 190F oil). Max pressure at start up is ~60psi, so not too 
 bad.
 What it has not affected though is idle pressure, which is now ~11psi _at_700rpm &amp; 
 190F oil.
&gt; So I guess that means some excess clearance on the bearings?
&gt; 
&gt; What pressure would you normally expect on a new motor at idle with hot oil?
&gt; 
&gt; Cheers,
&gt; Richard
