&gt;Subject: Bus for rent?
&gt;Date: Sat, 5 Dec 1998 17:33:04 -0700
&gt;
&gt;I am hosting a new year's eve party and the theme is the 1960's.  I 
would
&gt;like to rent a VW Bus and park it in my backyard for the night (simply 
a
&gt;party prop).  Sounds like you have a large network of bus owners.  Can 
you
&gt;help me out?  I live in Arizona.  Can you put me in contact with 
someone in
&gt;Arizona who has a bus?  Any help would be appreciated.  Thank you in
&gt;advance.
&gt;
&gt;Spencer Cashdan
