&gt;
&gt;I've a 1956 Single Cab in pretty nice shape (no foundational rust, just
&gt;some surface stuff, etc), 6-volt, '58 engine. I found a TYPE IV engine
&gt;for $200 and thought I'd take the plunge into more horsepower. Am I
&gt;going to have to hog out the existing bell housing to accomodate the
&gt;bigger flywheel, or am I looking at buying nother transaxle?  This is my
&gt;first attempt at doing something radical to the little sweetheart and
&gt;I'm not about to do any sheetmetal work in the engine compartment.
&gt;
&gt;Thanks for the advice.
