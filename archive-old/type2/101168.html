Subject: Re: [T2] Praise for Bus Depot (Longish)

Let's admit it, Bus Depot has some really nifty stuff which you can't get
elsewhere. They also have low prices.

However, there's a question of setting expectations.

I recently griped about Bus Depot on RAMVA after learning that they had not
processed either of my 2 orders after about a week or so. The excuse was that
(a) they had 350 other orders ahead of mine, (b) they don't stock a lot of the
items.

I had something like $1000 in the 2 orders.

The fact is that Bus Depot's internet ordering system is antiquated by today's
standards. 

California Import Parts may not stock every item. But at least their website
appears to provide a realtime indication of when an item is in stock. Rocky
Mountain Motorworks' website also appears to do the same. Also, if the item is
a special order item, they tell you that.

Bus depot's website does none of that as far as I can tell. 

So you order something, thinking that you'll get it really fast and then they
tell you that they have to special order it from VWoA.....and your vehicle is
on jackstands.....

IMHO, if an item is not within your 4 walls, the item is OUT OF STOCK. PERIOD.
And the website should indicate that. Anything else is dishonest.

Bus Depot needs to set honest expectations!

Right now, I order mainly from CIP if I want the item fast. For parts for the
next vehicle that I'll be getting next year, I'll order from BD.

Anyway,my parts buying saga from BD is not ended. They had some parts drop
shipped and I got most of the rest late last week. Some minor parts are still
missing.
