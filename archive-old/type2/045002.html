Are you sure this is an actual, genuine, Westfalia camper conversion?

A 1971 VW Westfalia &quot;Campmobile&quot; should have a stainless steel combination
sink/countertop, formed to fit over the sides of the sink/icebox unit and
fastened with screws that go into the sides of the cabinet.  The only
openings in the top of this assembly would be the obvious sink drain hole,
and the openings for the pump and it's mounting screws.

&gt;&gt;  Any sources for a replacement for the plastic one piece sink for a '71
westy.  This is not the cover, but actually the sink itself which fits onto
the 3/4 inch ply top of the cabinet.  As a last resort - I will fabricate
one with a small RV aluminum sink and a laminate type surround.  &lt;&lt;
