Subject: Re: [T2] Where to buy fuel line clamp

*http://tinyurl_dot_com/8ohcq is one.You could use a &quot;reserve tank&quot; valve 
from an old beetle, or a valve off an old pickup truck that has dual 
tanks. I purchased that type new and installed it on my van. This also 
gives me the ability to drain the tank or put fuel into another 
container easily.
First four pics on this website show my installation:

&gt;Can you point me to any suitable valves? Presumably they need to be
&gt;specially rated for fuel use?
