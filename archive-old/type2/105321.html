Subject: heater boxes

is there a trick to getting the heater boxes back onto the head??? I have 
tried for almost an hour and I can not get it on. Ive tried wd40, and some 
emery paper to smooth things out but i just cant get it back on. Is it just 
going to take more time or is there some trick that someone knows. I have a 
72 bus and the engine is in. Anyone have any tips?? Or if i just cant get it 
back on, is there some alternative to the heater boxes?? I know that type1 
engines have j-tubes, do the type4 engines have something like that?? Thanks 
for any support you guys can give me.

Joey
