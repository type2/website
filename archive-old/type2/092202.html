Subject: Re: [T2] Timing

Wrong!!!!  The light goes off.  The spark is induced in the high tension
side of the coil by the collapse of the magnetic field created by the
12v current flowing into it when the points are closed. OPen the points,
the field collapses and the ignition spark happens. Read all about it here.

I ain't an expert on all things VW, but I do *know* Kettering ignition.

VW boxer engines &amp; distributors turn CW.

Turning the distributor body in the direction of rotation makes it fire 
later (retarded). Turning it against the rotation makes it fire earlier 
(advanced). The easiest way to check the direction of rotation is to 
grab the rotor and give it a twist. The mechanical advance is *into* the 
direction of rotation. Thus, if you can turn the rotor CCW, the 
distributor rotates CW. (Otherwise, it would be called mechanical retard 
rather than mechanical advance.) Ditto with the vacuum canister.  Take a 
look at it. If you look at it such that the attaching point of the 
cannister is at the top of the distributor, if the can is to the left, 
the distributor turns CW. If it's on the right it turns CCW. The 
cannister is going to pull the point plate against the rotation of the 
shaft. Hence, &quot;vacuum ADVANCE&quot;.

Hope that this clears thing up.

 &gt; Steve- I am sure I read your question wrong but...if I am not mistaken-
 &gt; as you rotate the crankshaft pulley clockwise to 7.5 the timing light
 &gt; should go on.  That means good to go.  I have always static timed my
 &gt; bugs and busses (66 bug, 67 bug, 67 convert, 73 bug, 69 bus and 70
 &gt; westy) and have no had any problems in the 12 years I have done this.  I
 &gt; know I will get alot of crap for this but I have always followed Muir
 &gt; with no problems.  Now if my memory is still ok...if you rotate the
 &gt; distributor clockwise you advance and counterclockwise you retard.
