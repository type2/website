Subject: Oil dipstick with temperature gauge

Hi All,
    In a post from Scott Lyons titled &quot;Engine stand&quot;, he mentions a
vendor named Mainely Custom by Design Inc.,  Porsche Speciality Parts.
While browsing through their site I see they sell oil temp. dipsticks.
You can find them listed on page
http://www.mainelycustombydesign_dot_com/enginecomponents.htm   I'm
wondering if anyone here has any experience with this product and
would share their opinion of it

Thanks in advance
