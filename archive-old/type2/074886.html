Subject: Re: [T2] Wanted: Bus Towbar


Yep----

And I found this all out just like a dummy-----

I flat towed a Buick Special to Florida, from Chicago, back in the late
70's without taking the driveshaft out.

Got there just fine----But when I went to drive the car--- all the 2
speed trans could do was---WIRRRRRRRRRRR.

Hmm, I says to myself--&quot;musta cooked the trans.&quot; :&gt;( 

Another fine learning experience, in my youth-----

Later,

Terry

Flat towing an automatic anything without the axles, driveshaft removed,
will guarantee, a fried pump in the trans. 

and EVERY auto tranny that I have had go out has been a failed tranny
pump. =A0 and it is VERY VERY diffcult to repair/replace as it is all
the way at the back (front) of the tranny, every other part has to be
removed. 
wonder how many had been towed in an earlier life.
