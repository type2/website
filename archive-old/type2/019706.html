&gt;     All right, before I get lynched all my comments were tongue in cheek and
&gt; many based on Nikki's own observations. So let it be known that Nikki and I
&gt; are friends &lt;gulp&gt; and I was happy that it was her that was able to save
&gt; another bus from the crushers. Let it further be known that we all, SO, kids
&gt; and Nikki spent most of the day making sure the bus was transported safety
&gt; and followed that up with A&amp;W floats on the way home to have a nice dinner.
&gt; My son has decided that Nikki is his girlfriend, so in a way, she has already
&gt; been taken home to mom. Okay put down the rope!

And I'm not even holding a gun to his head! ;-)

Nikki
