&gt; Hey all...
&gt;
&gt; I'm usually pretty good at figuring things out myself, but I'm stumped on
&gt; this one. My points keep fouling after 50 - 100 miles.
&gt;
&gt; Here's what I have...
&gt;
&gt; (71?) Mexican 1600 w/Pict 30/31 Carb (new carb)
&gt; 009 Distributor
&gt;
&gt; What I've done...
&gt;
&gt; 1. New plugs, points, condensor, coil, wires, cap, rotor about 5 months ago
&gt; with less than 2000 miles since.
&gt;
&gt; 2. Broke down last month, replaced points (fried) and plugs (black) --
&gt; everything else looked good. Plugs were black due to old carb problems --
&gt; didn't replace plugs w/new carb install.
&gt;
&gt; 3. Broke down last week. Thought it was a fuel issue, but turned out to be
&gt; points -- replaced. Checked plugs -- beautiful condition.
&gt;
&gt; 4. Broke down yesterday. Points had a little of that solder-looking stuff,
&gt; filed it off (didn't have a new set on-hand), re-installed and she ran fine.
&gt;
&gt; Other info...
&gt;
&gt; 1. The coil is not the Bosch Blue -- it's a black one from the local FLAPS.

Does it have an internal resistor?  Some coils are made to operate with an
external resistor that is bypassed while starting to improve the spark.

&gt; 2. Plugs are Bosch (regular, not &quot;super&quot;).
&gt;
&gt; 3. Rotor, cap and wires are from FLAPS.
&gt;
&gt; 4. Points are Bosch

You might also check the condensor.  The function of the condensor is to
prevent excessive arcing on your points.  New ones have been known to be
bad.

I'd replace the coil with a Bosch part and try again.
