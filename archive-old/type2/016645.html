       You don't say whether you have electric or manual pump -- if electric
(and this subject has been on the list at least twice in the last year) you
need a pressure regulator, or new float needles and seats nonwithstanding,
the too-high pressure of the pump will over power the floats. This is true
of most electric pumps on the market, especially the cheaper ones, and most
especially if you've converted to carbs from FI and are still trying to use
the FI pump.
       I had my '81 sitting for a year with a dead tranny and a tank full of
gas on a slope. It had no oil problem previously, and oil was at normal
level when parked. When I got it going again, it leaked oil quite badly -- I
checked the oil level, it was extremely over full, and very thin. Clearly,
in this case, parked on a slope, the gas seeped down into the engine.
