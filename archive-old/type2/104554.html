Subject: oil pressure and voltage

richard,

what kind of sender is that?

what voltage is more important to you?

voltage regulator? I might go here. most important things start off of here.

battery's another natural.

Billy

&gt;How do you tighten it up without removing the engine tin? The nut is at the bottom.
&gt;
&gt;Also, I was wondering where would be the most useful place to wire a voltage gauge? At the battery or up near the fuse box to see a voltage drop in the old wiring. Both?
