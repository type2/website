Subject: What torque setting for CV Joints?? 33 or 25 ft lbs

Karl said:
'Here is a handy 1977 info card you can print and laminate. It does not show 
gas tank size though:

Karl, I looked at that card, and it says . . . constant vel. joint: 4.5 mkg 
/ 33 ft lb.
I have been torquing my CV joints to 25 ft lbs... Am I wrong in this 
instance??

Here is support for both figures::

Clymer VW Transporter 1961-1979 Shop Manual ** Pg 29  10.  Install drive 
shaft &amp; tighten Allen bolts to 25 ft. lb. (3.5 mkg)

Haynes 1700/1800/2000 Transporter ** Ch 7 Pg 107 Torque Wrench Settings  * 
Driveshaft Flange Bolts   25 ft lbs  3.4 mkg

Bentley Official Service Manual ** Transmission and Rear Axle  Pg 6-7 3.2  
Remove and install CV joints  to install  10  torque the socket head 
screws to 3.5 mkg (25 ft. lb.).


BUT ! ! !

4. Tighten all six bolts snugly, then use the torque wrench to torque them 
to 33 ft. lbs.
