Subject: Carb Adjustment

List-
Just put a 1.8L with two carbs from another engine into  my 72 Westy. I
have adjusted the carbs as on page 57 of Haynes. It starts right up and
runs fine, but after it warms up and is turned off for a few minutes it
turns over but won't start again until it cools off. I don't think it is
overheating. I suspect the  &quot;mixture control screws&quot; (one on each carb) may
be off since the chokes seem to be operating fine and everything else
checks out. The screws are set at 2 1/2 turns out. If I want it richer do I
turn them out more? Do the screws control air or fuel?  I also don't have a
CO Analyser Meter and this thing is supposed to pass inspection tomorrow.
Any ideas? I'm working on it right now, send P-mail if you know.
Thank you all for your help, now and many times before.
