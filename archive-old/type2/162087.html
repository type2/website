Subject: Re: Gear Shifting Problems

&gt; I was driving home from work yesterday and realized it was difficult to shift into 1st and 2nd gear.  When I shifted into third gear, it wanted to grind unless I moved the shifter real slow.  4th gear had no problem.  This morning I was warming the bus up and now I can not shift into 1st or 2nd gear at all. When the engine is off, I can engage the gears no problem, but when the engine is on, no go.  My clutch cable doesn't have too much play or too little play so I don't think that is the problem.   
&gt; 

My first guess is the pilot shaft bearing is tight against the pilot shaft,, 
the shaft is still spinning while your trying to change gears. 

That can happen if your cable has too much play... 

put it in 1st... start the engine and drive away
pull it out of first.. and push towards 2nd.. hold the shifter gently 
towards 2nd as you blip the rev.s and you'll feel it want to enter 2nd...
push it into 2nd at that point.
do the same with 3rd... and 4th 

You can drive the bus without using the clutch if you can get that feel when 
it wants to enter the next gear.. 

anyway... that will tell you the gears are all working,, and you have a 
problem between the engine and the trans... 

something that makes the shaft spin when it is supposed to be still.
seized pilot shaft bearing
build up of clutch debris in the pressure plate... 

you will have to pull the engine to find out for sure.
