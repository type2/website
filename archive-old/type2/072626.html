Subject: cooling vane minutiae
Message-Id: &lt;v01510108b3631414efee_at_[207.172.43.81]&gt;

The following might be of interest to only the most retentive among us.  It
concerns the opening and closing of the cooling vanes in response to the
thermostat opening and closing.

I'm deep in the process of rebuilding a 1776 and I have the fan housing on
the workbench.  I'm pushing/pulling on the vane connecting link and
watching the motion of the vanes from fully open to, well, not fully open.
I hesitate to say closed because the definition of fully closed is not
clear to me.

The outermost two vanes  -  defined for today as the right-most and the
left-most  -  look like they might define the limits of the stroke.  Each
has a rubber nib pressed into it and my guess is that this nib slamming
against a metal stop is what defines the endpoints of the stroke.

On mine, the &quot;fully closed&quot; limit is determined by the nib on the
right-most vane slamming against a stop. The &quot;fully open&quot; position  is
determined by the left-most vane slamming against two of the bolts which
hold the assembly in the housing. The nib of this one never hits anything.


Can anyone describe the motion and endpoint stops of these vanes so I can
tell if mine are installed properly?

Thanks much.
Jack
