Subject: RI bus report - long

Just wanted to report on a champagne edition 78 Camper I went and looked 
at. I read about it on the list and it wasn't what I was looking for but 
someone else might be interested. The original post was:

Someone buy this thing before I'm tempted to look at it myself :)&quot;

Well I went and looked at it. It is a very nice solid bus, but not 
&quot;totally rust free&quot; which is what I was looking for. It was in very good shape, like 95% solid with no serious rust, but 
compounding the rust that was there was the guy had freshly painted it 
without doing a good job fixing the minor rust. He should have either done 
it right or not painted it. The worst was under the windshield seal there 
was rust. But the guy didn't remove the windshield  when he painted the 
bus! he said he lifted the seal and scraped the rust out and put some rust 
converter on it, but I knew from seeing how my Tennessee bus looked under 
there that there was still rust and the windshield would have to come out 
to fix it right. It also had badly repaired rust in both front steps, some 
on the rockers, and in the battery trays. The front beam was solid with 
some rust starting at the bottom of the towers. Behind the front wheels 
the place where all the little panels come together, the sealer was 
popping out so there was rust starting there. The bottoms of the doors 
were all solid with just tiny patches of surface rust, the rear vent wing 
bottom pivot was history.

I was concerned primarily with the body, but the interior was in good 
shape, some wear and tear, some of the black trim was shrunk and or 
melted, no chips in the laminate tho. Closet door handle was busted. The 
propane tank valve leaked unless it was closed or open all the way, the 
fridge worked, child cot, front 1 legged table and dash clock were there, 
but the rear table was a beige vanagon table instead of the &quot;cherry&quot; 
Formica. The ignition switch stopped craning the engine so he had added a 
starter button to the dash. All the seals were in decent shape but 
original.

I did NOT test drive the bus so I can't tell you how the drive train, 
suspension, steering was. It had a bastardized engine in it, 72-75 exhaust 
on a &quot;good used engine&quot; that started right up, FI was there but looked a 
little different then my 78 set up. It had the hydraulic lifter sticker on 
the shroud but I didn't verify that it was a 78 engine.  The owner said he 
had replaced the pushrod tube seals and front and rear seals on engine. 
Needed fuel filler neck and probably gas lines. Needs correct tires all 
around.

If I didn't have my camper already, which is about 80-85% rust free, I 
would have bought it. It certainly was in better shape then mine, 
excellent shape for a bus you would find in the NE, but not so incredible 
it justified going through the process of swapping engines, selling my old 
camper and then spending $1000+ to get this new bus to 100%. That would 
entail cleaning up the undercarriage which had some surface rust in spots, 
doing the windshield area, doing the front steps and doing the battery 
trays and then touching up the paint. 

I want to warn you that what I consider good or decent is probably 
different then what a lot of you do. I use my bus for camping so I was 
looking for utility and solidness, not cosmetics. YMMV. But if your 
looking for a good bus to restore in the northeast this is worth a look. 
It does need to be restored and gone through tho.
