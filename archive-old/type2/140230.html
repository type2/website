Subject: Re: [T2] #3 intake tightening up

 I have new Brazilian VW brand(VW Audi symbol on the casting) single port 
heads with about 2500 miles on them so far. Seems the valve clearances are 
tight every time I check them, and that's all the valves. Is this normal for 
new heads to work in, with initial stretch, or are the crappy South American 
valves slowly failing?
I think I read some advice somewhere to take new heads and get new, high 
quality valves put in em. Any advice here?

&lt;Probably true, but .100 inch is a lot of .006 valve tightenings!
Remember, after the valve stretchs to the point where the valve gap is
zero, there is no force left to stretch the valve.  It'll burn the valve
and seat, but it won't stretch any more!
