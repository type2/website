        Any Californians here having trouble passing the 2500 rpm test
        for CO %

        My 71 poptop with a stock everything engine is running great 20
        mph _at_ 55mph, 180-200 oil temp, but California is telling me that
        I am way over on CO (there was no 2500 rpm test in 71 so how
        would they know what is correct anyway)

        I have been told to jet the main down to .122 to pass and then
        put the .127 back in to prevent LEAN-BURN.

        All help on this most welcome - DMV gave me a 30 day extention,
        but it goes fast when you got to work and play too!!!!!
