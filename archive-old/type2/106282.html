&gt; when cold, the valve is open.  i took it out an looked at it and the
opening
&gt; in a slot in a plate.  the plate moves to close the valve when hot?

Yes, the opening should be closed up when the valve is hot.  Check this by
running the engine until it's completely warmed up.  Shut it down and
disconnect the hose from the air intake elbow to aux air valve at the air
intake elbow end.  Try to blow air through the hose and into the air
distribution box.  You should not be ablt to do so.

&gt; even
&gt; when cold, the valve is not open to a round hole, only to the slit in the
&gt; plate.  should this be totally open so you can see a round hole?

No.  Repeat the same test as above with the engine stone cold.  You should
be able to blow air easily into the air distribution box.  Perhaps the aux
air valve is not opening wide enough and is affecting your cold idle, but I
don't know, actually, what &quot;wide enough&quot; is.  I went down to my cold garage
and looked through an aux air valve that was working OK when removed and I
could see daylight through about 1/3rd of the area of the round hole.  If
you're seeing a lot less daylight than this perhaps the aux air valve isn't
opening up enough.  Maybe someone on the list can describe how much daylight
you should see through a &quot;wide open&quot; aux air valve.
