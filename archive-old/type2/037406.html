Peter,

The seal certainly is important and contributes non-trivially to efficient
cooling, but I don't believe it is *solely* responsible for the engine's
quick demise. I would stick to that statement even if you had driven the bus
in the summer! Since you drove it during the cooler months of the year (and
I take it you're in Canada, too), I am confident that something else must be
amiss. Assuming the engine did indeed overheat (are you convinced of that?),
my guess would be that it was running lean. A cracked or missing vacuum hose
will do that.

What I also find eyebrow-raising is that compression is low on all cylinders
and it probably was low before the sudden loss of power associated with
cylinder #1 going dead. Maybe all valve seats started dropping at roughly
the same pace (a bit unlikely) OR maybe the engine just wasn't put together
right.

You may want to contact VWoA customer service (1.800.822.8987) and ask them
to reconsider their decision not to stand behind the first dealer's
workmanship and not to foot the bill for the repair. If that fails, you
might perhaps have recourse to arbitration.

Sami
