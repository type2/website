Subject: Berg oil sensor thingy

When I bought my bus, I put in a 
Burg oil sensor.

 

Basically, it allows 2 tabs to be connected to the oil sensor.

 

One goes to the OEM oil lamp, the other goes to a pre stated screw on my tin
over the #3 cylinder.

 

It is a bimetallic sensor.

 

I proved it was the sensor when I disconnected the burg one and just had the
normal sensor in place. Bus started flawlessly. Light for the oil was off
right away.

 

Do these sensors age?

 

Alan
