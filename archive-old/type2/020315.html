&gt;It's Friday so can anyone explain the strange behaviour _at_ shows (at least
&gt;here in the UK).

they do that here in the US too and personally it makes me cringe!!! I have
seen a rather nice bug crushed and trashed, it had no engine but was otherwise
in very good shape, hell if someone wanted to trash it they should have given
it to me i would have treated it nice! if i see someone do this to a bus i will
never go to a show again, i want nothing to do with people who enjoy hurting
something i love.. Its like going to an art gallery and having someone tear up
master pieces for the entertainment of the patrons.  But i think people are
destructive by nature, like going to monster truck rallys to watch a truck
crush cars, or guitarists smashing their guitars on stage ( as a musician this
alway irked me) &quot; hehe hehe smashing stuff is cool. yeah yeah smash it smash
it!!&quot;
hope i didn't offend anyone, though if you're on this list i'm sure you
understand me not liking to see veedubs hurt.
jamie


why destroy when you can restore!!!
