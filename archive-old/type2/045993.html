Subject: [T2] Fuel Pump Storage?

I pulled the fuel pump on my '71 Campervan (w/ Alternator), only 
to find that it was the fuel-pump pushrod that was bad and I'm
assuming that the pump is probably still good.  That said, I had
intended to keep a spare fuel pump on hand, and I figured I'd just
put the new pump on (since I have it) and keep the 2nd one for 
a spare (that's the old one).  A friend mentioned that the diaphram
might dry out and become useless since it's already been exposed to
gasoline for such a long time, were I to  store it ( giving me a 
false sense of security at having a &quot;spare&quot; and taking up room).

So, I could just put the old one back into service and keep the 
new one in the box as a spare, or, I could devise some way of keeping
the old pump sealed so it wouldn't dry out if this is truely a 
concern...  Any thoughts on whether I should be worried about the
pump's diaphram drying out if I were to store it?

thanks,
