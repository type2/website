Also, the camper had a small
table in it, with a center post and two &quot;catches&quot; on one side.  What does it
hook to or where does it hook?

On my 1975 Westy, this table rests over the shifter on two little catches on
the dash.  Center post fits nicely on the floor, and presto!  Lunch table!
(Obviously, not for use while in motion...)

Glad to hear that you're getting so much enjoyment out of your Westy --
hoping to put mine back in order this summer...
