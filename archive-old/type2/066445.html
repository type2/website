Subject: split spare gas can

I've located a nice spare gas can for a bus.  It fits in the spare tire and
is circular with grooves on the sides.  Was this an option on split window
buses?  And does it fit with both locations of the spare tire, in the rear
and behind the driver's seat?  What years was it offered on?

It's going for around $100.

Also, I found some NOS ambulance or fire engine blue lights for around $100.
Anyone interested?

I also have a very nice german first aid kit.  It's packed with stuff.  It
looks like it came out of a 70's camper from the looks of it.  It's a green
box whith detail lettering in German on the front describing what's in it.
I'm keeping this for myself.
