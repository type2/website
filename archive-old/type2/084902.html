Subject: Re: [T2] where to buy a new engine?

Buy another engine if you must but don't sell the bus and start over - at 
least you know this engine.

Pursue the warranty repair. Tell them the weld did not case the case to 
crack but was a response to fix it.

It may take a male to make the point b/c unfortunately we are still in the 
dark ages it seems when dealing with service people and car dealers.

You could clean the weld up with a sander and when you apply for a 
replacement tell them that the mechanic used a sander to clean the metal to 
ensure it was in fact a crack and not a rough edge left over from the 
casting process at the factory.

If it is just leaking then clean it up with a sander and then JB Weld it. 
If the crack gets worse then you have not lost any money. The JB may hold 
it closed.

Why is the crack a problem? If it is leaking then I understand. Is your 
mechanic attributing some other problem - rough running? - to this crack?

I'm not sure you need a new engine yet.

&gt;Hi-
&gt;
&gt;I need advice. (actually- premature advise, as I don't have all my facts in
&gt;yet.)
&gt;
&gt;I bought the van with a newly rebuilt engine from 'cross country.  (mistake,
&gt;but camper van's on the east coast are fairly scarce)  The PO put a lot of
&gt;money into this engine.
&gt;
&gt;The case is cracked.  The warranty may  replace the case, which is very new,
&gt;except that my  mechanic here brought it to a welder to try to fix the
&gt;crack - which didn't work - and now the case is &quot;scarred&quot;, and I will
&gt;probably have trouble with the replacement as I have probably voided my
&gt;warranty.  I plan to talk to the owner of where the engine was purchased,
&gt;but he is out today. Hence my letter to you.
&gt;
&gt;The mechanic here says that even if I get a new case, there will be quite a
&gt;bit of labor involved transfering everything over.  At $85/hour, this will
&gt;add up quickly.  I am in no position to do the work myself.
&gt;
&gt;I am looking for comments on the above, and also wondering which company you
&gt;would recommend if I purchase a new, replacement engine.  It seems like a
&gt;new one would run around  $1000 - 1200 (?), plus installation.  I think I
&gt;may be better off swallowing my losses and starting fresh.
&gt;
&gt;Any help would be appreciated.
&gt;
&gt;thanks-
&gt;
