Subject: Re: [T2] Can you boil a Carb?

&lt;&lt; I have taken my dual carb solex apart (on my 72 1700cc) and given them 
&gt; a good cleaning. I have used steel wool, wire brush and solvent. The 
&gt; passages will be blown with compressed air soon. But there are some 
&gt; hard to get spots that I can't get to. So I was wondering if I could 
&gt; boil (maybe with some bleach or vinegar)the carb? Will this clean the 
&gt; carb or harm it? Has anyone tried this with any success?
 &gt;&gt;

Try Googlin' up &quot;Safety-Kleen&quot;...I've got about a three quarts left from
a late and lamented carb rebuilding shop. The local FLAPS should have
a gallon container with a wire basket for soaking small parts overnite
(or longer... ;-(
