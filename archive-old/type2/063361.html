Subject: asbestos in VWs?

I just read this on Funkengroovin

What You Should Know About Vintage Bugs and Buses....


We discovered that the heater exchange units belonging to all old buses
with air cooled engines
and heating shut-off valves of bugs are manufactured using asbestos.

We have also discovered that there are non-asbestos parts available,
however, to obtain these
parts you must write to:

                             VW of America, Inc.
                              600 Sylvan Avenue
                             Englewood Cliffs, NJ

We believe that it is VW's responsibility to exchange the asbestos units
for non-asbestos units at
no cost to the VW owner. As long established owners of VW's we have
experienced success in
obtaining these units at no cost.

If you would like additional information regarding this issue please
feel free to FAX us at: (415)
472-2634 Regards, Jurgen &amp; Kathleen
