Subject: Part Wanted - Manifold for single IDF Weber

I'm looking for a manifold for a type 1 motor that will allow me to mount a 
single Weber 40 IDF (I've already got the carb).  Also looking for 1 air filter 
housing for said IDF.  If you've got one and want to see it gone, drop me an e-
mail.

Thanks.
