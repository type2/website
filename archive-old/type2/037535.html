Subject: Breather Tube?

Thanks to Tom and Jed for your help so far with my 80 vanagon, FI engine
where abouts.  I'm not sure I located the breather tube properly.  The
Haynes Manual I have does not picture or label this part anywhere.  I
know I really need to get a Bentley.  Time to call the bus depot.
However, the part in question:  I have two clear tubes on the passenger
side of the engine.  One is connected to the air filter box just before
the AFM.  This tube runs to a long cylindrical part located inside the
rear wheel well.  The other tube returns from this part back to the
engine.  From here I know where not it goes?!?
