Personal opinion...  worth exactly what you are paying for it...

I'd rather have a junkyard stocker than a new 009.  Better yet, a hall effect
distributor from a '81-'82 Vanagon.  If VW could have gotten away with
eliminating the vacuum advance unit and saved a couple of bucks per unit, they
would have.

Another point...  without the correct distributor in the van, it will not pass
California smog and will be unregisterable.  You MUST have the correct
emissions equipment and the distributor is part of it.
