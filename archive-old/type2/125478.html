Subject: Re: [T2] Jack

Ever had the stock jack sink right into hot ashphault?  I have and had to
get a hammer to get it back out, while it was still attached to the stock
jack point.  If you ar eoging to use the stock jack, I recommend carrying a
piece of wood or something to help disperse some of the weight.

Also if anyone is interested I have a stock jack I would be willing to part
with...
