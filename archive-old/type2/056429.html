Subject: Mexico Trip Preparations

Hey All!
I'm going to be taking my 79 camper on a month-long roadtrip from Oregon
down to the tip of the Baja California peninsula in October (our first
major roadtrip together), and was wondering what kinds of vehicle
preparations any of you can recommend.  This will be consist of some long
hot desert travel but we'll be sticking to Mex Highway 1 the whole way --
no off-roading and no driving at night, of course.  I'm interested what you
think I'll need in terms of &quot;must-have&quot; tools, spare parts, accessories,
pre-departure services &amp; checkups, and anything else you can think of that
I would definitely need to do, have done, or possess for such a trip.  If
you've done this trip before, any other related wisdom or tips you can
throw in would be greatly welcomed and appreciated as well.

Also, anybody out there gonna be (or wannabe) bussing into Baja in early
October?  I'm always open to caravaning down with fellow VWers -- safety in
numbers, you know.  Let me know...  Thanks!
