David I cant understand this.
You would never be able to run a vacuum only distributor then.


&gt; Not correct as I understand it.  I was guilty at one time of believing the
&gt; above but Karl convinced me otherwise.  Here is the truth:
&gt;
&gt; 1.  Manifold vacuum is the ultimate source of vacuum advance. **
&gt; 2.  Vacuum created by the venturi effect has no significant effect on
&gt; vacuum advance.
&gt; 3.  At WOT (wide open throttle), measured vacuum advance *and* manifold
&gt; vacuum will both go to ZERO.
