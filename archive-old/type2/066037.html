Subject: Smog Check Engine Change Success (long)

Just finished the entire process and thought it was time to post the 
events.  (swirly time machine music please)  Back a few months ago I 
was faced with spending several hundred dollars to replace/buy new 
various parts for my '80 non-CA Westi.  An '80 Westi became available 
in Palo Alto CA from a post to this list for $750.  After many, many 
weeks of communications and a 210 mile trip to check out the bus, we 
concluded the deal at $400 (wasted trans, leaky case, interior shot).

More weeks passed with removal of parts from the new CA 
equipped bus commenceing.  Cleaning, replacing hoses, making diagrams, 
checking part numbers (thanks to the Bosch FI info on the 'net) etc.
Finally got set and tore down non-CA and moved all CA stuff including 
all exhaust components, a couple of pieces of tin, most FI stuff, 
etc.  Needed a Idle Stabilizer ($150 yikes), hadn't planned on that 
one.  Fixed vacuum leaks, etc.  Thanks to all for assistance.

Anyway on to the smog part of this saga.
Took it to my trusted mechanic and did a pre-test on it a couple of 
times to sort out leaks and such.  Appeared to pass without a hitch.

Here's where it starts to answer some previously posted questions.
To smog a vehicle the smog tech checks the engine compartment tag to 
identify the vehicle.  Keying that into the smog computer results in 
a list of components and stuff to check.  Since I made an engine 
change from non-CA to CA the *stuff* was different, they couldn't 
start the testing.  It had to be taken to the Smog Referee to check 
that the engine change resulted in what I claimed it now was.
Made appointment (got through in about 5 minutes, pleasant person,
appointment 2 weeks hence).  Arrived about 20 minutes early to be 
informed that their machine was not working, and wasn't sure when it 
would be (long nasty letter about that experince due to smog people 
from that *conversation*).

Got another appointment, at a different
station (same parenthetical comments as above, hmm, thought I would 
save bandwidth with that dittoing of previous comments, blew that)
Arrived at appointment 20 minutes early.  Eventually got vehicle in 
for check.  I had prepared for this by having Bently and Haynes 
flagged with exhaust pictures to show the various Aircooled Vanagon 
configurations and sketch I had made of the hoses and FI stuff 
including both CA and non-CA.  Had 3 Smog Techs on this; Experienced 
One, Somewhat Experienced One, and First Day On Job One.

While they were discussing engine, I placed myself as close as 
barrier would allow and eventually offered my manuals to them.  EO 
looked an books and sketch, others didn't.  SEO couldn't figure out 
how to check timing.  I coached FDOJO on license plate door and 
cautioned about hooking up to hot lead on coil for power.  Finally 
passed without any problems, other than it took 2 hours.  As a 
result of all this they then applied a new sticker to the engine 
compartment that officially described the engine change so that in 
the future this could be checked by any station.  
BTW saw a letter posted in waiting room:  If oil dipstick shows that 
more than one quart of oil is needed, they can't check vehicle.  How 
are we ordinary folks supposed to know this stuff?

Other events at station.  Kid with dune buggy: '59 pan, '65 engine, 
PO declared it as a '94 special build.  Second time in for smog.  
Couldn't figure out what it should have, but of course it didn't have 
the right stuff, failed.  Guy with service truck.  There when I arrived,
there when I left.  They had about 4 people swarming all over that 
truck the entire time, never did figure out what they were doing.
