Subject: Correction to &quot;Heads and numbers. . .

 There is an error in my post on heads and numbers.

 I want you to know I didn't do it deliberately.   :-)

 Maybe it was freudian tho.

 There are only 2 power strokes per revolution.

 Therefore  the heads are only getting hit with those pressures half the time.

 So instead of hit 4000 times per minute, it's only 2000 times per.

 That feels a lot better doesn't it?  :-)
