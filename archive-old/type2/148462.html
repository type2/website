A week or so ago, I asked and received advice on bus prices 
(c.f. &quot;Bay window market crash&quot;).  We ended up selling the '78 
Sunroof bus in good shape for $3200 locally.  I think it went 
to a good home, but it was hard to watch the bus drive off.  
We'll always have good memories, and you folks were very 
much a part of it.  Thanks for keeping us going!

If anyone here is interested in the following, 10% goes back to 
the list:

Green Bentley Manual (latest print with FI section, got wet but 
no smearing) $20 shipped

Muir Book (latest print, perfect shape) $15 shipped

Tranny drain Allen Wrench (17mm?, Craftsman, excellent) $7 
shipped

Craftsman Inductive Timing Light (nice chrome $50 one, used 
a handful of times) $35 shipped

Sun Digital &quot;Engine Analyzer&quot; CP7676 (tach/dwell/voltmeter 
tool, great shape w/battery, cables, manual) $25 shipped

all the best and happy bussing!
