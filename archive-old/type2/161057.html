&gt;  I'd like to bounce this off you guys just to make sure I  
&gt; understand this
&gt; correctly. There is a REVERSE switch attached to the transmission  
&gt; with TWO
&gt; wires coming off of it.

Correct.

&gt; What I'd like to know is, is this reverse switch basically just a  
&gt; regular old
&gt; switch? Does that switch complete the circuit between the two wires  
&gt; that come
&gt; off of it?

Yes. The resistance is infinite or zero. The switch doesn't ground  
either wire to the transmission case.

&gt; If that's the case, then that would mean that ONE of those wires  
&gt; would need to
&gt; connect to a positive source while the other would connect to the  
&gt; &quot;Y&quot; that
&gt; goes to the back-up tail-lights.
&gt;
&gt; Am I correct in understanding this?
&gt;
&gt; If I understand that correctly, then would the positive on the COIL  
&gt; be an
&gt; acceptable positive source for the back-up wire?

That's how the factory did it and is reflected in the wiring diagrams.

&gt; Oh! One other question, I noticed there is a second switch on the
&gt; transmission. I had been told that this switch is OPEN when the car  
&gt; is in 4th
&gt; gear. What would be the purpose of that switch? Nothing seems to be  
&gt; connected
&gt; to it, and I don't see anything about it in the Bentley manual?

See page 73 of Engine &amp; Clutch in Bentley. It's an electrically  
operated vacuum advance cutoff.
