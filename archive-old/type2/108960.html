&gt; Anybody seen the latest trailer for the new 'Hulk' flick?  I swear I'm
seeing an orange and white bay behind the beast in a rage!  Caught my eye,
even though it passes by really quickly.

Good eye, Eron.  You have to watch closely at the beginning of the trailer,
but it's there.  though I thought it looked like a splittie.  We're watching
the StarGate premier, and will probably see the trailer again before the
night's out.  Will try to get a better glimpse of it next time around.
