Subject: bench seat etc etc :)

Actually I read about the structure support from your on line brochure (love
that thing!) It stated that there is a continuous steel &quot;rollbar&quot; above the
rear passengers(I would assume at the outer lip of the rear over head
storage) and &quot;a similar structure protects the driver and passenger up
front&quot; . Similar structure doesnt make me feel as safe ..bbuutt....so it
goes. I would assume that the outer edge of the front and rear compartments
are made up of these two supports. Just past the overhead light in cab
area(towards hull) I hvnt seen pics of your interior so Im speaking of Blue
but I wouldnt think they could change the make up of the shell itself too
much. Like I said b4 that brochure is EXACTLY the way my bus is set up.
minus the two kids sleeping up front( theres gotta be a law against cramming
that little boy up there!) (pic)
(If you ever have any pics of wendelin send em too me!! :)
If this is wrong lemme know. I know nothing of the structure of our busses
just what I see in mine and where I would think they woud be.
