Subject: Re: [T2] Hydraulic lifters - mistake to replace?

On Tue, 18 May 2004, Ross Cupples wrote:

&gt; With the Hydraulic lifters, would I be making a mistake to invest the
&gt; time and money to replace all the lifters to shut the motor up, or
&gt; should I just live with the noise on startup and go for a rebuild in due
&gt; time?  I guess the nature of the Hydraulic lifters prevents cam wear,
&gt; but what about when they are failing?  I guess I'm curious as to others'
&gt; experience in the lifter department.

my understanding is that if the lifters are BRAND NEW NEVER USED it will
seat itself with no problems

&gt; At 10-15 bucks a pop it doesn't seem like a huge investment to go ahead
&gt; and replace all 8.  What do you folks think?  Thanks in advance,

I have had one of my lifters totally fail, broken spring. and have
replaced it and the matching lifter on the same cyl.  (hyd) on my 78 it
has been a couple years now and there appears to be no difference with the
others
