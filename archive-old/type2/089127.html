Subject: 77 bus for sale w/ 40k

I ran into someone who has a 77 westy with only 40,000 original miles.
He is asking $11,000 but told me he'd take $9,000.
It is located in Supply NC, which is b/n Wilmington and Myrtle Beach.
The body looked rust free, had a green paint job. the interior looked to be
in very good shape except for the sagging headliner.
I don't know much more than this, but he claims everything is original
including the fresh water hose.
