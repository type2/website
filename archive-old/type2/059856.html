John and the list,

With a balanced 1600dp, stock exhaust, I'd stick with the stock 34PICT3
carburetor.  Even with the 009, in an otherwise stock motor, stock exhaust,
I have not had the problem with the dreaded flat spot.  It's a lot easier to
set up than Webers, and you can try a slightly upped jet size if you feel
any trace of hesitation, stock is 127.5.  See my previous post on Solex
jets.  Good luck.
