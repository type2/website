That's exactly what I was getting at in my post about these manuals.

I have the manual scans on floppies, so could reload them and transmit them
by e-mail, but it takes a long time because the images are large files in
order to retain decent resolution.

I'm pretty sure someone on the List still has them up on a website, but lost
my record of just who
[and where, URL-wise] that might be.

&gt;&gt;  That would be great if you could post it on your site.  I've scanned and
emailed to those who requested it from me, but the file size is large
(bitmap) as I don't have the capability to convert it to .pdf.  So, emailing
it is a major pain in the b*tt.  &lt;&lt;
