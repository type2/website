Subject: Did anyone on the list used to own my bus???

Hello List,

I was just curious if anyone on the list used to own
my bus. I bought it from a Mr. Berton in Castle Hayne
in North Carolina. It is a 74 standard bus wiith
factory orange and white paint. This bus has a bench
seat in the front rather than 2 bucket seats. It has a
Bob Marley skull decal in the coner of the rear hatch
window. It had fairly little rust for a East coast bus
but the battery trey was rusted out. It has no rust
around the windshield. It may have been sold due to
transmission or engine trouble. When I bought it it
had a automatic tranny in it. It may or may not have
had a green painted roof when you owned it.

I was just curious if any one on the list used to own
my bus. Well, Have a great day!
