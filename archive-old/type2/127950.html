Subject: [T2]Synchronizer

does anyone have a lead on a synchronizer for synching up dual carbs... they usually run around 20 bucks from what i have heard at the local flaps stores but ever where i check around my area and beyond says whats that ?
OMG anyways.... if someone could point me in the right direction....?
i have also heard of people making them and such but being that i dont have an idea what the heck i am doing i would prefer to have a genuine synch tool so that i can get use to how to use it?
thanks abunch
chris


peace
