Class 8 trucks have a similar system--called a Kysor system--

Low oil--first a buzzer, then engine shut down--low coolant--same
thing---

Good safety measure---

Not a new concept---


Later,

Terry

Early Dodge trucks did it. Oil pressure was wired to the fuel pump so as
to keep drivers from running out of oil.

Subject: [T2] will it work? 
Hi all, 
I was wondering about whether it is possible to use the oil pressure
switch as a means for cutting out the points and saving the engine
if/when the oil pressure disappears ... 
Here's my theory ... add a wire from the pressure switch to the live
side of the points (at the coil say). When the oil pressure is nil, the
switch is closed and the points are effectively shorted out, so no
spark, no load on the motor, etc. And when you start up in the morning,
she won't fire until the oil pressure is up, which only takes a second
or two anyhows. That's gotta be good, right? 
The drawbacks as far as I can figger are that 
(a) the idiot light will probably glow while you drive (brightness will
be proportional to the dwell angle of the points), 
(b) the back-voltage from the coil/points might fry the idiot light, and 
(c) the coil might overheat if you leave the ignition on when the motor
isn't running (but you got this risk anyway if the points happen to be
closed when the motor stops) 
The first two problems can probably be overcome by strategically placing
a high-voltage diode in series with the wire from the oil switch to the
points. 
Has anyone ever tried this? Will it work?
