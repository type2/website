&gt; I'm not too sure this is correct bob. Section 5 page 49 of my bentley
&gt; says this:
&gt; note: &lt;excess stuff removed&gt; The oil seal must be seated squarely in
&gt; the crankcase recess

oil seal in engine block must be seated squarely in crankcase 

BUT

auto tranny torque converter seal is seated flush into auto tranny case


different seals
