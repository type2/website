I wasn't being presumptive at all---

I guess the point I was attempting to make was, if you can't afford the
proper procedures at this time ( which was suggested ) don't do it it
all, or at best apply something that won't cause any dismay, when the
time comes to do the job right.

If the thought was brought up to horrify other motorist's as he drove,
hell, I'd not only tar the vehicle in question, I'd feather it
too-----nobody would come close to it---

Hey!!--Another great idea!!

Get some Chia Pet grass, and smear it all over the Bus!!

Never see the rust, dents holes, whatever-- only would need a hair cut
once in awhile--and I almost for sure would guarantee, the Mercedes,
BMW's and the Lexus's mentioned would never get close to you !!!

Parking Lot insurance so to speak !!


Later,


Terry

[T2] Paint 
I believe Napa makes a rattle can primer/sealer that should work well to
cover any exposed metal you may have. The notion that you're better
doing nothing if you can't do it &quot;right&quot; is a bit presumptive. Not
everyone wants a $10,000 bus that will only provide $2,000 in insurance
coverage when you total it. I've got a bus that I painted in my driveway
with spray cans. The bus has lots of non stock modifications and various
duct tape/bailing wire fixes that work fine. Plus it passes the 20/20
rule: It looks good from 20 feet away or at 20 mph. I paid $800 for my
bus and have put another $800 into it. I can sell it for more than that
in a pinch, and it does what I want ... get me from point A to point B
reliably in a vehicle that I enjoy driving. The people who want
collectors cars won't get them painted at Maaco, but for those of us who
are saving to get the $199 paint job that will last 5 years, shaker cans
and Maaco are fine. Plus ugly primer, rust, and dents are good pasive
insurance -- the Lexxus and the pristine 63 Splitty will stay the hell
out of your way -- they've certainly got more to lose.
