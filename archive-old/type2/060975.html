Andrew, among other things, you asked:

&gt;Finally, is it ever possible that HC
&gt;levels are due to problems which can
&gt;be fixed by tuning?

Yes.  Excessive unburned hydrocarbons can result from too rich a mixture
and/or inadequate spark or improper spark timing, which cause incomplete
combustion.
