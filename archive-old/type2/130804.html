Subject: Re: [T2] Help! bus won't start after running out of gas

Hi Rick,

The FI fuel pump is cooled by the fuel flowing through it. They won't 
run dry for very long . Test for voltage at the pump: If it's getting 
power but not pushing fuel it's probably toast.

If it is the pump, I would suggest looking at alternative replacements 
that meet stock specs. The Vanagon/Bus fuel pump is rarely stocked by a 
local FLAPS, but a suitable replacement (ie, an external pump with the 
same flow and pressure rating, hose diameter and over-pressure 
shut-off) usually is and can save you a LOT of $$$.  The mid-80's 
bronco used a very similar pump and most mid-large suppliers would 
probably have one in stock. I was once quoted two days delivery and 
$200US for a vanagon pump vs.  immediate delivery and $115 for a 
comparable replacement with new filter. The trick is finding someone at 
the counter who is co-operative enough to help you find what you're 
looking for.

As they say: Your milage may vary.


Happy trails,

&gt; What does the fuel pump sound like? Smooth hum or more like hissing 
&gt; and spitting. A really noisy pump could be going bad (or the filter 
&gt; could be clogged). A weak fuel pump could have been overly stressed by 
&gt; being run very low on fuel.
