&gt; Hey Folks,
&gt;       Most (if not all) of the stuff I'm using (primers, paints, etc.)in the 
&gt; restoration of my '77 Westy have the following warning printed on them 
&gt; &quot;WARNING: This product contains chemicals known to the State of California to 
&gt; cause cancer and birth defects or other reproductive harm&quot;. Well, I'm in 
&gt; Virginia, so does this mean they are safe to use?     Jeff S.  

California passed an initiative a few years back called proposition 65.
The idea was to put warning labels on products that contained carcinogenic
or birth-defect causing chemicals.  The list of chemicals is quite long!
Like most initiatives, it was rather poorly worded, so most companies get
comply by putting the warning you have noted on every product they
make.  Businesses comply by posting the warning at the entrance door.  We
see that warning so often that it has become invisible.  There are even
restaurants that post the warning, just in case!

If you drive a bus, you are already exposing yourself to dangers far
greater than that posed by the paint you're putting on your bus!  Your
distance from the Golden State affords you good protection from our tort
lawyers!  :)
