 From a philosophical standpoint, I would like to know why most people get 
rid of their dual PDSIT carbs on the 72-74 bus in exchange for other 
setups...i.e. dual webers, single progressive, etc.

I currently am running dual weber 34 ICT's on my 74 SC, and although they 
seem to perform adequately, they are extremely difficult to adjust because 
(1) I do not have an engine compartment top hatch in the SC, (2) the 
hexagonal linkage, although seemingly infinitely adjustable, is unforgiving 
when you're trying to disconnect it, and (3) the webers are placed 
extremely low in the engine bay...(very short intake manifolds) which makes 
it tough to get to some of the adjustment screws.

I recall that my dual PDSITs on my 73 and 74 bus (in a previous life) were 
easier to adjust because of the location of the adjustment screws.  I also 
recall that on the 73, I switched to a single weber progressive that 
I  HATED because it kept loading up.  However, I can't remember why I 
switched from the dual PDSIT's!  That was 25 years ago...

I think I would like to go back to dual PDSIT's...does anyone have any 
thoughts on this?  Thanks, Greg
