Subject: 1600 into 72 problem

I put a 1600 bug motor in my 72 bus.It bolted up ok and I can see that I have some tin work ahead,but I came up with something that I did not expect.The clutch is right to the floor.I had to turn the clutch ajustment all the way to the front and I still have 2 inches of play then the rest of the petal is very hard.I should add that the bus did not have the stock motor in it when I bought it.It had a 1600 1970 bus motor.If I need to buy a new clutch and pressure plate do I match the parts to the 72 trany or the aftermarket motor.Thanks for any help you can send my way.Tim Linke
