&gt;Hello all. Does anyone out there have a fix for rattles in the jalousie
&gt;windows? Mine make quite a bit of racket when traveling. I was thinking about

&gt;them from making so much noise, but an worried that they might not seal
&gt;correctly. Anybody else with this problem, or a cure for it?

Mine rattle even with the windows cranked securely closed.  Turned out it
was the screens rattling, not the window itself.  Have you checked this?  I
think I'm gonna put some kind of rubber insulators around the screens to
prevent this, or maybe just jam something else in there to hold them tight.
