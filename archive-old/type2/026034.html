Subject: Looking for a bus accessory

When I traveled the country in my bus a few years ago I had a bicycle with
me.  I found the Specialized Rock Hopper to be the perfect bike to be used
as a dingy for short jaunts away from the Mothership, which by the way is
still running great, although I don't drive her as much as I used to.

Well...I am looking for another bike.  I am a big man, 6.4/275 lbs. give or
take an ounce so I need a bike for a tall man.  I would prefer a fat tire
model in good shape.

I inquired about the one posted recently but no go on that one.

If anyone has a decent bike FS please let me know.  I kind of like having
one around when I go camping in my bus.

Thanks,

Charlie
