Subject: my bus stalls when braking, too. input?

i have the same problem. a relative of mine (used to own a vw shop, still 
works on them) said it was the timing and supposedly fixed it but it's still 
giving me problems. i'd like to know what this is, too. i don't have much 
money and am wondering if i can fix this myself.

&gt;Subject: [T2] Stalls when braking
&gt;
&gt;I'm having the following problem with my 71 Westy, it stalls when I brake 
&gt;at
&gt;a stop light or when I downshift to slow down. Other than that, the bus is
&gt;running better than ever. Could it be a vacuum leak? Any help will be
&gt;appreciated. Best regards,
&gt;
&gt;Victor
