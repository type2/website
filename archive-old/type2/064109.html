Subject: Odd Roof Rack

Picked up a Beetle roof rack at a local antique store today.  It is 
different from any that I have seen.  Similar in style to the steel ZVW 
type, but has thick wood slats and sits in large rubber suction cups that 
have &quot;P.Mays.Koln&quot; (with a umlaut?, 2 dots over the 'o') and has 
turnbuckles to attach to the rain gutter.  It has 6 slats (1 inch wide) 
which are 5 inches apart and are rivited to the frame.  It also has 
horizontal metal tubes (2) running the width (under the wood slats).

Anyone recognize this?  Care to appraise it?  The sale tag said that it 
would fit &quot;Beetles from '67 to whenever they quit making Beetles&quot;. ;-)
