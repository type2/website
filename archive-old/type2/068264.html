&gt; &gt; I just installed (2) Lobro brand boot kits and (2) Meisterstatz boot 
&gt; &gt; kits.  Interesting differences between kits.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt;  Hmmm.  Meisterstatz.  Isn't that Joel?

An' we all thought he just played with the computer, go figger.

He's out back pouring rubber, hammering metal, baggin' up bolts, and 
slapping them into a box to suck out our hard earned mullah!

Tho at $16 bucks a pop, I don't think he's getting very rich.
