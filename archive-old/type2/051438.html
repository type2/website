&gt; Eventually I am gong to have to do something with the engine in my
74
&gt; Westy.
&gt; I need to determine the cost difference between trying
&gt; to rebuild one myself, or buying a good rebuild longblock from one
of the
&gt; vendors.
&gt; Can anyone give me a ball park figure on what I could expect to
spend if
&gt; I were to attempt to rebuild it on my own?

If you do things properly in a DYI rebuild, you're *not* going to save
any money vs. buying a longblock from a reputable vendor.  So, rebuild
your own engine if you want the &quot;experience&quot;, rebuild your own engine
if you want a *better* rebuild than a most purchased longblocks (i.e.,
you're going to balance rods and pistons, equalize deck heights, etc.)
but don't rebuild it because you think you're going to do it cheaper.
