&gt;&gt; Boy, I like this idea, having considered redoing my camper interior
&gt;&gt; custom, then I saw the price, then I did the multiplication, choke!
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Seems kinda steep for plyboard. I'd be happy even up to a grand, but
&gt;&gt; you're looking at 2,242.50 for the upper end job before shipping it
&gt;&gt; across country. I don't have that furniture value in my living room.
&gt;
&gt;Billy,
&gt;
&gt;Trot on down to Home Depot and price the flat-pack &quot;Mills Pride&quot; kitchen
&gt;cabinets, then over to a furninture store and try to fill your
&gt;house/apartment with furniture similar to what you have now.
&gt;
&gt;Particle board and laminate may be cheap, but case work is *expensive*!
&gt;If you had the choice in the 1970s, the optional Westy package would have
&gt;set you back about what this package will cost you.  I am amazed that they
&gt;kept the cost down as low as they have.
&gt;
&gt;I am looking at and lusting after the latest Westfalia package  (the
&gt;&quot;James Cook&quot;) and figure that it probably will add at least $25,000 to the
&gt;base price of the shell. Compared to $25,000, $2,500 soulds very nice :-)

I saw this thread and before I looked and thought about it I was sort of of
the notion $2500 for a camper kit to put in a friggin bay window!!!!!!!
But now
I sort of agree oddly enough on this one with Steve, although a good DIYer
could certainly make a similar interior for probably $1000 in parts even with
the sink, stove, etc, you got to figure your time into the matter a bit.  And
that kit looks pretty darn slick, as nice as a Vanagon in the pics but it
will be interesting to see what the quality of execution is really like.
Would
I pop $2500 for a kit to put in a bus, probably not I'd just go find a real
Westy
interior, but that can take some time, and in the end may not be as
functional.  His point is fair as well on original cost, I think I recall some
pricing in '76 that even the hardtop interior added about $1250-$1500 to the
price of a new bus, and that is what $5000 in todays dollars.  Not for
everyone certainly but pretty neat.
