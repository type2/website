Subject: Nose emblem question

Hello all,

I have a 78 Sagegreen westy to be painted next week.  It been at the 
body/paint shop since June. However there was some damage to the nose that 
has since been pulled, filled, sanded, ect. Turned out great but my body 
shop guy (who has been amazing) recommended that I not put the spare tire on 
the front and we welded the mounting holes closed. I'm bummed cause I liked 
to put the bike rack on the tire for some trips. Dosen't really matter 
though as I'll just keep the tire in the cabinet.

However, I want to put a VW emblem on the front but don't know what style 
was ever stock on a 78 Sagegreen Westy. My 79 Sagegreen westy had a very 
weathered white one. Was this used in 78? If so where can I get one?

Or was a chrome one ever used on sagegreen westies? Anyways I'd like to 
figure it out soon because It just dawned on me that if holes need to be 
drilled it might be best done prior to painting for rust prevention. Just 
trying be come close to what was original. Thanks in advance.
