Bill:
You are correct- 79 and later CA originals were all electronic ignition.
Sorta the same subject as Karl was getting at yesterday: Books are often wrong!

(I was a parts man at a FLAPS in the 70's and there were many errors in them
then, I imagine thay have only gotten worse!) No substitute for experience!
You don't have to take out the distributor to determine whether it has points.
If it has points, there is a single wire (usually green) coming from the
distributor and going to the coil. It's also prettty easy to pop off the cap
and rotor and see what's there. Not much chance of making it worse!

&gt; 1) why do they show points/condenser in tuneup kits in catalogues for later
&gt; buses, especially california buses, didn't these come equiped with
&gt; electronic ignition? I don't have the nerve to take out my distributor yet!
