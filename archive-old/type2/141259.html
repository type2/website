Subject: MPG

Hello listies, Forgive me if this is in the archive, but I cant &quot;surf&quot; while
at work:(

I just came back from a campout and and didnt have good luck with my
motor( bad oil leak, looks like crack in the case!) but that another story.
I am running on a loaner motor and I was very impressed with the MPG, its a
DP 1600 with a 34pict and what I am figuring is that I was getting about
21-22mpg I have never seen anything close with my onle 1600 with a single
weber. So is 21-22 mpg the average MPG for running 60mph with a  a loaded
down riviera camper(loaded is: wife 2 kids 2  large dogs westy tent all the
camping gear and the old motor in back too)?????

thanks
Ian in norfolk
