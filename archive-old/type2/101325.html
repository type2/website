That is why Spies Hecker makes an excellent primer that is the best
non-zinc rust prevention I have seen and at the same time acts as an
isolator between old paint and their top-coats. The stuff is called
Priomat (most Germans just know it by Spies Hecker red-brown ...). It's
a bit pricy but good.

And it comes in rattlecans for small jobs, too. I actually saw the
rattlecans at my paint shop for the first time and the owner confessed
that they use them whenever they have blank metal or unknown old paint
to deal with - he said that there is nothing better out there.

&gt; Speis Hecker is excellent paint--BUT--be sure to over reduce it a
bit--

&gt; Otherwise it has a tendancy to bubble all over---don't ask why--it's
&gt; just the nature of the beast.
