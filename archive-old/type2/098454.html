Subject: For Sale! gas tank and fuel pump!!! 

Hello List,

I guess this should be a Friday post. I was in need of
a good set of 72-74 style heat exchangers but was
concerned about the cost. I went searching on Ebarf
and found a pair of good used origional German heater
boxes. I had seen a set just like them go for $125 but
I won these for $50.50! With shipping it came out to
$65.50! For some, that price may be high but I was
quite pleased.

On a different note, today I have been preping 2 gas
tanks which I am going to seal with the POR15 gas tank
kit. The one that I am keeping is a FI tank but the
other is for sale. It came form a 74 bus It had almost
NO rust to start with but I have enough sealer to do
the inside of both tanks. Since preping it, it only
has a couple of very small surface rust spots.
Tomorrow, I hope to go ahead and pour the sealer in
both tanks so They sould be ready to install by the
weekend. ANy way, the 74 tank is in excellent
condition. It comes with its in tank screen which is
in good condition. IT does not come with a working
fuel guage sender, only the plate from one to cover up
the hole. I will sand down the outside of the tank and
give it a coat of POR15 senigloss black so hopefully
it will last another 28 years. This tank will be like
new and ready to insatll with your fuel gauge sender
and seal. If you buy one from Busted bus, they want
$125. Then you have to pay shipping and even then you
may still have to seal it or buy a new filter for it.
I will sell this one for less than half that price. I
want $65.00 plus shipping for this like new condition
tank.That just does cover my costs. Let me know if you
are interested! I also have a good mechanical fuel
pump and its push rod. I want $15.00 + sh. for that.

Thanks for reading my unexcusably long post. Have a
great day!
