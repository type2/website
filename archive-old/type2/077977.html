Subject: Heating Question

Got a chance go through the heating system on my '72 today and got
everything sealed up tight and ready for the cold New Hampshire winter.  I
noticed that the amount of flow to the cab section is significantly less
than the flow to the vents under the rear seat.  All paths to the front are
tight and solid, but there is still a huge difference in temperature and
airflow.  The controls on the rear vents do not completely stop the heat
flow regardless of adjustment, and this heat is basically being wasted, as
it is just trapped under the seat box.  I am thinking of sealing these rear
vents completely with a metal cap and a bit of epoxy putty (permanent, but
not undoable).  Before I do this, I wanted to check to be sure that this
would in fact send all the air to the front passenger compartment, and not
just trap it in limbo somewhere.  Anybody ever done this before, is it worth
the effort?  I definitely need some list wisdom on this one....
