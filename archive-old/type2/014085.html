Subject: Identifying Rebuilder

I've has some inquiries about an 82 air cooled 4 speed manual
transmission I've been trying to sell. 
The transmission is painted gloss black, all of the short bolts are new
cad plated and the long bolts on the shifter plate have just got silver
painted nuts. 
I can't find a re builders tag or any other way to identify the re
builder but I figured each re builder might have their own particular
finishing touches that might identify where it came from. I am assuming
that they log the transmission numbers that they rebuild.
If anybody has any clues I'd appreciate hearing them.
I drove around with the tranny in the Vanagon for about two weeks before
I finally striped her down for parts. I'd rather do this little bit of
research than discount the tranny down to nothing. I know that this is
not a buyer beware tranny.
