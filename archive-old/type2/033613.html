&gt; 1. should it run with the key in ACC

See question 2 first.  The original FI pump had a logic circuit (the
double relay) to shut the pump down when the engine was not running,
unless the ignition switch was in the &quot;statr&quot; position.  It isn't very
safe to have the pump running whenever there is power to the coil, but it
is the easiest way to wire it up.  If you ever have an accident where the
fuel system is opened or if you pop a gas line, that pump will keep
pumping 'til the key is turned off.

What would I do?  I would try to rig a logic that would power the pump
when (a) the ignition was on and (b) the gen light was off.  Carbs have
enough of a resevoir of gas that not having the pump running when you are
starting is not going to keep the car from starting (unless it has been
sitting for *years*).  The only drawback that I can think of is that if
the alternator dies, the engine will die shortly thereafter.

&gt; 2. is this original equipment? 
&gt; (cant find it in my manual but then again I never heard of a CLYMER shop 
&gt; manual)

NO!  The '76 buses with 2L engines sold in the US all came with fuel
injection.  Totally different system.  Everything between and including
the air filter to the intake manifold on your bus has been replaced with
non-stock parts.  The FI fuel pump produces 35psi of pressure, carbs need
5psi.  Also, your block has no place to mount a fuel pump, so the facet
aftermarket pump was the only option available to the DPO who did the carb
conversion.

&gt; 3.and the $64 question do I need it?

Yes.  The fuel pump keeps the carb supplied with gas.  No pump, no gas.

&gt; P.S. I almost have the &quot;financial director&quot; convinced I need a Haynes manual

Alas, this won't be much help :-(  the manuals will all tell you that you
have FI and how to maintain it.  If you can only buy one, I recommend
Bentley, but that's pretty much a &quot;religious question&quot; :-)  Anything is
better than nothing.
