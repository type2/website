&gt;Also, it has a webber prog carb. Did the '74 1.8l come standard with dual

Dual carbs, unless it was an automatic in which case they were supposed to have come with (or been available with?) FI.  I have never seen one of them though.

&gt;My right-side head has the ports for the EGR (I assume that's
&gt;what they are) - which have come unplugged and I still haven't managed to
&gt;plug them correctly.

The archives has lots of info on this.
