Subject: Deep cycle batteries (where to mount?)

I'm putting a much-needed auxillary deep cycle battery in my van, and the
guy at the RV place said I should be careful about putting one in the cab
as these (and all acid batteries) produce toxic and potentially flammable
gas.  Yikes.  Unfortunately, the little battery cavity under the driver's
seat in my '80 vanagon is too shallow for the marine battery (it's only 7&quot;
deep), and so my current plan is to go with a gel-cell deep cycle battery
mounted in the compartment under the couch.  These gel-cells are supposed
be more forgiving in the toxic gas department.

Has anyone heard of any deep cycle batteries that will fit in the battery
cavity, i.e., that are less than 7.25&quot; high? Has anyone found any other
solutions for this?


Thanks.
