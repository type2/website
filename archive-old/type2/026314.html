Subject: FI diagnosis idea??
Message-ID: &lt;C51ED84B6F47D211917A0000F8BCBD11015500EF_at_zcard00g_dot_ca.nortel_dot_com&gt;

This may be really half baked, but: 
One way of characterizing the working or not of a FI system
is the width, frequency, and voltage of the injector pulses. 
Does this sound like a dwell meter to you? Doesn't the dwell meter measure 
the duty cycle of the ignition pulses.
Is there anything that could be learned from using a tach/dwell meter 
hooked across the injector plug. Obviously the existing scales would 
not be useful, if one measured the readings from a good,
system, and one with various problems: Temp sensors, 
bad grounds, ballast resistors etc
would it be possible to diagnose a system using this.
Maybe tests with, and without the injector hooked up would tell something
about
injector health and/or balast resistor/ground health?
As I said, this is at best half baked, and will leave figuring 
out if further baking is useful to more knowledgible minds.
