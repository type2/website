Just want to thank you for all the solid information you have provided me in 
my VW Type2 explorations.  Also the rest of you that have contributed through 
the years...your contributions have made the difference between a job well 
done and being &quot;stuck&quot; wondering if I really should pay that mechanic $50/hr. 
Especially seeings how we out here in the pacific don't have nearly the 
resources mainlanders have.
Truely Appreciated...
