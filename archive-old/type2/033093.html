Subject: Imput Shaft

Thanks to all that replied on the engine number question, I have written
some and told how after I got every thing hooked up, a new weber 32/36, 009,
and blue coil that it fired up and came to life, with the exception that it
threw a rod, BUMMER. Any how I am now faced with the option of installing a
upright until I can get another pan cake.
I have read that you need to shorten your imput shaft by a 1/2 inch, is this
true, and why. Also can you install another pan cake engine back in after
you have done this? Any other advice someone can give me on this swap is
appreciated. I keep post from where I mentioned it before but no one
actually spoke of what was involved.
Thanks You!
