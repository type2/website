Subject: Re: [T2] tires

Maybe you should lower the bus even more, so that the rubber
eventually melts because of rubbing the cabin. Eventually the rubber
will go away, you'll drive on the rims and everything will be great,
like VW engineers had designed.
regards - Arnaud

&gt; I had my bus lower. The tires I have on it now are 205-65-15. The front tires
&gt; rub. They rub really bad when there is someone riding in the middle seat.
