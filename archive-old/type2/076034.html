Subject: Couple heading to mexico in VW bus

Hello all

last year I met a couple who had just bought a VW bus and were planning
on moving to Mexico from here in Canada and taking the bus for the trip.
They were heading there sometime this past summer. Their names were Dan
and Nisha. I told them about this list and told them many listees may
offer to host them on their way.
I was just wondering if anyone had come across them on their journey.
I haven't heard from them to know if they made it OK.
