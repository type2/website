Subject: Fw: [T2] HELP ME !!!

Michelle- ( Your P-mail is bouncing tonite ):
You have been had, plain and simple.
Where is the hole in the case ?
The test for pressure in an engine case
is the oil pressure in the bearing circuit.
Any other defect is a leak not under pressure.
No reputable engine builder will assemble
an engine with case cracks. Holes ? No.
Please describe the hole and location.

&gt;   I am not in the best of spirits right now since my Bus is sitting in my
&gt;back yard DEAD....I have a question that I want as many people to answer or
&gt;just give me some thoughts on my situation. I had my 1800cc engine rebuilt
&gt;last Fall I took the engine out brought the engine to this guy (who will
&gt;remain nameless) He is a very reputable VW Mechanic.
