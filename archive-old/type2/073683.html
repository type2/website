Subject: Re: [T2] FRI: Another Terminology Rant - Horsepower

Good point, reminds me of the folks that have the the slow CPUs with 
high megahertz ratings. Know anybody like that? =^)

However squirrels are mighty strong for their size, and most especially 
they are fast climbers--it just isn't right, it don't fit, Joe!

I suggest for a rating standard the pulling power of some sort of 
gastropod, probably something like a slug, as they are weak and 
horizontally opposed, and behind them they leave a shiny slick.

&gt; Joe Clarks' concerns over terminology, coupled with Jeremy's concern 
&gt; over
&gt; power, have brought to mind another badly chosen term that perhaps we 
&gt; should
&gt; consider changing. Yes, I do mean &quot;horsepower.&quot; While I know the rest 
&gt; of the
&gt; world uses the term &quot;horsepower&quot; in describing their vehicles, our 
&gt; cars, as
&gt; has been noted, are not really cars; they're Volkswagens, so we can be
&gt; different...as further evidenced by my lust for an early &quot;ragtop&quot; 
&gt; bus--sorry
&gt; Joe, no offense meant.
&gt;
&gt; I got so tired of big-muscled dudes bragging about their 450 horses 
&gt; under
&gt; the hood that I had to quit hanging out with big muscled dudes. Now, as 
&gt; I'm
&gt; again thinking of moving (using my bus, of course), I'm realizing that I
&gt; wish I were friends with more big-muscled dudes.
&gt;
&gt; Imagine how impressed they'd be if I told them my bus' power rating was 
&gt; more
&gt; like 60,000 compared to their measly 450. Of course, we might use a
&gt; different unit, but I don't have to tell them that, and as long as 
&gt; nobody
&gt; takes away their steroids, they might not notice that I'm talking about
&gt; squirrel power. Yes, squirrel power; that's what I said--SP!
&gt;
&gt; There are many advantages to using squirrels as the power rating for 
&gt; buses.
&gt; Think of it. We could refine our power ratings to a more specific 
&gt; number,
&gt; such as 61,229. Also, your RPM could go up dramatically, since you can 
&gt; put a
&gt; squirrel in a cage with a wheel. The squirrel can turn the wheel 
&gt; waaaaaaaay
&gt; faster than the horse can run around that little horsey ring thing 
&gt; inside
&gt; the fence. So, with SP as our rating we could probably like quadruple 
&gt; the
&gt; RPMs, even with a sick squirrel.
&gt;
&gt; Got a 40-horse bus with a hole in the roof that you want to sell on 
&gt; eBay? No
&gt; problem. It takes about 1000 squirrels to carry a chase a horse across a
&gt; field, so what you're really talking about is a 40,000 squirrel-power
&gt; ragtop, dude!
&gt;
&gt; Yeah, so we're different. That's not news to horses OR squirrels.
&gt;
&gt; Thanks!
&gt;
&gt; Joe
