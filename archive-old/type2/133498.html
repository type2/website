&gt; I don't believe these are critical for cooling. The cooling tins go above
&gt; the pushrod tubes.

right, those two little pieces of tin are pretty important.

&gt; The tins between the case and heater box are only stone
&gt; guards to prevent damage to the pushrod tubes.

I have J tubes on mine and those tins have been long gone with no apparent
effect on cooling (I have guages)
