&gt; &gt; Judging by this comment :) there might be some opinions around here
&gt; &gt; concerning Gex. I would love to hear about them. This is the first time I
&gt; &gt; have seen them mentioned on the list.
&gt; Hi john,
&gt;
&gt; That is because gex has been discussed over and over and over and over ad
&gt; nauseum

I have been reading the list for about 3 months and haven't seen one word about
Gex. Sorry to have bothered anyone.

Thanks

John
