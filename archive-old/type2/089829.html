Subject: Re: [T2] Feedback Request on MoFoCo Type IV Engines

[...]
looks like the mofoco is the best shot for you.  I was unable to locate 
anything in duluth.  No return messages from the AIRS members.  For a 
personal reason the mofoco link will be dropped from my links site.  I 
dont do business with companies that put their catalogs in Windoze only 
formats.

&gt; I posted the other day needing a reliable engine for my '77 Westphalia 
&gt; with a blown cylinder.  Mofoco is in Milwaukee, about 5 hours from me, 
&gt; and sell rebuilt  Type IV engines for about 1600$.  I could drive there 
&gt; and pick the thing up and save some $$$/hassles re:shipping.  But I 
&gt; don't want to buy a &quot;pig in a poke&quot;.  Has anyone tried their engines?  
&gt; I did try Jake Raby as per several suggestions but I don't think my van 
&gt; is worth the $3500 he needs as starters for an engine...I think if the 
&gt; kids and I had a breakdown out a thousand miles we'd junk the van and 
&gt; take a bus home, or limp back if we could.
&gt; Good price on longblocks from Bus Depot.  Any reactions based on 
&gt; experience regarding their engines?
&gt; Cordially,
