Subject: Re: EZouts.... Help(??) stripped screws

Gentlepersons-
                       Does anyone remember/know the name of the device that 
replaces the
chuck on an electric drill with a sliding rod in a centering frame- In effect 
converting
the pistol drill into a small portable drill press. I have one on one of my 
drills, and I think
the manufacturer is General...but the drill is borrowed away at the moment, 
so I can't
check. This device, even on a Stanley, or Craftsman cheepee drill is the best 
way to a-
void the usual broken bits or EZ-Out's when removing broken studs or stripped 
bolts and screws. The device keeps the bit centered and prevents wandering 
and bending- The usual cause of broken bits in the already broken 
stud/bolt...Someone out there must have one to relay the name to the list...
