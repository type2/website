Subject: Spray Guns was DIY Bus Painting

Currently looking at a Sharpe FX 300 HVLP gun for about 100. www.spraygundepot_dot_com. Seems like an okay gun that I can get different nozzles for for different weight paints. Tell me more about the ca paint shops with the sata knock offs... Im in Annapolis, MD.
