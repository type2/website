&lt;&lt; Paul,

LOL! I suspect that *everyone* on this list has probably switched
wires to the wrong place at some point...that's why someone said *check 
it*.

Keep learning!


Cheers, dave &gt;&gt;

A few years back I bought a Bug off the street that had a &quot;For Sale
As Is&quot; sign on it...Flash paint job over rust and bondo...Nice mags on
adaptors...Extractor exhaust...
I asked the guy what he wanted...$100...It's not running and hasta
move from side to on his street and he was tired of pushing it back
and forth...
I popped the engine lid...New Brazilian carb...New 009 with a clear
cap...I told him I could probably get it running but he said he just
wasn't interested any more and wanted the $100...I gave it to him,
rearranged the plug wires, started it up (rough but running) and asked
him to follow me home and I'd give him a ride back...
