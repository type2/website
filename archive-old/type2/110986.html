&gt; &gt; The problem wit running 60 mph during the day is, you can actually see
&gt; &gt; passing motorists flipping you off---I'd rather not know--:&gt;)

&gt; Interesting. I prefer to travel on the state highways--regardless of what
&gt; vehicle I'm driving--for esthetic reasons. That being said, I find myself on
&gt; the interstates more often than I'd like. From western Kentucky I go north
&gt; to Michigan, south into Tennessee, and further on occasion. I cruise my 74
&gt; at a steady 60 mph and I haven't had much trouble on the interstates. I do
&gt; try to be as considerate as possible by staying in the slow lane, making it
&gt; as easy as I can for other drivers to get around me. I don't recall ever
&gt; being flipped off (except maybe during rush hour) or cursed at on the
&gt; interstate. Even at 3 am in Ohio on I-75 while surrounded by trucks.

Me too.  I can't recall any instance of being &quot;flipped off&quot; on an
interstate.  Now, my ususal interstate exposure is I-5 in the central
valley, I-10, I-15, and I-40.  None of these are noted for being slow.
I've been all over the western US in my bus and sometimes interstates are
hard to avoid, but I've never had any problems on them.  They're just
boooorrrriiinggggg.

Perhaps folks on the other coast are just naturally more hostile?  :)

The typical bus has about the same power-to-weight ratio as a semitruck,
and maintains similar speeds.  I stick with the right lane and keep out of
other folk's way.  There's always a left lane if they want to pass.
