Subject: Buses over the Rainbow - NE Iowa Edition

Volks,

FINAL CALL!      Friday, September 17-Sunday, September 19, 2004

This is the 3rd gathering of VW friends from the upper Midwest.  Our 
first campout was a rainy one that ended in a beautiful double rainbow, 
hence the name.  This edition of the gathering will be held at Pulpit 
Rock Campground in Decorah, Iowa (far northeastern corner of Iowa).  
We'll gather Friday evening for the weekend with chat around the 
firepit.  Saturday will include a craft show at the campgrounds, door 
prizes, a short local tour of the scenic highlights and a longer 
afternoon tour to the Mississippi River where we'll tour the Effigy 
Mounds National Monument and view the fall colors from Pikes Peak (also 
discovered by Zebulon Pike and with a view of 4 states on a clear 
day!).  The campgrounds is a pretty location with a trout stream 
running through it and immediately adjacent to the scenic Upper Iowa 
River.  It is located on the edge of Decorah and includes a lighted 
bike/walking trail to the city.  Canoeing, fishing, tubing, biking, 
antiquing are all popular &quot;sports&quot; :-) in Decorah.  B&amp;Bs are available 
for those unwilling to camp.  Cost is $12 for non-electric and $14 for 
electric.  Event organizer is Jim Fritz at jfritz_at_alpinecom_dot_net    
Reservations are necessary as the campgrounds will be full that 
weekend.  We're currently at about 17 attendees/vans attending from as 
far away as Winnipeg, South Carolina, Illinois, Missouri, Iowa, and 
Minnesota.  We hope you can attend!
