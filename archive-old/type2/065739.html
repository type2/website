Subject: Re: Fuel injection and front oil seal 2.0L

&gt;Hey folks,
&gt;
&gt;I hate to be bothering everybody with a repeat question, but I didnt get even
&gt;one response back on these questions.  I KNOW there's someone out there who
&gt;can help me, PLEASE, PLEASE PLEEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE.

&gt;I am in the process of redoing the fuel system on a 2.0 FI engine.  Maybe you
&gt;all can answer some qestions, please.
&gt;
&gt;1.  How do I clean my fuel injectors?  Do I soak them, wipe them down, or
&gt;just leave them alone?  if I soak them, in what?  There pretty grungy on the
&gt;outside, but do they even need cleaning?  
&gt;
&gt;2.Anyone know what material the intake manifolds are made of?  Can I repaint
&gt;them? after cleaning them, a lot of paint came off.  Some of the metal looks
&gt;tarnished like brass, some looks like steel (where thepaint is freshly
&gt;removed, right next to the brass area) and other areas look rusted.  These
&gt;areas are all on the same metal tube, so it is the same metal (duh).  I
&gt;sealed the inside of the gas tank with some POR-15 gas tank sealer.  Do I use
&gt;this same stuff on the inside of the tubes?  Do I just clean up the outsides
&gt;and repaint? Do I leave it alone?  Also, these tubes (and the air sensor box
&gt;thingy area) had a light film of oil or some such in them.  Is this
&gt;indicative of anything?
&gt;
&gt;3.Do the injectors need to go back in the same cylinders?Do I need to replace
&gt;the little rubber gaskets?  Where can I find these?
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;4. Can I reuse the gaskets on the intake manifolds at the head?  If so, do I
&gt;put some permatex on them?  If not, where can I find just those gaskets?
&gt;
&gt;Oil seal questions...
&gt;
&gt;I've heard (and read) a lot about how to put the oil seal back in, but have
&gt;not seen anywhere about how to get the old one out.  Does anyone have any
&gt;suggestions? 
&gt;I dont want to do any damage. 
&gt;
&gt;When I'm replacing the seal after removing the old one, Do I use any sealer
&gt;when 
&gt;I put it back in? (I'm using a press to put it back in)
&gt;
&gt;Thanks for all your help.

   Nag, Nag, Nag.  You as bad as my last ole lady! :-)
  
 Alright, you have the hoses off the injectors? 
 Altho I can't give a good logical reason for putting them back in exact
same spot, there is a certain amount of Voodoo involved so try to. Get new
hoses too and clamps. 

 We are talking electronic solenoid in there so I would spray them 
with carb cleaner and dry. Maybe you could soak but I'm not inclined.
 
 Before re-installing hook the leads and hose back up and observe spray
pattern into a can. If they look good and the same then
re-install. There is also an injector cleaner that you put in your
gas. I think it's just acetone but don't quote me.

 Do not re-use any gaskets or o-rings, get them at local vw store. 
You don't have one then get one. 

 By the way do you have the Bentley Manual for that year? Get one.
Has a pretty fair section on fuel injection.

 Intake manifold: may very well be a machined steel flange brazed to 
a steel tube etc. I would try to remove internal rust as well as 
possible but not with POR-15. Take them down and pound the hell out of
them. Then if you like plug one end and pour something like metal-
prep in and slosh and soak. Then rinse out with water and dry. 
 Out side: paint with some flat paint of your choice. Get it bead 
blasted if you like. Do not polish as it needs to soak up heat.
 Film of oil inside of intake is fine also if not rusty.

 Air Chingadero: go ahead and spray it clean with carb cleaner etc.
Once again take care to keep electronics dry.

 Oil seal: you don't say which one so I forget. Generally I use a 
chingaso like a right angle flat head screw driver to remove.
 Your local parts store should be able to help. 

 It is more important how you re-install. 
 Use a tube etc. the same dia as outside of seal to press in.
You may use a little permatex on outside of seal if you like but it 
should be something that doesn't keep you from getting it out next 
time.

  While you are doing this alternate between the following 2 Mantras:

 &quot;Rust never sleeps and new shit don't wear out&quot; 
 &quot;I hope this works&quot;
