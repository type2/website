Importance: Normal

Everyone deserves a big pat on the back. As of 06-19-01 we have $1228.90 in
collected funds, $120.00 in un-collected funds for a total of $1348.90. We
have issued a cashier's check for $961.00 to pay for the new HW the list
needs which has already been deducted from the present balance. Thanks to
everyone for their contributions to keep the list going.

Contributions (for procrastinators like myself) may be sent to:
