I want to thank Bob, Steve, Karl, Chris, Stephen, Brian, Joe, Mark and all
who responded to my S.O.S. today. The no-idle,no-power, no-go problem was
fixed in ten seconds after reading your replies. The 90 degree elbow and
hose was off the aux air regulator and once reconnected, off we went for the
first drive in ELEVEN MONTHS. My wife and kids thank you as well. Tonight
will be the best nights sleep we have had in a long time. I love learning
&gt;from you guys!
    Joe, good luck with that bus and thank you for the morale booster. You
too will one day drive it, but I sympathaze with your tribulations!
 Finally I can say...See ya on the road!
WEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!!!!!
Jay
77 Westy that I love again!
