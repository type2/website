I'm considering running hydraulic lifters on a solid-lifter cam in my '77 2.0 liter engine. This has much to do with home economics--my home, that is. I have found a solid-lifter NOS VW camshaft for about $65 w/shipping (one-time deal). Nothing this side of reground came close (I think I was looking at $170 for a hydraulic cam w/gear). I've recently heard and read that reground cams have been wearing at totally unacceptable rates and I'd rather be fishing than rebuilding this engine again.

I'm going to have to replace my lifters and I can go stock, winding up with solid lifters from here. OR, I can put another $149.97 + tax into the equation and wind up with hydraulic lifters, hydraulic pushrods, and hydraulic intake/exhaust springs.

Rumor is that an unnamed listee whose initials are Dave Schwarze has been running hydraulic lifters on a solid cam for over 2 years. I won't name my source for this info, but Ken Hooper swears he hasn't seen convincing evidence that there's a problem with doing this, other than possibly some small performance hit.

I'm looking for informed opinions that are backed up with sound theory or actual evidence for or against mixing hydraulic lifters and solid-lifter cams.

I ain't skeered of adjusting valves. I sometimes adjust valves in my sleep. I just like the idea of having valves that are *always* adjusted, even if I sacrifice the rhythmic warning of impending doom that comes with each stretching valve-stem as it dances to the devil's music and kisses the valve-stem full-on. My thought is that I might actually get longer life and better service by having continuously adjusted valves.

If you feel like opining privately, that's cool. If you got informed wisdom, I imagine others will appreciate it; there's a good $132 difference between camshafts of varying ilks, grinds, and colors...and that's before you get into performance parts.

Thanks a bunch! Joe
