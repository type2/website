the only way I would do this without removing the engine would be with a
dual wand system, one blowing in steam and water/cleaner AND some sort of
suction device to suck out what is loose in the tank, I would use the
largest diameter hose I could get into the tank.  

for presure try the high presure drain opener for kitchen sinks, about $15
at home depot.

for suck you could use a POWERFULL wet dry vac (NOT WITH GAS, non flamable
materiel only it could explode)

take hoses off bottom of tank, insert both hoses, turn on the water full
blast and after a few minutes start sucking the debris.  I would keep it
up for at least 1/2 hour....personally I would probably still pull the
engine myself, the 71 is one of the easiest engines to pull...so bite the
bullet
