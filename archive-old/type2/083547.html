Subject: Re: [T2] unsafe tires?

&gt;&gt;- I believe the front tires are perfect for the bus.&lt;&lt;
you are correct. 185r14 is the correct size.  if you have a full
Westy then i would recommend D load range instead of C.

&gt;&gt;- The rear tires seem underrated and I do get a lot of highway buffeting.
What should I do?&lt;&lt;
replace them to match the front tires.

&gt;&gt;- The spares are &quot;new&quot; but are they too old to risk putting on in the snow?&lt;&lt;
unknown. but why would you need snow tires in Texas? ;-)
but seriously, if they are anywhere near as old as you think they might be,
get rid of them.

good luck,
