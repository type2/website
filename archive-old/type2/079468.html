Subject: transmission problems???

gang,

matty here. i am having a problem with my 76 westy. it
is grossly lacking in power. this thing is a dog, even
for a bus. the thing is when i shift gears i can hear
the engine race when i hit the throttle but i dont
notice the transfer in my speed. the engine races as i
hit the gas but the vehicle dsoent speed up much. it
seems that transmission is not doing its job. i have
also considered bad compression. but i really dont
know. anyone have any experience with this type of
thing. thanks- matty
