Subject: New Side Tents &amp; Carver Propane Furnace

I just received a shipment of new German side tents.  I now have the Nizza II 
in stock and ready to ship.  I also have a new tent called the Andria that is 
a low priced alternative.  Give me a few days to get this one up on my 
website.

I also have 2 Carver propane furnaces in stock.  I will not be reordering 
these again until late summer.

Pmail me for special listmember pricing.
