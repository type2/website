Just because no one responds to your query does not mean folks don't know
the answer.  No one is obliged to answer anyone's questions here...some are
less likely to respond when an owner modification disables necessary factory
engineering, myself included.  You assume a bit much here. I will say that
if I were *forced* to disable the stock exchanger system, *which would never
happen*, I would fabricate the appropriate shroud to give the t-stat an
environment as close to the original design as possible.
