&gt; A couple of weeks ago I posted a message asking for recommendations
on new
&gt; tires for a '71 Westy.  Well, after shopping around at various tire
stores
&gt; in the Seattle area, I found that Les Schwab had the best deal on a
light
&gt; truck, all season, all terrain C load rated (1700 lbs. max for each
tire)
&gt; tire in a size 185R14.  In fact, it was the only light truck, all
season,
&gt; all terrain C load rated tire in a size 185R14.  All other 185R14
tires that
&gt; I found (that were actually in stock) were either reinforced
passenger tires
&gt; (all season, but not all terrain) or highway rib light truck tires.
&gt; 
&gt; The brand name on the Les Schwab tire is Jupiter and the tire is
made in
&gt; Korea.  After having these tires installed, I noticed a vast
improvement in
&gt; the stability and the handling of my '71 Westy.  I no longer feel
nervous
&gt; driving in the rain (which is an almost every day occurrence in
Seattle).
&gt; So, if you live in the Pacific Northwest, I would highly recommend
these
&gt; tires.  In addition, Les Schwab's service is terrific -- I won't even
&gt; comment on the service that I received at Sears.

Jupiter is a house brand of Hercules, and the same tires are also sold
under the Merit brand.

I had a set of standard load (passenger) Hercules on my bus before I
knew better) and they were pretty good tires.  The only negative I
found was fairly rapid wear.  The tires finally failed near the end of
their tread life by internal belt separations that caused odd
vibrations.

The LT rated version of the tire should be great on your bus.  I
nearly bought a set, but noted that they were not M+S rated, even
though the standard-load version of the same size was.  Strange. 
Perhaps they've corrected that oversight in the last year or so.
