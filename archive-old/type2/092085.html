Subject: Re: [T2] Help with stove testing/repair

Most RV places will put a couple pounds in the tank and then do a leak 
check of the tank system for you.  If you want the entire system checked 
out they wil pull it into the shop.  My 82  westy ran me $100 for 
fill/test of tank/test of stove/test of refridge.  Fridge failed and I 
had them cap that line.  alternatively you can get the leak test 
solution (works better than the old soap and water) for about 5 bucks a 
bottle (I keep one on hand for routine checks).  Then have just a couple 
pounds put into the tank and start checking all the connections yourself.
