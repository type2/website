Subject: Re: [T2] Red Oil Light

The oil level should not be above the top line...keep it slightly below it.
Use 20-50 Castrol (or 40 if you can find it)
Replace your oil sending unit...period. 
Use the appropriate Oil filter...Mann or Maule (German, OE) Can get them for 
$4 each when you buy 4 from Busdepot_dot_com.
If all this fails and you dont have it in the budget for a rebuild soon, get 
some Lucas Oil Stabilizer. (this stuff works and keeps the oil in good shape 
at high temps/low pressure)
Aloha
