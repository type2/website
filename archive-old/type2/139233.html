Subject: Re: [T2] Rear Brakes locked up - should I be concerned? 

I had a problem with one of my rear brakes locking up.  It ended up I 
had a collapsed rubber brake line.  It looked fine from the outside, 
but the inside was shot.  I ended up replacing all 4 rubber lines &amp; 
haven't had any problems.

Hope this helps,
Keri
