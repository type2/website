Jeff,

Find the stuff.  It can be had, and you will be adding life to your engine
by leaps and bounds.  Ever take off the oil filler cap and look at the cork
and see a white wet looking sludge?  That is water that does not get burned
off in your motor because it never (rarely) gets hot enough to do it.

For the most part (flame suit on) this stuff is removed by people that have
absolutely  no clue how it functions, why it functions, or how to
install/adjust it, so they leave it off.  They then use the excuse that if
it sticks you will fry your engine.  Not true...it fails in the open
position, so this could not happen.  I have known several reputable vw shops
that has a matter of practice removed this stuff during rebuilds.  This
leads to little heat in cold climates, and motors that do not reach
operating temp on quick runs.  I guess it keeps these shops in business
doing rebuilds...........

There was a local vw shop in my town that removed this stuff for going on 40
years..........remarkably, stayed in business that long, too..........but,
in hindsight meet a couple of former customers of the place that have
nothing but complaints, but knew of no where else to go, for the guy had
been there so long he had to be good..............
