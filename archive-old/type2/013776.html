&gt; any tips on putting all of this back together?  anything i should do in
&gt; addition while i have everything apart?  i'm assuming i should use
&gt; anti-seize on the exhaust bolts, what about the nuts for the studs?  since
&gt; the engine is out, it is probably easier to put the exhaust manifold and
&gt; gaskets on BEFORE i install the engine?  i also bought a new foam engine
&gt; seal (thanks mice!)  at what stage should i put this on, before or after
&gt; the engine is in the compartment?

	I would NOT install the exhaust before the engine, the exhaust is
much more fragile than the engine and  will make an awkward job more awkward.
DO test-fit everything to make sure it all works- but then remove the
exhaust system. The studs can stay installed.

	While its possible to change the engine seal AFTER engine installation, 
it sure is easier to do it before! Its one more thing to push against
when installing the engine, which is why I'd leave/take the exahust off...

	Use Anti Sieze on everything around the exhaust system. On the
tin too. Put a blob on each bolt or stud and then thread the nut over the 
blob... instantly coated nut and bolt/stud. The stuff that smears out along 
any threads above the nut will add a touch of protection there too. Wipe up 
excess with a papertowel.
 
&gt; also, what tools/cleaners has anyone used to clean the engine?  the shop
&gt; fellas were against steaming the engine.

When cleaning up the tin &amp; rear engine beam for our '70 I tried Simple Green, 
Gojo orange  hand cleaner and Gunk Foamy Brite (Flamable poison) engine 
cleaner. 20 minute soak,  then stiff bristle brushing and rinse. The orange 
hand cleaner was the  clear winner and I recomend it. 

	I later determined that I could dip a brush into a tub of citrus hand 
cleaner and scrub that onto the underside of an engine or tranny installed 
in a vehicle. I think any brand will do- the combination of it being thick 
(staying wet) and the citrus oil solvent does the trick. I'm not dis'ing 
Simple Green, but the citrus- based product seems stronger.

	Naturally, when working near the engine or other moving parts, use the 
plain hand cleaner, but for tin or anything else you can THOROUGHLY rinse, 
the 'scrubbing' kind with pumice in it works as well. The stiff bristle
brush is probably almost as important as the cleaner used.
