Subject: re: [T2] rusty wheels

&gt;Take them to your local Cemetery Monument place and have 'em sandblasted. 
&gt;It's a cheap trip back to smooth bare metal. After that you can repaint 
&gt;with enamel (brush, spray or rattlecan) or have them powdercoated. You 
&gt;will need to remove the tires if you're powdercoating.

Exactly. Many places will do them CHEAP if you'll let them work on them 
when they get time, rather than a rush job.

Also check with your powdercoater, they may work with hourly rates. Locally 
it costs $40 per hour and 5 wheels (don't forget the spare) was the same 
price as 16 wheels (I had 3 sets plus a spare done at once).
