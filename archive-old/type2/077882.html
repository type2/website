Subject: RE: [T2] Cops and Busses

Interesting about the hogs not attracting cops, since
my crotch rockets always have been a magnet. Got
pulled over doing a buck-twenty on my EX down on I-16
in South Georgia. Honestly, I thought the cop was
going to just shoot me and toss my body into the
swamp, as I had just moved here, still had Maine
plates on my bike and a Maine license, and let's just
say that my accent wasn't quite southern. 

I have to admit, this was the one good encounter with
southern cops I've had, as I was told that I better
not get caught further up the interstate doing any
more than 55, or I was going to get jailed for 120,
and sent on my way.

&gt; What you are driving absolutely makes a difference
&gt; in your chances of an
&gt; encounter. As an enthusiast I've owned just about
&gt; every combination of stock
&gt; and tricked out cars and trucks. My Impala SS was a
&gt; magnet, all blacked out
&gt; and evil looking I would get stopped standing still.
&gt; Got tickets too. Same
&gt; with a Beemer. Got nailed doing 126 in a wild
&gt; turbocharged 240Z and only got
&gt; &quot; no registration in possesion&quot; ($ 10. ) because the
&gt; officer was a real
&gt; motorhead and loved the car. Have been stopped in a
&gt; Crown Vic with the
&gt; police package ironically. Stock looking pickups are
&gt; almost invisible it
&gt; seems. Have yet to be stopped in the 63 bus. 
&gt; Oddly,I've never been stopped
&gt; on any of the Harley's whether stock or custom.

&gt; 
&gt; Hello all,
&gt;  I thought I would chime in on this issue. Of course
&gt; I am gonna be the one
&gt; to go against the grain and say that the best thing
&gt; to do is cooperate
&gt; completely with the cops in the South East.  I grew
&gt; up in the Carolinas both
&gt; in the City and the way out Rednecksville.  I have
&gt; long hair and drive a
&gt; bus, I am not a hippy but have been accused of such
&gt; and really don't care,
&gt; nor am I a good ol boy. If you give the cops a
&gt; reason to get pissed off at
&gt; you they WILL and CAN do unfortunate things
&gt; regardless of its legality. I
&gt; knew cops that plant drugs on people so they can
&gt; make a quota, or just for
&gt; the hell of it.  &quot;You don't have any drugs??? then
&gt; what's this??&quot;  I'm not
&gt; trying to be a prick but you folks from the city or
&gt; the north or where ever
&gt; else need to wake up to the fact that allot of
&gt; southern cops don't care
&gt; about your rights, Who is the judge gonna believe ?
&gt; some outsider in a VW
&gt; bus or his brother in law who is the cop who
&gt; arrested you?    I have been
&gt; pulled over many times and never been more 20
&gt; minutes, I answer every
&gt; question with YES SIR ,NO SIR.  20 minutes may seem
&gt; like a long time but it
&gt; beats a night in jail and a court date.
&gt;
