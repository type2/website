Subject: Porsche repair shop fixed 75 bus-Savannah

My daughter at art school called with a bus problem after leaving the
Mall near Savannah- it had gotten colder, and her 75 would stall at idle
even when warm.  I had her check for obvious leaks and temp gauge wire
check and she drove it home, stalling at lights.  I found most of the
AIRS list obsolete for near her, but reached Charlie Ford, who is doing
well and sugg. a parts store who would have contacts, but it sounded
like they just knew bug people.  So I Googled Porsche for Savannah, and
found 2 shops- called one called AutoSport, close to her, which listed
Porsche, Audi, etc repair and they gave good vibes, saying the Bay FI is
just like a 914.  Found the leak hiding in the manifold tube to
distribution box connection- one of the boots was split at the bottom. 
Said they looked old and had been reinstalled with silicone.  They
changed all 4 with the usual labor cost to do the unhooking stuff
involving the manifolds and fuel rail.  Daughter is now happy and I am
wondering why the mechanic (which you northern NJ-ites know) did not
renew these connectors when the rebuild was done a year ago.  The
Porsche guys were impressed with its power(1800 motor) when they test
drove it.
