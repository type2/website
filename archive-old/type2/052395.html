Subject: [T2] still workin on that spark plug thread... and gauges

thanks to everyone who has offered advice! looks like time-sert is the way
to go, and i've had a few offers from people that have taps i might be able
to use... so i took off the FI thinking it might give me more room to
manouver if i decide to try tapping the head in the van... i needed to R&amp;R
the FI anyway... still pretty tight though and i don't want to screw it up
so i'll probably drop the engine this weekend and pull the head... it'll
give me a chance to look things over anyway... i think i might have a small
leak in the front seal...

i do have another question: does anyone know what size insert to get? I know
i want 14mmX1.25 but how long of an insert do i need? i would have thought
the timesert people would know but they said they weren't sure... again i
have aqn 1800 with fuel injection... and of course any other advice as to
technique, considerations would be more than welcome!

one other thing... i'm sure there's lot of opinions but i'll ask anyway...
i'm thinking of putting in pressure/temp/voltage gauges while i have it out
and easy access to the pressure sensor... any suggestions?

thanks again!
