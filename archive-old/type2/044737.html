&lt;&lt; It does bear a cosmetic resemblance, but it is not the same tent.  My

understanding is that the Andria requires a rail or bracing for attachment

to the bus, &gt;&gt;

Your very wrong here Ron.  If you knew anything about this type of tent, you 
would know that they all attach the same way.  I've seen just about every 
tent from every manufacturer and they all use the rod through the pocket, and 
clamp to the raingutter.  You may be referring to attachment to a EuroVan or 
other vehicle without a raingutter.

The Andria is a free standing tent with a double/double zippered door opening 
to your bus that gives you many connection options.  The frame is zinc coated 
steel and all corners are braced for strength.

I've been selling tents for over 3 years now, and I've learned a lot about 
them.  I specialize in side tents and other accessories for Bus, Vanagon and 
EuroVan.  I take the risks and try out everything I sell, so I can stand 
behind the products.

You will also find the same tent with the same name offered by different 
firms.  In Germany you can buy the design to the tent and have it made by 
whoever you choose.  Your competitor can buy the same design but he may not 
have them sewn to the same quality standards.  So you can have 2 tents with 
the same name and look where one is poorly made and has a cheap frame and the 
other is better made with a higher quality frame.

I guarantee that the tents I offer are quality made.  I warranty all tents 
for one year, and stand behind them as a representative of the manufacturer.  
I have also personally tried out every tent, and have traveled to Germany to 
hand pick the models I keep in stock.

Each year the design is improved upon.  The new fabric materials are truly 
great, and Reimo tents even offer features that keep the tents cooler in 
summer and warmer in winter.  

I'm always happy to discuss the tents and other accessories by phone or 
email. I'm very honest about the items and I've been know to talk people out 
of buying if I think they don't need it or may not be happy with it.

I'll be heading back to Germany the end of next month and I'm sure to bring 
back some new products and new models of tents.
