Subject: Seattle Vintage Meet

I know it's early, but does anyone have any info or a link with information 
on the Vintage Meet in Seattle.  I know the show is in mid July, but I need 
something to send to WCM so they can make plans to send a sales rep. up to 
the show.  Thanks in advance.

P.S. Also a bit early, but anyone out there planning on attending the VW 
Classic in June?
