Subject: Re: [T2] Injector seals

I don't know but my $20 set has lasted several years just fine. I got them 
from Advance Auto back when i would do business with them (when I worked 
there - before I came to conclusion that much of their parts are JUNK).

If all I had to do was change them once every 5 years or so then $20 is 
okay with me.

I suspect several brands of cars and vans used the same parts and the $6 
per version is in the name.


&gt;There seems to be two prices for seals.  the 60 cents kind and a Bosch kind
&gt;for $6 each.  Is there enough of a difference to warrant paying this 10x
&gt;price?

&gt; &gt; Replace those seals - costs less than $20 and your local flaps may 
&gt; carry them.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; When they leak it causes a vacuum leak.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; I'm going to replace the little hose pieces to the fuel injectors and the
&gt; &gt;&gt; gasket blocks and intake runner boots at the same time.  Do I want to
&gt; &gt;&gt; replace the seals for the fuel injectors?  Is there an alignment required
&gt; &gt;&gt; afterwards if I do?

Ciao!
