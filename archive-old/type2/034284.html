Subject: heating your fuel in winter

Hi Volks,
  An on going thread about winter gas mileage says;
      &quot;The reason cars run less efficiently in cold weather is because 
gasoline
&gt;doesn't vaporize as well.

Sounds right to me, and reminds me of the way fuel lines are coiled in
backpacking stoves to prewarm the fuel on its' way to the ring where
combustion happens (I'm browning out on the name of it, at the base of the
flame).  I assume that's why VW ran the heat riser along the intake
manifold.

Anybody got a safe method for warming the fuel just prior to the fuel pump?
I'll bet the truck manufacturers have this one figured out.

Well in some turbine powered aircraft there is a unit called a fuel/oil heat 
exchanger.  As the name implies heat from the oil is transfered to the fuel. 
  Cools the oil and heats the fuel.  Now those of you with external coolers 
could probably run you fuel and oil lines side by side for the winter and 
them seperate them in summer to prevent vapor lock.
