Subject: [T2] Dual solex carbs

Well, last week I installed the new Solex carbs on my 72. Upon checking out
these carbs, supplied by Bus depot last winter/spring?? (Big Thanks, Ron),
the following was noted. Accelerator pump rod was severly bent on one carb.
The float level in both carbs was 3mm low. Spec float gasket is 0.5mm, they
used 1.0mm. Main jets were 132.5. Stock is 135. One mixture screw was 2
turns from the seat, the other was one turn. Stock is 2.5 for initial
adjustment, and they came with factory plastic non-tamper plugs to keep
them from adjustment to true. Both throttle valves required considerable
adjustment to set spec, again fitted with non-tamper caps. That's almost
every initial adjustment on there. Much time was spent putting them right
BEFORE installation. 

This is not news to me anymore. It is typical. That's why I ALWAYS check
specs, even on new carbs. I can just imagine the troubles some have had
with these new carbs if they did not verify ALL the specs. 

Everything set up and adjusted and tuned per Bentley. A Type IV motor
cannot run better than this. Soooooo nice. So I followed up and put on new
rear drums and shoes. Pulled the e-brake cables and cleaned the tubes. Put
it all back together. All adjusted to spec.

So nice not to die at every stop sign without the heel/toe routine. So nice
to have an e-brake again. This sucker is so nice to drive now, I'm thinking
of a complete disassembly and strip to bare chassis for total restoration.
I will set up some custom tool storage and have a mobile service vehicle. I
expect at least 5 large out of pocket and a similar value of my time to
finish. It's either this or a bunch more for a UniMog that is geared for
continuous operation at no more than 45mph. But then, a UniMog could eat
Detroit for lunch as far as REAL off road 4 wheel driving is concerned and
at half the cost of a Hummer.
