Subject: Re: [T2] CV bolt not Torx!

&gt; You are right, the socket is the way to go!!!  One of these days I will
have
&gt; all the same bolts, right now I am mixed up between the 2 kinds.
&gt;

On that note.... Does anyone know a supplier of the CV bolts.  Other than
Bus Depot.  I bought out there last 8 yesterday.  (Need 24 total) And have a
fresh tranny with fresh axles going in my 74 and I need the bolts,
desperately....

Can anyone help???

Snoopy
