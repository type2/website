&gt; Wiggle your fuses!  Don't laugh, it cured the &quot;one-eyed monster&quot; for me
&gt; the other night!

Also consider that on 71's (and I dunno what other later years) the
lights don't come on with the ignition key off.  So if the car's off and
you pull out the headlight switch....   But more to the point, that
thang may be buggered in the ignition switch.  If you had to bypass, I
forget if the headlite switch connection (the one where it senses
ignition switch position) is activated with or without current, but I
think it would be the former.  I mean, it makes sense.

Only real way to tell is to start tracing it.  eg does the headlite
switch output connection to the 56 circuit have juice when the switch is
pulled out? etc.
