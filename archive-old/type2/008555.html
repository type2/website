Hi Bus Friends,

I recently bought a bus, and have been getting it in daily driver 
condition (Eric, Barb, and Clara have been incredible with their help). 

My engine is rebuilt. It has an alternator, not a generator. The red 
light stays on at idle (the engine is generally idling a little slow, but 
better than it was), and then appears to go off during normal driving. 
However, when driving in the dark, I've noticed that the light actually 
doesn't go off completely--it sort of glows softly. It just isn't bright 
enough to notice during the day.

Should I be suspicious of a belt, or should I start elsewhere (or just 
not worry about it)?

Also, on another topic, I don't want to start a holy war, but what is the 
best kind of fuel to put in my bus (i.e. octane) and is it important to 
use a lead substitute? (I understand that there is a concern for engine 
wear when some grades of unleaded are used.

Thanks all,

Dan

P.S. I don't know if this is relevant, but I've noticed that the horn 
doesn't want to work when I first start up (and this is when the light 
seems to be the brightest). At other times, it seems to work fine, once 
the bus is &quot;warmed up.&quot;
