&gt; Where do you connect your CHT gauge?
On my '71 Westy I cut the loop off the connector and wedged what is left 
between two fins on the underside on the # 4 cylinder head.  If you do it 
this way try to approximate the &quot;spark plug&quot; location and be sure to keep the 
sender away from the cylinder head studs.  They are big heat sinks and you 
will be essentially be reading the case temp.
I just built an engine for my son's '72 Beetle.  I JB Welded the sender to 
the underside of the # 3 cylinder.  It's too early to say how well this will 
work, but it should work out really well.  The JB folks say their product is 
good to 550 F.
I hope this helps.
