Subject: fuel line

Folks,

Last week, my 1978 fuel injected Type 2 started to smell like gasoline. (RED
ALERT! RED ALERT!)

I have isolated the fuel leak and am looking for parts. There is a metal
fuel line that connects the fuel pump with fuel injectors 3 &amp; 4. Between
injectors 3 &amp; 4, this fuel line has articulation with a screw in it. I
assume that the articulation is there to support bleeding the fuel line.

Does anybody know where I can find this part? Even better, does anybody know
where I can find a kit that contains every metal tube and rubber hose that
transports fuel through my bus?

My wife won't let me fix the fuel leak with duct tape ;-)
