Subject: Re: cleaning up oil on garage floor

&gt;Laundry detergent works great for getting oil off of concrete. Pour it
&gt;on; for really thick greasy spots, apply a little wirebrush action,
&gt;let it sit for a while, hose it off.

DANGER, WILL ROBINSON! DANGER! DANGER!

This practice can lead to procecution under the Clean Water Act and the Oil
Pollution Act of 1990 and could result in fines of up to $50,000 and up to 5
years Federal time if any of the oil/dispersant mixture finds its way into a
&quot;navagable water&quot; (loosely defined as &quot;All waters that are currently used, were
used in the past, or may be susceptible to use in interstate or foreign
commerce, induding all waters that are subject to the ebb and flow of the
tide;...&quot; and &quot; All other waters such as interstate lakes, rivers, streams
(including intermittent streams), modulation, sandfills, and wetlands.&quot;). The
use of dispersants (anything that emulsifies the oil, allowing it to mix with
water) is something the Feds really go after (it demonstrates criminal intent,
and the use of a dispersant allows for an additional $25,000 fine to be
levied).If you are found guilty of criminal discharge, you will be forever after
a convicted felon. Federal fines are only the tip of the iceberg. There are also
state and local laws, and you can be held financially responsible for all costs
associated with the cleanup of any oil they can prove you discharged. 

I'm not trying to jerk anybody's chain here, but I personally know of an
individual who did nearly this exact same thing (the only difference was he used
solvent instead of soap, so no dispersant was involved). He rinsed the whole
mess down the drain in his garage, which was connected to the storm drain
system, which dumped into the bay. The Feds traced it back and nailed him big
time. They couldn't prove intent (he claimed he had an oil leak) because they
didn't have the added evidence of a dispersant. 

So, BEWARE. They don't care if you don't know about these laws. People have been
prosecuted who spilled oil as a result of a traffic accident.

Yes, if you follow this line of reasoning, you could be prosecuted if your
vehicle leaks onto the street and it runs into the storm drain/creek/lake/ocean.
Probably won't happen in this lifetime (unless you have a really bad leaker),
because there is simply too much happening to follow up on. 

The legal (and environmentally responsible) alternative is to absorb the oil and
then take it to the local HazWaste facility. Heat (an old iron) and paper towels
can be used to draw oil out of concrete. DON'T wash oil down storm drains or
into gutters. More oil is illegally discharged by individuals annually than the
Exxon Valdez spilled into Prince William Sound. Oil spilled into water
eventually evaporates/biodegrades naturally (killing a bunch of birds in the
process). Oil dispersed into the water column (using detergents, Gunk (tm), and
driveway cleaners) is absorbed by all the living creatures using the water,
poisoning them and us. Used motor oil contains all kinds of really bad stuff.
Adding dispersants to oil makes a bad thing a million times worse. If you must
use a dispersant of some kind, make sure it goes to the waste treatement plant
(read: down your household drains IF you're hooked up to the city sewer). They
may have rules governing what/how much you can pass onto them via your sewer
line, but at least the Feds won't be after you, and you'll sleep better at night
knowing the stuff is getting treated.

If anybody wants information about related topics, contact me via the list or
e-mail and I will do my best to provide you with it.

my to-do list.
