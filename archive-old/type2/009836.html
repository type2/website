Subject: need help identifying engine
Message-ID: &lt;19990614194218.54800.qmail_at_hotmail_dot_com&gt;

hmmm...well, my '73 isn't running yet (still need some parts: plugs, wires, 
distributor, etc.) but i'm having a real hard time finding the right parts.  
i've checked RMMW and all the other places, but my problem is this: they all 
say that i have a dual carb engine for the year it is...but it's 
not...there's just one...any clues as to what engine i have anybody???  the 
guy i bought it from said that he &quot;thinks&quot; it's an 1800, but he wasn't 
sure...any indications on the engine itself to help me determine???   also, 
the VIN# is weird...i've consulted all the places with vin interpretations, 
and they all have 17 letters and numbers...mines only got 10 numbers...i 
don't understand it...oh yeah...and the sunroof...a list member told me to 
take off the lower panel by the spring clips or something like that...but i 
can't get to the front-most edge of it cuz it's kind of seated into the roof 
on that end...i really want to get that working, but i'm still quite a 
newbie, so any help would be greatly appreciated...  also, if anybody is in 
the madison, wi area, i might need a hand with some things (which there 
would be a fee for if need be) and would love a little guidance...
thanks..
