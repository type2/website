Subject: Re:fuel pumps

Hi Jim, 
	I had a fuel pump die a couple of years ago.  My fault-&gt; I ran the
tank dry-&gt;do not do this-duh.  I now have three years on a junkyard pump I
pulled.  I also have a couple of spares.  At $10 each one can carry a few
extras.  Do check for restrictions but I would pick up a couple of used
pumps as insurance anyway.  It is a mission critical item in a FI system.  
	I also picked up a couple of spare injectors, an FI loom, relays
(Double and single), ignition electronics (83 Vanagon CA model) and an
ECU. For less than $100 I'm sure none of the parts I now have spares for
will ever fail again ;).
	I find a spare double relay very useful for checking the FI
system.  I have a partially melted one (from a fire damaged van) that
allows me to &quot;make&quot; the contacts by hand and listen for the pump, test
fuel pressure and check system voltages without using the key (and needing
a helper).
