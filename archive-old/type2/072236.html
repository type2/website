Subject: fuel lines

Travis,
   Sorry that I'm a bit late for this thread. However, I just did what
you're planning to do. I just replaced my fuel lines, all the way from tank
to carbs. You don't have to drain the tank, just be quick when you pull the
old hose off the gas tank and push the new one on. Make sure you have the
hose clamp already on, otherwise you'll have to do it again. I did the job
in several steps:
(1), Disconnect battery to avoid sparks, especially when working under the
car next to the starter motor. Start by replacing the hoses between fuel
pump and carbs.
(2), Pull the hose coming from the tank off the fuel pump and plug it with
a screwdriver.
(3), Check and clean the little fuel strainer inside the fuel pump (now's
the time to do this, since you're not getting fuel all over yourself !).
(4), Measure and cut the correct length of fuel line from the tank to the
pump. This includes changing the fuel filter that should be sitting in this
section. Attach line at the pump end and guide the free end of the hose so
it's lying next to the tank outlet.
(5), Pull the old fuel line off the gas tank and push the new one on b4
you're getting too much gas sprayed over you. Secure all connections with
hose clamps.
(6), Start engine and check for leaks.

Best of luck !

Gregor
