Subject: Re: [T2] Synthetic gear oil okay?

&gt; &gt; &gt; I've had synthetic Valvoline 80/90 weight in mine for years,  now I have
&gt; &gt; &gt; an automatic so I only have it in the final drive but have not had any
&gt; &gt; &gt; problems. and the GL 5 problems do not affect synthetics
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Your automatic doesent count :).
&gt;
&gt; why I mentioned it
&gt;
&gt; &gt; And I wouldnt be so sure that the GL5 problem does not apply to all
&gt; &gt; synthetics.
&gt;
&gt; but he was specific to the Valvoline

yes. so  i checked the valvoline synpower and it says MT-1 so it should be
ok. but some of the synthetics have also been reported to be too slippery
and cause shifting issues. So I still lean to good old GL-4.
