&gt; &gt;the petro chemicals do shorten the life of  latex gloves especially gas,
&gt; 
&gt; I use latex gloves, I find them invaluable as prolonged contact with oils,

I use nitrile gloves for solvents like gas, the can last about 15 min in
direct contact with it.  For some reason (maybe marketing) these type of
gloves are always blue, and are somewhat less elastic than latex gloves,
but still disposable and easy to work while wearing.  I get them via my
work, but I am sure they are available in any saftey products catalog.
