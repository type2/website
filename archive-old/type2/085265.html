Brian,

The best way to remove sticker's off paint is go to your local
automotive paint supplier, and purchase a 3-M stripe and lettering
remover---

It is a rubber wheel you chuck up in your drill, and let the wheel do
the removing--simple, fast, leaves no glue residue, and above all
doesn't damage the finish under the sticker.

I've been using this set-up for 25 year's to get vinyl lettering off
door's of semi's prior to painting---

One note---wherever a sticker was--there will be a noticable
shaddow----the sun has been fading the paint all around the
sticker----not under them---

I do not have any molecular data on the compound of the wheel--it just
works good.--:&gt;)

Later,


Terry

Hey everybody, 
I just bought a mostly rough '71 camper that has a number of stickers
all over the rear. I'd keep them if they were at all interesting and/or
in decent shape, but they're not. 
Does anyone have any suggestions for removing old stickers from painted
surfaces without damaging the paint? 
Thanks,
Brian
