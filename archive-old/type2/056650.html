I used to make the TARPS and hoops etc for p/us.  I don't anymore but have
1 kit left for someone like you.  This includes the correct natural canvas,
the front window, the correct webbing straps, ALL the correct GERMAN
grommets... everything to make one up, Authentic.  I put this kit together
for a guy, months ago, been in my living room collecting dust forever.  His
price was $275    Your get-it-out-fast-or-I'm-single-again-price
$195 +ups
