Subject: Re: [T2] Dual carb troubleshooting techniques needed

Hey guys and Richard   You can also just stick each tube down into the carbs  
I watched MUD set up a set of carbs at one of the campouts and it was sweet . 
It is done just like normal except you dont switch back and forth between the 
carbs  later and have fun  Mark Dearing
