&gt; &gt;     All right, before I get lynched all my comments were tongue in cheek and
&gt; &gt; many based on Nikki's own observations. So let it be known that Nikki and I
&gt; &gt; are friends &lt;gulp&gt; and I was happy that it was her that was able to save
&gt; &gt; another bus from the crushers. Let it further be known that we all, SO, kids
&gt; &gt; and Nikki spent most of the day making sure the bus was transported safety
&gt; &gt; and followed that up with A&amp;W floats on the way home to have a nice dinner.
&gt; &gt; My son has decided that Nikki is his girlfriend, so in a way, she has already
&gt; &gt; been taken home to mom. Okay put down the rope!
&gt;
&gt; And I'm not even holding a gun to his head! ;-)

Y'all;
   It's done. Just a fast (which usually ends in &quot;foot in mouth syndrome&quot;)
reaction.
