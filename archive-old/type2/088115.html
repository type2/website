You know this Tire thing is crazy.  I have a friend who has a Bay Window
with tires rated at 1400lbs, to low my some folks standards.  He's towed
other Buses with it, and hauled 35, yes 35, bags of cement in the thing
without an issue.  What does a Bus weight  anyway?  Seems these on the
back should work.

First I've got to give a collective &quot;thanks&quot; to everyone on this list.
I have had aircooled vdubs for 15 years now, and since subscribing to
the list, my 1970 is running better than ever. DETAILS! 

 My present concern is the tires currently running. The T2 library and
current tire threads are suggesting D rated tires.  I really had no idea
what I was running until this morning.

Goodyear Decathalon on the front: 195/75R14 
                                                   max. load - 1400lbs.
                                                   max. pressure 35 psi
                                                   1 ply sidewall
  Kelly Explorer (Exploder?) on the rear: same specs as above.

Is this dangerous? All four have plenty of tread. Should I replace all
of them, or maybe just the rear and run my tires on the front?  

Thanks, Dave
