Don't get too excited guys...Diane Sawyer said something to the extent
of, &quot;she and her daughter go camping in their 'Scooby Doo van'...&quot; as
they showed the picture of a late 70's green and white camper with a
straight up pop top. It made me cringe, bad PR!  Nice to see she has a
bus though. Paul
