I have long since trashed the original post, so I'll hope that the original
poster will catch this...

Before you go to Sears, you might want to check out Harbor Freight.  I got
a 3/4 drive METRIC socket set (22-46mm w/ ratchet, T-bar, 3 &amp; 6 in
extensions...) from them for $29.95 that includes both 36 and 46mm sockets.
The local tool guy wanted much more than that for one socket.  I've used
it professionally for years and never even come close to bending the bar.
I regularly use a 4 ft. (1.25m) cheater on it.  Chinese tools made with
slave labor, but it works for me...
