No.  Full throttle is fine around town, just not when climbing long hills.
You engine can absorb the heat of momentary full power, but long periods
of it tax the cooling system

&gt; My second question is about the warmup procedure - the motor seems
&gt; veeerrry unhappy when cold - I definitely can't start it up and drive away
&gt; like I used to in my '79 - what is the normal procedure for warming up the
&gt; engine before driving away?

Mine drives fine while cold.  Perhaps you need to check the carb settings
and make sure the choke is operating properly.
