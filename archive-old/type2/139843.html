&gt; So what is the remedy for the mayonnaise syndrome?  I don't drive my '79

I've never seen this when using synthetic motor &quot;oil&quot;

&gt; westy too much in the winter; however, I do notice the mayo on the valve
&gt; covers or oil cap the few times I drive to the coast in the winter and
&gt; decide to check/adjust my valves for the 600 mile ride home.  I don't
&gt; see these symptoms in the summer.  Whad up with that?

I take a lot of short hops in my 78 and several times a month longer trips
of 50miles or more so it I would guess is considered &quot;severe&quot; service.
I've always used synthetic in this engine and have never seen mayo.  I
have flaps but no thermostat.  (for a couple reasons it won't work right
on my engine)

YMMV
