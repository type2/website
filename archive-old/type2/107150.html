&gt;The principle of a Hydraulic lifter is to adjust the loading so it is in
&gt;the MIDDLE of its range of motion, allowing for both wear and stretching
&gt;due to heating.  I once measured the piston range and it was at least
&gt;2mm as I recall; the 2 turns puts this in the middle.  Too few turns and
&gt;you risk the piston slapping the snap ring 

What??  There will be no slapping going on if there is zero preload.  My take on it is as follows:

Too many turns is dangerous (first symptom - low compression or burned valve)
Too few turns is safe (first symptom - valvetrain noise)

I keep mine turned in about 1/2 turn because I want to be on the SAFE side.
