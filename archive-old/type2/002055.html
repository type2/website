    I have a 66' splittie and I need to put a couple of new windshields in.
I have tried the wire and liquid soap thing but the seal is different from a
bug and it isn't very easy. Any suggestions? This is kind of urgent I need
to cover the two big holes in the front if you know what I mean.

Thanks,
Dave
