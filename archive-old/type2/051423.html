Subject: [T2] Westy Ranch (I call it)

Many of you may remember the mention of such a place while my family and I 
were stationed outside of Ft Irwin California.  Well, after much deliberation 
I've decided to pass the info on.  The owner of all these vehicles is a dear 
friend of mine and a true VW die-hard.  Thus the reason I will indulge you 
with the details.  He is one of the few people you'll never forget meeting 
and can't wait to meet again.  I'll list his e-mail and a phone number.  
Please only use these resources if you are of the same like mind and are in 
the habit of not driving the directions you ask for.  Time is precious.  And 
if you are the type that is one for free parts after we all go to sleep, 
remember the desert is a big and rough domain.

Peace Out
