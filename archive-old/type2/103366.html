Subject: URGENT-ENGINE PROBLEMS-PLEASE HELP-

I recently dropped the engine in my 72 bus so I could replace the
clutch.  Now that the engine is back in the bus, I am having problems
with it firing.  I am getting spark to the distributor and the carbs are
getting gas.  Why am I not getting any spark to the spark plugs?  Is the
distributor not lined up and do I just need to pull it?  I am kinda in a
bind.  I have to get it running today, for there is a wedding I need
attend this weekend in Tampa, FL.  This is an 8 hour drive.  PLEASE
HELP.

Dean
