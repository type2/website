Subject: Re: [T2] Temporary filling of holes in rocker panels???

&gt; Has anyone had any experience with the inner rocker panels that are cut to
go around the
&gt;under supports as opposed to the piece that is not notched? The notched one
looks a lot easier
&gt; to use.

Similar to the skins: one is supposed to go over the remaing rust to cover
it up (the notched panel). The other is the inner rocker if you replace the
entire rocker. Only possible if you remove the outer and inner rocker (aka
restoration). I would not bother to order inner rockers. All you need is
some sheet metal, shears and a vise to fabricate the patch panels you need.
It is a good idea to keep patches small and not to layer to much metal over
each other. Every cavity you create (i.e. the room between the old and the
new skin) is just asking for more future rust.

&gt; Also, I want to seal the panels for the winter so no salt/water gets in to
cause further
&gt; rust. My thoughts were one of the following:
&gt;
&gt; 1) Use undercoating spray on cardboard to create a patch. Let it dry, then
cover the
&gt; cardboard from the outside with spray on undercoat so it is waterproof.
&gt;
&gt; 2) Make a plug of expanding foam for a temporary fix, cover with
undercoat.
&gt;
&gt; 2) Use a single thickness mat and fiberglass for a temporary fix that can
be ground off
&gt; later.

None of the above ... Cardboard and foam just soak up moisture and make
things even worse. Rockers rust from the inside out. Thus, holes are good:
the water gets out ... The less crap you put on now, the less you will swear
when you clean up things to weld in new patches. Stay away from undercoating
- it will make things only worse be trapping moisture inside.

If you have holes that are big enough to cover with cardboard, your rockers
are completely toast anyway. No reason to preserve anythting over the
winter. Even if they look good in some places from the outside you will
probably decide to cut these sections out when you have looked inside or
tried to weld patches to them and keep burning through.
