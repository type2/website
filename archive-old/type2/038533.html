Subject: Shouldn't Oil Cooler get Air Flow?

Hello,

Does it make sense that when hot (thermostat expanded)
that the stock oil cooler is totally covered by the
flap ('72 1700).  The flap (driver's side) drops down
to allow cool air to the engine, but in doing so
completely covers the oil cooler. 

The Library indicates that when hot, the flaps should
be &quot;fully open&quot;; similar to if you had no cable
attatched.  However, this blocks the oil cooler.

I'm wondering if I need to set the flaps somewhere in
mid range instead of all the way open.  That way the
oil cooler would get some air across it.

Thanks
