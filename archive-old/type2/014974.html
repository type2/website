&gt;I have had coil over shocks on my 78 Westy for at least 100k of its over
&gt;200k life...couldn't find mounted ones and used the clamp on kind, having
&gt;to space the shock out a bit so the clamp wouldn't hit the sidewall.  Does
&gt;anyone know of a correct fitting shock (brand and #) for this&gt;???

Thanks for reminding me of this.  I too used the clamp-on coil springs over
my shock absorbers for probably 100,000 miles before finding out about the
coil-over shocks.  The ones I use on my '72 are Napa #58598.  I think they
are made for a Dodge van, but with a a slightly longer top mounting bolt
they fit right on my bus.
