Message-Id: &lt;v03110702b44d3960952e_at_[209.214.193.176]&gt;

&gt; Who of the engine builders/sellers uses new AS21 or AS41 cases. Prefurably
&gt; AS41!! Are they even made still??
&gt; IS the only differences the higher aluninunum.  Do these have the cast in
&gt; behind the #3 like the 79 FI case.  What is the best case to start with?
&gt; Without taking Citibank to Gene Berg or Pauter!!

    they should all be fairly competitive, but try calling up rimco, in
santa ana, ca... they used to have 'em for around $375 each. they will not
have the back filled in behind #3.

    do note that you should be shopping for quality instead of price.
overall, these new cases are not perfect from the factory, so make your
purchase from a vendor that takes the time to fully inspect the product they
sell.
