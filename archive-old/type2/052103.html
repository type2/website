&gt;Hi All,
  This morning it will not start
&gt;at all.  It sounds like there is no spark at all.
&gt;
&gt;My question is this.. could the heavy rain all night have cased any
&gt;problems?  maybe some condensation somewhere causing electrical probs?
&gt;

Yes, indeed, Nick. Make sure the distributor cap is dry inside and out, and
also the top of the coil is clean and dry and all the wires as well. If the
HT wires are hard and taken a set or cracked at a level you can't see with
a glance, replace them, not with wizbang NASCAR stuff, Bosch.

Make sure the points are in good and dry order if that's what you got, or
if you are electronicfied, blow dry the connector at the distributor and
inside. Protective boot torn or gone?? There you go. A spray of light
penetrant oil inside will displace any water hiding in the cracks. I had an
old Chevy pickup years back. Every morning with dew I would have to damp
off the coil before it would start. 

If that don't do it, validate spark at the plugs, then validate the cold
start injector is spritzing when cranking, then that the bypass valve is
open when cold. Big open for big cold, little open for little chill. Then
there is always the dreaded temp sensor. Bentley has the info for
inspecting all of these.

Many times, perpetual poor starting can be due to poor compression and or
short plug life due to same and or valve guide wear. Also, the starter
motor or it's circuits won't let it spin quite as fast as it should and
cleaning up a poor path there will greatly improve starting. If you have a
foundation weakness like this, any subtle prob with something new can
become the item that gives you the &quot;Now it won't start at all!!!&quot; syndrome. 

A synergy of weaknesses in mechanicals, electronicals and fuel/air
alchemicals from lack of maintenace with age is a commom culprit. Nothing
like a Standard Brand cap and rotor to give you fits for a year cause &quot;It
just got replaced so that can't be it??&quot;. Veryify spark at the electrodes.
Then verify spark at the coil.  You may not have looked close enough to see
(with a good handglass) if it came with a crack right out of the box. The
kind of crack that becomes an excellent path with water in there that makes
a poor start become a no start.
