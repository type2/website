Subject: Re: [T2] Is there a EZ way to clean the tank?

Try a bottle of Chevron Techron FI cleaner and a couple of fuel filters.
I use a 92 Ford  FI Crown Victoria filter on my Westy and its about five
times the size of the stock VW.
It also has a check valve so nothing washes back into the tank.

&gt; Like a MIRCLE cleaner that you put in, wash out, I don't know. I 
&gt; guess I am not looking forward to the task of taking the tank out to 
&gt; clean it...
