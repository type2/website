&gt; Guess what : the intake lifter on cylinder #3 was as solid as a rock.
The cylinder wall and head were black &gt;with soot.

Ben,, I am certainly no expert on hydraulic lifters,, but when I bled a
couple of sets here,, I found that a Rock solid lifter is GOOD....

&gt; The other lifters had varying degrees of compressibility.
&gt;

These lifters need to be bled..... i found that if your not carefull when
your bleeding them,. they will become so SOLID that you can't get the
circlip in,, and you have to start over again,,,


&gt; Someone at a local VW shop had told me about bad hydraulic lifters in
type 4 engines and this confirms it. I &gt;believe that Boston Bob had an
article about it too.

If you had bad lifters,, the engine would knock, it would be noisy,,,
I can't see the engine getting hot because the valves would be closed
longer, and they would cool more,,


&gt;
&gt; I bought a replacement set of lifters from CB Performance (their so
called high speed ones) and hope that those will run better.

One thing that seems to be very common is rapid wear on NEW lifters put
into an engine with the existing cam,, as the cam and the lifters are not
a matched hardness,, the harder one will rapidly wear the softer one..


&gt;
&gt; The bad news is that Leonard at AVP refused to honor the warranty,
citing that the engine heat tabs had &gt;fallen off which, IMHO, is yet
another chicken and egg story : would that had happened if the hydraulic
&gt;lifters were good?


I have seen AVP warrenty stuff that I would NEVER expect to be covered,,,
they have no control over things like distributer timing, fuel air
mixtures, etc..

Do you have a CHT gauge, or oil temperature gauge? if so, what temps was
the engine running at,,
