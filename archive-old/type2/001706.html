I am afraid I have to agree with the few who have publicly slighted Bus
Depot. I had a hard time deciding whether I wanted to flame them on the list
or not. I used to have a link from my web page and I wanted to like them!!
I have ordered from them 4 times and was never happy. Always took an
exceptionally long time to get my items. I tried to buy my pop canvas-be
about 10 days they said. I called wolfsburg west and had it in about 4 days
from California to North Carolina. One time I specifically told them to
check to be sure the items I wanted were IN STOCK when I placed my order,
yes they assured me they were. Of 8 items I only got 5. &quot;They are on
backorder&quot; I was told when I paid for the phone call to find out. Rather
than apologize they said they could refund my money and hung up. I called
wolfburg west and had my missing parts in 4 days. I received the wrong part
once(a beetle visor retainer), but at about 2 dollars didn't even bother
with calling. I realize every company has a few orders that they can't get
out quickly, but I haven't had any good experiences with Busdepot. If you
have let me know!!!
I don't buy from them anymore. I recommend Bus-Boys.

&gt; Best prices on bus parts anywhere guys.  The reason is that Ron shops.
&gt; Sometimes takes a little while to find a part probably.
&gt;
&gt; Also - the 1-800 number is very obviously stated to be for ORDERING by
PART
&gt; NUMBER only.
&gt;
&gt; You got money to spend on bus parts, you got money to make a phone call.
&gt; RTFM.

&gt; It kinda what you get when you order from them. I have already this
&gt; year ordered close to 1k worth of stuff and continue too. I wait and
&gt; wait but eventually they get there. The only beef I have with them is
&gt; when you try to call the 1800 number to say that something didnt come
&gt; but was on the packing order and your asked to call the long distance
&gt; number. Should I be penalized for something I didnt receive, I got it
&gt; taken care of but the call cost me $1-2 more on top of my order.
&gt; Other than that Im very happy with the service, the quality, prices,
&gt; and the knowledge. Sure they are slow (Im still waiting on a lot of
&gt; items) but who the hell cares unless you are in need of a part, if
&gt; you want it faster order from somewhere else.
&gt;
&gt; just my two cents.

&gt; &gt;I didn't notice anything in your post about trying to contact their
&gt; &gt;customer service department to air your grievance.  If you haven't
&gt; &gt;done that, maybe it would have been appropriate prior to bringing it
&gt; &gt;to the list.
&gt; &gt;Just a thought.....
