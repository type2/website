&gt;&gt;&gt;I think the going rate for a good late westy is in the 4k-buck
range.  If you add the cost of the new head or heads that this one
seems to need them to $3000, you're lookin' at about fair market
value. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;

$4000 for a good Westy sounds right to me. But after all of the work
I've done on my '76 since purchasing it  last May, I would keep in
mind that there's always more time and expense involved in motor work,
etc. than one optomistically expects.  

I picked up my bus from Pat Flynn in Annapolis, MD for $650.  Now
after spending almost another $2,400, I've got a bus with a good
running motor with 2 new cylinder heads, completely rebuilt/new
exhaust system (for a total of $800 including labor &amp; welding, ouch!)
and a number of new pieces here &amp; there (front disks, bearings, 1
injector, vacuum tubes, drivers'door, etc.)  Of course the front
arches are rusted away and the front left panel is pretty banged, but
I've learned a lot and enjoyed it.    

In terms of the bus that Ian is looking at, I would do a compression
check on it, or any other bus I was considering purchasing.  Then I
would get ready to enjoy my bus and also be prepared to deal with the
unexpected as I got to know my bus.
