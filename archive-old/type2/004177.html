&quot;When the guy in charge of OSHA compliance found out about the sandblaster
he went ape-sh*t. &quot;

Yeah, it's true.  The silica sand is extremely hard on your lungs, and likes
to stay down there, sawing little slices in your areoles (did I spell that
right?).  Adequate respirators don't cost all that much (I think I paid $25
or so a couple of years ago), and you can actually breath with one on.
Those so called surgical masks you pinch over your nose do almost nothing at
all to filter particulate out unless you seal them to your face with
vaseline.  Don't do that, get the right mask (and seal IT to your face).
Well, I don't seal mine, so...  But I don't ever sandblast without it.  The
idea is to grow old and have fun in the bus, right?
