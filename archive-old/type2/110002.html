&gt; 2.  Pull the flaps and thermostat..you just don't need them.

Maybe true if you live in a constant 70 degree+ environment.

&gt; 3. Set timing &quot;by ear&quot;  ..........every bus i have seen where these
&gt; goofballs have done that it is at least off by 10 degrees......._dot_usually
&gt; because there is a big vacuum leak they are masking

If there isn't a problem elsewhere, this should be possible. My father also
used to set valves by ear. In fact, I think this was the recommended method
for some older Chevys. Tighten the valve until you hear a slight clicking and
back off a quarter turn. Of course, that pits your piston... But you're doing
a rebuild every 25K miles, right?


&gt; 4.  Doing things in such a fashion that no manual ever stated.like undoing
&gt; the front (bell housing side) of the tranny with the engine to pull a
&gt; motor................not the whole engine and trans at the same time mind
&gt; you.......but just letting it dangle by the front motor mount............I

Except for the dangle part, this is an accepted method to make aligning the
engine and transmission if you don't want to pull both. This is the preferred
method for many Porsche owners as well.

Remember that back in the 50s and 60s, no one intended an engine to last much
more than 75K to 100K miles. GM and Ford wanted you to buy a new car every
couple years! And VWs were practically considered 'disposable' cars,
especially the engines. We have very different standards now and we try to
apply those standards to our VWs. But that's what keeps them on the road.

Even VW can be seen as guilty of such crimes. Why the heck didn't they put
temperature sensors or tachometers on the busses?
