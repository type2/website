I've borrowed tools from AZ before when I was trying to remove a tie-rod. Although rental is essentially free (they return your deposit) their one tool for all models loan program doesn't always work in your favor.

Also keep in mind that they are used tools that you are borrowing: inspect them before you borrow.
