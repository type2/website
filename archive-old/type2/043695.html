Subject: Engine Mounts Riddle

Hi Volks,

(i)	Just fishing for the answer to this riddle.
	How easy is it to fit new engine mounts on a 1973 Bay. (fixed rear
valance?!?)
	Can I do it myself as a novice, the old ones are apparently perished?

(ii)	Is there a winter/summer setting on my engine. A mechanic told me that
it was
	set on a winter setting. If so can I change this easily?
