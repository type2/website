Subject: Re: [T2] propane valve?

Hi Dan

Yes, the valve can be replaced --easily--,,,  To get one, go to your local
Propane filling station, you might have to look for one that does commercial
industrial forklift tanks etc.,, 

Ask *them* where they are available locally?

Be sure to tell them you want a POL valve, NOT an OPD valve as on new 20lb BBQ
tanks

You can NOT use an OPD &lt;overflow protection device&gt;  as the opd uses gravity to
open it, and excess propane to close it.. and you are going to install it
[almost] upside down on your &quot;permanently installed RV&quot; tank. Thus gravity will
close the opd, and the propane pressure behind it will keep it closed..... 

Open your valve in an open area with no sparks.... and release the propane that
is left.  Open the &quot;fixed liquid level gauge&quot; screw when it appears empty and
make sure no more propane comes out. Proof that the tank is not under pressure
any more.

The valve threads out just like any plumbing fitting,, lefty loosy,, righty
tighty,, IT is NOT left hand thread into the tank,, but it will be snug!

Put the new one in with PROPANE approved pipe thread sealant and do not
overtighten it.

You do NOT need to &quot;purge&quot; the tank after this, unless you get moisture into the
tank. Propane is heavier than air, so air usually does not displace the

&gt; Hi!  I have a 78 westy with the propane tank in the normal position under the
&gt; slider.  The on / off valve leaks badly.  Can they be replaced?  If so where
&gt; would one get a replacement?
