Subject: Re: 1971 bus retrofit

&gt; 1) Has anyone every retrofit a 1971 Westy with the
&gt; 75'
&gt; and later interior and top? I don't remember the
&gt; details of the roof hole well enough to know whether
&gt; it would work well (as in 'bolt up easily.)

I am not sure about those specific years but I had
done a 68' transporter bus retrofitted with a 74' pop
top and interiors. I have to tell ya was the best bus
I ever had. The top bed was bigger that the original
68' cod. You can actually have 2 adults up there. I
have now a 69' and if I were to find another 74' or at
least all the parts I'll do it in a hart bit! are you
planning some thing like that!
