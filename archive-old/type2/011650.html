To: type2_at_type2_dot_com

Hey Volks,

Could someone remind me if there's anything special I
need to do to test a generator, and what the voltage
output should be? 13V-ish sounds familiar, but I'm
sitting in my office away from my precious manuals,
and want to make sure I do this right. Assume I have
tools with me. 

-John
