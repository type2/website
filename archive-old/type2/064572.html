you'd definately be able to sell your parts... the only problem is your
timing.  being the end of the &quot;season&quot; here on the east coast, i think
the only show nearby this year is the one in central New Jersey on October
6.  Not only is it a car show, but a good sized swap meet and also drag
racing (if you are into these things).  both of the vw mags have info and
a number to call to order a swap space.
