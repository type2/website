Subject: Need Copy of Manual for Propane Stove &amp; Fridge??

Hi,

Can someone let me know if they have the separate manual for the 
Stove for a 1979 Westy.  Also is there a separate manual for the 
Fridge.

I would like to have a copy faxed to me.  If you have it please email 
me and I will give you my fax number.

Thanks for the help

Joe
