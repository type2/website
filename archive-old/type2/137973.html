Subject: RE: [T2] Can't get engine out

Although you have done this before, I'll mention some items just to make
sure :)  I remember the rear tin causing most of my problems when removing
the engine.  Make sure the tin is removed and also the oil filler tube.
Also, if you are lowering the engine with a jack and the emergency brake is
engaged, you should be able to pivot the engine back and forth while pulling
to the rear.  Lower then engine a bit and grab something sturdy on top of
the engine to pull back on.

Hope this helps.

&gt;I've done this before and don't remember it being quite this difficult :-(

&gt;Any pointers?
