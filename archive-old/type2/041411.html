Hi all! I started off the day on a great foot. I went to the MVA and got tags 
for my bus. So cool. I can't believe after all the hard work and blood 
(literally) It's finally on the road. Mind you that it needs a paint job. But 
it's running FANTASTIC!
Oh, I went to the eastern shore of Maryland today (in my Jetta) and passed a 
late bay westy tan, with a plate on the back &quot;It's not a VW, its a Bus&quot; 
anyone on the list? I waved and felt good karma back!
I'm going to sign up for the busses by the sea in August, for my first BUS 
In. Hope to meet lots of you there!
Anyway, everyone have a great weekend!
