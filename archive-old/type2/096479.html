Subject: Re: [T2] Kerosene:


You have to look around for &quot;parts cleaner&quot; but you *can* find it.

Look in the phone book under &quot;oil marketers&quot; and then call...ask who they 
deliver to that has what you want.

And *please* do not dump it.  I live in the country with a water 
well....if i dump it, i drink it.  yeccch!

The local county hazardus waste disposal folks are great.
Left about 6 gallons of parts cleaner with them about a month ago.
They don't want it in the ground either!!!

Cheers, dave

&gt; I'm surprised that you can't find a convenience store or gas

&gt; Any auto parts store or even a Wal-Mart type store should sell gallon jugs

&gt; 
&gt;     I use &quot;var-o-sol&quot; (check spelling) in my parts washer. I used to use kerosene, but I find it gets so nasty in everyday use. At any rate I buy them both from the local Exxon distributor (their the guys that sell the gas and oil to the service stations, so any brand will have it), there in the yellow pages under Oil Distributors. Another good thing, it costs less.
&gt;     For a one time use, get few gallons of Diesel fuel, not near the fire hazard as gas, and you can get anywhere, but its still nasty.
&gt;     One other thing, keep in mind where your going to dispose of what every you decide to use, any of it will be &quot;Hazardous waste&quot;. Don't get caught dumping it!
