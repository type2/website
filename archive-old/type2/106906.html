&gt; He has fire extinguishers in all his vehicles

Just a little note on fire extinguishers.
I was driving home on the Freeway and came upon a burning Beetle.
I pulled over and grabbed my fire extinguisher to help out.
The extinguisher was in the van when I got it and the origin was unknown.
Pulled the pin and squeezed the handle and nothing happened.
The sad beetle driver had the same results from his.
A third driver brought out his extinguisher and it too failed to work.
By the time the Highway patrol arrived the car was totaled.

My point is 3 out of 4 fire extinguishers failed to do the job for which they 
were intended.
Check your fire fighting tools regularly, check the gauge, push the little 
indicator button if so equipped and turn them upside down and shake em.
The ingredients will settle and compact to the bottom and fail to deploy 
properly when needed.
If unsure of the age, origin or condition of your extinguisher, get a new 
one.
And check those fuel lines! 1oz prevention = 1lb cure
