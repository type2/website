Subject: Turn Signal, emergency flashers revisited. 

Hi Everyone,

I have tired everything to get my turn signal and emergency flashers to 
work.  I have posted the list before and received some awesome ideas.  I 
tryed them all and finally gave up.  I have been revisiting this problem 
this week, and again I'm stuck.
The emergency flashers do not work.  When I pull the knob out, not even the 
bulb lights up.  The turn signals do not work either.  When I engage the 
turn signal, the green light on the dash board lights up.

Here is what I have tired.

1.  I removed the emergency flasher switch and tested it according to the 
Bently manual.  It's good.
2.  I replaced all bulbs.  Ones in the rear and front.
3.  I replaced the fuses.

When I removed the connections from the emergency flasher switch, I thought 
I would remember how they went back on.  That could be the problem as well, 
I should have taken a digital picture.  Is anyone able to send me a digital 
picture of their switch?

I have a 78 ASI conversion.

Thanks very much in advance,
Don Manzano
