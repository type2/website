&gt; Buskatier had mounted train airhorns to his roof rack along with a large air

&gt; through the campground.  Matt said the air tank could run the horn for 5
&gt; minutes straight, he and a friend tested it before the trip.

I hate to be a spoil sport and I hope he got the horns legally, but lately
there has been a rash of RR train horn thefts, and at least a couple
accidents have been blamed on the lack of horns.  these are very loud
horns for a reason and they are VERY expensive to get one legally,  expect
to pay over $500 for a legal RR horn.

the Railroads are cracking down and each horn is serial numbered in hidden
locations and the fine for possessing one without proper reciepts can be
quite high, it is a federal offense.
