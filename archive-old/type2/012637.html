If I were doing this I would use Formby's..
http://www.formbys_dot_com/
  The site will give you some info... the strippers I have
used require gloves and saftey glasses but do not seem to
dry out the wood like some do. This product line has been
around for many moons.

Side note:
for wiring supplies check out http://www.waytekwire_dot_com



Hi....I am helping my friend fix his 71 non-pop top Westy
The wood paneling is peeling off the top layer of what 
looks like varnish
I think its because the previous owner used a propane camp 
stove to  much and 
it became moist....
the wood is fine, only the finish is flaking....
is there anyway to make it look right again ?
