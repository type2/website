Subject: Exhaust nuts: copper vs. stainless

Hello List,

I have heard good things about stainless steel exhaust nuts. I've used 
copper nuts with good success. I'm cleaning up a 2000cc Type 4 and I'm 
considering trying the stainless.
I have a few questions. I know there are so-called copper nuts out there 
that are really just copper clad steel nuts that will rust themselves to 
the studs. How can I identify these? use a magnet?
I recently bought an EMPI copper nut kit from CIP1 and the nuts look 
different than the ones that came with my exhaust kit from Bus Depot, 
and those look different than the ones I already have, which I've been 
using with good results. They are all locknuts.

I have a ton of stainless locknuts in the same size. Are those an 
upgrade from the copper? Would I be better off using the (more 
expensive) stainless lock nuts to avoid poor quality copper clad nuts?

I am using stock german 72-74 heat exchangers and an original german 
muffler on a type 4 engine. This includes 8 head to HE nuts and 6 HE to 
muffler nuts.

Does anyone have experience with both copper and stainless steel nuts?
