Subject: Fuel Tank Thanks

First off, I would like to thank the list members for their fuel tank =
insight and concern for my personal safety. I am quite leery of the =
properties of petroleum based fuels and respect their potential (I use =
the proper diameter fuel lines and even safety-wire them). I have often =
read the list with some scrutiny as to people removing the engine =
cooling tin or modifying a properly engineered system. I have now found =
myself considering that very thing. I have decided to attain the proper =
FI tank for my bus and avert a few headaches. Does anyone have a good =
used fuel injected tank out there? I will also have a nice non-fuel =
injected cleaned, etched, and polymered tank for sale.

Todd
