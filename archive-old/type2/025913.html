I have a 1979 Westy with a rusty gas tank. I can go about 100 miles before I
have to replace the fuel filter. I cut the filter in half and was shocked to
see all of the rust in there...
Will the rust eventually flush it self out?
Is pulling the gas tank the only way to clean it?
Can I get it out without dropping the engine?
And does anyone know where I can get a new tank? (If I have to remove the
tank I'd rather put a new one back.)
Ronnie
