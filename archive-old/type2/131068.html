Subject: Re: [T2] Painting wheels with POR

Or you could just POR-15 it.  I just did the floor of my old van with it
and it settles nice without ripples. All with a nice quick brush stroke.
Then choose the paint of your choice and color and it's done.

Yah it's that easy.. or was for me..

this to me is an invitaton to the item refinished going to hell again--
