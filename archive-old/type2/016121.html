Subject: busses.....

Thom...vw busses are the best. I stumbled upon your page because I'm
looking to buy my first car....and I want it to be a vw camper ('74-'79)
preferably '78 or '79. I don't have a  lot of cash and live in
Canada..do you know where I could find one? Youve got one hell of a page
there buddy...I love it.
