I'll second that - my 71 had a rusted out vent frame so I found a
one-piece glass at a junkyard and replaced it using Ron's seal (WCM, I
suppose) and it looks great!  Not much need for rear vent wings in a
westy with jalousies.

&gt; 
&gt; &gt; I want to replace the left rear vent/window combo on &quot;Clem. II&quot;
&gt; &gt; with a solid piece of glass from the right rear of another bus.
&gt; &gt; Can a non-vent rear window seal be used on either side?
