Subject: Re: Needed: Cabinet handle in Westy 

&gt;the small handle on the drawer/cabinet above the ice box (and below the sink)
&gt;has cracked and broken. This is the one with the plunger mechanism. Anybody 
&gt;have an idea where I could find a new one?

Tim,
    I don't have the fridge / sink, but from looking at pics, the handles are 
the same as the other cabinet handles (someone correct me if I'm wrong). You 
could look at a local boneyard, but most likely the handles you seek are 
either gone or broken as well. Try The Bus Depot, Inc.  www.busdepot_dot_com if 
they don't have it, try GoWesty! www.gowesty_dot_com You might have to call them 
to see if they have it (read Bus Depot's post about Bad Phone Day, though). 
If they don't have it, I'll keep an eye out for three - I need two!

Peace to a fellow '72 Westy owner!
