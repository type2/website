&gt; Hello Everybody:

&gt; I have a 71 bus with power disc brakes that operate off of intake manifold
&gt; vacuum.

&gt; The problem is, when I step on the brake pedal, the engine RPM
&gt; starts running really high, at least 2000 RPM.

You've got a leak in your vacuum booster, which means that it needs to be
rebuilt/replaced.  You might be running too rich at idle as well, since
this usually causes stalling due to a way-too-lean mixture.
