Subject: Can you boil a Carb?

Hello,

I have taken my dual carb solex apart (on my 72 1700cc) and given them a 
good cleaning. I have used steel wool, wire brush and solvent. The passages 
will be blown with compressed air soon. But there are some hard to get spots 
that I can't get to. So I was wondering if I could boil (maybe with some 
bleach or vinegar)the carb? Will this clean the carb or harm it? Has anyone 
tried this with any success?

Thanks in advance, Phil.
