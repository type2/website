&gt; &gt;Oh come on, Captain.  :-)  I installed A/C in my bus for under $500.
&gt; &gt;It can be done and done cheaply if you have some time, and if you want it
&gt; &gt;badly enough
&gt;
&gt; Sorry, I own both Vanagons and a Eurovan.  If the original poster needs
&gt; a VW and needs handicap access with A/C and auto, there is no reason not
&gt; to get an early Eurovan.  The modern conviences of A/C, auto, and P/S

and what is wrong with a bay window bus,

&gt; The really over-riding consideration is the driver's seat.  The Eurovan
&gt; seat sits flat on the floor, while the others sit on the wheel well.
&gt; In order to have the flexibility to add a seat that is handicap friendly
&gt; there is no other choice.

if you can transfer then the OEM seat is always the best. and the VW
captains seat fits on the drivers side bay and vanagon

B&gt; It's water-cooled, front-engined, etc, but it's still a VW at heart.
&gt; Give the Eurovan some consideration.  There is a Canadian company that
&gt; does conversions with lifts, etc. I think I found them with a Google for
&gt; RVs based on the Eurovan.

one, VW has a rebate program that pays $1,500 towards the cost of
modifying a Eurovan for disabled access.

two  the Eurovan IS BLOODY EXPENSIVE!!!!!!
