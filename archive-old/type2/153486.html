Subject: Re: [T2] Best bang for the buck tires.

Terry said:


&gt; Someone came up with a posting a week or two ago--not here but on one of the Vanagon lists, while having
pretty much same kinda tire discussion.

&gt; Now--with all factor's added subtracted, &amp; divided, from the formula
which Mr. Chase has come up with the hoops I described were withing the proper parameters of load range
safety.

&gt; The minuim weight rating on each tire factored in at 1400 lbs using Mr.
Chases formula--or the DOT's anyway.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* Larry's website page on the correct tire has disappeared. It was:
http://www.roadhaus_dot_com/Tires/Guideline.html
But in it, he said the weight rating was 1560 lbs for the correct reinforced sidewall or Commercial tire. Not
sure where you are getting the 1400 figure from.
All Larry has now on his Roadhaus website is this link:
http://www.roadhaus_dot_com/tires.html
And if you look at the 1st tire listed, a BF Goodrich, it says Max load 1515 lbs. and then below it it says
Meets Specifications: NO

What you are confusing is total weight a tire can handle sitting still vs total weight a tire can carry while
moving.
From the NHTSA website:

Maximum Load Rating
This number indicates the maximum load in kilograms and pounds that can be carried by the tire.

Key word is &quot;carried&quot;.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

&gt; The advantage of the radials were to be able to rolll with the road in a
corner, where the bias tire sidewall didn't.
The rolling of the sidewall in corner's especially on the wheel was
allegedly the ticket for long tire wear &amp; a big advantage in handling &amp;
stability.

&gt; Now ,all of a sudden this theory is out the window here in VW land.

&gt; How Come?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* All of a sudden?!?

No, VW has specified the correct tire to be either a reinforced sidewall or a Commercial tire since the mid
70's in print. Go read page 53 of the 79 owners manual
http://bama.ua_dot_edu/~darren/vw/Page53.html

On the Tire Sticky on the Samba website, I posted pics of page 51 of the 78 owners manual but the website is
gone now.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

&gt; If the radial tire isn't up to the job, why don't folks just go back to
 the stiff sidewall bias ply tire's?

&gt; This sure makes plenty of sense to me--
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Getting educated makes more sense........
