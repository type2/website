&gt; I checked the timing statically and my light came on at 12 degrees BDTC on 
the scale when the notch hit it. 
 &gt;Now some say the notch is o degrees and some say it is  5 degrees BTDC. 
 &gt;If it is 5 before than the timning is about 7 BTDC-good enough for me. 
 &gt;If the notch is zero then my timing is off.  
&gt;How would I go about changing it if necessary? 

Double check your timing without relying on the pulley notch. crack open the 
valve covers and distributor cap, 
turn the motor with an adjustable wrench on the alternator nut while watching 
the #3 valves open and close, 
At one point in the cycle #3 intake and #3 exhaust will be opening and 
closing right on top of each other, the 
point where they're perfectly even, ie, you can see both tappet screws mesh 
and appear flush while looking 
straight in from the rear, thats' your TDC for #1. Now look at your crank 
pulley and make a mark at 12 oclock
with white out. That's 'Zero'  Now your timing should be 7.5 btdc, a bit to 
the left of that. Is there a notch to the left 
of that or a timing scale indicating 7.5btdc? At this point you can either 
time it statically with a test lamb, turning the
distributor to where the light 
comes on, then tighten the clamp so it doesn't move easily and test drive it, 
edging the distributor counter-clockwise
after each ride til you find the smooth spot, but where it doesn't overheat 
or ping, or you could pick up a sears 
advance knob timing light and be precise.
