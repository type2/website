Subject: Re: [T2] intake manifold question

The manifolds in your picture are the short 72 only
manifolds.

73-74 are taller with EGR valves mounted in them.

The short 72 set-up requires you to use the round
metal air cleaner.

Because of the taller 73-74 intakes, they used the
square plastic air cleaner. 

The supports that bolt on the case for the air cleaner
are different for the round and square air cleaners.
A while back I posted a picture of the of the 2
different mounts on the Samba. If I was not at work, I
would send a link for them.
