Subject: Re: [T2] Fuel Injection transplant
Date: Mon, 9 Jul 2001 08:35:16 US/Mountain

&gt;I have a 1974 transporter with an earlier 1.7 litre engine. I 
&gt;presently have a progressive Weber and I would like to get rid 
&gt;of it (I think most of you know the reasoning) in favor of the 
&gt;J jettronic fuel injection system from a later bus. Is there a 
&gt;method to adapt a 2.0 FI system to my 1.7. I have  a set of 1.7 
&gt;injectors from a 914 that could be used.

Why not just install the whole d-jet FI from a 1.7 914?  That way everything is 
designed to work together.  Admittedly the l-jet system used on the 75 - 79 
buses is more modern (and presumably better), but the smallest displacement 
engine it was ever used on was a 1.8 (with much bigger valves than the 1.7 
had).  

To run either l-jet or d-jet (sorry, I don't know anything about j-jet) on a 
bus not originally designed for it, you'll need to make the following 
modifications:
  -&gt; Obtain and test all the pieces for the FI system you're going to use 
(obviously).
  -&gt; Swap gas tanks so you've got a return fuel inlet.
  -&gt; Drill the head above #3 cylinder to mount a head temp sensor and cut a 
corresponding hole in the tin for the wire to pass through.
  -&gt; Possibly deform your cyl tin slightly around the intake manifolds to clear 
the runners (I had to do this for the d-jet FI I installed on my 73).
  -&gt; Rind a spot to mount the ECU, electric fuel pump, and any other misc. 
sensors the FI system uses.
  -&gt; Figure a way to mount the FI air cleaner box.

BTW, I'm not familiar with newer than 79 buses.  What year did they start j-jet 
FI?
