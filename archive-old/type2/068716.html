Subject: 68 Singlecab FS

A buddy and I are looking at a 68 (I think) single cab.  The body is pretty
straight, a little rust here and there, but really pretty good overall.  The
sides are all there, as well as the belly doors.  It also runs pretty good.
 What would be a good price for this?  We want to know what to offer the guy.
 Any help would be appreciated.  Thanks...
