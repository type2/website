Subject: Re: Vanagon thermostat

&gt;My 2000 vanagon AC is missing the little wheel that lets the thermostat turn
the
&gt;corner.  The cable is too short too, so the engine is always at full cooling.
&gt;This situation can prevent the motor from warming properly in winter time. Bad
&gt;for the engine and bad for the cabin heat.  Does anyone know of sources for
&gt;these parts other than VW???  John Jensen in Annapolis 

John (and all you others that use the excuse of non-availability of parts to not
run a thermostat):

Honky on down to the local well stsocked hardware store. Lookie in the
department that sells replacement parts for sliding glass patio doors, mirrored
closet doors, and such. They're usually in the hardware dept. Look for the wood
handles that fit the sliding glass doors... they're pretty easy to spot. Look
around the pegs for a card with (usually) two brass pulleys about an inch and
three quarters in diameter and about a quarter thick. They're the wheels that go
on the bottom of those sliding glass doors. They're about $6 for two. They have
a hole in the middly about 3/8&quot;, and have ball bearings in them. Now you have
your pulley. Truck on down to the other isle, where the chain and cable is. Get
about 3' of cable the same size as the thermostat cable (which I think you still
have, if you don't, bring your thermostat with you so you can find a bolt that
fits in it where the cable attaches). This can be soldered into the bolt that
attaches to the thermostat (or the bolt that you bought), and viola! You have a
thermostat cable. Alternately, you might check your local VW dealer... they can
probably get the parts for you in two or three days.
Happy Hunting!
