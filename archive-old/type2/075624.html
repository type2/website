&gt; If it never got above 20, carb icing probably wasn't the problem.  I'm

I tend to agree.  If the carb did ice up, engine heat would have melted
the ice after the engine shut down.

To ice, the air has to contain humidity at a temperature above freezing.
At temperatures below freezing, the air is already dry.  You can get icing
at temperatures as high as 60F if the humidity is high.
