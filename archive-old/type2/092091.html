Subject: Re: [T2] RE:  914 motor into a bus (was 0mile engine)

Mike,

The exhaust system might be part of it.

Something else I thought of was the flywheel and clutch assembly.  A big
thing for the racers is to cut down the flywheels to reduce rotating
weight.  You'll see adverts for 11 lbs or 12 lbs flywheels in the Bug
racer supplies.  That allows them to rev all the faster with reduced
momentum to overcome.  The bus assembly I'll bet is a lot heavier than
the 914 Flywheel and clutch. 

Just an idea.

&gt; I've been pondering the differences in my 914's engine characteristics vs my
&gt; bus's engine characteristics.  Both are completely stock 914 2.0 motors with
&gt; the exact same FI system.  I've even gone so far as to swap virtually every
&gt; FI component from one to the other.  And still the fact remains:  the motor
&gt; in the bus just won't rev like the one in the 914.
&gt; 
&gt; I can barely get the bus motor up to 5000 rpm while I'm contantly bouncing
&gt; off the 5400 RPM rev-limiter in the 914.  At first I thought it was just due
&gt; to the extra weight in the bus, but that would not explain why, sitting
&gt; still with the cars out of gear, I can rev the 914 and it whips up and down
&gt; from 1000-5000-1000 RPM in much less time than it takes the bus to wind up
&gt; and down (say maybe 1 second vs nearly 2 seconds).
&gt; 
&gt; My (as yet unsubstantiated) conclusion is that the stock 73 bus exhaust
&gt; system is too restrictive for the motor.  What else could it be?  Both
&gt; engines have close to the same compression ratio (ranging from 125 - 135).
&gt; Any idea how one could home-test the breathability of an exhaust system?
&gt; Something like assemble the heat exchangers and muffler, plug 3 of the four
&gt; manifold openings, blow air through and measure the resistance somehow?
