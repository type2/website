I don't remeber who puts the show on but I'm sure it is not the Kascade
Kombi's.  It is an all Volkswagen show not just Type ][.  
I also don't have a phone number but can answer some of your questions.
You can stay at a local motel, I can get you numbers.  I'm not up on the
local camp sites but I can check the yeller pages.  I know at the back gate
the night before a ton
of people camp out in a parking lot.  There is a swap meet, and some
vendors with toys (2 to 3?) no lit that I remember, except the stuff the
swap has to offer. (maybe a little bit) No cruises but maybe we can get on
going for the list? Sounds kewl to me, to bad my van dosen't run. But I
could drive my dads (and hope the front spindle doesn't fall off seeing it
needs replacement.
 
&gt; Isn't this show put on by the Kascade Kombi's? How
&gt; do I get in touch with them for more info. If we come
&gt; (from Boise ,ID) where to stay, and how to get there?
&gt; Are there any cruises etc the night before? swap
&gt; meet, Toy and Lit?
&gt; Thanks in Advance
