But you know you can't!  :)

&gt;Go here and read the section on 'viscosity index improvers' and then remember
&gt;all the posts that ask &quot; is 230 to 250 too hot??&quot;
&gt;http://www.vtr_dot_org/maintain/lubricants-redline.html
&gt;Think it is all BS? Here is another site with info on it, but not as
&gt;informative as the 1st one:
&gt;http://www.eskimo_dot_com/~dalus/bmw/all/misc/all_oilfaq.html

Interesting stuff, thanks for the links.

&gt;questions!! BUT they have changed the BS slogan on the front now. They now
&gt;say: &quot;Engineered For Greater Protection Against Breakdown&quot;. Hmmm, I wonder why
&gt;they stopped using the word &quot;Thermal&quot;???  But, alas, it still includes
&gt;'thermal' on the back.

I don't like misleading advertising.  Another one I hate is &quot;Engineered for 
higher-mileage engines&quot;.  What the heck is that supposed to mean?  It's 
just a meaningless slogan to appeal to those who don't know the first thing 
about engines but want some kind of warm fuzzy when they buy thier oil.

&gt;But just like tires, you guys are gonna use whatever you want.

I think that's a little bit harsh.  I'm sure that the tire discussions on 
this list have influenced many people to buy better tires.

As for oil, I'd like to know exactly what relationship thermal breakdown 
has with oil pressure.  Does thermal breakdown manifest itself as lower 
pressure?  I would think so, but I don't know for sure.  I ask this because 
many years ago when this multi-weight bashfest began, I was moved to try 
straight 30 weight in place of the Mobil-1 15W50 synthetic I normally 
used.  I noticed an immediate and substantial DROP in hot oil pressure.  I 
drained the 30wt and put in 40wt and the hot oil pressure was then about 
the same as the 15W50 synthetic, but at cooler temps of course the 40wt 
doesn't flow as well so I stayed with the synthetic to be easier on the 
engine at startup.  I've run multiweight synthetic ever since (97k miles 
now) and have been happy with it.

Is it possible that even though multiweight oils break down at higher temps 
that they are better for an engine because of more rapid lubrication at 
startup?  Could this be why they are so popular now?
