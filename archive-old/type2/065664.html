Subject: i'm baaaaaak! update stats

hello everyone,

the unlucky '72 camper owner from athens, GA has returned!  i am glad to
be back.  i doubt if you even missed me, but i have returned after about a
month of being list-free.  it was kinda harrowing.

i still have not had a chance to tear apart my '72 engine that everyone
diagnosed with a dead rod bearing.  hopefully i will be able to do it
soon.

well, i am sure you will be hearing from me again.
