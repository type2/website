Subject: In need of a roof rack for a '71 bus...
Message-ID: &lt;372A49D6.524A_at_worldnet.att_dot_net&gt;

Hubby and I will be touring this summer in our '71--to Alaska.

We have decided to get a roof rack to stow the bulky-light stuff on.  

Does anybody have a source for new racks, or a good used one?  We don't
necessarily need a vintage rack, though it would be nice if the price
were right.

Thankyou,

Lauria Watts
