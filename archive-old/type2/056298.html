Hi volks
Guess there is lots of advice on this one- I had a similar problem. Try
loosening the adjusters - guess they are stuck -mine were. I then soaked round
the hub with WD40 and still would not move, even by hitting drum with a soft
mallet. Left overnight and tried hitting to create some leaverage about the
centre of the hub, i.e. using the centre as a pivot. This did eventually work
and then came off easily. You will have to get the star adjusters out and
clean up the sleeve. I regreased the star with anti seize and put together
with antisieze on the contacting surface on the hub and drum and being careful
not to get on the inside of the drum or near the shoes etc. Also found that
the holes in the backplate for adjusting the stars were very large cos of
forcing the star adjusters with something (screwdriver, I guess). If these
holes are not sealed up a bit, then water gets into the bottom and helps seize
up the adjusters. I found some grommets and filled in with a little silicon.
I notice a drum puller in Bentleys but never seen one that will fit a bus cos
I guess they need to connect on all the wheel studs to get an even pull. I did
try othe pullers but not big enough or poor fit...
Don't give up--- it took me four hours of playing.... etc !!!!!
