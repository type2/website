Chris... sometimes when the engine end of the cable gets to that bend in
the rear of the tube... it can get stuck.  Don't dispair.  Have a friend
take a light hammer and firmly tap the end of the tube while you are
pressing that cable in from the front of the bus.  the vibration will
help get the cable pass the bend.

I can't believe I knowt his but I do!

This is the first time I have posted advice to the list!   Gee... its
amazing what you can learn in just a few short years.
