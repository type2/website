Fellow Listees,

I am planning to attend Josh's funeral on Friday.  The outpouring of
sympathy from the List is overwhelming.  I thought it would be nice to be
able to pass along the thoughts and well wishes of the List to Josh's
family.  To that end, I am planning to collect the e-mails from listees and
compile them.  I will give this to Josh's family at the funeral.  If you
wish to be part of this, please get your e-mails in to the List.  I will
take whatever is there by 5:00 Thursday, Central time.

If any of you think this is a particularly bad idea, please p-mail me with
your concerns.  I promise this will be handled in the nicest way possible.
I also intend to remove the e-mail headers.  My intent is to convey how much
we thought of Josh, to a family that may not know.

Rob Dahlgren
