List -

I have a '73 bus and my right hand, rear, lights are out.  I've tried making 
sense of the wiring diagram, but I'm not that electrically inclined.  The 
bulbs are fine and they are making contact, but nothing works.  Does anyone 
know which fuse I need to replace?  (There are couple that are blown)

Thanks-
Michelle
