Subject: VW Sighting

I was watching &quot;Access Hollywood&quot; (I know, I know) while surfing tonight and
they showed an actor from some TV show called &quot;Coupling&quot;. They interviewed him
for his orange late model Westy. I wish mine was that clean looking, maybe
when I'm a big TV star, it will be :)
