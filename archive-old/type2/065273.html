Subject: fuel hoses

Ken mentioned that the metal fuel pipe that goes thru his tin LOOKED ok
until he inspected it closely; I've found that they almost always have been
nicked enough by the tin to be a hazard. I've replaced all my hoses and
metal tubes with one long rubber hose from the tank to the carb. I have a
nice thick reinforced rubber hose (like 1/4&quot;) which I run the fuel line
*through* where it enters the tin; another covers the line where it passes
over the manifolds and heat risers. I have a glass inline fuel filter,
which sometimes worries me. I intend to replace the lines with metal hoses,
just as soon as I can find a marine fuel filter and an inline OFF  valve
that will accept the fittings. My neighbor has a burned bus in his shed
with nothing left but the front glass, so I have a daily reminder to keep
me paranoid!
