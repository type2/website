Subject: checking if case align bored??
Message-ID: &lt;36ed7740.24635b23_at_aol_dot_com&gt;

I have finally decided that my trusty 73 is or seems to be on her last legs.  
I am going to rebuild a spare engine I have, so when it is done I can just do 
a swap and not lose any (hopefully) time without my transportation.  

about a month ago i got a longblock from a mechanic friend for 20 bucks.  i 
figured i would use it someday.  it had a broken valve on one side which 
means that one p/c and head is shot.  what i need first is to build a short 
block.  how can i find out if the case has been align bored??  i have  a 
micrometer to mic the crank, etc.  But dont I also need to check the case??  
If this is not necessary let me know and I can get started on this project.

**ps  does anyone recommend doing anything special to the crank in regard to 
*shot peening* magna fluxing* or whatever.  I found a bit of info on these 
procedures but I have never done it on any of my rebuilds over the years.  
Should I be doing this.??  Any opinions???
