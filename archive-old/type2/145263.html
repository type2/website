Subject: POR-15 gas tank sealing

ok guys, her it goes....
 
1) bought the kit.....all made by the POR-15 people
2) read the directions....that one is a biggie
3) removed the crap with the &quot;marine-clean&quot;
4) used the &quot;metal-ready&quot;...most of the rust turned black
5) dried out the tank, by this time it's midnight, so my thoughts are &quot;I
will coat the inside of the tank tomorrow&quot; and the tank will be good and
dry.
 
I look in the tank in the morning and the rust is there and red again and
now some new surface rust has appeared......CRAP!
 
So I am panicking now...do I go ahead and coat the inside of the tank or
not?
 
The POR-15 guy said the &quot;metal-ready&quot; coated the rust with zinc and
everything is ok, coat it - the rust will stop.
 
I am just looking for some more opinions from others that have used this
stuff before.
I have used stuff like POR-15 on motorcycle gas tanks.....if you mess up it
is ok 1 bolt and you can start over but not this beast!
 
Any thoughts?
