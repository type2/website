Subject: Westy &quot;Step Stool&quot; wanted

Let me refraise my previous request for the VW politically and terminology 
correct:

I am looking for a &quot;four-legged&quot; step stool that fits between the &quot;jumpseat&quot; 
and the sink.  I don't really care much about color even though I have dark 
brown vinyl instead of the mustard color.  Any leads would be appreciated.

Sorry about the previous posting, I've owned/raced/restored/rebuilt and lived 
VW's for 20+ years and I still cannot get my terminology correct.
