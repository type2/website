Subject: How to be a really responsible bus owner

Do not assume that you will be the last owner of your bus. If you 
maintain it well, you won't be. Someday you will be the PO. So this is a 
prod to future POs not to be pissants.

If you do a non-spec alteration like Hoover's bulkhead fitting, document 
it and put the documention in with rest of the bus's paper trail. In this 
case, just print out the instructions, draw a rough picture, and stick it 
in the package.

If you wonder why you should bother, when the PO before you never 
bothered to do this, just see Plato, &quot;The Republic.&quot;
