       Certainly they can be re-hardened. In fact you can do that sort of
stuff quite well in your home shop, so any commercial shop would be doing
that, you'd think. How well they do it, however, is something else. And, no,
I don't mean to imply that you will get the same results at home with your
oxy/acetylene torches and cans of carbon or cyanide compounds as a
commercial heat-treating shop, but you can do fairly well with a bit of
practice. Pretty easy to re-harden things like screw driver tips, hammer
faces, home-made gun parts, etc.
