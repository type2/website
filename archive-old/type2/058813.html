Subject: side marker lenses

 Hi volks,

Just wondering I have a 73 kombi with only 1 (driver side rear ) red
lighted side marker lens.  The other three are  yellow and reflective only.
 My question is are they all supposed to be lighted, red?  Also I just
replaced the bulb in the red one never worked before, never knew it was
supposed to, but now the turn signals look like they are on speed or don't
blink at all.  Could this be related ?  Maybe the bulb being too big?

Peace

Snoopy
