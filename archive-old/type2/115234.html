Subject: Pos/neg side of coil

Hi Volks-

Happy Friday!

I was going to replace my coil today, but have hit a glitch: How can I tell
which is the negative or positive side of the coil? My new Pertronix coil is
marked with both a positive side and a negative side, and my old Bosch is not
marked. With the ignition on, both sides of the old coil read as positive.
Did I get the wrong kind of coil?

Cheers,

Matthew
