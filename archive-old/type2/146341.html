Subject: Replacing Brake Servo

Okay did alittle searching on the archives but didn't really come up with
a good answer.

Got a type2 with a bad brake servo(might not be the servo but I already
bought it and seeing how these seem to be a failure point, I might as well
replace it)

What I want to know is how hard is this to do myself?  What pitfalls
should I be aware of and will I need to bleed the brakes after installing
it?  Are there seals which I will need to replace when re-attaching the
master cylinder?

It seems pretty  straightforward, theres only about 6 or 7 bolts that I
need to worry about.  The adjustment is all I am worried about.

Lastly, is there anyone in the seattle area that has a dry place I can do
this at?  I found out after I bought the bus that it won't fit in my
garage and my driveway is both too short and has too much of a grade to
safely use jackstands on.  Thanks in advance.

-Zach
