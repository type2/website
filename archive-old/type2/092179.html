Subject: Re: [T2] Re: Magnets

I'd think that a transmission can use a magnet to catch steel gear
fragments, but a vw case has bronze and aluminum that will not be
caught.  Steel may come from the cam, lifters, pump gears?  Re cow
magnets; my wife is a DVM pathologist and says they are stainless metal
over ferrite (iron) magnets, no chance of shattering.  Wouldn't want one
in my engine, and I'd think a small one in the sump screen woulda been
put in by the Deutsche engineers if it would help?  This should not
affect a crank whizzing by.
