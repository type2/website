Subject: St. Muir

Many of us are greatly indebted to the musings of John Muir and his profound=
 writings on VW repair, many of us have also cautioned each other on the=
 errors that Mr. Muir included in his writings. As a conductor (music not=
 electricity) quite often I get a list of &quot;errata&quot; for a particular piece of=
 music. Perhaps we should include a list of errata for Muir's book in some=
 archive somewhere.  Things that Muir reccommends but could potentially be=
 very damaging to your vehicle.  Those of us who use Muir first before using=
 bentley or haynes or whatever could avert disaster by simply checking to=
 see if the procedure being reccommended is the best one for whatever it is=
 we are doing. I use Muir more than any other source, but being a novice=
 mechanic, I don't always recognise the damage that the questionable=
 procedure could cause.
