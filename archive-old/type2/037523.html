Subject: Friday:  Bus Depot comes thru &amp; bus sighting

Four for four.  This order was placed Friday Feb 11, received confirmation
Monday the 14th, order arrived Monday the 21st.  Complete, correct, in good
condition.  This order took a trifle longer than the other three, but that
service is still pretty quick by my gauge.

Adding together the cost of four orders (roughly $200 each) from Bus Depot,
plus Maureen's purchase price, plus miscellaneous odds (and some ends)
purchased at the FLAPS, I now have almost as much into Maureen (over about
1.5 years) as I do in REPAIRS to my 88 T_at_urus wagon over the same time.

Couldn't sleep Mon nite, got up around 1am, watched the SciFi channel.  The
Outer Limits episode &quot;Music of the Spheres&quot; was on.  Blonde cutie drives a
splitty.  Looked pretty good, as did the bus.;-)   'twas a real bus, too;
sky-blue with a gray primer driver's door...

P'rfesser
72 bus, &quot;Maureen&quot;
