Subject: rear hatch seal

I recently purchased a rear hatch seal for my 71 westy from bus depot (part #211-829-193C, as listed on the invoice). According to Bus Depot - it should be Genuine Volkswagen. The seal I had on the bus before looks something like this:   
       --B
       --O
      ---D
 -   ----Y
--   ----side
 --------
 ----------
 ---------- 
      -----
 The one sent by Bus depot looks like this (smooth, kinda like a bullet but fatter):
    --
   ----

 Sorry for the rough drawings...My first attempt at ASCII art.

Will the one I ordered work ok? It doesn't seem to want to just fit in the groove and stay, so I want to be sure the one I got will work before I glue it in.
Also - any suggestions on which glue to use.

Thanks
Wink
