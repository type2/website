&gt;Volks,
&gt;   I have a really stupid question. Does the  #3 and #4 cooling flap
&gt;completely cover the oil cooler when the engine is hot? Where is flap when
&gt;the motor is cool? I have a '79 bus, FI. 

The flap is up when the motor is cool, down when it is hot.  It does cover the oil cooler completely, but air goes underneath the flap and through the oil cooler so it's not a bad thing.
