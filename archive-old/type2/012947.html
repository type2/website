Subject: child's cot for sale
To: type2_at_type2_dot_com

Mime-Version: 1.0

hello list. i have a child's cot for sale that is in IMMACULATE
condition.  per the library, it is:
&quot;2 piece, collapsible, 3 sided, galvanized = 76 - 79&quot;,
however, i did fit this into a '74 quite nicely &amp; i am not sure
as to what other years it will fit into.

i dont think it has ever been slept on.  i paid $50 for it,
&amp; would be happy if i could get $40 for it.

i would really prefer to sell this to someone at EveryBus
instead of shipping it.

pmail me if you are interested.

TIA
