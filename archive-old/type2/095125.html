Subject: Engine Identification?

Hello,

I recently purchased a 1972 van. I believe that the engine is not the 
original 1700. The reason being is that the oil dipstick sits on top of the 
engine (rather than out the back by the generator/alternator) to the right 
of the oil breather box. After a long search I found the engine number 
stamped diagonally on top of the engine by the bell housing. It starts with 
the letters &quot;EA&quot;.

Can anyone tell me if this is an original engine for my van?

Thanks, Phil.
