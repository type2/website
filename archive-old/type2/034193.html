Subject: RE: Auto in the bus

&gt; I'm no tranny expert, but far as i know, autos started in 73 in
&gt; the bus. Early ones came with a vacuum module that is undesirable for some
(buggy
&gt; runners, mainly) but works fine if the lines don't leak


Somewhere around 1978 the auto trans was changed to a later design, similar
to that used in a Rabbit.  Supposedly it is more reliable.  On the downside,
its repair is not covered at all in the Bentley manual (which covers the
earlier version, but sumarily dismisses the later version with a single
comment that it is similar to a Rabbit trans).  The front mount is different
and as I recall the linkage is on the other side of the trans.  Not sure how
easy it is to replace one with the other.  In my personal experience, I have
found the later ones to shift noticably better on average (but then again,
perhaps they were also typically a bit lower mileage, by virtue of being
slightly newer).  Simple parts like gasket kits are generally available.
However, there is much better availability of used and rebuilt manual
transmissions (as well as hard parts) than automatic ones. (In fact I don't
sell rebuilt auto transmissions at all.)  This is partially because the
automatics were somewhat rare in the U.S. (and almost completely nonexistent
elsewhere), thus resulting in a limited market for replacement parts as well
as a minimal number of junkyard donors.  My personal preference definately
goes toward the manual transmission, mainly because a 4 speed configuration
is (in my opinion) a better match for the slightly underpowered bus engine
than the automatic's 3 speed configuration.
