Subject: Re: [T2] 68 Westy brake fluid resevoir?? 

As you are finding out, the 68 system is one-year-only. Most all the uppers
are now crystallized and self-destruct when you touch them. You may want to
look for a 69 or 70 and get the upper, lower, and the tube connecting them.
You will need all 3 pieces. You will need to modify the upper mount.
These parts are more readily available but the material is the same. So pick a
good upper......


&gt; Hey all, well I am finally getting the old 68 back on the road, and
&gt; getting all those pesky little things out of the way, and now I am in
&gt; need of the master cylinder reservoir, has the threads on the bottom for
&gt; the line that goes to the master, and is kind of U shaped on the rear of
&gt; the reservoir to. if you happen to have one, please let me know what you
&gt; might want for it, it doesn't have to be brand new or anything, just
&gt; useable...thanks..Brian
