Subject: Re: [T2] Re: '72 distributor in a '68

From Larry Edson

I'd like to throw a curveball at this conversation. I have a '71 with an
 1898cc stroker with Kadrons and a 009. I'm very disappointed with the 009
 you've got me thinking about the SVDA. But what's the best way to add in a vacuum port with the Kadrons on 
there? There's a T leading from the brake booster to the vacuum ports on the carb manifolds. So is this as 
simple as adding another small T for the distributor? Are there good and bad places to do that?

 ----------------------------------------------------------------------

No, you cannot tap into manifold vacuum for vacuum advance. Vacuum advance needs ported vacuum. Ported vacuum 
comes from right above the throttle plate.

If I remember right, John C. does this on the Kadrons he sells. Not sure if he does it on carbs that have been 
installed. He offers to drill the hole on new throttle bodies:

AJ Sims does it: http://www.lowbugget_dot_com/kadron_labor.html
Scroll down to #105.
Not sure why he underlines the first 5 words......
&quot;We are the only ones that do this ......&quot;
I guess John does it wrong?
