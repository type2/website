Subject: Re: Fluke Multi-Meters repair? (hit by bus)

I have (had) an awesome fluke meter.  The dam thing did everything and it
was the prize piece in my tool collection.  I don't know what model it is
but it has all the buttons along the top and side.(about $500 I think)
Those things are really rugged but it just couldn't stand up to being run
over by my bus. don't ask. Everything still seems functional accept the
screen is wrecked.  anyone got a lead on how to fix em or where to get
parts? 
thanks. 
Ed.
