Subject: wanted,,a bay Westy

Volks,
    I received this request. Anyone out there want to sell? Contact Marty
direct.

&gt; Hi, Daniel- 
&gt; 
&gt; I saw your name on the Westfalia Owners' site; I hope you don't mind me
&gt; contacting you.
&gt; 
&gt; Have you ever thought about selling your '74 Camper?
&gt; 
&gt; The reason that I am asking...
&gt; 
&gt; After nearly 20 years of camping in friends' busses, I bought a really
&gt; nice Vanagon Westy this summer.  I LOVE the a/c, REAL heater, and
&gt; relatively smooth and powerful ride, but something is missing... (early
&gt; warning for impending midlife crisis?)  :-)  Anyway, I'm comtemplating
&gt; the idea of selling or trading my 1984 Westy for a 1970s era Bus Camper,
&gt; so I thought I'd drop you a note.
&gt; 
&gt; If you do consider selling it in the near future, please give me a call
&gt; or drop me a note.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks,
&gt; Marty Wallace, 1984 GL Wolfsberg Westfalia... &quot;Heisenberg&quot;
