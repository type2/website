Subject: Re: [T2] Silver socket wattage

What is this silver socket? Is this the German lighter socket? The one with
the green plastic ring around it? The one that cell phone plugs fall out of
and only the German lighter fits? They are useless. Most of today's lighter
plug powered accessory wires snap into the hole and retain somehwat. You
actually have to pull the item out. The silver socket doesn't retain- I was
sleeping in the back of my Vanagon Westy a few years ago, chatting to my
girlfriend on my cellphone. I bought an extra long wire for the cellphone
charger, but it still kept pulling out with even slight pressure. Quite a
pain when you're warmly ensconsed in your sleeping bag and that happens.
I've gotten rid of a couple of these things, they are easy to remove. I
replaced it with a standard lighter socket from Can Tire, for like $5. The
hole is the same size as I recall. I did this on a couple of buses,
including my 2 Vanagons. Tom

Subject: [T2] Silver socket wattage


Previously I wrote:

&gt; Does anyone know more about the silver socket in the Westfalia dash? I've
&gt; been trying to find out more about it for a while but only found one
person
&gt; mentioned on a website and I've been unable to contact him.

Thanks to everyone that replied. Does anyone remember how it's wired up
behind the dash? Where is it fused and how much wattage can it safely
handle?

BTW, the camper supplement doesn't show a 12v socket beside the circuit
breaker under the rear bench. My bus has this and I'm wondering if it's a
Canadian addition or if it was put in by a PO.
