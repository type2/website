Subject: Re: [T2] Saggy bottom

Richard,

I wonder if all the camping parts make it look that way...after all most 
of the cabinets and stuff are behind the front seats....

Look at this pic  http://www.shockwaverider_dot_com/newbus/picture-005.html

Of my 78 and compare the difference of where the lip is on the tire with 
yours.  Assuming that my stock size and rated tires are equivalent to what 
came on your bus....


I bet if I put 300 lbs of camping stuff in mine it would look saggy a 
little....as far as I know, mine has never been touched.

Cheers, dave

&gt; Does anyone think the rear end is sagging? The bus was so new it can't 
be so I wonder how many folks do the spring plate adjustment only to find it's in spec.
