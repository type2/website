Subject: tail lights/filler

Team, (CEO speak)

I think I'm gonna lay down for some aftermarket tail lights.

Looking over Richard's notes, I think I recall him(you) recommending the grey
(asian?) over the black (brazilian) version, correct?

I'm getting the clear lens ones off the auction site because they're the
cheapest, keeping stock lenses I already have though.

I have lens-bucket seals, need bucket-body seals.  Saw them at busboys.

I also have to smooth out my passenger side metalwork wrinkled by P.O.
I've straightened it out as much as I can with hammer/channelocks, so I'm
going to try to get it decently flat with some filler.

Any tips on the aftermarket lights/filler work appreciated.

Save the rants on bodywork for somebody who hasn't heard them all.

Thanks,

Billy
M'Boro, TN
