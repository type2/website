Subject: RE: [T2] distributor caused poor starting, fast idle and random
  loss of  power.....

Boston Bod does not like Pertonix-at least on auto trans busses like my 78.
He says they keep the advance plate from moving quickly enough to produce a
good launch.  On my in-process rebuild, I'm going to install a California
electronic ignition and see how that works.

Methinks the 75 bus hard starting, &quot;random loss of power&quot; and random
fast idle has been solved-daughter's bus has Pertronics, so such users
forget that a timing light is useful for other things- while playing
with the idle I noticed that while checking the RANGE of the advance
that it would go to max but not always come down, causing a faster idle
-and TAPPING on the distr body helped- ah-ha, centrifugal weights are
sticking?  Tried using a penetrant/lube under plate- NaDa, so I yanked
the distr and put in the spare points one from Ted Finemann's $5 parts
box (thanks Ted, been carrying that around for years) and lo and behold,
goes easily to 7 deg BTDC, idles fine on warm up and the milage jumped
back up to 22 mpg on her trip back to school.  It also helped that I
replaced the calipers- see add. post.

  I got some better light on the situation (actual light) this morning
and saw
  the distributor clamp was bent just enough that the dizzy was raised
up and
  the cam was disengaging. I fixed it by putting a washer under the hold
down
  clamp on the engine block.
