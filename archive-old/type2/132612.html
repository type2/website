&gt; yes, I have seen this. I have 2 sets of pertronix one in my 79 and one

&gt; though. no problems with the ignition. On my 79 I saw over 50 (IIRC
&gt; 53), this is a FI engine. I therorize that either my two units are
&gt; different or the FI is actually causing an error in measuring dwell.

Interesting.  I have a Pertronix and FI, and I see rock-solid 54 dwell.

Dave would have FI in his '78, too, right?  Seems odd to me that FI 
would be causing a dwell measurement error...?

Does your '66 have a vacuum advance distributor?  If not, then you 
probably do have different units (Pertronix has a model for 
centrifugal-only and a model for vacuum advance).  I dunno why the 
dwell angle would be different for the two, though.
