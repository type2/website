Quote from the '66-69 T1 Bentley manual page 50, sec 17.5:

&quot;In the 1500 engine from chassis 117 054 916 and engine HO 225 117, piston
(plunger) of oil pressure relief valve is modified. This version of piston
has annular groove, which allows oil to pass directly to the sump, relieving
pressure and lowering engine oil temperature.&quot;  And it does just that.
Think about flow, resistance, and time the oil spends in the cooler.  Better
regulated flow = better cooling.

The grooved piston was not used in stock dual RV cases, as the additional
second piston is more efficient at normalizing system pressure than the
single grooved piston system. However, I find that a dual RV case using FF
filtering maintains better pressure and temperature with the addition of the
grooved RV.  So stock case...no groovies needed.  FF filtering off the pump?
Got gauges?  Prove it to yourself.

I see that there is once again activity on the T2 list regarding oil
pressure relief valves.  Namely, recent postings by Russell and Stan
mention the role of a grooved piston.

Back in May, when I was rebuilding 1600 DP engines for my '71 Type 1 and
'71 Type  2, I was surprised to find that one engine had a grooved piston
and one without a groove, while neither piston on the other engine had a
groove.  Not knowing who rebuilt these before I bought them,  I needed
help.  I asked the T2 list and a T1 list and got several replies that
agreed with each other. The scoop was this:  If the case has a single
relief valve, the  piston has a groove. If the case has two relief valves,
neither piston has a groove.

I followed this advice and used only ungrooved pistons on the two rebuilds.

Do you all have any information that contradicts this?

Where does one go for the definitive answer on this.  The photos in Bentley
are, to my way of thinking, not conclusive.

Jack
