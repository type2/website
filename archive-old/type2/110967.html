Subject: RE: [T2] 76 transporter hydraulic lifters?

Cha,

i think folks are saying that the _pushrods_ for
hyd. lifters are supposed to be magnetic, not the
pushrod _tubes_.

&amp; of course, as someone else has already mentioned,
a PO could have swapped them out.

i think the only way is to go in &amp; verify for
yourself.

good luck,

not really sure...
i have some old pushrod tubes that came from
the bus that i could use to see if they are magnetic...
they are very light i remember and they felt
like maybe made from aluminum but without
going home and cleaning them up a bit and sticking
magnet to them i do not know..

these old tubes were replaced with new
pushrod tubes from the depot..
