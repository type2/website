Hey list when i saw the price for the delta coat heres what I did instead.
Its called Elastiseal I found it at Eagle Hardware, Ace, Home depot. It's a
rubberized roof coating that when it dries it coats any metal surface with
a rubberized coat. I just did my front floor this afternoon, nice and thick
coat and i did the inside of one door so far. It brushes on, was only $20 a
gallon. I think this will work for sound deadening as well as heat loss. I
also bought the Reflexix insulation and put it in the front of the bus
behind the foot panels which I'am replacing with birch plywood, as well as
the doors. Will let you know how it turns out.
