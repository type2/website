Subject: Re: 78t2 refer

My '79 Westy came with the Dometic fridge.  

I took it out - wasn't happy with the fact that it
drains the aux battery so quickly, takes seemingly
forever to cool down, doesn't really cool that well (I
camp in the desert alot), and won't run on propane. 
Of course I'm keeping the fridge around so it can be
restored to stock by me or any future owner (FO?).

The interior fridge cabinet and lids are still
intact/stock.  What I gained was a LOT of storage
space AND the fridge power/aux electrical panel can
now be used for other 12 volt goodies like a laptop
computer, or anything falling within the amp rating of
the aux system.  I'm currently at this stage and will
be hooking up the (former) fridge power wires to a
cigarette lighter jack, probably installed in the
control panel or some stealthy location nearby.

As for the refer, I picked up a portable Dometic
RC3000 - runs on AC/DC/Propane.  I bungee it behind
the passenger seat before leaving, and put it outside
when I arrive (or keep it put if I'm going stealth). 
I position the lid toward the front of the bus, and I
can access the fridge while driving - though I don't
condone multitasking behind the wheel.  I plan on
tapping into the Westy's propane system with a &quot;T&quot;
connection so I can run the fridge from the main
propane system while camping, rather than use those
small (non-recycleable afaik) propane containers.

btw, the new fridge rocks!  One small can of propane 
lasts anywhere from 1 1/2 to 3 days, depending on the
ambient temperature.  Kept nice and cool even during
Burning Man, which gets a wee bit warm.

Cheers,

- Randy
