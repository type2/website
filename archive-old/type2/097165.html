Subject: Re: [T2] Valve and Rod job... I think.

Don:

I sure as heck wouldn't drop the engine until I had a fairly good idea what
the problem - if any - actually is.  No power loss, no smoke, no oil
issues... offhand, this doesn't sound like an &quot;internal&quot; engine problem,
though, of course, it could be.  Open up the engine compartment, start up
the engine, and go back a listen to the engine.  Run the engine (gently) up
in RPM's and listen some more.  A rod knock has a &quot;deep&quot; clunking sound that
certainly will vary in tempo as the RPM's change.  If there *is* an
&quot;internal&quot; noise, try and generally locate it by moving your head around in
the engine compartment and determining where it's the loudest.  If it seems
to be coming from one of the heads, then check the valve adjustment on that
side.

If the PO put new heads in that should have cured any &quot;sunken&quot; or &quot;moving&quot;
seats at that time, though this kind of condition could develop again.

If you don't feel confident in your mechanical abilities and if you don't
have enough &quot;auto mechanic&quot; experience and knowledge, this might be a good
time to use some of your cache of cash and take the bus in to an experienced
VW shop for diagnosis.  If you *do* have a fairly major internal problem
(e.g., rod knock) then you can blow right by the $450 mark in a minute and
still not have a running engine.

Subject: [T2] Valve and Rod job... I think.



&gt; Last Thursday, when I was driving &quot;Bess the Bus&quot;, a sound from the engine
&gt; came forth.  It sounded like all a boulder was rumbling in the
&gt; engine.  Another way to describe it is, it sounded like a LOUD aluminum
can
&gt; be crushed in the engine.  I did not feel any loss of power and  at
&gt; mid-range RPM's the noise went away.  I opened up the Muir book to
&gt; investigate and it sounds like I am lucky I made it home.  I was only
about
&gt; 8 miles from home when I heard the noise.  BTW, when I got home there was
&gt; no black smoke or awful smell.
&gt;
&gt; On page 237 of my edition of the Muir book it states that I have &quot;rod
&gt; knock&quot;.  I called the Bus Boys today (BTW, I think they are very helpful,
&gt; Bus Depot too, just my two cents) and the gentleman guessed that it might
&gt; be a blown valve seat.  So I am in for my first engine pull I think.
&gt;
&gt; My question is, does anyone have any suggestions on what to look for?
&gt; While the engine is out, does anyone have any recommendations on what
&gt; should be replaced?
&gt;
&gt; I purchased Bess in Sept and she came with a library of receipts.  Looking
&gt; though them, Bess had new heads put in last year but the labor notes state
&gt; this &quot;intake valves are sunken into the head, seats feel tight but appear
&gt; to be moving in the head&quot;.  The $2900 repair bill states that the shop
&gt; replaced the heads but not the valve assemblies.  Does that sound
&gt; right?  Maybe this is the problem.
&gt;
&gt; I have about $450 dollars to start fixing Bess and pull the engine.  Can
&gt; anyone guess if that will be enough money?  I would hate to pull the
engine
&gt; and discover I am going to need more money then I have, I would rather
&gt; leave her in the garage until I raise the funds.
