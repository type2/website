Subject: Fuel pump and Oil cooler
To: Type 2 &lt;type2_at_type2_dot_com&gt;

Just got the news from my mechanic friend ( took it in
to get a fine tune). He said that the gas smell was
coming from a leaking fuel pump. And the oil leak was
so severe in about an hours time almost a quart leaked
into a bucket. Perhaps I need a new oil cooler. We're
taking it off to get a better look. Busdepot has both
parts - fuel pump for $149 and the cooler $119. Does
anyone have suggestions about cheaper options?
Many thanks!
