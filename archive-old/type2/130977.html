Subject: Jims VW Alabama - good builder?

http://www.jimsvw_dot_org/

*Warning thie site plays music!!!!*

Has anyone used &quot;Jim&quot; to build an engine/tranny? I want both of mine rebuilt 
but was hoping someone had some first hand experience from this bulder.

Could anyone recommend another builder in TN or a neighboring state that 
specializes in VW engines?

I looked into getting a brand new Mexi longblock but seems for the price of 
a new one I can get a decent rebuilt one plus a rebuilt tranny. And I'd love 
to save on shipping and use someone semi local, don't mind a good road trip. 
(Heard aircooled_dot_net didn't charge for new ones but emailed and it's $120)

Also thinking maybe this way I would be able to pull my engine/tranny and 
show up to builder and immediately give my cores avoiding the core charge in 
advance.

I really want to save up the cash and do engine/gas tank resto/tranny all at 
once.  Just looking for a stock 1600 dual.

Thanks in advance,

Daniel
