Subject: Hard to Crank.

Ok, it ran fine yesterday. Went out this morning to go, and it won't start.

It was cranking just fine, just no gusto/start. So I went and hooked up my
starter by-pass switch so I can crank it from the back and noticed that my
fuel return line was leaking BAD. Ooops, forgot to change that one when I
changed the rest, so I changed it. No biggie.

So after the lines have been leaking for who knows how long, and I haven't
noticed becouse my fuel sender was dead, my fuel supply was down to under a
gallon of gas. So I go to the Gas Station and get 5 gallons (dang, that's
HEAVY after walking a few blocks) and I fill it back up thinking it's out of
gas. But still the same thing. I turn the dizzy to vary-ing results. It
started a couple times but died out within like 20 seconds or so. No matter
what position the dizzy is in, so I'm not sure if it's a timing issue or not.

Anyway, after trying all that it feels like it's snagged on something. The
starter was spinning fine, then *WHUMFPHH* it hung up, and now it's being hard
to turn over. I can put voltage to it, and it turns like 1/4 of a crank, I
take off the voltage and in a couple seconds it finishes it's revolution.
Weird.

I don't know what to make of it. SOOooooo discouraging. :(  I have spark,
compression, and fuel. Oil's nice and full. I just put in 5 gallons of nice
fresh fuel.

I'm thinking that a partially plugged fuel filter might cause it to start up,
and then die out quickly. But what's with the hard cranking? And why does
messing with the timing get it to fire? Do Type 4's  have timing belts? Did a
search in the archive for &quot;timing belt&quot; and didn't find anything, so I'm
assuming they don't.

Any clues guys?
