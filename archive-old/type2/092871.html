Subject: Re: [T2] Urgent!  Your Opinion Please!

Rust, worn suspension, collision damage poorly repaired. Check the fit of 
the panels and doors. Check the brakes.

Really anything mechanical is easy - it is the rust and collision damage 
that is most difficult to repair for us non-body shop people.


&gt;Hiya List,
&gt;
&gt;I know that this is not THE forum for this question, but I do know that we
&gt;have knowledgeable people here.
&gt;
&gt;I am going to look at a '64 Safari in a couple of hours.  Now I can get
&gt;around a Baywindow pretty well and I know what to look for in general terms
&gt;when buying a used vehicle (read - Bus).  But Splitties and campers are a
&gt;whole new ballgame for me.  Is there anything particular to this vehicle I
&gt;should be looking for?  Any and all input is welcome.
&gt;
