Subject: Window Seal w/vent wing avail again!
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

After a very long period of complete unavailability, I've got about a dozen
of these seals coming next week!

This is the seal that fits the side window of a '68-79 bus that has a vent
wing in it. It works on the window in the sliding door, the window rear of
the sliding door, or the equivalent windows on the drivers side of the bus.
This seal is for the stationary glass portion of the window, not the vent
wing itself, so you will have to reuse the thick seal that goes around the
vent wing itself.  The seal for the vent wing itself will remain unavailable
for quite some time.

List member price is $24.95 each.  (I also have seals for the stationary
windows that don't have vent wings, or the sliding windows, for $19.95
each.)  Please call to order if you don't have an account with me; if you do
have an account set up you can e-mail or fax your order. While I do expect
to get more later, this initial supply will be first-come first-serve.

Thanks,
