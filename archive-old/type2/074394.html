&gt; That's one SMART idea... would be cool if you could have an electric one
&gt; of some sort so you wouldn't have to crawl under the car to turn it

who said anything about crawling under the bus??
&gt; 
&gt; But I think eventually I'm just going to do something with the EFI
&gt; system wired to a kill switch.. that's probably just as good and much
&gt; easier to do :)

hehehehehehe!

&gt; &gt; I like Bob's idea of a shut off valve, too.  Would be a painless theft
&gt; &gt; protection of a sort as well.
