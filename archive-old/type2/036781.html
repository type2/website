Subject: Its time to buy those Fiche readers from your VW dealer

As most of you are probably aware VWoA stopped supporting the old
MicroFiche setups and made every dealer go to to the parts computer
program.
This happened as of the end of last year.
The old MicroFiche readers are usually still there as backup, but
disappearing fast.
My local dealer put 2 in storage and after inquiering I could buy one of
them.
Its the one I always bought parts from at the parts counter. Many a high
price was quoted to me from it.
I got it with the turn-table, the complete Fiche drawer and the separate
Audi Fiche drawer.
All the Fiches are there, even the split screen Bus one, that I had
always been told they did not have.
So if anybody has always wanted one of those setups, now is the time.
These machines will disappear into nothingness fast, just like all the
old pre-1973 parts books.

Grab them while they are cold.
