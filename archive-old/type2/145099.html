&gt; Can shocks be changed without having a lift to get all the wheels off

Shocks are easy.  Just jack one wheel at a time, put a jackstand under
things for safety, and work away.

Do douse all the nuts with penetrating oil periodically for a few days
before trying to remove them.  They can get a bit rusty.
