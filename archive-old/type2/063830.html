&gt;After seeing some of the older model type IIs at the VW Jamboree in Costa
&gt;Mesa this weekend I had a question concerning license plates I hope someone
&gt;could answer.  I saw quite a few vehicles with the original (black on yellow)
&gt;California license plates.  Did these people just get increadibly lucky and
&gt;purchase their resto projects with the original plates?  Or is there a way to
&gt;go through the DMV to get the original plate re-issued?  It seems like
&gt;re-issuing original plates would be next to impossible but states do seem to
&gt;be printing different variety of plates these days and maybe that's a new
&gt;option I'm not aware of.

You can register your car with &quot;year of manufacture&quot; plates.  You get the
plates at a swap-meet or whatever, and take them to DMV to register your car
with them.  The plates have to be &quot;clear,&quot; meaning no car is registered to
them, you have to have a matching set, and they have to be from close to the
same year as your car.  The hard part is getting plates that are clear.
I've bought 2 sets of '51 plates, neither of which was clear.  I got a
refund on one set, the other was at a discounted price, so I took my
chances...  Even tho he swore they were clear and had come off of his
split-window bug.  Yeah, right - they were registered to a '78 Ford pickup!
It would do you well to get some type of enforceable guarantee...

Plate colors: (CA only)

'72 -&gt; 8? blue with yellow letters
'64-'72? black with yellow letters, narrow, registration sticker on upper
right corner of plate
'56-'63 yellow with black letters, narrow (normal) registration sticker 'til
'62, sticker holder above right corner of plate after that.
'51-'56 black with yellow letters, wide, registration on metal chip on lower
right corner, new chip every year
'47-'51 yellow with black letters, wide, registration tag on metal chip that
fits onto upper right corner of plate, new chip every year
'3?-'46 - I _think_ yellow with black, different font.  I think you got new
plates every year, at least in the early 30's
