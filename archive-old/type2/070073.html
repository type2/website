Subject: Re: Anyone want a domestic 'fridge? Question on points.

&gt;Anyone ever restored a Westy's dead 'fridge to function? I wonder 
&gt;if it's a simple matter of recharging the coolant or something. 
&gt;When I plug it in, lights come on and a faint hum is heard, the 
&gt;pipes in the cabinet behind the fridge get warm, but no cooling in 
&gt;the 'fridge occurs.

Repairing the '76-79 Westy fridge was covered on the old  
(combined) Vanagon list.  Perhaps it is in the archives.  

You should be aware that this fridge takes several HOURS to cool 
(and even then it does not cool very well, even when &quot;working&quot;).  
Mine took almost 8 hours to get cold. Are you giving it enough 
time?  Also, the bus must be level.  

You could try hitting the piping in various places with a hammer 
(firmly but not too hard); I have heard that this help.  The unit 
cannot be recharged, according to the manufacturer.  

You might also try calling Dometic, the manufacturer, at (800) 
544-4881 for more assistance.
