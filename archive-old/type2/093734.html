Subject: Re: [T2] Beetle advice (but a general electrical question)

Hiya Mick,

I'd be inclined to agree with Westy on this one.  Sounds like a relay with 
burnt contacts to me.  However if you need really top-notch advice on 
anything electrical in the VW world, drop by Speedy Jim's Website at 
http://www.nls_dot_net/mp/volks/
Jim has helped me (and countless others) through the VW electrical systems.  
He is a golden resource.
