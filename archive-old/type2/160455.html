Subject: True Story, was... Engine Smoking

Driving down the road and come up upon a pre 67 bus, smoking like 
crazy. Another 1/4 mile down the road and low and behold, fire begins 
to sneak out of the engine bay. Hit the throttle and pass and pull in 
front waving like crazy to pull them over. Took another half mile or 
so before they finally pulled over. By now it was a fire breathing 
dragon. I pull over in front and ran back and impressed upon the 
young girl driving, &quot;GET THE HECK OUT!!! YOU'RE ON FIRE!!!&quot; Got her 
out and away from the burning bus and consoled her. Not worth your 
life to save the bus. She told me she had just paid $500 for it and 
was driving home with her new purchase. It was fully engulfed by the 
time the fire department arrived. So, your smoking bus cannot yet 
compare, but likely would if you continue driving without pulling it 
apart and fixing the obvious signs of mayhem developing.
