Do add the cost of double the labor for two rebuilds as that motor 
won't last half as long as a stock T-IV done right. Not unless it's a 
Berg spec T-I, in which case it will cost more than a stock T-IV 
build. Add in some 3 to 5 MPG less mileage as well. The more you move 
from stock, the more you jepardize reliability and economy. As long 
as you can laugh it off as disposable income in the interest of 
experimentation and just having fun, it's not an issue.
