Subject: Steel Backed Main Bearings?

Volks;

My local FLAPS/Mechanic/Machinist is trying to sell me a set of steel
backed main bearings for my 1600 rebuild.  I did find reference to them
on the Gene Berg Technical Info web page.  What's the deal with these
things?  Are they VW parts or after-market?

TIA
