Subject: Re: [VB] never saw that before, never see again

iNsiDe the motor, behind the pump. this motor siezed. it was a bad leaker
[which is why it got traded it], and while the wholesale auctioneers moved
it to their site it went skreech. all the rod and the crank bearings are
dry fer-eyed. but the bunny looks great! has them two dots for eyes, and
the upturned one-lined mouth. looks like something from a gumball machine.

&gt;inside the motor, or between pump and moustache bar? if inside, i think yo
&gt;found the cause of death!
