Subject: front tire / bike carrier

I need to carry a couple more kids bikes on the bus.
'74 westie with the spare tire on the front.
I have a bike rack for the back and was wondering if
the front bracket would put too much stress on the sheet
metal on the front holding the tire in place.

Any one with thoughts or experience with this?
Thanks
James
