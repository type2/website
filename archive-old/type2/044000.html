Subject: [T2] Need to ship '73 Panel from NY to STL

I bought a European '73 panel off the net and need to get it from Long Island 
to St. Louis.

I believe it is drivable with recent tune up and new fuel lines.  The brakes 
and tires have also recently been replaced.  I would fly up and drive it back 
myself, but I think towing or a car hauler may be my best option, since I 
can't afford the time away from the office if I were to break down along the 
way.

I would like to get this done as reasonably as possible.  I would pay up to 
$600 to have it delivered by a car hauler.  If anyone knows of a reasonable, 
reliable service, please pmail me.

Thanks,

Steve Lashley
