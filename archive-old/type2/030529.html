Well,

I would say a mature outlook would be preferable to any safety device
available on the market. If the boy doesnt have a mature enough
outlook to pilot an unsafe car mindfully, then perhaps he shouldnt be
encouraged to drive all over the country in any kind of car at that
age. (no specific commentary on anyones specific teengaer, just going by
what i've seen them acting like behind the wheel around here..)

Judging by you doing all the buildup work on the van, i'd say to involve
him in working on the van and getting it ready.  If he isnt mature enough
to help get the vehicle ready for his trip and at least try to learn how
to work on it, then he probably isnt mature enough to handle the trip, in
any sort of vehicle.

Just MHO,

Steve
