Subject: 1700 valve adjustment

Ok so im here really to admit that i am not mechanically gifted. But here is 
the situation. I have a 72 westy with a 1700 pancake in it. Following muirs 
procedures I have tried to adjust the valves but it doesnt make sense. I 
dont have and marks on my crankshaft pulley and when i turn my alternator 
with a wrench my crankshaft does NOt turn. I have tried to tighted it up but 
it still does not good. The Belt is not too loose (about 1\2 inch 
deflection)(I think that muir said something around that number). That is 
also about as tight as i can get the belt. I am thinking that it might be 
time for a new belt. Am i right?? And then when i do get the belt could 
someone tell me if i have it right? I turn the alternator and watch the 
rotor and when it gets to the little mark on the distributor then Its at the 
firing position for #1 right?? Then i can just go 180* to do the next valve 
and so on. Sorry if the question is too lenghty or if you guys are laughing 
because you all think that this is such an easy thing but i just want to 
figure it out and know how to do it myself so i dont have to depend on 
someone else to take care of MY car. Thanks again
