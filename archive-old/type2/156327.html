&gt; Search google for Wurth DP300.

Or go to your local BMW motorcycle (or possibly car) dealer.

Apparently, Permatex was buying hylomar from the manufacturer and
packaging it themselves.  The manufacturer tried to force a major price
increase on Permatex and that is why Permatex stopped carrying the product
in their line.

If you check the hylomar_dot_com site you will find the following:

-----------------------------------------
For anyone worrying about getting their Hylomar since Permatex stopped
carrying .Hylomar HPF. - Worry no more! We have huge stocks of Racing
formula, and Universal Blue AF( sic. HPF ) in stock around the world if
you can't find it at your nearest stockist just e-mail  info_at_hylomar_dot_com
and give us their contact details and we will show them the error of their
ways or find  a stockist near you who is carrying Hylomar!
----------------------------------------

Production has certainly not stopped, but the price has most likely gone
up!  Still, at the rate I use it I don't think that I'll have to choose
between food and Hylomar.
