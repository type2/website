	I picked up a '71 1600 transporter tonight and took my kids for a ride up
and down the road in it.  It ran great.  Has a couple of small cracks in
windshield.  Any good source for new windshield glass and seals?

	Also, am selling a '65 Alfa Romeo Ti sedan and a '76 Alfetta sedan - so
let you Italian friends know.  Cars located in Central New Hampshire.
