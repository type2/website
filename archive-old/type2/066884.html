Subject: Re: heat cont.

&gt;&gt;bits of plastic in bins... So I bought about 5 yards of the stuff - I
&gt;&gt;always buy too much material - some grommets and some of those stick-on
&gt;&gt;hooks. Today is going to be 'design the partition' day.

I had a similar day, except I was searching around an Oshkosh Menards...
anyway, snagged loads of 2&quot; insulation for $2.  Its a bit dirty, but I
'spose it still keeps heat in an cold out...  Bought an 8x6 tarp that I'm
going to cut and velcro to the ceiling and to the bottom of the backs of
the two front seats.  Going to cut a hole to see out of through for rear
view mirror and put something there (haven't found what yet- maybe I should
take a trip to NYC) and a nice little flap that velcros on and off for
access to the back.  The tarp is blue so its going to feel a little bit
crampy I think, but the nice blue glow those tarps give off is pretty
soothing...

I'll get back to the list when I actually insulate the doors and try to
velcro this thing to the ceiling...
