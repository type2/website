Subject: Re: [T2] generator light....



&gt; 
&gt; Hey,
&gt; 
&gt; I have put new generator brushes in the top part of my generator 
about 2 
&gt; weeks ago.  That stopped the generator light from going on.  Then it 
started 
&gt; to come back on three days ago.  I put in new bottom generator 
brushes.  the 
&gt; springs seem to be pretty tight. and the generator light went out 
again. so 
&gt; yesterday I was christmas shopping and the generator light went on 
again.  
&gt; High revs would not bring it off.
&gt; 
&gt; I checked the brushes and they are almost warn down already.

I had precisely the same experience.  The commutator (the metal strips 
that the brushes bear against) is toast.  This is caused by the arcing 
of the brushes after they lose contact with the commutator.  You will 
see that it is blackened and pitted where it should be smooth and 
copper-colored.  This wears the brushes rapidly.  The solution is to 
turn the commutator on a lathe, a process that is part of a good 
generator rebuild.

The only cure is a rebuilt generator or alternator conversion.  I did 
the alternator route and am very happy with the results.  Be aware 
that if you have a '71 with original generator you will have to get a 
new fan hub for the alternator, along with the alternator stand and 
tin.  More on this can be found in the archives.

For those running generators, this should be a cautionary tale to 
replace the brushes as soon as they are even with the top of the metal 
brush holders.  If you don't the same thing can happen to you.  Also, 
don't assume that the top brush and the bottom brush wear at the same 
rate.  Murphy's law is at work here!
