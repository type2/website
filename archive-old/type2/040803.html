Hey Isaiah,
   What to get Stella for the anniversary depends on her personality.
If she is a practical gal, maybe a new ice scraper (winter isn't that far 
away), romantic, a cruise together to watch the sun set.  If she's a fun one 
a good rubdown with a wash brush is always nice.  If she's a little more 
vain than that, throw in some touch-up paint and wax.  The possibilities are 
endless.
   Now if I could only think of something for the anniversary with my wife 
that will happen later this summer!

Enjoy the summer season everyone
