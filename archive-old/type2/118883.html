Subject: Re: [T2] '69 and a '71 bus comparison !

From: Robert Carpenter
 
&gt; I like the '71 for its disc brakes, are there any one year only items?
 
You mentioned the 70 one-year-only fuse box...... well, the 71 is also....and the 72....
The 70 was # 411 937 505A, the 71 is 411 937 505B, and the 72 is 411 937 505C.
But only the early production 70 had the yellow 'split down the middle' fuse box. I have 
not seen any of the white ones go bad. [and if you wondered what about fusebox D and E,
D was 73 411 and E was 74 412].

The 71 was the only USA bus that came with the dual port and doghouse oil cooler.

The 71 air cleaner is one-year-only, it is thermostatically controlled instead of cable.
