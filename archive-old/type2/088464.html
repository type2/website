Subject: Lugless engine into Bus

Hi all, I was wondering if there is some way to put one of these engines =
without the mounting lugs molded into its rear into the bus.  I have =
managed to get not one but two rebuilt examples of these. I put one in =
there and it wasn't until I grabbed the cross member to install it that =
I realized what I'd done.  Boy is that ever a heartbreaker, it fit right =
in there just right too.  I think maybe if I get the mounting pieces =
from whatever VW this came out of and chop them up then maybe I can weld =
soemthing together to make it all work.  Glen Ward
