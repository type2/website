I'm thinking a Barndoor, slammed to the pavement in the front, sporting a 
Big Block Chevy in the rear. Of course I'd have to cut away most of the 
firewall to get that monster V-8 in place, but no matter. I'd also cut out 
the wheel wells and stuff in some huge, raised letter tires mounted on 
shiny, chrome mag wheels. For paint, I'm thinking some sano flames would do 
the job, perhaps over a base of metal flake purple. Next, I'd glue shag 
carpet all over the interior, mount a TV-VCR combo in the back, and make 
EVERY  window in the thing a Safari. Finally, I think I'll cut holes in the 
side for some bitchin' headers.
Whadya think?
