Subject: Re: [T2] firing order




&gt;
&gt; &gt; firing order is 1-4-3-2 right (it says right on the gen. stand)
&gt; &gt; so the spark plug wires go on the dizzy in this order? if i put mine 
&gt;1-2-3-4
&gt;
yes but you have to start in the right place.
&gt;
&gt; &gt; it starts and runs but no power(see previous post) if i leave the timing 
&gt;the
&gt; &gt; same (5 1/2 deg. btdc)
&gt;
&gt;then when it is running hook up a timing light and set it correctly, you
&gt;really can not get it set statically I don't care what Muir says.

i have done it

&gt;find top dead center of cyl #1 manually.  (take out spark plug and remove
&gt;valve cover, get the TDC by feeling into the spark plug hole with a small
&gt;piece of wood dowel while turning the crank by hand until you feel it at
&gt;the top,

did this too....

&gt;when you are at top dead center on #1, rotate the dist until the rotor
&gt;lines up with the #1 plug wire.  then put the rest on clockwise 4-3-2 and
&gt;you should have em right.
if you still have no power I would look elsewhere for the problem

have re re cheacked the valve clearence....
checked the points,carb,clutch and everything else i can think of. had a 
friend check all the stuff he could think of. just cant figure why it runs 
with the plug wires on wrong and wont even start with them in the correct 
order.
