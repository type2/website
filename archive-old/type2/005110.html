well my 1975 mystery camper (janis) got back from the mechanic on friday and
it sounds like an angel.  my dad drove it home and we got it tagged titled
and gassed up in only two hours.  then it was to the closest secluded spot
for some lessons on driving a  manual transmission.  it was rough at first
but eventually i got the hang of it. i am only 15 and looking at another bus
but this one is very rough and may be beyond me.  well i just thought i
would let everyone know that this kid is on the road now so look out. just
kidding.
