&gt;
&gt; Regarding the windshield, Safelite Auto Glass (a national franchise chain)
&gt; runs bus windshields for about $99 installed in many regions, excluding the
&gt; seal.  Remove your old windshield, do the rust repair, order one of my
&gt; seals, and pay them $99 to do the rest.  That way, if they break it putting
&gt; it in (which they seem to do about 1 out of 5 times, in my experience) it's
&gt; their problem not yours. Besides you'd probably pay close to the $99 for a
&gt; used junkyard windshield anyway.

 
I agree 101% I bought the seal (Safelite wanted $50 for the seal, with or
without chrome) from Ron, then had them do the glass after I did all
of the rust repair on the window frame. They had to do it 4 times
with two different windshields before they got it leak free. The final
time one guy spent almost 4 hours working on it. Well worth the money.
In fact, the first glass they put in wasn't right, so when he put the second
glass in, he let me keep the first. (And I gave it to a  list member gratis!)

I must caution you that doing rust repair on the windshield is not for the
faint of heart. Without a flat spot in sight, every edge has curves in at
least
two directions. It became a 'weld on metal, grind 90% of it back off, weld
on some more, grind most of it off' to get the profiles right and the metal
solid again. I cheated in some places and used fiberglass resin to fill
some pin holes and minor indentations. 

Now, I just have to attack the other 12 windows in the bus!
