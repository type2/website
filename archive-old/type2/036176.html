Subject: &quot;oh my aching back!&quot;...tire pressures?

We all know that our loafs are not the most comfortable riding vehicles on 
long trips, but we persevere for their other satisfactions. And I accept the 
need for reinforced side wall C-rated tires, having indeed replaced my 
original but wornout Michelin R's with another set.
But in the discussion of the tire question in the Library and Archives, I 
have found no technical information as to how to set the pressures at a 
level which will be both safe and as comfortable as possible. My side-seat 
driver complains bitterly of the ride for long trips on the interstate.
So I am contemplating dropping the pressures to 24 front/ 32 rear after 
examing the maximum load rating capacities at these pressures and concluding 
that there is sufficient margin of safety for these values. Further, I 
observed that the center of the tread wears more rapidly than the outsides 
when observing the recommended 30/40 pressures.
Does any one have experience with such reduced pressure levels? One needs of 
course to take into account cargo weight, but for an empty vehicle save for 
the passengers and a suitcase or two, wouldn't something less than 30/40 be 
o.k.?  Or, has anyone found a magic shock absorber or seat that will take 
the sting out of the ride?
