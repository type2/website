Subject: Re: [T2] Dule carb to single Good or Bad idea?

Hello,

I guess my first question is, why do you want to
change carb setups? Is this the stock carb setup? Is
your bus just not running well? If that is the case,
make sure you rule out every probable cause before you
replace your carbs. One problem that I can think of
right off hand is that these single carb setups can be
prone to carb icing due to the lack of pre heating. 
Seeing that you live in Ontario, Canada, this would be
a concern. You would probably have a hard time
starting your bus on cold mornings. 

If you are looking to change your stock carb setup,
there are nice dual carb replacements that you can
get. I have no experience with them though I am sure
other list members do. Check out the archives at
type2_dot_com for &quot;progressive carburetor&quot;. You should
find a wealth of info about using these carb units.

Good Luck!

Have a great day!
