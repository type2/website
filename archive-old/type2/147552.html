Subject: Testing the Voltage Regulator

Generator light in a 75'.   Dead battery now because I guess it wasn't
charging properly.

figured I would check the easy stuff first like the voltage regulator.

PO installed what looks to be a fairly new  Bosch 0-192-062-007 VR.

using the Ratwell site I took out my handy Fluke 73.

Ratwell says:

# D+ and DF - 0.3 ohms
# D- an DF - open
# D- and D+ - 80 ohms


Mine says

# D+ and DF - 1.93 M ohms
# D- an DF - 1.93  M ohms
# D- and D+ - 5.43 k ohms


So this means either my VR is WAY bad, or you can't test an electronical
one this way.

If the latter is the case how can I rule out my VR as the source of my
electrical woes without blowing 40+ bucks?

Incedentally the electronical one I pulled looks practically new.(mayhaps
the PO tried this already??)

I'd like to rule out the VR also before I pull the ALT as I have heard
tales of the misery that is involved in said process without pulling the
engine(they may have been exagerated though)

Hopefully the gurus of the Type2 List can save me!

I did try searching on the list for Voltage Regulator Test or testing
voltage regulator(an various permutaions thereof) but didn't find any
really good answers.

thanks in advance

-Zach
