Subject: [T2] VWoA locally is full of it, IMHO

Around here (western Wisconsin and the Minneapolis-St.
Paul areas of Minnesota), the VW dealers are helpful
to the extent of offering their sales lots for VW car
shows in the summer, and their inside shop space for a
winter parts swap.  Without the dealers, the ACVW
owners would be hard-pressed to find a good place to
have these activities.  
Maybe it won't happen this year??
