Hey All...
  I got a '79 2000 engine in my bus with a fuel injection system. There has
never been a problem with it till the other day. I started it cold, and it ran
perfectly normal for about ten seconds or so. After that it gracefully shut
off. I went and turned it and turned it and turned it more. Only after rapidly
pumping the gas would it fire for about a half a second. I went outback and
fiddled with all the little connections that my fingers could handle on this
freezin cold night, and when i got back in, it fired up and i immediatly held
it at real high rpm's till i was sure it was runnin. i let go, and it warmed
up normal, and hasnt fussed yet. I've ruled out pretty much all other things
except the FI system, and dread the thought of messin with all that electrical
crap. 
      I guess i'm just wonderin if anybody has had any similar experiances,
and what they did in my situation. I have been wanting to look into switchin
to carburation, but never had a real excuse. I now feel that i have one.
Anybody know about what a conversion kit runs and who makes a good one?  Or
can i get the carb, manifold, and stuff off of a parts van to add on to mine?
Maybe i'll just have the kit ready to put on till something truly goes wrong.
I cant afford to have too much down time. 

Thanks...
   Matt O.
