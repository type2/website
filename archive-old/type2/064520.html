Re: your own work -- It's the only basis on which I can afford to enjoy
German cars.  I admire, without wanting to emulate, those who choose
these old busses as their &quot;gotta run on Monday&quot; cars.  Even when I can
put in the time to do the job myself, I can't put it in on a schedule,
so I have to have the Japanese cars that are useful, and affordable, on
a non-hobby basis.  And as John vwbus points out, even doing your own
work is not going to make old busses sensible in terms of return on
investment.
