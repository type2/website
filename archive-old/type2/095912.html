Looking for left and right vanagon vent windows with =

grail?  Every van I look at in the wrecking yard the frames are rusted =
thru, same as mine.

Please pmail if you have one or both in solid shape.  I can trade other =
vanagon or aircooled stuff ( I have several good alternators) or =
reasonable price............
