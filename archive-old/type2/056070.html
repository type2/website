Complete minus original rear seat.  Mostly strait except for a few dings.
Minor rust in one rocker and in cab floors.  Original, good shape rear round
hella tail lights and bullet turn signals.  Strait gates and bed, no rust. Has
original front bumper and non original rear hitch bumper.   PO says engine was
rebuilt, but it was out of truck due to new muffler/header he was going to
install.  It is a roller.  Ran before engine taken out.  Parcel tray is
detached and speedo removed, but there.  Was going to install new speedo
cable.  Wheel wells uncut.  Period rims.   Online pics will be available 7/10
(fri).  Email for contact and particular info.  Can take video stills and send
of any part of truck you wish.  $2500 or $3000 running and driving.  Has CA
title and under non-op.  Lots of reciepts from PO.  Was a FBI sting vehicle??
in San Fran before PO purchased it in the mid 80's.  Had a kewl yellow paint
job that is worn.  I believe it was converted to 12v.  There is a converter so
some components must be 6v still.  Delivery may be avail. in N. Cal.  Located
in Redding, CA (northern cal).
