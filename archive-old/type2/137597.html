Subject: Re: [T2] Depressing afternoon working on the bus...

One thing that has worked wonders for me in the past on both bus and beetle 
is to take off the wiper arms and the plastic covers. Then I built up a 
&quot;dam&quot; around each wiper with play-doh. Or, you can jam some fuel hose down 
over the wiper arm, 1/2 inch works well I think. (Not VW size, it is too 
small) Fill with gear oil and let sit for an hour or two to let it work 
down inside the bushings. Turn in wipers (no arms attached) to work it in 
there and let it sit some more. It has always been my experience that the 
bushings on the wiper arms are the worst part of the system. I have never 
had the linkage or motor bind. Of course, YMMV but it has worked for me.

&gt;  place? Like for example spraying white grease spray up from below or into
&gt;  the shafts from outside? Or is it only a remove and dissassemble deal?
