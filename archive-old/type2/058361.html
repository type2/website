Subject: Replacing battery cables

    It's not a bad job but it can get a little dirty if your engine's
not the cleanest. You'll do some wiggling under the beast to get at the
solenoid connection. But anyway...
    My two cents; take the time to correctly reinstall the rubber
grommet on the cable where it passes through the firewall. If you don't
the cable can chafe through on the metal edge and short your battery to
ground. Directly to ground. This is a bad thing.
