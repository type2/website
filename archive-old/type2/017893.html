  &gt;3. Someone should run a compression test on this thing. With new rings, 
the p&amp;c's couldn't be any worse than before. I think
  &gt;they've got something screwed up. The compression test should at least 
piont to whether it's inside or outside. 

I absolutely concur.  The compression test will tell all.  I wouldn't worry 
about re-using the old pistons and cylinders unless they
were really worn (and I've never seen a really worn set).  I would probably 
have re-used the rings too.  I know they seem like a
wear item, but if you were not burning oil and your compression was strong 
and even then they were probably okay. If you
replaced the rings without honing the cylinders, that could easily be your 
problem.  The rings and cylinders sort of wear into
each other to make a good seal.  New rings with &quot;old&quot; cylinders will mess 
that relationship up.

I third the compression test idea. I bought a head from Mark stephens on a 
recent type 4 rebuild because I had 90 pounds on 
one side, $250 on a head and the best they could give me was a raise to 100 
pounds. Pretty weak in my opinion. I would have
dedicated all my available funds toward new bearings, pistons, cylinders and 
rings, then tried to reuse the heads
maybe attempted to fix the crack. everyone will have a different opinion 
though. take the compression, if any are under 100, pull
the motor.
