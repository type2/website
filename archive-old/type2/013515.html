Greetings Amigos, I am still hoping to get off on my 2
month adventure tomorrow but as of now I am dealing
with a fuel pump problem. You see, I installed a
second hand pump in this morning as well a new filter.
When I tried to start her up it ran the gas out of the
line between the pump and the injectors then stopped.
is it necessary to prime the pump? Is there something
I am missin here? Thanks,
davooo
