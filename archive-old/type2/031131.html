&gt; As it will probably take me a week or more (damn those torque converter

I loosen the engine and pull it back about a half inch so there is a small
gap between the engine and tranny, then go into that gap with a flat bike
wrench, 13mm (about $5 at a bike shop)  I work from under the engine and
with a good drop light you can actually see what you are doing.

 I have put em back on that way too, but that is much harder. especially
the first one. (read a good pair of forceps!)

be carefull when pulling the engine the torque converter sometimes wants
to follow the engine out and will fall to the ground, with not good
results. (ask me how I know?)


don't lose those bolts they are unique to the torque converter. (anyone
have some spares??)

&gt; i've got some time and would greatly appreciate the imput of anyone willing
&gt; to take the time.

I don't really have much time at the moment, I am getting married Sun, and
will be off line for about 2 weeks
