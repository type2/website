&gt;But that site is so slick!  It must be legit!  :)
&gt;
&gt;I especially like the &quot;Tech Tips&quot; link that takes you to an advertisement
&gt;for a subscription &quot;online manual&quot; service run by AutoZone.  I &quot;expect&quot;
&gt;that there's lots of aircooled data there!

This site isn't so bad.  I found some great Diesel Injector hose for my 1973 TypeII.  They have a nice assortment available - three different kinds from $41 to $58.  I'm excited because I haven't been able to find this stuff on any other aircooled parts web site.

p.s. In case anyone
was wondering, I'm
joking!  That site
sucks!  :)
