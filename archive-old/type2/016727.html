Subject: Question on table &amp; straps

New (to me) 77 Westie automatic now in the fleet brings some strange
questions to the fore....

Have an original table with the fold-up section....where does everyone
put it when not in use...it gets in the way of the bed....and at 5' 11
we need all the room we can get...&lt;GRIN&gt;

On the back lower corner of the rear cupboard (next to the cushion) is a
strap...what does it attach to/hold in place??...it's hidden for the
most part by the cushion...

Also looking for 5 black curtain straps/snaps....does anyone have any
spares kicking around??

Good bussing all...Den
