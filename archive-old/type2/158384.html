Subject: AC/DC setup for an AC only fridge

Ok.. here's the sitch.

I bought a standard fridge froms Lowes, and put it in the van.  I
have an AC convert hooked up to it on a switch so that I can run it
off the batteries.  this works great.

I am in the process of putting the AC (shore power) in, and I'd like
to have the AC or DC option the fridge.

SO......

If the switch is on, I want it to draw from DC....  if i plug in the
AC, i want it to automatically cut off the DC and on the AC..

The current plan involves 1 duplex outlet fed by the AC converter.
there will be an HD solenoid between the converter and the outlet.
Then..  i have the AC hooked to the same outlet, and when it gets
&quot;hot&quot; it will cut off the solenoid  between the outlet and the
converter so that the power wont seep backwards.

thoughts?
