Subject: [T2] March, April campouts

Not an overwhelming response to my invitation to come a-camping with me at Cape San Blas, FL next week.  Gotta start showering more often.  Forecast says 
rainy Sunday then clearing and colder - possible lows in 30s, which is quite a change from the unseasonably warm temps we've had lately.  I've stocked up on 
firewood.  As a reminder I plan to arrive this Sunday and stay until Thursday.  With luck the cold weather will cut down on the crowds.  I should be nice and cozy 
inside the '71 Westy.  Remote, dunes, surf -- it'll be great, whatever the weather.

I'd also like to suggest any camping folks who are going to Busses at the Beach / VWs at the Seaside in Jax Beach April 21/22 should consider Kathryn Abbey 
Hanna Park (http://www.coj_dot_net/fun/hanna1.htm), just 10-15 minutes away from the show site.  I camped there last year and really enjoyed it.  From what I hear it 
was a lot more peaceful than camping at the show lot.  With luck this year we won't get the Arctic Blast in the middle of the weekend.  I'll be coming in Friday and 
leaving Sunday after the show (show info at the www.sevwc_dot_com event planner).  If I can get far enough along on it, I hope to bring my '65 Neunsitzer / 
selbstgemachter Wohnmobil ;-), else I'll be in the '71.
