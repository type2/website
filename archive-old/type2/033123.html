Dear List Members,

We had a great time this evening! Dave and Diane Burden suggested that
we meet at a famous local drive-in called the Varsity at Town Center
Mall. The Varsity at North Ave. in downtown Atlanta has been a well
loved local wateringhole since the thirties and was featured in media
coverage of the summer Olympics of '96.

My boyfriend, Eddy, Dave and Diane and their children, Anthony and
Samantha (who named their bus &quot;Daisy&quot;) met with Garey Simpson and his
son Garey, Jr. and his daughter, Katy and I for the &quot;Big Event&quot;. There
were three buses lined up in front of the restaurant, my '78 passenger
van, Gus, the Burden's '72 passenger van, Daisy and the Simpson's '76
passenger van, Big Orange who is no stranger to the country's best
surfing beaches. Loafs were well represented!

The Burdens added a &quot;Woodstock&quot; (Snoopy's bird friend) card so that all
other citizens of towns called Woodstock could sign it (great idea!) and
a &quot;Woodstock&quot; key chain! Garey Simpson donated a highly necessary
frisbee and flashlight and a less necessary but ornamental Varsity
counterperson hat (whaddalyahave, whaddalyahave!!?!). More on my
donation later! 

Whoever donated the &quot;Small Wonder&quot; book is a neat, sweet person! That is
a wonderful book! The maps, phone card and the NEATO TTT list are great
ideas too 

I will be in touch with Joy McMahan and we will update you on that.

Chris and Gus in Atlanta
