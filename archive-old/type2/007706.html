&gt; George,
&gt; Wait a minute.... You mean to tell me you set your valves every 2000
miles?
&gt; Why?
&gt; Even VW never required that... At most maybe 4000 or 5000 if they
were in
&gt; need....
&gt; but recommended at 6000 or every other oil change.
&gt; Is there a reason why you would need to set them so frequently?

My normal use of the bus is for short trips, so the miles don't go on
very fast.  2000 mile oil changes are a bit more often than the
recommended 3000 mile intervals.

I do a valve adjustment with each oil change since my hands are
already oily and I like to keep tabs on the health of the top end.  If
one of the valves starts to lose its clearance repeatedly then I know
that the head needs attention, hopefully before something breaks loose
and trashes the pistons.

Yes, you can get by with less frequent valve clearance checks, but
more frequent won't hurt anything.
