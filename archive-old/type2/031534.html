wanna go power, the big Corvairs provide 110, 140, 165 HP for a lot less
money and work, and the torque ranges are closer.

but I have done mine pretty close to a stock 2 liter, cost me about $2,500
for the whole job, I let a machinist do the bottom end, I did the top, it
was done compromise style, 1 gram balance on bottom end, cleaned and
smoothed the heads but not polished etc.

one hint, USE diesel valve seats they handle the extra heat better.
