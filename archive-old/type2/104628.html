Subject: Timing help

Hello all,

I'd like some help timing my 1970/1971 Westfalia. The issue is that the
chassis number indicates that the vehicle is a 1970 (2302128146), whereas
the engine code is for a 1971 motor (AE000404X). There are 3 timing marks
on the crankshaft pulley similar to the original 1970 pulley. Additionally,
the carburetor seems to be the original model (30 PICT-3) . As for the
distributor, I can find no distinguishing markings to indicate the type
other than &quot;Bosch made in Germany&quot;.

With this information, should I be setting the timing at TDC vacuum hose
disconnected and plugged (as for a 1970) or 5 degrees ATDC vacuum hose
connected (as for the 1971 engine)?

Thanks for help!


Asaph
