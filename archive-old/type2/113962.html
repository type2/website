&gt;shocks have *nothing* to do with ride height.

Can't agree with you 100% Joel.  When I swapped out my dead rear shocks for KYB Gas-Adjusts a few years ago, the rear of the bus did come up a little.  I think it was 1/2&quot;, or about half the amount that the Monroe coilover shocks raised it.  Oil filled shocks will not affect ride height but gas charged shocks do have a bit of lift associated with them.  And 1/2&quot; is more than you think.
