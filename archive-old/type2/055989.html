Hello All:

I was wondering if it is possible to use the sump plate
from a Porsche 914 on a type IV bus engine ?????

The Porsche sump plate is pre-drilled with an indentation
for the sender.

AVP sent me a sump plate and said so long as the sender
was the correct size it should work fine.

Anyone ever used one of these ??

Any reason I couldn't ?? shouldn't ??

Thanks in advance!

Rob
