Subject: Re: Rivieras... better or worse than Westys?

I love, I love, I love my Riviera!   Now I can't say that I own a Westy to
compare it to, but I can say that my Riviera comfortably sleeps all five of
us on camping trips and gets us everywhere we want to go as our daily
driver.  As far as collectability, isn't it usually that the fewer of
something produced equals the more collectable it is?  There are far fewer
Rivieras rolling around the nations highways than Westy's.  Again, I'm not
knocking the Westies.... in fact, I imagine I will own one sooner or
later... but I wouldn't trade the top bunk in my Riviera for anything.

Keep on bussin'...    and kampin'...... in whatever you own!
