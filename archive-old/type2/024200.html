Subject: Re: Rear Brake Adjustment SNAFU
Message-ID: &lt;7b0083fa.24be8058_at_aol_dot_com&gt;

 &gt;I managed to actually BREAK off the end of my large &quot;heavy-duty&quot; 
 &gt;Craftsman screwdriver while trying to turn one of the stubborn 
 &gt;adjustment stars --  and the last half-inch or so of the driver blade
 &gt;fell inside the brake drum through the adjustment hole, and remains 
 &gt;there. Typical gotcha, for me.  I don't know how far down inside it
 
 As you've already heard, you really need get the piece out of there.  At
 best, it'll damage the drum and I suppose it could actually interfere with
 the operation of the brake.  
 
 Pulling drums off of a 79 shouldn't be too bad.  Just remove the wheel/tire
 and then remove the 2 (11mm?) bolts from the surface of the drum.  After
 you've got the drum off (it may require a little coaxing and if possible,
 you may want to back the adjusters a bit), pull the adjuster stars out of
 their bores and clean them up real nice and smear a little grease on them
 before putting them back in (don't leave any excess grease though).  
 
 Good luck.

If you broke the tip off the screwdriver it is probably because the stars 
were frozen.  I just went through the process of pulling my drums and freeing 
the stars.  Pulling the drums can be a hassle.  After removing the two bolts 
that hold the drums on they might not want to slip right off.  You might need 
to spray some GM heat valve lubricant (available at any GM parts source) or 
other rust breaker (again don't bother with WD 40, etc.) on the drums at the 
points where it connects to the axle.  I had to tap mine with a ball peen 
hammer as I turned it a few times and respray it until it finally let go/  
Keep trying and the drum will losen up and you can work it off.  I had to go 
after the stars with the same heat valve lubricant to get them to free up.  
Spray them and let them sit for awhile they use a pair of water pumps to turn 
them.  Don't break them.  If they won't turn spray them some more and let the 
lubricant do its job.  Mine were frozen big time but I finally got everything 
free and turning.  Then take them out and lubricate them and replace them and 
your brakes will adjust easily.
