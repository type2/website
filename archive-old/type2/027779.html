&gt;&lt;&lt; I wouldn't want to drive on a long trip to anywhere in a car that's 
&gt;worth $2000 or $3000. Consider it a measurement of risk. &gt;&gt;

Different yard sticks for different people, I guess. This weekend passed the 
53K mark on our $400 junker Westfakia (CYW in Tenn...GREAT parts supply as 
usual). There have been few problems..well, Karl might think more than a few 
:), but in our 45K travels/year..all in Vintage Vdubbs, we've been either 
fortunate with the travel gods..or VW built a fairly reliable product. I 
have little fear of taking off on a 1k mile round trip with minimal 
preparation.

While it's true we are retired and so don't have the gotta-get-back 
pressures of a working stiff, I also took a 63 Notchback crosscountry...with 
small kids... 3 tmes in the mid to late 70's..and I did &quot;have to get there&quot; 
then.

If a possible small delay is bothersome, You'd prolly be better off saving 
the bus for saturday trips..but the time comes when most of us are able to 
get rid of the SUK's etc....and go with the flow.

Good luck til then.

Bus question:

Ran into several folks (two of whom own &quot;VW shops&quot;) this weekend, who say 
they leave the upper left engine hanger bolt out of the upright &quot;because 
it's hard to get to&quot;. Getting ready to hang one back in..and I definitely 
don't recall that being more than a minor problem, overcome by a few well 
chosen words ...tho I futz mostly with pancakes lately. Anyone running with 
3 bolts?

Thanks, Marv Krupp..buyer of a million parts..eater of beans-only this 
month...
