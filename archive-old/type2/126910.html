&gt; Bus Depot use to sell a side tent for around $200.00. I no longer see

they should respond back. And they should say that the mid priced tent
~200 is on backorder and should be in stock in the next few weeks. I
was given one for Christmas from family and have been waiting till
they get in. Apparently these are even nicer than the last batch.
Unfortunately they won't be in for everybus, but i'd rather wait and
get what I think I will really need.
