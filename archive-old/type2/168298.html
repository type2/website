Subject: Changed my brake fluid and now I have NO brakes, what did I
  miss???

I just got done doing my brakes with the help of my wife (since Duroc seems
to be nursing an illness).

I followed the Bentley just as I believe I was supposed to and I have NO
brakes.

First I removed the old stuff from the back and the front (opened up the
bleeders and pumped the peddle until each one went dry - then closed them
up.).

Next I filled the reservoir and starting with the front right, opened the
bleeder and had her slowly push the peddle to the floor until it was down,
tightened the bleeder, and had her let the peddle up filling the reservoir
every now and then.

I did the exact process that Bentley describes and officially have the same
brakes I had when I removed all the fluid.

What did I miss?

Now when I hit the brakes, for the VERY first time, the B light goes on when
the peddle hits the floor!!!

This is the first time I have replaced brake fluid and I thought that I got
everything right.

Anyone got an idea of what I missed?

The greatest single cause of atheism in the world today is Christians, who
acknowledge Jesus with their lips and walk out the door, and deny Him by
their lifestyle. That is what an unbelieving world simply finds
unbelievable.
