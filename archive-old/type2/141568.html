Subject: Re: [T2] big-o 1/2 inch breaker bar

My &quot;other&quot; ride is a Duelie Chevy PU. It  has 15/16 inch lug nuts on it,
with 95lb torque. I keep a Snap-On 3/4 inch breaker bar with a 6 point 15/16
impact socket, plus a 3 ft length of pipe as a cheater. I've never broke or
even bent the bar or socket. Of course it has a lifetime warranty if I do.
Now the down side is price, about $35.00 when I bought it, a lot of $$$'s
but only once.
    So does that make it a Double Big-O Breaker Bar? ;-)
    You know a good place to look for tools is your local Pawn Shop. A
warning, only buy name tools, Snap-On, Craftsman, Mac, Proto, etc. The same
lifetime warranty applies to them, the tool company's don't know where you
bought the tool.

Two wrongs don't make right,
But three lefts do.

&gt; &gt; &gt; recommend a 1/2 drive breaker bar or slider bar that happily takes
&gt; &gt; &gt; 300+ ftlbs of torque.
