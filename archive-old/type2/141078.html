Subject: Re: [T2] An article from globeandmail_dot_com

&gt;I read down to the vehicles stats.  VW seems to never learn.  Leather 
&gt;seats,
&gt;powered sliding doors, a five screen theater system...
&gt;It doesn't sound like it's going to be affordable. :O(

--------------

I dunno, the Chrysler T&amp;C vans have all that (maybe not 5 screens!) and they 
are affordable...

If they tweak the exterior and add a VW badge they could probably do it....

I am looking forward to the final design as I am a long-time Dodge and VW 
driver...

OBC = I have 2 :)
