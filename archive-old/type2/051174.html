Subject: [T2] FS (or trade) NOS '79-'83 heat exchangers

I have the following I need to sell or trade.

drivers side '79 Bus exchanger, 49 state, VW NOS $225 obo
(1 year box is 1/2 of what allows you to put a square port engine
into a bay window, the quality is unbelievable compared to Dansk)

drivers side '82-'83 Vanagon exchanger, CA, with EGR, VW NOS, $150 obo

drivers side '80-'81 Vanagon exchanger, CA, no EGR, good used, $50 obo
(has nice solid flanges, sure the boxes don't go but the flanges do
rust, particularly if they make it out of CA)

You pay actual shipping out of WV.

I will trade either of the new ones for a '72-'74 NOS German passenger
side box, or the used for a used '72-'74 passenger side in like good
condition (would consider a used Dansk in good shape.)  Will also
trade for a NOS '79-'83 CA crossover pipe.

If you need em, talk to me.
