Subject: Re: The Beast learns a new trick.

&gt; I went out and started up this morn and the engine back-fired.
&gt;
&gt; It seldom does this and I expect I need a tune up.
&gt;
&gt; In any case I get a pow! clank!
&gt;
&gt; What is this clank!
&gt;
&gt; I have gotten wiser with pain so tho I had already moved to re-start
&gt;I shut it off.
&gt;
&gt; There should be no clink.
&gt;
&gt; I get back there and all looks fine.
&gt;
&gt; There is this knock-out plug looking thing laying on the lip of the
&gt;rear clip.
&gt;
&gt; It looks like one of those gizmos for a cast electrical box.
&gt;
&gt; Cast - Concave surface on other side - - -  carburetor?
&gt;
&gt; I get down and look and directly in the back of the carby (fif)
&gt;is a hole a half inch in diameter. Right out of the venturi.
&gt;
&gt; Just like it was planned. This is a new Brazilian 30 PICT3.
&gt;
&gt; Little round cast indent with the Great Pyrimid of Alabama or some
&gt;such.
&gt;
&gt; So I stuck it back in, the wrong way of course, slapped a piece of
&gt;duct tape over it and went to breakfast.
&gt;
&gt; Suck on this, Carby.
&gt;
&gt; When I got home I saw it had an up and a down, thin and thick section
&gt;so I slathered it with epoxy and popped it home.
&gt;
&gt; It runs fine so I guess good triumphs over evil once more.
&gt;
&gt; I feel my karma is getting a little thin tho.

This happened fairly often, and we used to stick it back in just like you did.
All should be well.

your pal,

Yug
