Subject: EMERGENCY IGNITION WIRING  HELP

Hi,

My 78 Westfalia just pooped out. I installed a Tiger CDI module 5 years ago and have had intermittent hiccups, but until recently have not quetioned the problem. It seems however, that wiring may be causing me problems.

I want to revert to old-school stock ignition wiring. Can someone please describe and/or draw a diagram of the coil/points/condenser/CPU trigger circuit so that I can rewire things and drive my bus home. It has been a long time and I forget the wiring.

Near as I can figure, the CDI module is not triggering the CPU to inject fuel. I know I have a spark and I have always been suspicious that the signal to the CPU has been deficient. I just want to rewire back to stock configuration and drive home.

Please email wiring of all the ignition and/or attach hand drawn figure of how to rewire.

thanks,
Bob
