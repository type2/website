&quot;1440 Kg = approx 3200 pounds
2000 Kg  = approx 4400 pounds
BTW an empty bus (not a camper) is 1300 Kg (2900 pounds). I guess a beetle is around 800 kg (1800 pounds).&quot;

It seems like the &quot;golden rule&quot; of engine displacement for the North American continent (which does not suffer from extremely high gasoline prices or vehicle tax based on displacement) is about 1 cubic centimeter to the pound.  This would explain why many current automotive journalists praise new vehicles with this ratio and decry those that are lower.  It also explains why the 1706cc Type 1 engine is so popular (for an 1800lb bug) and why the 1300/1600/1700/1800/2000/2100/2200cc Bus/Vanagon engines are relatively underpowered.  Using the above &quot;rule&quot;, a Westy should have a 4.0L engine.
