Subject: Re: [T2] Towing a Campermobile with a Vanagon?

Hello Guys  I do my towing with a 86 sycro using a tow dolly . The sycro has 
done very well at towing but then its a good bit heavier than the reg. 
Vanagon. I have towed bay windows over some steep mts. with it. going was slow but 
had no problems,. Have had more problems out of the vehicles that I was towing, 
but most of them were project  VWs that had sat for years which are always an 
adventure to tow. My last one was a  wild one, lost 4 lugs on one rear wheel, 
robbed off of the 2 front wheels to replace them, then had both axle nuts try 
to come off cause the last guys didn't put anything in the cotter pin holes. 
Carry tools, jack, spare tires, etc, be careful, don't make the mistake I did 
and check everything before towing, Much easier to fix sitting in the driveway 
than on the side of I40 like I was doing.  Later and have fun  Mark Dearing
