Subject: Re: Two questions...

Mike,
The elevated RPM at idle may be due to a gummy throttle valve failing to 
close all the way. With the EGR returning its exhaust gases that way, the 
valve can get gummed up. You could check by seeing if you cut the rpm by 
twisting the valve toward the closed position. If so, then remove the valve 
and clean (get a new gasket before you start). Another possibility is that 
the auxiliary air valve isn't closing after a few minutes. You could measure 
its resistance (should be 30 ohms). Another possiblity is that there is an 
air leak in the supply to that valve which requires you to ramp up the idle 
speed adjustment when the engine is cold, then when the valve closes the 
idle speed just stays high. Check the air supply hose to the valve for a 
leak.
High CO does mean too rich a mixture, which may be related to your idle 
problem or it could be separate (such as the idle mixture screw on the AFM; 
if you are close to passing smog, then 1/4 or 1/2 turn counter-clockwise 
turn on that screw may do the trick.).
