Subject: Re: [T2] Engine-neering - combustion chamber question


&gt;to get more heat not more power.

Excellent motivation!!! &lt;grin&gt;

&gt;  More heat from the heating system that is. I believe I saw this on an 
&gt; American web site, if somebody knows this site could the E.mail me. As 
&gt; the exhaust system is positively air cooled by the engine fan (type 4 
&gt; engine) I cannot see heat build up being a problem. Also on my type 4 
&gt; engined bus the air for the induction is drawn in from the front of the 
&gt; engine (fuel tank side) not the side vents on the van.


Wierd. Do you not have an air cleaner than takes it's air from the engine 
compartment just like the fan and they are both supplied by the elephant 
ear scoops at the top rear of the bus???

Just curious - maybe you've got a system I've never seen (likely)...

Do you have fuel injection or carbs?

European spec bus?
