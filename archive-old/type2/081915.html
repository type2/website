Subject: Leaking gas from left rear after fill up


&gt;
&gt; Could you guys give me some help on finding this
&gt; particular fuel line?

Ray,
Reach up into the hole under the spare tire well.  The well be a metal line
follow it up and down eventually you will find a 2 inch piece of fuel line.
It is for the vapor recovery system and almost no one replaces it.  So if
anyone out there has not changed it themselves recently please do ASAP... We
could have had a major fire on the way home if hadn't of know and caught it.

This line is on pancake engines.  I am unsure if it is on uprights.

Peace Brothers and Sisters,
snoopy
