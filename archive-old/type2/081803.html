Subject: Re: [T2] Still wondering if there is a shifter plate?

Yes, it is supposed to have the plate. Go here and look at #6:
http://www.bug-bits.freeserve.co_dot_uk/ramva/fiche/t205700.gif

As far as 'will a bug work'? I don't know. But I can get you the plate from a
bus.



&gt; Hi Everyone,
&gt; I still need advice on if the type 2 shifter is supposed to have that plate
sandwiched between the shifter base and the floor like a beetle does.  If so,
can one from a beetle be used?
&gt; Any help would be appreciated.
