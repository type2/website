You need to suck.  There will air in the master and nothing getting to the
slave
cylinder, it can't pull for some reason even though it has all that head
above it from the resevoir being up there a foot or 2.   This is why the
book says pressure only but nonsense.  2 options, first crack the line at
the master and pump away slowly, stuff should flow maybe sputtery at first,
an old towel laying under the cylinder is a must.  if you can get it going
to this point, and if you put the front end up, you may get it to go like a
brake.  Second and better, and in a pinch even a 1 man job, this is the only
time I've ever found the MityVac to be worth its weight in gold.  Go to
Walmart get the kit for $30 (hey you can test distributors, use it on brakes
as the resevoir is convenient) now it ain't going to pull though and 1 man
bleed like they say, but if you have one person pumping the mityvac
frantically back on the slave bleeder (just crack it enough so you don't
merely pull air up around the bleed screw threads, some grease smeared
around the base of the screw helps in fact, just a pinch) while the other
person pumps the front you can easily get it quickly bled without even first
cracking the line at the master.  If you are alone, in a pinch you can pump
it up, run up front pump a bit, run back etc.  Once you get most of the air
out of the  master and line it will bleed just like a regular brake pretty
well.

Anyway, all hail the MityVac on this one, and you'll find lots of weird
occasional uses for it anyway.  I use it in the same manner when doing
brakes, like I said a nice convenient resevoir and I don't have to worry
about keeping the hose in the fluid and all.

Ideas that gravity will let fluid run through are nonsense, I've only had a
few brake systems where this has even been the case, though if one looks at
a clutch master, perhaps if you had the pedal slightly depressed or
something it might but I don't think so.  It has been a bit since I rebuilt
one but I'm pretty sure the port up to the resevoir is initially exposed
then is sealed off (obviously so it goes one way only) when the cup seal
proceeds down then forces stuff out the line to the slave port which is
initially sealed by a lower cup seal then exposed.  I don't get why they
start to cavitate but they get air in them when you fully replace em and it
takes prebleeding or suction to get it pulled though.  Perhaps fluid needs
to fill under the spring and second cup initially, I don't know I'd have to
take one apart and look again at how it works.
