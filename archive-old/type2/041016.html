Subject: Seat hardware?

  Hi folks. Having acquired seats for my 69 bus- now the next step is 
attaching them. Wondering if anyone has the required seat hardware to attach 
the bench seats to the floor, also the hardware that goes on the back of the 
rear bench- must attach by the front of the engine compartment?  I am told 
that the hardware for a bay window bench is different than a split. Willing 
to pay $$$ plus shipping, of course.
  Also- when we purchased the bus, it came with a westfalia folding seat- 
folds into a bed, has a cupboard under the seat. Does anyone need any 
hardware associated with this? The cushions are WAY shot, and the wood is in 
very poor shape too, but the hardware appears to all be intact, with very 
little rust or signs of wear. It has hardware inside the &quot;cupboard&quot; for 
folding, also has large brackets on the outside (probably to attach it to the 
bus?).
Let me know if interested- not looking for money for it- just someone that 
can use it.
