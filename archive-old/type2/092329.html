Subject: Re: [T2] Asbestos

During a &quot;Striparama&quot; of a 79 Westie yesterday, I noticed the fillers in the
accordion pipes connecting the heater flaps to the body were still asbestos...
had gotten wet,and swelled almost completely closed...I'm wondering when they
stopped using that material on bus heating systems...

On a related subject I spoke to the parts manager at my local dealership(I'd say
my favourite dealership if VWoA wasn't making such an complete a$$ of themselves
lately)  when this heater box replacement program was underway, even sent an
e-mail to VWoA, but there wasn't a recall underway in Canada at all...at least
nothing they would own up to...interesting...

Den.
