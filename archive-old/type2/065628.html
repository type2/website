Subject: Out of Africa

  What do you think, we could use that for the name of a movie, huh?

 The last story/travelogue we got from Africa, one of you guys went 
on a trip with the wife and kiddies or some such.

 I had relayed the story to a friend who also needs to escape his job
at times. 

 He in turn relayed it to a couple guys from Africa who work with him.

 He says, &quot;They went wonkey on me. Got all home-sick and snively&quot;

 The point is sir you have gained public acclaim and are being read thru-out
the civilized world.

 Kind of makes you feel like Hemmingway, don't it?

 NO - I didn't give them your name or address.

 I put my name on it :-)

 There was another guy on the list who was going to get some tales
from a friend who had spent &quot;20 years in the bush with a vw van&quot;.

 We are still waiting dude, or are you just shining us on?
