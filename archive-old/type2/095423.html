Subject: Re: [T2] (OH NO!!) OIL

I am using valvoline 50W race grade.  When the temps here are in the 
90's and i am running stop and go or high speed the oil pressure running 
wll be about 40 at 60mpg and will drop to about 15 at idle.
one quick little rain shower an idle pressure will climb to about 20 and 
highway will be about 45

&gt; Now that my guages are installed, I think I have oil pressure issues. I 
&gt; am
&gt; currently using Shell Performance 40 weight dino oil on a *moslty* stock
&gt; carburated 1.8L with 18K on an AVP rebuild. Once the oil reaches full 
&gt; temp
&gt; (~200), the idle pressure goes down dramatically. There is a 
&gt; corresponding
&gt; drop in pressure at speed as well. I am going to try using a higher 
&gt; quality
&gt; oil, specifically Castrol HD40. (The Shell is a loss leader sale oil for
&gt; Advance auto parts.) While perusing the oil shelves at my FLAPS today I
&gt; noticed that they carry Kendall 50 weight. Has anybody used this oil, 
&gt; or any
&gt; 50 weight oil, in their T4 engine? If so, what kind of results did you 
&gt; have?
