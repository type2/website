&gt; We're not discussing shorting a fuse. I don't think you understand what you
&gt; are discussing. We're not shorting anything.

what I do is put a high amp ammeter accross the fuse points.

ie:  I remove the fuse, take leads from each side to the dash board area
and hook up a 50 amp meter that I have, works pretty good when looking for
intermittent problems.  (if I draw more than 50 amps or even less and it
doesn't shut off I have a switch in one of the lines, or just pull the
wire off)
