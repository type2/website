&gt; &gt;&gt;  As I write this one
&gt; &gt;&gt;thought comes to mind that I should check and see if the distributor (a
&gt; &gt;&gt;009) is advancing correctly.

&gt; &gt;*He* says: the 009 is strictly a racing distributor, St. Muir
&gt; &gt;notwithstanding. It has a terrible advance curve for everyday driving. *He*
&gt; &gt;says, stick with the stock distributor, which I think in your case is the
&gt; &gt;centrifugal/vacuum advance, which *he* calls &quot;the best distributor VW ever
&gt; &gt;made.&quot;
&gt; 
&gt; *he* sounds like a really smart feller!  Down with the 009!

Let me here waste a little bandwidth with a huge &quot;ME TOO!&quot;  I was never so
unhappy with an alleged &quot;improvement&quot; as I was with the 009 distributor.
I seriously recommend that you haunt junkyards in search of the stock
distributor.
