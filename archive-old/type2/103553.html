Subject: 79 Westy at Hayward Pick n Pull

Someone gave me a tip about a Sage Green 79 Westy (P22) at the Pick n Pull in Hayward, CA (at end of Winton). I went to visit and took a few parts.

It was a well kept bus and there's still a lot of good stuff there but it did suffer an engine fire so write that whole area off. However it must have been put out quickly because the smoke damage is limited to the inner compartment (the afm, charcoal cannister and air cleaner melted sorry).

While it's still fresh in my mind (email me for details if you like)...

What's there:

- under dash factory A/C (all there except compressor)
- speedo, fuel gauge, blank plate in 3rd hole
- green side cushion
- green plaid rear deck mattress and storage locker underneath
- green plaid folding upper bunk
- complete 79 CA exhaust (heater boxes look good, the rest is rusty)
- poptop in nice condition (no mold on inside)
- poptop canvas. A few rips but better than nothing. Front screen in tact.
- most of cabinet interior
- westy table
- ceiling cabinet
- ice box rack
- passenger side kick panel
- washer fluid tank with all caps and rings
- egr speedo box
- rear seat belts
- 79 CA ECU
- rear cabinet
- water tank and faucet
- driver side jalousie window
- front carpet, green (ok condition on drivers side, good on passenger, underside good)
- green walkthru carpet and middle carpet in good condition
- rear glass, heated
- fuel filler tube
- overhead cab light
- nice steering wheel
- both bumpers
- bumper overriders on rear (saw at least 1, don't quote me on 2)
- starter w/ solenoid
- all of the wiring behind the dash, relays, etc
- cvs and axles removed as one unit, sitting under bus
- rear drums
- brake fluid reservoir (no lid)
- headlight trim rings and adjustment hardware

What's not:

- transmission (gone to mexico!)
- fuel pump
- original headliner in cab
- closet door mirror
- child's cot
- rear green plaid cushion
- both front doors
- sliding door
- washer hoses, connectors, valve
- indicator cancelling ring ;-)
- engine lid
- fuel retaining ring
- CA fuel filler neck
- red, blue levers
- fuel gauge vibrator
- most of the cabinet handles
- spare wheel cover
- bilstein jack under passenger seat

Notes:

- FI fuel tank punctured on bottom but the hole is small (I pulled it to check)
- fuel sender replacement from 87 but not working.
- seats are ripped at beading and stuffing gone but lots of material
- front seat belts cut
- glove box knob broken
- jalousie mosquito screen ripped but one frame there
- engine hatch burned on inside, ok on topside
- fresh air grill bent, inner screen broken
- duct tape on fresh air vents?
- all wood grain in good-excellent conditon
- no turn signal, side markers, rear lenses (pair of front side markers with silver trim on another bus)
- cardboard glovebox torn
- my memory of the front wheels is foggy...

Yes, I did spend a long time there...Let the pillaging commence!
