Subject: Re: [T2] Engine removal question.

You may need to loosen the transmission mounts so it will sag a bit,
allowing the engine to slide out. Otherwise, pull the transmission too.
When I did the clutch in my '86 Porsche 911 last fall, I pulled the engine
and transmission together as a unit. All you have to do is take out two
more bolts (the trans mount), disconnect a couple more sending wires, and
unbolt the CV axles (big pain the ass - soak in liquid wrench overnight and
buy the best socket you can to avoid stripping the heads - and they torque
like a mofo).

When I helped Adrian put the engine back in my bus, he had separated the
trans and engine. I believe we had to loosen the trans and let it sag to
get the 1.8l pancake to line up as we put it in.

And it never ceases to amaze me just how similar the pancake engine, trans,
and rear suspension in my '74 bus is to the '86 Porsche 911 I owned. The
biggest difference is the weight. The Porsche engine and trans was about
800 lbs whereas the bus engine and trans is about 350 lbs.
