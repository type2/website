Subject: Cam/crank timing confusion

Fellow listees,

I'm getting on well with rebuilding my 2 litre engine (slow, but I want to
do it right).  I've just got to the stage of installing the crank and cam in
the left case half and I'm following Wilson's book.  Now on page 122 he says
that the timing dots should be aligned with the case parting line when #1 is
at TDC.  I have the rotor arm lined up with the notch on the distributor
body and the crank perpendicular to the case parting line so that #1 would
be at TDC, but the timing dots are about 90 degrees from the parting line.
The gear has to be in the right place because of the woodruff key, so is
this right?

Wilson usually makes a distinction between the type 1/2 and type 4 engines
when they differ, so I'm a little confused.  Can someone set my mind at ease
before I bolt the case together?
