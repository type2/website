&gt; So I have decided to look at bay windows now, and I have
&gt; a few questions.... what year did they
&gt; move all the cabinets to the drivers side?  Also could
&gt; you get stoves in them?  What options would a fully
&gt; loaded westy come with for say a 1978 or 1979 model.
&gt; How much weight will the upper bed hold?  What about
&gt; heat in those models?



I have a beginners' buyers guide to '68-91 campers at
http://www.busdepot_dot_com/campers.htm that should answer most of your
questions.
