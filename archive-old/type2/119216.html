Most professional autobody paint suppliers have computerized
camera equipment and will match any sample you can provide
in several paint systems. No charge for the match, just for the
paint you buy.They also stock &quot;Preval&quot; spray containers which are
reusable and easily recharged. Google &quot;Preval&quot;, they are around $10.

&gt; I really want some L90D in spraycans, but I can't deal with $30+ per can.
&gt; Are there any readily available alternatives that are decent quality and a
&gt; close match?
