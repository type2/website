&gt; &gt;The question of the hour is.... did '74 deluxes
&gt; &gt;come with both the console box and the 4 legged stool?
&gt; 
&gt; as far as i know 74' came with the &quot;console box&quot; or whatever you call it
to
&gt; my knowledge 1973 was the last year for the stool.
&gt; 
My 74 Deluxe has the stool and the trash container (AKA, Console box)
..appears to have come with it.  

Also, someone a few days ago indicated that orange '74's were always
the 'standard' campmobile while other colors were deluxe models.  My
74 is certainly orange and the dual battery setup, electric fridge, etc..
indicated 'deluxe' components.  I bought it from original owner who bought
it off the lot that way.  

Any clarifications on this?
