&gt;...would it be possible to
&gt;ferment some sugar or something and create your own alcohol?

I expect if we put Jonathan on it he could work it out in no time. ;)

You'd have to double-distill it, which involves heating a combustible
mixture under pressure. If you could do that without blowing up your house
(please don't try) you'd still end up with alcohol with a lot of water in
it, like 20%-30, and you wouldn't want that sitting in your cylinders over
the weekend. I doubt you could ever get anything pure enough for internal
combustion out of a home-run still no matter how brave you are. ;)
