well you really need the Bentley book too, the Muir book is based on the

&gt; horrible car-ma. I've never really taken care of my car, figuring it will
&gt; just take care of itself, so I haven't done the routine maintenance that is
&gt; necessary (resulting in new engines, and other bad things). How better to
&gt; cure myself of that than to get a car that I HAVE to take care of, and do it
&gt; all myself, take responsibility for it -- right? Anyway, I'm getting very

wellllllll, past experience is often a predicter of the future

&gt; excited about the whole idea. I used to own bugs (though I never worked on

don't let your excitement overshawdow your better instincts

&gt; them myself) so I'm not sure if this is some kind of midlife crisis, or

so what's a little midlife crisis

&gt; My questions are these:
&gt; 
&gt; Am I crazy for thinking about doing this? Turning in a perfectly good modern
&gt; car for a bus.

well crazy is a deffinition of at  least a significant part of us

&gt; Is it realistic for me to consider learning about and working on my bus
&gt; myself, with only the book to help me (my husband is more clueless than I

not unrealistic, most of us did this before the internet and learned that
way, and through lots of mistakes, some costly.

&gt; Is it possible to install shoulder harness seatbelts in the back seat (for
&gt; the aforementioned car seats), and if so, who will do it (I've called a
&gt; couple shops in the area and no one will do it because of liability issues).

yes, BUT.  you will probably have to do it yourself, although the later
vans (not sure when it started) have mounts for two in the rear seats (one
on each side)

&gt; Is there someone in the Bellingham, WA area who will accept a panicked phone

well I'm a little far, on the East coast, BUT you are near the (in)Famous
Dr Tim...maybe one of the more knowledgeble (and irrascible) guru's on
the list he might help yyou, but he is in business and he isn't likely to
do much for free.

&gt; This will be my daily driver, is that okay? I don't drive much, but I don't

maybe a 1/3 of this list have daily drivers, mine is

BTDT

&gt; husband has a car and I've got family nearby (though they'd get pretty tired
&gt; of me if I was constantly asking to borrow a car.)

having a spare car sure makes it easier, I lived where there was good
public transit so many a time I jumped on the bus with a part in hand
going to get the replacement.

&gt; 
&gt; I've done some research and I'm pretty sure I want disc brakes (which means

very highly reccomended, especially if you are not very strong

&gt; 1971 or newer, right?) but it sounds like I don't want fuel injection
&gt; because it would be too complicated (which means pre-1975, right?) How
&gt; important do you think this is? Will the fuel injection really throw me off?

well, I have fuel injection and since you have no bad Carb habits to break
it might not be as hard as you think

&gt; There's a guy in town with a '79 for sale that sounds pretty good (just a

79 was an excellent year, and except for an odd exhaust port is pretty
standard.

&gt; little rust, and the price is pretty good, though there's a hole in the

rust can be a little devil,  if you see a little there could be a lot
hidden, especially important is to check the front beam for rust. it is an
expensive and time consuming repair.  (parts alone cost me over $600 on
mine)

&gt; muffler). Should I not consider this bus because of the fuel injection?

your call, are you willing to learn the Fuel Injection system, it is
pretty straight forward but to repair it you must be very methodical and
follow the instructions exactly, not skipping any steps. but there is a
pretty good trouble shooting manual in the library if you can't find one 

&gt; Anyway, any advice is much appreciated! And if you've made it this far you
&gt; get a scooby snack.

thanks I need one
&quot;you really do have too much spare time on your hands eh??&quot;


good luck
