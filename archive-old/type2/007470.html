The carbon monoxide being heavier than air will completly displace any OX in the tank -No OX- NO FIRE - This is foolproof .I have used it many times on auto and bike tanks.

Whoa! The molecular wieght of O2 is 32, CO is just 28. I think the correct way to do this is to fill it with CO2 (40) (which with water (18) is the main component of exhaust).

Sorry if this seems like a chemistry lesson :)
