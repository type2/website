My original equipment, low mileage (only 172k miles)
transmission has recently began shifting into 1st and
3rd with what I would describe as a squishy feeling.
Shifting into 2nd, 4th and reverse still has a
positive feeling, a definite click. This has only
started in the last month. Is this an internal
transmission problem, meaning I should start looking
for another tranny, or could this be a linkage problem
that I can tighten or replace worn parts? TIA
