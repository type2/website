Subject: Window Seals

Hi All,

I guess I should start by searching the back list files
(and sermons if they are still available) but,

I recently got new seals for the passenger door of my
Westy. I've never done this before but need to renew
both doors before winter.

Any sage advice from anyone who has done this?
I got everything as a kit from Ron Salmon &gt; do I need
anything else before I launch into the project?
Maybe an adhesive?, or do they all press fit in?

Thanks in advance,

Mike Dulany
