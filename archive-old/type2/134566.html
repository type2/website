Subject: Great day for my VW

Today I finally got the bus back to its old self again. After a year of
struggling with a clutch problem I finally got it right today. I had replaced
the entire clutch &quot;system&quot; any and all things to do with the clutch. After
replacing everything I still had the same problem. So a freind gave me another
known good clutch pressure plate and today I replaced the clutch again. after
the install it seems to have fixed the problem. The pressure plate I had used
before was a brand new sachs unit. I guess it was bad out of the box. Has
anyone ever had this problem? Anyway I am gonna give it a nice long test drive
tomorrow during the day light. I hope this has fixed the problem. I am tired
of not having a bus to drive....
