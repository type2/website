Hi,

&gt; ... I called my local tire guy and asked for 195/75R14 C tires with
&gt; reinforced sidewalls.

&gt; He says he has a Toyo tire, grade C made for light trucks and SUV's. So
&gt; he installs them today (great deal all 4 installed/balanced $210), I
&gt; pick it up and I find the tires are not C rated. They turn out to be
&gt; Toyo 185/75R14 92S.

He has fitted an underspec tyre against your specific instructions.
If this doesn't make him liable for prosecution, I'd be very surprised.
Certainly if you were to have an accident which might be attributable 
he could anticipate being sued for professional misconduct.

 The 185/75 size is too small and the 92S rating is inadequate.

 This rating is CRUCIAL: It indicates what the weight and speed
rating of the tyre is, and is INTERNATIONAL and OBLIGATORY.

 You shouldn't fit a tyre to a bus that has a number less than 95
and that's the absolute bare minimum (1520lbs). To do so is akin
to fitting S-rated (112mph) tyres to a 150mph Mustang: they arn't
up to the job, are illegal and dangerous.

 To get acceptable handling most listees recommend at least a 97 
load index (roughly equivalent to a six-ply rating) which equates
to 1609lbs, to be honest 99 (1709lbs) or so works better. This is
in the vicinity of an &quot;eight ply rating&quot; tyre. If you push up into
&quot;load range D&quot; territory then you are looking at 100/102 load 
indices (max load about 1800lbs) and you start to trade a firm
ride against more stability (ie not if you have a bad back!!).

 Look for the load index number: the letter indicates the speed
rating and shouldn't be an issue for stock busses with sane 
drivers: anything over an &quot;N&quot; is fine and practically any modern
tyre will be at least an &quot;R&quot;, unless you are buying seriously 
heavy duty van tyres. All tyres should have one (don't buy a tyre
without) and the numbers above tell you what to expect.

 Be very firm with the tyre guy who sold you the Toyos: his
incompetence and desire to sell what he has in stock could kill
your kids...

Cheers,
