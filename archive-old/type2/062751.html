Jonathan -
I had a similar problem with a '67 Sqbk.  The parking brake lever arm 
rusted to the plate that it slides against.  A few bangs with a 
hammer against the inside of the brake assembly and viola ! Temporary 
fix.  Gotta take the wheel off and clean the brake assembly.

&gt; several folks have mentioned rusty brake shoes....but the shoes are lest then a
&gt;  month old. would they rust that much that fast?
