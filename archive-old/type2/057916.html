Actually I don't remember this being a FAQ. Probably because it's fairly
self-explanatory once you get started...

--This is Type I only. Type I Split people don't have to support their
transaxles though:

--You have a Muir or a Haynes at least, right? For the money the Muir is an
awesome investment and the Haynes is a helluva lot better than nothing.

--All this about supporting the transaxle with chains is a bunch of
time-consuming nonsense. Get a bottle jack, center it on that seam on the
bottom of the trans, raise the jack 'til it's barely tense. In a pinch you
can use bricks or even a big roadside rock. In a REAL pinch you can let it
rest on the CVs, just don't drop it on them with any force.

--When they say &quot;label everything&quot; they mean you. Even if you're quite sure
you'll remember where everything goes. Even though there aren't that many
hoses and wires. If you can't say from memory whether the top outlet on the
fuel pump runs to the carb or the tank, and which vaccum ports are
connected to where, while you're sitting there at the computer--then you
lable everything. This will save you hours of frustration.

--PULL THE FIREWALL AND RENEW EVERY FUEL LINE INCLUDING THE SOFT VENT TUBES
while you have the engine out. This includes the solid fuel line, and
isolate it from the engine tin with a rubber grommet. If you put this off
until next time you may as well just light the damn thing on fire and be
done with it. It's about time for another burn story on the list, it's been
about three weeks since the last. At least if you choose the time and place
for the burning nobody will likely get hurt.

--The most frustrating thing for me has always been those ring clamps right
on top of the moustache (the moustache is that big crosswise bar between
the muffler and the engine). The clamps are tiny and inconsequential but
they always defeat me. Welding on flanges eliminated this headache
(archive: &quot;muffler flanges&quot; ought to do it I betcha).

--There are these cheap but small Chinese floor jacks you can get at the
Wal-Mart. It has gotten to the point where I don't know anybody who doesn't
have one of these. They aren't much good for changing tires for their small
stature but they make ideal engine-pulling tools. Center it on the drain
plate, roll it out, it works slicker than snot. It is extraordinarily tiny
for a jack and can stow almost anywhere. Runs around $20, sometimes it's
packaged with these suspicious sand-casted jackstands for around $25. I
would not trust those things to save my skull from a falling bus but it's
better than cinder blocks I guess 8).

--Once you've done it a few times you can have it out by yourself in
(realistically) 45 minutes to one hour. With help, an hour to 90 minutes.
8) Solo on gravel add an hour, solo with almost no tools add an additional
hour (the engine gets propped up with scavenged stuff and the bus is pushed
away with your feet).
