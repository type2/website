While trying to stay topical, I wanted to remind everybody that as part of
our package with digital-galaxy_dot_net we have an entire IRC server all to
ourselves to use anytime we like to our hearts' content, and that is the
appropriate place to grouse about the admin and whatnot.

Sometimes they even talk about VWs there. =^ )

Point your IRC client to irc.type2_dot_com. People usually hit #buslist first.
See you there.
