What this says to me is a timing problem.  Are your vacumn hoses on correctly?
Ported vacumn line from the throttle body to the dist.  Vacumn line 
from the center of the air distributor to the decel valve, FPR (fuel 
pressure regulator).
What is your timing, idle, dwell set at?  Does the timing advance 
when you accelerate (use you strobe light to see whats happening here)

I know this engine of mine has stumped some of the better minds on this
list with it's refusing to idle.. I had to take it in for the emissions
test today and the results may illuminate those more knowledgable about
this than I

todays test results were
HC - 5925ppm  - fail
CO -0.00  -  pass
CO2 -14.5%  - pass

the previous test before it was worked on
HC - 1762  - fail
CO -  0.17%  -  pass
CO2 - 14.32 % - pass

FYI the state standard is
HC 430ppm
CO 5.5%
CO2 6.0%

now I know this information tells some of you folks &quot;Something&quot; but I'm
not sure what it tells me except that after all this work it is
essentially worse....  my Hydrocarbons went through the sky, Why????

I assume it is too rich???

this is a 78 stock FI 2liter with auto tranny

thanks
Bob
