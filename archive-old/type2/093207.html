Subject: Re: [T2] Frozen Brakes!??

Shoes are stuck to the drums. Basically your emergency brake is stuck. This 
can be caused by the shoes being rusted to the drums (my sister's Dodge 'K' 
car 'vert did this once) but that usually happens after the vehicle is 
parked for a while.

Next would be rusted e-brake cables or frayed e-brake cables causing the 
shoes to remain firmly planted against the drums.

Does the vehicle rock like it is in gear - slight rocking motion with a 
slight clunking motion as the play in the driveshafts and tranny is taken 
up in one direction and then the other direction?

If so the brakes are not stuck and you have a drivetrain problem 
(tranny/axles).

If the bus won't rock backward and forward then I'd say it's the brakes or 
bearings. You can always use a rolling trolley jack to jack up ends of the 
vehicle or particular wheels to see which if any are locked up.
