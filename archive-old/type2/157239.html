Subject: Re: [T2] Timing gun issues...

Mine is a direct connection, meaning it hooks directly to either the end socket of the wire going to the distributor or the actual socket on the distributor.  Here's what the directions say to do for a 12 volt battery:

Connect the BLACK clip to the negative (-) battery terminal

Connect the RED clip to a secure engine ground such as the alternator/generator bracket or the engine block.  For safety reasons, do not use the positive (+) battery terminal or fuel sytem components as a ground connection point.
 
Are buses 12v or 6v?  If it's 6v it's gonna get sort of complicated.

The brand is Actron.
