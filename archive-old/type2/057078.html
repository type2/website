Subject: Re: Bob Hoover...theft?

[...Discussion, again, about whether Bob Hoover's Sermons can be
distributed to friends and neighbors in any medium whether for profit or
not...]

A lot of this is my fault, because fences make good neighbors, and I told
Bob months ago I'd build a bit of fence for him. We don't need miles of it,
just a sort of turnstile.

This is so trivial in Javascript I might even be able to code it myself:

	if the last URL visited was not within /sermons,
		show a dialog box whose choices are &quot;agree&quot; and &quot;home&quot;
			if home, load type2_dot_com home page
			else load sermons.index.html
	else deliver the requested document

When we punch &quot;agree&quot;, we mean that we are welcome to dl copies for
personal or classroom use but we may not distribute them to others.

If any HTML jock could bang that together we would be most grateful.
