Subject: Re: [T2] Gauge selection - design - advice

who are you going to get the vdo 110871 guage pod from?  everybody lists 
it as nla, even vdo. except for busdepot.  and it is still listed on 
their site.  call them first if that is who you are planning on ordering 
from and make real sure that they really check stock.
