Subject: Wilson, Distrib., more observations

Good Morning List.

First thing this AM I went down to the basement and looked again.
My previous post has one incorrect statement.  When #1 piston is at TDC
the rotor tip is AFTER the dizzy mark(clockwise rotation) by 1/4 inch.
Not before the dizzy mark as I had posted earlier.  Sorry, ...the sun
got in my eyes. :)

So,  on the crank pulley here's the sequence:  rotor tip and dizzy mark
line up(pointing directly at #1 spark plug hole) and I make a mark on 
the pulley.  The piston continues up the cylinder toward TDC and the 
rotor moves another 1/4 inch.  At TDC the pulley has traveled an add-
itional 1 inch to where I made another mark.

Is this correct?
By this sequence it seems that the air fuel mixture would be firing 
before TDC is reached.
I'm assuming that once the engine is running I will have to make more
adjustments but I'm a bit afraid to start it up.  Good thing it's not
ready yet.
BTW Karl,  that Wilson description was for the type I engine.  I 
neglected to mention that the engine is a 1600 DP.  That sun thing 
again.

What's the consensus?  Are these the right sequences?
Any other adjustments?
