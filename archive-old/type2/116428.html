Subject: part id help

hi all,
 
i am trying to figure out what this is and what it does. (see http://home.earthlink_dot_net/~jamaica_cousins ) 
it was attached with the coil onto the fan housing on my 70 westfalia .  the wire was not connected, just hanging there.  can ya tell me what it is and what it does? the vw part number reads 111 035 267A. it doesnt come up on any searches ive done.
 
thanks for the help!
 
asaph
