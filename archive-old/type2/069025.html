Subject: Clutch Adjustment/Engine Enplay Questions '71 Bus

Hi folks,

I have a puzzle I'm trying to work-out that I need some feedback on. While
waiting for parts for my engine rebuild to arrive, I've been contemplating
the one problem with the 1600 I currently have in my '71 that I'd like to
avoid with the fresh rebuild.  Over the course of its 70k mile life so far,
my current engine's endplay worsened to the point where it could no longer
be corrected by shimming (the least amount of shimming to correct the latest
.020&quot; of endplay resulted in the crank siezing).  If history repeats itself
as I'm sure it will, failure of the front oil seal followed by a oil fouled
disk are the next problems.

I've seen it mentioned that clutch &quot;shuddering&quot; can be caused from improper
shimming of the clutch cable tube--improper slack there causing the the
throw-out bearing to bounce against the pressure plate.  This prolonged
banging from the weight of the flywheel/clutch assembly can cause the engine
case or thrust bearings to pound out, causing a premature increase in crank
endplay.   This is probably what happened in my case, since as I describe
below, I've had problems getting the plastic clutch tube to deflect properly.  

Ok, so assuming that's how it happened.  My recurring dilemma has been that
even when I have tried variously thick stacks of washers or even no washers
to shim the clutch tube, I cannot get the tube to deflect as it does in the
sketch in the Bentley book (you know, the picture that shows the tube
slightly bowed where you should be able to measure the slack).  I replaced
this tube 35k miles ago when I put in a new cable and clutch plate, so the
parts themselves are in top shape.  (Also, I've had two german Sachs
pressure plates on this engine during its life.  The first broke at 35,000
miles, but it also had unknown mileage on it from a previous engine, so
total mileage on the part is unknown.  My current pressure plate is still
going strong after 35,000 miles, although I plan to get a new one that will
be balanced with other rotating parts on my next engine. The clutch disks
I've periodically replaced when they get contaminated with oil.)

I have clutch shuddering symptoms now, especially starting up in first gear.
The only way to pull away from a light smoothly is to rev the engine and
slowly let off the clutch till the shudder disappears.  At this point, I
don't know if I can attribute this to the tube, an oily clutch disk, or the
fact that the engine does not have proper endplay.  I'm guessing that at
this point even if I had the clutch tube were adjusted correctly, the oily
disk and/or the out of spec endplay would yield the same symptoms of
shuddering, making troubleshooting and corrective action a lesson in futility.

So my questions are:  

1. Have I assessed this problem correctly?  

2. Assuming the clutch cable tube is somehow correct despite that its
curvature does not match the Bentley diagram, what else could be causing
engine recurrent endplay woes and shuddering?  

3. Assuming, as the  Bentley diagram suggests, that the tube bend spec is
incorrect, how do you create that little measurable bump in the tube to give
the cable slack?? (no matter how many shims I use, my tube just makes a
gentle bend from the metal clutch tube to the arm mount on the transmission).  

I wondered for awhile if the diagram in the Bentley was a carryover
instruction from the Bentley for Type Is, that perhaps the bend is
achievable with a bug tube, but the bus transmission position/metal tube
geometry is somehow different, making the procedure different.

Anyhow, thanks for listening--I'll try fiddling with it this weekend.  I've
seen similar questions asked before on the list, but the responses didn't
shed any light on resolving my problem.  Any feedback is appreciated--I'd be
especially interested in anyone who gets their plastic-coated clutch cable
tube to bend just like the diagram in Bentley (without using smoke and
mirrors ;).

Thanks,
