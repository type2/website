Subject: Re: [T2] Help! Bus broke down!

You will need a quality wire cutter to cut off the frayed end. Remove the 
Bowden Tube on the side of the tranny.  Then go to the front, remove the 
bolt holding the pedal, remove the two bolts holding the clutch pedal 
pivot, pull it out, remove the clevis pin, pull out the old cable, install 
the new cable reversing procedures, adjust cable at the cross shaft lever.

When you buy the cable, get a new clevis pin as well. In most cases they 
will be worn as well. There simply is not enough clearance to substitute a 
bolt and nut for the clevis pin.
