&gt;not everyone runs micro$oft windoz.......
&gt;
&gt;Bob
&gt;running a Linux box and no intention of ever using windoz anything!  sort
&gt;of like driving a type 2, damn good even if not every one can appreciate
&gt;it.

Oh I agree whole heartedly, but in order to reach the most people, a GUI
based application would need to either be Java based (and therefore require
the end user to need to know how to run java applications), or be a Win32
application...  In a perfect world, Windows would die off like the inferior
product that it is, but unfortunately, it is _the_ operating system of the
masses (we're not even going to start with apple here) and so for the time
being I'll live within those limitations and deal with it :)  No point in
making a stand and saying NO just out of the principal of it since we all
know that no one is going to change to Unix/Linux/HPUX/who-cares just so
they can run a little Type2 information app thingy...

Hoping I didn't just start the infamous &quot;my OS is better than your OS&quot;
argument,
Dan
