Subject: Loctite

As I read the various posts on red vs. blue Loctite I have a small bit of
heartburn.  It isn't that simple!  Loctite makes 50+ threadlocker products
and the color of the fluid and its properties are related only in so far
as strength are concerned.  Removability is a completely separate
specification as is wicking ability, compatibility with materials, and
temperature and solvent resistance.  If you choose the wrong product then
you are due for a choice slice of hell when it loosens in use or when it
comes time to remove the fastener.  I will be calling Loctite over the
next couple days in an attempt to develop a matrix of type # and
properties which I will post.  This will have to be on a &quot;time available&quot;
basis and it may be a week before I complete it.

                             OOK!
