Subject: [T2] Engine install

It's in! Woo-hoo! Dear Old Dad The Retired Aerospace Engineer couldn't
come over to help until today, so I did peripheral stuff yesterday --
installed the distributor, carburetor, tightened everything down/up,
major puttering in the engine compartment.

Last night we got our first *real* rain in SoCal! I was afraid it'd rain
today (figures), but it only sprinkled sporadically.

We rigged a way to get the crankshaft pulley off so we could install the
oil pump adapter for the support bar. Got that done with only *three*
trips to the parts store for fasteners (ok, trip #2 was because we lost
the oil pump gasket on the way home -- gawd, I hate when that happens!).
We wrestled the thing in with a mondo floor jack under the engine and my
little floor jack under the tranny and got everything matched up nice
and tight. Now I understand why people prefer to install the
engine/trans as a unit.

I still have to figure out the wiring and fuel lines, so it hasn't been
started up yet. But it's a complete unit now! Woo-hoo! I can get the
real plates for it as soon as I get the VIN verified by a law
enforcement officer.

As soon as I get $70 of disposable income I'm getting that tranny jack
Bob mentioned. I saw it at Harbor Freight yesterday and it looks pretty
cool. :-)
