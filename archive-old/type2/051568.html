Subject: RE: [T2] Westification &amp; Welding Hints

Practice, practice, practice. This is the best way to learn to weld with a
MIG welder. (do not attempt this with any other kind of welder) You need to
make sure that the two parts to be welded together are very clean, the
welder will just spit and sputter if there is paint and grease left (or
rust). 
I worked for Midas and other Muffler shops for years, my welding got better
with time. I told them I knew how to weld but had never touched a MIG
before. It took a few weeks before my welds really looked good, but things
held together from day 1. Welding an exhaust system on a car from under it,
with all the crap in the way is the worst type of welding. I have had to use
mirrors and sometimes weld blindly.
I just got myself a new 110V MIG unit. You may remember me asking about
getting one. I went to SEARS and found one on there clearance shelf. It had
been used and returned. It is fully functional and they only used a small
amount off the spool. It came with regulator and O.K. but not great mask. At
least the mask is not hand held like some. I got everything for $239, then I
got a gas bottle for $94 and some extra wire. I have yet to use it on my
car, but have played with it on scrap steel and it works great. It says
Craftsman on the case, but the cable and gun are Tweco and the Box seems to
be a Century.( I found the name in several spots) All in all I am very happy
with it.

Hey, call your local vocational or high school that has welding, that's
what teachers are for!!  They should be able to steer you toward some good
information, or night classes (even better).


&gt;Now that the cutting is finished, the next step is to weld it together. We
&gt;have a small arc-welder with a gas bottle...  but none of us have any
&gt;experience with it. If anyone knows of a good how-to video or web-page
where
&gt;I can research the technique, I'd be happy to hear from them.
