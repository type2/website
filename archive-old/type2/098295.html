Subject: Has anyone installed a BA4 up front on a Vanagon?

[...]

This thread has me thinking. There is a big space up front 
on air cooled Vanagons. Would you be able to fit a BA6 up 
there?

I will have BEHR front AC shortly and the evaporator will be 
behind the front grille, so it will have to cohabitate with 
the BA4.

Any thoughts? 

---- snip ----

here is what I have done on my 78 when I got it there was a 
non functioning A/C and a fully rusted out heat system. So I 
removed most of the A/C system, put a BA-4 (from a 412) 
under the front of the bus on the evaporator brackets, 
reconfigured the A/C blower system to draw air from under 
the dash and duct it to the under bus heater. The output 
from the heater was ducted back into the stock heater duct 
just behind the front beam. The entire stock heat system 
from the front beam back has been totally removed.

I get good heat and plenty of airflow....
