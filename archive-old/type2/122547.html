Subject: Re: [T2] Question about horn and windshield washer system

&gt; The horn ground 
&gt; is completed when you press the horn button on the steering wheel.
&gt; What's probably happened is the wire is frayed/brittle, and not making
&gt; proper contact when the disc turns.

That wire rotates with the steering coupler unlike the earlier design that
uses the steering tube as part of the circuit.

Check the canceling ring under the steering wheel. The later horn is wired
like so:

Starting with the (1) negative terminal of the battery and (2) frame, then
(3) steering box, there is a (4) brown wire that connects the steering box
on one side of the rubber coupler to the (5) steering column on the other
side which is &quot;electrified&quot;.

 At this point the circuit is purposefully broken by the (6) horn button
which is sitting on springs. When pressed it connects with the (7) black
wire of the canceling ring on the underside of the steering wheel which is
connected to a (8) brass ring at the base of the canceling ring. The ring
rides on a piece of (9) spring metal which keeps the canceling ring in
electrical contact in all steering positions. The spring metal is riveted to
a (10) brown wire which runs down the steering column to a (11) terminal
that interfaces with a (12) modular connector. The connector is part of a
loom that eventually spits out a (13) brown wire and it runs down behind the
fuse box, behind the kick panels into another loom where it joins the +12v
from the fuse box for the horn and exits through the floor. From here both
wires run along the underbody and terminate at boots protecting the (14)
terminals of the horn from the elements.
