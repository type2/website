Subject: Re: [T2] 2.0 oil drain plug

At 12:46 PM 8/5/2002, you wrote:

&gt;I just picked up a '79 Westy, 2.0L on Friday.  The oil
&gt;drain plug (the one to the side of the round strainer)
&gt;fell out yesterday.  Apparently the PO mechanic didn't
&gt;tighten it enough, and I didn't check it either.  I
&gt;shut the car down immediately - no harm done.  I've
&gt;plugged it temporarily with an older lug bolt from my
&gt;'69 - it goes in a few turns then stops.  I wasn't
&gt;about to torque it any further and it does drip a
&gt;little.

Be careful.  My engine (originally from an '81) came with a square-headed 
plug in it.  Apparently the hole had stripped and had been retapped to 1/2&quot; 
(or thereabouts) pipe thread.  The plug is a common hardware store item and 
it gets tight very gradually.  Seals well enough just from thread 
interference.  I'd take the time to find out exactly what you have, and 
check the threads closely for any signs of damage.  If you have a vernier 
caliper or inside mike, see if you can detect any taper to the threads 
which would indicate pipe thread.
