Hi Folks,
    Sadly, I must sell my '75 Westfalia pop top. Some details: All replaced 
in the last 2 years- all window seals, ( including scrapers on the outside), 
rear brakes, exhaust, Weber 2bbl carb ( Note: Will not pass smog test if you 
live in an area that requires it). Canvas is OK, you'll stay dry, but has 
been patched in a couple of places. Interior in good shape, cabinets look 
good, swing out table is there, as well as rear screen and childs cot. Killer 
stereo. Front door panels and kick panels are upholstered with &quot;Route 66&quot; 
fabric, but can be changed back. New rocker welded in under sliding door, 
needs other rust repair and I have some of the panels which will be included. 
Paint is OK ( Sage Green) Price $2,500.00, which is what I paid for it 2 1/2 
years ago. I also have a '76 hardtop Westy with a rusty axle beam but a good 
2.0L FI engine ( replacement axle beam included) for $500.00. If interested 
in either please email or call (703) 218-9633 and leave a message. I am 
located in Round Hill Virginia, about 15 miles west of Leesburg ( Northern 
Virginia) Thanks, Jeff
