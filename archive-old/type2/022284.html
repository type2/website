No sweat - but due to the cost of labor this would be a perfect excuse to 
buy a MIG welder and take some classes on bodywork and welding.

Simply put you cut out the old body panels with a Sawzall and angle grinder 
(with a cut off wheel on it) and then you weld in new. You leave the good 
frame members (if there is any) and you cover the holes left by your saws) 
with the new panels.

The best joints here will be butt-joints and a few lap joints. All of these 
panels are able to be ordered or fabricated.

Take it slowly - try to work along the edges of the original panels and 
drill the OEM spot welds with a spot weld cutter bit. It is a simple cut 
and replace process - sometimes small panels and sometimes big panels.

At least you've got this list.

I've helped repairing antiques where there was more rust than good car left 
over.

Clean everything and paint with POR-15. These tools can be stored in a 
closet in the house - all you need is space to work outside - a tarp tent 
can help.

Don't weld out in the rain.

Have fun and take it all one step at a time and one panel at a time.

&gt;Dear List,
&gt;
&gt;As I was replacing my shocks (soggy) my wheel cylinders (soggy) and my brake
&gt;shoes ( soggy, too) I noticed there's quite a lot of brittle, rusted metal,
&gt;hanging together as the unit formerly known as my frame.  The jack points
&gt;all collapsed with the Bilstein in them (tearing, crumbling sound).  After I
&gt;used a scissors jack and put it up securely on stands, I looked closely and
&gt;saw bubbly, cancer looking ick through out the front floor, up behind the
&gt;wheels in front and into the middle cargo area floor.  I already knew i had
&gt;cancer of the doors and bought new skins for them (to be professionally
&gt;installed...I don't know from auto body work).  Questions :  Can the
&gt;body/frame parts be bought and installed (not by me) with a safe ride
&gt;resulting? ( It will almost certainly be safer than it is now) and Is there
&gt;some action to take to prevent this from occurring again 15 years from now?
&gt;I live in Seattle, without a garage. I am the 2nd owner of this '68. I
&gt;didn't drive it for several years and this year have replaced/rebuilt most
&gt;every engine related part.  Thanks for your time and interest.  I've made an
&gt;appointment with Buffalo Restoration in Puyall, do any Puget Sound list
&gt;members know their reputation.
&gt;Thanks,
&gt;Jody
&gt;p.s.  Brakes, cylinders and shocks all working well...stopping is now crisp
&gt;and controlled :)
