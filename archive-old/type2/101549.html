Subject: Re: [T2] Calif. Emissions Laws 

Sorry for running over the cat again, but

http://www.leginfo_dot_ca_dot_gov/pub/01-02/bill/asm/ab_2601-2650/ab_2637_bill_20020927_chaptered.html

From the passed legislation, there are at least two foxes in the chicken 
coop...  Cut and pasted from above link....

   	(C) Any motor vehicle excepted by this paragraph shall be subject to 
testing and to certification requirements as determined by the department, 
if any of the following apply:

   		(i) The department determines through remote sensing activities or 
other means that there is a substantial probability that the vehicle has a 
tampered emission control system or would fail for other cause a smog check 
test as specified in Section 44012.

   		(ii) The vehicle was previously registered outside this state and is 
undergoing initial registration in this state.
