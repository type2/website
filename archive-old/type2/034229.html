Subject: greasing CV joints

Hi Volks,
   I took the cv joints out of our 71 the other day, and they're shot.
I've ordered 4 new ones and am waiting for them to arrive so I can put them 
in.
   I'm wondering if anyone has ever tried modifying a cv joint so that it 
could have new grease injected using a grease gun.  It would be so much 
easier if I could just go under with a grease gun and gease the cv joint 
while it's installed.  Well, I'll have 4 old ones to experiment with.  If I 
come up with anything promising I'll let you all know.
