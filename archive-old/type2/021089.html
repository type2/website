&gt; this year. If I have to, I guess I will have to use the super
&gt; alternator because I froze all winter long and want to get a heater

Jen:
As an electrician who's wired in a few electric furnaces, I can assure you
VW's have nowhere near the number of available watts to do much in the way of
electric heating.  TOTAL output from the Kymco is 75Amps (stock is 35 or 38),
which times 12 volts is 900 watts. About half of this is needed to run the
headlights and replenish the battery for its next start. You do the math.
Your only hope is a gas heater, which should be pretty damn clean if it's set
up right and has no leakage in the heat exchanger. BA-6's and late BN-4's
recirculate cabin air which should be free of exhaust and oil. BA-6's will
need some ducting changes to use ONLY cabin air.
Another SLIGHT possibility is one of the oil cooler heat exchangers, but at
cold temps, hot oil doesn't happen very much either.
I can understand about the original exhaust heat exchangers. Most exude some
slight oil fumes after many years use. Some people are more sensitive than
others.
