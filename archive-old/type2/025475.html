&gt; The heads were improved IMHO in Type4's. There may be other things I'm
&gt; missing, but these are the biggies that come to mind.

The fuel pump is in a different place and is driven differently, for one...
on a Type 1 engine it's on top of the engine and is driven by an eccentric
on the distributor drive; on the Type 4 it's at the front of the engine
right behind the bellhousing mating flange and is driven by a lobe on the
camshaft.

Not a big deal? Try changing one with the engine in.
