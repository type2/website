Garp- I agree..get hold of wilson's book (&quot;VW Books&quot; sell it) and sort it 
yourself if you have the time and facilities....and then you know its right 
!!. Pulling the engine takes about 1 and half hours if you're slow like me, 
and the rest depends on the state of the engine..also 1600s are cheaper to 
run in terms of parts and the engines are easier to work on from what I've 
heard. I did a complete rebuild last winter (1st time for me) and put some 
info on a webpage describing what I found and some sources of info on 
technical stuff. There is lots of help around anyway.
