Subject: RE: [T2] sheet metal

&gt; Bay window stuff shop price, most places
&gt; all carry the same stuff,



This is not the case. What's you're referring to is that most suppliers
sell Klokkerholm/Denmark sheet metal. But this is not true across the
board.

For example, California Import Parts has started selling at least some
aftermarket Brazilian sheet metal, perhaps because the Danish stuff has
gone up in price. If you search the archives there is a fairly recent
post from a list member who received a Brazilian brand from them that
even I have never heard of. I don't know if this trend will become more
widespread due to the Klokkerholm price increases that I had mentioned
before. 

We, too, sell a number of brands other than Klokkerholm - but in our
case this means higher-end brands such as genuine Volkswagen, and A.H.
Schofield or Just Kampers in the U.K.  In many cases we are the only
ones in the U.S. to offer them.  Nevertheless, you will find our prices
to be competitive with (and often lower than) other suppliers, even
though our quality is also superior.
