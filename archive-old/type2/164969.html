Subject: Re: [T2] wreck

Decide what you think is fair and dig in and don't budge, I went 2 months of refusing to negotiate on a vehicle I had just paid $10,500.00 for a few months earlier, I was offered $6,000.00, I got the $10,000.00 for it by refusing to discuss anything else.

The insurance guy would call me begging me to accept something and he would tell me that there was a vehicle just like it in the paper for much less, I told him to pick me up and we could go car shopping together, otherwise I was busy and he needed to call back with the offer for $10,000.00

You may loose your bus, it is sad, but don't let this be the final burn on you that you will regret for the rest of your life, decide what YOU think is fair, if it is keeping your bus at a given amount, decide that and stick to it.

&gt; Well, they're going to total my bus because of the relatively minor front-end damage.
