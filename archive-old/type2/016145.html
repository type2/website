&lt;&lt;I've tried another distributor, and used points and condenser.&gt;&gt; I
meant to say I use new points and condenser. 
The fuel filter was replaced about two months ago, but I'll check, and
replace 
&lt;&lt;try electrically checking the afm its in the book Hayes or Bentley,&gt;&gt;
I doubt its the afm anymore since I put two different one's on, and
still nothing. 
&lt;&lt;I look more for the nuts and bolts approach,check compression ,spark
and fuel..&gt;&gt; 
I've got spark, and fuel, and I better have compression, or I'll really
be mad, with about 9,000 miles since rebuild. All vacuum lines are where
they sould be, and no leaks. 

Thanks,
Shawn Reed
