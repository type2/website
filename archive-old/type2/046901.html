Subject: [T2] Tune-Up

Hello,

I'm doing my first complete tune-up on my bus and had a quick question.

How do you clean the non-disposable air filter?  Would you use paint thinner
or something to get all of the debris out of it?   I know this must seem
like a stupid question, but I don't want to inflict any damage on myself,
vehicle, or nearby observers!

Thanks,
