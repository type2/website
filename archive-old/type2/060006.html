Subject: aux battery draining overnight

Before I go and visit the RV place, I was curious if anyone had an
opinion/guess as to why the deep cycle Group 27 gel battery I have as a
spare on my '76 is draining overnight. Bad solenoid/not charging? Defective
battery?

It'll sit happily for nine hours _at_ 12v while I'm at work, but after 10-14
hours of sitting in the garage overnight the voltmeter reads 0v -- no such
problem before.

Thanks!
