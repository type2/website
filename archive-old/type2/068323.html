Subject: Looking For?

I am looking for a single or double cap Type 2 and was wondering if anyone
had one they would be wiling to trade for a Baja Bug. The pickup does not
have to have a good body, (not a ton of rust though) but it needs to have
a running engine. I am willing to travel throughout the southeast and
midatlantic area. I live in Knoxville TN. If you have questions about the
Baja, just send me an e-mail. It is in good shape with a rebuilt motor.
Velour interior. Wide eye Baja kit, so it doesn't look strange. Not much
rust. Was asking $1700, so looking for something about the same. Pictures
available through snail mail.

Thanks
Rick
78 Deluxe
74 Baja Bug (that's the one)
