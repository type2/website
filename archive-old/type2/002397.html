Hi everyone I have a 71 bus with a westy interior and a kit that allows you
to install a 110 h.p. dual carbs with K&amp;N AIR filters , hydralic lifters  6
cylider aircolled corvair motor with dual exhaust. sounds like a v-8 and
turns heads
  I did this conversion around 10 years ago and it totally kicks but over
the 65 h.p. motor that was always falling apart.
   This bus has been totally been gone through, several years ago I had the
whole front suspension rebuilt with all new componets. The paint is recent
and very nice , aqua green bottom ...off white top, a few months ago I spent
600.00 on all new brakes , front callipers new pads new brake hoses brand
new rear drums and new shoes , plus the vacume assist unit was not
functioning so I had a new one installed.
 The seats have been recently been reapolstered with green inserts ,black
sides and white pipping.
  The only thing that went bad on my motor in the last 10 years was that I
dropped a valve seat , so I took both heads off and all the seats re-done
and went through the entire engine it is perfection.
  This bus has a power glide automatic corvair transmission and something in
the converter or the converter seal has failed and it started pouring tranny
fluid so much that I decided to park it. I should also mention the power
glide tranny is only 1 year old and is a seperate unit from the differntial
.
  In the motor ,tranny , front end, westy interior , brakes , paint etc etc
etc ..over the years I have probably put close to 6 or 7 thousand dollars
into it.
 If you wanted to fix the tranny leak it would cost around 500.00 bucks, I f
you knew how to do it yourself it would be less.
 This bus has been in shows and is very clean, looking at it from the back
it looks totally stock , except from the dual exhaust and the sound it
produces, also the fact you can drive all day at 80 or 90 mph in the fast
lane is very cool , specially when you just fly past another bus.
   Bottom line is I dont have the time to fix it and I have a 63 corvair
convertible and a meyers manx which is also powered by a 140 hp , 4 carb
racing engine, to many cars not enough room for em all, so I need to sell
the bus.
 when there was no tranny leak I was offered 5,000.00 for it.
  the engine alone is worth 2,000.00 . Also if you wanted to make it stock
all you would have to do is remove the corvair package and install the
original power train......the corvair kit conects to all the original mounts
and suspension and cv axles are all stock.
  I f you want it with the vair equipment I will sell it for 3,000.00 or
best offer or if you want me to remove the vair motor I'll sell it for
1,800.00 either way you want to power this bus it is a clean
bus....thanks.......Keith Jensen
