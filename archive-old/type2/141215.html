Subject: Re: [T2] Window support clip broken

----- Original Message ----- 
From: &quot;dworkin&quot; &lt;dworkin_at_everybus_dot_com&gt;

&gt; So I am winding my window closed at the end of a drive.  It chatters a bit
&gt; (as it has been doing lately) and then the window falls into the door with
&gt; a &quot;thunk&quot;.  I take the panel off the door and have a look-see what is
&gt; going on.  Well, the metal clip at the bottom of the window and the tab
&gt; that connects that clip to the winder mechanism have parted welds.
&gt;
&gt; First, does anyone in/near DC have one?  Second, is the clip the same on
&gt; both the drivers and passenger side?  (If so, I have one on my spare
&gt; passenger window)  Third (hoping against hope) are the drivers and
&gt; passengers side windows *the same*????  Just flipped around?
&gt;

Hate to be the bearer of bad tidings, Steve, but you've got to replace the 
entire regulator ( winder ) mechanism, the &quot;clip&quot;, as you put it, is welded 
onto the rest of the winder mechanism, and therefore can't be replaced 
separately ( you've also got to pull the quarter window frame out to replace 
the winder mechanism.

To add to the bad news, no, the winder mechanisms are specific to each side, 
so you'll have to get another driver's window winder mechanism.

FWIW
