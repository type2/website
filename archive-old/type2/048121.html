Subject: [T2] Vanagon shift linkage wear

list:
After experiencing a growing difficulty at hitting the gears on the left
side of the gate (1 &amp; 2) on my 82 Vanagon, I think I located the
problem:
The shift linkage lever that fastens to the internal shaft on the
transaxle had some extreme wear on the plastic balls that contact the
tube that comes from the front. The upper ball had flat spots on the
sides and the lower ball had flats on the front and rear. I live in the
rust belt, so I'd guess that the metal part that rubs these may be
somewhat pitted with rust which might exacerbate the problem, but face
it , this car has 160k miles and is 19 years old. (The same part on my
80 Westy was worse!) 
So, I bit the bullet and bought 2 from my friendly VW dealer. I'm pretty
sure this is a dealer only part. Part number 251-711-219, $27.95 each. I
think it fits 1980 thru 1985 models.  I had to wait about 3 weeks,
apparently for a shipment to come from Germany. I'm pretty sure that
similar parts for bay windows are now unavailable, so I thought I'd
remind list members to check theirs and get one now while they are still
available. (Even if yours will still go into gear now, will it in 3 or 4
years?)
It has never shifted this nicely since I got it in 1991!
