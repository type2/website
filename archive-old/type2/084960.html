&gt;My second question is about the warmup procedure - the motor seems

St. Muir spake thusly:

Just let it idle slowly a minute, then a little faster to warm it quicker
but like a lamb, not a lion sort of thing.  Figure 1/2 to 3 minutes to do
the whole job right and you can contemplate your navel for the nonce,
or you can get out and look around at the tires or even read.  But this
is bread, brothers and sisters.  Do this warm-up thing and it will make
your VW last a third longer, minimum.
