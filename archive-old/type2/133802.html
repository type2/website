Subject: Re: [T2] Ball Joints Revisited

A machine shop in Berkeley charged me $15 each torsion arm to press 
out the old ball joint and press the new one in.  ($60 for all 4 
arms).

You need a special jig for T2 torsion arms, if you have a generic 
press you'll have to fabricate something that &quot;bites&quot; correctly. 
Same situation for installing Vanagon lower ball joints.

(Vanagon uppers are real easy, no special tools needed).





&gt;My Harbor Freight 20 ton press was about $160 complete with arbor plates.
&gt;However, I found it very difficult in getting just the tie rod off the ball
&gt;joint in order to install new rubber ball joint boots. I recall reports of
&gt;some shops bending presses trying to get ball joints out of torsion arms.
&gt;Some where in the achieves I read that heat was the best method of removing
&gt;ball joints Heating until cherry red and striking with a &quot;BF&quot; hammer were
&gt;terms I recall in the removal process.
