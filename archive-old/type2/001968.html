X-Diagnostic: MESSAGE REQUIRES APPROVAL

Yup I got the Bastar*d BA6 to fire up! Thankyou for all the 100's of email
responses (only 1, thanks Steve, it WAS a brown just looked red!).

Anyway a couple of tweaks required. Like a new fuel line from the pump &amp; to
splice the main fuel line in. Also need to hold the flexible exhaust pipe up
with better things than nylon zip tie's! (lasted 3 seconds). I ended up
using the OEM re-circulating fan, it just pulls air from out side (I tucked
it up near the chassis).

 I can't believe the EXTREME heat, if you have ever considered supplementary
heating, go for the BA6 (If Mr. Annoying advertiser pops his head up now I
will be pi$$ed!) it's out of the way &amp; as long as you get all the bits goes
in like a dream.

The only difficult thing is making &amp; mounting, the brackets that hold it to
the belly.

The only annoying bit was finding that I needed to make a slot next to the
main loom behind the front bumper to let the multi-plug through.

The only problem was the in-line fuse wasn't making a good connection &amp;
stalled the pump, but that was found in under 1 min, by the highly developed
skill known only to experienced engineers as FLUKE!

Just to make you all green with envy Mr Whipy now has 2 brand new GENUINE
VW, heat exchangers feeding the super-douper BA6. For those cold nights, Mr
Whipy is also equipped with a 'balanced flue' gas heater that we can use all
night. Also the full sound / heat proofing system as described on this list
is being fitted (see library, under heat).


Please send all jealous hate mail &amp; flames to:-

mrwhipy_at_yahoo_dot_com

All this just in time for Summer (DOH!)

And remember

THIS IS NOT YOUR 'Q' TO ADVERTISE EXPENSIVE NEW TYPE HEATERS.


Our baby's gonna be WARM this winter!
