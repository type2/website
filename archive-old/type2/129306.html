Subject: Re: [T2] Newly rebuilt engine wont run right

Tom,
Just because you're getting spark to each of the plugs doesn't mean that 
you're getting spark to each of the plugs at the correct time!  First 
you need to make sure that when your distributor is oriented to fire 
plug one, the engine is in the correct position to fire plug one.  This 
means that the #1 valves need to be closed and #1 is at TDC.  To find 
the firing position for #1, follow these instructions:

Quote from the Librarian:

&quot;Unless you are Superman
or otherwise possessed of X-ray vision the only way to determine when a
long-block or other unknown engine is at TDC for #1 is to remove the
right-hand valve cover and rotate the engine until you see the #1 intake
valve close.  Once you have seen that valve close then rotate the engine
another 180 degrees and you will be close to TDC for #1.&quot;

 From that point, you can use the timing mark on the pulley, or put a 
feeler in the #1 cylinder to verify that it is at TDC.  Then, you need 
to look at your distributor and see that it's in position to fire #1 
(lined up at the mark).  If it's not lined up, then you need to verify 
that the distributor drive gear was installed correctly.

If it is at the correct position, put your rotor cap on and start 
attaching wires.  Remember, 1 and 2 cross each other, 3 and 4 go 
straight to their respective cylinders.

got it?  good luck!
Mike

&gt; Hey list-
&gt; 
&gt; Im new here, and very excited to finally have someone to ask questions!
&gt; 
&gt; Ok, so here's the deal.  I have a 1973 Westfalia with a 1700, 
&gt; centermounted Weber carb, but otherwise stock.  I rebuilt it last 
&gt; summer, and have slowly been getting it going.  It runs now, but far 
&gt; from right.
