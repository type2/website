Subject: Obsessing on Dizzy, 009 timing (how far to set advance)
Message-ID: &lt;37482281.D162FEC4_at_mindspring_dot_com&gt;

Sorry to be obsessing here, but with a 2500 mile trip set to begin
tomorrow....
OK, I am beginning to resign myself to the fact that I am not going to
be able to get a stock 021 905 205P distributor for my '77 2L FI westy
in time for the departure.

So I decided to check the timing on the 009 (I hadn't as I have parked
the bus waiting to put in a new stock), it is set at 8 btdc idle, it
advances to about 34 or so at full advance.  The top of advance
&quot;bounces&quot; around a bit 30 to 34 is what I could see.

Looking at the specs on the oldvolks page that lists distributor part
numbers for every year (invaluable resource, found in the library of
type2_dot_com) I find that the stock advance is 20.5-24.5 _at_ 3400 rpm. Though
it does not list top of advance, though I would think this close.

Should I set the timing so that total advance is in the 20.5-24.5 range?
Is 30-34 too high?

If timing is set for 7.5 or so at idle, and I adjust it down so that the
advance falls in the 20.5-24.5 range, then obviously at idle it is going
to be around 1-2 or so.  This would seem fine for when I am cruising
along on the highway on this trip, but what about Friday afternoon when
I am stuck in traffic somewhere in California, and it is idling?  

Thanks again,
Scott
