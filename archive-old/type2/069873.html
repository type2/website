&gt; I read some concerns about busses bursting into flame because
&gt; of fuel lines getting old and leaky.
&gt; 
&gt; Do you have to pull the engine to get to the fuel pump (particularly
&gt; on a '69) ((no I have look myself even though I spend a lot of time 
&gt; under the bus))

On a '69 [assuming you have the 1600 upright], your fuel pump is
sitting right there on the back of the engine [Front is Front] a
little back and between the pedestal and the distributer [just follow
the fuel line and you'll find it]...no engine pulling involved.
However, if you plan on replacing all lines from the tank to the carb,
then it is definitely easier with the engine out [unless you are
smaller and more flexible than I].


&gt; 
&gt; What would have to happen in order to get a fuel line guaranteed
&gt; not to ever explode the bus, killing me and my family and everybody 
&gt; the the cars around us?  How can I inspect this?

I replaced the original VW fuel line [had been in there for 30 years]
from the tank with a stainless steel line [which should outlast the
rest of the vehicle].  Replace your rubber bits around the fuel pump
and carb with the equivalent fuel line from your local FLAPS [8mm?
... I can't remember off the top of my head] and clamp all
connections. This is sufficient for Carb engines as the fuel pressure
is low, for those with fuel injection and a touch of paranoia, you can
always use aviation plumbing [has a braided stainless steel jacket and
is pressure certified to something ridiculous...600psi?].

Hey...didn't Grandpa [aka Bob Hoover] produce a sermon on this a while
back?  Have a look in the Hoover archives
[http://www.sky_dot_net/~rmk/vw.html], I am sure that you will find
something there...

Bugs &amp; Things &amp; Splits...Oh, my!
