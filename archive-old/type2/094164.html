&gt; Did you paint it yourself?  The grey 'paint' is actually just a primer, and

No, it's the original black.  I just figured since it was Mexican it would
need repainting before long.  The last one was Mexican and ended up up like
this:

I can't tell if what I have now is a pacesetter or not but it's that style.
For future reference, how much does it cost to ship a muffler usually?  This
was pretty heavy.

&gt; will burn off rather quickly.  You can just paint over it, but the thing to
&gt; do would be having it beadblasted clean, degreased, and THEN painted.  I had
&gt; this done and the muffler looked great for years.  The Bar-B-Cue paint will
&gt; work, but it isn't intended to be used on such a rough service part.
&gt; Bar-B-Cues arent pelted with rocks and dirt.  You may want to use an
&gt; automotive paint like Krylon, PlastiKote, or VHT.

Thanks.
