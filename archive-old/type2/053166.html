Subject: FI bits for sale

I posted several weeks ago that I have a (nearly) complete FI system laying
around the shop that I don't need. I've finally taken some time to catalog
that stuff and I'd like to offer it up to anyone that might need it more
than I do. I honestly can't see myself ever re-installing this as the darn
thing just runs too nicely with carbs. I thought I had two complete systems,
but I must have pitched the first one (I was much younger, and didn't know
to keep _all_ extra parts). Anyway, a listing of the stuff I have is below.
I have no idea what this stuff is worth, I am more interested in trading it
for interesting, hard to find bits for my Westy (1976) than I am in selling
it. I'd like to get a little something for it though to cover some upcoming
work I intend to do to the Westy (re-cover front seats). So here goes:

Engine compartment wiring harness - appears complete, 2 small wires snipped
Throttle body (plenum?) - complete with mouse nest (sans mouse)
Intake runners - injectors intact, fuel lines mostly intact
Fuel pump - probably operational
Unknown electromechanical bit - 022 906 047 A (VW p/n)
Strange exhaust electromechanical thingy - 022 906 281 (VW p/n), 0588 100
007 (Bosch p/n)
Complete airbox (sans filter)
Big plastic elbow thingy
Brain - 022 906 021 AH (VW p/n), 0 280 000 170 (Bosch p/n)
Brain - 022 906 021 J (VW p/n), 0 280 000 124 (Bosch p/n)

This stuff is (most likely) off of my '76 Westy. I had a '78, but think I
pitched all of that stuff (sorry). If anyone is interested in any of this
stuff email me offline from the list. I'd like to get it out of the shop as
it only serves to increase the available mouse nesting territory.
