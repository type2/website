Hi John,

Thanks for the heads-up!

I RAN to the local big-box-bookstore this afternoon and was able to 
confirm that yes, it's my bus in the pic. Also in the picture is my 
parents white Vanagon Westy, with its complimentary red maple-leaves. 
It's the second time for my bus in that mag, but a first for my parents 
bus. Which meant I had to buy 2 copies, instead of just one.

My mom is going to be really stoked when she sees her camper in VW 
Trends.

FYI, there will be a Canadian Contingent appearance coming soon to John 
Brown's Buses, In Harpers Ferry WV from October 17-19th.
For more information, visit 
http://www.home.earthlink_dot_net/~theauchs/JBB.htm  We went last year, and 
had a very good trip.

Happy trails,

&gt; The lousy editors could have at least given you a
