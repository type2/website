It is difficult to do a proper bleed if the brakes are not all adjusted
properly.  ..Two points..I would guess that five clicks is too much to go back
on the star adjusters...I always back it up just as little as I can and still
have the wheels turn freely...I accept a very slight rubbing which will usually
disappear once the brakes shoes get in their final positions.   Second point
is....Did you adjust the front brakes, too?   Unadjusted brakes can act a lot
like air in the line.....John Jensen in Annapolis...
