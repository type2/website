Hi folks--feel my pain. I doubt they'll ever be recovered.
All of my tools were stolen from my Golf last night.

yes that 70 lb (&quot;Complete Muir Phase I and II&quot;) box is in the hands of the
local crackheads.  no roadtrips for me.

If any kind souls have extra sets of wrenches that need a home, I am in
the market for some (perhaps you have a taiwan set that you don't need
because your wife bought you those shiny new craftsmans for christmas!)
