&gt; Hey folks,
&gt;    79 Westy in need of exhaust.  Everything gone behind heat exchangers. 79,
&gt; is of course, a 79 only exhaust system. But I see in the Bus Depot catalog
&gt; that a 74 system will work, but w/ no converter.

I have a 79 2.0L 49 state engine.  The heat exchangers end at dual outlets on
each side.  My 1974 muffler bolted right up and I did not have to block off an
EGR port.
