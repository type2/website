&gt;&gt; Howdy Y'all,
&gt;&gt; First of all since this is a BUS list, here's the bus question: I 
&gt;&gt; noticed on
&gt;&gt; my '71 Westy (1600 DP) that inside the gas filler door there is a 
&gt;&gt; little
&gt;&gt; sticker that says &quot;Oktan Min. 91 ROZ&quot; I am assuming that this is german
&gt;&gt; recommending using gas with a 91 or higher octane rating (A genius, 
&gt;&gt; aren't I!)
&gt; Here's the catch... the German ROZ measurement is different than the 
&gt; system used in the US. The number comes out higher. I don't recall 
&gt; exactly why, maybe somebody else can give you a better explanation... 
&gt; but I found out after about a year of putting expensive gas in my bus 
&gt; that &quot;oktan 91 ROZ&quot; is equivilent to 85 octane over here.
