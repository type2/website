Subject: re: point gap

&gt;To GLen re. point gap:

&gt;As I understand it, the little fiber thing on the point's lever arm that
&gt;is lifted by the rotating distributor shaft's lobes wears down over time.
&gt;When it wears, the point gap becomes smaller. So a small gap is what you
&gt;would expect to get over time. I think a small gap would mean a shorter
&gt;duration spark, which would make for less complete combustion, producing
&gt;less power and poor gas mileage? Probably no lasting damage done in your case.

You're right up to a point.  Correct that the fiber cam follower wears and
the gap decreases.  When that happens the points spend more time closed,
which means the dwell is greater (52-degrees +).  But wrong that this has
anything to do with spark duration.  The plug fires the instant the gap
opens, not when it closes.

I know this may not make sense, but it really is the way the distributor
fires the plugs.  When the point gap opens there is a huge charge in the
primary winding of the coil.  That induces an even larger voltage potential
in the coil secondary.  This stuff all wants to escape the confines of the
coil so it takes the path of least resistance, through the rotor contacts
and across the plug gap.  The reason it doesn't just skip backwards across
that newly opened point gap is that Mr. Condensor won't let it go that way.


Dwell isn't very important in four-cylinder engines because there is
usually plenty of time for the coil to build up the charge.  It's more
critical in something like an eight-cylinder monster because a single
degree can mean a high percentage of decrease in time when the coil is
allowed to build up the charge in its potential winding.  And of course it
shows up as firing trouble usually at high engine speeds when the time to
charge that coil winding gets really short in terms of real seconds, not
just degrees of rotation.

The reason we VW tuners have to worry about wear on that little fiber
follower is that it changes the timing, retards it as the wear makes the
dwell greater.  So the actual fuel burn starts later as the points wear.
It's easy enough to imagine what happens when you get a short time to push
on the top of a piston that is attached to a crankshaft.  If you push too
soon or too late some of your energetic push will be lost.  If you push
just at the right time you'll give that heavy crankshaft a real spin.
