Got the top back yesterday from the 71 resoration from hell. I posted the
paint codes to see if it was right and no one responded. :-(

Went with cloud white, and does not look right but I love it. Kinda off -
white. Beautiful. Two coats of epoxy primer then top coat and then three coats
clear. I love it. Get the bumpers back next week, will be same color.

I wet sanded the thing first, to remove lichens, paint, etc.... then renforced
all the fiberglass around the wood. Solid baby. 

If you do this, better hope some PO painted the thing at some point. Really
protected the fiberglass.

Peace,

Ric
