Subject: pop top compatibility

Hi, I am considering replacing my not so pretty pop-top with one advertised
for sale that sounds to be in great shape. The owner says he thinks it is
from a 74 westy wheras mine is a 78. I am under the impression that they are
the same from 72 to 78. Is this so? If not I will not bother driving out to
check it out. Bob
