Subject: Re: [T2] bilge blower heater retrofit - was: Oil cooler as heat

&gt; &gt; Only a week ago I installed 2 of the 3&quot; Atwood blowers in the engine
&gt; &gt; compartment. I mounted them to the ceiling on each side and extended the
&gt; &gt; heater hoses from the doghouse.
&gt;
&gt; Since you're doing all this replumbing, why not create a vent behind the
&gt; spare tire (like the ones on the gas heater equipped buses) and plumb this
&gt; to the inlet of your bilge blowers?  That way you get recirculation.


Yeah, I think a vent is a good idea. It would also avoid the risk of pulling
too much air away from the engine, as Don pointed out. I'm refinishing the
interior with wood soon and will work some vents in.
