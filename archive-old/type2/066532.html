Du hast recht! Es war doch ein &quot;Full sized school bus.&quot;
Esta correcto! Eta pravda! You are right, sir!

But it set the pace for hippie, tricked-out buses, from &quot;Urge&quot; (the VW bus
in the story that runs through the original edition of The Whole Earth 
Catalog) on down through the Partridge Family's ride (The Merry Pranksters
sanitized for your protection by primetime TV) to those wild full-sized
hippie buses you still occasionally run across at hot springs and such places. 
I think a folk decorated Westfalia is the direct cultural descendant of
these colorful vehicles. 

In fact, the full-sized-school-bus-gone-hippie-bus tradition still lives. 
At a remote CA hotspring, I saw a full sized bus meticulously, lovingly
overhauled into a purple and wood mobile home/mural of striking hippie beauty. 
Houseplants, comfy chairs, leaded crystal windows on the wooden doors, 
beautifully varnished wooden brightwork everywhere ornamented with 
decoupaged pictures of people and places, shag carpet, tie-died and batiqued
tapestries, fringed curtains, the works. The center of every hubcap was a 
golden star with painted spokes as if it were a circus wagon or a gypsy caravan.
I heard Nancy Griffith singing old folks songs on the stereo, and caught a waft
of sandalwood incense on the air when a 40-something guy with Jesus-hair in
balloon pants and a colorful vest called to me from inside, &quot;Come on in, 
brother...&quot; It's an elegant way of life not often seen today. They had not 
restored this vehicle so much as transformed it. I was impressed.  

They continued the motif on a VW bug with a welded-on luggage rack, very
hand done collage paintjob, golden stars over the tail lights, flowers
on the antenna, lizards romping over the fenders, cherubs on the running boards.
The bug served as Shuttlecraft to the big bus's Mothership.

There are other traditions of folk decorated vehicles of course. Mexican 
buses and trucks come to mind as one example. But I think Ken Kesey's bus 
was a particularly influential example that a lot of people in America 
took to heart when they decided to personalize their VW's. Most of us can't
afford to do the full-on school bus trip,or maybe we're just not quite that 
counterculture but a VW bus is The People's Bus, and some people love those 
things to bits, decorating them on a less epic scale, but with equal love and 
attention to funky detail.

I wonder if heavily folk-decorated VW buses were ever common in Germany.
There's such a straight-laced, conservative streak there, but also a very
strong ultra-liberal backlash against the  cultural hardline.
Anyone have any information about hippie buses in the Vaterland?
