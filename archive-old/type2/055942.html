Subject: Fuel tank filler neck hose

Hi Volks,
With the engine out of the Turtle to replace the clutch, I decided to take
off the panel hiding the gas tank to take a look and make sure the sender
wires were secure and see the overall condition of stuff.  With the fiery
demise of my 68 bus 10 years ago in my mind, I decided to replace the 60mm
hose connecting the filler neck to the tank, but so far I haven't found one.
It looks in OK shape actually.  Am I wasting my time being paranoid or are
there any ideas out there. I haven't visited the VW dealer yet but even if
they had such a thing would it be 40 bucks for a 7 inch hose? Tanks all.
