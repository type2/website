Subject: Re: [T2] Hooking up brake servo w/ Dual Webers

Listen, man. I'm about to upgrade to Weber 40 IDF's.
I've gotta ask you:
1. What size venturis did you get? (Your's IS a 1700?)
2. What the hell is a brake servo and how does it have
anything to do with the carburators?

Sorry to be asking stupid questions, but really, I had
no idea!

&gt; Hello,
&gt; 
&gt; I have a '72 Westy and I recently upgraded the carbs
&gt; 
&gt; from stock to a set of Weber 40 IDFs.  After hooking
&gt; 
&gt; everything up, I noticed that there wasn't any way
&gt; to 
&gt; connect the brake servo vacuum hoses.  Oddly, I've
&gt; never 
&gt; heard this problem come up before.  But now that I'm
&gt; 
&gt; faced with it, I'm stumped.  
&gt; Am I looking at having to drill and tap my new
&gt; manifolds 
&gt; for the new hookup?  If so, I'd like to know the
&gt; proper 
&gt; placing of it on this new style manifold. 
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks in advance for any help!
