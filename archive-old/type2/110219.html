Subject: oils

So i have gotten a great deal of jabber about oils, but nothing solid to base 
my decision on, are there any engine builders online that have worked with 
different oils and choose one to run more than others. Someone said 10w30 for 
the first break in, I have only used straight 30w in some older engines, and 
seemed to work fine but did not have any temp gauges to get exact readings. thanks
