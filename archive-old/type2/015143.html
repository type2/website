Subject: '71 Westy, reluctantly for sale
Mime-Version: 1.0

Hello all;

I've been off the list for a while, so I hope this message doesn't violate
any new protocols.  I have a nice '71 which got a new lease on life due to
this list.  It started out as a '69 restoration project, got a new engine,
shocks and some wiring stuff, and so on.  When I got around to exploring
options for bodywork, the project all of a sudden got a whole lot larger.

So I bought a '71 with a nice body and terrible everything else and started
swapping parts.  The rebuilt '69 engine went into the '71, the new KYB's
swapped, the '71 got new brakes and (thank you Bus Depot) a shiny new
rebuilt steering box.  Next came new canvas for the top, and a non-original
two-tone paint job (beige over navy).  Once it got driveable, campable, and
presentable, it went into use and I haven't had time since for the
interior, what with all the trips and camping.  Then, surprise!  I got
engaged.  She's a camper, but we'll need some other stuff first, so I'm
going to part with the Westy. 

So here's what you get:  '71 WF, strong '69 motor (no leaks, no fumes!),
shiny paint on a straight body, brakes, shocks, steering, new canvas on
top, child's cot.  The shortcomings; medium interior, front seats worn out,
some headliner sag, naugahyde on mattress, no canvas on upper cot, no
radio, no appliances (I've actually liked it better with a Coleman stove
and cooler; you can move them around when you need to fill the bus with
bikes and stuff).

I'm asking $2,550 'til I find out whether that's way high or way low.  You
can e-mail me at 1trader_at_airmail_dot_net, or if you're pretty serious, call me
at 817-882-9986.  I know this is a big list, so be gentle with me ;-)
It's in Fort Worth, TX.
