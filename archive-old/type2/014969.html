So with much swearing, grunting, and absorption of gasoline and motor oil,
Rob and I manage to extract the engine from my '77 Westy and figure out the
location of the Last Two Screws cleverly hidden at the bottom corners of
the firewall, and by dint of sheer persistence remove the old, rusty fuel
tank. Its newly installed replacement goes in without too much grief, and
with darkness closing in, we attempt to connect the fuel filler neck to the
tank.

I am relieved to discover, after all the horror stories I've heard about
this troublesome piece of rubber, that it's in pretty good shape.
Unfortunately, in the limited time remaining, we can't seem to get the
thing connected. Muir doesn't discuss this sort of thing beyond
recommending a qualified mechanic. Bentley mentions it only obliquely under
the general heading of, &quot;to install, reverse the steps&quot;, which
backreferences to &quot;disconnect the fuel filler neck.&quot;

Before I risk damaging this precious piece of polymer this coming weekend,
I thought I'd ask the list and see if there's a &quot;trick&quot; that experienced
persons might know.
