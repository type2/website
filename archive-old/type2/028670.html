	After several months of lurking and reading the archives, I find myself in
need of the expertise of the list.  I have a chance to pick up a '78 Westy
Poptop for very little cash outlay less than 20 miles from home.  As far as
I know, the '78 is solid and has a comeplete interior, but no engine.  I
currently have a '72 Hardtop with a '73 1700cc w/ dual Webbers.  I would
like to drop the'73 engine into the '78 chassis, but don't know if there
would be any issues with compatability of engine tin, tranny, gas tank
(assuming the 78 had FI) etc.  Please let me know what to expect if I decide
to undertake this project.

Thanks in advance,
Jay Brown
