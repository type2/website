Just explored that same question on our '81 Vanagon. It turned out to
be bad connectors on the wires that go to the starter. Check them out.
If they look old, corroded, slightly melted (as ours did) replace them.
Your local FLAPS should have the sizes you need. The van had the same
symptoms as yours, and began to start and charge normally after these
connectors were replaced. Also check the wire form the battery to the
starter. Replaced mine when the engine was replaced. Hope this helps.
