&gt; The bus will idle with the AFM disconnected. It's a relatively smooth

That's normal if the plug is disconnected.

Ug.
 
&gt; I connected a vacuum gauge to the manifold and was able to read 18&quot; of
&gt; mercury in while running without the AFM. My (insert plug for
&gt; GermanSupply_dot_com here) VDO fuel pressure gauge reads 40 PSI and the new
&gt; oil pressure gauge reads close to 4 Bar. (approx 68 psi).

The oil pressure sounds good. The senders aren't very good but they at least
read low.

That fuel pressure gauge is either reading incorrectly or you're not getting
any vacuum on the fuel pressure regulator (or it's broke). The fuel pressure
should be about 36-37 psi and 28 psi with the vacuum attached. That's your
source of richness.

&gt; As far as I can tell there are really only 2 other components to test:
&gt; The double relay and the wiring harness. Everything else seems to work
&gt; OK, or would not cause the current symptoms. I don't think the double
&gt; relay could cause this problem anyway.  We probably could have tested
&gt; my double-relay on Collie's bus too but he had a dinner to get to.

I wouldn't rule out the AFM.
