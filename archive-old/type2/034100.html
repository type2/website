also is anybody doing anything
&gt; nifty to get their fuel line through the front tin over the
&gt; tranny-somebody suggested a metal pipe through the grommet. wasnt
&gt; sure
&gt; if that was necessary or not.

Depends upon if you like engine fires or not!

Some use the &quot;Hoover fitting&quot; made up from the threading tubing and
nuts common in lamps.  Some are just sure to install a new grommet
every time they pull the engine.  I prefer to cut a strip of inner-tube
rubber about 2 inches wide and 10 inches long.  Wrap the strip round
and round the fuel line until it is just a bit bigger than the hole in
the tin.  Cut off the excess.  Now shove the rolled strip through the
hole in the tin.  This is quite durable and gives plenty of warning
before failing.  Cheap too.

&gt; the place that did my rebuild is saying
&gt; only to torque lower head bolts after 300 miles. i know the archives
&gt; address this but still wondering what certain people are saying...

VW always asserted that torquing in not needed.  They certainly didn't
make it easy in any case.  Outside opinions are varied on this.  I
haven't seen anyone suggest torquing only the bottom bolts and I feel
that this would not be such a good ideal.  You can certainly _check_
the torque on the lower bolts, but if they are loose, be prepared to
pull the engine and set things right on the top and bottom.
