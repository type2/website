Subject: [T2] weber progressive 2bbl. How to make it work 4 me!

Hi there all, Does anyone know how to make these
webers run smoother? I have a 79' westy, wich
regretfully the p/o. had replaced the F.I. w/ the
weber prgressive 2bbl. carb:( Is this thing junk or is
it just me? I've never owned a carbuerated vehicle
that ran so Sh!!!y. Below 2000 rpm its useless,
especially when cold or cold outside. How do I check
the jatting? What are you other folks using for jet
sizes? I live in Iowa. My mechanic told me I need to
go w/ a dual carb setup. Wich makes sense, the older
type iv engines had dual carbs, w/ smaller displacment
engines. Any advice would totally be appreciated.
Stranded in Iowa.
