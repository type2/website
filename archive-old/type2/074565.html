&gt; &gt; WHAT dealer?????   I have been looking for a long time and my dealer has
&gt; &gt;  it listed as NLA

&gt; I got my Type IV thermostat a couple of months ago at Burnsville Volkswagen, 
&gt; Burnsville, Minnesota.  Phone number 952-894-3500.  I had to order it since 
&gt; it is not stocked at the dealership but it was in in a couple of days.

I only live a dozen miles or so from the VW Lanham wharehouse which is the
main distribution center for the entire USA

I could drive down there in 45minutes
