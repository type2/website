Subject: Re: [T2] Headliner Install

You can do it if you want to read up and try.... I've done a couple with good results. My first had flaws. My second had fewer flaws, etc. 

Look around on the web for websites done by enthusiasts that explain how to put any headliner in. The concept will be the same. Seems like I saw a good one for a Beetle one time long ago. 

Buy a million of those little paper clip clamps. Black with chrome levers that fold back. I tried it with clothes pins with no luck. Not enough clamping force.
