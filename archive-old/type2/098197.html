Subject: Re: [T2] my engine goes *POP*, help please

[...]Sounds like it's time to go back to basics, check
your valve clearnce, TDC pulley, tizzy on #1,wires
going to the right places, Points set to .016. The
starter does roll the engine over? The engine was
rolling over when it popped? All you did was replace
the heads, so the distrubtor drive should not be out
of place. On the coil +(15) hot wire and choke, -(1)
condenser wire &amp; tac.  Good luck Phil
