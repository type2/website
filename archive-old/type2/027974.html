Bringing the Riviera back Saturday was interesting, to say the least. I found that after only 14 years of sitting, the brakes had decided to stay tight. Well dude and I got her to roll with the help of a wrecker truck and a bug (bug wasn't *much* help) and I thought the wheels were all free. And they were free-wheeling, but not without surface.

The brakes were only slightly engaged, creating some drag, but not enough to keep the Buick from towing the bus. It wasn't until I got on the Interstate and realized I couldn't go over 55 that I knew I had never totally freed the brakes; after all, I figured I was just getting rust to break loose. I drove about 5 miles and then pulled over to feel the wheels; they were getting hot, as I had feared. I went about 10 miles more, looking for a good place to stop--blood sugar dropping; needed food.

When I stopped, I found that the front brakes seemed to be the worse, but I couldn't pull the front wheels without disconnecting from the tow bar and I forsaw much time being spent there, trying to solve that one problem while my wife and childrens were home with a hacking cough, driving one another crazy--I am actually the calming force at such times. No, *really*, I am!

In the end, I decided to loosen some brake line fittings; first one at the master cylinder; a little squirt and then drip drip drip. Then I backed off on the passenger side front bleeder valve. Hot brake fluid shot out of there like a pressure cooker! I ran to the trunk of the Buick and got my fire extinguisher, but I didn't need it. That's when I realized, the heat from the rubbing brake pads made the fluid hot, compressing the brakes more and more. So that's why I used almost 1/4 tank in only 15 miles.

I left the bleeder valve loose along with the line to the rear brakes. I drove home without further incident.

Thanks! Joe
