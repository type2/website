&gt; &gt; Glad the repair worked out for you!
&gt; &gt; BTW, where did you find that aluminum magnet?  :)

&gt; Oops had a memory hick-up, I'd remembered using a magnet but i forgot
&gt; that it didn't work :) doh. What I did use was the vacuum again. Here is
&gt; what I did. First I attached a bendable drinking straw to the vacuum
&gt; tube...

Another approach if you have compressed air:

Fashion an extension for the blowgun of 1/8 brass tubing (hobby store.
Put a nearly right angle bend in the tubing, but make sure that you can
snake the tubing through the spark plug hole.  Put the tubing in the spark
plug hole and hit the button.  While blowing, swivel the thing around 360
degrees to make sure that you hit everywhere.

Wear safety glasses, as the nasty stuff will come out the spark plug hole!
