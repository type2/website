&gt; I notice that some of the remanufactured calipers for the 1971 model

I think that the purpose of having two bleeders is to allow the caliper to
be used on either side of the vehicle.  As long as the bleeder is at the
top of the piston as installed, I don't think that you will have any
problem.
