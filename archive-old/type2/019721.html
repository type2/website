&gt; Fabrication, as I mentioned, yeah a hassle to cut out the AFM support

I just used large telephone company size wire ties to the curved brackets for
the fresh air tube up the right side in my 74 FI conversion.  Tempory to start
with, too lazy to fix since it seems to work just fine.

&gt;  but most people on this list would be as able to get a FI up
&gt; and running as a set of '72-'74 carbs.

The FI is far easier to set up and maintain.  Just my opinion folks.
