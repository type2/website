&gt;Now you can see I am NOT a technical expert on anything drivable.
&gt;Is it ridiculous for me to try to get this bus which may or may not have
&gt;a good engine and trust my brother (who is a BMW-VOLVO freak)?
&gt;He has advised against this because I am single and wants me to have
&gt;dependable transportation for myself and my girls.

If you were my sister I'd try to make you get a Toyota. But you aren't. So
I say, go for it! ;)

Don't shut it off until you get it home, then you can start to diagnose
what is probably a problem in the fuel injection system, not the engine
itself. We're here if you need us. There are several books you'll have to
buy.

If you decide not to get it, please tell us where it is. There are several
wannabussers here who might jump at this bus at this price.
