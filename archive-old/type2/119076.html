Subject: RE: [T2] case splitting tool

It all depends.... Factory stock or correctly built, yes. But when some
bright soul uses hardening aviation permatex 1 on the case halves and oil
pump, you'll break a oil pump puller....Then bend  a case splitter....

SO....then, in hindsight, you have to solvent dip the whole darn block...

Case in point, sometimes you do need a case splitter.... But not usually..

Al, having bad luck or none at all...


I've never needed anything other than my own two hands and sheer
determination (to find every last fastener).  :-)
