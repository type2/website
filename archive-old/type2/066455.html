 How many miles are on the

I think maybe forever.  Die Frau is up to 289K, looks like hell, and always
starts.  She's on her 3rd engine rebuild, original (to my knowledge--I
bought her at 76K) tranny, 2nd set of ball-joints, etc.  As far as I know
the starter is original, and we're at alternator no. 2 and maybe the
gazillionth muffler.

This winter I hope to start replacing some of Frau's rustiest body
panels--it will be the second time for some of them, too.

These old beasts are built like iron!  Of course, the people who keep
them going are obsessed &amp; slightly whacko, too.
