Subject: bone yards in North Carolina
To: type2_at_type2_dot_com

Hello list,

I have a question for those listees living in North
Carolina. Do any of you know of any good bone yards in
North Carolina that have a good selection of old
busses to pick from? Or are there any vw junk yards in
North Carolina? I am preferably looking for one in the
eastern half of NC but any in North Carolina will do.
Any help would be appreciated!

Thanks!
