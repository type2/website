Subject: oil pressure gauges
Date: Fri, 13 Nov 1998 02:35:36 PST

Hey Y'all,
  I have a 70 Bus and I want to put a oil pressure gauge in it. I have 
the gauge out of my Bug, but I don't have a long enough hose to make the 
connection. The FLAPS only sell a hose setup for non-VW's, where the 
engine is in the front so the hose is only 6-8ft long. Its a long way 
back to the engine on the Bus. I know others have done this so where do 
you get the long hose and what length is it? I only need the hose and 
ferels.
