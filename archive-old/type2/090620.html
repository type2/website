Subject: Re: [T2] 914 exhaust system questions What system would be best???

Hello List,

Thanks for your thoughts on my exhaust question
regarding my 914 2.0L. I have broke down and decided
to buy an exhaust settup that is made for this engine.
The system that I ordered is not stock but it will
probably be more suited for my engine than the 1.7 bus
exhaust that I have. Here is a link to the exhaust.

Instead of using a cat. with it, I ordered their cat
replacement pipe. 

Anyhow, thanks for the link to this awsome sight. Have
a great day!

David Kelly

&gt; 
&gt; Do a google search for Porche 914 club and see if
&gt; you can find a
&gt; &gt;forum. Maybe someone there can give you specs to
&gt; help. Sorry I can't be
&gt; &gt;of more help.
&gt; 
&gt; Good technical articles that we can apply to our
&gt; VW's too.
