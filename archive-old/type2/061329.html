 &gt; this consists of a female bulkhead plate which is installed

 &gt; via the removeable (male) threaded plug which also is &quot;O&quot;
 &gt; ring sealed. These come in plastic or metal. Dont worry to much

 RE my previous message: 1.I know YOU know the vanagon fuel tank's in
 front but a previous message made itr sound like someone didn't know.
 2. I don't think 68's have that cover over the tank that you're
 referring to as the firewall-68's have a lot of differences from later
 years.
