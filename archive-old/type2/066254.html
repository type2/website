Subject: Milan, Michigan 7/28 Bug-Out Caravan

Hi there everyone,

        the Milan, Michigan Bug-Out is this Sunday, July 28.  If you're in
the area, come join the caravan to the show departing from Arborland Mall
in Ann Arbor.  Arborland is at westbound exit 37 (Washtenaw Ave.) of US23;
the time to meet is 8:15-8:30 right at the base of the big Arborland sign.
Email me for more directions if you need them.

        Caravners will include (at the very least):

        Eric, '71 Sportsmobile
        Judy, '72 Convertible
        Mitch, '70 Karmann Ghia
        Mark, '62 Kombi
        Dan Z., '65 Beetle
        Dan B., '62 Beetle
        Matt, '67 Bus
        Jack, '63 Beetle
        Gordon, either a '58 Single Cab or a '71 Beetle
        Greg &amp; Emily, '71 Squareback
        ...and don't forget &quot;a guy from Okemos who has a late model 'vert.&quot; :)

We can also expect to have other VWs fall in line en route to the show;
it's great fun to watch the caravan grow.  It makes people's heads spin as
they drive by a dozen air-cooled VWs tooling down the highway!  The weather
forecast is *perfect* for this weekend:

        SATURDAY...DRY. LOWS IN THE 50S. HIGHS IN THE 70S.
        SUNDAY...DRY. LOWS IN THE 50S. HIGHS IN THE 70S.

Just the same, Eric &amp; Mark are bringing their drive-away Westy tents so
we're sure to stay dry if it rains and stay cool if the sun decides to bake
us.


See you Sunday, bright &amp; early!
- -Greg
