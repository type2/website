Subject: Re: [T2] Wobbly rear tires.

In a message dated 3/7/03 8:31:16 PM, tmlist_at_tsioregon_dot_net writes:

&lt;&lt; Wife was following me home this evening and noticed that the rear tires

seemed to be &quot;wobbling&quot; upon closer inspection the right rear tire had a

lug nut loose. She says the left tire is far worse then the right.


Now I'm sure I tightened the hell out of these when I did the brakes last.

Any ideas?

Some solutions (or at least reasonable guesses) depend on the year of 
your bus.
