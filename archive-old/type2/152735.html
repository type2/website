Subject: Re: [T2] heated clothing

In my more carefree days, a long time ago in a galaxy far, far away, in
addition to driving Type 2s all over, I also chose to ride and tour on a
H*nda GL1100 Interstate.  Widder was and still is a very popular,
quality outfit when it comes to heated gloves, vests, jackets, chaps, pants,
socks, etc.  Been using their products for aeons.  Now that I drive a Type 2
with a REAL heater, I don't use them as often tho....

&gt; I was at the motorcycle show in Toronto Canada this weekend... and came
&gt; across a company with heated clothing...  http://widderca_dot_com
&gt; The sales guy said they can sew the heaters into what every you want...
&gt; seats.. pants... so if you can't find an off the shelf item.. ask them
&gt; about custom ideas you may have.
&gt; I am not affiliated with this company at all..
&gt; I just found it interesting.
