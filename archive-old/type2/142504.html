&gt;Hi Guys.  I walked through the den a couple of nights
&gt;ago and a COPS rerun was on.  The police were trying
&gt;to calm down a greasy man in an absolute panic.

That's no way to be talking about our listmembers! :-)

&gt;Turns
&gt;out he had been working on his bus and had a gas line
&gt;loose.  He turned it over and WHAM.  It caught on fire
&gt;and it caught the house on fire that he was backed up
&gt;against.  He kept going on and on about how stupid it
&gt;was that he forgot that gas line.  And he burned his
&gt;best friend's house down!  The blaze was really
&gt;roaring.  Total loss of the bus and the house. 
&gt;Anybody else catch that episode?

I hate that show but that's one I'd like to see.
