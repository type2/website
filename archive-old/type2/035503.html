Subject: Baywindow in QVC commercial

Hey all,

QVC ran a commercial (on another channel) w/ a baywindow bus the other
night.  The premise was that the Quality Asurance manager for QVC drives
the bus daily because it is so dependable!!  He stated that he had over
700K on his bus!  It was a slate blue passenger bus 76-79 I believe.

I was in shock!  The commerical kept talking about how this guy checked
out all the products that QVC sells and it had to pass his quality
mark.  And the whole time it kept flashing to his sweet bus!!!

keep an eye out!

michael
