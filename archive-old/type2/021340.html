Subject: Another Fuel Line Warning

So, I've been working on Wunder, and kinda hating it and being
impatient, and knowing that I still should get those fuel lines
replaced...

Took off to fetch a trailer today...  'Bout halfway thru my journey I
think I smell fuel, jam down the heater levers to get a really good
whiff.  Pass one exit.  This little voice sez, HEY, IDIOT, YOU KNOW
BETTER!

Sure 'nuff, the line on #1 injector is spraying out a really nice cloud
of fuel.

AAA (my special friends, get their PLUS service now!), and $160 bucks
later I had my new fuel lines, thanks to the GOOD people at Redman in
Gilroy.

Replace your lines!  Save some money!

But this was a GREAT day.  The way I figger, the reason the durned
trailer I needed was in Gilroy, was the shop to do it right and let me
bs with them and watch was there...  They were really good folks that
helped to restore a bit of faith in shops for me...  Things DO happen
for a reason.  

It looked like an ugly little job and it was much more fun to sit there
with a burger and chat.  ;-)

Good justification, eh?

Jamie, the hitch is fantastic!

Teri
