Subject: R&amp; R of '75 bus exhaust
To: Air Cooled Bus List &lt;type2_at_type2_dot_com&gt;

Hi 
I'm helping my son repair the exhaust on his bus so he can get a
sticker and drive again. We removed the exhaust on my his '75 camper
and found that the flanges on the elbows which connect the exhaust
header to the heat exchangers are bowed creating a 1/16&quot; gap in the
middle. I'm sure this happened because the heat exchanger support was
broken and the resultant movement of the heat exchangers caused the
flanges on the elbows to distort. In addition to this one of the head
studs holding the the header was found to be broken flush with the head
(old damage). 

FLANGES: 
I'd appreciate any suggestions on how to seal or repair the flanges to
obtain a good seal. 
Can I hammer the flanges straight without damaging them? 
Can I use JB weld to repair them?
Is it best to use the metal or fiber based gaskets?

STUD:
I  attempted to remove the old broken stud by drilling a pilot hole and
using an easy out. I drilled the first 1/8&quot; hole off center and then
added insult to injury by drilling a second hole the same way on the
other side of the stud. Any suggestions on how to remove the stud
(preferrably without removing or replacing the head) would be greatly
appreciated. 
What happens if I reinstall the header with only three studs?
What about replacing the other rusty studs? Is there a trick to
removing them without breaking them or should I leave them alone? 
 Am I screwed? 

Gary
