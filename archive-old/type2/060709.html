Roland _ Sorry, sorry, sorry.

I did not read your message before I made my post on the 3 shops.

I did not mean to disparage Sears gauge.  I saw two gauges at Sears, one
was a bubble in a T-square, with a tiny adjustable angle measure in the
center.  I could not conceive how this would get me within a degree of
my measurements.

The other gauge was a 6 inch sized, white faced pendulum style gauge.  I
also did not seem sensitive enough, since it just jumped (not smooth)
about the scale as I looked at it.

Again, I appreciate your post and comments, and I apologize to you for
my flip remark about Sears products. I should not have said such, even
if I did not receive your post.

  fine to take it to someone else if you want to.  to answer your three
  problems:

  Sears sells a good angle measurement device for aroung $10 that will
  come in handy for you in the future too.  With it you don't have to
  level your bus, just read the angle and compensate in the calcs.  I
  can read mine to a half degree with a little care, and maybe to 20
  seconds.
   
 
  I hope that the guy you find to do the work will be as careful in it
  as you are.
