Subject: fuel line shutoff valves

A friend of mine has a performance car place called
Muscle Car Northwest Inc./ Renton, Wa. ... I talked
with him a while ago and this is where he pointed
me....
http://www.earlyhemiparts_dot_com/hilborn-shutoff-valves.shtml
Note the cable hook up for these valves.. he advised
that
they mount these as close to the gas tank outlet as
possible and then run a cable control up to the dash.
If they mount it after a fuel pump they use the 
3 way valve.. this way you can stop the fuel flow to
the engine but if you pull it and forget to turn off
the
key and the fuel pump is running you wont fry the
fuel pump running it dry. Not sure how you would run
the return line to the tank on a bus tho.
