Subject: Re: [VB] Re: [T2] Oil pressure blues

I have to agree. There is a certain light near the studio where I often
have to make a quick stop while the engine is still cool and I can get the
oil light on occasionally. Actually I can pretty much guess my oil level
from how it behaves. It funny because there are stops before and after and
I kind of tinker with the idea that when the oil is thick it doesnt move
fast enough to starve the tube, when its warm it flows back quick enough
to not make a difference...Then theres the 'tween time.

OK. Ill be checking into the Asylum now....
