&lt;&lt; Guys, I swear that the ones I worked on back in the mid 70's were
shiny side up from the factory.

Cheers, dave

DM says seals installed at the factory on Mon/Tues were shiny side up.
Wed seals were optional (as long as it was a month with a 'r' in it, other
wise reverse).
Thurs/Fri seals were shiny side down.
Sat (after a long nacht at the biergarten), seals were lucky to be in-
stalled...
