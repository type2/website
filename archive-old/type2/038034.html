Subject: 78 Westy Automatic for sale

I'm looking for someone who needs and will care for an automatic camper.
It had 35,000 miles registering on the odometer when we bought it in Jan
1987. (This was inaccurate but it gives a benchmark for my subsequent
readings.

Paid $3000 for replacement engine in June 93 at 79,000
New heads ($1500) in June 1998 at 123,000
Alternator in 97 ($300), battery ($60) in 98, fuel pump &amp; brakes in 99
($550). Have receipts. Has Westphalia interior in good shape; good
canvas pop-top.

Currently running nicely. I have retired and have bought a Vanagon. (My
4th camper, my 7th V. W. People don't wave at me anymore, but I enjoy
the refridge and heater warmth!)

Current mileage is 132,600. Needs an owner who will do paint work from
effects of coastal weather. Asking $2900.
