Hey All,
Thanks for all the information. Having been heavily involved in for a number
of years with another type of vehicle (land Cruiser) I know how long it take
to wrap you brain around things, and so I appreciate your patience and help.

Here's the biggest question...the kicker:

Can I expect that a type 2 in good running order will make it form my
temporary home here in Fresno to my house back in DC?  In November?  Or
should I just let my little Toyota pickup tow it back?  Or bring the tow bar
and drive it when it runs- tow it when it doesn't?

TIA
Rob Blumel

Hey Rob,

I bought a 1972 Type II transporter this Spring, 7 seater, walk-through,
blue/white, deluxe trim.  I have learned a lot about this bus since this
time.

There is much information available on the web (http://www.type2_dot_com for
starters), newsgroups (rec.autos.makers.vw.aircooled, and list services.

These are the things that I have learned:

--Rust is the real enemy.
--Be sure the fuel lines are in good condition.
--These busses are easy to fix and fun to work on.
--These busses will need work all the time.  Keep your tools in the bus with
you.
--Parts are amazingly available, but mainly from web and mail order.  I have
found little available from local auto part stores.  There are a couple of
aircooled repair shops that sell me parts when I need them if they have
them.

I have found out that there are two basic designs of busses, 1967 and before
(big &quot;V&quot; shape in front) and 1968 and after.  Up until 1971, the bus had the
same engine that a bug had.  In 1972, the bus got a new engine, a Type IV
&quot;pancake&quot; engine that had more power (a whopping 68 hp).  This is the same
engine that was in the Porsche 914.  It is more expensive that the older
engine to buy parts for, but still very economical in comparison to anything
watercooled.  There is a huge aftermarket for the older Type I engines, but
all you need for the Type IV engine can be found.

The major differences that come to mind are:
--The engine case is aluminum instead of magnesium.
--The cooling fan is bolted to the crankshaft instead of belt driven.
--The head design is different.
--it came standard with a twin solex carburator setup.
--The cooling system is different, better design, I think.
--The oil cooler is located in a better position.
--There is a regular type of oil filter that can be replaced along with the
screen filter.
--There is nothing cross-compatible between the two different types of
engines.

I bought the Muir book and the Bentley book.  These and my computer tell me
all I need to know, so far.

In 1971, the bus got front disk brakes, so the 1972 has vacuum assisted
front disk brakes.  I have done major brake work.  I replaced the rear wheel
cylinders (about $12 each) hardware, flexible brake hoses, shoes.  I have
rebuilt the front calipers, replaced the hardware, rotor, pads, flexible
hoses.  My bus stops very well.  This was a lot of work.

I replaced the fuel pump (very expensive, $130) because it was leaking
gasoline on the exhaust system (very dangerous).  I replaced the starter
because it died.  All this was pretty easy to do.  I did these two jobs in
about 2 hours.

My bus is fun to drive around.  It could probably go 80 MPH if I had the
nerve to go that fast, it cruises fine at 65-70.  It will slow considerably
on a hill (going up).  It is ideal around town or on old slow country roads,
but can also hang on the interstates.  It is loud to drive, hard to talk at
highway speeds.  You feel and hear everything going on in the engine, etc.
There is a good article on the type 2 website about sound proofing a bus.

The suspension is torsion bar type like the standard beetle.  The rear has a
true independent type suspension (the rear wheels go straight up and down,
instead of swinging up and down).  The bus did not get an automatic until
later, so the 1972 will most likely have a 4 speed syncromesh transmission.

I like the 1972.  It is a big 8&quot; emblem in front, and the bigger engine.
These engines seem to last longer (I read of one going almost 200,000 miles
without being rebuilt), and I am sure that the extra power is nice to have.
It has the nice brakes.  It gets lots of stares and comments, mostly
friendly.  Definitely an old vintage vehicle, but with nice amenities.

I would say that if the rust is minimal, this would be a good buy.  Check
underneath at the cross members.  There are two major ones where the jack
points are located.  Look for rust there.  Also the battery tray will also
most likely be rusted out as well.  Pull the rubber floor mats up and look
at the floor for rust.  There should be a pan underneath that covers all of
the pedal mechanisms up front.  This is often missing.  Make sure that you
have the original jack.  They go for more than $100 on e-bay.  The owners
manual is worth about $25, make sure that you get that too if you can.

Good luck.

&gt;
&gt; I have the opportunity to buy a 1972 bus.  It's not a camper, in fact,
it's
&gt; pretty bare bones.  But it runs and seems to have a solid body.
&gt;
&gt; Trouble I'm having is that I know nothing about type 2's, having only
owned
&gt; a 1974 Super Beetle a few years while in college.
&gt;
&gt; Any comments would be appreciated.
&gt;
&gt; Thanks.
&gt;
