Subject: FS Drive Away Tent (#3)

Sorry for bugging you all like this.

Perhaps my phone (703 440 0448) does not work,,  I've gotten a lot of calls 
from 'out of area' and nobody was there..

Today is the last day I will post.  I will keep my cell phone on

cell is 703 861 9506

Price - $225 - Thursday
        $200 - Friday
        $175 - today, Saturday

I set it up on the deck, and it is remarkable!!  Only two small holes in the 
front door mosquito net, bigger one is about 1&quot; by 1&quot;, other is 1/8 x 1/8&quot;  
(one or two threads torn...)

No rips.  All Zippers like new.  All the stitching is WHITE!!

Very, very little dirt.


I have to get on my '94, and get out to the park.

Next time you see this advertised, it will be on E-Bay!!

I put a few pictures up at:
