Subject: 050 distibutor, electronic ignition, and timing

Hey all,

I have a '74, 1800 cc engine with a Weber progressive, no vacuum carb. 
 I just put in a 050 distributor and electronic ignition.

I set my timing at 4 degrees BTDC at idle and 28 degrees BTDC at high rpms.

The Bentley does not cover the timing on this because of the non stock 
parts involved.  The Library and Archive have little to say about 
timing.  The Bentley does say that the engine w/ stock dist. and duel 
carbs should be set at 10 ATDC.

I have received a couple of emails suggesting a greater advance of 38 
degrees or 40 degrees BTDC.  

My Question:  suggestions/recommendations of best timing settings from 
those who are experienced or have a set up similar to mine.

Thanks,

Bradley
