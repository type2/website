hi, i'm having some problems....maybe one of you can be of help.
here's the story thus far..
the starter on my '78 is toast, so i buy a used one &amp; throw it in. bus starts &amp; 
runs fine all day.  the next morning i go to start it &amp; the starter turns, but 
won't turn the engine over, so i pull it, put it back in &amp; it starts up fine.  
for the past week or so it's been doing this off &amp; on. sometimes if it won't 
start i put the car in gear and push it a bit, then sometimes it starts.  i have

no clue why it's doing this...the flywheel &amp; pinion gear are in good shape &amp; the

starter sounds good. when i read the procedure in the manual, it said there is a

 bushing that goes on the end of the shaft. i did not get one with my starter, 
as it was used &amp; didn't recall seeing anything fall out of the hole when i 
pulled the old one.  any help is appreciated.
