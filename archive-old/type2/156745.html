&gt; &gt; They're about $3, but Radio Shack is overpriced imo.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; And virtually impossible to get out of without buyin' a cell phone...
&gt; If you do buy somethin' there and they ask for your name, address,
&gt; or phone number only give it if the salesman/woman gives you theirs... ;-(

That varies from store to store.  Mine doesn't ask for any of that stuff.

Be careful about your phone number, though.  Lots of stores are asking for
them now, because if you have a &quot;business relationship&quot; with a company
they can legally make junk phone calls to you even if you are on the do
not call list.
