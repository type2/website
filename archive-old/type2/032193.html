Subject: RE: 1971 owners manual

i was checking out ebay today and they have an owners manual for a 71 bus,
a 78 bus and a bunch of other owners manuals for different years.  go to
www.ebay_dot_com and try searching under &quot;vw&quot; or &quot;volkswagen&quot;  beware, though,
stuff sometimes sells for insane amounts of money.  i tried to buy an
owners manual for my 1969 westy a couple of weeks ago and it sold for
$26.13 plus shipping.  kinda pricey.  im willing to pay $20 but not that
much.  ive also been looking for the camper supplement, but one of those
hasnt shown up yet.

until then, i have an owners manual out of my &quot;stored&quot; 1968 bus.  

if you want something close, go to http://thesamba_dot_com/vw/type2 and look
under the literature column.  if you scroll down, there is a 1970 owners
manual and a 1970 camper supplement loaded up on the web.  pretty much
complete.
