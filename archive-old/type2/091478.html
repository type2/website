Subject: Re: [T2] new engine ...no power

Sure do. You used a vw engine instead of a Porsche engine. VW never
made an engine that produced much power :)

Seriously. give us an idea of what you mean by no power as well as
where you are with tune-up &amp; maintenance issues. That will help w/ the
diagnosis.
