Subject: Odd electrical issues

Hi All,

so, I'm having some odd electrical issues and can't get started.

The battery appears to be good, a multimeter shows 12.4V when everything
is off.

The spark plugs are warn but don't like bad. I'm about to walk over to
the local FLAPS to get a new set just in case.

This isn't the first time this has happened, and it always seems to
happen when it's either cold or extremely wet outside. There will be
quite a bit of acid build-up around the terminals (blue-ish powder).

I clean, take the leads off and scratch the terminals but to no effect.

If I throw on a battery charger and let it sit for a hour or so, then I
am able to start up just fine.

Is it just time to get a new battery? And how come if the voltage shows
to be within normal operating parameters? And what's up with the acid
build-up?

Thanks,
Harry
