I'll chime in here.  I don't know if the mounts on a 78 are the same as
the mounts for my 71 (confirmation anyone?), but if so, they are not a big
deal at all to replace.  And they are quite important in saving the life
of your tranny and your crankshaft (I imagine).

There are two rubber mounts on either side of the engine compartment,
behind the crossbar.  The engine literally rests in them.  They should
have one side that has a threaded bolt coming out (pointing up, I believe)
and a threaded hole on the bottom side, allowing you two points to lock
down each mount.  As David said, just support the engine, once you've
taken off the mounting hardware (one nut and one bolt on each side), jack
up the engine just enough to barely clear the mounts, slide them out, and
put the new ones in.  

Mine were no more than $15 apiece.

The Bus Depot has them for $6.95 each. 

Your local is probably not much more.

Let me know if you need more details on the install/removal.  I thought
Bentley had some info on this?
