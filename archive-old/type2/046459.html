Subject: Re: [T2] heater for bus?

we have that very same heater in our sailboat (Island Packet 40).  i
wouldn't recommend it for the interior of your vehicle.  it's pretty large
(approximately 2ft high w/o plumbing, and it must be mounted vertically), it
has no blower, an open flame, and gets incredibly hot.  so much so that when
mounted to a bulkhead, it has to have a heat shield and insulation installed
on the wall next to it.  the flue (a unique design called a Charlie Noble)
is about half the size of one on the Westfalia's left side.  a unique design
called a Charlie Noble.
