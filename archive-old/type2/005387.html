Coleman sells a special hose and valve assembly to use a bulk propane tank
with one of their stoves originally setup to use the disposable bottles.
We've used one of these for over 20 years with absolutely no problems of any
kind.

The hose coupling threads onto the Coleman stove's fitting right where the
brass plumbing exits the metal stove case.  No other adapters or fiddling
necessary - the connection doesn't even need a tool.

Where the hose attaches to the bulk tank there is a combination valve and
pressure regulator.  Both the tank valve and the Coleman hose's valve must
be open for fuel to flow.

Our hose is ~8' long, but I believe other lengths are available.  The
complete hose/regulator/valve assembly stores inside our 2-burner Coleman
stove, along with our piezoelectric stove lighter, and the whole works rides
under the seat/bed with the tools and spare parts.

&gt;&gt;  My Coleman portable stove is designed to run on high pressure propane.
There is some kind of a pressure reducing valve at the point where the
bottle screws on, but it doesnt reduce it to the same low pressure that the
stock stove wants.  &lt;&lt;
