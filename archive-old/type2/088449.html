Subject: The Rock report

Hello all,
 I just returned from the Rockingham NC show. I had a blast. We camped the
night before with 2 71 busses and a vanagon, from Jacksonville NC, under
some trees at the track. Stayed up late , had a good time and then crashed
in the camper(75 westy) in our first camp out since we bought it and we also
used out westy tent for the first time. I slept great although I only got a
total of 4.5 hrs of sleep.
There went a lot of busses at the show, 2 71s, a slammed 70 deluxe, my 75,my
65 singlecab a 66 ez camper, 67 standard and 66 dormmobile, I saw a few late
campers in the parking lot.  Hopefully I will have some pics up soon
I am sunburned and tired so its time to sign off,
 Later-
Bryan
