Subject: Re: Compression Test

i have a compression tester with a rubber hose that screws into the cylinder.
  it is removable from the guage easily, so it can be installed with out the
gauge in the way.  forget the brand.  ive used it on pancake buses with no
problem.  the hose is maybe a foot long.
