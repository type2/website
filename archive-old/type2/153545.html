Subject: Re: [T2] center seat clamps

Perer asked:


 Does anyone know if there's a difference in the seat clamps pre-72 and
post-72?  CIP has the seat clamps, but they say they're for 72 and earlier:

 http://www2.cip1_dot_com/ProductDetails.asp?ProductCode=VWC%2D211%2D898%2D825%2D4

 They look like what was in my 77.

 ----------------------------------------------------------------------

I believe it to be a mis-print. Should say 52-67. Starting in 68, the clamps have a locating pin on them to
match the hole in the seat base. Split bus seats do not have the hole. [although some people say the hole
started in 67, I have not seen 67 middle seats with the hole]

The wing nut was 66 and back, but it does work on bays. The 67 and bays use a hex nut.

Here is a pic of the 68 owners manual:
http://www.thesamba_dot_com/vw/archives/manuals/68bus/page8.jpg
It clearly shows the locating hole in the middle seat frame where the rear clamp is removed and the hex nuts.

Page 14 of the 67 owners manual also says to 'remove the hex screws [nuts] with the socket wrench in the tool
kit':

Wolfsburg West also sells them, they say they make them but I don't believe them!, and they say they fit buses
up to 1979. Yes, they will, but only 68 to 79. Not split window buses.

The clamp above is the taller middle seat clamp. It is 46mm tall.
The rear seat clamp is shorter and part number 221 885 285A. It is 27mm tall.

They are a little mis-leading on the T bolts because they are the long ones.
http://www.wolfsburgwest_dot_com/cart/DetailsList.cfm?ID=N161372
There were 2 different lengths originally: short for the rear seat and long for the middle seat.
The rear seat T bolt is part number N161341 and is 10 x 35mm
The middle seat T bolt is part number N161372 and is 10 x 50mm
