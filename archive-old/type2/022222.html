Rob asked:
&gt;The other day at the VW show someone must of tried to take the cap of my 
&gt;water filler for the sink and must of tightened it too much as they broke 
&gt;the tube that goes down into the cabinet. Any hints on what to do to fix. 

I got a new one a few years ago for $12.34 (yes, that's correct) from:
