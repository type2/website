Someone asked:
&gt;
&gt;How are busses as off road vehicles?

I recall an article/test report on the Bus, perhaps in Road &amp; Track (?) 
that called the breadloaf-era VW bus the second-best _two_ wheel drive 
vehicle that they had ever tested off-road, bettered only by the VW Thing.
I believe the report went on to say that it became squirrely on a very 
steep hill, but did very well on rough terrain and did not get stuck.
