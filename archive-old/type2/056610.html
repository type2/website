Subject: Re: Front Door Window Screens - how to:

I followed these instructions and the screens worked really well, the
only thing I'd do differently is to use TWO magnetic strips _at_ the top...
the screens would blow off on the Baja trip, but only on twisting
perilous mountain roads, tempting me to reach across and try and tack
them up (on the passenger side) while I steered with one hand...
very exciting! Definitely use TWO magnetic strips at the top!!
