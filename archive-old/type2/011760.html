Subject: DP vacuum port

I've a question about the end castings on the DP intake manifolds.
I have two sets of these and just realized the one set has a vacuum port
and the other doesn't.  I installed the set that doesn't have the port
on the rebuild.  Did I make [another :( ] error?  I'll be using a
34pict 3 carb on a stock 1600 dp engine.
