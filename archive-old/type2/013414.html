Snoopy, did you get any responses from your question or did you figure
it out yet?  I have a 73 Bus that I have had the exact same thing
happen to me on two or three different occasions.  I think I have 
narrrowed down the fix.  At first I checked the connections under the
dash and also spun my fuses.  I didn't take the fuse out I just pushed
on it so it spins in it's place.  That fixed the problem.  When I had
the problem the last time I spun the fuses and found one of the fuses
on the right handside, maybe the second or third one in gave me back
the turn signals, fuel guage and the gen light went out.   I replaced
the fuse and the problem hasn't come back.  The fuse wasn't blown but
there must have been something wrong with it.  Hope this helps if you
still have the problem.

Kevin

&gt; Help,
&gt; My gen light just came on. It is only on with the bus running.  Turn
signals
&gt; and gas gauge don't work.  Don't know what else yet.  Checked all
the wires
&gt; near the voltage regulator and the coil.  Any ideas???
&gt; 
&gt; This is on a 73 carbed 1800 with compufire ign.
