&gt; All this talk of waving reminds me of the two fingered wave we do here in

&gt; you are most likely crazy or from the west coast, don't ya know ;-).  No, we've
&gt; got the two finger.  Keep both hands on the wheel, where they belong, and use
&gt; your left hand, the index and middle finger. You sweep those two fingers in a
&gt; nice gentle arc without removing your palm from the wheel. It is a thing of
&gt; beauty when properly done.

Here on the west coast, most folks prefer to give VWs the one finger 
wave. Yep... they are #1 in my book, too.
