&gt;Hiya all,
&gt;     Anyone know of a VW FLAPS in Portland? I need some VW specific parts,
&gt;also a VW friendly junkyard would be good. TIA...
&gt;Peace,
&gt;Eddie

Try these places:

Halsey Import Parts
7721 NE Halsey
Portland, OR
800-792-0081
503-256-0182
Comment: Good, helpful, parts department associated with a VW repair shop in
the same building. I've had good experiences there so far.

The Parts Barn
11700 SE Stark St.
Portland, OR
800-500-8001
503-255-8001
Comment: Helpful on the telephone, they were recommended by the folks at
Halsey as an alternate parts source, since they deal with different
wholesalers and/or distributors.

John's Import Auto Parts
4701 SE 24th Ave.
Portland, OR
503-231-1601
Comment: Regarded by mechanics I know as the best import parts house in
Portland metro area. Sharp, informative and helpful sales staff.

German Auto Salvage
30495 SE Hwy 212
Boring, OR  (NO, IT'S NOT A JOKE . . .but, then again . . .)
800-650-8814
503-663-3006
Comment: Although I have heard shops recommend this place to
do-it-yourselfers, I have no experience with them myself.

Hope this helps! Regards,
