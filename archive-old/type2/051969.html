My 1978 Panama/Agata, &quot;Chux Bus II&quot;, &quot;Chocolate Bus II&quot;, is a C exterior/B 
interior in transition to A.

I'm torn between keeping the color authentic original and using other 
authentic VW colors.  I'd like to use the navy blue like the '69 Beetle my 
parents had, with a cloud white or savannah beige roof.  Or maybe that dark 
green.

I'd be interested to see pics of others' busses that were painted non-stock 
with VW colors.  Or any '68-'71 other than red/white.

...If I only had a garage...
