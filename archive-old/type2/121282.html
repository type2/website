&gt; With that in mind I might reconsider getting a cover for the bus. The car
&gt; cover for my small car doesn't have grommet holes to tie to so I do have
&gt; problems in the wind without two people.

       I am new to the list &amp; Type 2 ownership as 9/10/03 I bought  a '70 bus 
[Sportsmobile/penthouse] with the plan of taking the winter monthhs to rehab 
it as our vacation home.  I bought a car cover tent [$100.00 _at_ BJs] which 
stands on its own can be driven into &amp; out of.
       While most of the posts are more technical than my abilities,  
Immediately had all engine seals &amp; hoses replaced &amp; new brakes installed.  I am 
enjoying learning all the things that can [&amp; most likely will] go wrong.  I hope to 
stay current &amp; knowledgeable. One of the first things I will do is install 
retractible seat belts.
