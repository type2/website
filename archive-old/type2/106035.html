Subject: Re: [T2] Anti Theft Deterrent System ATDS

The theft deterrant I have in mind would be a simple circuit to blast the 
horn (or another horn, for simplicity) and maybe flash some lights /at any 
time the ignition is on./ I would have a hidden cut-off switch somewhere 
under the dash perhaps, which I would know about, but no stranger possibly 
could... in fact, you might hook it into the door-open circuit for the dome 
light, so that if a door was even opened it would begin blaring, unless you 
had a remote to shut it off first. It's an easy system to make embarassing 
mistakes with, but it'll put off all but the most professional and/or most 
stupid car theives/looters.
