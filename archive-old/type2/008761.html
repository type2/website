&gt; It is friday, or at least friday late.
&gt; I am having to answer this question about oil again, I have posted
this 
&gt; before I think.
&gt; I use recycled oil only. Yep thats right my busses get recycled oil.
I 
&gt; dont care what brand as long as it is recycled. Is this a good idea? 
&gt; Yep. I am completing the loop of returning oil, having it cleaned,
and 
&gt; returning it to my bus. Why? It isn't expensive, additives are put
back 
&gt; into the oil the same as any other oil, (look for starburst symbol
and 
&gt; API rating), and it works just as well as anything else. My bus runs 
&gt; cool as always, and with frequent oil changes, the best thing you
can do 
&gt; for your bus, its ecenomical. 

All true.  Rerefined oil has been around since way before &quot;recycling&quot;
became a popular topic.  Basically, if the oil's rating is high enough
and you trust the rerefiner not to fudge on the rating, you have a
winner!

&gt; I have amazing longevity on all my engines, and I challenge you all
to 
&gt; think about doing the same. Where exactly is all that oil you are 
&gt; returning going?

&gt;From what I understand, the majority of oil returned for recycling is
sold as bunker fuel for ships.  Yep, they burn it!
