Subject: [T2] On the road again

Hey y'all
Once again the Burrito Express will be making an epic voyage.  I'm heading 
to Miami from Charleston, leaving Sunday.  Departing Miami Friday afternoon 
to visit with Mom in St Pete until Sunday then back to Charleston.  Intend 
the superslab snore for time sake.  (95/826 to Miami, 41/75/275 to St Pete, 
4/95 back to Chuckytown unless Charlie Ford REALLY needs to unload Peekaboo 
the bird then a detour up 301 to Jessup Ga will happen.

Any listees on the route keep an eye out for us (big ugly guy in off white 
Dormobile with funky exhaust), wave (use all your fingers please), maybe we 
could hook up for a cup o'coffee along the route.  I'll bring the AIRS list 
with me justin case.

Dave
