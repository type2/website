Be careful about sitting on an electric blanket unless it is specifically
designed to be sat or laid on.  Warming up your posterior tends to numb it
as well, so you can easily get burned without knowing it if the blanket
gets too hot.  Not likely, but it takes only once to make your life
miserable!
