Subject: Re: [T2] weber carb 

The price new for this carb is $300 at Bus Depot.


 I have one (DFEV) with about 4000 miles on it that I am replacing with dual
carbs. I think I still have my receipt. It is the one with electric choke.
Its still nice and clean and has BRAND NEW intakes that goes with it and the
SCAT breather. Nice and clean and definately doesn't need to be rebuilt,
practically new.  I would sell it for $150 if anybody wants it and $8 for
shipping (US) to help with the cost of my dual carbs I am buying.

Email me privately for pics, etc.,

&gt; The weber progressive kit is exactly what you need. The kit comes complete
&gt; with intake manifolds, air cleaner, carb, etc.  Yes, it can be used with a
&gt; universal electric pump (and in fact wouldn't work with the VW
&gt; fuel-injection fuel pump anyway).  You will need a pump with 2-4 psi
output.
&gt; We sell a Facet pump that works well with it.  My part numbers are 43 067
00
&gt; for the carb kit and 412010 for the pump.
