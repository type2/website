Check and replace distributor cap and plug wires if need be.  Moisture will
cause the spark to follow cracks around inside the dist. and out cracks in
the plug wires or cracked boots.


&gt;Happy Wednesday Y'all!
&gt;My 1975 Riviera camper runs GREAT!  Except when it is damp and moderately
&gt;cold outside as it was this morning (40 degrees and foggy in Cincinnati).
&gt;Under these conditions, It will not
&gt;hold an idle.  Runs fine as long as my foot stays on the accelerator, but
&gt;as soon as I stop giving gas, it stalls.  It starts right up again after
&gt;this.  Also, when I engine brake by down-shifting, it sputters, spits and
&gt;backfires, sounds like someone put a popcorn popper in my engine
&gt;compartment (every time it backfires, my 2 year old son exclaims WOOHOO!!
&gt;Which is pretty cute, but I would rather my bus run smoothly).  It seems
&gt;to do these things in temperatures between 30 and 40 degrees.  Any warmer
&gt;or colder than this and it doesn't seem to be a problem.  Any body have a
&gt;clue for me???  I'm guessing that I'm getting moisture somewhere, but
&gt;where??
