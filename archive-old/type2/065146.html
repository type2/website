Subject: Re: The Simpsons and VW's

&gt;&gt; Speaking of TV shows containing VW's a few episodes of the Simpson's (my
&gt;&gt; favorite show) show VW's (or artists renderings of VWs) usually in very
&gt;&gt; stereotypical situations.  The episode that always sticks out in my mind
&gt;&gt; is the one where Homer's meets his long lost mother.  At the end she
&gt;&gt; leaves on a electric powered bus.  I also believe that in the episode were
&gt;&gt; Bart and Lisa go to Camp Krusty they show a Bug.  School ends for the 
summer,
&gt;&gt; all the gets run out excited and a group of them rock/tip over a Bug.

To add more fuel to the VW/Simpson's fire (so to speak), Marge's sisters 
drive a Thing. I've seen it on two separate episodes.

Do you think that Matt Groenig is a VW person? Hmmmm.
