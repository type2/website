Subject: window drops, exhaust not stock

I just bought an '82 GL that I'm trying to get ready for the winter. 
 

1. My passenger window keeps dropping off the track when the door is slammed. There is a white 
nylon rectangular piece that fits over a stud on the rail that guides the window up. The window 
pops off this nylon thing.

My questions are:  

Is there a retainer or clip that supposed to be on the back side to keep it from popping off? 

Is the strip of wood I found in the door part of this mystery?

2. I have a non stock exhaust hanging off the heater boxes. It has a serpentine pipe array that 
connects to a &quot;Bugpack&quot; muffler. I think I've seen these on dune buggies and bugs!

My questions are: 

Is this muffler and pipe assembly significantly louder than a stock one? 

Is there a benefit to keeping it as opposed to changing it to a stock one? 

What would it cost to change it if I did?
