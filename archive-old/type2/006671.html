Subject: Re: [T2] torquing heads

We increase torque on all the 10mm stud engies we build, but the 8mm engines
stay at 18, and no more than 20 Ft/lbs....

I have a TURBO engine running 13 PSI boost and stock 10mm studs, with our
case saved inserts..The studs ONLY were cryoed and Every time I have torque
checked the heads, they have been where they belong..Not one sign of
leakage..

If heads get torqued too much when the engine expands the results can be
bad, as the torque is almost doubled with expansion. VW designed the studs
to expamd at near the same rate as the cylinder to keep torques
consistant...

&gt; I believe Berg mentioned increasing the torque on heads a few psi from
&gt; factory - I'd have to dig out my tech notes to see fer shure; I do know
&gt; at least 2 rebuilders in my town do so as well, and are fairly anal
&gt; about getting the torque RIGHT (lubing threads with light coating of
&gt; motor oil, running a nut up and down each bolt to clean the threads,
&gt; allowing them to cool from that before tightening a NEW nut, etcetcetc.).
