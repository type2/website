Would like to know what all has to be removed from the engine (2 L) in a 78 Westy to remove the baffles.  Our new addition has been sitting up for a while and there is quite a bit of gunk in there........ she is running, but we don't want to burn her up...... 
Thanks......... Gail


78 Westy (green) as yet- unnamed
