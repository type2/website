Subject: Throttle switch, or lack thereof

To all, It is quite possible that I've lost my mind&lt;and I've an ex-wife who'd 
happily agree&gt; but I can not seem to locate the throttle switch on my stock 
1978 2.0L FI eng. Went so far as to remove the throttle body and AFC meter. 
Still can find no sign of a micro switch, attachment points or electrical 
leads for the same. Nor can I find any type of &quot;cam&quot; on the throttle body 
linkage, as shown in my Haynes manual. Did the ' 78 model not have this 
switch?&lt; if so, why doesn't my bloody Haynes manual tell me this?&gt; The eng. 
starts, idles and runs superbly...yet I'm now becoming paranoid about my 
mixture being incorrect due to lack of input to the ECU.
