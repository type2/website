Subject: [T2] buying a used crank

&gt;i gave it a good wack and heard it ring true. is there anything else i
&gt;should look for in terms of  buying a used crank?

Measurements would be nice.( Bentley ).
Straight would be, too. ( V-blocks, dial indicator ).
And check for blue heat marks.
Or take it to a machinist.
They will often check it for free. Bring the VW specs.
