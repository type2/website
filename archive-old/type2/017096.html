Subject: Re: Consensus Opinions? (sway bars, oil coolers)

My sense of the consensus on SWAY BARS is that there's a tradeoff
between stability and the independence of your suspension.  Where are
you going to be driving, the windswept highway, or offroad?  Also, get
good C or D load rated tires (see archive!) before you even think about
sway bars.

Oil coolers seem to be deemed desirable mostly for the non type 4
powered busses, especially if in a hot climate.  This is best done when
you are ordering or building a new engine.  Also, I'd say the wisdom of
the list is to go for a good setup, the right hoses, thermostat, and
good matrix style cooler.  The Hoover sermons are worth looking at on
this, not to mention the archive again.  See the Ness-tek section of the
type2 site to have a look at the Audi bracket that lets you use the
stock oil cooler externally.
