I'm relatively new to the list, and have an observation we could all gain
from.  I am not criticizing anyone nor pretending to know it all:
    Several questions start out like: ...and did a compression check on my
30,000 mile engine and one was really low, or ...and I dont know why it runs
so hot.  Now I have also noticed that a high percentage follow up these
comments by adding:  It never had any problems til now...cruises all day
long at 80 miles per hour...
    Well, I am not concluding a cause-effect here, but what a correlation!
Anyone else notice this? I know some hop-ups would make 80 mph all day long
possible. But I dont get it.  Who else likes those bumper stickers that say
&quot;my other vw is even slower&quot;?

Slow em down...OWN that right lane! Your bus will smile!
