Subject: Hello to all/ A question about speed ranges

Hello to all. My name is Jim Carter and I have finally joined the list after 
lurking on the type2 site for a few months. I have a question regarding the 
actual vs. anticipated speed in gears for my 1979 Westfalia. First some 
background for you. I've got a 2.0L stock engine with 105,000 miles actual on 
the odo. Running stock FI, Pertronix Ignitor and plat. plugs. Compression is 
between 145-150 on all cylinders and leakdown shows less than 10% per hole. 
Trans/clutch is new. The entire vehicle is in near perfect condition, with 
the original owner bordering on fanatical/anal-retentive when it came to its 
upkeep. As this is my first type 2 , I'm curious as to what kind of power I 
should expect. It seems enemic to me, but several friends have told me that 
it would seem to be in line with their collective experiences, as they all 
own, or have owned, busess of similar vintage. I know I'm not dealing with a 
lot of hp, but is it normal not to be able to stay in 4th gear to climb 
moderate hills and still maintain 60-65mph? And what should my speed in the 
various gears be in mph/rpm?
Sorry for the stupid questions, but I looked far and wide for a Westfalia in 
this condition, and paid dearly for it, so I don't want to over-run or 
overload it.
