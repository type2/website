&gt; The genuine VW/Brazil ones fit correctly and definitely do not leak when
&gt; properly installed on a bus with no windshield channel rust. We've sold
&gt; thousands of them. They are the same seals used on brand new Mexican VW
&gt; bus production, so you can be assured they do fit perfectly.



Ron, didn't mean to cause any offense towards your products. I've bought
alot of parts from your company without a problem and will continue to do
so. You have the largest selection for the best price 99% of the time. The
seal looks great and seems to be of high quality but just didnt quite keep
the water out the first time.

&gt; Very likely the seal was just not quite seated properly
&gt; somewhere along the windshield channel - just a hair off. When the
&gt; garage removed and reinstalled the windshield again, they probably got
&gt; it seated better, so the leak went away. Since you were having a
&gt; problem, they were probably much more careful and in tune with any tiny
&gt; abnormality when they installed it the second time.

  This is very possible. They said that there was zero rust in the channel
so that shouldn't have been a problem. This is a strictly aircooled shop
that does service and resto work and is one of the bigger shops locally so I
assumed they knew what they where doing.


&gt; For what it's worth, many of the bus seals sold as German VW are
&gt; actually sourced from VW/Brazil and simply repackaged in Germany anyway.
&gt; I have seen more than one case where identical seals were in the same
&gt; shipment, some in VW/Germany boxes and some in VW/Brazil boxes. Rear
&gt; hatch seals are one example. So I am reluctant to refer to seals as
&gt; German VW unless I'm sure, since in many cases they are just repackaged
&gt; VW/Brazil seals despite the labeling. But you pay more because you're
&gt; paying to have your seal shipped from Brazil to Germany to the U.S.,
&gt; with everyone marking it up along the way. I can't say for sure that
&gt; this is the case with windshield seals but it certainly would not shock
&gt; me.  So while we can get &quot;German&quot; seals, I can't justify the extra price
&gt; given that the VW/Brazil ones have the correct OEM fit and cost a third
&gt; the price.  (The same cannot be said about many of the aftermarket
&gt; Brazilian/Mexican seals out there, however.)


  Thats interesting to know. I assumed if it said &quot;German VW&quot;  that it was
manufactured in Germany. Not just shipped from Germany.

Thanks for the info Ron!
