&lt;&lt; wow ian very very cool bus ... i love the wood work in that bus and the 
homemade roof rack ...
gives me some grewat ideas as well .. havent ever seen that bus online till 
now really neat thanks for shareing ian..
peace bro.. &gt;&gt;

I put &quot;kick panels&quot; on the bottom of my doors...Made templates from the
door panels and cut them out of some scrap 1/4 inch oak faced plywood.
Rather than drill more holes in the door frames, I used plastic wall anchors
in the existing holes in the doors and screwed stainless steel roundhead
screws with ss finishing washers into the anchors...
