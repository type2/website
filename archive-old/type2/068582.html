&gt; 57 beetle
&gt;-- End of excerpt from pickle
 &gt;Keep it original and get another car to &quot;modify&quot;.

It's your car. You paid the money for it. Do what you want !!! don't let
people browbeat you into doing something you don't want to.
When I first got my notch I got about 10 nasty letters from people who said
that the only good notch is a &quot; correct and fully restored&quot; one.
Screw that !! I bought it and if I want to chop the top 4 inches, put chebby
rims on it and put a 2 liter in it, it's MY perogitive.
If someone wants to donate a car to you and then tell you how to restore it
then that's fine. But if you bought it, you do YOUR way.

later, Dan
