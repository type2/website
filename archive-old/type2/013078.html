Folks, things have changed and I am selling my 1982
Westfalia Vanagon. This van is very clean and has the
full camper package with stove, fridge and sink.  I
have both tables and all screens and the canvas on the
pop top is in good shape.  Exterior paint is original
light blue and the interior is beige.  Has new cv
joints and partial rebuild of the engine. I am located
in Austin Texas, so if interested drop me an email or
call me at (512) 795-9496.  Thanks!
