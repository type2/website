Subject: Battery good, radio plays, lights come on, motor won't turn
  over

Volks,

The 69 Westy we put a new motor in has ALWAYS turned over and fired up 
at the first click of the key.

Tonight, while running out for Chinese it would not.

Radio works. Lights work. Interior electrics work. Battery is good.

When I turn the key to turn the motor over, the generator light dims 
slightly, and that is all. No sounds of a starter turing over or 
anything.

Thoughts? I perused the archives, but didn't find what I needed.

Starter issue???

Thanks,
Anton
