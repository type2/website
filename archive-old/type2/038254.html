Subject: Smoke in the cabin 72 T2

Well, I took my 72 Adventurewagen on its maiden voyage yesterday to work. 
Its a little over 7 miles each way in town and nothing major happened. On 
its short little trips before this, I had noticed some smoke getting into 
the van itself, but I just figured it was coming around from the outside 
since I thought one of the pushrod tube seals were leaking. About half way 
to work, somthing fell in the back and when I turned around to look see if 
everything was ok, I notice a fairly large amount of blue smoke comeing from 
under the rear seat. I think there are two(or more) little vents for heat(?) 
and thats where it looked like it was coming from, but maybe not. When I got 
to work, I let the bus set for over an hour. Then I looked under it to see 
how much oil was being lost. To my surprise, only a couple drops had hit the 
ground. I really expected to see a large puddle, but maybe its being burnt 
off instead of dropping down.

I was going to go outside today and have a look under the bus, but its a 
rainy nasty day. So does anyone have an idea where all the smoke is coming 
from or how its getting under the rear seat? For the most part, the bus is 
original, so the heat tubes still may be hooked up. If so, I was going to 
unhook those and see if it helps, but not with it raining.

Any thoughts ?

Thanks,
David
