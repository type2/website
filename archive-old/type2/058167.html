Subject: RE: 79 engine and trans into 72

&gt; I put an  091 in my '73 with the '73 bellhousing (1/2 inch total longer)
&gt; and was able to get by without modifying the shift rod - the gearshift was
&gt; just slightly farther back than it was before in each gear.
&gt; 
	I did exactly the same thing, put the 091 in a 75 Bus and just used
the original Bellhousing.  To be honest I didn't even notice the gearshift
being slightly farther back although I have quick shift kit which shortens
the throw anyway so this may disguise it.  The Bus was off the road for a
long time while it got a new engine and transaxle so I may have just
forgotten where the stick normally sits :)

	The only other problem I had was fitting the starter motor, if you
have a larger than standard starter it may not clear the extra ribbing on
the case of the 091, I'm running a starter from a 2.1 water cooled bus and
this is quite a bit bigger so I needed to grind some of the ribs down
slightly.
