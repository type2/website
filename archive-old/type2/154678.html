Yeah,

No way would I sell that thing if it was hanging out in my garage! But I
would probably start modifying it to Bay standards and kill my mojo...

I should give you my &quot;supervisor's&quot; telephone number and you can give her an
earful about BBB. :\ grrrr

Here I have three Type 2's and none will see pavement. Ah well. I'll miss
you guys too. We'll have to do a local weekend campout when the snow starts
to melt around here.
