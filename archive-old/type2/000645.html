    Hi List:
 It's nice and warm here in Ontario Canada.............Got the BN4 gas
heater fired up and running Great!
Thanks go to Ken Fricke and Luc Perron for their suggestions.
Luc had the correct diagnosis , the fuse under the overheat switch was
missing!!!
I some how overlooked this as i thought it must be inside(under) the switch.
Tonight i found the fuse holder on the outer case empty!
Installed the fuse and tryed with sucsess.
I let the heater run for 10 min. then  turned the timer off. The fuel pump
shut down and the fan continued to run for 2-3 min for cool down.
Yet to do is check out the temp. regulator.

Thanks Again.
I'll be warm on the way to work in the AM.
