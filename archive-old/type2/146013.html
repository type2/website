Subject: Re: [T2] smaller bumper overriders

&gt; Which Bays (68-72) had/have the smaller bumper overriders as opposed to the 
&quot;full &gt; size&quot; (taller) ones?  And, just in front? or front and back same?
 
My understanding is that the smaller bumper over-riders for the 68-72's were 
a European option, where the taller ones were more common here in the U.S. 
There was a sweet '70 westy down the street from me and the owner said it was a 
European delivery model and it had the smaller ones in the back, and the taller 
ones in the front. That combo really looked nice IMHO.
