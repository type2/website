&gt; &gt; So yesterday I call them up and ask them for a price check for the five major
&gt; &gt; door seals  I nearly fell on my _at_ss - with tax, $600.00!!!! (That's in Canadian Funds).
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Can anyone suggest a less expensive source for these seals? -
&gt;
&gt; I just got an entire set of every piece of rubber needed for my double cab from
&gt; Bus Depot.  I priced out WCM and was expecting to pay almost $800 for all that
&gt; stuff.  Bus Depot came through for about $375 US (including shipping)

Ditto, I can't believe WCM reams people for the seals like they appear
to, the rubber on my '65 pile-of-bones was just a couple hundred
bucks... Bus Depot has excellent prices.
