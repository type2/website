Subject: Re: [T2] sub-cultures


&gt;I just took five people to lunch in my bus, three of which are well old
&gt;enough to remember when air-cooled VWs reigned supreme. Based on the sheer
&gt;awe, and silly (to me) questions - you would think they were riding in a
&gt;space ship. It was as if I had created this thing in the garage, and it was
&gt;the only one of it's kind. The biggest suprise to them all was that I had a
&gt;closet in my van.

One ex-girlfriend's little sister /did/ think my bus came from outer space.

I suppose they're just getting rarer and rarer. I did a u-turn in a 
elementary school lot once, and I swear both of the teams practicing peewee 
baseball stopped to stare at it. It's about the right color - must have 
looked like the funkiest school bus they'd ever seen.
