&gt;About the only thing that was a constant problem was the high current flow

&gt;build-up will melt stuff.  There are ways to re-engineer the system to use
&gt;relays to control everything and get
&gt;around this problem.

I am about to start work on this very thing.  Currently the two 12V fans on 
the condensor are wired in series (no typo) and draw about 4 amps through 
the switch (not counting the current from the evaporator fans).  One of the 
fans is having mechanical problems and the time has come to replace them 
with something that moves more air.  I was already a little worried about 
about the switch but your message confirms it - I will be installing a 
relay to power the new fans.  Bosch 25 amp relays in the little black cube 
are cheap and easy to come by - perfect for this application.

&gt;I'm currently working on the DPD unit in a type I, which is very similar to
&gt;the type II unit, and have been able to find everything except the
&gt;compressor drive belt.  It's a weird belt with a much sharper &quot;V&quot; angle.
&gt;Does anyone know of a source for these belts?

I was at True Value the other day and noticed that most of their lawnmower 
drive belts were thin like the A/C drive belt.  Not sure about the angle 
but it might be worth checking - they had them in all sizes for only a 
couple of bucks.  Failing that, I found that the local VW dealer here in 
Dallas could order the belts at a cost of $14 each.  Kinda steep.

I use a standard belt with the compressor mounted above the fan housing 
driven by the air injection pump pulley assembly.  This works fairly well 
once the rubber coupler problem is solved, but I have my concerns that the 
pulley assembly blocks some of the cooling air entering the fan and causes 
the engine to run hotter.  I'm starting to have thoughts of moving the 
compressor to the stock location and utilizing a pulley kit that is 
available for about $125 which uses standard automotive belts.
