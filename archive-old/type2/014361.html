Subject: Re: [T2] Exhaust Leak noise

Hello everyone,

I have a three part question about a 78 Westy (FI) I
am restoring.

First, I noticed the brown wire going into the voltage
regulator has had its insulation melted off, has
anyone had a similar problem and if so, what are the
likely causes?  

Second, the bus had sat for aprox 6 years when I dove
into the project.  I have replaced many standard items
such as fuel line, pump, plugs, points, ect.  I have
had it up and running, but there are two problems. 
First, after warming up for a good while (10 to 15
min) I get a rough idle eventualy into a stall.  I
just replaced the EGR valve (which had been frozen up)
and filter but now it wont run. Timing, ignition,
compression and fuel are present and within specs, I
am concerned that I may have the idle adjust screw way
out of wack, and am flooding it out.  Where is a good
starting place (i.e. turn screw all the way in and
back out two full turns?) I would also apreciate any
suggestions on the idle problem that may not be EGR
related.

Finaly, I know that hydrolic lifters don't need
adjusting, however, can anyone tell me how to adjust
them?

Thank you,
Chard
