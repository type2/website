I have 2 smaller fire extinguishers directly behind my seat.  Fast easy
access.  I don't want mine in the cabinetry (westy) or in the back hatch
- can't get to it easy if there is a fire.  Never really cook anything
that was high flame capacity ( no french fries in my bus ;-)  but I can
still get the extinguisher from behind the seat easy enough.
