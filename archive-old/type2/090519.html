Subject: looking to sell or trade my 72 for a pop-top

hello everyone. i am looking to either sell my bus or trade it for a
pop-top camper bus. with 2 crumbsnatchers and the SO its hard to sleep
4 in this bus.

i'm asking $1500, which is exactly what i paid for it. this bus was
originally a 72 Deluxe &amp; it has been converted to a camper on the inside.
also the PO is Chris 'ncbus' of Everybus fame, so you know it has been
well cared for.

the good:
-it has new tires &amp; shocks (yes, they are the correct tires for a bus,
Yoko Y356C)
-has a 76 westy interior installed (does not have sink cabinet - only z-bed, ice chest &amp; child's cot)
-very strong runner
-minimal rust
-well working stock heat (no, i'm not kidding)
-not a daily driver, 90% of the miles i have put on it are highway miles

the bad:
-it has the .009 w/ weber combination (does work well but of course not ideal)
-has a ding in the front right corner. (does not affect mechanicals, just
cosmetic)

pictures of the bus can be seen on my website. i can provide more detailed
pics if anyone is really interested.

what i am looking for as far as trades go:
- 74-78 Westy or Riviera (doesnt have to be perfect but i want one that
runs)

thanks,

Joel Wilson
