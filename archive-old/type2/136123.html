Subject: Power Steering?

      
Clifford Rhoton, '78 VW Bus / Camper Model 22.
    
Has anyone seen a successful power steering upgrade to
a Type-2 of any year prior to '79?  Power Steering was
not an option for these models.  And the Power
Steering fitted Vanagons have a re-designed front-end,
making a VW retro-fit to a '78 frame difficult.
    
I've researched the various types of power steering
available.  Other than the new steering column mounted
electrics (Insight, Prius), and the rack-and-pinion
power piston Macpherson types, the most common power
steering out there is a hydraulic-powered
steering-gear.  I have imagined using a '70's era GM
or Ford system, but would need to kludge connection to
the frame, not to mention the exotic drop-arm fitting.
     
Before launching into hazardous &amp; expensive territory
(not to mention the potential safety implications),
does anyone out there know of a successful Power
Steering conversion?
