Subject: RE: [T2] Looking for Baltic Birch in DC area

Jamie,

I just bought 3 sheets of 1/8&quot;x 5'x5' (equivalent metric size) baltic birch
from the Hardwood Store of NC.  they are between Greensboro and Burlington
NC near Elon College.  It is around $25 per sheet or about $60 for 3 sheets,
so I bought 3, I will probably have one extra.
http://www.hardwoodstore_dot_com/plywood.html

They didn't have a lot of the 5'x5' so it would be worth calling to make
sure they have it in stock.  also some that they had was &quot;airplane grade&quot;,
earmarked for some special order.

I don't know where else to get it, but for the headliner in a regular westy
it has to be bigger than the standard 48&quot; width in order to bend with the
grain.

I know it's not that close to DC but is IS close to the Everybus venue.

Atlanta, GA.
