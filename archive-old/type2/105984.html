Subject: Re: [T2] pulling a bus

&gt;Will one of those towing systems like RV'ers use to pull their vehicle
&gt;behind their RV work on a bus?  I've seen two types.  One that folds up and
&gt;sort of collapses against the bumper, and one that simply hinges so that the
&gt;tow bar is sticking up a bit above the edge of the hood.

Should if you can come up with a proper mounting system.

I saw an RV running down I-40 in middle Tn one day dragging a Westy for a 
support vehicle. Was far from being able to see the hitch.
