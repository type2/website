First, thanks much to all who have sent me pmails  over the course of the
past ~3 weeks regarding advice on purchasing, registering &amp; insuring
my school bus yellow '77 westy.  She's mine and all mine, legally
on the road, and running fine.

Now for some questions. I've searched the archives and couldn't find any 
info.

1.The swivel chair wouldn't move at all, and the fwd/back movement was really
effortful.  I removed the 4 bolts, wiggled the seat out, then removed the
round swivel plate that bolts to the bus. After cleaning &amp; lubing the thing
up, I can't get the seat back in.  Anybody with experience that can
enlighten me? It can't be this difficult. Maybe a second pair of hands?

The difficulty is getting the swivel release lever that is attached to 
the round swivel plate through the hole while it is set in place
of the base of the chair.  

I think during removal,the seat came free completely, leaving the round
swivel plate's release lever still threaded to the hole in the bus. I 
can't for the life of me figure out how.

any of this make sense?

2. I noticed in the archives someone mentioning their fuel gage works fine
for full to 1/2, then reads empty. Is that common? I think mine is
doing the same. Either that or it gets really poor mileage. On a 
related note, when I first filled it up, the automatic shutoff at the pump
didn't work gushing fuel out the filler. THEN I noticed gas flowing out
of the rear, left side of the bus! Was that really overfilled overflow
reservoirs backing up or somehting? A bit scary restarting the bus 
after that.  What kind of milage can I expect? '77 2.0 converted to 
single 2 barrel carb, freshly rebuilt, with minimal exhaust system.

3. which brings me to exhaust question. This has on each side simple
exhaust manifold attached to a pipe that does a 180 degree turn 
toward the back, glasspack mufflers &amp; tips, and that is it.
Is that what y'all refer to as j-tubes?  Other than heat, am I 
missing other benefits from the heaterboxes and other parts?

4. Shifting: since she is so loud, and this is my first aircooled VW,
I'm not sure when to shift. Muir gives guidelines but not sure if
they are current. I've been shifting 1st-2nd_at_~15-20, 2nd-3rd_at_~30-35,
and 3rd-4th_at_~45.  Tricky part is around-town limits are right at
the shift point leaving me either driving just before shiftpoints
(loud and harder on the motor) or shift earlier (potentially lugging
it), or driver a bit faster than the limit (~35 in a 30, 50 in a 45)
which doesn't please john law.

5. reasonable cruising speed: I've kept it at 60 on the highway
which is plenty fast for me, but would like to know what is
a reasonable limit, i.e. am I driving at the limit above which
is harmful, or is 65 just fine too.

6. Oil. How much is a reasonable leak? It still isn't down any oil
so I'm guessing it is minor, but should I investigate it? I keep
a flattened box under it when I park at home (I rent and other neighbors
won't care for a large black spot where ever I park), does anybody
have another solution to this problem?  Related question: I know,
bad topic, and I don't want to start a fart, but would like to 
state my intentions, and perhaps someone will care to pmail me if
they disagree- I will put strait 40 weight oil in it. St.Louis, MO
weather these days is damn hot (mid-90s and lows of 80s) so
figured it'd be better. 

Thanks much. PO is not around so can't ask him some of these questions.

Patrick
