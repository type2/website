Subject: Re: [T2] Ahnendorp Stainless Exhaust

&gt;Has anyone used the Ahnendorp stainless exhaust?  It looks great on their
&gt;website, but it's expensive.  Worth the money?
&gt;
&gt;&lt;http://www.ahnendorp_dot_com/index.html&gt;

Back in '95 I bought a bunch of stuff from them and was very satisfied. I 
bought the shorty dual carb manifolds for a Type IV, the carb linkage, the 
911 cooling kit (don't like the fiberglass but the aluminum parts I like), 
and a couple of other dinky things. Very nice toys if you can afford them 
(not me anymore, I was single back then...).

I did my transaction through the mail (no internet) and in English. Their 
replies were broken English. Very patient and helpful.

Shipped it to me UPS believe it or not. It made it to the ship's command in 
VA (I was in the Navy) and then they forwarded it to me on the ship. Got it 
at sea near Haiti but of course had no car to put them on... &lt;grin&gt;

Box was tattered, cargo was not.
