Subject: Re: [T2] Gas Tank Resurection

Hey Chris,

I had the same problem about a month ago with my 72.  Took out the firewall
(Fun, fun, fun) and low and behold rubber elbow was in pieces.

I looked eveywhere for the replacement part.  Found out that it was a one year
only piece and was no longer made.

Couple of people suggested air clean to carb connecting elbow (021128639).  I
bought it and decided that it would be safer with a piece of fuel line.

I just cut a piece long enough so it could make the turn without kinking.
Pushed it in on top of the tank and closed it up!  It seems to be ok.

Good luck.

&gt; Took the gas tank out of my 72 bus the other day and found out why the thing
&gt; always smelled like gas.  Turns out the rubber fitting that forms a right
&gt; angle and connects the gas tank to the vent pipe was hard, cracked, and
&gt; leaking.  There was a large stain on the tank where gas would slosh out of
&gt; the vent and drip down the back of the tank.
&gt;
&gt; I am in the process of replacing all the rubber hose conectors between the
&gt; long vent pipes that go up into the air intake vents.  But I havn't been
&gt; able to find anthing that will replace the rubber fitting that forms a right
&gt; angle.  The VW part # is 211 201 157.  I thought of maybe just using some
&gt; rubber fule line hose instead, but it is a sharp angle between the vent
&gt; ontop of the gas tank and the pipe that leads to the vent in the filler
&gt; neck.  It also has to have clearance once the firewall is reinstalled.
&gt;
&gt; Does anybody have any suggestions as to what to use in place of a stock
&gt; part?  Or is this part availale somewhere?  I checked Bus Depot.
&gt;
&gt; Also, the fuel filler neck is in ok condtion.  It is not cracked at all and
&gt; is still semi plyable.  I know I might catch flack for reusing it.  Would
&gt; something from Bus Depot work.  Like the one for a 73, or 74 and up?
&gt;
&gt; Thanks,
&gt;
