Hello Ethan, and others.

You say you're using a 30PICT-1 carb?  These were the last of the round bowl
carbs to the best of my knowledge.  I've the same carb and its a round bowl.
These carbs did not come stock with an idle cutoff switch.  Someone could have
put one in I suppose...in the air jet? outlet on the right side of the carb.
I've seen it done before.  It would be under the electric choke...on the
passengers side of the bus.  A little tube looking thing that screws into the
body of the carb and has a push on connector at the end.  I wouldn't think you'd
have one....but maybe?  Why did you choose the 30PICT-1 for a 1600 dual port?
just curious...

If this is not the case...yes..it could be timing I suppose.... are you SURE it
isn't timing?  Have you checked it?

I suppose the needle valve in your carb could be bad too....sticking perhaps.
Have you checked this out?

I've also heard that dieseling could be caused by carbon buildup on the
valves/heads...when this gets super hot, it is hot enough to ignite...and
therefore keep the engine running on after power is shut off.....such as a
diesel engine would...hence the name.  After a diesel engine is running...I
believe that one can take off all the electrical components...and it will still
run...less the fuel injection... they use it on diesels??  I'm not familiar at
all with em.  Either way...lesson being.._dot_compression and heat is used to ignite
diesel fuel....not a spark.

Until you get it figured out....what I always did was after you've parked...and
are ready to kill the engine... let it run for 20 seconds or so...just at idle.
If it still insists on dieseling... put the clutch in...stick it in gear...shut
the motor off (this step is VERY important... go figure why...) and after the
motor is off..kill it by letting the clutch out.  The engine is actually
spinning backwards while it diesels from what I hear...and have experienced.  I
did the clutch trick with mine once...and it was going rather fierce...and I put
the bus in 1st...and let the clutch out...and the bus jerked backwards.

I've also noticed that my engine will only diesel when its rather hot.

hope this helps?
