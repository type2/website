My father in Law ws a glass guy for years.  He taught me how to get windows
out w/o seal cutting.  Splay a LIBERAL abount of WD 40 around the seal area.
Now press with your feet firmly, but gingerly as not to break the glass.  I
pushed so hard, I thought the glass would break, The person on the outside
can assist in catching the pane when it pops out.  I used this technique on
a parts car I had, and got ALL the glass, including the windshield with no
breakage

Have Fun
