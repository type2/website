 Hey guys!! There is a bus up for sale. It is probably
not a good starter bus. It is a 57 double door it is
complete.it has the usual rust and the front end will
need work(cv's,bearings,etc...)but is a rolling
chassis. as far as know the #'s match. the engine is
in there but hasn't been run since the 70's original
motor 1300 or 1400? Ok now the only down fall is the
tail light modification they have cut out for larger
housings ford,chevy??? but I am sure they work! If any
body is interested post a message and I will give him
your name and number I believe he is asking $800.oo
