Subject: Anyone have any spare parts or know where to get them?

Hey, I've got a 74' bus and am wondering if anyone knows where I can obtain the following parts:
 
Passenger side mirror, driver side step mat, seatbelts, new windshield, sun visors, rear bumper, air conditioning,  jalousie windows, dashboard clock, hospital fans.
 
 
(the few things toward the end are just kind of an &quot;I wish I could have these&quot;, from air conditioning to hospital fans)
 
Anyone who can be of assistance would be great.
 
-Rob Meyer
