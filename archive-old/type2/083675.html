Subject: Farewell for now

This is my final email for a while &amp; I'm unsubscribing
simply because I don't have the time to read all of
the interesting stuff you guys send me.
I've learned stacks from the discussions &amp; debates &amp;
really enjoyed the insight into the U.S. bus scene.
So, as winter closes in Down Under, I wish you all a
good Summer &amp; encourage you to check out our nice land
sometime &amp; the die-hard VW addicts here.
Thanks for the patience, the advice &amp; the fun.
:-)
Cheers &amp; see ya' later!
