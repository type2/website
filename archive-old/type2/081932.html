Subject: Re: [T2] Rap on distributors

I'll catch flak for this, but an engine equipped with a 009 runs hotter than
one with the CORRECT advance curve for the engine going down the highway. VW
engines WANT 42-45 degrees of full advance at part throttle, retarding to 32
total at 1/2 to full throttle.

The 009 is fine for cars that only idle and drive full throttle, they suck
for everything in between. The reason for this is that proper ignition
timing is different based on engine load, and 009s are centrifugal only and
can not achieve different timing based on load.

009s are cheap and do work, just not well.
