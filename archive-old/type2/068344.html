Subject: Vendor comparison ( was: oh no! Parts Place on the list!!!!)

A week ago Saturday I ordered the new parts for my '64 engine rebuild
from three vendors: Vintage VW, Rocky Mountain Motorworks, and 
Wolfsburg West. I could have included Bus Boys, JCW and Parts Place in
this comparison, but either not having a catalog (BB), or disclaimers in
their catalogs about original parts (PP), or not getting a VW catalog to
me after six months (JCW) whatever, I decided against it. So consider
this a survey of specialized vendors that make a catalog or pricelist
available citing VW part numbers.

Back to the three. I built up a spreadsheet comparing prices on the
parts I needed, a found the bottom lines were similar, though there were
still differences on costs for individual items. I decided to comparison
shop for service and called each vendor, ordering those parts they
offered at the lowest price of the three. Total dollar value of the
orders was the vaguely the same.

Shipments arrived from all three vendors the same day, Monday, and all
the orders were complete, with one exception, RMMW's catalog promises a
detailed instruction sheet with their carburetor rebuild kit, but the
kit arrived without. I called their 800 number and they faxed the
instructions to me within 10 minutes of my call.

Generally, I was happy with the shipments from each vendor, and there 
were no other surprises -like when the sales person will &quot;have&quot; the item
in the computer, but when the stuff arrives you find it is backordered.

Vintage VW did have somethings that the others did not, a Type 2
40hp clean air muffler, and the bus exhaust tip that both RMMW and
WW said were &quot;out of stock - and nobody can get them&quot;; I'll also say
that with Vintage VW I felt the person taking my order knew more about
the things I was looking for.

Thats it for now,

Tom F.
