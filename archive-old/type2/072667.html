        I'm a screenprinter &amp; cook.  I don't have piles of $$$, but love my
VW's &amp; have 2 of 'em- '69 camperbus &amp; '69 beetle, plus a car for the
horrible minnesota winters.  The nice thing about VW's is you don't have to
be rich to own/drive/restore one &amp; people normally like your VW better than
those really expensive automobiles.
