Subject: 80 Vanagon odometer not working

It seems the P.O. must have reset the trip odometer while moving 1 too many
times. I got the shaft back into position with the gear engaged. Ran the
speedo at aprox. 20 mph with a variable speed drill. seemed to clock the miles
ok for about 15 miles then the gears locked up and the spur gear spun off the
shaft and got lost somewhere in my living room, ^&amp;*)&amp;^&amp;%^(   . I tried moving
the shaft the gear came off of using a small piece of vacuum hose. Found that
if I press slightly on the trip reset I can count up the miles ok, tried to
remove the MPH pointer so I could remove the dial face but no go! I wonder, is
there anything that can be done to repair this situation without trashing the
whole thing?

Looking for the lost gear
