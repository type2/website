Subject: long weekend trip!

We will be leaving tomorrow night around 11pm for a long weekend trip to
south Texas.  This trip will take us from Jonesboro, AR to Dallas, Waco,
Austin, San Antonio and finally to Uvalde.  Does anyone know of any VW
salvage yards etc. on the way that we could scrounge through?  We plan on
spending at least one day and night in Austin for fun and relaxation to make
a &quot;last of summer,Labor Day weekend&quot; out of it.  We will be driving our 1978
Westy (fiasco) sage green in color... if you see us along the way....
wave..... and we will wave back......
Hope everyone has a safe and happy holiday weekend.
Ken and Gail Doles
78 Westy
Jonesboro, AR
