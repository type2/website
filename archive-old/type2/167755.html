Subject: Re: [T2] Re: Popped valve seat picture

Richard,

Just went to a campout a couple of weekends ago in the bus.._dot_carrying
4 people and gear....two of the people were.....large.....

We got to taling about it as it was *up* a lot of hills and I had
to downshift a lot.  The last 5 miles were done on dirt roads at about 
20mph.

We figured we were at close to 1200-1500 lbs of people/stuff....and that 
was before I remembered that the A/C system alone probably added another
200 lbs.

I drove it to work twice after that and then filled up.

Gas mileage was 18.5mpg...I was thrilled cause I had really pushed it up 
and down the hills going and coming....and yes, I had the petal to the 
metal. Guys, I have *never* babied a VW engine...I have rebuilt waaaay too 
many of them.  I just took a T1 engine apart that I rebuilt in 1996.  I 
had about 56,000 *very* abused hard miles on it and it really did look 
good....except for the cam gear that got loose...1,000 miles after I 
turboed it.

When I checked my leak down, it wasn't bad at all...less than 1% or so, 
but my compression seemed really bad, therefore, my conclusion that the
CR on the heads was really low.

Cheers, dave

&gt; This lower level of efficiency is a common problem with budget rebuilds.
&gt;
&gt; I saw a rebuild from another budget rebuilder (JCS) and it only got 12mpg at 
&gt; 1300 miles after installation. The rebuilder assured the owner the numbers 
&gt; would improve as the engine broke in but they didn't. After a lot of 
&gt; expensive to install CDI etc the mileage only improved to 14mpg.
&gt;
  Compression numbers were in the low 120's iirc. I did a leak down test on it
  one day and every cylinder had a poor seal. I told the owner it would never
  get average bus mileage until it was rebuilt properly. I couldn't tell how
  good the ring seal was because so much air was escaping thru the valves.

&gt; Dave, what is the gas mileage with your engine?
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; I think they are following Boston Bob's advice:
&gt;
&gt; http://www.bostonengine_dot_com/articles/todaysfuels.html
&gt;

  So, I wonder what kind of compression ratio that George ended up with?
&gt;
&gt; I've seen them as low as 110psi before first run. If you load up a cylinder 
&gt; with oil just like you find after assembly but before firing you should see 
&gt; abnormally high readings but when they are this low to begin with, the engine 
&gt; will never run as well as the factory build did.
