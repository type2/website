Subject: CFM Carb ratings.

Greetings -

I am wondering if there is a way to determine the CFM (or metric equivalent)
of a 34-PICT-3 carb.

I have a modified one on my 1915DP, and it runs well, but it seems it's
running out of ooomph at about 3800-4000rpm, and won't rev past about
4400rpm. With the 091 gearing, it's still quite useable - I just upshift at
4K if I'm in a hurry ;)

The engine's got 2500 miles on the rebuild, and has a Scat 4061 (.396*270)
cam, which my mechanic said should easily run to 5000rpm. Stock sized
valves. Stock 1:1.1 lifters. Everything's adjusted pretty well.

I figure I'm sucking (1915 / 1584 =) 21 percent more air per RPM as a stock
motor. Conversely, if a 34-PICT-3 is good for 5000rpm on a 1584, is that why
my motor only wants to rev to ((1584 / 1915 =) .83 * 5000rpm =) 4135.77 RPM?

I'm still trying to talk myself into a pair of Kadrons, at the expense of
that gorgeous stock looking engine bay. Better yet, do we know if it's
reasonably possible to widen the inside of the 34-PICT-3 for a little more
airflow?

Thanks -
