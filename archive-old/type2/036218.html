Subject: Re: Brake Dilemma:'69 Westy...(long, but I need help!)

Chuck,

Yeah, I checked the price on wheel cylinders (from
Busdepot; my FLAPS is closed on Sundays) and they come
in at around $11.50 ea., average. But...multiply that
by 4 and add in $36.00 for front/rear pads + brake
fluid...we're at around $90.00 and I don't have it
right now (pretty pathetic, I know;-).


I *can* afford it next month, but I need to get by
'til then...that's what I was asking about in my post.


Also, I know that simply adding the pads would be a
waste of money, in that the pads would soon be trashed
by the brake fluid. I just figure that it's cheaper
than replacing the drum, as I'm pretty sure the rivets
*are* hitting the drum and I can't afford to do it all
properly at this time. I'm not positive the rivets are
rubbing, though.... I will check them tomorrow (who
knows, perhaps the VW Gods will smile upon me!).

I'm also pretty sure that the drums will all need
turning, as *every* one of them rubbed intermittently
after adjusting the brakes (just as a high-spot would
do). So now were getting closer to $130.00...and I
know there'll be some hidden costs too ;-) I figure
closer to $150.00 before it's all done.

Thanks!


Jaime

&gt; dont do it wheel cyl are so cheap most don't even
&gt; bother to rebuild them. 
&gt; We're talking less than $10 bucks. If their leaking
&gt; what will happen is they 
&gt; will contaminate the new shoes and you will have
&gt; wasted that money plus they 
&gt; will be wet and won't stop worth a damn. Now a leak
&gt; won't ruin your drum, 
&gt; what will is if the shoes are allowed to go to far
&gt; and the rivits will gouge 
&gt; your drum. If the gouge is too deep the drum cant be
&gt; turned and now its junk. 
&gt; If you hear the noise at only one spot, what you've
&gt; got is a high spot on the 
&gt; drum. I'd advice three things
&gt; 1 have your drums checked for trueness, if they need
&gt; to be turned it runs 
&gt; about $8 per drum, if they don't need it don't turn
&gt; em
&gt; 2 replace the wheel cyls as a set, their too cheap
&gt; not too
&gt; 3 if moneys real tight, save it on the shoes, often
&gt; a shop might have a 
&gt; single side of a set or a slightly used set. adj the
&gt; shoes till the drum is 
&gt; tight and then back off the adj a couple of turns. 
&gt; thats my story and I'm stickin to it ymmv
