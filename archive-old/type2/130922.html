Subject: Re: [T2] Belly Pan Question

I have a 79 with an auto tranny that also has no belly pan. Does it have 
anything to do with the auto tranny. Also, I am planning on installing a gas 
heater. do i need a belly pan then?


&gt; &gt; &gt; 1977 Westfalia Deluxe, Auto Transmission, Air
&gt; &gt; Conditioned, &quot;No Belly Pan&quot;
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Should there be one there?
&gt;
&gt;   I've got belly pans under my 77 and 78 westies
&gt;and both have no gas heaters.
