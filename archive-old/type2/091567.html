NO! DANGER!  Ever looked at even a dirt-cheap pair of jumper cables? The
worst one's I've seen were made out of 8 gauge cable. The average pair
seem to be made of 6 gauge.  Good cables are made of 4 gauge.  I've seen a
set that were built from 2 gauge cable...but they were 40 foot long, too.

Now.  What's your cig lighter hooked up to the battery with? 16, maybe 18
gauge wire?  Do you really want to have the 200+- or so amps that the
starter draws pulled across even 12 gauge wire?  Sounds like a fast way to
a burned VW.
