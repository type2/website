Subject: Re: banging in new rebuild

Diagnosing engine sounds over a text-based medium is one of the hardest 
things in the world.  If your &quot;banging sound&quot; is maybe mor like a loud 
&quot;ticking&quot; sound, that is in more in the higer frequencies and IF IT GOES 
AWAY shortly after start up, then it might be nothing more than a lifter 
that's not pumping up.

&gt; I have an AVP rebuild, 2.0 L, hydraulic lifters in my '78 Westy that has
&gt; about 3,000 miles on it. I broke it in as described in the Wilson book
&gt; and it's been running great. But the other day I started her up and
&gt; noticed more noise than usual from the engine. It can best be described
&gt; as a consistent banging sound, over and above normal noises. I tried to
&gt; hunt it down and it sounded like it was coming from the vicinity of the
&gt; #2 cylinder. After pulling the valve cover, I noticed that the #2
&gt; exhaust valve seems to be moving less than the others on this side while
&gt; running. Any ideas? Thanks!
