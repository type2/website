&gt; Maybe part of the purpose would be to cover the MOST miles and utilize the
&gt; MOST listees to carry the baton.  Zig Zag that sucker all over the place!
&gt; Encourage use of back roads and scenic routes - that's what buses are best
&gt; for anyway (no back-tracking or 'circling' allowed).  It would also enable
&gt; more people to be involved, not just the ones on the 'shortest' route from
&gt; coast to coast.  Maybe even award bonus points if there are 2 or more buses
&gt; traveling together for portions of the rally.

Great idea Mike!
   Count me in (if I manage to get the '78 Westy put together by the time it
happens...so much to do, so little free time...&quot;late to bed, early to rise, work
like hell....&quot;)

   Anyhow, I live about 45 minutes from Mike G., out in the country west of San
Antonio, could park a few busses here or might be able to talk my neighbor with
the 500 acre ranch into letting a hoard park next to his lake...just gotta watch
out for cow pies.
