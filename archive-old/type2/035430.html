Subject: Re: '70 Vs '77 Drivability impressions

I have owned a 70, 74, 77, and 79.

The &quot;power&quot; seems to be exactly the same on each of them.

I do find that the 70 has the best shifting, hands down, although once 
properly adjusted the shifting on the 79 was ok.  Not when cold though.

All in all the 70 has been the most reliable as well as the most inexpensive 
to maintain.

Seems like I was ALWAYS fiddling with the 79, whereas with the 70 I really 
have no need whatsover to open up the engine hatch.  Really maintenance free 
in the past 6 months....6000 miles.

Fingers crossed,
