Subject: Valve Job Questions

hey now,

well, today i did my first valve job by myself with no supervision from folks
who are experience veterans! i already had tdc marked and i know i got that
right. #1 was a bit loose but not bad. fixed that. #2 was okay. on #3 on valve
was a bit tight. fixed that. #4 was a tad loose so i tightened. i guess i'm a
a bit paranoid after doing it by myself. if i did something wrong, like
tightened or loosend a tad too much, is there any indications from the running
of the engine that i could tell? i triple checked everything and took about an
hour and a half. i followed the procedure and it went smoothly. guess i'm just
paranoid! :-)
