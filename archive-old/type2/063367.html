Subject: Rolled bus in Milw
In this morning's (Monday) Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel, p. 3B, there is a
picture of rolled bus. The caption says it collided with a car. It looks
like a bread loaf, one color, dark. It's got WI collector plates (59726).
The caption says that the driver was taken to the hospital and was in
stable condition as of Sunday evening. In the picture, the bus is lying on
the driver's side, with the windshield broken, presumably done to get the
driver out.

Those of us who believe in such things might consider remembering this
driver in our prayers.
