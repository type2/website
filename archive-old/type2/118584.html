Subject: Accelerator goes all the way to the floor ??? 

Got in the bus this morning to head to the park , gave the accelerator a
little push , it went all the way to the floor and stayed there. Went bak to
the engine and had to raise the lingage back up (Pict 34) so that the
accelrator would come back up.

Any ideas? IT's connected but went I push on the accelerator it stays at the
bottom. It's not broken:the cabe that is... I had the cable replaced about a
year ago..

Thanks..
