Subject: Re: [T2] Ball joint work

&gt; &amp; yes, apparently there is a special fitting needed to
&gt; press the new balljoints in.

list,

someone mentioned that a master machinist can make the mandrels needed to
press the ball joints in and out.

i am not a master machinist, but i rolled my own mandrels, it is easy if you
are so inclined and have a bit of metalwork experience. i looked at the
photos, and brought the BallPoint to my local metal supermarket and got some
appropriate sized heavy wall tubing and heavy steel bar. the mandrels can be
approximated with only straight cuts, no machining. the total cost was under
10 bucks.

germansupply_dot_com now has a set of the real VW ones, and i can verify that my
home made ones are not much different, and they have worked perfectly for a
few people, as i have lent them out a couple of times.
