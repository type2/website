 I am continuing my work on my DP to SP conversion.The heat riser from the SP
 engine is plugged beyond belief. I have worked on it from both ends with
 wire then aircraft cable on the end of a drill ( had to stop for a while and
 go buy an electric drill as my cordless could not keep up the pace). I
 finally stopped when I found that if I blew on the end, air came out around
 the aluminum sleeve on the same side. What have I done?
================
you made a hole in the heat riser.  sucks, huh?   Get another from a friend 
or at a swap.

 Also, what if I have to put this engine back into the 1971 bus? What will I
 do for a brake booster connection?
----------------
there are sp intakes with the large spout for the brake booster-  on throat 
under carb points to left.   plug it off if not attached to brake booster or 
you get an intake leak.

also there are these adaptors you can put  on the intake under the carb and 
plug the brake booster to it.   I have a couple, want one?
