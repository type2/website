Subject: Resistances of a coil make a big difference in performance?

Hi,
I was checking the resisitance of my coil and noticed that the reading between
1 and 15 on the coil was about 1 ohm above spec (4.2 Ohms). Since the spec is
so small, I am quessing that 1 ohm could make a difference or is my thinking
just a little to uptight?
Thanks.
