Subject: Re: [T2] master cylinder or booster?

Check this out:

There is a nice animation on this page:

I think that you have a leak in your booster.  Not too big of one, but
enough to hear the hissing.

I think that your hard spot is a worn spot probably in your master cylinder,
but maybe in a caliper or wheel cylinder.  I also could be a worn spot on
the booster that you need push beyond to overcome the leak.

&gt; When I put the brakes on in the westy (1979), I get a hissing noise from
&gt; underneath and there is also I tight spot on the brake pedal when you put
&gt; the brakes on. It goes down normally and starts to brake a bit, then there
&gt; is a harder spot (to push), then it gets past that and is easier to push
&gt; again. There is a hissing too so I'm thinking the booster?? The brakes work
&gt; great though. Any thoughts on this?
