Subject: RE:new bus nightmare

hello all,
ive read all the comments and do have my own opinions
on the matter, but i feel that we should leave this
matter to the people in question.   except for the
buyer and seller, none of us were their to hear the
phone conversations or test drive the bus or take that
last drive until it gave up the ghost.   since both
parties are listmembers, i think it best to let them
handle their own dealings, as we are a sort of family
on here and i would hate to see a great list get tied
up in he said she said crap.   the buyer/seller i
assume are both good people and it will all work out
in the end.   it is an unfortunate situation, but one
that needs to be worked out in private.   just my $.02
