Subject: Re: [T2] Being sued by VWoA, what to do?

Do you have an address for VWoA associated with this? I know I'd like to 
give them a piece of my mind. This is simply bullying on the part of their 
legal department. It makes the company look slimy - almost as bad as 
Microsoft!

&gt; Hey all, well after we got back from the Campbelltown show today, there
&gt; was a letter in the mailbox from an attorney in Indy.  First off, about
&gt; 2 years ago, I had made a clock out of an old vw hubcap of mine,
&gt; drilling a hole in the center of the cap, and buying a clock movement
&gt; from the craft store, and I had gave this as a gift to a friend of mine
&gt; for christmas. After i knew it was a hit as a gift, I had tried to sell
&gt; a few from our web page here on webtv. we might have sold one or two,
&gt; and traded a few for live music. Now this letter states we will need to
&gt; pay them $3000 by May 15th for damages of using the VW name without
&gt; authorization. And if we dont get that to them by that date, they can
&gt; sue us for up to 3x that amount. Which is absolutely absurd. The reason
&gt; I am bringing this to the lists attention is if I remember correctly,
&gt; some time ago someone else was being sued or something to that affect.
&gt; If anyone can help us out, we would totally appreciate it. After all,
&gt; isnt all that stuff we sell at the swaps unauthorized? Thanks for your
&gt; time...Brian
