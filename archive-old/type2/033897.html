Subject: Looking for a Westfalia.

Hello all!

  I'm looking to treat myself this christmas, and have set my heart on a
Westfalia.  I currently have a standard '74 Bus, M/T and a Type IV engine.

  I'm looking to spend between $500-1000.  I want this to be something
that I can put a lot of work into.  If you know of anything, or are
looking to get sell you baby to a good home, please let me know.

  Hope the holidays are treating everyone well.

may act their dream with open eyes, and make it possible.&quot;
