Subject: Shock removal

Hey folks,
Anyone know of a good way to get the bottom bolt out in order to remove my
shocks? Is there a good puller for this?  The top ones came out easily
enough, but the bottom ones will hardly budge with a socket.  They are
currently soaking in oil.

Ned

PS Can someone tell me the address of the vanagon list? Cant seem to find it
and need to post for a friend.  Thanks, Ned
