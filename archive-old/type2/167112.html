Subject: Broken manual trans in sf help w shop/tow.

Dear members

My 1980 aircool vanagon's manual trans has broken down I couldn't get it to 
go in1st or2nd nd its making alot of clonking noise. Its at the fort mason 
marina parking lot so if any of you in sf area can direct me to a tow/shop I 
would be eternaly grateful The harbor master helped me get the van out of 
traffic and wants it towed by tonight 10pm when they lock the gate. I am at 
the HI hostel which is out of beds so I need to solve that as well.

cheers
jan
