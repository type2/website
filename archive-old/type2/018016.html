    I've hauled goats in my '69 bus. Everytime we stopped at a stopsign
or whatever,the goat would pee, so somebody sat behind her with a coffee
can to catch the pee. 
    I've also picked up some pretty damn strange hitchhikers. 
And once filled the midsection, including the rear seat, with firewood
up to the window levels, but that was a serious mistake, the weight was
so bad it damaged the clutch taking off.
