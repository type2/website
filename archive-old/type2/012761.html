Well for those of you following my saga of &quot;backfire on #3 Cylinder&quot;.

The engine I'm discussing is a 1970cc, FI engine in an 83 Westfalia.

After about fifteen minutes of checking everything I could check under
the car with the valve covers off I decided to pull the engine and put it
on my workbench.

With the engine dead cold &quot;45 degrees outside&quot; before i pulled it out, 
I'm getting 90Psi on 1,2,4 cylinders, I get 70 Psi on number 3 cylinder.

I hadn't  gotten it to run well enough since it started backfiring to get
the engine warm emough for a &quot;engine warm: compression check.

Here are the questions:

After I have installed the new rings and oiled each cylinder.

What compression PSI would be ideal or expected after a new ring
installation?
Keeping in mind that the compression check will be done first with a cold
engine.

After initial cranking of the engine and with the engine up to operating
temperature, what would be the ideal or desirable cylinder PSI?

Does it help / hurt anything to leave off the shims (seals) at the base
of the cylinders?

I read in the archives where people are getting compression readings of
125 to 135 PSI.

I've never had more than 120 PSI when the engine had been run it for four
hours and tested warm. There was only about 2-3 PSI variance on my
compression check on the new engine.

Is this 120-PSI low because of the shims or just the 7.4: 1 compression?

After searching the archives I'm totally confused about compression, but
Bentley states that 90 PSI is acceptable on a well run engine with many
miles on it but 87 PSI is not.

I installed a short block that was rebuilt by VW in Canada 35,000 miles
ago. I installed new cylinder heads. The instructions with the cylinder
heads states &quot;do not use head gaskets with these heads&quot;, so naturally I
didn't.

The documentation that came with my short block states that all Rod, Main
bearings and cylinders and pistons are standard.

Here is what I've found so far.
Each cylinder has one shim under it.
Number 3 cylinder appears to have been running hot. (Burned oil on
cylinder head inside the valve cover). # 3 Piston top looks good just a
little sooty. No burnt looking valves. Normal residue under valves. SOFT
SOOT not hard.
All valve seats in both heads appear to be tight.
No signs of detonation on either cylinder head.
Cylinders heads have mostly nice carbon except # 3 is kind of sooty.
Spark plugs all fairly nice except # 3, which is sooty.
All barrels appear to have been sealing tight and have no appearance of
leakage at the cylinder head seal.

The pistons are all marked as standard and I plan to bust the glaze off
of all cylinders and install new rings after I have the cylinders
measured for oval and barrel symptom checked.

I've been satisfied with the performance on this engine; in most cases I
can take minor hills at 70 to 75 without loss of speed reaching the top.
(I'm in Texas not very hilly).

On the hills I climb that have passing lanes for fast traffic I normally
experience about a 4-8 MPI drop in speed when I go in at 65-70 MPI. (No
headwind or tailwind)

Texas Fuels is sold in two varieties in all grades. 
Big city type has more water and some exotic anti-pollutant chemicals.
Outside the big cities the fuel does not have as much of the
anti-pollutants.
I've noticed smoother running and more power when I use the non-city
fuels.

I include this in this document because I'd like to find out why one
cylinder would exhibit signs of failure.

I respect that VW air-cooled have specific characteristics attributable
only to VW's but I think an engine rebuilt properly should be relatively
trouble free for 50,000 miles, baring abuse or negligence.

I've never revved my engine over 4,000 RPM's and keep this as a shift
point when entering freeway traffic.

Since I've had 35,000 trouble free miles I'm assuming that I'm doing
things right.
