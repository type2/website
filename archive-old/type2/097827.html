Subject: Re: [T2] measurement still needed

In a message dated 10/4/02 12:41:31 PM, brandthart_at_hotmail_dot_com writes:

&lt;&lt; I need to know how far it is down from the bottom of the front grill to 
the 
edge of the emblem. If anyone has a 73-79 with the emblem I would greatly 
appriciate a measurement. I'd get it myself but not too many busses in my 
small town and most have the spare tire up front.

Thanks,
Brandt &gt;&gt;

4 3/8 inches on mine...But wait to get another measurement just to be sure...
