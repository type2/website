Subject: Re: [T2] Pistons pins removal, Any trick!

&gt; Hi guys,
&gt; Well, as expected (same on my other engine) all pistons pins are
&gt; somewhat stuck, they turn freely in the piston and in the rod bushing
&gt; but they won't come out easily pass the C-Ring.

Take any steel instrument with a sharp square edge (medium screwdriver is
fine) and remove the burr on the outer side of the snap ring groove.  Then
the pistion pin will slide out easily.

&gt; I have a few puller and extractor but nothing soft enough so i don't
&gt; damage the piston!

You can make a very satisfactory and gentle extractor from a piece of
1/4 inch all-thread, an 11mm socket, a piece of PVC pipe slightly larger
and longer than the piston pin, a fender washer, and a couple of nuts.

Put a nut on the all-thread.  Run the socket on the all-thread from the
long end and seat it on the nut,  run the all-thread through the piston
pin, through the PVC pipe, and through the fender washer.  Add a nut,
center the whole thing up, and start tightening the nut by the fender
washer.  The socket will push the pin into the PVC pipe.
