Hi Tom,

That bumpy coating under your bus is probably an asphalt-based spray-coating
which is used to help protect the bus from stone-chips and deaden the sound
at the same time. At least that's the case with my '79.

&quot;One-Step&quot; prefers to be applied to clean, grease-free surfaces. Applying it
to road grime or asphault under-spray won't do a thing, you have to clean it
and give it time to dry first.

Bring on the Pressure Washer!!!!

&gt;&gt; A much better, modern solution is a product like Mar-Hyde's &quot;One-step&quot;. It's
&gt;&gt; similiar to POR-15 as far as I've been told. It's available in a spray or
&gt;&gt; liquid...
&gt; 
&gt; Now, with something like &quot;One-step&quot; or any other underbody
&gt; treatment, would you pressure wash the bottom of the bus
&gt; to remove all the gunk down there first?  Looking at the
&gt; bottom of my bus, there already seems to be a coating
&gt; (which is flaking off in places and under which I can see the
&gt; original paint) and I'm not sure if that coating is a rust-proof
&gt; coating or just lots of sand/mud/etc. that's been caked on for years.
&gt; 
&gt; Any thoughts on the prep work and/or how easy it is to apply
&gt; something like &quot;one-step&quot;?
