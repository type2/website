Subject: Re: [T2] AC

As I was browsing through old repair bills for the Golf I noticed that
a CA licensed repair shop had charged 35$ for &quot;Free ON&quot; recharge. That
is pretty cool joke given that it wasn't free, the AC still wasn't ON
after the repair and it wasn't freon altogether like we learned
recently. The car is a 1995 and uses R-134a (Tetrafluoroethane)
instead of R-12.

That shop had kindly offered to install a new compressor (555$) and a
new expansion valve (145$) + labor cost. That comes to about half the
cost of the car.
