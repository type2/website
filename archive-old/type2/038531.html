Subject: Re: Automatic to Standard conversion

I was entertain the idea of converting my auto to std. but decided against it.
A std trans won't cost that much be all the other stuff starts to add
up(pedals, cables and change over at flywheel side) ends up costing a good bit
more than a rebuilt auto.
Check out the prices at Strictly foreign I think about $700 for rebuilt auto.

This is just opinion

&gt; Hi All

&gt; I'm looking to buy a '73 Riviera Campmobile with auto trans.  The
&gt; transmission seems faulty since you have to manually move it from 1 to 2
&gt; then to D.  If you try to start off at D it just chugs along.  So I'm
&gt; looking at having the transmission rebuilt and I'm wondering if I might as
&gt; well just replace it with a standard.  Is this an easy swap???
&gt;
&gt; Thanks
