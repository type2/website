Subject: wide fives on a trailer

I'd like to build a trailer which uses the wide five lug wheels like on the
early buses.

Does anyone make adapters to put the wide five wheel on a standard (ch*vy)
hub - I've seen adapters to go the other way (ch*vy wheel on a wide five hub).

Otherwise, anyone know of another way?

Thanks,
Dean
