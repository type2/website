Hi listees,

I'll be heading S to Baja California in a few weeks and am wondering if 
we have any list members in living in Baja or with long term experience 
in that part of 
the world. If so, I would like to get in touch with you to get some 
information, 
off line, about VW bus maintenance, parts availability and prices.

Thanks for your help.
