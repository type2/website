In my 72 Bus I had years ago, my heater boxes were rusted a little bit, and
the leaking pushrod tubes would leak oil into the heater boxes and put a
nice thick smoke into the cabin.  So I always had the heater boxes turned
off, even in the coldest of Chicago winters.  But not to worry, as I had a
wonderful gas heater that did more than a fair job.

So if your engine is shot, maybe the oil is just from leaking prt's.

&gt;hello list,
&gt;I am in the middle of a rebuild and noticed that about a half quart of old
&gt;black oil drained out of the heat exchangers that are standing up along the
&gt;wall in my garage.  Lots of blow-by hey?  What should I do about cleaning
&gt;them or shouldn't I worry about it?  I don't want to have to worry about it
&gt;(got enough to worry about with the engine and tranny being shot).
&gt;
&gt;Thanks,
&gt;Adam
