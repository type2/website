Subject: Re: [T2] towing capacity

Hi Folks,

The 1600dp engine has a tough enough time pushing a 12' bus that weighs 2800 
pounds.  I think a rig with a total length of 30' and a total weight of 5000 
pounds will be too much for the little engine.  You might be able to get it 
going on flat ground with no wind, but keeping it at any kind of speed up 
any kind of hill will shortly produce lots of nasty noises from your engine, 
followed by a spectacular explosion of magnesium and steel alloy.

Pulling a 16' trailer that weighs 1700 pounds *is* possible with a Bus, but 
the Bus needs a big engine and the trailer needs good brakes.  In addition, 
the transmission needs to be solid, the Bus brakes need to be tip-top, and 
the driver must be *very* careful maneuvering this rig.  Even then, it's a 
pretty risky endeavor.

If you must have this particular travel trailer, consider pulling it with 
something (even) more substantial than a Bus.  That said, your mileage may 
vary.

Good Luck!
