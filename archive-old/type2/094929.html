Subject: Limbo lost in Limbo.....and rambling......

When I had a 63 or had my 67's, it was easy, I had type2 vintage list to 
look at.
Now I am restoring a 1970 &quot;Sundowner&quot; westy. (Is there another term for 
that?) So I am using this list. But its full of busses that are not like 
mine; type 4 engines, disc brakes, weird and sorry to say this, but poorly 
made westy interiors. I mean please do you like flourescent lighting?

I guess, in the end, I am on the right list, so could someone tell me how 
hard it would be to put a  1979 tranny into a 1970 bus? I like the gear 
ratio and the strength of the tranny. Mine pops out of fourth, and its of 
course loud when cruising at 65.

I have been reading about corvair conversions, and although that seems like 
a good idea, I have been more interested in putting in a diesel engine. Good 
tourque, and I would use bio-diesel fuel.

Until that time, I will continue to use a bug engine 1776 with dual carbs, 
and a mild cam plus a type four oil cooler. I am getting about the same HP 
as a corvair so why change. Also I use a full flow filter and racing oil. 
Makes a difference with oil pressure. By the way my fuel  economy is about 
21 city, so I am amazed, no difference from my 1600 or my 1641. Which of 
course could lead into a long diatribe about engine size vs economy, but i 
digress.

The bus is comming along, with a new painted floor (hammerite), all new 
baltic birch panels and wood floor (backs of which are soaked in linseed 
also called flax seed oil to repel water). Looks very nice, although I 
wonder if I am wasting time, since its not a pop top which I sorely miss (my 
old 69 long since gone was a westy poptop). Still this bus has custom wheels 
and low profile hard side wall tires, handles like a dream (complete front 
end rebuild) and NO WAY IN HELL WOULD I LOWER IT. Thank you kindly.
The entire kit inside is westy, taking three sink cabinets apart to make one 
nice one, cleaning seats, etc. I have mosquito net, the little stool, the 
piece that fits over the spare wheel well. But I miss the netting above the 
back seat, the &quot;headache&quot; cabinet is not nearly as cool or functional when 
you think about it.
On the other hand, this bus is rust free, very unusual for the PNW (sitting 
for about 5 years), and will get painted this weekend. I have been trying to 
convince the wife that it should be painted the same as our '60 bug, a one 
year only color, ceramic green.

BTW as far as reliability goes, the volkswagen used to be considered the  
best. I took a 1969 that had sit for 15 yrs and within 1 week had a daily 
driver that I put 2000 miles on it the next weekend without incident. I also 
had a 1963 bus that I rewired and threw in an engine that had sat outside 
for 4 years (the engine!) for a 3,000 mile trip (over the continental divide 
four times- pictures of it at 8,000 ft) and it drove flawlessly. Its all 
about prep, and guessing before you leave what might go wrong: points, 
wires, condensor, rotor, cap, etc. In fact I believe (stupidly of course) so 
strongly that the VW will fail close to home only, that I didnt even carry a 
spare tire.

I havent had forums in ages, so sorry about the rambling.....
