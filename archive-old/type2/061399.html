I'm looking at buying a 77 bus with an automatic transmission and an air
conditioner.
Does anyone have any experience with the reliability of an automatic?  Is
there a source for overhaul later if needed?  What about parts availability
for the automatic and the A/C?  Is there a source for A/C compressors and
other parts?  I don't really care about whether the vehicle has an automatic,
so how easy is it to replace with a manual if needed?  I do care very much,
being in Texas, about the A/C.  What about reliability on the A/C?  Finally
can this entire 2.0 Type 4 engine/transmission/A/C be transplanted to a 68?
Fit problems?
