Subject: [T2] Leaking distributer??

I have a 71 1600 dp
34pict3
vacuum advance dist.  I am leaking on the left side of my engine case.  I 
had that happen before, but it was my carbs throttle shaft.  So I got a new 
carburetor.  But now its leaking again.  it looks like its from the base of 
the distributer(at the case).  I guess it could be from the gasket at the 
fuel pump flange(black plastic thing) but I just tigtened the bolts on the 
fuel pump and its leaking more down the left of the case than to the right 
of the fuel pump. It is a little moist at the base of the distributer butI 
just got a new &quot;pinch clamp&quot; on the distributer and a new bolt on it as well 
as a new distributer shortly before that.  I tightened the bolt that 
attaches the distributer to the case and the pinch bolt clamp again just a 
second ago.

Is it possible that I am missing a gasket or seal at the base of the 
distributer?  I wouldn't think my mechanic forgot or reused the seal when he 
put on the new pinch clamp and replaced distributer. but then again...

Also how to I get to that front bolt on the fuel pump the one towards the 
fan shroud, the hard one to reach :)  ....

I have a feeling your all gonna tell me I have to remove my distributer and 
check for the gasket and tighten that fuel pump bolt then huh...??

TIA

Kim and Mike
