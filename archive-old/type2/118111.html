Subject: Re: [T2] Distributor gear question

Hello Bill  The easiset way to install the dizzy drive is to put it and the 
dizzy in before you put the crank in and then put the two halfs together. Set 
the drive at the desired place,install the dizzy and clamp it in place. now 
hold the crank with the number one rod up at the highest point and dropp into the 
case . This should be TDC check the timing marks on the crank gear, they 
should be on top.rotate a quarter turn so that you can line up the cam mark with 
the crank marks. Then bolt the two halfs together. doing after you bolt the 
case halfs together just makes the job harder. Later and have fun  Mark Dearing
