&gt; 
&gt; Also, I would stay away from that LUCAS coil. You are likely to pick up an 
&gt; electric or fuel infection from some British car and spread it to your 69 
&gt; Bus. Friends dont let friends use Lucas parts on their cars. just my 
&gt; 2cents &lt;G&gt;
&gt; 
My '66 TR4A was full of them LUCAS parts.  Had to spend a day on it 
for every day of use.  Didn't LUCAS also produce a sci-fi movie 
series?

Not being FRYDAY yet.......
