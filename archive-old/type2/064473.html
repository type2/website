&gt; &gt; hey, jonathan, thanks for all your sarcasm. actually, i could probably
&gt; &gt; get $7000 for it if i had the time to wait around. let's see: the new
&gt; &gt; engine was $3500, the brakes $800, the oil cooler, $300 the tires $150,
&gt; &gt; the kenwood system $600. that's $5350 right there, assuming that the rest
&gt; &gt; of the vehicle has no value. i never gave it any thought, but i suppose
&gt; &gt; these vans are in much greater demand out here. they are EXTREMELY
&gt; &gt; popular all along the west coast: SF, Boulder, Santa Cruz, Seattle...
&gt;
&gt; Maybe I've been spoiled doing my own work, but $3500 for an engine????
&gt; $800 for the brakes???
&gt; and holy cow, $300 for an oil cooler that I can get for like $50????
&gt; Do these prices seem incredibly high to anyone else? For $800, I hope every
&gt; single component of the brake system was replaced.
&gt; This is not intended as a personal attack at all, I am just amazed at the level
&gt; of expense....
&gt; Sheesh, I could rebuild my engine at least 3 times from scratch for that
&gt; amount.
&gt; Just another reason to stay with my trusty '67....
&gt;   I rebuilt the entire brake system, paid for the bus itself, put in a new
&gt; engine, then rebuilt the bottom end, put in new carb, distributor, and all that
&gt; stuff, completely rebuilt the interior, paneling, curtains, etc.. new drag
&gt; link, and a bunch of other stuff I don't recall off the top of my head for
&gt; right about $2500. I could probably actually sell my bus for more than that, if
&gt; it didn't have that lovely red, white, and blue paint job.
&gt; Anyway, I'd love to hear other's bus costs...

Yeah, I was thinking the same exact thing-$800 for brakes boggles my mind.
I can't imagine what was done.  I've never even had to pay that much for a
complete car.  I can't even visualize the sum of $3500-isn't that like
what a house costs?  Well, at least you got the tires for cheap:)

For Richard: Ummm, let me try to figure out my costs so far (the bus is
still &quot;in process&quot;, like we say in the library business but not for much
longer.
'66 Westy (complete but a bit rusty)-   $400
full length roof rack                   $ 75
brake lines and hoses                   $ 32
brake shoes                             $ 12
master cylinder                         $ 25
two tires                               $ 90
gas tank boiled and repaired            $ 90
fuel lines, gaskets, tune up stuff      $ 40

total                                   $764

I'm sorry but I can't put a price on my labor, I do it for the joy of
getting greasy (right).

Well, I guess it comes close to $800 but this bus has never been hit and
the windshields aren't cracked.  I admit that I still will have a few more
expenses (hey, out there, I need a headlight assembly!) but not many and
then I will have a fine looking and running Splitty Westy Poptop.  What
more could I ask for? (yeah, a convertible Ghia)

Disclaimer: this is not meant to be a flame for anyone out there (I know
that there are some ultra-sensitive folk on the list) so I apologize in
advance if I hurt your feelings.
