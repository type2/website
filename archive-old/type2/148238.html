Subject: Pinging?

For those who may remember following my 72 repair topic, when I got
the Porsche 914 motor in it, I couldn't get it started even though it
was electrically excellent before pulling the old motor.

Rather than troubleshoot it, I threw in an 009 with an electronic
ignition that was running well on anothe motor, which got me running
and got the bus home.

I didn't get great performance and got some pinging, which I
attributed to the 009 bringing in the advance prematurely, so the
other day I finally installed the Mallory I had bought for it quite
some time ago.

With initial timing at 7 BTDC I got total advance at 30 degrees. I got
immediate performance improvement, but pinging at more than 1/2
throttle. So I kept retarding it in gradual increments until I was a
good 5 or 10 ATDC, but surprisingly was not able to get rid of the
pinging, but only changed the behavior of the pinging. It would ping
at WOT, then it would ping at initial throttle, then it would ping at
mid throttle. Finally I went back to the initial 7 BTDC where I can
give it some umph and move on out briskly as long as I don't exceed
1/2 throttle.

Any ideas?

John
