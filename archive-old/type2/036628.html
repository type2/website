Good Morning,
     Just a reminder to all those in the N. VA/ Wash. DC metro area of the VW 
Bus Round Up tomorrow, the 26th, at the old Hechingers parking lot in 
Leesburg VA. An informal gathering of bus/camper owners, all types/years, to 
meet one another and decide if there is any interest in making this a regular 
thing. Ruby Tuesdays is right next door, plus several fast food places across 
the street. On a side note, I don't think I've ever ordered one of those 
CD/tape deals you see on TV all the time, 'til last week. I saw one &quot;Spirit 
of the 60's&quot;, just had to have it. It came Wednesday ( skip the 2 day 
shipping _at_ $6.95 + the regular shipping _at_$5.95, mine came in less than a 
week). An excellent assortment of 60's rock, perfect for cruising in your 
bus/Westy. Take care,   Jeff


PS - If you need directions to the Bus Round-Up, email me.
