Subject: Starter Checkout Procedure

Hello all,

I'm looking for a starter motor checkout procedure I found a while ago.  =
No
luck in the library or archives; I think it was on a VW related site and =
I
just can't find it (new computer, lost old bookmarks).  It's NOT a hard
starting problem; the procedure I saw was a functional check of a bus
starter that independently checked whether the motor turned by itself,
whether the shaft actuated properly, etc. all with clear, specific
instructions on what (electrical) connections to make to the starter.  =
It
was all in less than a full sheet of paper.  I used it once and now have
another starter I want to check out.  Does anybody remember anything =
like
this?  If so, could you please let me know where I can find it too (and =
post
the address to the list so everyone else can benefit from it).

Thanks,

Markus Bahnemann
