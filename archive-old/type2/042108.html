+AD4-It's interesting to note that cigarette lighter sockets are getting more
+AD4-numerous even as ash trays are going the way of the dodo.  Lots of
+AD4-electronic devices to plug in+ACE-  Too bad that they can't standardize on
+AD4-something smaller and less clunky, like the original VW outlet+ACE-


However what you can now get is a dinky little two pin plug and socket which
is easy to install anywhere. I've got a couple, one up in the elevating roof
for a portable fluorescent tube on a 6 foot cable, and one the front of the
master cylinder compartment for charging my phone. For that you can get a
cigarette lighter socket  with a trailing cable about 6 inches long and a 2
pin plug on. You plug a standard charger cable from the phone into the cig
socket which goes to the 2 pin, and can keep it handily under the seat.

See your RV dealer.
