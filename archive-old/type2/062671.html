Subject: Gas Heater

I don't know if anyone's interested, but I'm thinking about selling the original, complete gas heater from my 69 westy (still installed).  I don't use it, but  that shouldn't stop it from warming someone's toes. As it stands now, it's just taking up valuable space in the tail end of my bus.
So if you have an interest, email back.

69 Westy (warm enough for me)
