Subject: MPG Woes...

Ok, here's the scoop...I'm getting really crappy gas mileage right now.
Vehicle is a 1977 Westfalia 2.0L. 12-13mpg in the city (ok, the city is San
Francisco) maybe 15-16 highway. I just filled up tonight and out of 160
miles of driving, 60 were highway, the rest city. It took 13 gallons. I am
not a leadfoot driver.

        The engine has about 10,000 miles on new P's and C's and rebuilt
heads from Mark Stephens. The oil temp usually reads between 180-215 tops.
Compression last time I checked was about 130-135 on all four. I recently
took it in and had a shop double check the timing for me, and they said
they also adjusted the airbox. I put 92 octane gas in it (new California
gas, probably accounts for some of the problem).

        What can I do, check, adjust, fix etc... to get better MPG? Is this
normal? Seems pretty depressing that friends with big V8 engined vehicles
can get almost as good or even better mileage than me. I'm getting
interested in checking into the Subaru engine swap thinking that the more
powerful engine would be under less strain and get better MPG? Anyways, any
and all advice is greatly appreciated as to getting better MPG. I mean
we're thinking about selling our VW as gas here is so expensive now. Thanks
again!   Tom
