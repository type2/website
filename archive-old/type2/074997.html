Subject: swivel seat conversion kit

hello all,

my friend is zany for swivel seats. i can get shreaks
of excitement out of her with just the statement,
&quot;swivel seats&quot;. she is so nutty for this amenity that
she has offered to buy me the swivel seat conversion
kit from eurocampers. will this work in a bay? does
any one have experience with this? i know that it is
meant for vanagons, which is why is ask. i would hate
to have my friend waste her money, so any input will
be greatly appreciated!

Matty
