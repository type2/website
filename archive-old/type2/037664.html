Subject: RE: Bearings

&gt;I have torn the engine down in my 70 bus to find the case cut to 
&gt;0.60and the thrustto 0.80. the crank is 0.20/0.20. There is a very 
&gt;slight catch on thecase when you run your fingernail across the 
&gt;bearing surface. My question what is the longevity of engines 
&gt;rebuilt with cases cut to0.80 and 0.80 thrust? I have located 
&gt;bearings for $46.00. Am I wasting money on line boring to 0.80 
&gt;and bearings? 

Last year I rebuilt a motor for my 58 single cab.  It was my first type1 motor 
ever (I'm more in to type IV's).  I spent over $1000 on new parts and an 
additional $350 on machining.  It wasn't until after I had had the machining 
done that I learned that the thrust was wallowed out so bad it had to be cut to 
.80 and the bearings were cut to .80 as well (I blame myself for not checking 
this early on).  At that point I was so disgusted with how much I had spent 
that I put it together anyway.  My expectation for this motor is about 10K 
miles when I expect it to go up in a dramatic burst of flames.  Then I'll build 
another one right.

So my advice to you is if you are planning on spending some money to build this 
engine right and want to get 50K+ miles out of it then you need a different 
case (either a new one or one that isn't already cut to the extreme).  If you 
want to slap it together and hope for the best then go right ahead, but I 
wouldn't throw more than a couple hundred bucks at it.
