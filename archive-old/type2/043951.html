Not an expert, but the engine goes up in at an angle. This allows enough
clearance (not much) to raise and start to level the engine out before
aligning it with tranny shaft.

&gt; Hi again -
&gt;
&gt; Yes, it's me, the guy w/the GEX engine (belay the reply, I've been
&gt; thoroughly forewarned).  As I've told a few people, I don't have the time
or
&gt; money to turn back now.  The reason?  Of a personal nature, so call me a
&gt; schmuck, but my circumstances dictate that I get moving now.  Essentially,
&gt; time is of the essence RIGHT NOW, &amp; I can always get more money (no, I
don't
&gt; particularly care to throw it away)  Maybe I can serve as a test (dummy?)
&gt; subject to check latest standards of GEX.
&gt;
&gt; Good Dr. Tim recommended checking the &quot;crankshaft endplay.&quot;  I have the
&gt; Hayes, &amp; think I have an idea of what you're referring to, Doc.  It sounds
&gt; like I'd have to break open the case to do this, yes?  Anything else I
might
&gt; be able to inspect, to give me a better feeling?
&gt;
&gt; So:  forging ahead, against the advice of many.  I have some more install
&gt; questions, and would be most appreciative of list member input.  A few
folks
&gt; said:  yes, put the cooling tins/engine compartment seal on before putting
&gt; back in.  OK - BUT, this sounds difficult.  What about the &quot;shaft&quot; that
goes
&gt; between the transmission &amp; the engine (don't know the common name/couldn't
&gt; seem to find in Hayes).  Is there any special way this should be installed
&gt; into the motor &amp; the tranny?  Will there be any problems w/this while
&gt; jacking the motor back into the compartment?  Any tricks y'all know of?
I'm
&gt; just thinking of how far we (my buddy &amp; I) had to back the motor out of
the
&gt; tranny (w/tin already removed) to get &quot;that shaft&quot; clear.  With the tin on
&gt; before installation, it doesn't seem like I'll have enough play to slide
it
&gt; in there, also considering the angle.
&gt;
&gt; If anyone knows of a website w/pics of the process or has pics they could
&gt; e-mail me, that would be most helpful.
&gt;
&gt; Tom &amp; Dana - thanks guys.  I think I might be able to get a few pics into
&gt; the &quot;digital medium.&quot;  I'd be most appreciative if you would take a look.
&gt; Plus, then I'll have some on file should I need them for a warranty
matter.
&gt; I guess I won't mess w/the EGR until I've taken the pics.  Where, exactly,
&gt; is the dime-sized thingy to indicate an overheated condition?
&gt;
&gt; A most apprehensive, but equally grateful,
&gt;
&gt; Mark
