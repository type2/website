Howdy,      Thinking a bit about Muir, Bentley, Haynes, and the like, I
just thought I'd add my thoughts and experiences...   I bought my 1st
car, a ' 69 *veedoubleyou* bug back in about ' 72 or so.  At the time I
knew not a heck of a lot about cars, engines, or life for that matter. 
One of my best friends allowed me to travel from Oregon to Mexico to
Connecticut in his bug, and I learned not much on that trip.....except
that there were a bunch of states I hadn't been to, and beer could be
bought at an earlier age the farther east we went. ;-)  Somewhere in
Kansas or so, my friend experienced a minor problem that was fixed with
something he carried in his tool box.  I was too busy staring at what
looked like an ocean, but on land.  I hitchhiked back to Oregon across
Canada after the excursion east, but that's another story.  
              When I got back home to Oregon, I went out and bought this
compleat idiot book to hopefully learn something about my bug.  I managed
to do tune-ups, oil changes, and exhaust replacement.  Muir got me
through those O.K.  His book gave me a feeling that I could actually get
myself greasy and accomplish something with my car that I loved.  Later I
realized that I just couldn't sleep comfortably in that bug, so I sold it
(wished I hadn't) and bought a spanking new *veedoubleyou* bus.  It's
been my companion through numerous trips around the Western U.S. and up
to Alaska, etc. and has never let me down, other than minor fixable
things while on the road.  Again I've consulted Muir's book, as well as
my Bentley manual that I bought back in 
' 78.  Unfortunately, or maybe fortunately, I've never pulled my own
engine.  I've left that for the professionals with all the high tech.
equipment.  I just have a basic set of tools to get me through the basic
maintenance procedures to keep it running smoothly.  I'd like to add
that...through reading the posts on this site, I've learned one heck of a
lot about darned near everything bus related, and now am gearing up to
take on more major projects with my bus.  My tool supply is increasing,
etc.  
         This all leads up to a question that I've wondered since I
started becoming bus-enlightened on this Type II site.............  When
and how did you all get started working on your own veedubs?   Was it
Muir?......helping a friend?......auto classes?
I can tell that there is a wealth of technical knowledge in all of you,
and I'm really glad that you're taking the time to share it with the
World, but I'd really like to know where and how this knowledge evolves
in other like-minded people such as yourselves.  Do you own
shops......teach classes.......tutor friends.....  
                TIA.........TGIF......HAGW (Have a Good Weekend)
