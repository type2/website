Subject: Re: [T2] 70 Trans - a bit wordy sorry

I spent far less for the used trans than a rebuilt,
&gt;however, I
&gt;only get a 30 day warranty.


Don't sweat the used tranny thing.  If the vehicle it came from wasn't 
abused, the used transaxle could last for years before needing a rebuild.  
If nothing else, it gotyou back on the road for awhile.  My junkyard '091 
has 10 years of nearly trouble-free useage on it.  Stiiill going!!!

	Eron
