&quot;The most important part is to change out the &quot;dryer&quot; and make sure that
you get all of the system &quot;vacuumed&quot; before recharging it.&quot;


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Would this be a new dryer of the same or change out with a different type of 
dryer? Is the one you are getting the &quot;rotary&quot; type or more like a NOS?

Also a bit off the path same topic:

My bus does not have a Belly Pan. Is this because of the Dryer?

Thanks,

Michael Knight
