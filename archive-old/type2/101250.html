&lt;&lt;  The tool you need here is an impact driver. Any good parts store, tool
truck, Sears, etc. It looks like a large &quot;Screw driver handle&quot;, with a 3/8
drive on it. Use a 6 point - 6mm socket on it. With your 6mm &quot;socket&quot; on the
drive, hold the handle with a twisting tension on the handle to the left or
off direction as you hit the end of the handle with a (BDH), the bolts should
brake loose and come right out! BTW, (BDH) = Big Damn Hammer!
    Good luck. &gt;&gt;

Clean the head on the bolt...Make sure there's no paint in the head of the
bolt. Heat it with a propane/Mapp torch and cool it with a shot of P B 
Blaster, before hitting it with the wrench.
