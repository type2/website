Sacramento, Ca:

1965 13-window deluxe, new paint, dual port (1600?), dual carbs (brand?)
almost all new rubber, great interior, lowered, bench seat, 12V, purple over
seafoam green.  $3500/offer                                        
Justin: 916 944 7015

Note:  I know this guy, and have seen the bus a lot.  it has a modified
camper interior, with the closet modified not to occlude the windows.  Its a
fairly nice bus, definitely of the cal-looker variety.  He's s'posed to be
getting me pix for me to put up on my web site in the next couple days.
