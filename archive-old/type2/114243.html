Subject: RE: [T2] Door buzzer idea

&gt;You could go back to the original wiring (which buzzes when the door is
&gt;open) and add a different buzzer for when the lights are on and the engine
&gt;is off.  See:

I purchased a buzzer that is wired into the fuse box from Wal-Mart that
tells me when I've left the lights on.  It is by 3M and cost about 7 dollars
US.  It took me about 5 minutes to put it in and I've yet to leave the
lights on.

Hope this helps,
