Subject: Re: [T2] Vacuum advance cutoff

Mine, while non-functional, is above the battery. 

How does that thing work? I read and re-read the Bentley and still
don't get it... How does the advance NOT work at certain gears? And
why?

&gt; The diagram in Bentley shows a temperature switch that enables the advance
&gt; in the lower three gears below 54F. I can only find the switch on the
&gt; transmission. Does anyone know where this temperature switch is located and
&gt; which 72-74 models have it?
