Subject: flat spot

hey everybody! well the kreeper has been running with its rebuilt motor
for a week or so now and is going pretty good..oh the subject? flat
spot? oh that! 1600 dual port. 009 new bocar 34 pict-3. 1st gear winds
up just fine. 2nd through 4th is different. past what i would guess to
be 1800-2000 rpms goes pretty good also. if i am on a flat and just
barely feather the throttle through the aforementioned zone, it goes
alright. timing is set at 30 total advance, think idle is like 7-10
degress or something like that. the accelerator (sp) pump is adjusted
full rich at the time being. the owner of the shop i got the engine from
said to drill the pump nozzle out a bit and that should take care of
it....question is has anyone done this? is it fairly easy? has anyone
had bad experiences with this? has anyone changed out the idle jet? I
also have the funny feeling i am getting really bad gas mileage. engine
has 200 miles on it so far and i think it is like 14 mpg?  am going to
fill up tomorrow and should have a better idea next week. i drive pretty
much only around town. thanks in advance!
