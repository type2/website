OK, disclaimers out the wazoo here, as gas leaks scare me.

Two options right now come to mind.
1) Unscrew the fire wall tin, pull it out, and have a look see to see 
what's wrong.  You shouldn't be leaking gas, naturally, but if it's 
&quot;just&quot; a leaking fill pipe things aren't too serious.  Personally, I'd go 
this route, as I'd like to know.  If it is indeed a leaky fill pipe, I'd 
do option 2.

2) You may want to say to heck with it and cut to this one right away.  
Will probably address the symptoms, even if you don't have a clue as to 
the cause.  Buy a jerry can from the gas station--a 6 gallon if they have 
it.  Get under the car and unclamp the fuel line (crimp it with 
vise-grips first), and fill the jerry with the gas in your tank.  
Re-attach fuel line.  Undo vise-grips.  Now the level of gas in the main 
tank should be low enough that you won't notice the problem.

But PLEASE keep an eagle eye on the problem!  You are absolutely sure the 
leak is NOT is the engine compartment, right?  If it is, fix it--don't 
drive the bus until you replace the offending line (if it is an engine 
compartment leak).

Let us now how it works out.
