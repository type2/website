&gt;I may be wrong but if I remember correctly the vacuum part of the

&gt;When the throttle is snapped closed, you have a high vacuum, which pulls
&gt;on the diaphragm in the pressure regulator and opens the fuel return
&gt;line wider.  This lowers the fuel pressure and by doing that reduces HC
&gt;emissions on engine deceleration when there is no load and lots of fuel
&gt;is not needed.

Sean,

The Haynes manual states that the pressure regulator varies pressure from
(nominally) 29 to 34 PSI. The pressure changes smoothly over the entire
vacuum range of the engine. (Try putting a pressure gauge one of the fuel
rails and you will see this). I don't see any reason why this would not
adjust the mixture to the engine dependant on vacuum (load).

I have never seen in print the actual reason for the vacuum adjustment of
the fuel pressure. It is interesting to note that my Saturn has the exact
same setup with a pressure regulator that adusts pressure based on engine
vacuum.
