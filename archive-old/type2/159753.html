Subject: Re: [T2] Electronic Ignition Woes

&gt; Yeah. I've done Pertronix before.
&gt; 
&gt; The only possible issue is this:
&gt; 
&gt; http://www.youtube_dot_com/watch?v=vhgbVnLcBFM
&gt; 
&gt; That spike happens on my dash gauge too. I think that spike is from
&gt; the points though.

Have you tried putting the pertronix on there to see what happens?  And 
that spike is coming from when you had the points installed?

If I were seeing that, I would probably change out all of my spark plug 
wires (esp if they seemed kinda used), clean all the connections 
thoroughly, maybe even change out the rotor and cap and also put in new 
points.  Once you get things to a known good point, then go ahead and 
try the HS again.  I use the MegaSquirt as my tach and while it may 
wander up and down, it doesn't spike like that.
