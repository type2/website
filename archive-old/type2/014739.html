Subject: Cool Wheels for your 71-91 Bus or Vanagon

X-Diagnostic: MESSAGE MAY NOT BE TOPICAL

I was looking around at the site listed by another listee and ran across
these real cool looking wheels. They look like the old Empi 5 Spoke, but are
made for the Bus/Vanagons. They are 5 on 112mm and listed as a replacement
Bus wheel. I do not know the US price on these, but I am sure its not cheap.
They come in Chrome and silver. Below is the link to the page. This could be
a way to put 71-79 Brakes on your pre 71 and still maintain that &quot;vintage&quot;
look.
