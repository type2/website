Subject: Re: [T2] 1970 westy~sliding door inside handle

[...]

Well, d'oh! on my part. I didn't even see '1970 westy' in the subject line
until I hit send.
OK, then you need the double-ended handle.
Like I said in my 1st reply, it is pretty much unobtainable now. Very rare to
show up on ebarf.
The double-end made it slightly easier to open the door with the sink unit in
place. If you don't have the sink unit, you can use the standard handle.... as
pictured in the ebarf link I sent earlier.
Only the later Westies got the rear helper handle as pictured in the link. I
only sent that link to help you identify your handle. As I said earlier, the
standard handle is the same as the one pictured. The only difference is the
bracket that mounts on the door. LIKE I SAID AT THE BOTTOM OF MY MESSAGE!

BTW, they don't normally show cracks on the outside. But if you remove the
handle and look on the back side around the metal insert, that is where the
cracks appear and weaken the handle.

&gt; this handle isnt even on my bus... i never even saw the bolts for it back
&gt; there til my curiosity got the better of me and i just HAD to go look.
&gt; there are 2 bolts but no rear handle. on mine, if you lift the handle up
&gt; it pulls the back end of the door in and latches. down releases it, up
&gt; pulls it in. perhaps that is why i don't have that handle. you said the
&gt; rear one looks just like the front one... mine doesnt look like that at
&gt; all. thanks, though.
&gt;
&gt; thanks, but the one i need is the &quot;T shaped&quot; front handle... if i had
&gt; known about the rear one, i would have specified. besides, he was trying
&gt; to close the door from the inside, not open it. if i had a digicam i
&gt; would take a pic of it.
&gt;
&gt; and about the plastic being brittle with time... it had no cracks in it
&gt; like the steering wheel does so i did not feel that was part of the
&gt; problem. i tried to get that feeling across by saying &quot;i feel it would
&gt; have lasted me a while&quot;, but i guess i didnt. no, i do not believe it
&gt; would have snapped if he hadn't jerked it the way he did. as a matter of
&gt; fact, just a day or so earlier, i felt the whole bus jolt when he YANKED
&gt; it that time, too. and i remember thinking to myself... &quot;JEEZ! ya dont
&gt; have to be so rough with it...&quot; but he is so sensitive to my criticism
&gt; that i didnt want to make him feel like i was &quot;yelling&quot; at him. now i
&gt; wish i had. he is always telling me i dont have to slam the door on his
&gt; NEON... i dont think i am really slamming it... but i definitely felt the
&gt; whole bus violently jolt when he yanked that handle the other day. i even
&gt; felt the force of the yank that broke the handle...
&gt;
&gt; anyway, thanks for your help and i hope to find one soon,
&gt; chris

&gt; &gt; Is your bus a Westy or a bus?
&gt; &gt; The Westy uses a double-ended handle that is now unobtanium.
&gt; &gt; The bus uses a single handle.
&gt; &gt; Here is a bus handle on ebarf:
&gt; &gt; http://cgi.ebay_dot_com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&amp;item=1755617103
&gt; &gt; This one has the extra bracket to mount it on the back edge. But the
&gt; &gt; handle
&gt; &gt; itself is the same as the front one.
&gt; &gt; If this is the one you need, I have extra good used ones.....
