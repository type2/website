Subject: [T2] Type 4 tin assembly :-o
&gt;
&gt; My question today:  I'm battling another time-waster, I can't find any
&gt; references for the type of tin fitted to my engine in Bentley or Haynes
{:-0
&gt; I should have made a diagram during disassembly!  The illustrations shown
&gt; don't appear to be type 4 pancake style motor tin like that fitted to mine
&gt; and I've searched the T2 library, archives and the net too.  Is there
&gt; anywhere where I can see a diagram showing how to put this stuff back
&gt; together...I never was good with puzzles!  Even good pictures of an
&gt; assembled engine with tin in place would help (especially the side-views,
&gt; area by the alternator and bottom view).  On the plus side my tin looks
good
&gt; with fresh low gloss paint and Hoover bulkhead fittings...but it would
look
&gt; better on the engine!
