&gt; I've seen alot of comments on this thread having to do with Bentley's and
&gt; other manuals that contain wiring schematics, and I felt I would add my own
&gt; (penny-saving) experience. While looking for a good color-coded wiring
&gt; diagram for my '78 Bus, I decided to visit the library to see if they had
&gt; anything. Well, it turns out they did! I found full two-page wiring
&gt; schematics that are black and white, but are labelled with the colors, fully
&gt; detailed and easy to read. Those diagrams have been indispensable ever
&gt; since, and they only cost $1.50!


you found these wiring diagrams for the 78????  I have seen em for earlier
busses but for the later ones all I have found is that stupid flow chart
like wiring diagram.

what/where did you find this holy grail???
