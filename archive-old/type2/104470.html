Subject: Re: [T2] Lack of Confidence in Van

&gt; least you can bring your van home. Travelled 2000miles this way, had very
&gt; bad gas-mileage and learnt to push the brake, clutch and gas all with two
&gt; feet...

Heel-toe braking! Woo-hoo! This is very good training if you ever get into
autocross with a rear-engine car like a beetle, ghia, or Porsche 911!

My Weber Progressive has my foot trained very well. When the weather sucks,
need to keep the revs up so the engine won't die and lose vacuum to the brake
booster. In the bus, I use my heel on the brake (so I can stomp the peddle
if/when the engine dies). In my old 911, I used my heel on the gas and toe on
the brake - but I would probably adjust the pedals to make it easier to do it
the other way around if I had to do it over again.

BTW, I ordered a Sprint DFV air filter assembly from Peirce Manifolds. I'm
going to make a heat riser for the Weber Progressive as soon as it arrives.
I'll be sure to detail the process and note the results!

-Eric
