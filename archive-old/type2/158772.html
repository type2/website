Subject: Re: [T2] 1600 DP engine (new) with bad #2 cylinder

Hello Chris    I know you don't want to hear this but I had  one of those 
tubes pinch the piston so that the ring was pinched before. Might  not be your 
problem. Try a new plug and open the gap to .030 also try spraying  some water 
into the carb as it is running. Don't get too carried away doing this  but it 
will clean all the carbon out. Also try tapping on the exhust and intake  
rockers while it is running as it might be that there is still some of the tube  
left stuck in the valve opening. You can have a pinched ring and still have good 
 compression . It is also possible that the NEW plug isn't any good, be there 
 ,won a shirt :)  later  mark Dearing
