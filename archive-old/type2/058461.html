Hi-
Reckon you are lucky !!--- Have you used the right hose and clips - the clips
are also important, --- not the Jubilee type cos they can pintch the line and
lead to leaks. The clips which are screw type have a protective plate to stop
the clip getting caught up in the hose. I'd sort it fast !!!

&gt;Eventually cured it with some tape under the clamp to give it more to work
on, and also wired it in as well, but you nearly had one less camper (and
driver) in your ranks.
