Subject: Fibreglass Spoilers &amp; bumpers

A while ago there was a thread about spoilers for the front of vans. Well I have
had one on Ashley for over a year and it seems to make a difference to his
stability in cross winds. At Vanfest I picked up a card from the man who
supplied me with the spoiler. He also does replacement bumpers in fibreglass.
Contact details are-

P E Barton
Telephone: Chesterfield (UK) - (0246) 236489 - I think you add 44 to call from
outside the UK
No address supplied on the card.

He also does a range of spare bits including hinges and plugs for sinks ! (I
know it's not a big bit but if you haven't got one you'll miss it). Also New &amp;
used caravettes.

Price for the spoiler was 35 UKP and it has withstood severl big whacks from
road humps, kerbs etc so the quality is good. Colour is black but I think white
is available. The bumpers also look very good but mine are OK at the moment so I
havn't tried them.

Hope this helps someone.
