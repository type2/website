Pete,

Look in the shifter housing on the floor.  There should be a little switch
that the shifter lever pushes against when in reverse.  There are probably
other switches that indicate when the shifteris in neutral and park, so
you don't hit the starter  when in drive.  I don't know about VW autos
specifically, but I have had other cars with automatics and they all had
switches in them, so I'm sure your bus isn't any different.

Craig
