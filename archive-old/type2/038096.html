My first suggestion would be getting a Bentley Manual for the Westy.  The 
Bentley manuals have really great color wiring diagrams which make a
Haynes manual look like child's play.  The cost isn't too bad either, only 
about $35 US.  I know the manual has been a great resource for me as I 
have been renovating my 1970 235 Kombi.

Subject: 71 westy help needed


&gt;As I continue to slug along rehabbing my 71 Westy, i am about to
&gt;consider putting it on the road as a daily driver. Here's the problem:
&gt;
&gt;PO had some electrical issues and it has a loom of wires hanging under
&gt;the dash. No evidence of any burns or other ugly but I need to know the
&gt;pattern of what goes where. Headlight switch is intact, but hanging and
&gt;if pulled, parking lights work but no headlights. Ignition switch is
&gt;bypassed and has a handy push button switch in the engine comp. (how
&gt;novel) BUT it starts and runs so nicely...
&gt;
&gt;Sooooo, what I'm looking for is some direction as to where i can find a
&gt;correct layout for what goes where and i can rewire this puppy... No
&gt;fear here as it has maybe 20 wires and my Alfa 164 has about 20 miles of
&gt;wire! 
&gt;
&gt;20 wires is a snap... famous last words.
&gt;
&gt;Pointers? ideas? 
&gt;
&gt;All help appreciated.
