Right, they most certainly don't.
The point thst I was tying to make was the incopatabiity of the
oils--that all.

However you look at it I think it isn't a safe bet to be mixing them,
even though the oil has been dropped out of the engine, there is still
some left in there, and this makes me feel real uncomfortable.

I know the synthetic stuff is best for every and all driving
conditions--no doubt in my mind.

But I would feel a lot better about it if it was from new, or at rebuild
time to start with the conversion.

Another thought is--a strick maintenence schedule is a good thing for
engine longevity using the correct oil----and my Bus doesn't count yet,
because it only has 32,000 miles on it.

But in retrospect, my 85 GL has 188,000 on it, and my 86 325 BMW has
229,000 on it and both neither leak, smoke, or consume any petriolium
products between oil changes, and run excellent using Castrol GTX 20 /50

Ahh--and here's a twist--- I use MMO in both of them at oil change
time---The Beemer since new, the GL for 88,000 miles, the 74 Westfalia
for 6000 miles.

Later
