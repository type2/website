Subject: Has anyone ever...

Hey All,
Has anyone ever tried to put a bay window camper pop top on a Vanagon?  I have a vanagon with a leaky sunroof, and I really want a camper anyway, so this seem like a good idea to me.  Anyone know if sizes are comparable or if it will be at least &quot;close enough&quot;?



Peace, John Baker
