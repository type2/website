Subject: Tranny Fluid

Once again I'd like to thank everyone who has helped me out with
suggestions for things to do to my bus!  It's helped a lot.

My next question is about tranny fluid.  It's to my undertstanding that
the fill for the tranny is somewhere near the left front axle and the
drain is in the rear.  Is that correct??  And is there anything I should
know, before I go ahead and do this?

One more thing.  If everything is going good, like I have a blue spark
from my coil, good spark from the plugs and there in good shape, new
spark plug wires, new fuel filter, fuel lines are in good shape, new
rotor, points and condenser, new carb....how could the bus still be
losing power??  Just driving along and all of a sudden it shakes a
couple times and no power??

Thanks

Jeff
