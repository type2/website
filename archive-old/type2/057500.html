Subject: carb question

Fellow listees,

I have been having some problems with my 74 1800 as far as low power and
excessive fuel consumption.  I am going through the Bently manual and
carefully following the procedures for adjusting and balancing the carbs (I
am running stock dual solex 34 PDSIT-2/3).  I came across the part about
adjusting the dashpot and discovered that I do not appear to have one.
Question 1 is; what does the dashpot do for the carburation system?
Question 2 is; would this cause the low power &amp; excessive fuel consumption
problem?  A little history:  I have a new AVP engine with approximately
1100 miles on it and have rebuilt the carbs.  If anyone out there has any
ideas on these problems, please enlighten me.

TIA
