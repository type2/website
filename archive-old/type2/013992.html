Subject: Re: [T2] Replace pilot bearing or not?

Alan,

I would replace it.  The methods described in the archives are generally
for removal of the remains of chewed-up ones.  If your old one has not
disintegrated, it has also not welded itself to the end of the crank and
it will be *much* easier to remove (ask me how I know :-)

My favorite removal method is to get a drift that is the correct diameter
[1] (I am remembering 12mm, but I can't remember why... check it with a
mike!!!) pack the end of the crank with grease, insert the drift just past
the start of the rollers (*very* important!  do not whack the ends of the
rollers or you will drive the bearing in and ruin it at the same time!)
then whack it with a hammer... lightly.  the hydraulic pressure of the
grease on the inner end of the bearing will drive it out very peacefully.
Wear eye protection against flying grease. If you use this hydraulic
removal method, the old bearing is quite reusable, so save it in your
spares box.

My reasoning in replacing is that this area is a PITA to get to and I hate
the thought of expending so much effort twice.  Take no chances!  Replace
everything!  Look closely at the clutch disk, pressure plate, and throwout
bearing as well.  I know you probably have these on hand as well, but
wouldn't it be hell to put all of them in, button up your fresh rebuild,
head out and have to pull the engine in 6 months for a failed bearing?
99% chance it won't happen, but you are betting two full days of labor
against a $3.95 bearing that it won't.  To me the risk isn't worth the
reward, especially as you have the bearing on hand.

[1] A bolt with the threaded end cut off and the sharp edge rounded off
with a file makes a fine drift here, BTW
