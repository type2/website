Subject: Re: gasoline vapor induction?

&gt;   I know that I am probably going to destroy a couple of lawnmowers playing
&gt;with the idea though :-)

Totally off topic, but when I was in high school I was on a team that built 
a lawnmower that ran on powdered coal. It used gasoline to start, then, 
once running, we shut off the gas and fed it coal we had powdered in a ball 
mill to about the consistency of powdered sugar. We used a hopper with 
adjustable opening to feed it the coal. The mower vibrated just enough to 
keep the powder running. It ran great for many hours. But, finally the 
rings coked up and stopped sealing and the blowby became so bad that we 
could have used the crankcase vent as an air compressor.

All good fun! Seeing as 90% of the mowers on the curb are there because of 
bad carbs, they are idea test platforms for carb design.
