Subject: Wanted Clean 76 or later Passenger Bus in MD/DC/VA area

A good friend of mine is looking for a decent bus. He wants a 76-79 passenger bus with stock type IV 2.0 FI manual trans. No major body work needed. A little surface rust is okay but nothing that needs a complete paint job. No Frankenstein wiring jobs or car tires.Clean body is most important factor though. He would like to spend between $2500 and $3500. We will travel out of state but prefer MD/DC/VA area. Please reply to me at either this address or tresheti_at_provbank_dot_com. 
 
Best Regards,
