Subject: Re: [T2] Paper gasket alternate for FI intake at heads

&gt; Hello, I am putting the 2.0l FI back together, but the paper gaskets for
&gt; either side of the phenolic block at the head intakes are missing from
&gt; the gasket kit.

&gt; Is it advisable to use one of those as an alternate or should I hunt
&gt; down the gaskets?  Thx,

In that location I would prefer to put gaskets.  If you can't find them
easily you can just get some thick gasket paper at your local FLAPS and
cut your own.  Just trace the holes from the phenolic block and cut out
with scissors.
