&gt;   As some of you may recall, a while back I posted the &quot;crank, Spit, Nada&quot;
&gt; plea for advice. I received many kind and insightful suggestions, and since,
&lt;snip&gt;
 The timing light
&gt; came on and if this test was done right this means the condensor's shot, which
&gt; we will replace, along with the points, after I ask you this: do we remove the
&gt; whole dist. to do the job? Muir makes it sound so, 
&lt;snip&gt;

Rachel:
Whoa-when your car won't start (if it's not out of gas), there's a
65-75% chance it doesn't have spark. When it doesn't have spark, there's
similar odds that it's the points.
Points wear out and the gap changes, causing poor spark and timing
changes, but they also get oxidation deposits on them and conduct very
poorly, which means NO SPARK! Old timers would file points and in a
pinch one can even file them with a strip of fine sandpaper (wetordry
120 grit works best) or the abrasive strip from a matchbook cover.
In your case, hovever, GET NEW POINTS, Bosch, from your friendly local
VW parts place.
DON'T take out your distributor.
DON'T move your distributor.
I know it's hard to work on these with your head under the hood. My best
advice here is to get a strap-on-the-head flashlight. Nobody else can
shine that light where you want to see. You really need 3 hands.
The Muir book is out of date in regard to the #1 cyl. mark on the
distributor. Since 71 or so, the #1 cyl. mark is about at 1:30 o'clock
if the front-most part of the distributor is at 12:00 o'clock, so your
distributor is probably in right!
The distributor does 2 things:
1. It's a timer- it opens and closes the points 4 times in 2 revolutions
of the engine. It needs to do this very precisely to run well. It can
only be 10-15 crank degrees off from perfect to run AT ALL. That's 5-7.5
distributor degrees. Keep in mind that the spark happens when the points
OPEN.
2. It's a distributor- it takes the spark from the coil and thru the
center post of the cap, thru the rotor, sends it thru the outer posts of
the cap to the appropriate cylinder. There's NO tolerance for error
here!
I think at this point you may have 2 problems:
1. Points not functioning-no spark. To determine this pull the wire out
of the center of the cap, hold it near the bolt that holds the coil
bracket to the fan housing with about a 1/4&quot; gap. Take your other hand
away from the vehicle (you could get bit if the coil wire insulation is
not good- the electricity will take the shortest path to complete the
circuit, if that means through the insulation, your right hand, your
body, your left hand, to the engine lid, YOW! You'll know it.) Now have
your helper crank the engine over. You should see a big fat blue spark
going: snap, snap, snap, etc. Slowly increase the gap: you should get a
spark at least 1/2&quot; long before you lose it.
2. If you have a spark there, I assume the wires are in the wrong place.
(This is why all conscientious VW mechanics put the distrbutor drive in
the RIGHT position) 
Mail back if you get this far and it still won't start!
