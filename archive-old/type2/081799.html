Subject: Re: [T2] RE: Type 2 Front Seat Replacement?

I also have a '78 Deluxe and found a junked out '84 Vanagon a couple of
weeks ago at the local junk yard. While scavaging for stuff I noticed how
comfortable the seats were compared to my original bus seats(and they're in
excellent condition). Is it really as simple as it sounds to install them?
When I brought my bus home a month or so ago it took me about a week to get
my back in shape after a 2100 mile trip. My original seats have been redone
and look like new and I'm concerned about keeping it stock for looks or
replacing them for comfort?

&gt; &gt; Just before I drove back to Everybus I installed a 1986 Vanagon drivers
seat
&gt; &gt; with both armrests into Roadcow. I feel it was the best thing I've ever
done
&gt; &gt; to a bus! All I had to do was to pound down the &quot;inner&quot; seat rails on my
bus
&gt;
&gt; I did this to my 78 a couple years ago, and I have to agree it is the best
&gt; single thing I did for comfort in my bus,  since mine is a deluxe I had
&gt; the air duct on the door but I just removed the door side armrest,  since
&gt; it was a later bus it just slid right in.  anyone who hasn't really should
&gt; at least give it a try
