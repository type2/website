You have had to make a similar decision as I did over the engine in our bus
(running hot _at_ 50mph+) I wanted some more grunt to get up hills so I lumped
for a 1776cc, however that's well in excess of £1000 from most people. Or I
could build a new engine myself, I don't now about our friends across the
pond but we have the expression &quot;You pay your money, you makes your choice&quot;.

As to the cost of £700 - £800 that is VERY high! What is the bottom end
like? Crank etc...? £700 buys a NEW engine from Heritage etc. I think you
are right &amp; your first mechanic is charging you a &quot;Plonker penalty&quot;! I would
be very interested in where you purchased this &quot;crap&quot; engine from (off list)
As I'm buying parts for my new lump.

As I see it you have several options:-

1.
Buy a new engine from Just Kampers on 0% finance over 6 months &amp; spend
another £200-ish on fitting, good reliable van, no worries blah blah blah.

2.
Just replace the rings on the barrel _at_ fault, but make sure you make friends
with the engine &amp; a BIG tub of hand cleaner, coz you'll be seeing both
again! But _at_ least you can save over winter &amp; get a new lump in the spring
(VEGA £790+VAT).

3.
Find a good lump to replace yours second-hand (grab pulley &amp; push-pull hard,
should be no play).

I wonder where you are located? If you are near London I have a 1600 that
I'm pulling apart for the case (read my bug case woes 2 weeks ago &quot;I think
I'm in DEEP DO-DO!&quot;). Now I only REALLY want the case &amp; will be tossing the
heads etc in the parts/trash can, I might well find that this engine has
barrels etc that could get you out of the DO-DO your in, give me a call if
your near enough. (I have sent my No. direct to you)

BTW
As to your heads being only 2 years old, talk to a drag racer he'll wet him
self laughing! It's not how old they are it's what abuse they have suffered.
