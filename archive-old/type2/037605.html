Subject: muffler installation

Well, since my post of Saturday evening disappeared into the ozone, I
just wanted to share with everybody that last weekend I replaced my
muffler, heat shield, engine seal, and repainted the three rear pieces
of engine tin on my 1973 1700cc. I did it all by my little lonesome, but
y'all were there in spirit -- I never would've tackled these
progressively more difficult tasks without the &quot;you can do it, and do it
yourself&quot; attitude of The List.

Tomorrow I'm taking the day off to help a friend get acquainted with his
newly-purchased 1970 Bug, and I'm going to re-do my muffler so I can
bang out a little clearance for my oil filler tube.

This is a long way from my terrified first valve adjustment last October
in the middle of west Texas! :-)
