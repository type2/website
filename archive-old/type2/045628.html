Subject: [T2] Dizzy rebuild kits?

After doing a quick scan of the archives looking for info on rebuilding
ditributors, I came to the conclusion that I needed a rebuild kit with the
appropriate washers, shims and small plastic parts which disintegrated upon
disassembly.  I would have been happy just cleaning and lubing had I not
realized that end play was important (praise be to the archives!)  So, off I
went to my FLAPS and they had no clue where I could find a dizzy rebuild
kit.  Any suggestions on where I should look?  They did have a line on an
already rebuilt dizzy for $56 + core which I ordered, and am hoping it is
the right one for that price, but I'm still looking for a kit to get my
original back into shape to have for spare.

Oh yeah, this is a single vacuum distributor off of a '76 2.0L.

Thanks all,
Niall
