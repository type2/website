&gt;  I want to put the VDO 3 guage under dash console in.  My shift knob will hit

&gt; I've fooled around with various plumbing fixtures to make some kind of wacky 
&gt; extension, but I just can't get it right.  Anyone know a source for some kind 
&gt; of metric threaded rod, 90's or couplers?  I've also heard of a bolt -on, but 
&gt; don't know where to get one that is '71 bus friendly.  I couldn't find 
&gt; anything in archives either.  Also, does anyone know if a little Sunpro tach 
&gt; will fit the VDO rubber console?  

on the shift extension:
i plan on making my own if i need one.  All you need to do is get a piece
of steel rod... figure out how to drill a centered hole in the end...
thread it.  Tap the top for a shift knob. then screw it on your shift rod
and figure out which way and how much you want to bend it. mark it with a
magic marker.  Put it in a vise, heat it up and bend it to suit.  Tap the
top for a shift knob. Paint it black and yer done.  This would be simple 
if one had a lathe.  You could probably take steel rod to a machinist and
have him thread both ends for you and then take it home and bend it
yourself.  If enough people wanted shifter extensions i would even go into
business makin em...  Just enough people so i could afford a cheap
lathe???  Or i could go the machinist route, have the bars threaded and
bend&amp; paint em meself...  anyone interested drop me a p-mail... i'd
determine price based on how many are interested and what a machinist
would charge or if i buy a lathe etc.

on the tach:
JC Whitney baby... check their gague section, they have 2 1/8 tachs that
will fit in the VDO console perfectly... designed for it.  the sunpro at
autozone wouldnt fit without modifications, if at all... and the JC whipme
ones are _approximately_ the same price.

peas,

Steve
