&gt; I think I have finally found a bus. It is a 71 bus no motor. Rust
free has a
&gt; couple dents at bottom of nose. They guy who has it now says it had
an hi-
&gt; performance motor. I don't know what kind was in it. He said it had
an IRS
&gt; transaxle. Is this going to make it hard to find a motor?Is this a
plus? How
&gt; can I tell what kind of transaxle is in it? Any help would be greatly
&gt; appreciated.

IRS is a plus, but the transmission has to be supported if the engine
is out of the bus.  You can put a common 1600DP engine in the bus as
long as it has the rear mount bosses cast into the case.  

When dealing with the seller, you should try to get the rear engine
mount bar (&quot;Moustache Bar&quot;) and as much of the engine tin as possible.
 The front tin (that goes against the firewall seal) is a
one-year-only part.  The rest of the tin can be found, but it is a lot
easier if you can get the seller to cough it up!

Many consider the '71 to be a particularly good year (in the US),
since it had the combination of the 1600DP upright engine and power
disk front brakes.
