&gt; One day
&gt; I'm going to figure out how to install
&gt; auto-adjusting drums on the rear.

The drums are not self-adjusting.....
It is in the backing plate, shoes, and brake hardware.

All you need are the brake assembly and backing plates
from an 80 and up Vanagon. I plan on doing this
someday soon on my 77 Westy, but I am waiting for the
rear shoes to require replacement 1st....
I will let everyone know how it works out.
