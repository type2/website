Dat shabby clothes guy said:

&gt;People plug them up because the diaphragms rupture and new units are almost unheard of.

Ron's got some at Bus Depot, under $200.  Just noticed in the catalog last night.

Does anyone sell the check valve?  I get hits on &quot;check valve&quot; at busdepot but not sure if it's the one.

I have a small vac takeoff on the side of the manifold on my 1600 &gt;SP&lt; in my 71 - not the same diameter as the &quot;right&quot; one -- think it'll work?  I'd guess the only 
drawback would be less recovery capability when braking again and again?

Then Randy Rue'd:

&gt;I drove
&gt;mine without boost to the brakes for a little while and hard stops made my
&gt;knees pop (that's knees, plural, as I sometimes had to stomp that pedal with
&gt;both feet).

I must be strong like bull, or just used to driving non-servo Buses -- or Randy's got the old-man-knee-thing.  Mine's not that big a deal to brake, so I guess I'd have 
pinky-toe-operable brakes if I get my servo working.

Get yer ser-vo working....that's in a Doors tune, right?
