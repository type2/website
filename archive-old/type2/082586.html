Subject: Re: [T2] racing buses on dirt

It's been done, at least one baywindow has run the Baja 1000.

However, buses are getting old enough that they are a bit too valuable to
hack.  You'd get a lot of component failures.  The weight distribution of
a bus isn't as good as a bug for serious off-roading.

&gt; hello all,
&gt;
&gt; just something i was thinking about.
&gt;
&gt; i think it would be cool, and i'm very interested in
&gt; trying to do it. no campers, of course, that would
&gt; just be foolish (I think). i'm thinkin i would
&gt; probably just get a regular bay, strip down the
&gt; interior. install two roll bars. one right behind the
&gt; front seats, and one in the rear, where the bench seat
&gt; used to be. probably some sway bars too, and decent
&gt; tires. which BTW does anyone know of a link for some
&gt; decent dirt racing tires?
&gt;
&gt; i think that if it got big enough you would want to
&gt; have it divided into classes of Type 1 &amp; Type 4
&gt; engines. maybe racers could even hook sponsors,
&gt; someday.
&gt;
&gt; just a thought, but one i would like to pursue. any
&gt; thoughts or insights would be greatly appreciated.
&gt; does this even remotely interest anyone else? even
&gt; just as a spectator? does this sort of thing go on
&gt; presently? if so where?
&gt;
&gt; ok thats it for now, thanks in advance for any replys.
