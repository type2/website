Ah, beg to differ here, but I think you have it backwards here.
Optically-triggered systems are fine unless the light source gets dusty,
dirty, oily or grimy - then the beam of light is affected negatively.
Hall-effect magnetic systems, on the other hand, are not affected by dust,
dirt, oil, grime and moisture.

  Ah, but it is NOT a &quot;Hall&quot; Ignition System.  Allison/Crane XR700 units have
been an infared-opto-trigger beam style for the past 30+ years.  The beam is
broken by the slots in the rotor disc installed on the distributor shaft just
below the ignition rotor.  The nice thing about the opto-trigger beam is that
dust/dirt does not usually affect it, unlike cheeper Hall &quot;magnetic&quot; style
ignitions.

  But it is still classified as an Electronic Ignition System.

    Roy, I use the Crane 700 system and it has a large electronic box with a
    heatsink on it. What kind of ignition is this classified as?? Seems like a
    lot of electronics for a Halls system?? Why bother with it rather than
just
    use your 39 dollar system??
