Subject: Early master cylinders
To: type2_at_type2_dot_com

 I saw a metal spacer for use on a 67 master cylinder
so that you could put in a late model master on the 67
avoding the $200 67 master.
 Would I be able to use this same setup on my 68 and
70 to avoid the expensive early bay master?
Thanks-----Bryan
