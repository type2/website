     With all the talk about trailers last week, I decided to post some pics 
of my Harbor Freight utility trailer on my page. I also updated my progress 
page on the axle beam replacement (click on the rotted beam at the bottom of 
page 1). One thing I forgot to mention, if any one is interested, maximum 
weight on this trailer is 1000 lbs. It is very lightweight, I have no trouble 
moving it around by myself. Anyway. here's the link &lt;A
