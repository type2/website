I have two 71 bugs in various states of dis repair, one is mostly complete with
need of a few repaiers that can be taken form the other, the other is basicly a
striped down to a good pan, due to local politics they now say I can no longer
keep them in my drive and work on them at my leasure. so they need to be
removed and I would ratehr than give them to a junk yard, or a scrap metal
dealer I would rather give them to soem one in the area that would be
willinling to finish some of the work on them that I have started.

if your interested and can arange to transport them please contact me directly.
and we will work out soem sort of arangement.


Dave
