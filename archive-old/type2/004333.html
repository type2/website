Subject: looking for Overheating site

I am at my wits end.
There used to be a site that I bookmarked:
http://www.simplecom_dot_net/dakhlia/bus-stuff/overheating.html
But it is no longer up. Anybody know where it went? I really need to rethink
the whole thing and I thought this was a good place to start.

At &quot;Busses by the River&quot; this weekend, we adjusted the carb and timing,
(thanks Mark!!) but still too hot on the way home, and very poor power.
-( I cannot enjoy the ride any longer, and that is very sad.
