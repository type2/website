&gt; &gt; &gt; There are supposed to be one-way flapper valves on the fan shroud
assembly
&gt;
&gt; I happened to find some of these at a junkyard and H. Steve photo'd 'em
&gt; for us! I imagine another reason they're so scarce is that those little
&gt; hinge pins just fall out eventually from engine vibration. I figure when
&gt; I put these on my fan shroud I'll peen the ends over or something like
that.

You shouldn't have to.....the covers in your 2nd pic hold the pins in.

&gt; These are the small plates that screw on where the heater boxes meet the
shroud:

There are 2 sets of flaps. These and the pair IN the ends of the electric
blower fan.

The lower 2 are there to keep the heat from a gas heater from blowing out
the engine fan
opening when you have the engine off and the gas heater on. This will allow
all the heated
air to go forward.
They also stop the air flow from going out the engine fan opening if you
have the engine off,
key on, and the blower fan on. Why you would do this, I don't have a clue:)

The upper 2 are there to keep the air from the engine fan from going out the
electric blower
fan above idle. At idle, the electic fan moves more air thru the heater
boxes than the engine fan does.
