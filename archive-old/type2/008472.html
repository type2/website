 Hi,
	This is a FAQ. Muir says Warmitup, VW says don't (unless it's
really cold). IMHO the list concensus is to go with VW, but I may be
putting my own interpretation on the posts I've seen.
 There are devices for precirculating oil available (though not for
the VW bus AFAIK: more for big engines (diesel?) than small.

 Personally I don't think there's a conspiracy between the car makers
and the oil companies but then, that's what they want me to think...
 I'm more worried about the conspiracy between government and car makers
to get &quot;older&quot; vehicles off the roads in favour of using lots of precious
resources building nice shiny new ones that use less fuel but which are
engineered to last only ten years.

Cheers,
	W.
