Subject: RE: [T2] 73 air injection

Stew,

Here is the skinny. The thread is a 10X1.0. You want to get a bolt and cut
off the head and cut a slot in the top so you can use a flat head screw
driver to thread it in. Use some red lock tight and screw it in, then use
some JB weld on the top to seal it off. You should try to count the thread
in the head and cut your stud that length. This is about 10 to 15 threads,
usually. The major concerns are first not to disrupt the air flow and second
the valve. The valve is about 1 1/2 to 2 inches down.

Subject: [T2] 73 air injection


Does anyone know what size thread and length could be put into the air
injection port on the 1700 heads. I built this engine from peices and did
not notice the holes until I got  it running and was searching for exhaust
leaks.  I don't want to remove heads to make sure whatever lenght I coose
doesnt interfere with either the valves or impede flow.
