Subject: Re: [T2] alignment done, problems still

&gt; I went to an alignment shop after replacing my tie-rods.  I new the

&gt;
&gt; right.  The front camber was fine.  They told me because one tie-rod
&gt; is non-adjustable my steering wheel is going to be rotated right a
&gt; little and it is about 30 degrees.

They're .wrong.

There ARE two adjustable linkages in your steering system....the second
one is the drag link that connects the steering box arm to the swing lever
on the beam.

Once the toe is set correctly, the next step is center the wheels (done
easiest on the 'rack...), pop the front drag link end out of the socket,
then center the steering box.  (turn to left full lock, count the revs
till right full lock..back up half way.  Ignore the spokes.)

Now, with the steering box in center (some boxes have a nice little mark
showing center that the arm lines up with...this makes it easier. But
something this still isnt right. See the Bentley.), you adjust the
draglink end to make up the difference.

&gt; First question: can I take off the steering wheel, re-align it
&gt; horizontally and re-seat it?

no!

If, after the above is done correctly, and you have a baywindow, chances
are someone has removed and installed the wheel incorrectly in the past.
You may NOW remove it and center it.

&gt; Second question:  They measured the camber in the rear and it was -2
&gt; degrees instead of about -50.  They asked me about tire wear but I
&gt; didn't notice any with my last set of tires.

eh? -2 degrees vs -50 degrees or -.50 degrees?  Slightly excessive
negative camber seems to be the norm, on the rear, for IRS buses.  I dont
have the bentley in front of me to pull the actual spec, but 2 degrees
sounds a like a bit to much.  You may want to look at your rear trailing
arms to see if they've been bent, OR if your rear wheel bearings have
enough slop in them to cause this.


&gt; Anyway, we went through the Bentley and the procedure was to reset the
&gt; rear torsion bars which they do at their shop.  What should I do?

Of course, excessive rearend sag can cause this, too.  Is it saggy?
