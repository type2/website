Subject: Re: [T2] Toolkit for bus pickup trip

Yup,, the Best one I own is a 7mm,, 6pt... that is for bleeder screws!
Then again,, I really like that 6pt set,,,
I nearly bought a 6pt  to fit my rear axle nuts,, but they wanted $60 for the
wrench,, and I got the socket, drive bar, and handle extension for $40....

Jamie ,,, never seen a million dollars, but some one has that much.... Rivers

&gt; Hey,  Librarian suggested taking 6-19mm 6-point box end wrenches
&gt;
&gt; Do many of you out there have a 6-point metric box wrench set??  [[WRENCH,
&gt; not SOCKET...]]
&gt; I have only seen the 12-point wrench sets.
