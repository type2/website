I recently creased the front of my '78 Westy (didn't put a mark on the
old Chevy that I tapped....much higher bumper!).  I remember a
discussion (and a set of plans) from years gone by that detailed a
&quot;bull bar&quot;, possibly Australian in origin.  The bull bar plan included
a mount for the spare tire on the front.  I couldn't find the same in
the archives.  Help anyone?
