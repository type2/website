Subject: Shifting OK

Hi All,

Thanks to everyone that offered suggestions about my shifting problem.

Going with the simplest idea first, I adjusted the clutch cable. Since this
issue had been coming on gradually, I thought it might be something as
simple as a stretched cable. I gave the adjuster 4-5 turns and now it
shifts fine.

I know there might be more problems down the road but I'm shifting
easier now than in the 4 months I've owned the bus.

Thanks again,

Pete
