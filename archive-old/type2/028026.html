Subject: retrofit fuel injection
Message-ID: &lt;HOIDJBHNOBNHAAAA_at_hotbot_dot_com&gt;

 Another (somewhat expensive initally, but maybe not in the long term) option for those who want fuel injection or better fuel injection is the setup marketed by Turbo City (http://www.turbocity_dot_com/VW/vw.html)
It is a closed-loop (i.e., O2 sensor), GM throttle-body setup using all new parts, sensors, computer, etc.  Should replace anything you currently have.  I had an '83 Pontiac 1.8L with a similar factory setup.  Went over 183,000 miles without any trouble (finally dontated the car for a tax writeoff, but it still ran great!)
