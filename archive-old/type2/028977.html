Wow, thanks for the beating. Our racks are completely overhauled. Honed
bearing new grease all mounting hardware including new WCM seals. All motors
are tested and every part we sell is guaranteed for 30 days. We sell quality
products. We sandblast, prime and paint most mechanical parts. We also
repair any broken fixable parts. This is not a swap or a pick and pull. We
take pride in our products and stand behind them. I'm glad you can find
cheaper parts and we encourage people to shop around. We offer quality used
parts for folks that do not have access to a vw salvage yard and we give
them a product which is far superior to a pick and pull. I'll bite my tongue
now.

&gt;from any year bus. The '73-'79 is the most popular. We sell used complete
&gt;racks for $65 and motors for $75. We also sell every little part and piece

Oof as in $140 for a complete wiper motor and rack assembly?  You
mean like same as I can get for $20 at a swap meet?

Hell I wouldn't give that for a complete parts bus.  I offered Ric a set
folks (free) but all I got is later style.  Somebody hook him up already.
Course with Chris's new aquisition maybe he is already hooked up.

Still trying to get rid of the '81 top BTW volks, maybe the free part is
the problem so...

For SALE:  1981 westy top with fair/good canvas $1250 8-)

OK maybe not but how about this as it might have been dissuading
folks.  FREE if you pull away the whole van or $200obo and I'll have the
top off and waiting to tie down on top of yours for the ride home, and
will even sawz-all the roof off for that if you want it (like you should.)
The $200 will also entitle you to anything left of the van that does not
stop it rolling.

This van WILL be crushed with all new front A-arm parts, good steering
rack, all signal lenses and electrical, etc come my return from Germany
on the 15th of August.  I need a spot for the '93 parts van to sit and that
is the spot.  I don't need Vanagon parts.

Pics still at:

in Clarksburg, WV.  (BTW if THAT is the problem I will drag the
complete van anywhere within 200 miles for the same $200/obo)
