Subject: Re: Splittie Authenticity

There are no comprehensive books on split to say what year came with exactly
which parts.   You can call up parts places etc. and pick people's brains, 

The best source for engine details is actually, an original copy of the
owners handbook that came with the car.  These were updated every year,
sometimes mid year.   They have nice engine shots.    

Also, original VW Parts Lists, and Workshops manual have good info, but be
careful of making sure it is an appropriate printing, as Parts are sometimes
NLA, something else listed for replacement, which works,but not what would
have been on it new from the factory.

The bails for the valve cover gaskets were painted black.
