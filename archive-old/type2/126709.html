Hi Terry,

You're right too.... This is an open court and everyone is entitled to 
an opinion, even if it's wrong. And I'm humble enough to admit to not 
being right 100% of the time.

There are lots of valid reasons people have for substandard work... 
Time, skill  and materials are not universally available. I have three 
kids at home and a limited workspace available to me. Money isn't 
always flush either. I appreciate a nicely painted bus as much as the 
next guy, but if I'd painted the westfakia at a &quot;Pro&quot; shop instead of 
Maaco then I'd still be scouring the streets looking for bottles to 
return to pay for it. (I bet a third of this list is too young to 
remember returnable soda bottles. We haven't had them here in Ontario 
since forever). Everyone has priorities. I value paint as a 
preservative more than as a fashion statement. YMMV.

Maaco paint put my Westfakia on the road 4 seasons ago for $400. It 
will need attention next year, but it's looked great in the meanwhile. 
I have managed to rack up about 35000 miles on it since then and our 
family has had a hell of a good time. It hasn't won any trophies for a 
meticulous restoration, but it has brought home two awards for 
&quot;People's Choice&quot;, and it gets smiles and waves almost everywhere it 
goes. Next year I'll sand it down and pull the windows and throw some 
more at it, or perhaps I'll do something different with it. If we win a 
lottery in the meanwhile I might even get it done &quot;properly&quot;, esp. if 
the sunroof bus is available to drive in the meanwhile.

Today I'm packing it up and loading the westrailer for the trip to 
BusFusion... Frank is expecting well over 100 buses and our local club 
will have at least a dozen there, several of whom are new members I'm 
looking forward to meeting.

Happy trails,

Greg Potts

&gt; So, in my opinion--this situation is in the same ballpark-
&gt;
&gt; Why go through all the motions and use substandard materials and
&gt; application devises--and wind up with just an OK squirt job?
