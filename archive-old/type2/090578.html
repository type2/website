Roberto,

Well, after 25 years, etc. etc. they could mean anything :-( What they
*should* mean is 10 BTDC, 7.5 BTDC, and TDC reading from left to right.
(Someone check me on that... my dyslexia may be striking :-( VW, however
made so many different pulleys thru the years with so many different marks
and since they all fit, they tend to get switched around a lot...  these
days I trust *none* of them.  Bad as they are (and they can be *very*
bad), I tend to install degree wheel pulleys on T1 engines when I have to
deal with one on a semi-permanent basis.

&gt; Distributor : Single vacuum dual advance
&gt; JFUD4
&gt; BOSCH 0 231 168 015
&gt; VW 043 905 205L

This dist is not listed on Jim Thompson's site. but a &quot;111 905 205L&quot; is
listed and I would guess is the same dist for the US (and bug) market.
It is listed as being for a 1965 40HP beetle.  The timing for that dist is
listed as &quot;10deg BTDC Static or _at_ 800-950rpm w/strobe w/vacuum hose
disconnected and plugged&quot;  If they are truly the same dist (vacuum advance
*only*) then your timing of 0 is way too retarded and would explain your
power loss.  I would try the 10BTDC(static) spec and watch for heat for a
while.  If it seems to be running hot, I would drop back to 7.5BTDC.
