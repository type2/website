Subject: Re: [T2] why not GL5?..the answer and a question

&gt; Here's my version. GL-5 is too slick. It allows the Porsche patent syncros
&gt; in the T-II tranny to slip, not grab like they should, and they wear much
&gt; faster. Once you wear through the spezial moly rough coating replacement is
&gt; the only fix. All the early trannies that use this Porsche ring syncro
&gt; design need the GL-4 spec to work properly without wear.

No. You can read this is a hundred different papers. Too much sulfer
CORRODES yellow metals.
