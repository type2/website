Subject: Re: [T2] Semi-stalled on the Riviera progress

&gt;From: Don Tuleja

&gt;When I did the clutch cable on my 73,  I discovered that I needed 3
&gt;arms: One to pull the cable taut, one to pull the lever forward, and
&gt;one to attach the wingnut.

&gt;The lever on the transmission needed to pbe pulled 2 or so inches
&gt;toward the front of the bus.

&gt;It took several minutes to figure out that pulling up the pedal (as
&gt;you did with the bungee) would help keep the cable in position so I
&gt;would only need 2 arms. ;-)


I replaced on a '73 just a few weeks ago. I only needed two arms. Did you 
check the new cable for correct length or possibly mis-routed? From my own 
experience I did not have this problem. 3215mm cable should be the correct 
length. Good luck with your move, hope t goes as smooth as mine did and you 
don't need any extra arms. ;-)

Happy Holidays,
