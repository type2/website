Subject: Re: [T2] CONTINUED---78 2.0 with air leak......

it looks like it might just be a vacuum leak after all. (this is good)
From what i could tell in the pics all you need is vacuum lines. These
you can get from any FLAPS. I don't know for sure, but i imagine they
can hook you up with the t connector as well. I don't have it handy
now, but someone sent me a diagram on where these lines go.
