Subject: Re: [T2] speakers in my Westy-covers

IF concerned with dust getting through, Get Fiberglass air conditioner/
furnace filter (Home Depot- comes as sheets also).  Use this as a liner
beneath a surface grill of your choice- Metal with the interesting
punched patterns like for radiator covers, Burlap, or even colored
needlpoint backing, which is what I used.  The latter is at a typical
fabric/craft store like JoAnn's or So-Fro.  It's a plastic mesh.   Cut
to fit, and tack or staple the edges.  You can add &quot;trim&quot; made from
edgings from the fabric shop or scour a lumber yard to see what trim is
offerred.  If the speaker is mounted behind the hole you cut, the
radiator cover stuff is the most flush- see home depot!
