Subject: cursed ignition system- orange spark

Hi all...

I can't seem to figure out why I have an orange spark.

Here's what I've got:

pertronix electronic ignition
all new plugs, wires, rotor, cap
13 (!) volts at the coil

With the original black coil I get a weak orange spark, so
I bought a pertronix flame thrower from JC Whitney and that gives a
decent sized spark, but It's bright orange... Since I bought it from JC
Whitney it didn't seem all that unlikely the coil could be bad, so today
I headed to NAPA for yet another ignition coil. They charged me 35 bucks
for a &quot;stock&quot; (generic NAPA brand) coil... I tried it and it was the
worst of the bunch, can't even spark if I hold it more than a few
milimeters away from the fan housing, and even with it almost touching
it is a teeny little orange line... I tried to return it and they
wouldn't take it back, they even tried to accuse me of frying it by
using it in a non-stock application! after listening to them rant for a
few minutes I left them the coil for them to send to the factory for
them to see if it is defective... 

So... any ideas on how to lift this curse?

My tractor gets a nice blue spark (stop laughing!) so tomorrow I'm going
to try my coil on it to see if it works any better... maybe I just have
really really bad luck with ignition coils...
