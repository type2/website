Indeed.

A few potential problems I see...this is a 73, with no engine in it, yes?

Now, all 1973 buses were built to carry the type4 style engine. Euro
models had the option of the 1600cc upright engine.  This engine used a
very modified set of tinwork, as well as a very different rear engine
hanger.

Without the tin, or the hanger, you have a lot of work ahead of you.

What makes you think the bus is setup for a &quot;bug&quot; motor?  Both engine
styles bolt to the transaxle the same way, with the same bolt pattern.


One CAN run an upright engine in these buses, and even just hang it off of
the upper tranmission hanger.  But this hanger was NOT designed to support
an entire engine...it attaches with two bolts to the top of the transaxle
bellhousing.

you'll still need to fabricate or locate a functioning set of engine tin
to keep the vital cooling air in the proper places.


If you just bought a longblock, you'll need complete tin, fuel delivery,
ignition, and exhaust sytems on top of that.


You may be better off finding a complete 72-74 bus junkyard engine....of
course, the engine itself may be questionable...but then, isnt it always?


babble.
