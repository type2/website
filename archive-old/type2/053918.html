Subject: Head Temperatures

The gentlemen and ladies on the vanagon list have appeared to be useless.  I have a 82 vanagon with a 78 engine.  I just installed a VDO head temp guage under the spark plug and am seeing 375-425 readings on the highway at  65 in 90 degree heat.

I have been driving now for 35 hours over 4 days and about 1700 miles.  It seems to run just fine, but I don't know if I am just waiting for something to blow??

Also there is a bit of lore about being able to touch the dipstick if its OK.  I can hold the handle of the dipstick while it is still in the engine. (while chanting in verse to ignore the pain).  It doesn't really burn my fingers, but it does sting after holding it.  I find the the rear bumper is untouchable, however.  In any case when if there is a problem with running too hot, should I be able to touch teh dipstick and not go away with blisters??

Thanks,

David

PS.  My comment towards the vanagon list is simply to give you guys a chance to show them up, so don't take offense if you read both lists!
