Subject: Re: [T2] Re: Engine tin screws

Hi Volks,

I will second Collie's observation on this.. We recently tore down a 
412 engine that had been sitting for a decade or two, and the tin 
screws were extremely well integrated with the tin. We heated them up 
with a propane torch and pressed a candle to them and screws that had 
laughed at us before suddenly spun out like new. This engine had been 
rebuilt by VW and all the tin was held in place with slotted screws.

It helps a lot to have the engine on a stand in front of you. Dripping 
hot wax in your eyes isn't recommended.

My personal preference for re-assembly is to use common hex-head M6 
bolts in 10 or 15mm lengths, IIRC they are commonly available at Home 
Depot for about $.06 each and can be easily handled with a quarter-inch 
drive ratchet or hand driver.

Happy trails,

Greg Potts

&gt;&gt; For those of you with the slotted screws, try breaking the frozen grip
&gt;&gt; they have on the tin with vise grips before destroying them with that

&gt;
&gt; OR, you could give the stuck screws a paraffin wax treatment before 
&gt; you use
&gt; the BIG screwdriver to turn them. I am still amazed at how well the wax
&gt; works itself under and into the threads.
