&gt;Your deck height is way low. Muir says no less than .040&quot;, a &quot;high
&gt;performance&quot; engine will have deck height of no less than .060&quot;, and some

As usual don't listen to Muir or Wilson for a T4, that deck height
is right on typical for a T4.  Do the math folks.  Stock that would have
been 0.025&quot; deck height + 0.009&quot; shim + 0.030&quot; head gasket for
0.064&quot; or so deck, now at 6.94cc/0.040&quot; (per mm) for a 2.0 liter 94mm
barrel, we get 11.1cc from total stock deck.  56 in the chamber (that is
on the high side BTW even for a set of AMC heads, make SURE it is
really there) + the 15cc is 82.1cc total in the chamber compressed or
(492.7+82.1)/82.1 = 7:1 CR, which is actually a tad lower than stock
using the stock head gasket and shim.  Probably cause German heads
are usually closer to 52cc in the chamber.  If one were to wisely/unwisely
build this without shims or head gasket 0.025&quot; is more than sufficient
clearance for moving parts BUT that would be only 75cc total in the
chamber all said and done for 7.6:1 CR.  Whether that is too high, just
right, or whatever depends on your personal faith and what sort of gas
you intend to run.  I would build it there for use in a Bus, in a vanagon
at least in my '82 with an auto tranny, that runs pretty hot and doesn't
really make a darn bit of difference to seat of the pants performance,
the difference between 65 and 68 hp trying to move 2.5 tons isn't a whole
lot of difference.

Regardless Muir's words are as often the case somewhere between
foolish or just not applicable to the T4 engine.  0.020-0.030 decks are
right common on the T4.  Again my worry here is the 56cc in the heads,
if it is actually there fine, otherwise things may go together at closer to
8:1 or so.  Which again might be fine, but don't go thinking that a point
of CR is going to make a Vanagon any faster such that you'll notice it
volks, you'd get as much out of smoothing the ports or probably seem
to get as much having the engine spin balanced.  The only thing you'll
likely see is an engine that runs 230F at 65mph instead of 215F.  Real
words of advice from my last two Vanagon engines.
