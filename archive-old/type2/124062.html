Subject: Vanagon Interior

So ... I spoke to a guy this morning who asked me to post the following.

He has a complete Vanagon Westy interior for sale - complete and never camped
in - dat's right - complete and never camped it.  Apparently the Vanagon body
is shot but the interior is mint - it comes complete with pop-top and tent (I
think he means the canvas that is attached to the top)  - anyway - it is for
sale in South Eastern Ontario.

He also has an awesome Vanagaon westy for sale.
