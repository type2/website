Subject: RE: [T2] Type 2 = Truck??

&gt;I've found DMV folks to be rather typical bureaucrats.
&gt;Go in when they are not busy or rushed and they will likely take better
&gt;care of you than if you go in a half-hour before closing on Friday.

A DMV that isnt busy?? Is there such a thing??
Ive never gone into the DMV here in Las Vegas and waited less than 2 hours.
And the 2 hours was just to renew my license!
We wont discuss the 3 DMV trips it took to register the Bus!
