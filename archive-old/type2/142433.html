&gt;    BTW, the &quot;original&quot; VW concept was the Tatra T97...Unfortunately,

HIstory records that Porsche was going to settle with Tatra but Hitler fobid him from doing so and solved the legal problems by invading Czechoslovakia and shutting the Tatra factory down. Much like the stamp holders who were saving to buy VWs before the war, it took years of fighting to receive compensation.
