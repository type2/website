Subject: brakes work, brakes work!

Hi. The latest in my brake saga is that I got everything back together and
the bus stops. I didn't think I could do it. I must admit that all seemed
lost when I couldn't get the axle leak to stop. It turned out that the
small O-ring that goes on the axle next to the rear bearing was all messed
up, and I didn't see it, so I didn't change it. Once I knew where to look
(thanks Fig) it all seemed to make sense. I even drove it a little tonight,
and the brakes work great (no grinding noise). Two of my rear shoes had
metal showing. I've lost the core charge on those; should I make
paperweights from them? Using them as horseshoes is also an option. We'll
see how the brakes work in a week, but right now I am pretty happy. Now I
need a battery, and then back to the restoration. I must say that this bus
is wearing me down, but I did my own brakes!

Two pearls of wisdom(?):
It is a lot easier to check your tranny fluid when the left rear tire is
removed.
They should award the Nobel prize in Physics to the person that invented
the exclamation point axle nut remover tool.

Thanks again,
