Subject: Re: [T2] Bus broken into last night

Good news and OK news. =D

OK news: Took the sliding door handle apart somewhat and found some
pieces on the shaft had come loose. Tightened up the nut, added a bit
of lube, and works perfectly. Except the locking mechanism doesn't
function at all. :-( Neither the key nor the lever inside will lock
the door. I'm going to try again this weekend. I didn't really take it
apart fully, so I may have missed something.

Good news: I pulled the pieces of the stereo out of the dash, found
that some more of the plastic tabs that hold the control panel (front)
to the unit were snapped off. I was already missing one from someone
trying to steal this stereo when it was in my Volvo. I put it back
together and wrapped the #_at_% out of it with black duct tape. Works
just fine, but it doesn't fit into the dash cutout anymore. LoL! I'm
going to retape it this weekend, but at least I've got tunes again!
Yay!
