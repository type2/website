hello list!

i need to replace the boots on rear axle.
i have read dif. stories about dif. types of boots. (ie. brazilian boots = 
no good)  da bus is a '74 westy.

so,

which ones are ok?
where can i get them?
how hard to replace if you live in an apt. complex with no garage area to 
work, only the parking lot?

TIA
paz
