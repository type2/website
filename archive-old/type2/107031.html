&gt; Has anyone here had their heater boxes ceramic coated?

Ask the Canadians who have the worst rust problems:

&gt; I'm looking at using Jet-Hot on some new ones I'm going to buy --
&gt; it costs a bit more than exhaust tape but it should work a whole
&gt; lot better. As far as protecting the heater boxes it would be
&gt; best to have them coated inside and out, but it seems to me that
&gt; the heat exchangers would not work as well if the inside is coated.

Jet-Hot is where many Porsche enthusiasts send their heat exchangers and
exhaust components. It's about $180 for a pair.

Old ones may not survive the cleaning process so it's probably best to have
new ones coated as you intend. If their rust claims can be verified they
will outlive your bus and your next bus.
