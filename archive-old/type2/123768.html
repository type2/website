Subject: Engine removal, what else?

    As I was taking out my starter last night, I thought hey, I've got
the time and one of the four big bolts is already undone...why not go
all the way and pull the engine so I can track down a pretty nasty oil
leak.  I've done it one with a friend before and he will help out in a
pinch if I need it.
    My question to the list is anything else I should keep an eye out
for when the engine is out. Obviously I'll clean her up really nice.
    My buddy says he's got a box full of heat exchangers and since mine
have holes, maybe I'll root through there. What should I look for?
 
I'm a little concerned that I may be missing some tin. Does anyone know
of a good picture or set of photos that show everything?
 
TIA
