When we  assembled the engine, we put back all the shims that were in there 
when we  took it apart. Then we tried to move the crank in and out but it 
wouldn't  budge. Never having built a VW engine before, we used a bar behind 
the  flywheel and applied some force to see if it would move at all. That's  
when we some some movement on the needle in the guage, but as I mentioned  
before I think that was simply the flywheel flexing (&quot;warping&quot; was  probably 
too strong a word to use).




hey Peter there is your problem  You need 2 to 6 thousands end play  and the 
different thickness of shims is how you set it up using only 3 shims no  more 
or less than 3  later  Mark Dearing
