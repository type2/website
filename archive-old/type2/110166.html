Subject: disintegrated pilot bearing

I just pulled the engine on my 78 bus...pilot bearing was desintegrated (sp) 
The only thing left in the crankshaft end is the bearing race. Lots of options 
in pulling this out...torching, cutting, etc. I tried using a slide hammer 
with a angled tip, but no luck cuz the race lip isn't big enough. I know there 
is some kind of special bushing puller tool, but don't have it...any ideas?
