&gt;*Quoth Steve Lashley: &quot;I stopped for gas in New Jersey and the attendant 
&gt;overfilled the tank causing gas to run into the engine compartment for

Sorry to keep this thread alive, but I must tell this sad story.

Three nights ago I was driving through New Jersey in the middle of the 
night, stopped for gas, told the guy &quot;fill it up but don't top it off.&quot; I 
told him this b/c I recently removed the BN4 for repair and instead of 
properly capping the fuel line, I just bent it up and taped it to the engine 
compartment ceiling. Stupid, I know, but it stopped leaking and has been 
fine like that for two months. Anyway, I get back to the bus, and the guy 
says $17, which seems a little high, but I (yes, again stupidly, I'm new at 
this) start it up, and the bus immediately catches on fire. I was not 
exactly cool under pressure, the extinguisher in the bus barely worked, and 
didn't know whether the whole gas station was going to blow, so the long and 
short is the bus burned for about 15 minutes until the fire department came. 
Turns out the gas station attendant barely spoke a word of English and 
almost certainly didn't understand my instructions. I imagine they are told 
to top&amp;n! bsp;em off &amp; sell as much gas as possible (not to blame it on him 
b/c its just as much my fault). I live in the bus, so its like having your 
car and house both go up in smoke.

Today I'm going to have it towed (to Pegasus Bug Shop in Elizabeth, anybody 
heard of it?) to see if its worth fixing. If its not, I may email the list 
and see if anyone wants to go raid it for parts. I'll feel horrible if I 
have to junk it - this thing has lived for 30 years and now I have it for 
three months and kill it. Its a 71 Westy, the engine is burnt to a crisp but 
the rest is in decent shape. Please let me know if you'd be interested, as 
I'll be factoring it into my fix/junk decision.
