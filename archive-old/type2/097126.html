Subject: Clutch removal and replacement

Hello
        I'm Bringing a 78 westy back to life and have decided to replace the
clutch due to the fact that the one currently in my bus is stuck like glue.
I've tried allot of tricks to get the old one unstuck with absolutely no luck.
I've done clutch jobs on vehicles with the type 1 engine but never a type 4. I
was wondering if their was anything other than the standard disconnect of all
wires/linkages/fuel lines I should know about before I pull the motor. On the
type 1's once you've done that 4 bolts and a good jack and you're ready to
install you're new clutch. Just wanting to avoid surprises that always seem to
double the time it takes to complete a task.

Thanks
