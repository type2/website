&gt; &gt; Reason #1: Every bus owner has had the experience of having someone
&gt; &gt; come up to them in front of a gas station/convenience store on the
&gt; &gt; highway, or in a campground, all moony-eyed, saying either that they've
&gt; &gt; always wanted to have one of these (that is, your bus) or they had one
&gt; &gt; once upon a time.  You can be the moony-eyed guy or you can be the guy
&gt; &gt; with the bus. Which would you rather be.
&gt;
&gt; Every other one (the last two, in fact) want to buy the bus on the spot.
&gt; Had one guy leave his card under the wiper.

so far one of em has never caught me in a #_at_*($&amp; for a buck I'd sell the
*_at_#&amp;%)L thing mood

as for the ones that ask if it's for sale I tell em, &quot;everythings for
sale, start putting $100 bills in my hand and I'll tell you when to stop&quot;

&gt; Love the looks and comments from other drivers.

yeah mine as a daily driver and I love coming out to the parking lot and
have someone tell me &quot;I used to have one&quot;  sometimes I reply &quot;I still do&quot;
sometimes I think, sucker! for selling it... or some other less than kind
thing, but not out loud to them...
