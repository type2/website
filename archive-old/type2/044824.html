Hi Bob,

The trans you have is fairly easy.  A simple 3 speed.  Chapter 7 of the Bentley manual
covers it.  If you can rebuild the engine, the trans is not too much more difficult.
Clearences are criticle though.  I'm in Redwood Valley, Northern California.  Near the
intersection of US 101 and SR 20.

Keep Smiling,

Mike
