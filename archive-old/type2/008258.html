&gt; hello eveyone
&gt; 
&gt;  Today despite the fact that it's snowing ( a rarity here ) Ive had
the air
&gt; cleaner out. And as usual some things are confusing me.  I have
'Keeping your
&gt; VW alive', the Haynes manual and the Bently manual but none cover it
in enough
&gt; detail.
&gt; 
&gt; The engine is an AS in a 1600 1971 van, I dont think that effects
the air
&gt; cleaner, just a larger flywheel.  The air cleaner does have a small
counter
&gt; weighted flap near the oil bath end of the snout (crankcase fumes?)
but the
&gt; small pipe next to it is open and completely unconnected, should
this be piped
&gt; to the small pipe next to the oil filler?

Yes, the air flow through the snout creates a low pressure area at
this location.  The weighted flap controls the flow of crankcase fumes 
 
&gt; This weighted flap doesnt have any facility for connecting to the
bellows
&gt; thermostat by cable (nor does it have any mounting nearby for the
cable end),
&gt; from what he books have said, I should expect then to find a second
thermostat
&gt; on the side of the air snout. This is not the case, the snout from
above is
&gt; completely straight whereas the ones shown in the books have a sort of
&gt; shoulder nearest the oil bath to which the thermostat is fixed.
&gt; 
&gt; Even stranger is a sort of 'blob' fixed in place by a wire clip
between the
&gt; air intake and the warm air hose. This blob has a hose going from it
to the
&gt; oil bath lower half. Looking inside the snout, I can see that the blob
&gt; protrudes slightly inside. Is this mysterious blob a different
thermostat or
&gt; some kind of filter for fumes?

You have me there!  The '71 filter has an internal thermostat that
controls the flap that shuts the hot air inlet (the elbow under the
snout) off when the intake temperature gets too high.  The themostat
is contained in the fatter part of the snout near the canister and can
easily be seen after you remove the top of the filter.

My thermostat has long since ceased to be, so I simply install and
remove the air duct with the seasons.  Be sure to plug the hole in the
tin when the duct is out.  I use an expanding rubber freeze plug from
the local flaps

&gt; Anyway, I have answered one question today...the previous owner DID
keep the
&gt; oil bath filled correctly ( he had to do something right!) but I
have an
&gt; unused outlet, and no recognisable thermostat!  let me know what you
think,
&gt; the bus and I will be very gratefull.

On the '71 there are two connections on the air cleaner.  The one
under the snout goes to the oil breather (as you suspected)  The one
that comes off the side of the filter canister goes to the charcoal
canister attached to the roof on the right side of the engine bay. 
Another hose goes from the top right side of the fan shroud to the
charcoal canister.  A third hose goes from the charcoal canister to
the fuel tank.

&gt; The reason for all this work is that in three months I'm off around
Europe for
&gt; half a year and dont fancy overheating out there. Thanks again,

Good thought!  Peace of mind is a wonderful thing!
