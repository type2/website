Subject: Re: 78 Champagne Edition worth?

At the risk of iring the listmasters, there are those who will chime in
on this borderline &quot;pertinant&quot; to type 2's thread......
Don't get rid of it- we've had our 78 Westy since our child was born
(1985) and it was the most useful item when NOT traveling or camping! 
Easy diaper changes!  Put a VCR-TV in the back (built a shelf over the
fridge area spanning between the sink top and the rear cabinet- cut a
new hole in the SIDE of the closet for access, and put a thin ply wall
over the old hole)- and she's never bored on trips watching Chip &amp; Dale!
Fix the upper bunk- kids LOVE being up there (except in thunderstorms-
then be ready to put the mat on the floor or use the front cot).  Easy
access to snacks, bottles, etc also.  Believe me, it's way better than a
&quot;car&quot; upgrade from a scooter!  Seat belts are easy to add to the back to
hold the baby seat.  The front seat when flipped around is safe for the
baby carrier- and MOM can watch the baby while driving.  The moral here
is to convince her it's easier and better to learn to like driving the
commanding view bus!
