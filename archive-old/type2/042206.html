Volks,

My passenger side heat exchanger has a major hole in the rear where it rises 
up to meet the rubber ducts to head up to the front to supply heat to the 
cabin. I don't need the heat cause I only drive the bus in the summer 
anyways, but I was wondering if having this hole in the heat exchanger will 
signifigantly impact my engines performance.

cheers....
