&quot;Go away&quot; is wishful thinking.

A new throwout bearing should be silent.  Either you got a bad new bearing
(not unknown) or the clutch fork has come adrift and things are
misaligned.  In either case the engine needs to come back out to fix the
bearing.  If it turns out to be the clutch fork misaligned I'd replace the
throwout bearing anyway as the misalignment may have harmed it.  Since you
have an early bay, check the clutch fork for wear (the semicircular
cutouts that accept the bearing tend to wear) and replace it if
suspicious.
