Subject: Re: runs bad when cold &amp; cops

runs poorly when cold after engine work was done...

--Maybe they didnt hook up the intake preheater tube 
right. I know on my type4 I didnt get the carb intake
preheater tube hooked on right after working on it and
it ran realy bad when I put my foot in it. When you
are
taking off it will ice up the carb if that preheated
air isnt available.--JAThought

Cops.
 ---In the Pacific NW if the cops pulled over VW buses
all the time they wouldnt have time for anything else.
Waaay to many busers on the road in Seattle.
reading these accounts reminds me of my &quot;younger days&quot;
growing up in Northern Michigan... it aint just down
there in Dixie Volks.
