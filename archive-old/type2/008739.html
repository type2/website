Subject: Alternators and loose washers!
Message-Id: &lt;199903261631.IAA28882_at_beta.tricity.wsu_dot_edu&gt;

This new survey and somebody else mentioning loose washers reminded
me of a problem my dad had with his '77 Westy.

He hadn't driven it for 2 weeks but the battry was dead.  I charged 
the battery and it was dead in a week.  We put a new battery in
(remember Shucks &quot;Lifetime&quot; warrenty on batterys many many years ago?  
Well, this VW has one. &lt;G&gt;)  it and it died in 2 weeks.  We pulled
it and checked all of the cables, etc for problems but found none.
When we put the battery back in, we got some major arcing when we 
tried to reconnect the cables. So, we figured the alternator was dying.
We pulled it out and on a lark, I popped the back cover off.  Inside
next to the diodes was one VERY blackened spring (not lock) washer.
It had been there intermittantly shorting out the electrical system!
We cleaned up the alternator and put it back together and had a 
place test it and every thing was OK with it.  

Anyway, SOMEHOW a washer had managed to get down through the works
and get sucked into the alternator!

The moral of the story, don't leave ANY loose parts float around
the engine compartment!
