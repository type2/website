Subject: [T2] RE: Ignition lock stuck

There are several problems it could be.  The switch itself (seperate from 
the lock) sould be sticking, the lock could be stuck, or key worn too far.  
I would suggest first trying to lubricate the lock with the key in it.  
Though not normally a good lube for locks, I'd shoot WD40 through the keyway 
on each side of the key while trying to work the key by wiggling both up and 
down and left to right.  If that doesn't do it, you'll probably need to tear 
down the column to remove the lock.  It might be that you can remove the 
switch section from the housing without a full teardown.  If you do that, 
you could determine whether the problem is in the lock section or switch 
section.  Check Bentley for teardown instructions.
