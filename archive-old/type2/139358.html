&gt; I'm thinking it might make some sense to fabricate a new flange and get 
&gt; it welded up. Because of the clearances involved, an improvement might 
&gt; be to use 1/4 mild steel and tap the two holes, or at least the one 


If you tap a hole and screw a bolt into it in a high heat area you are
asking for a permabond situation within a few months. Think about what just
about every nut/bolt on an exhaust system looks like in a very short time.
You may as well weld it on permanently now.

I'm not a metallurgist. My brother was a welder/fitter who worked on
systems in the petrochem industry and this is a question that I asked once
that sort of stuck in my head. He was fitting flanges that were to go in a
low pressure steam system and was griping about having to wait to have some
custom length bolts and &quot;thin&quot; nuts made because all the standard sizes
were too long/short/thick to hold a particular flange. I saw the drawing of
the system and the flange in question had to be 3&quot; thick and made of mild
steel so I asked why not just tap the thing and bolt it up that way. His
reply was that they didn't want to have to use a torch to take it apart for
maint/inspect every 12 months and they da** sure didn't want to have to
drill out the old bolts and re-tap it every time it had to come apart. 

If you make it a quarterly (or maybe monthly) PM to back that bolt out and
add a touch of antisieze then tighten it back up then it would probably be
OK. But who's gonna remember to do that?
