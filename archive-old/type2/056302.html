Subject: Re: I need a Trailor Hitch

Craig:

I took a look at my hitch (which is currently not installed) and it is
indeed a Draw-Tite.  What is interesting is that, even though it's
constructed of very heavy (1/2&quot;) steel, it is rated at only 1,000 lbs
gross and 100 lbs. tongue weight.  This relatively light rating is
probably due to the weakest part, which appears to be the two bolts by
which the hitch attaches to the bottom of the bus bumper.
