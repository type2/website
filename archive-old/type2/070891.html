Subject: Installing grease fitting for ball joint
To: &lt;type2_at_type2_dot_com&gt;
Mime-Version: 1.0
Message-ID: &lt;ad.74ed309.27c8155a_at_aol_dot_com&gt;

I'm replacing the ball joints on my '71 bus and the new replacement ball joints do not have the threaded hole in the top, which the original joints have, that allows one to install a grease fitting and re-lube the joint periodically.
I was wondering, has anyone attempted to drill and tap these new &quot;unserviceable&quot; joints to allow a grease (zerk) fitting to be installed?  If so, please fill me in on the details, e.g., success of job, difficulty and tools required.
-Mike
