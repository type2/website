Subject: more  (or less) on 65 camper

first of all a non vw update, as i have also been talking about mice quite a
lot.   they seems to keep on appearing in my life.   Actually another
appeared in my bedroom early this morning, before i wanted to be awake, this
time a live one.  8:&gt;  i am so touched that she (the kitty, Foam Unit) wanted
to share the mouse with me.  it looked a bit worse for wear, moving a bit
slow, so i caught it in a t shirt and sent it outside.   Foam looked a bit
confused.  i hope i didn't offend her.

anyway,  i realised when i went to the garage that the blue seal that should
be in the wheel was on the floor, so i had to take the drum off again (easy
this time)   and put it in the appropriate place.   took me a few to figure
out where, but i believe it is put right now.  :)

Then i had to split and go to work.    i might go out and try to remove a
rear drum now,  it's cooled down from the hot summer midday heat.   must be
only 70 now.  

BTW, thanks to everyone who's responded.  i hope you enjoy this tale.   i
want to get the bus running (stopping, that is)  tomorrow, go down and pay
for the tabs by 4pm, and take it to the car wash in preparation for ye olde
engine pull.       

I  want to drive with the SAFARIS OPEN!!!!!!             (pardon the caps)

rear window?  we don't need no steenkin' rear window!
