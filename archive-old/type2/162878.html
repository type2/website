Busahaulic quoth:

&gt;  the company next door has done
&gt;repairs to Microsoft Bill's Lexus several times. The
&gt;doors on that thing must weigh 500 pounds each! The
window is prob an inch thick.

	When you get over here to the obscure S. Pacific, you can see 
in The Southward Museum  -  one of the world's greatest motor museums 
- the Cadillac limo ('53 if I recall) of one Micky Cohen, a Los 
Angeles gangster  -   extra steel floor welded in throughout, and  - 
yes  -  1&quot; thick windows.  No wonder this vehicle weighs 4 ton.
