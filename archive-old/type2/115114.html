Subject: Go-Fast Busses

I just received my copy of Excellence, the Porsche magazine, and there are
two articles which might interest Bus fans.  The first is about a guy who is
building 4-cylinder versions of the 6-cylinder 911 engine for use in 356s,
911s, etc.  The engine profiled in the article is a twin-plug motor making
around 240 hp.  Sounds like fun.  No word on price.

The second article is about a Split-Window conversion.  Frankly, there isn't
much left of the original Bus.  The front and rear suspension and much of
the chassis has been hacked out and replaced with late model 911 parts.  911
front and rear suspension, custom Fabcar chassis and roll cage, and 300 hp
911 motor.  The outside looks stock except for the low ride height and huge
Porsche alloy wheels.  Vroom-vroom.
