It sounds like it is time for SOMEONE to adjust their shift linkage.
Accidentally downshifting from fourth to first?  I'm not sure how that could
happen accidentally - unless you had absolutely no idea how to drive a
stick-shift in the first place.

&gt; When you're cruising down the road in the fast lane and you lazily sail
past a few hard-driving cars and are feeling pretty pleased with yourself
and then accidentally change down from forth to first instead of third thus
making your engine leap out of your hood in a rather ugly mess it tends to
throw you off your stride....
