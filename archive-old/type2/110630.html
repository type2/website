Subject: westy fridge

Hello, My fridge works great on 120volt power and 12 volt but will not get cold on propane.  The fridge will light(usually the first shot) fine and the flu gets mad hot.  I have a digital thermometer in there and on 120v it will go to 33 to 35 degrees constant on the max setting. The fan on the back of the fridge cyclces on and off as it should.  I have take the fridge out and cleaned the jet, and flu's.  There  are no leaks and I have a very blue flame in the little window in the bottom f the fridge.  In the archives I can not see any other reason why my fridge does not work, except for the above mentioned problems. (Only found cloged burner or flu).  When I opened it up(the combustion chamber) there was hardly any rust at all really clean.  The fridge and van are in stellar shape.   I am the third owner and it has always been garaged kept.  I don't want to have to bring it to an RV dealer to get it fixed becasue there is only one guy in the area and he is kind of expensive and I am not sure he knows how to do it.(he said something about amonia and absorbtion).  I have taken it out and put it back twice now and just have no idea what to do anymore.  I have tried to get a repalacement but that it is proving difficult because the ones I have found are worse than mine.  Any suggestions would be really appreciated. Thanks kristian carney82 westy
