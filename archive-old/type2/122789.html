Subject: RE: [T2] Subaru Van's

I've got a 2.7L flat six in my 69 bay. Its not a Subaru though. It's a
rebuilt 69 Corvair engine ( and matching tranny ). I wanted to keep my
bus aircooled. I can't say it sounds much like a VW anymore. The fweem
is gone. But on the other hand, gone is the stress about merging onto
highways.

&gt;A rice burner Vdub...don't look Ferdenand!

D_at_mn straight!

The engine is half the reason I've got a bus.
