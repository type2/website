Open a window or another door, no where for the inside air to go.

Subject: [T2] Sliding Door Tune-up


&gt; Greetings All,
&gt;
&gt; I'm trying to get my sliding door (70 Bus) to function as it should.  Or
at
&gt; least the way I think it should.  My take on this is that the sliding
door,
&gt; when moved forward, should &quot;pocket&quot; itself in the door space so that it
can
&gt; be latched in place.  Am I right so far?
&gt; I've had to push the rear end of the door into the door space so that I
could
&gt; latch it in place.  Of course this makes closing the slider from the
inside
&gt; of the bus impossible.
&gt; So..............  I took out the center rear sliding hinge link and
cleaned
&gt; and rebuilt that thing.  As a matter of fact everything at the rear of the
&gt; door is cleaned and lubed.  The door has been adjusted ala Bentley.  The
fit
&gt; is perfecto!
&gt; However the door still doesn't want to move into a latching position.  It
&gt; will do so if I really reef on the door and send it forward with a slam.
&gt; But, it seems to me, that I should get the &quot;closing action&quot; with a lot
less
&gt; force.
&gt; Any kind souls out there have any helpful hints for me?
&gt;
&gt; As always, TIA
&gt;
&gt; Mike
