Subject: Windshield Wiper Motor

I read today on the list that someone has just finished installing a new 
wiper motor and I could use some advice.  I have a 78 Riviera with 
air-conditioning.  I have read the Muir and the Bentley and they help but 
they don't deal with how to work around the air-conditioning unit.  Does 
anyone have any advice?  I have tried to work through the glove box but the 
access isn't the best.  Also, I can hear that the motor is spinning (at least 
making the usual sound) but it is not moving the wiper arms.  Is it time for 
a new motor?  Any ideas?  Thanks in advance!
