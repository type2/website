From: &quot;Eron Crites&quot; &lt;emcrites_at_msn_dot_com&gt;
&gt; I wonder if something may have happened to the tow vehicle's lighting?

Are there any aftermarket lighting kits specifically for the rear end of
buses?

After reading this thread, I was toying with adding something to ours.
Maybe a set of those NightRider lights that sequence back and forth, mounted
in the window either horizontally across the top or vertically on both
sides?
