well, with a little &quot;lovin'&quot; the torsion arms came off just fine.....and 
i'm off to the shop today to have the old ball joints pressed out and the 
new ones (and the eccentric bushing) pressed in.

funny, i don't think i have EVER done this much work on any other vehicle i 
have owned.  i'm going all out....wheel bearings, rotors, ball joints, tie 
rods, steering dampener, shocks....and that's just the front end!  i hope 
he'll be riding SMOOVE when i'm done!

thanks for all of the advise volks!

ps.   does anyone know where i can buy some new rubber limiters for the 
torsion arms?  mine have seen better days!
