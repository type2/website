Subject: Re: locked out!!!
Mime-Version: 1.0

This has happened to me twice, and can be approached via using a large
screwdriver, or better, a cat's paw (small) crowbar (had to run into a mall
and buy it at Sears!) plus a coathangar- You have to wrap the tool with
plastic tape and then pry the passenger door  foward at the upper rear
corner.  The wire is bent to form a loop at the end that sicks out 90 deg.
to the vertical run of the wire.  Easier to have one person hold the door
while you play with the wire and snake it down.  This is easier than
messing with the vent lock.   I've also reached the sliding door lock
easily from the louvre windows (were open) even when I had unscrewed the
front door locking buttons!
