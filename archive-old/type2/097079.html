Subject: Felt washer?

Hi Folks,
    71&quot; bus, 1600 engine.  Should the gland nut that holds on the
flywheel have a little felt washer just forward of the pilot bearing?
I thought it should but after checking with my usual FLAPS and on-line
catalogs I can't find any.  I could cut one out of some felt from a
fabric store if it's really necessary, but what does it do anyway?  Is
it to contain the grease in the pilot bearing?  Somebody help me out
here, I'm having a senior moment.
