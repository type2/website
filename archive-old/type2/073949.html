Subject: Stiff suspension

I recently started driving my 79' panel van that I bought back in April. =
The first thing I noticed is that the suspension is alot stiffer than my =
77' westy, at first I thought of the tires, but they are the same as the =
ones on the 77', This thing drives like a TANK, very little body roll. =
Is this because these vans were intended to carry heavy loads and  VW =
beefed up the suspension?

just wondering,

thanks,

Joey.
