Subject: What paint color to hide body work

Hi All;
	I will be doing a repaint job soon but can't decide on a color.  
I am not so much interested in going stock but more in hiding body work.  
while sanding I have found a lot of bondo, pop rivets, sheet metal 
screws.... and will be adding some of my own.  I will be using a lacker 
paint because I hear it is the easiest to spray and the most 
forgiving.(this is my first attempt at body work) This will never be a 
show car, I have counted at least 5 separate areas that have been wrecked 
and repaired in the past, I am just looking for something forgiving and 
half way decent looking for a VDUB that should probably have been parted 
out long ago.  I am currently leaning towards a light cream yellow.  Any 
thoughts?

Thanks.
ED
