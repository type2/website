Subject: RE:  '70 Vs '77 Drivability impressions

&gt;I have found the '70 much easier to drive. The power band seems much 
&gt;wider (1600 sp), it is much easier to shift (just slides into each gear)
and 
&gt;has a smoother ride. Clutch action is more smooth and linear ('77 seems 
&gt;to have a digital clutch). This is all with over 300k miles.
&gt;
&gt;Of course, the big plus for the '77 is the FI, which makes it easy to start

300k miles?  I'd do a compression test to begin with.  Any engine with that
kind of mileage is likely to be needing a good rebuild.  If it's got really
low or uneven compression, there's your answer for the poor power.  As for
poor shifting, you'll want to check all of the shift bushings and make sure
everything is lubed up nice.  Any problems with clutch feel are probably
attributable to a worn out clutch or something badly out of spec.  The ride
should be the same as the 70 since the suspension is the same.

Bottom line is a 77 2.0 with FI should have better power (low end and top
end) than your 70 and all the other pieces should work/feel at least as
well.  Start sorting through everything and I'm sure you'll have it all
whipped into shape in no time.
