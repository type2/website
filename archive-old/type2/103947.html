Considering that the life of CV joints is usually over 100K miles
(sometimes _way_ over), there is probably not enough data out there for
the time that the reman axles have been available.

I'm a bit suspicious of the idea of &quot;remanufacturing&quot; CV joints.  Sounds
to me like they are taking old axles, keeping the OK CVs, and making up
the deficit with new CVs.  Could be a good deal, could be a
failure in
1000 miles.
