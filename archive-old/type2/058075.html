Subject: RE: Saulte Ste. Marie US/Canada border crossing

Tom &amp; Dawn,
  Being a Yooper in exile (Yooper: Resideing in the upper pennisula of
michigan all year by choice!) I dont think the Soo border crossing will 
be an event. The U.P. harbors a colorfull cross section of people,
though
VW buses are not the norm due to the giant rust moths that inhabit this 
region.
  You better check on what shot records are required to take the dog
though.

Now I recommend stopping in the Les Cheneaux Island area (Cedarville,
MI)
which is due east after crossing da Mackinaw bridge. There are places to
camp
there. After you have seen all there is to see in town (15 minutes or
so) you
can head straight north to the Soo via a two laner (31 miles), nice
drive through rural MI!
  You can go to my V-Dub pages and find the Yooper links to see some
Les Cheneaux sights. E-mail me direct if you want more info on da U.P.,
eh!

way.  Crossing into CANADA through Sault Ste Marie with destination
being somewhere in Maine.  
I am concerned about problems with our k-9 family member and possibly
just a general disapproval of our lifestyle.
Also looking for places to camp, a route to take or just any other
opinions, info, advisement's, points of interest ..........
