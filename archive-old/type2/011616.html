Small paint marks &quot;plus&quot; and &quot;minus&quot; above the appropriate hole help, it's
either that or remembering that up is in and out is down or lying face down
for the other side ones as they are the same but different depending on
which way you look. Ahh well you know we have less trouble with that up here
on top of the world but for you folks wandering around upside down I guess
you need all the help you can get. Hey it was friday here yesterday and the
effect can linger.   :&lt;)
