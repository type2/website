 Wolfgang Int. are the importers from Scholfield. (I used to)

  The 3 piece windshield repair you were/are looking for can be made by any
metal fab shop for less money then Schofields.
  There are good and fair pieces made by many companies and I would suggest
talking to someone www.metwiz_dot_com that has pretty much tried EVERYONE'S
metal repair pieces and can tell you who has the best.
  There are also a lot of independents here in the U S that are also making
repair parts.
  Now available on a limited basis bottom SC/DC gate repair channels. These
are the bottoms of the gates, you know the ones that always rust out. All 3
pieces for both side and rear gates $150.00 dollars a set.
Not available separate YET

Folks,

Can anyone confirm these US distributors for Alan H Schofield body panels
mentioned in the archives?

http://www.wolfgangint_dot_com/
http://www.bus-boys_dot_com/
http://www.type2parts_dot_com/

They have a 3 piece under the windshield repair panel for #25.00. See #29 on
http://www.ahschofield.co_dot_uk/page6.htm.

None of the above websites have any info about this panel in their catalogs
and it's just what I need.

I have no idea who else is making body panels for bays but is this item
available from anyone else? I understand Veng is gone but who is the other
European maker of body panels?
