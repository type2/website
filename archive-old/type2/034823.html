&gt;Hi all
&gt;This past weekend I picked my Wife and Girls up at the airport, Returning
&gt;from 2 weeks stay in Florida.

&gt;It is great to make people feel so Happy!


Ain't it the truth. And with a modicrum of aforethought, not very hard to
do, as your example proves. I believe the New Beattle will be just like the
T-I (the most successful motor vehicle ever produced). Young people will
use them until the children come, then move up to, these days, an MVP. I
just wish VW could put out something descent in the way of a New Type II
(the most successful MPV ever produced) that cost on the lesser side of
$25,000. 

VWoA is producing big volumes of Golf/Jetta, et al, in Mexico. Keeps the
cost down a lot over German or US labor rates. From observations of the
newer (92+) vehicles and parts assembled in Mexico, I speculate as follows:

Materials and component parts are being shipped to Mexico from all over the
world, more especially from Germany and the US. Sacks/Borg Beck Clutch kits
for Type II are German steel and US friction material shipped to Mexico for
assembly. Sacks clutch parts (separatly packaged) are all German parts and
assembly, as of the last few months. 

Comparing the rivots that bind the lining on the disc, the hole in the
rivot center is dead round by eye on the German article but on the Mexico
article are obviously ovate and mashed poorly by, again I spectulate, worn
dies or presses or too long between press calibration and adjustment with
inadequate inspection or specification of &quot;finished&quot; units.

The Mexico assembled cars would appear to me a great deal of German parts,
high spec hoses and hardware being quite evident. A good deal of genuine
Bosch stuff on there as well. More and more fiber/plastic fittings, all of
which will serve quite well long past a 5 or 7 year warrenty life with a
reasonable maintenance inspection frequency.

If you think a 25 year old Westy is a problem because each year several of
those long lived parts begin to fail year, just think what your grandchild
will face with a 95 EuroVan in the year 2020??? You think there are too few
experienced knowledgable Type II mechanics in your region today?? How thin
will DigiFant/Jet and Motronic aces will there be available to our
prodgeny???  

Just think, in a few years you will be able to use an audio/visual head set
to beam your eye sight to my screen and I could advise to the detail you
require to &quot;fix it yourself&quot; with a bit of tricks and tips from someone who
has performed the procedure dozens of times. Some mutual value can be
recognized, real-time knowledge gained, safety issues insured for the
novice, ect.

How about you could log onto my site and call up for download the start to
finish Jetronic diagnostic procedures with step by step explainations of
the details as they are addressed???

How about watch the schedule and log in for tomorrows brake system
inspection and repair in real-time through my headset/video broadcast??

You could hear every wrench drop, hear every expletive, shout
&quot;ausgezeitnet&quot;  with me when the glitchy ignition module is confirmed
epirically as the culprit for the intermitant &quot;no-run scratch head poke a
few screwdrivers&quot; rituals of the past several weeks.

Any ideas about perceived value here??? How much per minute/hour would this
info be worth?
This is getting pretty close to the definition of &quot;clarvoyance&quot;.

It's agonna be a gas.
