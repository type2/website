&gt;i went to radio snack and picked up a 12v piezo buzzer - 03a99 if i recall
&gt;correctly.
&gt;then i connected one buzzer wire to the black wire that feeds to the black
&gt;plastic housing in which the bulbs sit, and then took the other wire from
&gt;the buzzer and attached it to a ground (screw under dash).
&gt;look under your dash it it should be more obvious than i'm describing.
============================&gt;
I was thinking to do similar for the oil indicator lamp.

Correct me if I am wrong,
as I am going from my memory of the circuit, but............ 1970 bus

As I recall, the oil pressure bulb is wired:
normal state (bulb off) - positive completed,
with the ground connection, normal state - not completed.

The &quot;light on&quot; (failure state) is achieved by completing the bulb's ground 
circuit.

A piezo buzzer could be wired to a B+ hot spade on the fuse block,
and the buzzer ground would then be connected to the bulb's open ground 
circuit.

When the oil indicator lamp is grounded (failure state), the buzzer is 
grounded along with the bulb;
both come on, or one would act as backup for the other, should one fail.
