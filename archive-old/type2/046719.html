&gt; Why are these great events all at the wrong side of the country? :)

We don't get a lot of punkins out this a-ways.

I'm goin'. :-P
 
&gt; Oddly enough, my students and I are building a siege engine this year
&gt; (specifically, a floating counterweight trebuchet), though our efforts
&gt; won't be of the magnitude of these machines.  One requirement is that we
&gt; should be able to fit it into the bus so that we can take it to bus
&gt; events!

I wanna see it!

The punkin chunk expedition began when I found it on the web -- there's
a cannon attached to a VW Dasher (which is just about all a Dasher's
good for, according to my dear departed dad). I send the page to Steve
and it turns out he's been meaning to go for a while now.

OBC -- I dropped the gas tank for 69 off today to get a good cleaning. I
told the guy to avoid the acid bath as I'm not keen on losing my little
paddy things, and he said the interior looked pretty good by flashlight.
I'll have it back in a couple of days. Is there a way to determine if
the gauge mechanism is NG before you install the engine and hook
everything back up?
