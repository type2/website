ok ok.  heres something i know a bit about. i run a 72 westy with a later 2.0
motor and all cooling tin and seals in place with a temp sending unit as my
filler plug.

having just completed 9000 miles around the u.s. from the heat of texas to the
cold on wyoming i can say that if you wanna help your temp use synthetic oil,
mobil 1.  

i started out in fl using castrol 30w. went to 40w. had temps in texas of
almost 260. oil pressure was way down, temp was up.  got 4000 miles to napa ca
and put in mobile 1. what a difference. temps never went over 240 again and
oil pressure was way up.

david schwarze told me that synthetic is the way to go before i left fl. i
wished id have listened. he is soooo smart............
