Subject: odometers

Got a simpler question this time..
Lorax the `80 vanagan has only one thousand more miles than the day the
previous owner signed &quot;his&quot; title. So, the lorax reads 94860 in 1984 so
lord knows how many bus years that converts to.
where is this odometer cable, how do I replace/hook it backup.
I can't seem to find this info any where...
