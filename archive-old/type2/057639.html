Subject: remote control VW mechanic in Alameda, CA area?

I am *still* looking for a type2 westy. To be precise I am looking for a
76-78 chrome yellow westphalia in good-great condition. My hopes were
recently dashed when I found a '77 near Seattle that was described to be
perfect but in fact had a pushed in nose and a rebuilt 2.0 stripped of FI
and converted to the venerable Weber progressive/009 configuration :( I've
been looking hard in Seattle for most of the summer but have had zero luck
finding the right bus for me. I've even had 2 of them in$pected (both non
yellow and both needing full rebuilds). Maybe I'm to choosy.

So tonight I get a call from a woman in the Bay area with an excellent 76
Westy -- and it's &quot;my&quot; color (I realize color infatuation is sort of
infantile but I have sentimental attachment to that funky yellow). Her
asking price ($3K) seems high for a 110K motor. I'd like to have it's
compression tested but my gauge won't reach down to the Bay area from
Seattle. She has paper documenting regular valve adjustment, oil changes,
etc.. Can anyone help me? I need to know the name of an affordable,
reliable, mechanic nearby her that she might be able to take it to. If it
checked out I might be able to justify the cost of going down there to bring
it back.

thanks for your help!
