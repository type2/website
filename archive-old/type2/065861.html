Subject: Brakes on 71 Westy

Hello,

Thanks everyone for the info on the brake hoses.  I ended up changing three
of them and the fourth will be done tonight.  All four though were
extremely gunked up.  I was unable to blow through any of them like the new
ones.  I also replaced most of the metal ones because while trying to take
the hoses out I ended up twisting several of them due to rust.  Hopefully
this will fix the brakes and I might be able to finally get it inspected
after working on it for 1 year 8 months from the time I bought it for 180
dollars. :)

I really appreciate all the help.

Stephen
