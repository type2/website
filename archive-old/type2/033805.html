I am trying to buy my husband a radio for his bus for Christmas but no
one seems to be able to tell me which ones will fit without cutting the

if so
could you let me know what model it is.
Thanks

Crutchfield has the Kenwood deck that is 'shaft mounted'. Kenwood
KRC-2007.
They work fine, no cutting necessary. Has most of the bells and whistles
needed.
Reasonably priced as well. Only $99.95.
Call Crutchfield at 800-955-6000 or see their website at
