Subject: Re: [T2] no oil pressure on fresh rebuild

Hello Guys  I just vwent thur this with a motor,  I assume it is a  type 2/4 
motor if so pull the oil filter off and crank the motor to see if it is 
getting to the filter, The filter was my problem it wouldn't allow the oil thur it. 
If you aren't getting oil up to the filter try pumping oil back into the motor 
going down to the pump, this will prime the oil pump.  Do not rev the engine 
till you do get oil pressure  later and have fun  Mark Dearing   Salem Import
