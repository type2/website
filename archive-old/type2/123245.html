Subject: Re: [T2] white dot and clutch alignment

Richard,

I seldom see the marks any more, so just line up the balancing
holes opposite one another.

The flywheel will probably have some extra holes(balancing) drilled in it
so that means that edge was probably a little heavy.  If the pressure 
plate has some balancing holes, then they go 180 degrees off.

Works great unless someone took too much out when they drilled and that is 
now the &quot;light&quot; side.

Cheers, dave

&gt; I just noticed that Bentley makes mention of aligning the clutch with the flywheel 180 degrees with respect to a white dot for balancing. Are the dots still used?
