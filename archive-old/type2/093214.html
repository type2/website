Subject: Re: [T2] Battery tray replacement alternative


&gt;Granted it's not as good as a welded job, but what I did was chisel out the
&gt;old, rotten trays, leaving a small (maybe 3/4&quot;) lip, which I de-rusted
&gt;pretty well with wire brushes, rust killer and dirty looks.  Then I made a
&gt;cardboard template and had sheet metal plates made up at a welding class
&gt;(don't know the gage, but good stock, much heavier than what came out.  They
&gt;had it on hand.) and epoxied it back in.  The ledge gave a good seat for the
&gt;new plates, the fit was very snug (a good template + a little filing) and
&gt;the epoxy did the rest.   Paint it, bolt down a battery hold down tray after
&gt;painting and that's it.  Still looks good (a couple of years ago) and is
&gt;very solid.
&gt;
&gt;No welding, just elbow grease.  If anyone wants a copy of the template,
&gt;pmail me and I'll copy it onto good stiff paper and mail it to you (sorry,
&gt;no CAD file available for this one).

Another method for bodywork has surfaced. I have no direct experience with 
it but I hear good things.

There are now epoxy type adhesives for bodywork. You GLUE in panels versus 
welding them in. Something to try with non-important things like battery 
trays and such. Not sure I would glue hinges to a door or rocker panels on 
a convertible though.... &lt;grin!&gt;
