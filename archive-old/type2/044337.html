Subject: [T2] 1600 Exhaust or Not?

Hello everyone.  I am new to the list so I hope I got this post right.

I have not had my Transporter Campervan (Vanagon) long.  I believe
that it is called a series 4 (1982) but am not sure, however, it has a
1600 air-cooled engine.
I was going down a steep hill in Wales recently, in a low gear, when
it back-fired and the exhaust became very noisey.   On investigation I
found that a hole had appeared in a pipe, about 15 mm diameter (3/4&quot;)
which branches off the inlet manifold, to the left of the carburetor,
and bends down the back of the engine.   The pipe does not seem to be
part of the main exhaust system and I cannot figure out why it is
there.   I shall have to replace it but it is not evident whether it
is an integral part of the inlet manifold or if it can be replaced as
a separate part.   If the former is the case it looks an expensive
job.    I am sure someone must have had this problem.
