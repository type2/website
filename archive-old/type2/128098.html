&gt; Well, to answer my own question: The guys at Bill and Steve's say it won't

Are you talking about a muffler for a stock bug?  If that is the case, it
will fit the baywindow, as the apron on the bay doesn't have the cutout
for the tailpipe.

Not recommended, though, as the stock tailpipe is designed to prevent CO
from leaking into the rear hatch.
