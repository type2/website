Subject: Re: [T2] Just picked up my new Bus....

&gt; since I've gotten it. Basically.. long story short, the BUS has a brand new
&gt; GEX 1.8 liter engine. The motor has less than 20 miles on it. The BUS also
&gt; has a COMPLETELY new paint job... sort of a light blue body, with a white
&gt; top (from the dew strip gutter thing to the top is white).

Well. GEX has an awful track record. Lots of short cuts and marginal
parts. Hopefully it will last you some time. If you have the ability you
might want to tear down the engine and do some pre-emptive work just in
case there is something fatal lurking.
The paint thing could be good or bad. New paint is nice but it can be used
to cover some horrors in the body.


&gt; However, I am completely missing the gasket for the rear passenger side
&gt; window. To make things a little difficult, all four of the big windows had
&gt; the vent option. The brackets and metal that the vent window sit in are
&gt; completely rusted through... definately unrepairable. So that brings me to
&gt; my first question...

the rear passenger side should not/would not have had a vent because it
gets in the way of the sliding door.
Personally starting from scratch Id replace both rear windows with solid
one piece ones and probably put sliding windows on the middle 2.

&gt;
&gt; !-) Does anyone on here have for sale a vent window for the rear drivers
&gt; side, and the rear passenger side? I have the glass, but I need everything
&gt; else... from the gasket to the hardware to the brackets.

For used parts bustedbus_dot_com is a good start. local junkyards if you can
find a bus in one.

&gt; The next thing is... I'm trying to replace a lot of the items that look
&gt; &quot;old&quot;. I want to replace all the chrome on the car... I'm thinking of
&gt; getting a whole new set of door locks, and the trunk-hatch door handle, as
&gt; well as the commando door handle.

Im not sure what chrome youre talking about. deluxe trim maybe? its
aluminum. the outer window scrapers come with the trim.(also aluminum)
The door locks can be rekeyed unless the chrome is real bad then you could
replace some again bustedbus, junkyards, vwswaps at shows etc...
I have no idea what a commando door is.

&gt; I also want to get replacement hub caps as well. I noticed that prices are
&gt; VERY reasonable.. much cheaper than they are for purchasing items for my
&gt; Pontiacs.

Yes they are cheap but you originals are heavier and made better than
repros and you can get them at swaps for cheap. either really is fine.



&gt; I did find one place on the net.. Wolfsberg West or something... do you guys
&gt; know any other stores that might sell parts for busses?

wolfsburg is good also
oldvolks_dot_com
busdepot_dot_com
aircooled_dot_net
and dont forget local sources.

&gt;
&gt; Also, not sure what exactly is happening.. but I charged the battery and
&gt; hooked it up. The motor doesn't start. Actually.. it doesn't even crank. The
&gt; headlights and HAZARD lights work. The turn signal lights don't.. and when I
&gt; turn on the hazards.. there's some guage over to the left with an R  -  1/2
&gt; -  1/1  and the needle jumps. What exactly is that guage? R???
&gt;
&gt; What are some things I can check? The motor is brand new... but I'm
&gt; wondering if it hasn't been hooked up yet.

r 1/2 1/1   is the gas gauge
I think you should start by going through all of the wiring.
you can find a diagram at www.vintagebus_dot_com
follow the link.

good luck
