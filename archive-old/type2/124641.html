Subject: RE: [T2] How to find TDC to verify Distributor is not 180
  degrees off?

Hey man, I just went through the same thing a few days ago. I see you
have a '74, but I don't think theirs much difference between us. 

Ok, the thing is, the distributor spins at HALF the speed of the fan
with the timing mark. So when you turn the alternator to turn your
engine, the timing mark goes around 360 degrees, but the shaft in the
distributor only goes 180 degrees. 

Now on top of that, the timing mark on the fan spins TWICE per cycle.
The 'first' time the timing mark hits zero, it's the Compression stroke.
Where's it's compressing all the gasoline all nice and tight so it will
blow up good. The 'second' time the timing mark comes around zero, it's
pumping all the burned gasoline back out of the system as exhaust. Then
it repeats, over and over. SO, when your 180 off, your spark is hitting
on the exhaust stroke. So theirs nothing left their to blow up. And if
anything IS left to blow up, it's being pushed out. That's why you get
backfires. So not only does the rotor have to point to #1 when it's at
TDC, but it has to point to #1 when it's at TDC of the Compression
stroke. 

So, even though the distributor only goes in ONE way, you have TWO
chances per cycle to put it in. And you simply chose wrong. It's a 50/50
guess. If you think it's in 180 off, you just take off the distributor,
turn your engine untill the timing mark leaves zero, and comes BACK
around to zero, and re-seat the distributor. 

Here is a quote of the advice from Faster-Laster that really helped me
out to find TDC of the COMPRESSION stroke. 

&lt;quote&gt;
try this. pull off both valve covers. Turn the crank to where the #1
piston is near it's top. You can use a pencil in the spark plug hole to
help make sure. This is TDC. Now look at the valves of #1, while moving
the crank forward/backward about 20 degrees. Do the valve move? if not
look over at #3. If #3 move &amp; #1 don't you are at TDC of the #1
compression stroke. However if the valves on #1 move &amp; #3 remain in
place just rotate the crank 360 degrees.
&lt;/quote&gt;

P.S. I blame the changing weather here in Seattle for my stupidity. Heh
heh  Funny how we both have the same issues in the same week. :)

&gt;&gt;&gt;   My distributor only seems to engage in one position, so I am
wondering how a Type 4 engine could  be 180 degrees off?

Also, how could I verify 1 is TDC without the notch in the distributor?

PS: Why am I so stupid?
