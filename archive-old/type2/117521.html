Subject: Re: [T2] Best place to get a rebuilt longblock

&gt; I am in maryland and need a new longblock to put in my

&gt; area that would be great as well.

unfortunately the only person in Baltimore I would trust my engine to has
since retired,  Peek Automotive in Lanhamn near DC has a pretty good
reputation but they are expensive and I'm not sure if they know type IV
engines.  stay away from GEX, Boston Bob, AVP, and Seattle something or
other (Doc Tim?) seem to have the best references on this list but I
haven't used any of them.
