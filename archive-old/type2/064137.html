Harvey laments:

&gt;      3)  Took the special purchase set over to compare it's wrenches to the
&gt; standard individual purchase wrenches hanging on the wall.  As an example, the
&gt; 3/4&quot; wrench in the set was identical in length, finish, Craftsman, 12 point
&gt; box end, etc to the one for sale individually, priced at $10.00 !!!!  Likewise
&gt; for the 11/16&quot; wrench in the set compared to the individual wrench also priced
&gt; at $10.00  !!!!

This is something that has me scratching at my head.  I figured I 
needed to have a six point 13mm wrench to do my valves.  I didn't like
what the 12 point was doing to the nuts.  $8 for the single wrench or 
$20 for the 8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16.  Not wanting to be played for the
fool I now own eight MORE wrenches that I don't need.  That'll show 
'em....
