In todays Fresno Bee:

66 camper bus, xint cond. must see blah blah blah $5000 209-966-3764  [if 
this number doesn't work, try area code 559]

66 bus, mint cond. w/new engine/tires &amp; more $6600 559-284-4000

70 bus $1200 559-251-0148 or 559-252-9405

72 bus runs/drives great $950  559-224-2277

79 bus, good cond. $2200 obo 559-627-3788

82 Vanagon Clean, refridge, oven [huh?? this is a new one!], camper. $2995 
559-266-4444

+ lots of bugs from 63 to 79 and Ghias from 61 and 78

I know nothing about any of these. You know as much as I do. If these buses 
have spent their life here, they will be almost rust-free.
