Jamie, I have a 78' bus with a 73' Porsche 914/1700cc motor that supposedly
was increased by
200cc's. I have dual Weber 34's.

It would help to know what year bus, motor type, carb
type, etc. These all have pretty serious effects on the
&quot;truth&quot;.


I have a '69 upright 1600sp with a 30/31 pict carb and
set my .009 at stock specs per both Bentley and Muir.
It *does* have that trademark .009 hesitation &quot;out of
the hole&quot;, but otherwise works fine.
