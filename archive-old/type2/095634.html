&gt; Perhaps if a few listees got together and did a group purchase we
&gt; could get a better price from the dealer and do a consolidated
&gt; shipment in a 40' container ( I think 6 Type 2's should fit in a normal
shipping
&gt; container).


I can tell you definitively that this cannot possibly happen, so don't waste
your time.  All vehicles less than 25 years old must be fully certified to
meet EPA emissions and DOT safety standards.  Brazilian and Mexican do not
meet the standards and cannot be certified.  Even on vehicles that can be
certified, the cost is often so high that you'd need to be importing a huge
number of normally-priced cars (or a few cars that were worth a small
fortune, i.e. exotic sports cars) in order for it to pay off. (The auto
manufacturers do it on models that they want to sell in the U.S., but then
they import tens of thousands of that model, so their cost per car is
negligable.)

Although I do have to admit I'd like to get a look at these 6 foot long
busses that can fit six to a 40 foot container ...  They'd be a little
cramped as campers, don't you think?  :-)
