Subject: bus residence

i lived in my westy for over a month this summer while travelling around
the west.  it was great in every way.  the icebox held fresh veggies and
milk and such (new ice every 1.5days or so), and i have a nice (very old)
coleman dual burner stove that will burn unleaded with abandon; it
actually works better than my stove at home for stir-frys and such.

i parked in 24hr grocery stores most of the time, and i never recieved a
complaint.  but, i was moving around pretty often, and i bought stuff
every day as well.  the fold out bed in the back was really comfy, and the
curtains provided privacy.  bathrooms were never a problem; there was
always the store's bathroom for hand and face washing.  i took 2 showers
the whole summer, so that was a non-issue.  of course you may be used to
showering more often (even at home it is rarely more than a thrice weekly
affair for me).

right now i am seriously considering moving out of my house into my bus or
my grandparent's (mine if i can beg well enough ;)  airstream trailer.
all in all, living in the bus was great, and i will definitely be doing it
again.

go for it!
