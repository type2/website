A counterpoint - I tried this stuff on my windshield channel rust (after
wirebrushing 99% of the rust away) and the rust was back in 3 weeks.  Maybe
I did something wrong?

One thing I did wrong was move to Dallas.  In Southern California, I think
you could paint over rust with just about anything and it wouldn't come
back.  :)

Now I use Corroless and am pleased with the results.  It is available from
Eastwood restoration (http://www.eastwoodco_dot_com I believe).  With apologies
to Uncle Jerry, Corroless is WAY better than Extend.
