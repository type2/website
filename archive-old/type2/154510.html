So, who all is on the roster to go to this one?  It's always been a fun show
in the past, and now that I am back in the area I wouldn't miss it for the
world.  I will hopefully be bringing some of the Knoxville contingent with me,
if I can round anyone up.  This is assuming I actually decide to return from
camping (going to Cloudland Canyon today) and re-enter the real world.

I will be there, although I still am not sure whether I'm driving the '69 or
the '84 up there.

So look for the guy in the VW shirt driving the VW.  That shouldn't be too
hard. ;)
