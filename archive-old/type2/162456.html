&gt; The octane question has come up before. It's a given that under some
&gt; conditions you can drop a few degrees of head temps. The question is exactly
&gt; what conditions.
&gt;
&gt; Without an elaborate analysis of each engine, it seems to me the dollar or
&gt; two per fillup difference is still worth it as a &quot;just in case&quot;.

right I feel the cost difference over the life of the engine is cheap
insurance if I get and extra 20k before I need to rebuild.
&gt;
&gt; But pay attention to your bus! When I run super here in CO the Guac actually
&gt; runs worse. The mid-grade is ideal. So that's what I use. When I visited CA
&gt; I threw super in just to see. Ran better than midgrade. So you really need
&gt; to pay attention to what your bus likes and what conditions you're driving
&gt; in.

and sometimes it is different brands even, my bus &quot;Likes&quot; Sunoco and
Texaco and &quot;Hates&quot; Shell and BP.  go figure.
