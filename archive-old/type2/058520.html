Subject: Fruitful obsession

My obsession with Type 2s is bearing fruit. It began last October 17, 
when I passed a Westy on I40 in Flagstaff, Arizona, and saw for the first 
time. It is as though I had never seen VW buses before, though I am old 
enough to have purchased the first baywindow new. Wittgenstein calls this 
aspect blindness. Anyway, I saw and became obsessed. First, I adjusted my 
running route to pass every transporter in the neighborhood. Then I found 
this list, and associated web pages. 

The obsession remained in this mode until July 3, when Michael Wagner 
relayed an ad for a 1976. On reading the ad I called the owner, went out 
at once to see the bus, and bought it for $400.

Since then I have: 

 	- Rubbed out 10,000 rust halos and waxed over the pinholes
 	- Replaced both bumpers
	- Removed the seats and interior panels, given to a good home
	- Built a camper kit out of baltic birch (now 80% complete)
	- Removed the DPD ac (but I am impressed that David Schwarze 
		rehabbed his) (I think some kind of swamp cooler is
		more appropriate for the southwest, and I saved the
		two nasty blowers for this project)
	- Found all the missing tin and an engine seal and installed it
	- Recovered the bucket seats
	- Scrubbed out the accumulation of crap inside
	- Replaced four passenger tires with Yokohama 356s
	- Found a fairly good exhaust system and installed it (after
		breaking an easy-out off in a stud and having to
		take the pipe to a welder to get it out)
	- Installed wiper blades, side mirror, window cranks, hatch latch,
		etc., etc., etc.
	- Hunted the pick-and-pulls for FI parts

As soon as I got the tires and the tin in place, I began to drive the 
bus. But not very far and with little confidence yet. Since I have to 
replace the carbs with the FI, I wasn't willing to replace the fuel lines 
to the carbs (which I figure to be at most 10 years old, and low 
pressure). The price for that decision is that my mind is on engine fire 
whenever I drive. Next week I will swap the FI for the carbs, with all 
new fuel lines, and I hope that will be that. Then I'll just have to 
replace the windscreen (after dealing with the rusty flange) and replace 
the CV boots. After that I can start getting fussy.

The price for all this is tipping over to the high side of two grand -- 
for a bus with a lot of rust on the outside panels and some big dents. 
Clearly, I could have done better. But having to spend the dough and do 
the work has been an education, and that's invaluable.

Giving the bus a name -- Peregrine -- has helped a lot.

I'm on target for an overnight trip on the anniversary of the obsession.
