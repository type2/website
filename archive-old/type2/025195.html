 I know I just missed Friday, but this info has too much camping karma to wait.  I came across a new (to me) sub-culture while searching for something related.  There are a number of people (at least in the USA - maybe in Europe too?) that are into collecting, restoring, and vacationing in vintage travel trailers.  A very interesting site is Vintage Vacations (http://www.vintage-vacations_dot_com/).  Another site for those in Michigan is Tin Can Tourists (http://www.geocities_dot_com/~tctour/).  Looks like there can be some great synergy between VW Bus campers and these groups.

  Two other sites for purchase of such trailers (besides RV Trader) are the Vintage Airstream Club (http://www.airstream_dot_net/) and a new entry: brand-new-made-to-look-like-old  Fifties Trailers (http://www.fiftiestrailers_dot_com/) in British Columbia.
