Subject: Tent guru's please!

I have a &quot;lead&quot; in a tent the owner descibes it as follows

&gt;&gt;I got the tent from someone else who no longer had the bus. He said
&gt;it's for 62-67's.
&gt;
&gt;&gt;One or two footer(adjustable height) poles and one of the &quot;Y&quot; shaped
&gt;corner poles.
&gt;
&gt;&gt;The tent is medium blue with yellow sections. It doesn't have a floor
&gt;but it does have the piece that connects it to the bus (with the rubber
&gt;trim piece and snaps. As far as I can tell from the manual everthing is
&gt;there except for the couple poles. The tent and poles look like new.

Does this sound like a circa 65-67 tent? to you, I am actually looking for
a earlier stlye tent the &quot;awning style&quot; that attaches to the side of the
bus (and poles to front and rear bumper). Tents are usually red and white
or yellow and grey.

So from what little info I have provided does anyone have any thoughts what
the tent might be worth?
