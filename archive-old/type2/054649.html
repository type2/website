Subject: Winnipeg, Mb - list members?

Heya list

Well, I'm about to pull my motor and transmission to por-15 my engine  bay
etc.. as well as perform a few minor repairs.  I do not forsee any problems
but ya just never know - especially considering what a novice I am.

Anyway,  I'm wondering if there are any local list members who I could call
on for assistance should I run into any problems - my bus is a 60 standard
(I know this isn't the vintage list but ..... there are not too many early
busses in Manitoba) and seems quite straightforward.

TIA
jdd 60 std
