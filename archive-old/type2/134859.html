Subject: Re: [T2] Mallory

John said:
 
 Most people do not realize how inaccurate the bosch units are. They assume
their timing light is &quot;supposed&quot; to scatter as much as it does. Only after
timing a Mallory do you realize it's not your timing light that's causing
the erratic spark scatter, its your engine! Many people think their ignition
system &quot;is perfect&quot; even after putting a light on it. The clarity of the
timing marks when triggerring off a Unilite usually eliminates the &quot;is
perfect&quot; comments.

Whoa..... you cannot lump all Bosch distributors in your &quot;Mallory is better than all&quot; 
synopsis.  Unless you are familiar with the 79-83 factory electronic distributors, which I
doubt, then you need to just refer to the Kettering style Bosch distributors.
