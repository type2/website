Subject: Re: [T2] can I paint my bus like this?????

I don't think the Wagner can handle the viscosity you need for auto 
paint. Household spray guns need pretty thin paint, the nozzles clog 
easily. Some of the cheaper guns don't have replaceable nozzles! Clog 
it up and you have to toss the whole thing.

&gt; The Wagner gun is for housepaint and lawn furniture. If you are 
&gt; planning to also use the Wagner for your house and lawn furniture then 
&gt; by all means let 'er rip.
