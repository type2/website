&gt; &gt; You can't fix the gas tank without removing the engine, but you will
want
&gt; to
&gt; &gt; do that as soon as you can. There is a lot of info in the archives on
&gt; this.
&gt; &gt; I don't know if its ok to do this or not, but I would siphon out the old
&gt; gas
&gt; &gt; if I were you. If there is rust (and other crud) you will need to do the
&gt; &gt; tank, but fresh gas must be better than the gas thats in there now.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; In the meanwhile CHANGE ALL THE FUEL LINES! The rubber inside the cloth
&gt; gets
&gt; &gt; brittle and the gas will come out and you don't know it until its too
&gt; late.
&gt; &gt; If you have started it at all you will notice the cloth on the fuel
lines
&gt; is
&gt; &gt; wet..thats gas coming out and you'll have an engine fire! When you
replace
&gt; &gt; the fuel lines (and you didn't do the tank yet) I would put a few fuel
&gt; &gt; filters in a row. Even 4 would be a good idea even if it looks funny.
&gt;
&gt; I would not put more than one between tank and pump as this will create
too
&gt; much load on pump.
&gt; After pump is ok but probably  redundant, be sure they are high pressure
&gt; filters because that system runs up to 40psi and a little $2 in line
filter
&gt; you see on carburated buses will pop!!

&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; &gt; I would definately change the oil too.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; There are probably other precautions too, but I will let others voice
&gt; their
&gt; &gt; opinion too. You can also have a buddy watch the engine as you turn it
&gt; over
&gt; &gt; and it starts to run.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Good luck with the new bus!!

&gt; &gt; &gt; what's up list,
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; I just purchased my first bus ('77 bay) a few days ago and I'm really
&gt; &gt; &gt; anxious to bring her back to life. The problem is she hasn't ran in
half
&gt; a
&gt; &gt; &gt; decade and has been sitting as a lawn decoration ever since. I was
just
&gt; &gt; &gt; curious to know if there are certain things I should do to the gas
tank
&gt; &gt; and
&gt; &gt; &gt; the engine (oil change, etc.) before I crank her up...any help is
&gt; &gt; &gt; grateful...
&gt; &gt; &gt; thanks,
&gt; &gt; &gt; -Aaron
