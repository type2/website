Is this the same thing as a Bowden cable?  I have always thought that a
Bowden cable was a cable that works in both directions (ie push/pull),
like the heater cables, but not like the clutch or throttle cables.  Am
I misguided?

&gt; Boudin tube - I know that a boudin tube is a
&gt; flexible tube to guide a cable.  There are several
&gt; on our buses, a couple for the heater cables, one
&gt; for the clutch cable, for the carb preheat, etc. 
&gt; but really, is it really named after the sausage? 
&gt; or is there a Mr Boudin ou there in it's history?
