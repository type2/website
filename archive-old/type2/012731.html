Amen, preach it brother!! I agree 100% with what Al wrote. You have a problem
if this guy thinks he is smarter than all those engineers that VW paid to
design and build the engine originaly. Tell him you want it as the factory
built it or walk away quickly.
&gt; Justin:
&gt; RUN! Don't walk away from this guy! I think the air doesn't even go through
&gt; the oil cooler properly without the flaps in place. At any rate, it's only
&gt; slightly warmer in Georgia than in Germany, an insignificant number when you
&gt; consider thetempreature of the cylinder heads or the oil.
&gt; Who knows what other pseudo- science he subscribes to. Maybe torque the heads
&gt; twice as  tight so as to be better than the factory? I recently ran into a
&gt; fellow who believed exactly that! I wonde how many studs he's pulled!)
&gt; The air injector pump was a stop gap emissions fix to clean up the exhaust.
&gt; Just burned further in the exhaust. Rendered unnecessary by increased
&gt; precision of the fuel injection, which was introduced in 1975. In other
&gt; words,
&gt; used only in 73 and 74, I believe.
