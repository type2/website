Subject: Can anyone give this guy some advice ?

This is the email I got from   hotchimney_at_hotmail_dot_com  in Vermont

hope you can  help. i got a 73  camper bus witha  1700cc auto
trany//webber
carb single dual butterfly type

it ran before i rebuilt the  motor    /the rings  were shot  on one
side
so i  bought new heads from these assholes who  are no help&gt;
&lt;&lt;www.mofoco_dot_com&gt; and  new barrels new rings  new pistons  and  gasket
kit.they fucked  up my order and  sent me other parts  so i got 1800cc
pistons and barrles  and  2000cc heads  for  my  1700  they siad  it
would
still work??? i asked  other vw  folks they siad  it would  also.

i rebuilt  it all to specs  and torks   i have  like  5 service
maunals. i
didnt split  the case&lt; ilooked at the cams  they look fine  all the
rods
were fine and cases. i looked  at the oil pump  and  filled it with oil
and
put it back
i  set all the valves and  triple checked them after  hand spining the
motor.  it  seem  a little  tight  /with the plugs  out / i thought it
was
because  of the new parts. i put  it back in the body  hooked
evertihgn
back up got a new starter/
i try priming the oil opump  by starting  with the plugs  out  for a
few
min. then  i put  the plugs  in / oil light did  got out/
i had  it running  for a min then it stalled.  seem tight like  it
would
only run with a high idle &lt; i had  the choke dis armed  other wise  it
would mees  up  when i stalled&gt;  it  stalled  a few times  and  i
tryed  to
hand spin  it ,it would not  turn  it was  tight ??? hummm??

so i started  again.  it  ran  and  stalled again.  i looked in the
under
the back and  i saw oil dripping  .  so  i stopped  not sure  where it
was
leaking  becasue  it went all over  might have been the filter ?who the
hell
knows.

this  was  in the spring  time ive been so busy  i haven made time  for
it
i want to pull the motor   and  look inside soon.

i spent  like $800  opn parts   so  im  really dis appointed  ive
learned
alot  but i want to drive it  not  wokr on it all summer.
tell me what u think   if want  more info  ill write u back    thanks
man
jason
