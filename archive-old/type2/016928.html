&gt; and the oil light blinks, a minute later, on and off again, drove home slowly,
&gt; oil light didnt come on again, what madness is this?
&gt; 
&gt; I'll be re-checking the oil-level tommorow, it may be lowish. Can this be
&gt; related to corners or hills? The oil light always comes on at first click on
&gt; the ignition so its not faulty wiring.
Biscuitman(?):
You didn't mention where you live or how cold is COLD. I had that
problem in December with my diesel vandragon when it dipped to -5F and
colder. Seems somebody hadn't taken out the 20w-50 summer oil (we did
have an unseasonably mild fall). Well,it seems the heavy oil doesn't
return to the sump as fast as it normally does and the pump pumps air.
About a mile of driving at real low rpms in 2nd gear would warm it up
enough to keep the lite off. Changing to 5w-20 solved the problem. It's
a real tribute to my battery that it started at all with that molasses
in there. 
So, if you have thick oil, and maybe not quite enough of it, that could
be your answer.
