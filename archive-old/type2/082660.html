Subject: '68-71 style bumper beading???????

Howdy all,

Took off my front bumper, and disassembled it, looks
great, except for the &quot;beading&quot; or seal between the
main bumper and the end pieces.  Does anyone know
where to get these, and/or what the part # is?  If
they are not available, what have others done to
combat this?  

Thanks
