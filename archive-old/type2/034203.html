Subject: Re: Auto in the bus

&gt; for).  To install the auto trans, you need the torque converter drive
&gt; plate, which in the US only came for the T4 crank, so installation on a T1
&gt; engine is &quot;right out&quot;.  Maybe European models came with the T1 engine and
&gt; an auto trans... (anyone?)  is there a T1 auto trans drive plate?  would
&gt; an autostick drive plate work?  (I strongly doubt it!)

On a different note, would a Type3 transmission fit in a bus (and would it
be able to handle all the extra weight, and are the shift points
appropriate?) If so, it's a good match for the Type1 engine.

There's also the possibility of getting a custom drive plate to mate the
Type1 engine to the Type4 tranny.  The guys at KEP (www.kennedyeng_dot_com)
would probably be the ones to ask about that...
