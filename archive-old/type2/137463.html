Subject: Don, I just don't get it

Don,

I don't get it. You seem to wake up every morning and the first thing 
you do is post to the list something like &quot;rats got into my house 
overnight and bit my toes off. There goes my career as a tightrope 
walker.&quot;

And we all pitch in with suggestions about how to kill the rats, and 
how to keep them out of your house, and how there have been toeless 
tightrope walkers.

And then you get back to us with, well they weren't really rats, they 
were more like dust bunnies. And my toes are here, but they've got 
fungus in the nails. And I really don't want to be a tightrope walker.

All this reminds me of Rosie Perez in &quot;White Men Can't Jump:&quot; &quot;Just 
because I say I'm thirsty, it doesn't mean I want you to get me a drink 
of water.&quot;

Are you just venting? How do you want me (and others) to respond?

Signed,

Frustrated in San Diego
