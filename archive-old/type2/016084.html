Terry,

What is the MAX PSI that these tires will take?  If they go up to 50 PSI,
then they are indeed the tires you want... what air pressure did you put in
front and rear?

He put 'em on yesterday afternoon.  Driving Maureen home, the tires don't
feel any different from the crappy worn-out passenger tires originally on
there.  I look at them when I get home.  ONE ply sidewall.  1400 lb load
max.  ARRGHHH!!

I'm royally PO'ed.  Look up the tire at Tirerack.  Yep, it's classified as a
light truck tire all right.  Jeez.  Who makes up these classifications?

Another $50 would have got me some stiff-sidewall tires worthy of the name
&quot;truck tire&quot;.

Moral:  accept no substitutes.  Your local dealer MAY know wherein he
speaks...but you can't count on it.  Go with this list's opinion on tires.
