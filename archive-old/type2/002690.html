To me in order most likely places on a T4 to leak oil would be:

valve covers, pushrod tubes, somewhere involving the oil cooler or filter,
particularly the cooler to flange junction.

Of course all the other suggestions are likely as well but these would be my
top picks.  It may not have been mentioned but the PCV system can have leaks
as well.
