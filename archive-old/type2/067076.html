&gt; &gt; What are the load ratings for older busses, and older single and crew
&gt; &gt; cabs in particular?
The 71 Transporter brochure I have in front of me has these specs:

Weight in LBS (Station Wagon, 7 Seater)
Unladen weight 2,811; Payload 1962; Gross weight 4773.

The Kombi:  A station wagon that seats 5.  This is our basic model. 
Optional seating for up to 9 available.  Payload 2,171.  Ask your VW
dealer for more information.  (how typical!)

Overall dimensions (in inches)
Length                  174.0
Width                   69.5
Height                  77.0
Ground Clearance (unladen)      7.3
Side door clear width   41.7
Side door clear height  48.2
Rear door clear width   48.4
Rear door clear height  28.7
Luggage compartment     35.0 cu. ft. (is this just over the engine????)

This is a cool brochure for 71 (with a 69ish looking bus on the
cover...did European busses keep the 5 bolt rims and rounder hub caps
into 1971?  Mine has the 4 bolt, late bug hub caps.).  It has the bus on
the cover and &quot;It's a station wagon more or less.&quot; on the cover, and
proceeds to compare the bus to an American station wagon...with a pile
of radiators, chrome bumpers, antifreeze, and lovely wood-sided fenders.
They even show a troup of Girl Scouts riding somewhere....  Very cool.

Did this help at all??????
