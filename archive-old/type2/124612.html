Subject: Re: [T2] Middle Bench mounts

The original equipment was a &quot;toggle&quot; bolt type thing. The  &quot;head&quot; is
rectangular and it slides into some keyholes that are in the floor, and then
the threads stick up like a stud. They slide in and then you turn them
around so they won't pull out. These go through the seat tube and then the
nut tightens it down. If you just have standard bolts they won't work Sorry
no pics.
