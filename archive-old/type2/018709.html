I own two FI buses, both run flawlessly and have for years. My '77 FI
2.0L has run for 268,000 miles with only 1 FI problem (clogged injector
and I have the paperwork) and my '79 FI 2.0L has 155,000 KM on it and
has had NO FI problems in it's 20 year life (documented).._dot_can a carb
say that?

I think the Bosch L-Jetronic system is great and I stand behind it..
