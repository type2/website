&gt; While there might be truth to some of this...there is no
&gt; doubt that the
&gt; manufacturers use different processing and percentage of
&gt; inert ingredients
&gt; that can make one brand of 30 weight different from
&gt; another brand. As far as
&gt; that is concerned, I know they are different and as long
&gt; as they meet the
&gt; certified guidelines they can put whatever they want in
&gt; it. 
wel, yes, of course, buuuuuuuuut! any inference that ANY
oil from one of the major brands could damage your vehicle
is a load of crap! The thinnest viscosity dino juice or
even some wierd combination of dino and synth from twelve
different companies will DO ABSOLUTELY NO DAMAGE!!!!!!

All oil will lubricate your engine!(in an emergency even
canola oil if you need to add something to get home in an
emergency, just change out and install fresh automotive oil
when you get home. I've known people who have used palm
oil, canola oil, eaven heard something about using animal
fat...again in extreme emergency!)
 so switching a bit here and there will not harm...evn
changing over to different brands or viscosities for your
environment...those of you in the cccold and hot areas have
to do seasonal changes, where here in CA we just use 20/50
year round.
unless it's freshly rebuilt, than I still use non detergent
30 wt for first couple changes.
