Subject: Re: [T2] Replacement Panels

http://www.bustedbus_dot_com/ has them. Well, they don't
have the lower part, that I know of. They do have the
entire corner, vent and all, I think. It was around
$200 last time I checked. In frustration, I finally
just had the bodyman sandblast all the rust out of my
battery area and weld in a new battery tray. Trust me,
the idea of having that whole panel replaced crossed
my mind more than once. Good luck.

&gt; Who is the best to buy from?  I don't want to order
&gt; blind and end up with a 
&gt; panel made of old beer cans.
