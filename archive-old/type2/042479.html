&gt; I was wondering if anyone could help me out. I'm having a heck of a
&gt; time finding someone who will insure me for my 79 Westfalia. I have
&gt; given them terms like type II, Westfalia, Campmobile, camper, but
&gt; they are unable to insure it. Can anyone tell me who they are insured
&gt; with?
&gt; 

i have full coverage on my 74 westy w/ allstate. based on the VIN, they were
able to come up with the model name (campmobile) in their database. i've
stuck with them over the years because i've always gotten good service when
resolving claims.

as a fellow westy owner, you'll also be interested to know that they have a
motor assistance club with a special plan for RV owners like yerself. i
don't think you even have to be insured through them to join, and it's
cheaper than AAA.

try the web for other insurance options, but need i say: caveat emptor. you
may find a good deal, but it's not until you have to file a claim that you
find out the real cost of insurance.

good luck.
