Subject: Re: [T2] Gathering group to help engine drop  (Troy's bus)

Here is the key issue's in using JB weld---

Make SURE the are is ultra clean---

Make sure the area is scuffed with 80 grit sandpaper or something to
allow the JB to bond good to---

And this is the most important----

Allow the stuff to thoroughly set up before firing the engine up--

Apply it, walk away from it for 24 hour's.

It works great-----pretty tough stuff .


Later,


Terry

While this is on a T1 engine in a beetle, when I pulled it a few months
ago the cam plug was completely sealed w/ sealant of some sort. It
appears to have completely stopped the leaking that was apparently going
on before this &quot;repair&quot;. I would say for a temporary fix it works, but
you would always have that nagging feeling in your brain that you have
to fix it correctly in the future. 
JB Weld until he has the time to tear it down - like post-baby delivery? 
That is only my suggestion - I have never actually used JB Weld for
anything. I keep waiting for a chance... 
Well OK maybe it was really a question... 
Would JB work for this application (cam plug)? Chris M. &lt;Busbodger -
