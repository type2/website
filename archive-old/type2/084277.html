Subject: 1973 campmobile for sale in toronto

hi

i regretfully have to sell my 1973 campmobile. her name is ursula. she
has dual carbs, stove, sink, fridge, kitchen table, bench in back which
converts to a bed, intact tent/roof, and gas heater, though the gas
heater needs a wire fixed. her exterior is white (well, off white now)
with a red, orange, and yellow racing stripe around her. her interior is
circa 1973 with the goldie, orangie bench overing and curtains.

if you know anyone who would love her, please have them call or e-mail
me.
i'm asking $2000.00, but i'm also open for offers.

thanks
