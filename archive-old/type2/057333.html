Here is my problem (solution to solve). I have a 1971 Westfalia that I will be
installing a fattened (hi-performance) Type IV motor into in the future. I
know I will have to fatten up (hi-performance) the transmission to match. (The
engine will probably be a 2200cc - 2300cc). My reasons for the performance
motor is the extra camping gear weight, and being able to pull hills on
Interstates and State Roads, while pushing the un-aerodynamic box. I am also
looking at towing a small trailer (chopped up old bus) and possibly a future
914 autocrosser.

What is the best transmission that will go in (rather easily) my 1971
Westfalia. And that the Type IV motor will bolt up too ??? What years did it
come in (bus years) and how can I identify it if it is lying on the ground in
a junkyard ????

Any other advice, comments, suggestions, or even a light flaming will be
appreciated.
