If you are talking about the outside of the manifold (away from the engine),
that is the brake booster line.  I had the same problem with
non-availability but the dealer found a part for me which was virtually
identical and fits perfectly.  I think it was for a Golf.  If I can find the
part # I will post it.
Now, if anyone knows a source for the boots which connect the air cleaner
manifold to the idle air intake on top of the LH carb, I'd love to hear from
you.

&gt; I am trying to find a rubber boot that attaches below the carb, on the
&gt; intake manifold to a small steel line.
&gt; It is on the left and right carb of a '74  1800cc
&gt; The number on it is   021-129-637-C
