        Just found out that the '99 Bug-In in Minnesota is Sunday June
13th, 1999.  It's held at West Side (VW) Motors, 1820 Quentin Ave.  St.
Louis Park, MN 55414 Phone#:612 377 4100

        I went last year &amp; had alot of fun.  All VW's are there not just
bugs.  Last year 2 bay buses were for sale.  If anyone is planning on
going, send me an email &amp; hopefully we can meet up.
