     15 min. is not very long, and it's fairly cold out at 35. When I
left WI and it was zero, mine wasn't coming much above 130 even after
driving for hours, although I'm using synoil, which keeps the oil temps
significantly lower. 
     On the leak -- I did my own, didn't weld the nut, and used a copper
gasket on each side, and it still leaked. I finally put some RTV copper
silicone goo on the threads (carefully you don't get it on the sender
itself, and fixed the leak.
