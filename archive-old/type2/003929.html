&gt;For reasons too embarrassing to explain, I need to find an &quot;adventurous&quot;
&gt;mechanic in the DC area to set up my FI, which is no longer stock on my
&gt;MSHP engine which is not stock, either... Have any of you around DC got
&gt;any recommendations?


Steve is too modest, I'll explain.  How about a '77 era wiring harness
installed in an '80 CA Vanagon, running a '78 computer (no full throttle
switch), with a points distributor, on a MS Stage 2 (ackkk, evil) engine.

On a total aside having tuned this thing using the CA O2 sensor resident
(and new) in the exhaust I'd like comments.  The beast indicated a slightly
rich running, showing 0.800 V or so on the sensor up till about 2600 rpm at
which time it would dive lean, way lean to 0.200 or even 0 volts.  Cranking
the flapper arm the appropriate direction yielded even richer at idle maybe
0.850 going to 0.900 or so by 1500 rpm, then a sligh leaning around 2600 but
after that always staying rich through 4500 or so (indicated 0.750 or more)
through the revs, including under load on the highway.  Oddly off throttle
sometimes it would drop lean (is there some sort of shut idle shut off
sensing in the '78 ECU, or Steve may also have a decel valve problem) but
instantaneously would return to slight rich when you brushed the accelerator
and put it back under load.  To me this all seems &quot;safe&quot; to run cool at
least assuming it doesn't foul the big ole CA cat converter.  However some
odd things, frankly it was never ever going to indicate leaner than the .750
or so, and the transition when moving the flapper index was very
instantaneous, up to a click it would still go lean (although it
transitioned from 2600 - 3000 rpm with increasing adjustement) above a
certain click, it stayed rich.  Going the other way lowered the lean time
but never really decreased the idle O2 sensor reading.  Furthermore
adjusting the bypass idle mixture screw had little or no effect.  Might have
been able to lean idle out .250 volts or so no more.

However we did not try reading with more than one meter and I've always sort
of questioned how well grounded the sensors are some times, even though it
is in contact with the exhaust.

Steve and I both seek comments or suggestions.

On the other hand, Steve really seeks only someone who doesn't feel the need
to cover their ass.  Most VW mechanics would have no idea this isn't simply
a federal model Vanagon except for the unused throttle switch connectors,
and those could even be connected, it's just that I made them too short, and
since they have no function on a '78 brain why hook them up.  This also
raises the question, would the spare '77 brain I have be more appropriate,
even though enrichment at full throttle seems no real issue.  How the hell
does the '78 ECU sense full throttle anyway??
