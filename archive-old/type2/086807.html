EVEN WITH RAMPS!  USE JACK STANDS!

sorry for yelling but I don't want to have to sell your bus because you
are no longer with us.

&gt; I use a set of ramps to pull my engine. It gives me tons of room to pull 
&gt; my engine .  I have a cart I put the engine on and when I am ready to 
&gt; lift the motor into place I slid the jack  under  the cart. I then lift 
&gt; engine and cart with no problem. If your bus is not running jack up one 
&gt; side of the bus and slide the ramp under the tire and then do the other 
&gt; side the same way. I may have a picture of my bus up on the ramps in the 
&gt; garage. Let  me look around and I'll post  you a link.

&gt; &gt;&gt;--I wouldn't use the engine as a jack point, the bus should 
&gt; &gt;&gt;be jacked up and carry the engine with it, not vice versa. 
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Come to think of it, when I removed the previous engine, I didn't actually
&gt; &gt;jack the bus up, I just lowered the motor and (after pulling the single carb off)
&gt; &gt;pushed the bus out of the shop (I may have had to lift a little to clear the intake,
&gt; &gt;I can't remember...)   
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;For installation, I thought I'd jack the bus up a little to give me some more room to work.  
&gt; &gt;I wasn't sure if the bus needed to be jacked up evenly from a center point.  From the
&gt; &gt;responses I'm getting, it sounds like I should jack up 1 side, insert the jack-stand and
&gt; &gt;then do the other side.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Thanks,
&gt; &gt;
