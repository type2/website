I'm looking for tires for FreeBird because the PO put passenger tires on it
not knowing any better. I have been looking at the Michelins MXT (205/75-14)
vs Yokohama Y370 (195/75-14) tires.
The Yokohamas have a higher load range (D) than the Michelins and have a
more aggressive tread pattern. Since I live in a &quot;all season&quot; area, I need a
more aggressive tread pattern like the Yokohamas. One of the other major
items is costs. There again, the Yokohamas are less money making them more
cost agreeable for me.

In a nutshell:
Michelin MXT (205/75-14) Sears $110/ea,
                                      Costco $69/ea.
Yokohama Y370(D)(195/75-14)Tire Rack delivered price $71/ea,      Sears
matching and beating price $66/ea.

The Yokohamas win hands down. Less costs, higher load rating, better tread
for all season driving. Plus many list members testify
to their quality.

I placed my order with Sears (5ea Yokohama Y370 (D)) today.
