Subject: Re: [T2] brake disc screw

&gt; Richard let me know that this screw is M8 &amp; 20mm
&gt; long (thanks Richard).
&gt; Now, does anyone happen to have the part number for
&gt; these things or happen
&gt; to know where I can get a few?

Do you mean the screw that attaches the disc to the
wheel? So is partnr 14 on the picture below?

If so then the actual partnr is:

  N 014 779 1 &quot;SCREW, CHEESE HD. M 8x20&quot;

The number doesn't start with the usual '211' because
it is a multi purpose part (so it starts with an 'N').
Quite a regular thing which you might also be able to
get at your local hardware store. But then I don't
know if there are any differences in metalstrength.
The description above is the only thing that is
mentioned on the microfiche.
