&gt; just curious.. what's involved (cost/mechanics) in switching to
&gt; hydraulic lifters?  I have a 76 2.0 FI.

There are two schools of thought on this--replace the camshaft, lifters and
pushrods in your engine with hydraulic ones, and just replace the lifters.
I'll not put a dog into that fight; here are prices from Bus Depot's
website:

Hydraulic lifters, set of 8 $79.60 ($9.95 each)
Hydraulic pushrods, set of 8 $119.60 ($14.95 each)
Hydraulic camshaft, set of 1 $139.95

If you change just the lifters (I just went downstairs and confirmed that a
mechanic's magnet can pull the Type 4 lifter out of the case from the
cylinder side, which means you don't have to split the case like you do on a
Type 1) $79.60 will get you into hydraulics--not too shabby. If you're an
everything man, $349.15 just for the hydraulic lifter system. Add to that an
engine pull and overhaul, because it's dumb to take the engine completely
apart to change the camshaft and not overhaul it while a golden opportunity
is staring you in the face.
