Sad but true.  The deal with disposable bottles is that there is no
provision to prevent overfilling of the bottle.  If you know how to do it,
it can be done quite safely, but the manufacturer cannot count on all
refillers to know what they are doing.  The result is products covered
with warning labels which nobody pays attention to anyway.  I have a heck
of a time introducing students to lab work because there are no warning
labels there so they automatically think everything is nice and safe.

&gt; So, I'm guessing that the chance of an overfilled disposable  propane
&gt; cylinder exploding is pretty remote.... if it does fail, either the cylinder
&gt; valve will leak and stink of propane...or the built-in pressure relief valve
&gt; will open up and it will stink and you can toss it.

Assuming that the overfilled bottle is placed in a vehicle in summer, what
will happen is not an explosion at all.  The rupture disc will fail and
liquid propane will spray out and immediately vaporize.  Since the rupture
disc is normally on the bottom of the container, the entire contents of
the container will be expelled as liquid.

The smell will be rather overwhelming, and If the propane finds
an ignition source, spectators will be treated to an explosion of
the sort normally found in action movies.

Not a problem if you know what you are doing, but could be a big problem
if somebody doesn't know.
