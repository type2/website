Subject: Re: [T2] 34pict3 on a single port

Hi Eric,

No, they won't swap.  The 30 and 34 numbers are the diameters of the 
intakes. Also the spacing of the studs is different.

There is an adapter for a Pict 30/31 to a dual port but I have looked at 
it and it doesn't look as though it would work in reverse. The stud 
threading does not go all the way through so the studs cannot be reversed. 
Even if they could, were the adapter in place does not then look as though 
there would enough clearance for the throttle linkage to then work 
properly.

There may be an adapter for you purpose but I am not aware of it. Maybe 
someone else on the list is.

Cheers,

Arathorn
