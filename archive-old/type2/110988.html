Right.  But where does the oil *return* to?   
(Hence, you need to tap *something* and you need some sort of hose 
somewhere) Just trying to clarify, as &quot;no hoses&quot; sounded a bit
impossible.

My 71 Double port engine has two threaded plugs on the forward oil
gallery, I guess you'd use one of these. The pump might be for Dune Buggy
or racing applications.
These things are always a mystery to me .................... the only
stock VW I've ever owned was a 56? last one with the split rear window on
a bug. A true value at $250.00. It just ran and ran for six years and
then I became wealthy and replaced it with a new Eldorado Cadillac that
just broke and broke and broke.
