    It's easier some places than others. If you have any kind of a job you
can make it easy. If you plan to stay in one area find a mail box,
preferably a private company with just a number instead of a P.O. box #
because it will look like an apartment number in an address and make it
possible to get things like a library card and if needed public assistance.
I posted ads on buliten boards at community centers and health food stores
for a drive way space to live in, they can be had for $50 to $200 a month in
my area, or if you're handy work trade is often possible. Many let you have
bathroom access and some a phone. These are often short lived so hang onto
the mail box even if you find a good situation. If you can't find a good
situation or can't afford it avoid camping in residential areas as it just
creates problems. go to the industrial section of town and find a nice dead
section. Preferably with a fast food place or major store near by for
bathroom facilities. If  being homeless is illegal in your area you will
need to make sure all lights in your camper cant be seen from the out side
or turn them off at dark. If someone else is camping near by and making lots
of noise,mess, or trouble LEAVE. When the cops come they wont be likely to
ignore you. In a hard spot for short term or when traveling walmart will
allow you to camp if you buy something from them. Talk to other homeless
people to find out where the food is. There are often choice grocery store
dumpsters(only eat the bread and veggies of course), bakeries getting rid of
the days left overs, and sometimes churches with a decent food box(sometimes
more BS than its worth) find out if food not bombs operates in your area,
they often prepare hot hot vegan or vegitarian meals free for those in need.
If you cant make it in your area move to eugene oregon, their aren't many
jobs right now but I lived happily and healthy as described in eugene
working only 1-2 days a week until we decided to get real jobs, a house,
etc. In some ways I even miss it.  Or if you have money available travel the
country and see the sights. Try to think of it as an adventure rather than a
hardship.
