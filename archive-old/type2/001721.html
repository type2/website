Esteemed listees,

1) In lieu of buying new Baltic birch paneling, and cutting to size (w/
crossed fingers, of course), I spent the weekend pulling, sanding, staining
and coating (polycrylic) me olde panels.  They look incredible!  Considering
the relatively light demand on time and effort, I recommend this to anyone
who's tired of looking at faded panels yet unwilling to cut new wood.

2) In the process detailed ad nauseum above, I discovered that I need
several of the little black clip thingys - but don't know where to find
them/how much $$.  I tried the Depot, of course, but wasn't really sure on a
keyword - and it didn't show on the Interior page... certainly no part #.
Would someone be so kind as to forward me the details?  Also - every panel
but the back (back hatch) was three-ply birch - but the back panel was
pressboard?  What's that all about?  Is that original, or did the PO pull
one?

3)  Continuing the rebuild/resto saga: my wife, 11-m/o daughter and I went
to our first drive-in movie together in the Westy!  Crappy movies -
memorable experience.  We were the benefactors of many compliments -
bringing an old car to an old venue!  (Of course, the teens unanimously
thought it was a &quot;shagmobile!&quot;)  As the drive-in is forty miles from our
home, it was the longest round-trip taken in the Bus since the rebuild...
I'm slowly (but nervously) building confidence in her mechanical state.
 Oh - and I passed a semi - going uphill!!

Cheers and good day to all!
