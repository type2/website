&gt; Wow, thanks for the advice.  I'll take your suggested route.  I'll see how this old panel bus does on those hills.  Maybe stop and take a few pictures of it against the fall colors.

well some more detail on that route. others who know my chime in.

get out of New York best way you can.

cross NJ on I-78 there are few moderate hills in Western NJ will be able
to find out how the bus is doing.  I would get gas before crossing the
Delaware river, I prefer getting gas in NJ, think it might be a little
cheaper too.  the drop down to the river is impressive and this is fairly
near where George crossed on Christmas eve.

going East through Eastern PA it is hard to realize your only about 50
miles from Philadelphia, also when passing Allentown you are not too
far from the Bus Depot so if you need something he is nearby.

East of Harrisburg PA you will merge with I-81 be carefull in this are
there is a lot of road construction and traffic can be horrendous, stay on
81 from that point it is a pleasant drive through some orchards and
foothills, wave I'm South of there on I-83.  

As soon as you cross into Maryland you will run into the Hagerstown area,
(theres a good VW dealer that actually has a few air cooled parts in
Hagerstown too!)  South of town you will reach I-70, head West.
Hagerstown is a good place to stock up and there is a small motel right on
the Maryland Penn line that is reasonable, has a great greasy spoon next
door, and if close to dark I would call it a night (used to be called the
Mason-Dixon but I think the name was recently changed, easy to find, get
off at first exit in MD, head west on State line road it is the first
place West of I-81)

now comes the hills, take your time as you come onto I-70 there is a pull
through some low hills between ranges, watch the cops in here, when you
get to Hancock (MD is only a little more than a mile wide here) take the
route to Cumberland/Frostburg I-68, here's where the one big hill begins,
it is a several mile pull up to Sideling ridge, this is one of the lower
crossings of the Appalachin ridge chain.  check your brakes too.  after
this it is rolling hills between mountains to Cumberland, last place to
gas up, and get some grub before the haul to dang near Pittsburgh.  take
it easy the road is very poorly designed here and it is easy to get
confused. there is a short grade out of town that is deceptivly steeper
than it looks.

enjoy into Morgantown, then you get to decide North Via I-79 and West on
I-70 or South on I-79 &amp; I-64.  I usually take the Northern route, flater
and more help along the way, but the Southern Route avoids the Ohio
Turnpike.. 

on the Northern Route you head up a valley to almost Pittsburgh, in
Washington PA, There are a couple nice motels in Washington, I'm partial
to the Knights inn there

West on I-70 you have a few hills near Wheeling and then it is pretty much
flat level (windy) run across I-70 to St Louis.

my suggestion is to take 3 days (assuming no problems) and stop in
Hagerstown and Washington.... bewary of the apparent shorter route on the
map by taking the Pa turnpike West from Harrisburg...there are some killer
hills on that route, I avoid it like the plague myself, drop down into MD
with a VW you will make better time and enjoy yourself more too

Happy Motoring

Bob
