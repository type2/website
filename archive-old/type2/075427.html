Subject: Re: [T2] uneasy about brakes...

Wow. Thanks volks, for the excellent leads and advice
on my low brake pedal problem. I hope to have the time
and weather to allow me to sort it out this weekend. I
fear it will become a full-tilt brake job before it's
over, but so be it...

BTW, being a knucklehead-level mechanic, i always
first consult bentley and muir, but the list's &quot;real
world&quot; experience makes the difference and gives me
the courage to bust some knuckles.
