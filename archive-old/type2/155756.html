Subject: Re: [T2] Yet another Roadtrip!

&gt; I have to say that playing around with the VW's as a hobby is a fine
&gt; thing to do--and is a bunch of fun.
&gt;
&gt; But to depend on one for reliable transportation on a daily basis is
&gt; much like keeping that Indian ( Royal) Enfield on the road for your
&gt; daily driver.
&gt;

I must disagree. A well maintained ACVW is just as reliable as a modern
vehicle.

Note the &quot;well maintained&quot; part.

Yes, you'll have to do more to keep up the maintenance. But the maintenance
is way cheaper, even if you take it to a shop. How much did you pay for your
last 60k service?

Volvos went to poop when Ford bought 'em. Same with Saabs when GM bought
them. Jag quality went up, but when you're already at the bottom of the
pile, there aren't many other places to go... ;-)  VW/Audi's quality has
been crap for a decade now. Mostly from electronics. Not that I'm interested
in buying anything from a company who allows their legal eagles to target
hobbyists.

I have my doubts about Porsche too. I drove a brand new Cayenne 2 weeks ago
(a co-worker's). I was underwhelmed. The interior is all plastic except for
the leather trim and seats. The throttle is sloppy and unresponsive for the
first 2 inches of travel. Handling was on par with any other mid-sized SUV.
It had power, but so do many others. It is about as far from a Porsche as
they could possibly have gotten without rebadging a Cadillac.
