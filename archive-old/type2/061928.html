Subject: Re: on sale at JCW

Thanks for the info, Bill.  I received my VW JCW mini catalog last night.
The only sale item that caught my attention was the 1600cc crank gear puller
at $47--that's the cheapest I've seen it anywhere (RMMW want's $90 for one).
Prices were good till sometime in October.  Email me if you need the catalog
# to place an order--my catalog is at home in my err...reading room.
