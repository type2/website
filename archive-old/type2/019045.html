You can use a counter sink to ream the inside of the ends of
the wrist pins. Use the lightest one with the heavuest
piston and keep them together after your done.

&gt;         Hey, gang. I'm in the throes of my first rebuild (2.0 L) and the
&gt; pistons (not to mention a lot of other stuff) came from two parts motors.
&gt; My original pistons are 1800, and I felt like bumping everything up, hence
&gt; the new ones. Much to my chagrin, I weighed them and got the following
&gt; results, in grams:
&gt; 
&gt; 458
&gt; 462
&gt; 481
&gt; 485
