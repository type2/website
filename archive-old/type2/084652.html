Subject: Question about parking lights

As long as I've had my bus, I still run into things I don't understand.

Today I had the rapid-blinker noise that indicates a burnt-out bulb.  The 
right front parking light (orange, roughly-square high-mounted one for 
73-79 busses) had not one but two bulbs under the lens cover.  The large 
one was an 1157 with two filaments, which I understand.  The small one had 
no markings on it but it was also burnt out.  I bought all new bulbs and 
installed them (for the small one, I got the package marked &quot;indicator 
bulbs&quot; that had the highest numerical identifier) and then tested out the 
lights.

It appears that the small light works in unison with the weaker(for lack of 
a better term) filament on the 1157.  That is, they both go on when the 
parking lights are on and both go off when the parking lights are off.  The 
blinker of course only affects the stronger filament of the 1157.

I guess my question is this:  Why is the small bulb even there?  It seems 
to never be on by itself and therefore redundant.  Someone please tell me, 
I'm dying of curiosity!
