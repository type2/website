Speaking of praising the members of this great list, last week Raoul Simon
responded to my SOS on behalf of a friend whose Westy had broken down in
Oaxaca, Mexico. Mechanics had already spent 3 weeks trying to properly refit
the fuel injection parts, but without success.

Raoul knows people who know people in Oaxaca, hence set into motion a chain
of e-mails and calls. Within 24 hours, he provided me with the name and
location of a trustworthy and influential person for local guidance, info
that got then forwarded to the distressed traveler.

I meant to wait a little bit longer to post about this, hoping to first get
some info on whether the bus actually got fixed, but, in the end, the actual
outcome is irrelevant. What matters is that Raoul went out of his way to
maximize the probability of success.

And the beauty of it all: I don't know Raoul and he doesn't know me. I
didn't even know where Oaxaca was before I looked at a map.
