&gt; &gt;  Matt, these are very interesting numbers and has me rethinking 
&gt; &gt;components to use. I have an e-mail in to Vintage Air, I C E and 
&gt; &gt;Cool (manufacturer in Texas) to see what there answers will be to 
&gt; &gt;numbers you posted, being they all claim there Sanden only use 1 
&gt; 1/2 HP.
&gt; 
&gt; It did on my bus, and therefore it will only produce as many BTUs 
&gt; as Matt listed in his last post (something south of 5,000).  I had 
&gt; my bus on the dyno and observed the 1.5hp power loss from the 
&gt; Sanden compressor so I know it's true (okay, it may have peaked at 
&gt; 2hp).  As Matt correctly asserts, you can't get something for 
&gt; nothing.

I would love to have an effective AC on my bus, (just came in, 96in the
shade and my bus wasn't parked in the shade)

&gt; much since it's just a heat exchanger.  Under what conditions are 
&gt; they claiming 16,000 BTU?  I would argue that with the expansion 
&gt; exchanger itself!  Don't be misled.
&gt; 
&gt; Another reference point - I have a 5,000 BTU window unit air 
&gt; conditioner that we took with us to BNNTA a couple of years ago in 

&gt; down to the point where I was shivering.  I can guarantee a couple 
&gt; of things - #1, you will NOT get 32,000 BTUs out of the in-bus A/C 
&gt; system that spurred this discussion (and thus their advertising is 
&gt; a bit misleading) and #2, if you DID get 32,000 BTUs out of it, 
&gt; the interior temperature of the bus would be at 40 degrees within 
&gt; a minute or two of turning it on.  If you doubt this, go to Home 

&gt; unit they have.  It will be rated in the neighborhood of 18,000 
&gt; BTUs.  Turn it on high and stand in front of it for a few minutes, 
&gt; then close your eyes and picture this much A/C in your bus.  It is 
&gt; way more than you will ever have and it's barely half of 36,000 
&gt; BTUs.

I have one of these and it cools 750sq foot area and never breaks a sweat.

FWIW, a full size city transit bus only has 96,000btu, or about 3 times
what they claim for a VW bus...and they haul around 40-60+ people with the
door constantly opening and closing, it's a wonder they cool at all but
they can handle the load most of the time.


&gt; &gt;Speaking of A C h p, in my wifes new PT crusier, when you floor 
&gt; it the A C
&gt; &gt;compressor turns off till you let back up on the gas pedal! I 
&gt; guess they
&gt; &gt;know you need the extra ponies to pass with.

considering the size of bus motors that might not be such a bad idea.
still with that HPBus drop floor I don't know where I would put all the
components, running out of &quot;under the bus&quot;
