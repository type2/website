Subject: Re: [T2] won't start...again. what else could it be?

It sounds like theres a short somewhere in the dash.

If you were hitting the brakes and the radio cut out, that is a short.
Almost every dash short I've seen will make the radio cut out.... you
are losing voltage at the short, which could also explain why the dash
lights dim when you try to engage the starter.

I would look very carefully at the dash wiring. Label everything and
try to eliminate what isn't necessary. The wiring diagrams on
vintagebus_dot_com will be a huge help.

&gt; First, electronics are NOT my forte....
&gt;
&gt; Problem:  1973 bus won't start.  the dash lights dim when key is turned to
&gt; start, but nothing else happens (well, nothing except the ticking sound I
&gt; always hear when key is in the on position...
