&gt; &gt;i have a type 2 aircooled vw camper
&gt; &gt;with a c.u 2litre engine. I was wondering if each crankcase was
mached
&gt; &gt;specifically with each flywheel or is  it ok to change one second
hand
&gt; &gt;flywheel for another? coz i have a badly scored flywheel wich i
need to
&gt; &gt;change

You can also get a scored flywheel resurfaced.  Might be cheaper than
the secondhand one.
