Fixed exhaust leak on my 72 Westy last week so I could pick up my kids new 
dirt bike. On the trip  back the westy began to started to smoke. No loss of 
power on freeway but smokes when taking off. Westy has 2.0 with hyd and weber 
carb. It is smog exempt. Engine was put in it 2 years ago. I sold my bug 
yesterday and now it is time for the bus.
It has been good to us for several years but I don't want to shoot it. 
Located in El Toro, California you can have it for $600.00. For details 
E-mail or call 949-581-1256.
