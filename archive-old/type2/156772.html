Subject: Bad Karma

Turns out it must have just been some bad gas.  Or sitting for a  couple of days and maybe a little water at the bottom.  It's been  running fine all day.  And I filled her up with what I hope is  good gas.  But she gave me a good scare.  That'll teach me  not to run her every day.  Cheers...KR
