&gt;It's good to be onboard this list. I'm sure it'll be a great resource.
&gt;Excuse me for asking some obvious newby questions and if the answers are
&gt;archived somewhere, do tell.

&gt;4.  Gas heater  (I know these are marginal at best but):  When I run it all
&gt;I get is gas fumes and no heat. Comments?

This reply is for everyone of those frozen toed bus pilots out there.  I
was at a local RV shop the other day asking about heaters and this is what
they told me.

You can get a Catalytic Safety heater that runs off of propane gas,
designed for RVs and boats that will heat 1600 to 2800 BTUs designed for
110 square feet for $240!

Not only did the price sound good but consider this:
- No moving parts, not even a fan
(no jet engine sound in the middle of the night camping)
- No smell
- Fully adjustable
- 100% safety shut-off valve
- you can hang it on the wall either horizontally or vertically

And get these dimensions - 11 3/4&quot; high, 10 1/4&quot; wide, and 3 1/2&quot; deep!
You could put one up front, and another behind the front seat, or just get
one and move it around wherever you needed it, they are portable.

20 minutes before you get into your frozen bus covered with 1/4&quot; ice on the
windows and 10&quot; of snow on the roof, turn on the heater.  Then after
another cup of coffee, come back outside to a nice warm bus with the ice
melted off the windows, start it up and drive to work.

Because it is portable, what if you need to do some work in the cold
garage, or maybe under the tarp thrown over the bus?

The brand is Olympian, US Catalytic.  Thats all I can tell you, the parts
man wouldn't tell me where the company is located (he wanted to sell them
to me).
