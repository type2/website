Subject: RE: [T2] need location of part

yes, there is a rubber bumper on the wall that seperates the
rim/tire from rubbing against body of the bus.  There is a strap
that will also run through loops in the body and will pull over and
through the rim with a nylon securing bit that will fit into an
angle in the stock rim.  With the strap pulled and fitted correctly
it will bring the spare tightly up against this rubber pad mounted
on the wall.  The housing for the spare sits over the top and is
secured by two metal D clips mounted into the top of the stowage
area.  Sorry Dave,....  No pics here...  I'm certain that somebody
has 'em though.

Once again,... excellant job on your Champagne edition.  She sure is
pretty.
