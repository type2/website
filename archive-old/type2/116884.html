Subject: Manual Window Regulator

Has anyone successfully replaced the window regulator in a baywindow?  Mine 
went bad (the crank just spins, window won't go up nor down)  I have begun 
to remove the old window regulator, but i can't even get the thing out, and 
when i do, how the heck am I gunna get the new one in.  It seems that the U 
shaped hardware should just kinda worm its way around a little bracket that 
is in the door, but the little mount bracket on the window regulator gets 
hung up.  I know it can be done and I'm clearly missing something important. 
  Thanx a bunch.
