Subject: exhaust leaks
Message-ID: &lt;Pine.SOL.3.96.990302194826.11486A-100000_at_techsrv1.tech.mtu_dot_edu&gt;

&gt; From: H Steven Dolan &lt;dworkin_at_mtolympus.ari_dot_net&gt;

&gt; I would agree with others who think it may be an exhaust leak.  I would
&gt; specifically look for a blown seal between the headers/heaterboxes and the
&gt; head.  The best test of this is to start it up in the AM and slap a wad of
&gt; rags over the exhaust.  If the engine does not slow/stall within ~5
&gt; seconds, then there is an exhaust leak.

--&gt;  Once you figure out you have a leak, the best way I've found to
find it is by feel.  Start 'er up, and while the engine's still cool, move
your hand around all the joints in the exhaust system, keeping it maybe an
inch from the pipes.  You'll feel the warm exhaust puffing out if there's
a leak.  You can pinpoint them pretty well this way.  You want to do it on
a cold engine because once it heats up, the warm air from the heads
and heater boxes will throw you off.  (You're also less likely to burn
yourself.)  You can also look for black soot deposits on the flanges,
indicating a current or past leak.

I have constant leak problems on mine, because the flanges are too far
gone to seal anymore, even with thick gaskets.  Haven't decided what to do
about it, yet.  It's become such a common occurrance that I can guess the
location of the leak by the type of sound it makes. :/
