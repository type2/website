Subject: '78 gas filler tube

Grettings,

I'm currently getting my '78 Bus ready to sell but I need to replace
the 2 rubber gas filler tube connector hoses on it.  

They both have hose clamps on them.  The lower hose, on the tank,
can be removed with moderate contortions.  The UPPER hose is going
to be a serious pain though.  I can feel the clamp, but it's in a
position that I can't get at with ANY screw driver.  My question
on this is, if I remove the bottom hose going into the tank, can 
I pull the whole filler tube assembly out the gas cap hole??

BTW, I note in the archives that Bus Boys carries(ed) replacement
rubber for this.

Thanks!!

Mark
