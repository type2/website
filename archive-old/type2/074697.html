Subject: Riveria Window Seekers (no luck)

--part1_57.76b601.290456f6_boundary

       I've had a few folks looking to score Riveria Windows.  There was a 
set I mentioned I'd check on.  Well, the wrecking yard had a $35 all you 
could carry yesterday.  I headed back to where the Riveria was, it was gone!  
I later saw it on top of the crusher pile (my heart sank)  The pop top was 
up, and it was on top of the stack about 7 cars up.  The side windows I was 
hope'n to get had been busted out by the forks of the fork lift.  I'll keep 
looking.  For those of you with just busted latches, I put a piece of all pop 
top support in the window track, sorta like you do with sliding glass patio 
doors.  Works great!
       On the up side I scored quite a few bug parts for my daughters 64 1/2 
bug.  Drivers side floor pan (new never installed), wind shield, pop outs, 
couple of steering wheels, lots of odds and ends.  It was a good day for Bug 
parts.
       Maybe next time the buses will come thru.  I'll keep trying!!
                                                                             
Peace,

   Too many VW's to list
