Subject: Engine Drop

I'm planing on dropping my engine soon to replace some leaky seals.
All the info in the Library and Archives instructs dropping both engine and
tranny. Haynes suggests its easier to drop just the engine as long as the
tranny is supported. Any tricks to make this easier? Any draw-backs to doing
it this way?
