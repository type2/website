Subject: Re: [T2] Just added up the cost of parts that I want/need for 
  my bus

I assumed I would find deals around, or some stuff used, etc. But I was
budgeting based on BD's price list. Not counting shipping (oops).

Sometime this fall I'll start my quest to find used HEs. I realized that I
don't need heat, but the family does. ;-) My wife gets cold if it's under
72. I don't start getting cold until the temps hit 60. We drive each other
nuts. It's gotten to the point where she keeps a blanket in the car in
winter so she can bundle up while I'm cruising with my window open and a
T-shirt on.

&gt; &gt;first you NEVER add it up, because you can not afford it.
&gt;
&gt; &gt;it is always just one part after another...only count the cost of the
next
&gt; &gt;part you need
&gt; --------------------------------------------------------------------------
----------------------------------------------------------
&gt; Plus you can't do it all at once unless you are a lucky SOB. Try to focus
&gt; and get what you need to get started. Along the way you will be suprised
&gt; what you might find for less than what you were going to pay for. Others
&gt; have done this and sit parts they bought only to later rethink their
&gt; strategy and find themselves with parts they could have spent the money on
&gt; what they didn't think about or plan on changing.
