Subject: Re: Needing a VW mechanic....

Thanks.  Where in Asheville is the campout???  And when???  If I'm up and 
running, I'd love to go!  Like I said in my email, I don't really have the 
time to do the work myself.  I work M-F 40-55 hrs, then more hours at a 
restaurant at night.  I feel fairly comfortable doing the work myself, as 
I've been doing, but just too wore out.  Know what I mean?

I would appreciate anyone's help.  I'm new to this area and I don't know 
about the shops around here.  I've had several bad experiences in Oklahoma 
where I moved from and don't want to go through that again.  Like I said, I 
have all the parts; I just need someone to put the rest of her back together 
(tins, plugs, wires, rear seal) and to time her.  When I first got her, she 
was FI, but I had it converted to carb.  I lost a little power, but I really 
don't like FI.

What do you think would be a fair price to pay for something like this???  
Anyone's assistance in this area would be appreciated.

Thanks again.
