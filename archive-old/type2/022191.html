ok, so my engine stopped and wouldn't turn...
got towed to Truckee...
a week later, i get it together and rent a tow dolly and borrow a friends
truck...
the tow company hooked on to the rear and tied the wheel...
a week later...
the comedy of errors begins - i get up there and my right rear shock is
hanging down?? hmm... i check it out and the cast part behind the wheel is
broken off and attached to the shock. rust on the break? what? how did i
miss that... 
*anyway*

the tow dolly is just a tad too high, bus just a tad to low... tear the
freakin' muffler pipe off trying to get it on.
tie the steering wheel and get going... few miles and it starts to whip
back and forth...
tie off the other side of the wheel - wheel *will not* move...
few miles and it's at it again.

we get off I-80 and drop it, hook it onto the front wheels...
got about 10 miles, and the right rear tire blows -- rubber flies.
Memorial day weekend - maximum enforcement... i'm thinking impound
fees?nothanks.
rim is shot - no spare, so i tow it a mile at 2mph and get it off the road. 
take another shot on Saturday.

there just isn't anywhere you can get a rim [no spare] on Memorial Day
Weekend evidently.

Sunday i rent a truck, come-along, and *trailer* [Uhaul *loves* me] - the
tow went significantly smoother this time... the moral: if you're going to
tow yourself - bring the big guns the *first* time.
so it's home... finally, i drop the engine and start stripping it on Monday
morning.

everything seems satisfactory until 
i got all the way down to the pistons - what *is* the trick to getting the
wrist pins out?
Muir says i need to use a 10 - 8 mm and tap them towards the flywheel.
to start, the 10 goes through the middle.. so i used the 15mm which fit
nicely on the 16mm diameter pin. 
I stop when it &quot;hits&quot; the piston next to it - which *is not* far out enough
for the rod to come off.
as for my guessing #3 being siezed...
i have a sneaky suspicion its the rod bearings on #2 [all the rods/pistons
i can move freely with my hand as they stick out of the case *except* #2
which is very tight]
had to quit and come back to Reno...
next weekend i will crack the case and check it *all*

any suggestions?
i also need to know *what* to call that cast part on the rear wheel is...
[besides &quot;broken piece of sh*t&quot;  and *if* should i happen to find one in
the yard - how compatible it is between years... i'm looking.
thanks -
