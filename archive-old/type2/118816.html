Subject: RE: [T2] Exhaust conversion

Hi Alex,
I converted my 77 bus to a 72-74 exhaust system when I rebuilt my engine.
The triangular flanges of my 75/78 exhaust system were rotten though the
pipes themselves were in good shape with a near new muffler, I was given a
serviceable set of 72/74 heater boxes and a like new, only slightly bent
stainless steel Leister muffler (which I straitened out on a hydraulic
press).  In my exhaust conversion I didn't realize until assembly that I had
to replace the lower tin pieces on my engine, and the alternator bracket
(which connects from the engine case to the exhaust which the alternator
tension bolt attaches to) is different as well.  This may not be a factor
with your 79 CAL exhaust system but may be worth checking out.

I have since found a local VW shop which has a jig to reweld/rebuild
triangle flange exhaust systems, they charge something like $30 a flange.

Cheers,
Drew
