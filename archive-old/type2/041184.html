Subject: Re: replacing nuts 

Alex Wisniewski sends:

&gt; Most of you remember I am in the middle of a engine overhaul.
&gt; So I was thinking I should replace the old rusty nuts that hold
&gt; the cylinder heads on the studs.
&gt; I dont know if nuts are prone to breaking when there old or not
&gt; but I figured I might as well do it instead of having to do it later.
&gt; So my question is what nuts should I buy? I know there is a lot of
&gt; different kinds....hardened steel, galvanized.
&gt; What would work good on the aluminum heads and steel studs(right?)?

Rocky Mountain Motorworks (and probably the Bus Depot, though I haven't
looked--bet he could get you some, tho) has exact replacements for what came
on the car. Use those. And get new washers too, just to be sure.

The nuts themselves are Grade 8 metric nuts.
