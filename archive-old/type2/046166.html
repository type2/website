Hi Chad,

More than 1 inch of play at the outer circumference of the steering wheel is
too much.  Check all of the steering related joints and the steerring box for
play and or lubrication.  It's a pain to drive a brick wall in the wind with
loose steering, or to pass a big rig in the wind.  A real E-ticket ride.
