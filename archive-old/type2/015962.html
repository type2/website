&gt;Bus sighting:
&gt;Front page of the Chicago Tribune Monday, June 21, 1999. A Reuters photo
&gt;by Russel Boyce. The caption doesn't say anything about the bus in the
&gt;foreground, but it's in Kosovo, no doubt, and it's a 73-79 white loaf
&gt;with several serious modifications. It has a radiator mounted on the
&gt;nose,aftemarket mirrors, no drivers door handle, possibly all left side
&gt;windows blown out, and, possibly most significant, a bullet hole that
&gt;looks like it got the driver right between the eyes. (Ain't war great!)
&gt;This has not dissuaded the occupants, three of whom are pushing the bus
&gt;down a hill. Maybe it was stuck?
&gt;Looks like it was a pretty clean loaf before the war.

I saw that too, and I bought a copy of the paper.  If anyone is really
interested I will scan it in.  There was a caption which said something
about Albanians retaliating against the serbs, which seemed to suggest that
the three men were vandalizing the bus, but it sure looked like they were
trying to push-start it.
