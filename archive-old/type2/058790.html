Subject: Fuel Tank removal: '72 Westy

Hi All:
Just wanted to tell you all how the fuel tank removal went.

As you may recall, I was stuck by two sheet metal screws holding the panel to the fuel tank compartment.  I tried everything that fellow listees recommended: using a stubby screwdriver, using an extra long screwdriver, prying down on the transmission mounting bracket with a crowbar (to get that extra 1/2&quot; of space) while getting a screwdriver in there, drilling two holes just below the two screws in the transmission mounting bracket.

I was stopped dead cold on all fronts, until, as I was prying with the crowbar to make room for the screwdriver, it occurred that with a little mediaeval force I could pop those screws out of there.  One listee relayed to me that he had not replaced those two screws anyway - so with F = MA on my side I tore those screws out!

When I peered into the compartment I thought to myself:  &quot;You Dumbass, there is now way there is going to be any rust in there, its' just too clean in here&quot;  and I almost stopped.  Instead I came up here to my trusty PC and searched the archives one more time: found a thread on this very subject in which the fellow stated he almost quit at that point also because it was so clean in the fuel tank compartment.  I carried on.  It amazes me how they get things to fit on these vehicles sometimes.  That tank was a bast*&amp;d coming out - and I am sure will be a &quot;3X Basta*d&quot; going back in.  It was tough getting it out, being very careful and all.

I got the tank on the floor, removed the sender and shined a light in.  Yup, you guessed it, rust all over the inside!

Tenacity paid off once more.- found a local shop to clean and coat (Red Coat?) it.

One more step closer.....
