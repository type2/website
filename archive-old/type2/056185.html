Subject: I need a Trailor Hitch

I am planning on pulling a light weight trailor with the Mothership and
need a hitch for it.

I know the 1600 engines need a certain type and believe that I also need a
certain albeit different type.  If anyone has one laying around and want to
part with it please e mail me.

Also, does anyone know the pulling capacity of a bus with a 2.0 litre engine?

Thanks,

Charlie
