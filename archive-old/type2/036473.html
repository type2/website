&gt; Hi volks,
&gt; Just bought a CO detector for the bus.  I was reading the instructions and it

&gt; And if I can still use it considering it will get below that (not much) at
&gt; night when no one is in the bus.

40F???  Could that be a typo?  CO detector = exhaust = HOT.  The air/fuel ratio
detectors usually want to see temps around 600F and I could see a typo being &quot;do
not mount anywhere the temp gets below 400 degrees F&quot;.  That is why you will
usually see the detectors mounted on the exhaust pipe, right after the
collectors.  Are we talking the same kind of detector here?
