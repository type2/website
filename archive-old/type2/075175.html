Subject: Oily to Rise........

Here's a question for all you theoreticians out there...........

With the onset of colder weather I am wondering about the oil in my beloved
74 Riviera. It's an 1800 with about 7000 miles on a top-notch rebuild. I am
currently using Castrol 20/50 Synthetic and it works wonderfully; good
lubrication, cool running, and I don't leak a drop. Now that the mornings
are getting chill I wonder if I should go to the 10/40 weight synthetic Does
the benefit of having a lighter weight oil during cold starts outweigh the
possible increased wear at operating temps?

C'mon now, I know somebody has an opinion!

Dave
