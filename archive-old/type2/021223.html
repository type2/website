&gt; Hi All!
&gt;
&gt; I have a '71 and the wiper motor runs very slowly. And there isn't much of a
&gt; change in speed between low and high. Is this normal or should I be looking
&gt; for a new motor or is it possibly something else? I've look around and, of
&gt; course, a wiper motor seems to be one of the most expensive single part you
&gt; can buy for your bus!! &gt;:-(

I took mine apart and re-distributed the grease.  It had all shifted to the
outside of the gear housing.  Greased the shafts and she worked fine.

Good Luck
