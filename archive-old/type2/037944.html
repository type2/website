Subject: Anyone need a new german 72+ upright muffler?

Due to a bit of a mix up, it looks like i have a nice looking brand new
(opened it this morning) muffler for the euro-style 72-73 (should work
with &gt;73...) bus with the upright engine installed.

This muffler is very similar to the normal bus opright muffler, except
that the outlet for the exhaust is on the .other. side of the muffler
(pass. side) from where the cutout is on the &gt;71 aprons...

the tailpipe still exits on the drivers side, it uses a much longer damper
pipe to connect to the tailpipe.

Any of you needing such, let me know.  I've got ~108 dollars in it, and
I'm sure Ron would rather find a new home for it then take it back and
ship it again....

Delivery to Everybus (and .maybe. this Jax thing..) available, or
arrangements could be made for pickup/deliveyr in the south east US.  Or
pay to ship it again.  whatever.


Btw, the manuacturer is Ernst...even the warrenty card is on german.
Looks .nicely. built.  I'd love to have the .correct. one for my bus!:)

thanks...david
