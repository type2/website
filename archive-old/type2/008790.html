&gt; Disposal of the dregs is an evironmental nightmare. I'd be tempted to

&gt; maybe a gallon of methanol, and just drive it away! Next best idea is:
&gt; remove tank, slosh it around with solvent in it, pour it out on sand
or
&gt; gravel drive, get the tank a long way away, light it with a match. 
&gt; WHOOMP!! (if it's volatile) At least this keeps it out of streams and

Not quite.  Some of what you pour on the ground will soak in before it
burns, which eventually gets to groundwater.

If you're going to burn flammable liquids it's better to do it in a
metal container open at the top, such as a coffee can.  Be sure to put
the can in the open, a long way from flammables, and light it from afar.

I don't generally like to do this, but sometimes the hazardous waste
disposal regs are a Catch-22.
