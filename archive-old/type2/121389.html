Strange... I can't speak for other people but mine have been pretty much zero-maintenance since I installed them.  Occasionally when the bus has been sitting for a LONG time (couple of weeks) I get some clatter at startup but it always goes away once the motor is warmed up.  Definately not a PITA for me, compared to the... 35-odd valve adjustments I would have had to do if I had not had hydraulics.  I prefer driving my bus to lying underneath it.
