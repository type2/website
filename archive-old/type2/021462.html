Why do you need a 36mm socket?  Don't you have like two 10mm bolts (or
something close to) on the drum that you can unscrew and pull the drum
off.  That's what it's like on my 76...  Takes a few seconds to pull off
the drum and inspect the brakes..

&gt; Just missed my inspection on acct of the handbrake not meeting the spec on
&gt; my 75 bus.  The right rear hand brake does not engage (though works fine on
&gt; the left side) and the brakes generally work great all around.
&gt; 
&gt; I'm still looking for a 36mm socket to get a look at the brakes on the side
&gt; where they are failing, but wondered if anyone else has run into this same
&gt; problem.  Parts needed?  Workaround?  Thanks in advance.
