Volks,

I have been tuning up a long neglected 1700cc on a 1972 bus with dual
webers. I am getting a noise like that listed in the title.
A brief power surge then Pugh, where it kicks gas back up into the carbs.
I did just do a valve adjustment, but I cheated and used the paint mark on
the pulley without verifying TDC. Also, there was no paint mark at 180
Degrees and I eyeballed it. (So much for DM).

When I bought it, I threw on an 009 to get it running as I was having
problems with the 050 that was on there. Seems to have little power, so I
ordered the cap, rotor and points for the 050 and will replace as soon as
they arrive. I also have the original vacuum advance dizzy, but to place to
hook up the vacuum to on the new Webers.

Timing is dead on at 5 degrees ATDC. Also restored and installed an old
exhaust with heater boxes as the old one fell into rusted pieces when I took
it out.  

I am leaning towards valves first, distributor next.

I have dumped all the old gas, changed the filter and the gas lines. New
oil, bosch plugs, coil, oil filter, air filters.

Any thoughts.

Matt
