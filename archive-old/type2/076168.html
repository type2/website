Subject: Re: [T2] fuel line size


From: &quot;John Hartranft&quot; &lt;jhartan_at_tir_dot_com&gt;

&gt; &gt;on a 71, where did you put 10mm FUEL HOSE????
&gt; &gt;
&gt; I didn't.  My point was that it's overkill to buy bus fuel line from a
&gt; Mercedes dealer.

This question on FI fuel hose size comes up about once a year. It is not
overkill when you can't get it at your local parts store. Try going down to
where ever you shop for crap Gates hose and see if they have 10mm fuel hose.
Sure, they have 1/4&quot; and 5/16&quot; hose that won't handle much pressure.....
