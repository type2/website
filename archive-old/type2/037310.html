Subject: RE: Cheap buses

What is a cheap Bus?? 

I own a $15K Single Cab and it's still not finished. It's still not perfect, there are still things 
I want to change. I'm not the kind of person to be working on a specific car all of the time, 
I like doing maintanance, or improving little things that didn't really need repair or replacement, 
and I like building a car from the ground up, but when I'm done I really want to be done. 

A cheap Bus for daily transportation is a Bus that runs well, doesn't have to many rust through 
areas, doesn't make much strange noises, of which all equipment is working, basically a Bus 
that is in daily driver condition to start with. Any other Bus is expensive. You want to replace the 
muffler, but you'll end up doing the heater boxes too. Not only money, work and time is a factor 
as well. I've owned over 40 VWs, mostly Busses (sp?) and most of them represented the $100 
dream car, yet the cheap ones almost always turn out to be the most expensive, I got this 
single cab for free btw...  have a look at http://www_dot_casema_dot_net/~verbeekb/morepics.htm if you 
like. VWs are not cheap, the Berg philosphy as well as Murpy's applies here imho. I understand 
not everyone's goal is to end up with a show quality car, that's not my goal either, yet, when I do 
something, I want to do it right, or as right as I can at least. I also don't want to dicourage anyone
from buying a VW, certainly not, please do, and have a lot of fun getting to know it, explore it, and 
see the things that are different than what you've seen before, feel the spirit that comes with 
them,  simply enjoy them, but buy a good base, that's really important, to speak in Bug terms, 
a $2000 little rust car is a *lot* cheaper than a $100 basket case, I wish someone would have 
told me that before I started dreaming about VWs :-) I could go on and on about the parts that 
some supplier try to push through our throats, but I'm affraid it would get a little too lenghty, 
next time I'll try to be a little more positive :) 

Happy Motoring!

Brian.
