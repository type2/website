&gt; &gt; My bus did not come with a jack.  I have not seen any documentation stating what kind of jack to use or where to put it.  I have been using the floor jack, but I don't want to take that on a trip.  Is it a scissor jack?  Where is it stored?

&gt; no it was a screw jack and not all that good.
&gt; busdepot has a better newer scissor version

I have an original screw jack and it works fine.  In fact, it one of the
easiest jacks I've used.  One thing that is important is to keep the jack
screw greased, as it can cause trouble if it dries out.

A real sticking point with old buses is the jack points.  They are prone
to rust or to damage done by the bus rolling when it is jacked up.  You
absolutely have to block the opposite wheel whenever jacking up a corner
of the bus!  The jack is not made to stop fore-aft motion!
