The bus FI system is a very simple but effective system. The best
advice is for you to first make sure all connections are very solid.
The simple fact that you are moving the system from one bus to another
should help by removing connections last touched (perhaps) when people
had just heard of break dancing.

The other bit of advice I would add, is go ahead and purchase the
diagnostic tools needed to test the system if something is wrong. The
main addition to a decent tool kit is a pressure gauge for the FI
ring, and a good multimeter to test electrical. You should already
have a vacuum gauge, but if not pick one up. In addition to bad
connections, having a vacuum leak really plays havvoc with the FI
system. Give it a go and when  setup properly you will LOVE it.
