Subject: Getting Hooked!!

Getting Hooked, passing on the tradition.

Through the years I have had many really good students, but some stand out
more than others.  Rhett was one of those students who had his own agenda
and pestered me enough that I gave in.  I was glad he was so insistent, as
we developed a thriving curriculum around Rhetts idea.  Following in my
footsteps Rhett became a shop teacher, and has found the joys of molding
young minds.

A few weeks ago, my daughter Rachel and I drove our '76 westy up to visit
Rhett and his family.  While Rachel was playing with Rhett's two boys,
Rhett and his wife checked out the westy.  I guess the westy made an
impression on Rhett because the other night he called me up all excited
letting me know he had found a westy of his own!

Now many people have been bitten by the bus before and have found one to
fix up, but in true teacher fashion, Rhett is taking his bus to school
where the students will help him repair, sand and paint the bus!  Now the
story could have stopped there, but as with an energetic teacher, the
enthusiasm rubs off to their students.  Rhetts students have now formed an
air cooled club and are scouring the country side for more VW's!!!!

Good job Rhett.

Ramblings from an old shop teacher,
