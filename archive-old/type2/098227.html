Subject: Re: [T2] timing and pinging question 

Paul,

Don't feel like an idiot!  You are still learning, but you are asking the
right questions, which goes a long way!  And you are asking them *before*
you drive 1000 miles with an overheating engine, which is a *really* good
thing!!!  Below are comments on your reply.

I'm going to do a general purpose post on distributors, since your raised
the subject.  I'll start tonight, but as we approach 11PM here in
Virginia, posting tomorrow night seems more likely :-)

Paul, I found this in the library, which appears to be the distributor you
are running:

If you look at the second number, it is the same as what you see on your
distributor except for one number, and given the age of the dist, I call
that close enough :-)  If you remove the distributor and clean it with
steel wool, you will almost certainly get to that number and will find the
113-905-205AJ or 043-905-205C number imprinted below it covered in 30
years of road mung.

This is not the distributor that came in your bus when it was new, but it
is a perfectly valid distributor to use in your bus, so let's ride with
it.  This distributor has three different things happening with regard to
the spark advance, as you can see in the last entry (Advance/Retard Range)
First it has a mechanical advance, second it has a vacuum advance, and
third it has a vacuum retard.  In order to have decent performance two of
the three functions have to be working correctly (you can get around a
dead vacuum retard)

&gt; I was told it was a 50 but I guess it's a 049.

Paul, this is a &quot;term of art&quot;  You would not know it walking in the
(electronic) door, but on the list, distributors tend to be referenced by
the last set of digits of the VW rather than the Bosch number.  I *think*
what you have is a 205AJ, but time will tell. I am going to compose and
post a procedure for checking distributors later tonight (or tomorrow).
Read it and see if it helps.

&gt; My dwell is at 24 on the 8 cyl scale.

Good! I figured that was the case.  24 is fine, I woudl leave that alone.
OK, I would try to improve it by resetting it again and again for 1/2 an
hour, but that's because I like my dwell from 49-51 and am really tedious
about it.  Feel free to ignore me (I would in this instance :-)

&gt; I realize that . 016 is the initial setting, for the points.

Check.

&gt; I need to bump that up to 25 which would be 50 on the 4 cyl scale.

Nah, not really :-)

&gt; The engine block is also a AE part number, which I failed to mention.

Good to know, but at this point in your buses life, not too important.  I
had an AE block in my '71 super beetle, which matches the spec for the
distributor.  It is, no doubt, a dual port engine, check?  It is probably
a beetle engine someone got at a junkyard and installed with the oil pump
rear mount adapter.  the adapters work, but they just leak :-(

&gt; My comment on vaccum was related to the hose condition and sucking on
&gt; the advance. But no I have not used a guage.

Paul, I am sorry to say you *have* to go out and buy a gauge.  I am
incredibly solid on this, especially if you have a dual port engine.  The
boots between the center section and the ends are famous for springing
leaks and that loss of vacuum can cause exactly the symptoms you are
experiencing.  An Actron vacuum gauge at any FLAPS (friendly local auto
parts store) or a Craftsman gauge at Sears will cost you ~20 and is worth
every penny!  You are very lucky if you actually still have the original
intake manifold, BTW.  There is a manifold vacuum port in the left end
casting that is very useful for checking vacuum (and shuld be where your
vacuum retard line is plugged in, BTW)

I am 90% certain after this that your problem is going to be vacuum
related, tho it could turn out to be a wonky distributor.

&gt; Timing is set to the notch in the pulley, with the vaccum hooked up.

OK. from Jim Thompson's page, with the 205AJ dist, timing should be set at
5deg ATDC at 800-950 RPM.  *IF* you have the original pulley (not certain,
but a pretty safe bet) then you should have two notches.  the one on the
left is for TDC (and setting valves); the timing to the notch on the right
is at 5 BTDC and will be fine for timing to.  The problem is that VW made
half a dozen different pulleys wiht half a dozen different notches.  If
you pulley was replaced at any point, then the notches mean nothing and
you are up a creek.  I like degree wheel pullies on T1 engines, even tho
the quality of them is truly horrendous :-(  I usually have to buy one,
install it, discover it is flawed (either rubs on the tin or has bad
run-out (wobble)), pull it, exchange it, install second, third, etc. until
i get a good one.  I could save time by buying Berg, but I am cheap and
Berg is not.
