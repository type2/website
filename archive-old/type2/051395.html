I wrapped it up and posted the correct answer on the page.  Go back to
http://www.type2_dot_com/dworkin/whatzit/week2.htm
to see that it is the adjusting clamp from the bottom of a vent wing
window!  No one got it :-(  Though Ken gave the week's most amusing wrong
answer :-) 
Oh, well... next week I will try to get somewhere in the middle :-)
Tough, but not impossible.
