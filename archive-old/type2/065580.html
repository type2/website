&gt;It's not just a supposition. I mail one of the VIP of this club and he 
&gt;tell me that officialy we can't (my friend JF is in the same situation) 
&gt;but they had to talk about that and to take a decision.

Who would want to join a group where other members had their heads so far up
their asses? Jean, you're better off. Start your own club!
