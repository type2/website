Subject: Re: [T2] shift adjustment threads

Yeah, I'm looking at the picture now and that's a good point.  I did
pull it off and replace my shifter and if I remember, the stop plate
only stops it side to side (x axis), not front back.  The slots in the
bracket allow you to move the whole thing back and forth.

I am going to assume here, so I could be wrong, but if you stay out of
the extreme front and back of the slotted holes on the bracket (to avoid
any wierd binding), you'll probably be good.  Then I guess it'd just be
how far forward or backward you want your shifter to sit comfortably
(and not hit the e-brake).

&gt; --the Bentley shows the lower end of the stick at 90 degrees from the floor of the bus on the &quot;x&quot; axis if you're sitting in the driver seat.
&gt; 
&gt; are we to assume that 90 degrees applies in the &quot;y&quot; direction (front to back of the bus) and therefore the lower end of the stick it to be perfectly perpendicular to the bus' floor?
&gt; 
&gt; I'm having trouble with this adjustment right now too.

&gt; Be sure to get the plate aligned correctly so you're stickshift has the correct throw (look in the bentley, it's really easy).
