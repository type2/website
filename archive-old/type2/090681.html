Subject: Re: [T2] My mouse story and a nest.

More Mouse.
Years ago I lived in the country.
I was driving a 78 Camaro at the time and one morning after leaving the
house and getting onto the freeway up to 70 mph.
A little mouse came from the windshield wiper storage area next to the
windshield. He walked along the chrome strip and heroically jumped to the
mirror, all the time being flailed by his tiny tail.
I had manual windows and I was cranking like crazy but he beat me to it
and jumped right into the car.
There was a little swerving and swearing but I got everything under
control before I totally freaked.
I reasoned that he was pretty scared and wasn't going to show again for a
while.
I got him out by placing peanut butter crackers on the top of a cardboard
box next to the car with the door open. The cracker was eaten and I never
saw this brave little trooper again.
