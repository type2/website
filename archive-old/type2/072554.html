Greetings List!
We have been driving our rebuilt 78 Transporter now for about a week and everything is excellent!  After witnessing first hand the abuse my cylinder heads took from the overheating caused by the previous owner (missing engine tin, lack of seal, three inches of dirt, debris and leaves packed into the cooling fins etc.) I am very interested in installing some sort of temperature guage and/or oil pressure guage in order to monitor the running condition of the motor.  The &quot;dipstick check&quot; doesnt provide me a whole lot of comfort.  I have reviewed the archives and library, but am still unclear on the best/easiest method of accomplishing this task.  Someone suggests that an oil pressure guage is all that is needed as it is directly related to temperature.  Is this a safe assumption?  Should I install a cylinder head temperature guage or an oil temperature guage?  As I am sure there are many options available, I am very interested in hearing your suggestions.  Thanks in advance!

Chad
