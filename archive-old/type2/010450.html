Subject: Does transmission gear oil ever wear out?
Message-ID: &lt;19991025221053.89409.qmail_at_hotmail_dot_com&gt;

To the best of my knowledge, the transmission gear oil in my '75 may be the 
original from the factory. I didn't own it when the first free service came 
up, (in Lusanne, Switzerland!) but did buy it shortly thereafter from the 
volks who brought it back from Europe, and I haven't changed it in all these 
years. The owner's manual doesn't call for a change beyond the first 
service. I notice that the transmission is hard to shift when I first start 
up, but it gets easier as it warms. Does that suggest I should dump the old 
oil? Anyone think its important to get a certain weight or brand of oil? I'd 
appreciate receiving the vast wisdom from the group that any would like to 
share.
