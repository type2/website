&gt;The manifold on many of these kits (all that I have seen)
&gt;look extremely cheap--maybe this doesnt actually matter
&gt;for anything, but it sure doesnt make you feel good
&gt;buying one.

Well even the best of them the manifold runners are very, very
small compared to FI intake runners or the ports in the heads.
They are about 1mm on the radius smaller than 1.7 ports which
makes them quite a bit smaller than 2.0 ports.  I've got a DFEV
I use to break in engines on the engine stand and I occasionally
will toss it in a bus to retrieve something that isn't running.  I sure
wouldn't swap a running L-jet for it in my climate, and don't see
any performance improvement in using it.  But I got it free and it
will run a T4 engine.  The manifolds on mine were even worse than
some as they were welded to the flanges on the ID of the tubes,
reducing the terrible cross section even further, seems about 1/2
the kits I've seen have been this way, mostly older kits.  I took
the MIG to it and welded around the OD and then ground and
ported mine out a bit to match the stock 1.7 port ID, might help
a bit, who knows.  Anyway just goes to show you someone out
there is always happy with what others aren't so try stuff out for
yourself before you take anyones advice.  But with what the DFEV
kit is going for new these days, I'd try to scrape one up for $40 or
$50 at a show or something and blow $20 on the rebuild kit to do
the trying.  I wonder if the manifold runners aren't so small in
considering it to try to keep the velocity up enough to get the
fuel in before it condeses on the walls of the long cold runners.
Once again my standard tip use metal bug exhaust manifold
gaskets on the intakes as they will help conduct heat up the
runners in cooler climates.
