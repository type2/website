The just-in-time manufacturing process is (we were taught) based on current tax laws which tax inventory. Also that wharehouse costs money to maintain, build, heat/cool, and naturally there is a certain amount of inventory loss to theft, accidents, and of course frequent design changes could render a wharehouse of inventory obsolete. 

It is just another one of those ways companies try to cut costs to maintain a competitive edge when faced with so many rising costs - labor being the most notable (union wages, pensions, Mexico). Read the other day that GM and Ford are basically giving away their cars and making their corporate profit from their financial departments (CREDIT). $3500 of each new car GM builds is spent on pensions for retired workers. 1 worker vs. 3 retirees...
