Subject: Re: KYB shocks

Hey Chip

I have a suggestion, but it's based on my experience with my
'60 bug.  When I got the bolt out of the rubber bushing in the
head of the shock, I had a similar problem.

The new shock had a metal collar already in the rubber bushing.
The old metal collar had fused to the bolt.  I cold-chiseled the
old collar off the bolt, polished up the bolt, smeared a bunch of
the aluminum Permatex anti-seize onto the part of the bolt where
it goes through the metal collar, and reattached the works.

Hope this is useful on your Type II!

        TTFN

&gt; I got around to attempting to install my rear KYB's. The old shock
&gt; was in such poor condition that it would not have surprised me
&gt; if it was the origonal. So anyway, here is my quandry. The 
&gt; bolt that holds th top of the shock gets wider where the threads
&gt; end as you get closer to the head. In the origonal shock it fit
&gt; into the rubber bushing on the shock. On the KYB it will not
&gt; go through.
