                                        Day Five

When I was no more than about ten years old, my father bought me a copy 
of _Alone_  by Rear Admiral Robert E. Byrd. I devoured that book, about 
Byrd's winter in a weather shack in Antarctica, and since then have 
favored accounts of solo adventures. Joshua Slocum, Robert Manry, Francis 
Chichester, Colin Fletcher: these were the books of my teenage years. 
Once, an English teacher forebad me to give any more book reports on solo 
adventure narratives. I don't know when I figured this out, but somewhere 
along the line I saw that most adventure narratives do not have a 
perfect, symmetrical shape. There comes a time in the narrative when the 
adventurer decides the journey is over, and he just wants to go home.

I reached that point Sunday morning. I had driven 650 miles in Peregrine, 
my 1976 bus, and it had indeed been an adventure. A small adventure, well 
suited to a 46-year old academic who had once foresworn adventures, who 
had vowed to be an ordinary consumer and take his vehicles to be serviced 
by full-time mechanics, but who recanted and bought a VW bus. The 
discovery that came the day before, that I had a broken valve stem and 
that I would have to drop the engine and remove the heads once more, took 
most of the wind out of my sails. I just wanted to go home.

More to the point, I just wanted to _get_ home.

10. Organ Pipe Cactus National Monument to El Centro, California

Since the first day on the road, I have been regulating my speed by 
listening for a buzzing sound that came in at about 3500 rpm. Now, headed 
north toward Ajo and Gila Bend, the sound occured at lower speeds. I 
could scarcely do 50 mph on the flat. Which was okay with me until a blue 
and white splitty with Colorado plates passed me on the road and raced 
out of sight. What good is a two liter engine if one of these clumsy 
little puppies can outperform it? I decided to experiment; so far, I 
hadn't gone at full throttle. Not once. So I accelerated through the 
buzzing and found that at the top of the curve the buzzing disappeared. I 
was back up over 60 mph and climbing hills with new-found vigor. I might 
get home today yet.

At Ajo, not knowing what the bad valve might be doing to my fuel economy, 
I stopped to gas up. Still 22 mpg! But in the forty or so miles from 
Organ Pipe I had lost a quart of oil. It was leaking, not burning, and 
that was good. At first I supposed that it was leaking from the right 
valve cover, which I had had on and off two or three times yesterday 
fussing with the valve adjustment. No doubt the cork gaskets were not 
sealing anymore. No problem, I thought. When I get to Yuma I will find a 
FLAPs and replace the gaskets. In the meantime, I will stop every forty 
miles and pour in a quarter of oil. 

By my next stop, just short of Gila Bend, it was clear to me that the 
valve covers were not my problem. There seemed to be small leaks 
everywhere. Of course, I realized, I was getting blow-by from the bad 
valve. Stopping in Yuma for gaskets would do no good, but what could I 
do? I now had fewer that 300 miles still to go. If I added oil every 40 
miles, I could get home on a mere seven quarts. That didn't seem so bad.

But over time, the problem worsened. By the time I got to Yuma I was 
adding oil every thirty miles. I stalled at the fruit inspection station 
across the river in California; while adding oil there a CHP pulled up 
behind me and asked if I needed help. I said no; he said &quot;be careful.&quot; 
And then he sat in his car, engine idling, while I went over all my hoses 
and wires. What is he waiting for, I wondered. And I started to get rattled.

&gt;From then on, I found that I was mistake-prone. Once, after topping up 
oil, I drove two or three miles before the oil light came on. I stopped 
and pulled over to find that I had left the filler cap off! I topped up 
again and noticed that the idle screw was missing from its threaded hole 
in the throttle. For thirty minutes I searched for the screw, finally 
finding it stuck in the gas breather pipe at the top of the engine 
compartment! And so it went, on to El Centro, where I pulled into a Pep 
Boys and bought a case of oil. I wouldn't need it all, I thought, but 
better to be prepared.

11. The leak progresses

I needed it all. Thirty miles west of El Centro I faced the steep eastern 
escarpment of the peninsular range of mountains, the last obstacle 
between me and home in San Diego. I settled into first gear and began to 
climb. By now it was maybe 4:00 in the afternoon, and there seemed to be 
a lot of tourist traffic. Hostile traffic. People were passing me without 
getting all the way into the passing lane. After what seemed an eternity 
I got to the top of the first grade and the oil light came on. Time for 
oil. Two quarts. A couple miles down the road, and once again the oil 
light. Two more quarts. Another mile, another two quarts. Now I was 
nearly out of oil. 

I couldn't see where it was coming from; I couldn't keep the engine 
idling well enough to walk back and check. So I fished my remote starter 
out of the tool box and watched for a break in traffic long enough that I 
could slip under the bus and attach the leads to the starter solenoid. 
When that was done, I ran the starter, opened the throttle with a stick, 
and saw that I had a substantial oil leak coming from somewhere behind 
the fan.

By this point, though, I wasn't thinking straight. I was still 
conceptualizing the leak as a generalized condition: a little oil from 
the breather, a little from the filler and dipstick, a little from the 
valve covers, all caused by blow-by and all adding up to a progressively 
growing leak. I topped up the oil again and drove another mile. The red 
light came on; I was out of oil. Home was still 70 miles to the west.

The trip was over. I called AAA, and I had Peregrine towed to a place 
where I could leave her for a few days until I could tow her home or fix 
her. My wife drove and picked me up. As we pulled onto the highway headed 
west, I suddenly saw the problem in my mind's eye. The rear seal must be 
shot. I must have cocked it when I put it in, and now it's destroyed. I 
vowed to come back out in two days, pull the hub, fix the seal, and drive 
Peregrine home.

                                        Epilogue

On Tuesday, we tried just that. Somehow I convinced my wife that I knew 
what the problem was and that I could fix it. We drove to the local VW 
parts store, picked up a new seal, and headed east. The repair went 
quickly, but a fierce wind was blowing sand everywhere. With every part 
of the engine gleaming from a thick coat of oil, I was creating a mess. 
And it wasn't the rear seal at all, or not so to the best of my 
knowledge. It was the little dipstick bellows that I had replaced only a 
few months ago. The bellows was hard and cracked and split. Clear 
evidence that I had overheated when I climbed the grade. I tried to clamp 
it up, but it was no use. Peregrine was still hemorrhaging oil. In six 
hours I had accomplished nothing. We drove back home, leaving the bus to 
sit and wait for a flatbed -- as soon as I could pay for one.

I wish that I had made the last 70 miles, but otherwise I have no 
regrets. I love driving the bus -- prefer it to driving any other 
vehicle. I like sleeping in the camper. I like the way that having a VW 
camper changes every aspect of the journey. And after all, the journey is 
the goal -- not the destination. Except when the destination is home.
