I have found that the relay can fill with water and rust badly. It may
rust to the point that the headlights will fail. Mine would not click
from high to low. The reason they fill up is that the windows leak and
it drips in the relay and fills it up. This is a deffinate possibility
if you have a 68-71. The fuse box was mounted up higher and the relay
is bigger and mounted right under the window.
The other thing that can happen is the headlight switch goes bad.
Someone else mentioned it and concider this a second.
Look for a common denominator, the switch, the relay, the power to the
switch.
Check to see if it will switch from high to low, it may help you
narrow it down.
If they both go out at the same time it is most likely not the fuse,
as there are two and they would not both fail and come back at the
same time, but it would not hurt to change them anyway, they are cheap.
Good Luck.
