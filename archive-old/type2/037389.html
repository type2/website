Subject: Parking lites - off, please...

OK, question #1::  Is there an easy way to wire the parking lights to the 
head lights, so that all my lights go off when I shut the key off??  This is 
the 'umpteenth time I left my parking lights on.

Question #2 (a little more difficult)::  How do I get the 'accessory' bus on 
my fuse box to work??  I would like to hear the radio without having power 
to the coil, PLUS I would need the radio to turn off when I take the key out 
(see question #1).  And the first guy who says 'wire the radio to the 
headlights' is going to get his head pushed in  ;-).
