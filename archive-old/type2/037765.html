Subject: electric bus in April National Geographic News

Has anyone else seen the new National Geographic News (kid's version of the
National Geographic)?  There's an article about the 1999 Tour de Sol from
Lake George, NY to Hartford, CT.  4th place in this competition of electric
powered vehicles went to a good looking 71 type II named Helios the Heron,
put together by a middle school in Lyndonville, VT.  In true type II form,
the solar panels are held down with bungee cords.  I'd like to know if
there's more info on this project.  My hat's off to them.
