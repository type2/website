Subject: Re: [T2] fuel filler pipe #2

Pat,

When I did my 78, I had the gas tank out.

I am asuming that you are talking about the tank to metal filler pipe 
hose? and not the filler to body hose?

Put all of the filler pipe pretty much together and lubed
up the inside of the rubber hose.  Hold on to the metal part
thru the round access hole and reach around with the other hand and
rotate the hose going on to the tank while pulling it toward the tank.


Put the tank end on first..once it is fairly secure then rotate correctly 
for the body to metal filler hose.  Gently pull the body part of the hose 
from the outside untill you get it pulled back thru enough to secure
with the round metal plate.

Hope I really understood the problem!

Cheers ,dave

&gt;      I have the fuel filler pipe out.  I got it out by cutting the old hose
&gt; off.  Now, I can't get the new pipe back together.  If I put the hose back
&gt; on the pipe before I place it in position, the pipe will not fit in the
&gt; access hole.  If I try to put just the pipe in then put the hose on, It will
&gt; not fit on.  This is a major PITA.  I am stuck.  Any ideas?
