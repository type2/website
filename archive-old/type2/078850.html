Subject: want to trade a bus?

Ok, everyone, my bestfriend just can't stand to see me drive Automopadamus 
around town. He says there is something about driving a VW and he wants one 
like there's no tomorrow.
     So, he has a late 80's Izuzu Trooper he is wanting to sell for around 
2500.00 But, here's another loop as well. He is also willing to trade even 
up for a Westy in Really Bad - Excellent condition. I guess if it's in super 
bad to average condition he would like 1000.00 on top of the trade so he can 
do what it takes to get it running well again.

   If anyone is interested you can email me: dewboy_at_hotmail_dot_com   and I'll 
let him know. We are in Port Townsend, WA. (seemingly the bus capital of the 
northwest).

    Carl
   '73 Westy    Automopadamus
    Port Townsend, WA.

                  Ask for no security, ask for no guarantees,
                  there never was such an animal. And even if
                  there was it would be related to the great sloth
                  which hangs upside down all day, every day, wasting
                  its life away. To hell with that. Shake the
                  tree and knock the sloth down on his ass.
                      (IMAGINE THE ADVENTURE)
