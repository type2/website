Grey market is sort of an open legal smuggling, say someone lives in
Germany, a serviceman for example, they buy a VW panel van then get
transfered back to the USA, if they have owned the car for a certain
period (6 months I think) then it is considered personal property and can
be brought back to the USA, (there are a few safety type requirements) it
is legally imported, just not by Volkswagen.

I did it when I was in the service, that was how I got my 1500S motor into
the USA.
