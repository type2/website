Subject: Re: [T2] Electric Fuel Pump, YES or NO?

Just remember the stock fuel pump limits free flow of fuel from the tank to
the carby, but most electric pumps don't. This can lead to the fuel tank
slowly draining through the carby, especially if the bus is parked nose up.
Just something to be aware of.
This situation is worse on type 4 motors and type 1 also.
