    Under the heading of &quot;I rather be lucky than good&quot;, check this out:  I 
posted a couple of weeks ago about trying to dye my original mustard curtains 
back into shape, and the general consensus was fuggeddaboudit.  So, I spend 
an afternoon on the phone with resto shops and fabric warehouses trying to 
find something close to the original fabric to make a new set.  A few vendors 
sort of knew what I needed, but nobody had anything close.  I finally decide 
to go buy something/anything in the same general color and just use that.  
The first place I try sez &quot;nah, we don't have anything like that, but you can 
check out the bulk upholstery stuff in the back if you want.&quot;  In plain sight 
is a bolt of EXACTLY what I want.  I bought the whole roll, and have already 
made my new set.  There is enough left to do at least one, maybe two more 
sets.  I'm asking $25 to cover part of my expense, with the understanding 
that if there is enough left over for another set to pass it on to any other 
listmember that might need it.  THIS IS THE REAL STUFF, in all its 
burlap-sack glory.  If I get more that a few responses, I'm going to randomly 
select a recipient.  Thanks for reading!
