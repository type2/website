I had quite the problem in past with this dilema. Unless the engine is out of 
the bus, it's a PITA to work with... finally I went to Ace Hardware and got 
couple of &quot;molly bolt&quot; type things. It's a steel sleeve containing a bolt 
with a tapered aluminum end ... as you tighten the bolt on the top it slowly 
pulls the tapered end up the sleeve and you are plugged.  It won't come out, 
just have to make sure you cut around it slightly to get your tin out and in 
... aloha
