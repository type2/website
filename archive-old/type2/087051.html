hmmm, you seem to have a winner here,  I would check (and you may have)

.  presure regulator could be set too high or malfunctioning
.  restriction in the return fuel line back to the tank
.  sticking injectors (staying open)

I would remove one injector trigger wire at a time to maybe pinpoint the
cyl that is putting out too much gas.

.  intake valve staying open too long (not likely)
 
good luck

&gt; Hello Friends,
&gt; I'm still trying get my &quot;78 Westy running well.
&gt; 
&gt; The fuel injection STILL goes full rich (fuel dripping out of the manifolds!)and stalls or won't start in the first place.  The new AVP motor runs well when it runs.  I think I've checked everything as per the VW FI trouble shooting manual, but obviously I've missed something.
&gt; 
&gt; I just checked the head temp. sender again---3.5K ohms at slightly colder than normal temperature.  I disconnected the cold start valve by running the fuel line around it (no fuel to cold start valve).  When cranking no fuel comes out the vacuum port on the fuel pressure regulator.  The flap on the air mass sensor seems free (I checked the resistance on the terminals of the air mass sensor previously--they seemed alright.  I tried a different FI computer (thanks again Karl). That didn't help.  What in god's name is pumping all that fuel through the injectors on and off??????
&gt; 
&gt; The only thing which seems to help is disconnecting the computer and leaving it sit for a day or two.  Then it usually starts right up and runs fine for a while.  Lately it goes fine for 6-8 miles and goes full rich and dies.
&gt; 
&gt; The not so local VW guy and the very not so local VW dealer have gotten it to run for periods but not consistantly.  What am I missing here?
&gt; 
&gt; Any further help would be greatly appreciated as were the good leads I've already gotten from the list.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks for any help in advance.
&gt; 
&gt; Drew
