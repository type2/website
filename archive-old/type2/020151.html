Subject: Water Tank Cap

Hi Ed and List
    I made a cap for my '73s water tank using a trreaded plastic ring
from a kit made to repair the trap under a sink. I found a chrome disk,
that I believe is part of a shower drain stopper, then glued it into the
ring using food grade silicon. Fits great, and looks nice.

Rob
