Subject: Re: [T2] AIRS rescue---Engine runs fine, but dies when the
  engine is  under load.

Mike/Erin

The secret here is warm vs. cool and uphill vs. flat.

I would be willing to bet a lot of money that there is nothing wrong with 
the clutch.

The other half is what someone already mentioned...gas delivery problems.

You have something in the tank that is fine on flat, but bad on 
uphill...the amount of gas in the tank may have a bearing on it also.

As you said, after fiddling around(and cooling off) you went up the same 
hill it died on and more, before camping for the night.

Soooooo, the other half of the equation is that if it cools off, you are 
fine....which goes to the coil problem that someone already mentioned.

Uphill(under load) means more power needed from coil...works fine when 
cool, but once it gets warmed up, then....poof!  Cools off again and you 
are fine.  If you don't get a new coil soon, then next time it happens, 
see how it feels and try coooling it off with some water/ice in a plastic 
bag and then try the same hill.

Cheers, dave

&gt; Got an A.I.R.S. rescue here.  We're in north Seattle, about a mile east
&gt; of greenlake.  Bus is in front of my house.  Here's her writeup:

&gt; replaced the one plug wire, and again I get about a half hour of happy
&gt; driving before she starts the cutting out on hills trick again, trying
&gt; to get up one steep hill she coughed until she quit. I stopped for
&gt; probably two or two and half hours while I fiddled about, found and
&gt; sealed up the vaccuum leak, and she went happily up the same hill she
&gt; died on earlier plus a few more steep hills and we camped for the night.




&gt; Any thoughts? Thanks in advance for any insights.
