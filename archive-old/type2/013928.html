&gt; &gt;&gt;many distributors retard the #3 spark to keep that cylinder cool. The 
&gt; &gt;&gt;spark is probably arriving too late for #3 to contribute to idle power, 
&gt; &gt;&gt;although it is probably firing.  When the distributor advances, #3 will 
&gt; &gt;&gt;take up its share of the load. &lt;&lt;
&gt; 
&gt; If this is true, then if the distributor drive is 180 degrees off, as 
&gt; someone posted earlier today, will it then be retarding #1 instead?

Maybe, maybe not.  If the rotor is pointing at #1 (notch on distributor body) when #1 is in firing position, then #3 will still be retarded (if the 
distributor is designed that way)

It's relatively easy to check this.  If the points are static timed to open at, say, 7.5 degrees BTDC, and you rotate the engine 360 degrees 
(firing position for #3) and note that the points open at 5 degrees BTDC, then the distributor is oriented correctly to retard #3, regardless of 
the distributor drive gear orientation.  If, however, the points open at 10 degrees BTDC after rotating the engine 360 degrees then the 
distributor is installed wrong.  Rotate the distributor body 180 degrees and criss-cross the wires on the cap to set things right.

&gt; This 
&gt; would seem like a good reason to rotate the drive rather than move the plug 
&gt; wires.  My camper's previous owner installed the drive backward so the first 
&gt; thing I ever did to an acvw was pop out the drive.  If a total newbie like 
&gt; me with brand new metric tools can do it, any one can.  =)

Good idea.  Even though there is no mechanical reason why a 009 distributor cannot work regardless of the distributor drive orientation, I 
still prefer to set them as the factory intended, as a courtesy to the next poor guy who has to work on the engine if nothing else!

&gt; On another note, can a vacuum advance distributor even work 180 degress out 
&gt; or will the canister hit?  I wonder if this is why the p.o threw away my 
&gt; camper's original vacuum advance distributor and bought the 009.

That's a good theory.  the canister will hit if the drive is out.  That's why there's a &quot;right&quot; way to set the drive.
