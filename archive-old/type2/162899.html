Subject: re: claims for electric car

	The 'Tesla' was discussed on BBC World Service ca.30 h ago. 
No doubt some written or audio file on this coverage is on the BBC 
website.
	The BBC reporter claimed to have experienced 0 - 60 mph in 
4.0 s (in accord with the firm's claims), but only 130 mph.  The 
price is projected as $100,000.   Batteries are stated to be 'lithium 
ion'.
