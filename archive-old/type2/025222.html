Brian,

Does your '71 not have composite brakes?  The drums are VERY EASY to take
off on 1971 and later rear.  YOu do NOT need to remove the 46mm nut.

'71 loaf

Also, I'm going to think about trying to fix the hand brake cables myself.
Do I really need a specially modified five-foot-long length of steel pipe
in order to get the rear brake drums off?
