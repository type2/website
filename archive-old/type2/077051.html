Hi Trudell, and welcome.

Now honestly, why'd you buy an old car if you didn't want to tinker with it?
That's mostly what's fun about these things.  You labor over the carbs till
it idles nice, then stand back and tell yourself what a clever fellow you
are.

The nice thing about old VWs is that they are relatively easy to fix and
maintain, and most of the parts are easy to find and fairly cheap.  They run
pretty reliably after you work through the bugs they come to you with, so
you shouldn't have major disasters every 2000 miles, but having intimate
contact with the mechanicals is an unavoidable part of the fun.

Recommend you take a read through Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance,
for which you can search on line.

Read the shop manuals the the Type2_dot_com library articles, and ask lots of
questions.  That old bus will give you a lot of happiness.

Regards,

Grant
