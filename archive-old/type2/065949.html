Ok, I'll add my .02 as well.  Early this thread, some EC dude wanted to
add a Catalytic converter to his ride.  The problem with just hanging one
on is that these are part of a system -- they are there to lower the ignition
temperature of the HC/NO/CO + O2 in the exhaust via a platinum (or other
metal, maybe rhodium?) catalyst.  You need the excess O2 in the exhaust do
accomplish this.  Some cars burn really lean mixtures to get this, others
have a pump to force outside air into the stream.  Some have both.

If I was still driving my '57, I'd think about putting in a late typeIV with
all the fittings, preferably a Vanagon California version that has the lamda
sensor (O2 sensor) feedback mechanism.

It may help to just hang a cat on an old car, but I suspect it might not help
very much, and the cat might get *really* hot, burning the dirty exhuast.

There are always people that remove bits of their cars (I saw a post today
about sliding door bits).  VW's were cheap.  This is not rocket science.  If
VW ever thought they could build a car that could run without some widget
they would have saved big money by leaving it out.  The thermostat on the
engine is a good example.  This, and all them little flaps were expensive
to put on.  We're talking *millions* here that could have been saved.  It
it is on the car to start with, there is good reason -- VW was too cheap to
throw on extraneous bits.

Of course, sometimes the reasons were to satisfy anal regulations...
