Unless you're in Memphis, TN, in which case, the local dealer, Gossett VW won't even try to look up parts for an early bus. No kidding! They brush you aside and send you toward the door. 

Okay, I should'a saved this for Friday, but I *really* hate how VWoA brags about being supportive of old car restorers in the rags and then flips me the bird everytime I walk in the door.

Okay, okay, I'll take it to chat. Sorry. Joe
