Subject: RE: [T2] Valve Adjustment

I'm actually replacing the old distributor with a new SVDA BRUCK vacuum
advance from CIP1.  At this point I may be having some difficulty seeding the
new distributor into the case.  I positioned the rubber sleeve protector onto
the new distirubor.  When I position the distributor into the case it appears
to not sit flush.  And when I turn the crankshaft pully the distributor rotor
does not move.  When I have the distributor seeded correctly I'll pickup your
instructions.  Thanks again!

&gt; Ok, then most everything I wrote should apply - althought I don't know &gt; if
that model has an 009 or vacuum advance distributor. Does the &gt; distributor
have a vacuum can on the side of it like this:&gt; &gt;
