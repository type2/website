Subject: RE: Relays - again

I looked at the schematic of the Bosch WR-1 and saw that Bosch did not use 
the 87a terminal.

I looked at the bottom of a Bosch WR-1 relay I have as a spare, and it shows 
TWO 87 terminals (no schematic on the relay, though.)

Is this a DPST relay, just what I was looking for to power twin fog lamps??

Not bad, for the price----

BTW, I discovered that although you can measure the 12Volts DC coming from a 
AC/DC converter by sticking a multimeter on the output end, that if you try 
to get am amp/current reading on a rated 2 AMP converter the same way, 
WITHOUT some load on the system, that you WILL burn the converter out in 
less than 2 seconds.  Man, that needle jumped real high, for a real short 
period!!

And if you do the same thing to a second AC/DC 12V 2 amp converter, you will 
burn that up, too.

But I bet it will work on a third AC/DC 12V 2 amp converter, because I heard 
that the third time is the charm.
