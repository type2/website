  I'm trying to install a stereo into my roommate's '71 bus.  I have 
pounded, ground, and otherwise jammed the stereo into the dash, but I am 
having problems with the wiring.  Could someone tell me what I should 
connect the &quot;Constant power&quot; and &quot;Ignition/power&quot; wires to?

  Thanks,

  Brian
