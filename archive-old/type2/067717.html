&gt;&gt;uhhhhhhhhhhh............. did anyone ELSE get this? I looked, and I
&gt;&gt;couldn't see a VW ANYWHERE on her page. They also seemed puzzled when I
&gt;&gt;said &quot;split the case and alignbore it for me&quot; in response to &quot;We want to
&gt;&gt;do anything you ask to make you happy!&quot; Knew it wuz too good to be
&gt;&gt;true.....
