Subject: [T2] 78 Westy Delux for sale cheap (Jim, take a look)

Hey all,
  I had a guy contact me about his 78 Westy. He wanted me to fix it for him,
but he does not have 2 nickels to rub together, so he decided to sell it. 
First the good:
It has a complete Westy interior including the sink, stove, fridge, pop-top bed
and all. It has the propane tank, he said it works too. 
It has a Gas heater (BA6?) original
It has the factory VDO Clock in dash. 
Chrome bumpers front and rear, with rubber impact strip
Body is straight(mostly)
Manual trans
Interior is good except for the front seat.
There is very, very little rust. This bus is very solid.
The Bad:
The engine is in a box or two, but complete minus both heads. It still has all
the FI stuff. I does have an aftermarket exhaust.
The nose has some minor damage, but has some bondo.
It was brown, now OD green and white
It has sat for a few years (tags say 99)
Interior is brown, with that green plaid.
There is no childs cot or stool, but otherwise complete.

This is an exelent Westy if you can put an engine into it.
Jim, this is nicer than the one I found for Landon. Give me a call.
I told the guy it would be worth between $3-500 because it is so nice and has
the gas heater, clock, and is straight.
If I had no found this Vanagon Westy, I would be getting it. 
Call me after 3pm at (360)400-0935 or write back and I will pass on the info.
