Subject: Re: [T2] Alternator functioning?

Larry:

The light should go out.  Did you remember to attach the wire on the alternator that goes to the dash light?  Also, some alternators need to have a wire attached from the body of the alternator to the Bus chassis.  Another thing to look at is the belt.  If it's too loose, it may not spin the alternator fast enough at low RPM.

I'm reusing the
&gt;alternator that was in it before and when I started it up the light didn't
&gt;go out.  &gt;Question: Is it normal for a system converted to an alternator to behave
&gt;this way or should the light be out at all speeds?
