&gt;Here's a question? Should I re do my seats or buy new one to put in? Any

Barber chairs, antique. Red velvet. With the foot pedal up &amp; down pumping
hydraulic things. Over the engine deck put two of those big helmet half-egg
hair dryers. Scatter well-thumbed Cosmospolitans around. Find some
passengers who know what an esthetician is about. Everyone should smoke
cigarettes. If anyone will consent to ride with you tip him two dollars.
