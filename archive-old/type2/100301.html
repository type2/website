Subject: Re: [T2] real bodywork estimate

While we're on the topic,

I would like to know if anybody can point me to a reputable VW bodywork 
expert near me.  I'm pretty isolated here in Boise Idaho.  Anywhere here or 
in Utah that is top-notch at restorative body panel R&amp;R is who I'm seeking.  
Thanks-in-advance(PLEEEEEEEEASE)

	Eron

P.S.  Perhaps we could assimilate a listing of such places and post them on 
the Type-2 website(please don't fry me if it already exists)

Hey everyone,
  I was wondering what kind of price I am looking at to get quality
bodywork done on a bus.  I have a 69 which needs;
1. Both quarters in front of rear wheels replaced
2. New battery tray welded in, as well as a small piece of the wheel
   arch in front of the tray
3. A little work over drivers side dogleg
4. At least one rear corner
5. Small bit of rust beginning at windshield
6. one small hole under slider
7. Rust treatment in a few areas
8. removal of parking lot dings, and bondo using as little filler as
   possible.
I want to essentially do a restoration on the outside of the body
and not skimp on quality.  This bus is from West Texas and has only
been up here in Vermont a short time.  She is solid and deserves the
effort.
Also if anyone knows someone in the New England area who specializes
in Vw bodywork, could you let me know?   Thanks    BG
