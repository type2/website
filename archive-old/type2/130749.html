Subject: Re: [T2] AIRS UPDATES: (Was Re: [T2] Hi all - long)

&gt; Is there a way that the list can be verified? 

I would be willing to call all the numbers in my area code (206 -
Seattle Washington area) and Verify numbers if an AIRS official or
whatnot were to ask me to (otherwise I would have no clue as to what
to do with my findings). Theirs bound to be at least one person per
area code that would be willing to call around.
