Subject: points burned up

I just heard that letting a bus sit with the ignition switch on, but
without the engine running (listening to the radio, etc) can burn up your
points!?

Yes it will .  Unless you disconnect the wires to the distributor while you
are parked(thats what I do)  

Just read your copy of Muir it explains how to replace points pretty good

Peace
