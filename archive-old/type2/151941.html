of course you can use impact sockets for regular wrenches...  I have
certain key sockets (13,15,17,19mm) as impact sockets...also most impact
sockets seem to be 6 sided rather than 12 sided so less likely to round
off a nut.   would have all impact sockets except for the price.  of
course when I fire up the air compressor I need the impact sockets.
