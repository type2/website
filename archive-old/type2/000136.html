Volks,
 Got my new rebuild in and I think Ive got most of the coil wires figured 
out. Fired it up and it idles way too high, Oil PSI gauge will not come up , 
oil light goes out , took oil psi sensor off and had oil pumping. So ive got 
oil psi, enough I dont know, maybe if I let it run for more than 3-4 secs Id 
see pressure. Pulled the valve cover on one side and it was still dry, does 
not have hydraulic  lifters and i assume it takes a while to pass thru the 
tubes to lifters. ( lifter tubes were not plugged when I installed).
 When I crank it and it has brand new Battery it turns over rough like weak 
battery or too much compressiuon and then it will start to turn pretty good 
and fires and then Idles and Im guessing goes well over 3,000 rpm and is a 
little rough.  It ran and idled b4 I tore down and Ive done noting other than 
do a rebuild, which I guess is everthing. Id like to get idle down and let 
run to break in, any ideas on high idle?  Timing or carb or????
 Sorry Im rambling, but im a little stuck and dont want to blow it b4 i have 
a chance to  drive once around the block..
