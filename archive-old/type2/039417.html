I see the beginnings of confusion here! ...or at least the opportunity!!

There are at least two &quot;Old Volks Homes&quot; that I know of. One is &quot;Old Volks
Home of Lake Havasu&quot; or something like that--the proprietor is &quot;Ronnie
..something&quot;. The other, which was at oldvolkshome_dot_com was run by another
guy who dropped out of site a little over a year ago...and I'm embarassed
that I can't remember his name, but it wasn't 'Ron.' Maybe I haven't had
enough coffee yet...or maybe it's because I'm trying to learn relearn Perl
and learn Linux and Bash all at the same time.

Anyway, please tread lightly on this topic as there are some significant
opportunities for confusion rising up here. I don't think anyone wants to
hang innocent vendors.

Thanks! Joe

&gt;I really do try not to be negative - especially in a public forum but I
&gt;think this needs to be said about Ron and Old volks home.
