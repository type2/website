I wanted to thank everybody for the help. There were a lot of suggestions
and all were tried but it does not appear the engine is coming away from
the transaxle by any non-invasive means.

There was one oblique flame for cross-posting all this but I think it is
appropriate, this could happen as well in my split as my early bay. I
realize cross-posting is a wholesale problem but if you have a wholesale
complaint then take it up with the appropriate administrator, of which he I
am not. 8)

One person said he had had the same thing happen and the engine came loose
after two hours of hauling and sweating and bouncing. I gave it an hour to
no avail. Several people said to put it in gear, turn the crank and haul on
it. That didn't work insofar as I could do it myself. Several people
suggested that a crucial bolt has not been removed or the throttle cable is
still attached and so forth. Oh how I wish. 8)

Anyway the Cruise Director has jury duty this week, I spent the day
watching our kids, got to the bus a little tonight, started pulling the
CVs. I'll lower the engine and trans, have them out where I can see, have
another go with wedges. If that doesn't work we'll take the differential
out, remove the shaft and go from there.

Blake: there is no disgrace in walking away from a situation that gives you
no reward. There may come a time when the data available TO YOU, in spite
of what everybody else says, indicates that there is no profit in wasting
time on these things. You've had enough time and enough engines to form an
intelligent opinion and I know from witnessing that you are very, very
bright. So decide and be at peace. 8)

Me, I'm gonna drop my whole drivetrain on the ground and beat on it with
wedges and hammers. =^ )
