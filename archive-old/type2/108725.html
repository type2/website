Subject: Re: [T2] VW Hippie Bashing

&gt; No, nothing like it before or since. (Asbestos suit on).

I don't see vast herds of bison returning any time soon, either. It's a new
day, and another page has turned. Dig it for what it is, when it is. The
hippie thing was a brief, ephemeral dream, born from the illusions and
seekings of youth and a puff of pot smoke. It seemed beautiful, but like
many beautiful things, it was a mirage without much substance. It did and
still does cast long shadows over our society. I think it had it's dark
side, too. People like Einhorn and Manson and the Simbianese Liberation Army
came out of this brief social phenomena.

Whatever was beautiful came from within us and was only made possible
because we were provided a pretty good world by our parents' generation. We
saw the world through young eyes, and were arguably the best provided for
generation yet. Most of us never went hungry or worked long days on farms or
factories. We were raised on Disney, cartoons and fairy tales...small wonder
that we later dreamed our own world into existance. But it was a world that
we could not sustain. Most of us eventually grew up and joined the ratrace.

Vietnam was a disaster, but the threat of Marxism was real (Capitalism and
Marxism have been at each others' throats since the dawn of the industrial
age, approx 100 years ago). The seeds of Marxist ideology and socialist
methodology are embedded in our society and government now and it is
socialist, not &quot;fascist&quot; forces that are breaching the trust with the people
now. Marxist ideology and global socialist ambitions a good part of why we
had to go to war recently. There are strong indications that international
and domestic terrorist and anarchist movements as well as anti-capitalist
propaganda are all underwritten by a pro-socialist world community and both
former and present communist countries and their leaders (there is nothing
&quot;former&quot; about it and there is nothing &quot;dead&quot; about communism.. It's just
&quot;playing 'possum&quot;!) They are, in my view, using &quot;socially progressive&quot;
causes and anarchism/terrorism to advance their own interests and
competitive positions in controlling as much of the world economy and
politics as possible (I have put no small amount of research into these
matters, btw, and know whereof I speak).

I was an ardent hippie wannabe and did a lot of the typical hippie stuff. I
wanted to run a crash pad. I seriously wanted to run away at 16 to go to
Haight-Ashbury, but wisely decided to wait until I was graduated to leave
home. In those two brief years, the Haight-Ashbury district (the very Mecca
of hippiedom), fell apart. I went there the summer after I graduated, and it
was dismal and ugly, inhabited by a few straggling lowlifes and druggies.
The flower children were gone. A lot of them OD'd. A lot more went home or
went back to the land and started the whole &quot;Mother Earth&quot; thing. Some got
involved in born-again Christian and other religious cults. I suspect that
most of us went back to figuring out what to do with our lives and how to
make a living. I started a family and a carreer, and I figured out that real
life was pretty good after all. I found out that drugs were incompatible
with real life.

(I suspect that the moderator will rein things back in pretty soon, here.)

All in all, it was a fun time to be young, and fun to revisit via music, the
Grateful Dead concerts, Rainbow Tribe gatherings, and so on. When I'm in my
VW bus, listening to one of the oldie-but-goodie stations with some select
60's music on the radio, in my mind I am young again. It's great! Even
working on my bus can put me into a good groove. But sooner or later we have
to come back down to reality. if you cannot make the dream work on a
day-to-day basis, then keep it in the context of a weekend thing or a fond
memory. For most of us, it doesn't make much of a way of life.
