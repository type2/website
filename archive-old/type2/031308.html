&gt; &gt; I had the same problem this summer. What would make a pilot bearing fail so
&gt; &gt; completely? 
&gt; 
&gt; The usual suspect... lack of lubrication.  Every time you have the engine
&gt; out, you have to lay a lump of grease in there.  While it is not suficient

or if your van can accept it use the automatic tranny starter, will fit in
some manual tranny's but maybe not all.  it is self supported and has no
pilot bearing at all.

bonus is that it is a more powerful starter
