Listers,

I just replaced the engine in my 79 Camper (2L FI). The engine I put in leaks oil when running. The oil is dripping down from the oil filter. I have changed the oil filter (and oil ...) and made sure that the oil filter is screwed on tight. 

This raises two questions:
1. What is the likely source of my leak - oil cooler, oil pressure sensor, or something else ?
2. Can I take off the fan housing with the engine still in the car?

Also, I just parted out a 79 bus. I have everything except engine, bumpers, steering box, and wiper motor, including a rust and dent free nose panel (including windshield frame), a 5-rail tranny and a solid front axle beam. If you need any parts let me know. I am located in Maryland.

For my 79 camper I need a passenger's side heat exchanger ('79), and a 72-74 muffler, or a 79 federal muffler, cat and elbow (I have a solid cross pipe).

For my 74 Camper back in Germany, I need the bright orange door covers that go with the orange plaid interior and an underfloor propane heater (the one that is accessible through a trap door in the cargo floor).

Cheers,
Marcus
