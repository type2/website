Subject: Wiring for stock Isolator

I just got my hands on a stock battery isolator from a Campmobile Deluxe
that I would like to install in my Westy.  Does anyone know how this was
wired up stock?  I'm particularly curious about what was coming off of the
secondary battery and what was fed off of the main battery.  From what I
know, the main battery is used for starting only and everything else is
coming off of the secondary battery.  If I'm wrong with this, let me know.

Any help would be greatly appreciated,

Ted Kitch
