Subject: Re: To use Thermostat or not?

&gt;hey now,
&gt;
&gt;in the never ending rebuild of rumba, i now gotta decide to reinstall the
&gt;thermostat device which some previous owner took off the van. any comments?
&gt;i've heard that it's good to have it, and that it's good not to have it.
&gt;
&gt;thanks,
&gt;

Howdy Jonathan,

How did those heater boxes work out?

With respect to your thermostat - What is the enemy of your air cooled VW
engine? - HEAT!!  Considering the simplicity of the device and it's
installation why not use it?

Enough said, IMHO.
