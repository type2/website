Subject: RE: [VB] jetting solex 40's

I don't remember off the top of my head, but when I pull the engine out of
the DD i'll check the jets, My Kadrons are on their third engine (1776) and
will be installed on their 4th soon.

Morning all!
Anyone running/ever ran a pair of Solex 40's on a 1776 with mild cam and 
extractor care to share their jetting setting (the 'correct' of course)?
