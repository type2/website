&gt; But I do want to address something -- an attitude, an ethic -- the pops

&gt; 
&gt; &gt;without being stranded yet... I'm sure I'll have my day, but thats part of
&gt; &gt;the adventure.
&gt; 
&gt; Okay, sure. That's part of YOUR adventure. You didn't mention whether you 
&gt; share this adventure with any one else.

My girlfriend, and she shares my belief that the best attitude to have is
that everything is an adventure... people that cannot tolerate unexpected
changes in plan and blow a gasket when things dont go their way arent
people i tend to spend time with too much....

&gt; My experience, and that of many on this list including Jay, who started 
&gt; this thread, is that significant others, spouses, and children don't 
&gt; necessarily see being stranded as an adventure. Neither do employers and 
&gt; co-workers who have to take up the slack. Neither do students if you are 
&gt; a teacher or teachers if you are a student. Clients don't share the 
&gt; adventure. Other motorists on the road don't share the adventure.

IMHO life is unpredictable and no matter how you choose to convey yourself
from one point to another all contingencies cannot be planned for, all
problems cannot be forseen.  Life is dynamic and requires adaptability at
times.  I would not set out on any trip expecting that all will go
perfectly.

&gt; With proper maintenance, preventative maintenance, and attention to 
&gt; detail, a Volkswagen bus can be the most reliable vehicle on the road 
&gt; today. This costs some money, but surprisingly little compared to what it 
&gt; costs to keep Lexuses and Fords and Volvos reliable.
&gt; 
&gt; Sadly, however, there is an ingrained belief -- almost a faith -- that 
&gt; breaking down in a bus is a certainty. If not today, then next week. Or 
&gt; next year. I don't know where this comes from; maybe it is a 
&gt; characteristic of bus owners. Maybe it is because VWs, alone of all the 
&gt; vehicles on the road, have a stoner-style &quot;idiot book&quot; that is sold in 
&gt; virtually every bookstore.

Mecvhanical things break down.  I take every precaution i can, but i do
not expect that they will always perform as expected.  If something
unforseen occurs and one does break down, spares for busses can be harder
to find than for a ford escort... that has to be accounted for.  I carry
many spares, too many by some peoples rationale, but there are very few
problems with my bus that i couldnt fix on the side of the road in an hour
or two.

I do not believe busses will let you down, i believe all mechanical things
will let you down.  I like my bus because if it does break i have a really
good chance of fixing it myself and quickly.

I guess i disagree with the attitude that man is so omnitient that he can
predict everything in a complex mechanical system.  We are not gods, we
are human and fallible.  If you are an infallible god, hats are off.  I
prefer to be human.

peas,

Steve
