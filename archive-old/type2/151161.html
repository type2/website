Subject: Re: [T2] cargo door

Mine was doing something similar a few months ago -
it just seemed to want to 'lock' before the door
was fully closed, then rattle ...

Cleaning and lubricating the mechanism did the trick 
for me.

&amp;gt; Hey, Guys (and Gals), I'm having trouble with my  Cargo door.  I've adjusted the front catch before but now it is  latching before the rear of the door settles into the closed  position.  I have to hold one hand on the back and push to get it  to seat.  I don't see any adjustment on the rear mechanism.   Anybody know how to adjust it or have I bent something.   Thanks...KR
