Subject: Indicator/turn signal problem.

My indicators have stopped working overnight.
The hazard lights work fine though.

When I turn the indicator stalk, the dash constantly displays both green
arrows.
I don't hear any 'tick/click' from the flasher unit.

Do both the hazard and the indicator circuits use the same flasher unit and
relay?

I was told the relay for the indicators was in-built into the shared flasher
unit, and the hazard switch contains it's own relay. True?

Tia,
