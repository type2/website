Subject: Inuvik radio spot#1:CBC Morningside

Inuvik Trek on CBC Radio &quot;Morningside&quot;
Aired nationally in Canada 09:20 AM July 22, 1996
Host: Shelagh Rogers
Guest: Christa Ovenell, originator of 1996 Inuvik VW Bus Trek

Shelagh Rogers: I'm Shelagh Rogers, you're listening to Morningside on
     CBC Radio.  People who own Volkswagen buses think the vehicles are
     pretty darn special, including Christa Ovenell.  This morning she
     and her husband are setting off in a convoy of 13 VW buses on their
     way from Vancouver to Inuvik and Christa Ovenell is in our
     Vancouver studio.  Christa, good morning!

Christa Ovenell: Good morning, Shelagh!

SR:  What is it about the VW minivan--

CO:  Oh!  No, no, no, it's not a minivan, it's a bus!

SR:  It's a bus!  Okay...

CO:  Well, those new ones are kind of minivans.  Well, picture this: you
     can go anywhere that a tent can go, but you always have your own
     bed!  You can... sleep in it, you can eat in it, you can wash in
     it, you can... you can *do* your wash in it, you can brush your
     teeth in it, you can do really whatever you want--and you can go
     anywhere.  The old ones have really high clearance.  We've actually
     rescued people on 4 x 4 roads that were in proper 4 x 4s that got
     stuck.  And we've just sort of plodded our way through.

SR:  As I recall, one of the selling features of the mini--of, of the
     *bus* that is, way back then was that you could do your own
     repairs, right?  It comes with a really extensive kit, and good
     instructions?

CO:  Well, exactly.  I think that's sort of after-market, but a fellow
     called John Muir wrote a book called &quot;The Compleat Idiot's Guide to
     Keeping Your Volkswagen Alive&quot; and we call him &quot;St. Muir&quot;
     because--

SR:  (laughs)

CO:  he really is--he's just done everything.  I mean *I've* even
     learned how to adjust valves and change oil and all sorts of sort
     of quick fix-it, dust-tape and chewing gum kind of solutions.  And
     you can really go anywhere.  When you're in well-populated areas--
     and when you're in the West, especially--you don't have much
     problem finding parts.  I think when we get up North it might be--
     it's more pick-up country up there.

SR:  Christa, what's yours like?

CO:  Ours is *beautiful,* Shelagh!

SR:  (Laughs)  Of *course* it is!

CO:  (Laughs)  It's a 1976 mango colour, which, okay, that's sort of
     orange, or sort of yellow, depending on whether you're speaking to
     me or my husband.  It's in pretty good shape, it started it's life
     in Boston, or somewhere in Massachusetts, and it's got a fair bit
     of rust.  A lot of the California buses that are with us they're
     just beautiful pristine even though some of them might be older.
     But inside it's really clean and it's got an ice box and after-
     market porta-potti, and a sink with running water, um... a two-
     burner coleman stove--we have everything you could need!  A swivel
     seat... it's wonderful!

SR:  Is it mango on the inside too?

CO:  Well, no, it's *better!*  It's this fabulous plaid green, orangey,
     [Shelagh laughing] kind of... thing.  And it's got orange or mango
     coloured curtains, and so, it's always kind of sunny and cheery-
     looking inside.

SR:  Do you have a shag rug too?

CO:  Oh, no!  It's, it's better.  It's kind of a--

SR:    --I can't imagine!

CO:  --an indoor/outdoor kind of greeny, *black* sort of... thing. It
really just picks out all the fabulous colours.  [laughs...]

SR:    Do you have a story about getting a VW bus?

CO:  Well, I do, I guess I do.  My husband and I were just finished
     university--both of us, finally--and we had both finally gotten
     jobs, and we were working, and making enough money.  I mean we had
     paid off our debts--our university debts--and we were doing pretty
     well, we thought.  Then one day we were driving up to visit my dad
     in the interior of B.C. and I just had a momentary lapse of all
     concentration and I literally drove off the road!  And I went sort
     of end over end down a little embankment, and *totalled* the car we
     were driving, just totalled it.  And we came to a stop and we kind
     of looked at each other and undid our seatbelts and got out, and we
     thought right then, &quot;Wait a minute!  What are we doing?&quot;  No kids,
     lots of money that could be potential savings for a potential
     trip...  And right there the idea was born, and we bought it just a
     few months later in September of '94, and in January, January first
     of '95 we took off on a three month tour that took us from here to
     basically Guatemala up to Prince Edward Island, and back home
     again.

SR:  And you were were fine, no break-downs?

CO: Um, our solenoid went, and um--

SR:  What's that?

CO:  That's sort of part of the starter motor, and (heh) we uh, sort of
     had to... push-start it all the way home because we were running
     out of money at that point.

SR:  [Laughing...]

CO:  But it's a fabulous way to meet people!  You see, people in
     Volkwagen campers all love each other--it's just sort of automatic
     --and people who don't have Volkwagen campers either want one or
     used to have one, and so they're always willing to give you a push
     or give you gas or just talk about your bus!

SR:  Tell me about your trip to Inuvik.  How did this come about?

CO:  Um, well no great car crashes for this one.  But we basically got
     home--I started work again, my husband was unemployed for a bit,
     and um, boy, I got wanderlust really quickly!  So we started
     looking at places to go.  And being a Canadian, I guess there's
     that lure of the North, and I thought &quot;how far north can we go?&quot;
     And we wanted to stay in Canada.  The exchange is pretty extreme,
     and we haven't done a lot of travelling north--we've gone across
     the country back and forth a couple of times--but we've never done
     it, so I just said, &quot;Hey!  How about Inuvik?&quot;  I was sort of a
     place on a map.  And Tobin said, &quot;Okay, sure--

SR:  This is your husband?

CO:  This is my husband.  Before we even bought the bus we had hooked up
     with some people on the internet--this is actually what the
     internet is for, not crazy buying schemes or anything like that
     it's for meeting people who own Volkswagen buses--and he hooked up
     with people, and he said, &quot;Hey, guess what we're doing next year!&quot;
     And someone immediately wrote back--a guy named Ron wrote back and
     said, &quot;CAN I COME?&quot;  And [laughs] we said, &quot;Well, uh, okay.&quot;  And
     then about six other people wrote back and then we thought, &quot;Well,
     what are we doing?  Maybe we should organize this!&quot;  So we did!
     And last night twelve people in campers showed up from as far away
     as *Puerto Rico,* um--

SR:  Wow...

CO:  --Texas, California, Washington, Vancouver Island, um... just about
     everywhere.  We've got people meeting us on the trip, from Oshawa
     Ontario, and up in I think we've got some people from Yellowknife,
     and a couple people in Inuvik that'll join us up there--actually I
     think there's two Volkswagen owners--Volkswagen *bus* owners--in
     Inuvik, and we've already--through the internet--met them!

SR:  Did they sleep in their campers?

CO:  Well, yes, all of them except a young girl Vivian who slept on our
     couch--a little twelve-year-old girl--her parents have come with
     their yougest and her, and they left their oldest at home, and
     we've got two other kids on the trip, a three- and five-year-old,
     and we've got I couple people look like they *could* be retired...
     And a lot of them are our age, which is about 25, 30, and we've got
     Volkswagen fix-it guys--Volkswagen mechanics--we've got people who
     work for NASA, we've got--

SR:  [Laughing]  You can't lose!

CO:  [Laughing]  I know!  We've got--we've got everybody!  We've got
     researchers, we've got--well, we've got a lot of computer geeks,
     let me tell you.  And ah, then there's me!

SR:  Christa, I'm going to mention your home page address at the end of
     our interview--

CO:  Thank you!

SR:  Just so that you don't have to do it and do all the slashes and
     dots... [laughs]

CO:  I know, I know, actually I hate it.  *I'm* not the computer nerd,
     but I tell you without it I wouldn't have met all these fabulous
     people.  And I have places to stay... in Puerto Rico now!

SR:  That's great!  What route are you taking?

CO:  We're going--Today we're taking the Sea-to-Sky Highway which is the
     really pretty road up past Whistler, and we're going--tonight we
     hope to get to Quesnel.  Then from there we're sort of going inland
     a bit, coastal-slash, then we move inland and we get up to sort of
     Liard Hot Springs, that area.  Then over to Dawson City, and then
     of course we take the Dempster Highway, which is the only way in
     and out.  And that's some huge number of miles of unpaved road--
     kilometres of unpaved road--but it just looks *spectacular.*  I'm a
     bit nervous about the bugs.  And then coming down, we're doing sort
     of the same thing but we're going coastal a little bit more and we
     taking--some people are taking the Alaska Marine Highway, a couple
     of them are breaking off there--and we're taking the B.C. Ferry
     from Prince Rupert to Port Hardy, and then we'll end up on the
     Island for a couple of days--

SR:  Gorgeous.

CO:  So it's really going to be--yeah!--it's going to be a real slice of
     Canada.

SR:  How long?

CO:  Um, I think it should take us about nine days up, barring any uh,
     major break-downs, and you know that's a stop and Liard Hot Springs
     and have a little soak.  That could even factor in a minor break-
     down.  A couple of days in Inuvik, enough to take a train--a train?
     no, a *plane* up to Tuktoyaktuk, and then we really start back down
     again.  You know, my friends--non-VW friends--just sort of go,
     &quot;What? Nine days for two days there?&quot;  It's sort of the VW
     experience!

SR:  And once you get up there--I mean time will--time's different up
     there, you know?

CO:  Well, and it's *light!*  All the time!

SR:  Yeah!

CO:  We're going to play golf at midnight like Peter [Gzowski, long-time
     host of Morningside] does!

SR:  [Laughs!]  He does it in the winter!

CO:  [Laughing]  Oh, no!

SR:  It's spring, but it's still winter!

CO:  It's winter, all right!

SR:  What's the oldest van that's travelling with you--the oldest bus?

CO:  Um, a sixty one?  Sixty three, something like that.  And it's um,
     apparently it's in pretty good running order--one of the mechanics
     drives that one.  And the brand newest in a 1995 Eur-o-van, which
     is kind of a mini... van, I think.  It's not done in the same
     traditional style but it counts because VW does actually make it.
     And that was given to us--given to Ron, one of our web page guys,
     by VW.

SR:  Bet it's not mango.

CO:  It is *so* not mango!  They're--

SR:  [Laughs, hard]

CO:  They're all *white* now--white!  I mean what are you going to do up
     in Inuvik with a white camper?

SR:  The Dempster Highway will be very kind to it--to, to white--

CO:  Exactly...

SR:  Have a *great* trip!

CO:  Thank you so much, Shelagh!

SR:  All the best, you're starting off today!  It's kind of you to talk
     to us.

CO:  Thanks so much.

SR:  Bye Christa, travel well.

CO:  Bye bye.  Thank you.

SR:  Christa Ovenell in Vancouver.  And if you're on the 'net you can
     actually follow the convoy's progress.  The web site address is
     (ready?): h-t-t-p, colon, back-slash back-slash w-w-w dot chaco
     (that's c-h-a-c-o) dot com slash inuvik, slash!  That's it!  And
     we'll have it for you if you call in, 'cause I'm not going to say
     it again, no way!
