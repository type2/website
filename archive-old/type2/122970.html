Subject: [T2] FLAT SPOT- SOUTH AFRICAN CONTACTS

I'm new to T2, totally green and not a mechanic but ok with my hands. Have a
burnt orange 1970 T2 1600 twin port and reconditioned the engine, carb &amp;
distributor but it still has a flat spot at low revs. When you  pull off or
change up a gear, the engine dies and power only picks up once the revs rise
again. Sometimes backing off the accelerator helps, other times putting foot
helps, sometimes even pumping the accelerator seems to help a bit.  All the
'experts' in Cape Town accuse each other, its the engine or the carb but no
one seems to know.   Both the Carb and Distributor have been swapped to test
but the problem persists, sometimes slightly better but never consistent.
Any ideas???.

Also do you have a list for South Africa or any good contacts in Cape Town
for T2 parts, clubs, nice T2 people to know.  There is a split-screen club
but they don't respond to my emails, probably not interested.
