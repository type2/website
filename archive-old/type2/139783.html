&gt; &gt; When I was putting my 78' Westy together I got very little airflow

&gt; &gt; that a mouse had gotten into the heater tube that runs under the cabin
&gt; &gt; floor and had built a nest.

be carefull of this, I had an engine sit for over a year and when I used
it a mouse had also built a nest, but the nest also caught fire when the
engine got hot, not right away but about 10 minutes AFTER I shut things
down, if not for an observant bystander and the always neccesary fire ext
I would have lost a bus for a mouse house....
