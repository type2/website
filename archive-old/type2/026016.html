&gt; also, what tools/cleaners has anyone used to clean the engine?  the shop
&gt; fellas were against steaming the engine.

I like Castrol Super Clean. It's expensive, but if you get the gallon refill
and a cheap empty spray bottle it's more reasonable. (Best place to get
empty spray bottles is at a beauty supply store; they have these little ones
hairstylists use for hair chemicals, and those are easier to use around an
engine. They also have big ones.)
