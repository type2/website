Subject: I'm at a loss......

The Vw G_ds are frowning on me lately. I have a '71 Westy that had a
1600 DP w/ extractor,Kadrons, and a vacuum advance dizzy. Got horrible
gas mileage and my vacuum gauge started jumping all over the place at
idle. While I was getting ready to go to EB found very low compression
in #3. I thought that I would switch engines to a 1776 that had about
100 miles on it built from a new case, Berg CW crank, Engle 110 cam,
Berg exhaust, totally balanced by Berg from the crank pulley to the
clutch, Dellorato 40's, and all tin and thermostat installed.

Finally, got it in the night before Circle Yer Wagons and it started
right up. Great, thought I. Tried to set the timing and ,at 3000 rpm,
the timing mark jumps all over the place from TDC to 45 degrees advance.
Steady at idle. My vacuum gauge still jumps all over the place at idle.

Here's what I have tried...
1.Two different timing lights - same results.
2. Two different distributors- same results.
3. Adjusted valves 3 times.
4. Replace cap, rotor, and spark plug wires.
5. Sprayed for vacuum leaks and couldn't find any.
6. Re-installed Kadron carbs- same results.
7. Compression check shows all cylinders above 120 with less that 5%
difference.

Can someone shed some light on what I might try or the cause of the
problems? PLEASE!!!! I'm tired of having to eat all the cherries
myself-I wanna go camping... TBear  PS Couldn't find any help in the
archives.  

Don't take life to seriously--you'll never live through it.
