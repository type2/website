&lt;&lt; My question is, which years used the same type of 
     transmission as the one I already have? &gt;&gt;

Those would be the 1st generation 091s that came in '76-79's.
If you get in a real jam you should be able to rig a '68-'75 002
Bus transaxle to work.  But be advised that its not a straight
forward swap.
