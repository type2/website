&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;&lt; The check list looks good I would advise you to loose the fix-a-flat. That
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; stuff is really bad. It also contains flammable material which I have
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Any feedback on &quot;Slime&quot; pre-puncture sealant...A buddy of mine uses it
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; wouldn't touch the stuff with a ten foot pole, would drive on the flat
&gt; &gt; &gt; first, it does less damage to the tire!!!!  (and I know from first hand
&gt; &gt; &gt; experience)
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Well, tell us your experience, don't just slam the product!  How can Slime
&gt; &gt; damage a tire?  The only negatives that I've found about Slime in over a
&gt; &gt; decade of use are:
&gt;
&gt; Well as many people on the list know, I use a wheelchair, my chair has
&gt; high presure tires on all wheels.  I have to go no matter what, get an
&gt; occasional flat.  sitting on the curb in my suit fixing a flat is a
&gt; bummer, so I have tried just about everything, and I have seen the inside
&gt; of the tires and tubes....it sticks to everything I have had to throw away
&gt; good tires and once a rim because that stuff would not come off so that a
&gt; new tire could seal on the rim..

Tubeless tires on a wheelchair?  Progress marches on!

I can see your point, but I've found that the Slime brand stuff is water
soluble.  I've never had any problem cleaning it up, but I've always had
running water to work with.

I worked for 15 years with a fellow who used a wheelchair and
as the handy guy in the department fixed quite a few of his flats.  I
would have suggested Slime to him, but he went to non-pneumatic tubes and
his flat problem went away.  Seemed as though the non-pneumatics were a
bit &quot;slower&quot; and heavier than the pneumatics, but he loved them.

Vehicular use is considerably different than low-speed use, which is
probably why your results are poor.  I agree that Slime makes patching
impossible, which is why I don't use it on tubeless tires.  With tubes,
the stuff has worked very well for me.  I dislike patching motorcycle
tires on the way to work as much as you dislike patching wheelchair tires,
and Slime has sealed several punctures so that I could fix them (by
replacing the tube) in the comfort of my garage rather than at the side of
the freeway.
