Subject: RE: [T2] Oil temp sender/sump plate

&quot;the pressure relief valve sender read ~5 degrees lower than the
dipstick.
the sump plate sender read ~15 degrees lower than the dipstick.&quot;

I'm not sure how it is possible that the sump plate sender reads ~15 degrees 
lower than a dipstick one since my sump plate sender sits about 1/2 inch 
away from the end of my dipstick on my engine.  I'm not familiar with the 
dipstick sender, but I'm guessing that the thermocouple is at the end of the 
dipstick in the oil flow.
