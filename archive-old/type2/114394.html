Subject: RE: [T2] motorcycle jack

Aren't they great?!

I bolted 2X4s to the lifting arms on mine and was able to install a
Corvair engine and tranny combo into my bus by myself.

This is a tool that everyone with a smooth surface to roll on and an
engine to drop should have.

Its amazing that you can purchase one for $71. I think people should
jump on that price.

 A few weeks ago, there was a thread describing the merits of a
certain type of motorcycle jack for pulling the engine from a Type II.
