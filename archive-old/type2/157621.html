My experience with a shelf in the same location is that it can be a
kneebanger if extended out as far as your mockup.  You want to keep it
forward (FIF) of the lower lip of the dash.

There are quite a few places where you can hang the box.  I hung my shelf
from the lip of the dash and from existing screws on the air duct.
