&gt; Should I be changing the oil strainer and gaskets with every oil/filter
&gt; change?  I've done so every time so far, but found nothing there of
&gt; concern.  Yes, I am aware of the wimpy torque spec and the need to
&gt; adhere to it.

I just clean it out and use new gaskets. I don't find much either. I've read
the strainer isn't as fine mesh as the original anyway. I think you'll find
people on either side of the fence on this issue. Personally, I like to know
what's inside.
