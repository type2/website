Subject: RARE Westy Stuff!  (PLAID FABRIC!)

Just in on my container from Germany and worth noting because of their
rarity ...

PLAID FABRIC -
I got an original roll of the fabled Green Plaid fabric, used in '76-79
green Westfalia campers. This is the first time you've been able to buy this
new.  Now you can recover your front seats and sofabed with the correct
material.  $59 per running meter (about 3 ft x 6 ft).  Click here:

GENUINE WESTFALIA POPTOP CANVAS -
This is the real thing from Germany, not the aftermarket one that has until
now was the only canvas you could buy. Correct fit, texture, etc.   The
'68-73 canvas has three windows (as stock), the '74-79 one front window.
$299.  I only have three of each, and only in tan. I may have more in the
summer but it's not a sure thing.

CURTAIN TIE-BACKS
These are the plastic ties that hold your curtains back; the ones that snap
to the body and then around the curtain. These are dark brown rather than
black but otherwise correct for a later style bus.  Genuine Westfalia.  I
only have about 15 sets.  $12.95/pair.

TABLE MOUNT
This is the mount that is screwed to the bottom of a '76-79 rear table. I
only have two. $39 each. Not on the website. First two people to email me
get them.

Thanks,
