Subject: [T2] broken shock bolt

Does anyone have a recommendation for dealing with a broken upper shock
mounting bolt? I heard a knocking from the back end the other day and when I
investigated it appeared that the shock bolt had come loose. But no amount
of turning it will tighten it up, so the thing has either stripped out or
broken. Will a Helicoil hold it? Drill and tap?
