&gt;Details, details, details... or as Boeing's president once said [my
&gt;paraphrase], &quot;The Boeing 747 is actually just 6 million parts, flying
&gt;in close formation.&quot;

Didn't Mies Van der Rohe say it best?  &quot;God is in the Details..&quot;  That's why I became enamored with VWs in the first place...
A 25 year-old car that I have to crack the window on just to
 shut the door, the darned thing's so airtight!  VW invented
not only brand loyalty, but also Quality Control.  Long live 
the aircooled VW!
