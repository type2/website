Subject: Re: Door seal replacement

I recently replaced my door seals.  I used a sharpened regular screw driver and
peeled the old stuff off very slowly and carefully.  Didn't gouge the paint at
all and it worked pretty well.  The old weather strip was very old and
practically fell off in most places though.

Good Luck,
