Subject: [T2] Workin on the third

I pulled the plugs and did a compression check.  120 -130 psi 
semiwarm.  Plugs looked brown, no soot. Don't think they've been 
changed in a while.  Reset the timing and she run smoother.  I 
noticed that this one has points.  I thought all Vanagons were 
electronic but looking at Bentley I see that early air cooled Fed s 
were not.

  I suspect that I have a weak lifter but will pull them when I pull 
the engine train and inspect.  Tempted to put back in solids.  A 
little adjusting is easier than replacing bad lifters, plus I think 
you get better power and longevity with solids.

  I think I know why it was leaking slightly thru the rear seal.  When 
I popped the valve covers a quart of oil leaked out.  The PO must 
have overfilled the oil.  I'll replace the rear seal anyway.

Need to find a good source for a rebuilt tranny.  Please let me know 
if you have a lead.  Going to pull the drive train tomorrow and would 
like to get this thing buttoned back up by next week and on the road.

Thanks for your help
