Subject: Weber manifold problem?

List,
Just before bed the other night, i was
contemplating my Weber DFEV and its manifold -
the kind for the type4 conversion. It sits
rebuilt on my dresser awaiting installation. 

I noticed something - perhaps a new shortcoming
of this setup.  The carb functions such that the
primary throttle barrel does most of the work;
the secondary only begins to open at maybe a
little  under half throttle - maybe more, maybe
less. Anyway, the manifold is designed in such
away that the barrels  of the carb line up over
the manifold ports that connect to the runners
that go to either cylinders 1&amp;3 or 2&amp;4.

If the carb sits so that you're looking at the
main idle screw when you look into the engine
compartment (normal position), then the primary
throttle body sits in line with (over) the ports
for 2&amp;4. 

Now, i know all four cylinders should pull the
mixture at the same rate, but if the mixture
exits the carb directly over the ports for #2&amp;4
(a couple inches away from the ports for #1&amp;3), i
figure one of  two things may be happening: 
1. #s 2&amp;4 are running rich 
2. #s 1&amp;3 are running lean until the secondary
opens. 
Now, my knowledge of fluid dynamics and flow is
very limited and it 
may be that when the mixture hits the manifold,
it gets distributed 
evenly, but it just doesn't seem that way. If
you hold a lit 
cigarette behind two fans of equal strength but
a little closer to 
one of the fans than the other, the smoke will
get sucked through the 
fan it is closer to, correct? 
 
A solution to this would be a manifold that
looks more like a type1 
manifold, where the mixture is joined into one
pipe after the carb 
manifold and then split into the two ports at
the manifold on the 
head. 

I saw one of these - for a type4 engine - on
ebay a while back but 
haven't been able to find it since. I think
this kit had an IDF 
sitting on it. 
Installed on a bus, this intake system would
appear to have a solid 
pipe (runner)on the right (from the carb
manifold to the head) and a 
split runner on the left with a boot joining
the cut. Shiny, chrome 
thing. Mighty purdy. 

Has anyone else seen these? Its probably a
porsche marketed part. 
 
Thanks for reading and, with all due respect,
please don't tell me to 
go buy a set of duals or convert to FI. I just
don't have that kind 
of money or time. 

sincerely, 
clark gordon
