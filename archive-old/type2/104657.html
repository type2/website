I don't remember mine doing this.  If I recall, the spec for bearing clearance is only a couple of thousandths of an inch.  With the surfaces oiled (I assume that area is not &quot;dry&quot;, even though you've started to disassemble it) there should be no &quot;pivoting&quot; of the rod at all.  If there was no oil on the bearings at all, it might pivot a tiny bit, but even then I think 2-3mm is way too much.  Just for the sake of knowledge, go buy a plastigage kit and measure the clearance:

My opinion is that the bottom end of your engine will need to be rebuilt.  :-(
