&gt; Hello All,
I noticed an increase in my exhaust noise the other day and went through
everything ensuring all was tight.  Turns out one of my exhaust studs on
ole #3 is stripped and will not allow me to tighten my j-tube down.

I did a quick search at lunch of the archives but didn't see whether a
helicoil or other type fix could be accomplished with the head installed.
Any suggestions?

Thanks in advance!

If you can scrunch your body down into where the loose stud is, and work your hand in where it lives, you can put in a helicoil with the engine in and head on.
