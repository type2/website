Subject: looking to install a New DP engine in a 68 bus. questions...

Hello List,

My 68 bus has a very stock single port engine which is
rather weak and tired. his engine has an unknown
history and mileage. I plan to go on a cross country
trip this fall and am looking to install a new engine
in this bus as well as go over the axles and breakes.
I found that I could buy a New dp engine for less than
the price of a rebuilt single port. I found a NEW dual
port 1600cc engine for $950.00. I would like to keep
the stock single 30 pict carb settup as well as the
stock distributor and fan housing if possible. Other
than replacing the intake end castings with dual port
castings and replacing the top engine tin with dp
engine tin, what else would need to be done? I am on a
tight budget, but I want to do this right. Should I
look for used 71 intake end castings or invest in new
ones? do I have to change the fan housing or can I use
the 68 fan housing with the 68 generator and fuel
pump? Thanks in advance!

Regards,
David Kelly
