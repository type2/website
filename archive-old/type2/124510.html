Subject: Speedometer

That's correct.

&gt;&gt; Also - can someone explain to me what the little red dots are on my
speedometer.  There is a series (1 dot, 2 dots, three dots) at different
points on the gage.  Someone told me these are max speeds (redline) in each
gear and the dots correspond to the gear.  Is this true?
