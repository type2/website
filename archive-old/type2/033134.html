Volks,

Well, the westy floor is indeed 3/4&quot; thick, but it is not all one layer.
Don't have a Riviera, so I can't testify on that, but on the Westfalia the
floor is three layers...  first there is a layer of fibreboard (1/2&quot;
home-a-sote or equivalent will work) that fills in the corrugated section
of the floor, this is covered by a layer of masonite 1/8&quot; thick, then the
finishg floor (vinyl on early buses, carpet on later ones) that is ~1/8&quot;.
The total thickness is 3/4&quot; in the center but the fiberboard does not
extend all the way to the edges because the floor is not depresed at the
edges.  If you use a solid piece of 3/4&quot; plywood, either it will not get
all the way to the door or it will not sit on the floor in the center.

I have the pieces of a '75 Westy floor sitting in my basement and have
intended to measure them up and post a plan for quite a while.  Maybe this
afternoon... :-)
