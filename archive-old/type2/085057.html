Hello All  This might be a real good idea.  We could also just use the AIRS 
list. I would be more than glad to tell you guys and gals the best camping 
places here in God's country. For those that don't know western Virginia is 
one of the nices areas in the USA. Come to Naturalbus june 7,8,9,2002 and see 
for yourself. http://homepage.mac_dot_com/naturalbus/      Later Mark Dearing
