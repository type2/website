Subject: spilling gas

Esteemed List,

I've gotten into the habit of filling my gas tank to only about 3/4 capacity
because otherwise fuel spills out as I drive.  I have a permanent stain on the
rear quarter panel below the fill tube access door (any suggestions on how to
remove the stain?).  So my main question to the list is why is the fuel
spilling out (I don't drive like a maniac or take sharp corners at speed) and
what do I do to prevent it?

Thanks,

Juan
