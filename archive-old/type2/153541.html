Subject: Re: Fw: [T2] Testing a Fuel Injection harness??

I don't *think* I'm reading it wrong.  There's a note on the wiring diagram 
for the AFC 1980, 1981 which reads &quot;... a series resistance is located 
between fuel injection control unit and injectors.&quot;  That leads me to 
believe that I should see some sort of resistor symbol on the wire run from 
the injector to the FI Control Unit (ECU), but there's nothing there.  The 
wire run from the injector to the ECU is diagramed as a straight run, and my 
continuity test bears that out.  On the other side of the injectors the 
wires run to terminals with numbers that match those on the dual relay.

Now, maybe the series resistance (for diagram purposes) is embodied right in 
the injector symbol (sort of a bow tie attached to one end of a  rectangular 
box, the box having a diagonal line through it) but there's no indication of 
terminals or connectors, and the injector symbol isn't included in the 
&quot;symbols used in wiring diagrams&quot; section of the manual.  Of the symbols 
included there, the symbol closest to the injector symbol is one defined as 
&quot;electromagnetic relay&quot;, which kind of makes sense; the injector triggers 
fuel flow, not electron flow.

&gt;&gt; After posting I went back to my testing and discovered that I had 
&gt;&gt; continuity
&gt;&gt; at the resistor pack connection.  So, you're correct.  However, the 
&gt;&gt; Bentley
&gt;&gt; says the terminals for the FI connectors are 88e, 88b and 88f, which are
&gt;&gt; identified on the dual relay as such.  Is this a Bentley error, or am I
&gt;&gt; reading things wrong?
&gt;
&gt; I don't have the bentley in front of me, but I'm guessing that you're 
&gt; reading it wrong.  The injectors have to have the resistors on one side of 
&gt; the circuit otherwise they will put too large of a load on the computer. 
&gt; I believe that they are lo-z (low impedance) injectors.  I have to do the 
&gt; same w/ my MegaSquirt - that or turn on pulse width modulation.  It was 
&gt; easier to chop the stock harness and leave the resistors in place.
