The pacesetter looks like the 2nd picture enclosed, the one on the bus and 
is available in single port and dual port flange. It says 72-74 and 79-83 
are the same, also available75-78

&gt; &gt; I saw a nice one piece unit in jcwhitney for like 80 bucks made by
&gt; &gt; pacesetter that replaces all three pieces if you can run without the
&gt; &gt; cat.converter legally. Have not tried it but probably will order one for 
&gt;my
&gt; &gt; 82 westy soon.
&gt;   Hi- see the enclosed pic- I wanted a replacement for the muffler seen
&gt;(75 bus, same as on my 78- no crossover pipe, bolts right to the
&gt;heaterboxes, the right pipe exits from the right side of the muffler
&gt;tube), and Ron of busdepot sent the one that looks more like a beetle
&gt;muffler- what does the pacesetter look like compared to these??  Thanks
&gt;-our westy can be seen at http://www.geocities_dot_com/mike_benthin
