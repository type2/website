Subject: Re: [T2] Broke down in PA, need info on tranny.

THANKS for all the info guys!

Pat is on the road again!!

This morning, I called Pat and told her the best bet may 
be swapping bell housings. When I got there, she had 
already swapped out bellhousings.
The diagnosis was easy on her tranny! FUBAR!  Gear CHUNKS 
along with the drive shaft fell out of the bell housing. I 
am not familiar at all with tranny insides, so I cannot 
really say what the domino effect was to get to that 
point.

So, we tried to put the engine back in. No go! Wiggled, 
waggled, nothing. Dropped the engine and brought back from 
out of the Bus. I couldn't find my clutch alignment tool, 
so I thought the broken drive shaft would make a fine one. 
 I went to insert it into the clutch disc and it was on an 
angle!!  So, we removed the pressure plate and realigned 
the clutch. Back under the Bus. Within 5 minutes... BAM! 
Swweeet!!

But of course we had one more lil deal to work with, 
adjusting the plate at the base of the shifter.(DANG IT! I 
could not find anything on adjusting that plate in the 
idiot's guide or a Bentley. I know it's in there, what is 
it under?? Anyhow, she only had 2nd, 4th, and R. So we 
messed around with the plate and got it into place!!

On the road in time to enjoy the 4th of July!!
