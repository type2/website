Josh,
  It seems that those who take the time to help others...
Rarely seek the same.
  We dont feel our problems are big enough to take up
the time of others....
  I'm sure you had many there who loved you, but sometimes
it's hardest to turn to those who are closest to us.
  I am sorry you didnt choose one of us. You were a light
for many....now you are out.
  So now we are all in a place that is just a bit darker....we have
all lost. I know your good karma will put you in a better place.

         Peace,
                 Daniel Axel Simmons

&quot;Living your life is a task so difficult, 
it has never been attempted before.&quot;
