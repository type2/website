Volks,=20

Came across a stock Volkswagen mid 70's am/fm radio.  It was in an old =
van that has been stood up at least 15 years. =20

It was not rusty, and everything moves and functions....I think their is =
a reasonable chance it may still work  .  I want to put it in my 70 =
single cab, with one speaker directly above it...like the good old days!

I do not understand the wiring that i figure is for the speaker.  There =
is a pigpail with 3 wires that come out of the side of the radio.  red =
w/brown stripe, brown, and green...........Hopefully I can get it to =
work.  If not, it will look cool anyway!
