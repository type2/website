Tom Forhan sed:
&gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt; Because they are always moving up and down through thinner and thicker
&gt;&gt; &gt; air, airplane drivers routinely adjust the leaness/richness
&gt;&gt; &gt; of their aircraft engines with altitude, and its often done with
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Which makes me wonder...could a person retrofit an airplane carb. to a VW
&gt;&gt; engine and rig it so that either mechanically or electrically, you could
&gt;&gt; adjust the mixture?  That would be neat...albeit a pain in the rear at
&gt;&gt; times..to adjust for altitude changes...
&gt;&gt;
Somewhere in my VW lit collection I have seen pix of a VW part called an
altitude compensator which was designed specifically to adjust mixture with
altitude changes on Solex carbs fitted to VWs. I don't know how it worked,
but if anyone is interested they can mail me direct and I'll see if I've
got any more info.
