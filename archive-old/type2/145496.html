Heck, there was a trailer for &quot;Cars&quot; on the DVD of &quot;The Incredibles&quot; that
was released in March 2005, but no microbus to tease us.

If you want to see animated buses, check out the &quot;Dilbert&quot; DVD set.  Lots
of buses, both bays and splits, in just about every driving scene.
