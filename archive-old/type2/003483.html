The solenoid will have an extra push-on terminal for fuel injected motors,
but it should still work fine for carbureted motors.

I had the identical problem a couple of weeks ago when I replaced my
starter. My '73 Westy continued to crank without the key in the ignition.
Believe it or not, the problem turned out to be fragments of a brass starter
bushing that had fallen into the bellhousing of the tranny. These fragments
caused the starter pinion not to fully disengage which left the starter
circuit open. Eventually, the starter/solenoid just burned up. I removed the
toasted starter/solenoid and then cleaned out all the brass fragments in the
hole and dropped some grease down into the bellhousing to capture any other
possible fragments. I installed a new starter and knock on wood, it's
working fine now.

This may not be the cure for your Bus, but you've got an open starter
circuit for sure.

&lt;As a result, when I turn the key to start the bus, the starter enganges and
cranks the engine, when I release the key the starter continues to crank,
even if I turn the bus off??  I then have to remove the negative battery
cable to stop the starter from cranking.  Does the FI and non-FI have
different soleniods?? Please help..&gt;
