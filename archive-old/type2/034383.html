Chris..believe Bentley does have the entire dual adjustment described..at
least in my version.  Let me know if yours doesn't and I'll try to fax you
the bit. The one you're describing, I think, is for the idle circuit cutoff.
Haven't messed with duals since futzing, in the Milwaukee snow, with the
since-squished hightop camper we bought by phone a couple years ago..so
don't hold me to that.
