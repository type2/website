Subject: Re: [T2] poor student's  76 bus needs front axle beam

&gt; P.s. what years fit a 76 bus beam?

All beams from 1970 until 1979. Be aware that some busses might have
been produced with out a Brake servo. In that case you must remove the
mountings for the servo from the old axle and weld it to the new one.
But in the case of US-busses I think most of them (the T2b anyway) have
a brake servo.

To make sure you got the right axle you can measure the distance between
the bolts that hold the axle to the chassis. On the old ones it is 9cm
and the new ones 12cm if I'm correct.

With a little bit of imagination you can see one side of the front axle
below. The distance I mean is between the the two &quot;x&quot;-es on the left.
The two &quot;x&quot;-es on the right should have the same distance


&lt;-- front of the bus
