Subject: [T2] engine revs when brakes are applied &amp; main seal ques.

a friend &amp; i went to look at a bus yesterday. its a '73 standard. a couple of
questions regarding our initial inspection.

1) the engine revs slightly when the brakes are applied.  i was thinking that
this could possibly be a problem with the brake booster? maybe a bad check
valve or similar problem in the booster?

2) engine main seal: the current owner says that the last time the engine
was dropped, it was dropped without removing the transmission/engine as one
unit.  he thinks the main seal between the engine/tranny may be bad, as it
has leaked since. however, upon visual inpection yesterday as well as a
3 or 4 mile road test yesterday it did not appear to be leaking. being
as this might be a little advanced for my mechanical ability, i was wondering
what would be a 'resonable price' to expect a mechanic to replace this seal?

overall the bus is pretty solid &amp; my friend &amp; i think we can get it for a
steal of a price.  we would just like to know a little info about these 2
particular items before we dive in. if we dont buy it, i will forward the
info to the list so. apparently the current owner has had it for sale for
quite sometime &amp; is having trouble getting rid of it.

TIA
