Subject: Re: [T2] Bus prices

Even with having to jump thru the rear end looking for required smog &amp; FI
stuff, 76-79 Type 2s are definitely holding their own in prices, at least in
Southern California.  I don't expect a decline, especially for Westy models
to fall anytime soon - they're in a fairly large demand locally.  Here in
Ventura, CA, they're getting decent to top dollar.

&gt; I would expect western U.S. bus prices to be depressed for 1976-1979
&gt; years, especially now for 1976 and 1977, due to changes for smog in
&gt; California. But so far, they don't seem to be. Anyone know why?
