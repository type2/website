&gt;&gt; hey now,
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; okay, i've been told several different things by different folks.
&gt;&gt; i'm looking for a winter oil. BUT, here are my winter conditions:
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; a) i'm in central nc.
&gt;&gt; b) i'd say average winter temp is 35-40 or so.
&gt;&gt; c) it ofter gets below freezing...
&gt;&gt; d) once in a while 15-25
&gt;&gt; e) RARELY it gets below 15.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; i've been told 20w50 is too heavy for this climate. i'm told folks round
&gt;&gt; here run this weight all the time. i'm told 10w30 is for colder climates.
&gt;&gt; i'm told 10w30 is good for this climate. i'm told 15w40 is a good
alternative.
&gt;&gt; ack! ack! ack! ack! ack!
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; opinions?
&gt;&gt; They say that opinions are like a**holes, everyone has one, so here's 
&gt;mine.  I suggest using a single weight oil in AC VW engines. 30W in the 
&gt;winter, and 40W in the summer. Works for me.

I guess I'll enter the melee. You may want to check out the oil faq
(http://ccwf.cc.utexas_dot_edu/~efrank/oilfaq.html). The oil FAQ states
&quot;...There are six of the most important properties of a motor oil readily
available to the public: viscosity, viscosity index (VI), flash point, pour
point, % sulfated ash, and % zinc.&quot; Since we are concerned mostly about what
temperature the oil will turn into goo, pour point becomes one of the most
important factors for a winter oil.

The faq defines &quot;pour point&quot; as &quot;... 5 degrees F above the point at which a
chilled oil shows no movement at the surface for 5 seconds when inclined.
This measurement is especially important for oils used in the winter. A
borderline pumping temperature is given by some manufacturers. This is the
temperature at which the oil will pump and maintain adequate oil pressure.
This was not given by a lot of the manufacturers, but seems to be about 20
degrees F above the pour point. The lower the pour point the better.&quot;

You can probably use 20W50 in your area with no worries about the oil being
to thick to pump, as long as it does not get below 10 F. Note that there is
considerable variation amongst brands of the same viscosity.

If anybody wants me to receive the oil faq, e-mail me direct (it's too long
of a post for the list).
