Subject: Re: thanks..tire carrier

&gt; thanks to all who posted info on a tire carrier.  Turns out that there
isn't
&gt; someone who makes a carrier that fits into the original 3 emblem holes
ONLY.

Hey, wait just a doggone minute.  I have one that fit in the original 3
holes!
No drilling required. Attaches w/ neat little rivet things.
I got it from Z-products somewhere in Washington state.
Found an add for them in Hot VW's
