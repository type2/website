i think mr. vanbondo offers some wisdom that we should all take heed of
BEFORE we jump in head first.

IMHO it is better (and cheaper!) if you are planning on restoring a split
is to find as pristine an example as you possible can. You (and your pocket
book) and your bloo pressure, Significan Other etc. will thank you in the
long run.

FWIW it is worth the wait for the &quot;right&quot; bus don't jump on the first bus
you see. There are still decent busses out there decide what you want what
you can afford and then start looking. IMHO it is worth the wait.
