Subject: Walk through panels

Josh spoke with bull dung in his brain when he wrote:
&quot;A panel COULD NOT ever be a walk-thru.&quot;

My '63 EZ Camper is indeed a walk through. If you ever see a panel with a
few air vent slats near the roof line directly above the engine compartment
air intake slats then it is a bench seat panel. Walk-through panels dont
have these vents near the roof line.
