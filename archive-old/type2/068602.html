Subject: 81 thermostat

I got around today to replacing the defective thermostat that I left off
during my rebuild last spring. Also needed a new cable and wheel/pulley.

I thought I would test the new one before installing it just to be sure. I
ran it under hot tap water expecting it to expand slowly in what I guessed
would be about 135* temps but instead it did nothing which led me to think it
might be defective. To be sure I then put it in boiling water where it almost
instantly extended it's full length. I pulled it out to measure it and it
shrank before I could put the tape on it! I put it back in the water to
measure it and figured that there is about 1&quot; of extention in it and that it
seems to be fully open at about 180*.

Jumping ahead a bit, that 180* doesn't have anything to do with your oil
temperature. At the same time that the thermostat was opening the air flaps,
the oil temp was barely begining to move off the 120* peg. I assume that the
thermostat is reacting to hot air off the cylinders. This was observed at
idle, it may be different just starting and moving off.

Did I mention that the failed thermostat was in a fully extended condition?
I've seen some debate in the past about the risk of a failed thermostat and
flap system ruining an engine via overheating. Since the flaps and the
thermostat fail &quot;open&quot;, I would say that risk is largely imagined

Installing the new unit was easy enough though per usual there were
unexpected complications. In this case I had bought new plastic grommets for
the flap bar to ride in. Getting those in involved loosening and prying tin
up etc. I also had a new red plastic piece left over that was related to all
this but I've since forgotten what it's purpose was. Next time I'm back at
the dealer, I'll get them to look it up again.

*Special Bonus* When I took my parts old and new out of the bag, I could
almost hear a distant voice, maybe Dave Schwarze, warning that the bolt that
held the plastic pulley actually went right through into the crankcase.
Before putting it back on I stuck a wire in there and damned if it disappear
for 6&quot; and come out with oil on it. Now I've been riding around for 6 months
with an open hole in my motor bitching about oil goo. Part of my plan today
had been to renew the valve cover gaskets and even use RTV on them to stem
the flow. Instead, since all the push rod tubes were bone dry but that lower
right tin was filled with oil, I just cleaned everything up and will give it
a few days to see if that hole wasn't the majority of the problem. I'm
optimistic about it since after my one 10 mile jaunt there was a single dime
sized drop as opposed to the usual &quot;puppy foot&quot; 3 big drop pattern.
