Subject: Re: [T2] Are these new or restored? - 2002 Type 2

&gt; You should also note (for you continued existence on the list) that the
charter specifically excludes discussion of post '83 aircooled VW buses - a
change made just after I purchased my Brazilian Camper in '98.
&gt;

I don't recall it saying that, or at least that wasn't the intent.  I love
hearing about your '98 Brazilian Bus.  I think the point was since the last
air-cooled van sold in the U.S. was in '83, we put the cut off at '83 so
those folks with water-cooled Vanagons would go to the Vanagon list.

Here's the actual quote from the charter:

This list is only about aircooled Volkswagen Transporters, Vanagons and
Caravelles, model years 1968 through 1983. If you have an earlier bus,
or a watercooled bus, you are on the wrong list.

Doesn't say that you can't post about your '98 Brazilian air-cooled Bus.
I'm all for it, wish I had one :-)
