'bout a year and half ago, I called Sway-A-Way to see if they would sell 
direct.

The sales rep said, no, but he could give me names of people.

He also said, perhaps jokingly, the while he could not sell me the 7/8&quot; sway 
bars, he could build me a set of 1&quot; sway bars for $400.

To the question, &quot;Are larger sway bars available??&quot;.  Well, possibly.
