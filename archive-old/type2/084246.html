Subject: Re: [T2] Save a Splittie Singlecab!! &amp; pictures

This email gave me an idea.  Since i've been into Volkswagens, and on 
the list, i've been sort of collecting pictures of busses.  And for me, 
the best pictures are of the most rotten abandoned busses.  Maybe it's 
because they have the most potential, or the best stories....   So, 
here's my idea.  We can't all save this bus.  I wish i could, and i tell 
you, if i was there, i'd do it.  But the next best thing, i think, is to 
have a picture of it, in that parking lot, with the broken windows and 
the bent door.

I don't know, maybe i'm weird.  What do you think?

Thanks,
