&gt; Hey guys,
&gt; 
&gt;      I'm a bit confused with my tail light wiring. I
&gt; purchased an original OEM wiring harness for a 1972
&gt; VW Bus. I'm trying to match it up with the diagram
&gt; that's in my Bently manual. Althogh most of the
&gt; colors do match up, some of them do not, and it gets
&gt; rather ambiguous with respect to how the side lamps
&gt; are wired. 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 1 - Brown IS used for ground and Black is
&gt; the positive 12 volt.

Use your continuity tester to see which terminal is
connected to the sidewall of the lamp socket. That is
ground. On the multi-light units, the grounds for all
the sockets should be connected, then to a spade
connector on the body nearby.

Determining which (+) terminal is brake and which is
taillight is more tricky but if wrong it's easy to
switch.

The side markers have tiny little wires. One from
harness to the end terminal of the lamp socket and one
from the sidewall of the socket to a ground on the
body. If I understood your questions, I think I've
answered them! -BaH
