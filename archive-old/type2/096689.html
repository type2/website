Subject: Towing and Road Service

A fellow list member suggested I check out AAA for possible road 
service.  This is the best news for me, the 55 year old guy 
travelling alone with my 8 and 10 year old autistic kids.  For $60 I 
get a membership and the usual trip-tych bennies AS WELL AS free 
towing to any spot within 100 miles.  I have no connection with AAA 
and don't even have a membership, but you can bet I will do so before 
heading out on my next long trip with the van.  They also include 
other roadside assistance if necessary, such as a battery charge and 
even a free tow if your spare is flat, gone, or you are too enfeebled 
to change it yourself.  I just checked out the web page for my state, 
entering something like &quot;AAA Wisconsin&quot; in Google.
