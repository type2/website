Subject: Re: OK, Someone took the flame bait...

Ok, I just had to respond.  First of all, I'm one of the hated &quot;young&quot; bus
owners that wants to experience the VW tradition.  I am a student, and
being one I don't have much money.  All the nice buses, at least the
Westys around here, cost at least $4000.  I bought mine for $1500 and it's
anything but nice.  The body is covered with bondo and there are a few
dents remaining.  The paint is white with black spots, like a cow.  Hardly
a collector's dream.

The reason I bought my bus is because I liked it.  No other reason than
that.  I want to go camping in it, but don't get much chance to with work
and school.  I guess that makes me evil, since I am not too interested in
restoring it to showroom stock condition.

Basically all this bitching about &quot;decimated&quot; VWs sounds alot like a &quot;I
got mine so screw everyone else&quot; to me, and I don't want this list
polluted with that.  If some deadhead buys a VW, you can be sure it's
because he loves it, and I have yet to meet someone that drives a bus that
doesn't feel the same way.  I think the fears of people buying a bus then
throwing it away are unfounded.

Just my opinion, I could be wrong...

Craig
