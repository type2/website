Hi, I am a fully paid member of the Type Two Owners Club.  I joined last
Autumn shortly after buying my '73 Westfalia which I am trying to do up
(with some professional help, I should add); like all other members I am
waiting for the spring so that I can drive, or simply spend time with,
my van.  My van should be sumatra green and pastel white, which will
look quite stunning when complete.  Until then I have to put up with the
efforts of some cretinous previous owner who gave it a coat of dark
green and brilliant white cellulose paint.

I have a technical question for you or anyone else to answer if
possible.  The dynamo has failed and I believe it would be sensible to
replace it with an alternator.  I justify my logic by telling you that
this is a family vehicle (with wife and 2 kids and therefore I want
plenty of juice in the battery) rather than a museum piece. 

Just Kampers were waiting 6 weeks for an alternator conversion kit so I
ordered from Volksbits instead.

Would the technical guru like to comment on my proposed conversion?
