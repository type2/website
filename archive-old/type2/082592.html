Subject: Re: [T2] racing buses on dirt

I got the book  &quot;VW Bus&quot; The First 50 Years for Xmas. On 
page 131 there's a picture of VW LT(Load Transport) 
built for the Yamaha Paris-Dakar team. It bears a 
passing resemblance to a vanagon(I mistook it for a crew 
cab vanagon at first glance).
The LT was front engine(water cooled) rear drive utility 
truck. I don't think they were ever sold in US.

Mike
&gt; Many years ago I heard a story that VW build a chase/support vehicle
&gt; for some baja/Paris Dakar Race from a bus.  The resulting off vehicle was
&gt; so good that it put many vehciles in the class it was chasing to shame.  I
&gt;  thinks the mods included 4 wheel drive, bottom armor, and a really
&gt; modified VW motor.
&gt; 
&gt; Any else hear of this or better yet have pics.
