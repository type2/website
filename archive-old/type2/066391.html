This, after all, is supposed to be the &quot;People's Car&quot;, affordable to own 
and maintain by those of less than auspicious means, and sometimes the 
homemade adornments, besides costing less than N.O.S., give one's 
Volkswagen its own individual personality.  

So I wrote:
Amen, brother Salmon!

I have often been impressed with the extent to which VW buses seem to
exceed any other vehicle (in the US and Canada anyway) in quaint, often
bizarre, sometimes very beautiful folk decoration.
 
I went to the Rainbow Gathering last year and was inspired to undertake a
new project of photojournalism to document the phenomenon of the &quot;Hippie
VW Bus.&quot; I saw some of the most incredibly customized, one up, lovingly decorated
vehicles there. The tradition, I'm sure, derives itself partly from &quot;FURTHUR (sic)&quot;
the famous acid  bus of Ken Kesey and the Merry Pranksters. But it also
derives itself from the VW traditions of the People's Car. 

The tradition of doing immaculate, sanitary, meticulously detail oriented 
vehicle restoration is also a grand one. Problem is, the logical conclusion of
that path is a vehicle that is far too valuable and primo to subject to the
slings and darts of outrageous fortune on the streets and actually DRIVE anywhere.
Much less go CAMPING in one. I assert that if you really want to continue
using your bus, you can't do an all out restoration. In my own case, I have 
striven for a middle ground, staying stock as a general rule of thumb (for 
example, when painting), except when it makes sense not to do so (i.e. extra 
temperature gauges, electronic ignition, supplemental oil cooler, modern materials
in valves for unleaded gas, etc.). 

I haven't gotten too far with my photo project yet, but I aspire to collect lots
of high quality photographs of lovingly decorated VW buses. I admire the sano
resto jobs, but I think the lovingly decorated hippie-style buses (and their
post-modern ilk, i.e. Scott's Doodle Bus) are much more interesting and 
arguably more valuable as expressions of a rich and diverse human culture.

Remember how John Muir said to buy  a bus? Something like, lie down in the back
and ask yourself- have happy people been living and driving and balling in here?
With a good hippie bus, there's no doubt: These buses are loved! I wish more
Deadheads knew how to changer their oil regularly though...

Party on,
Surfer Bob
