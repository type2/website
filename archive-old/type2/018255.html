hey listees.....
Suprisingly enough I found a guy who was really into v-dubs in my little
town of 7,000!  He sold all of his stuff except for a transaxle off of a
71 bug....and an engine out of a 71.
The engine has the clutch and flywheel and everything with it....heat
exchangers are good, muffler is well...needs to be replaced but
everything else is there....it has been sitting for 4 years with nothing
done to it...but he said last time it was running it ran like a sewing
machine...smooth.
He wants 300 bucks for it....  How much does a good motor usually go
for?  The compression is fine...and even has all of the hoses that
usually get torn...or fall off over time...

I was thinking about buying if for my 71 bus...just as a spare.
but if someone wants it....thats fine....just p-mail me....its in mid
wisconsin.

My main question was....how much do motors like this usually go for?

Thanks!
Isaiah
