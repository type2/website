Thanks to all who replied to me about the starter checkout.  Most of you =
pointed me to the http://www.hallvw.clara.co_dot_uk/starter.htm website, and =
Sean Bartnik pointed me to his site.  All good information that =
accomplishes what I was trying to do.  I finally found the thing I was =
really looking for, written by the lists own George Lyle (thanks =
George!).  I still can't remember where I found it, so I'm adding it =
here so it's in the archives.

STARTER TEST


Well, that depends on how you're hooking it up


The solenoid has two places to hook up to.=20


If you apply 12V to the spade connector and ground the starter housing, =
the gear should pop out and nothing else should happen.

If you apply 12V to the big stud that the battery cable was attached to =
and ground the starter housing, nothing should happen.

If you apply 12V to both the big stud and the spade connector and then =
ground the starter housing, the gear should pop out and the motor should =
turn.

Finally, if you apply 12V to the fat wire that goes from the solenoid =
into the starter proper and then ground the starter housing the motor =
should turn without the gear popping out.

If the third test doesn't cause the motor to turn, then the problem is =
either bad contacts in the solenoid or bad windings in the starter.  The =
fourth test checks the starter windings.

Thanks for the great response.  A great bunch of people helping each =
other out - that's what I really love about the list.
