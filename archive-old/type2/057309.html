Subject: bye Bob and seeking SWF and,,,,,,,

Wow, sorry to hear you are gone Bob! Thanks for putting up with
my questions in the past. Back then I was new to the net and had
no idea the volume you where dealing with. You remained patient
and didnt make me aware of the situation. As I became more &quot;Net
mature&quot; I realized how well known your site was and became more
selective in my ramblings to you.  I too would like to buy a copy of
the the sermons on C.D.!!! 
   Ok Jason,,,I dont have any SWFs but I can help turn up the heat in
your bus. I Installed a new 3&quot; heat transfer pipe with a in-line blower
fan up towards the front. The fan is a marine Bilge Blower fan and is
round so it more or less fits the round tube. I have a 74 which has a 
booster fan stock in the engine compartment. I removed this fan and
am useing the stock relay switch to power the in-line fan. This will
not take the place of the SWF but it will keep you warm at night,,,and
dry
your hair on the way to work in the a.m.!
