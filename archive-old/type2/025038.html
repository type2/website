Howdy,
	I drive a 1970 camper converted to bus in the Boston area.  I
removed the tranny, I don't know if it's original, and am curious if
anyone has any advice on maintenance.  It is hard to get from 2nd to
3rd.  The entire throw between all gears feels lose.  I don't know if
this is the nature of the beast or not.  Can I purchase a rebuild kit?
Should I take it to a tranny specialist?  
	The motor always seems to be working to hard in all gears.  Is
it possible that someone installed a Bug tranny?  I already identified
the motor as a Bug 1968 1500.  Is there somewhere I can research the
tranny case numbers?  Thank You in advance for the help.
				Dan
