Subject: 2.0 heads on *bay
Mime-Version: 1.0

Well you know where they are, I was toying with buying these as
the guy mistakenly has them labelled as Vanagon (implying square
port heads) but the one in the picture at least is not.  In my estimation
by his description they are AMC's universal 1.8/2.0 (with 1.7 or late 2.0
valve size) heads.  Always a possibility the one shown is round port
and the other (from the box with the P/N) is a square port, who knows.

At $150 with 21 hours or so to go right now, nominally $250-$350 each
new.  Like I've said, I don't know about the round port AMC heads but
depending on what they go for these could be a deal for someone.
Buy em new and have them worked over as cores for a performance
engine and the seats replaced anyway.

These would be $500 at least from onyone else volks.  I got no affiliation
with anyone just trying to pass on a deal.
