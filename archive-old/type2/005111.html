&gt;Cultivate a powerful belly laugh. Not a giggle or a twitter, but a
&gt;bone-shaking infectious belly laugh. When the dealer parts guy quotes a
&gt;price like $12 for an exhaust gasket, laugh. $400 for a catalytic
&gt;converter? Laugh.


Good advice.

Actually they start laughing when they see me coming cause they know I'm
about to have them look up 40 items, get the part numbers, and maybe buy
only one from them at best.  I think they cry when I leave 8-)
