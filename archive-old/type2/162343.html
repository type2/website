&gt; &gt; I've often wondered if those skylights (standee windows) could be put in a
&gt; &gt; bay....
&gt;
&gt; If you search the Samba Gallery you should be able to find a picture or two
&gt; of the skylights fitted into a bay roof ( I think it was there I saw them),
&gt; lot of work and as you've alluded to already you'll need to find the seals,
&gt; and IMHO they didn't look that great on the bay roof.
&gt;
&gt; For me, personally, the REAL &quot;must have&quot; items are the old ( pre '64 )
&gt; Deluxe corner windows and big window hatch, which is why I've got plans
&gt; (dreams?) to fit them onto the DC custom I'm trying to build

I had a 1960 23 window deluxe some years ago. always worried how I would
replace those windows if they ever got broken....fortunately never did.
wish I still had that old beast.  sold it about 1972 or so for $125
