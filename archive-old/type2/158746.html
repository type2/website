&gt;&gt; Pop the cover off the AFM and look closely at the

&gt;
&gt;This thread over at IAC has some great pics of the
&gt;inside of the AFM,including shots of the tracks.

&gt;
&gt;Just so you can see what you're gonna be looking at.

I've had grooves worn in my AFM resistor network
which resulted in poor contact at the wiper arm.
Loosening the mounting plate for the resistors,
nudging it over a bit and retightening it made the
wiper rub on a path next to the grooves.  Better
contact.

The resistor network is screen printed onto an alumina
substrate.  A pattern of gold, palladium silver,
carbon and glass pastes are screened on  and fired
in a furnace, like ceramics.

In the photos you may see the olive green rectangles.
These are the thick-film resistors with overglaze.
And the dark lines are where the resistor was trimmed
using a laser beam.

Whenever I put the lid back on the AFM, I put a small
bead of silicone sealant.  I figure it will keep
'false
air' and dirt from getting in there.   I digress...



As to the original post, it may be a bad temp sensor
on the cyl head.
