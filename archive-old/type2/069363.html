Subject: Battery Box

I am thinking of using a marine style battery box in my '77 westy and have
found that it does not fit.  I seem to recall someone once writing about
using one of these and I am wondering how they fit one?
What kind of battery box do you recommend (other than the large marine style)?
What should have been in there originally?  Some sort of tray?
Thanks once again,
brett
