I have a 72 bus and just today I was changing the oil and the oil filter. I
changed the filter then after I drained the oil. I was putting the oil drain
nut back on and the stud snapped. I guessed I turned it to hard! I'm really
pissed off because I've snapped studs before on other VW's (not as important
as this one, mostly exhaust studs) and I know how fragile they are on these
older cars that we all love so much! All I want to know is how I go about
fixing this. I know the remainder of the stud that's left in their has to
come out. Is this an easy job? What tools do I need? Also obviously my bus
has no oil in it because of this problem will it hurt if it stayed empty
until it is fixed (probably a couple of days)? Of course it won't be started.
The engine that I am currently having this problem with is a type 4 if thats 
any help!
.

Any help anyone can give me would be much help!

Thank You,
Jon
72 Delilah
