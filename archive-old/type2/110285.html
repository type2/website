&gt; I missed the original post on this too.  But for those of you who haven't
&gt; ventured into the world of latex gloves for car work, here's what I have to
&gt; say about it.

It was about how a guy uses corn starch sprinkled in the gloves to make it
easier to put them on.

&gt;&gt;However, a few cautions should be noted.  Various chemicals like carb
cleaner
and brake cleaner dissolve the gloves.&lt;&lt;

Use &quot;nitrille &quot; gloves if your going to use anything in the gasoline family.
I use the real thick Nitrille gloves you buy at the store for cleaning ovens,
in my parts cleaning bucket (mineral spirits).
