Experienced Bus Painters:

There was a question about this in the archives, but any answers must've
gone via p-mail.  I want a nice paint; but I don't want it to look like
a Lexus.  Is a Basecoat/Clearcoat system going to be too fancy looking
for an old VW?  What looks right for a 1970s VW?  For a while I was
thinking Acrylic Enamel, but now I'm thinking Acrylic Urethane, for
longevity.  Other factors to be considered are ease of use and expense,
of course.  This is my first paint job; and I just blew my entire
anticipated budget on a supplied air respirator (HobbyAir, one person,
halfmask, 40 feet, price now down to $344 through Eastwood).  My first
step, paint-wise, is going to be PPG DP40 epoxy primer, then probably
one of their primer/surfacer's (though which one depends at least in
part on the paint I decide to go with).  BTW, does anyone have any
experience with PPG's budget OMNI line?  There was one positive
testimonial in the archives.
