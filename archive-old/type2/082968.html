hey kary, welcome to bus &quot;ownershop&quot;;

I believe the souls in CA will be much better at helping you deal w/
the smog issues. But i can offer a trick i used to track down exactly
where I had exhaust leaks. If you are getting exhaust fumes in the cab
that dissapear when you disconnect the ductwork I would suspect a leak
as opposed to a bad body seal. I hooked up (well actually I jammed) my
shop vac set on blow up to the tailpipe. This let me go around the
engine at my leisure to track down any air leaks with my hand. Much
nicer than burning my hands on a running engine.
