&gt;Hi Volks,
&gt;Need to replace my rear shoes on my '70 westy.  I can't find a 46 mm
&gt;anywhere.  Is there a standard size that will work?  Thanks
&gt;

1 13/16 nominally but that big, anything close.

My standard plug, HARBOR FREIGHT, ask anyone who owns
the 3/4&quot; drive set.  Quality is ugly, but heavy enough that you
will never, NEVER, break it working on a VW.  Could you use
em every day on a rig? no.  Set is $30-$40 depending on what
sale they are running.  19-52mm or so.  This set has saved my
_at_#$ soo many times since I bought it 6-7 years ago it is unreal.
Sockets, ratchet, breaker bar, 2 extensions for less than a bar
and 2 Craftsman sockets had cost me.  Many on this list have
bought this set and been equally happy.  I'll note the American
and metrich sets probably only differ in what is stamped on em.
Also some local &quot;surplus&quot; place or the roving Chuck Homier's
sales etc will have these.  Or HF if you are in CA.  Most of HF's
hand tools are worth what you pay, but the 3/4&quot; set and the wobble
extension set are worth their weight in gold.  The wobble extensions
more than the 3/4&quot; set.  Craftsman will be a local source for a 46mm
at a good Searts, but $$$$$$$$$$$$.

They got a web site.

Oof, actually up to $46, but still worth it, wait for a sale though, it
will dip to $35.

ITEM 5494-3VGA
