Subject: Re: [T2] What part is it?

on 11/20/01 8:20 AM, you related:

&gt; Could someone please tell me what the second round plate underneath
&gt; the type IV engine is?

it is the SUMP PLATE. it is sealed by a large o-ring which is readily
available, even from the dealer. before taking it out, try GENTLY tightening
the 10mm screws that hold it into the sump - maybe it's just a bit loose in
there. you need to drain the oil before removing the plate. it is easy to
replace the o-ring.
