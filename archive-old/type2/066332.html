Subject: Re: What are &quot;Deadhead stickers&quot;?

 
&gt; The term &quot;Deadhead&quot; has been used by cross-country truckers since the
&gt; 1930s to denote driving their rigs from one point to another with no cargo
&gt; to pay the way.  A &quot;Deadhead&quot; sticker in modern etymological parlance
&gt; signifies that the driver of the VW bus has made at least one such
&gt; cargoless trip from one point to another with conscious intent.  The
&gt; subcultural clue here is &quot;conscious intent&quot;.  It speaks of a way of life
&gt; where the &quot;process&quot; of driving is more important than its &quot;content&quot;, and a
&gt; &quot;Deadhead sticker&quot; is a way of signalling this consciousness.  The VW bus
&gt; is chosen vehicle for those who are conscious, realized by only a few,
&gt; understood by even fewer, and the &quot;Deadhead&quot; Sticker their overt
&gt; acknowledgement of their status...

And not only that, if you have enough deadhead stickers you will be imbued
with the capacity to write the most over-the-top postings ever yet seen.
