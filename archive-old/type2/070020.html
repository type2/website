for the long piece on the drivers side you have a couple choices:

1)   use an immaculate original panel

2)  use an acceptable original panel

3)   make a new panel with the grain running the wrong way

4)   buy custom wood that is 6 foot wode with verticle grain to make a new
panel

5)   use a 4x8 sheet of regular wood, and splice it so the seam is hidden by
the table

guess what i'd do?
