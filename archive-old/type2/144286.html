Subject: Re: [T2] O2 Sensors

Don, 
I have an extractor with a single quiet pack, I welded the bung into the quiet pack just passed the 3 hole flange.  It works great.  It is a single wire with no heater.  It would only take about 30 seconds of idleing before my guage would read correctly.  I have this on my 2.0 with dellorto's so I was using the readings purely as visual monitor of the operating condition.  
You definatley want it installed before the muffler.  I thought about putting 4 sensors in and a 4 position switch to look at how each cylinder is operating..but never got there.
 
having an 02 sensor has saved my but more than once.

Those of you who've installed O2 sensors, where did you place them in
the exhaust?


Now, I was thinking about putting the bung at the tailpipe, but with a
3 wire O2 sensor so that it heats itself. Would this be accurate?
