Subject: Re: [T2] Fuel Pump, do I need one?

&quot;I would consider the addition of an oil pressure switch and a Ford inertia 
switch tot he fuel pump circuit&quot;

Thanks Chris,
     I already started replacing fuel lines.  I had not heard of an inertia 
switch before, what's it do and how does it work.  Also, what does an oil 
pressure switch have to do with stopping my fuel line?  Could you describe 
this set up to me a little further, or point me to a place where it's 
posted.  I agree, it sounds like some cheap insurance.

Jay
