&gt;Next question: Does the mileage change at all? (With regard to alcohol as
fuel -rsh)

Eddie,

Now you've gone and done it.  The last thing we need in any Green discussion
is a whiff of reality :-)  

Despite all the talk during the oil embargo of using alcohol as automobile
fuel, and despite the fact most racing engines are designed for it, and
despite the fact oil-less Brazil does pretty well with the stuff... alcohol
has not proven very practical for two simple reasons:  It costs more than
gasoline and it contains less energy.

I think I read that 16 to 20 mpg was considered quite good in an alky-fueled
bug.

Mass production would surely bring the cost down.  As Joel pointed out there
are any number of ways to generate alcohol, and ultra-large-scale stills
introduce economies of scale that might reduce the cost of distillation to a
point where alcohol might be even less expensive than gasoline.  But the fact
remains that a pound of alcohol has about half the energy potential of a
pound of gasoline.  Even if the cost were reduced to the point where alcohol
was less than half the cost of gas we would be faced with the practical
problems, such as fifty gallon fuel tanks and taking half an hour to refuel.
 I'm not saying we couldn't live with it, but...

Now guess what happens to those marvelous 'low emisson' figures when your
fuel efficiency is cut in half?  

As a vehicular fuel alcohol has a lot of problems that have not been
addressed by the environmentalists, partly because there are no easy
solutions.  Your comments about diesel power offer a path with a much greater
possibility of success -- and there are 40 mpg vegetable oils that are more
environmentally friendly than any form of alcohol.
