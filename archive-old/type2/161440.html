I would also guess that these are RON figures.  My 1967 Camaro has an 8.75:1
compression ratio and runs quite well on regular (87), but on this chart
would demand between 92 and 96.

 Hi David,

 Don't know what brake thermal efficiency is, maybe someone else does.  
 At 7.6:1 a Type 1 slips in there just a tad above regular and a notch below
high test.  Maybe Plus ?

I sure wish that link told you what octane numbers they were. 
They are either Reseach Octane Number or Motor Octane Number. My guess is
RON. RON is higher than MON.
They are not the octane number of pump gasoline.
What you buy at the pumps in the USA is RON + MON divided by 2.
