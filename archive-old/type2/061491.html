Subject: Josh

I was one of the fortuneate people who got to meet Josh face to face. I had
corresponded with him occasionally via e-mail. I hadn't known of the list for
very long and it was nice to find another &quot;bus nut&quot;, besides myself and Rob,
that only lived 70 miles up the road from me. This certainly called for a road
trip so Rob Dahlgren and I headed over to Ponca City in Rob's 69 combi. I can't
say anything about the man that hasn't already been said. He was knowledgable
but not all knowing. Like a sponge, he would soak up new information as fast as
you could give it to him. Polite, inquisitive, soft spoken, an all around nice
person. I'm glad he got to come to my home in Bartlesville and see my 71 bus. I
only wish that after 5 years or so since it came out of the body shop looking
more than fresh that I would have had it ready for him to drive. My
procrastination has finally caught up with me. I wish I had more time to get to
know him better. Have him over for a homebrew and talk VW's or whatever. He
truly will be missed. Cheers Josh!!! I hope you find peace.
