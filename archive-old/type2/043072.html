Subject: wind wing tightening

there is actually a tightening screw on the bottom post of the vent wing 
frame.....same for the back vents...my back vent post had corroded away and 
i had to replace it with a non-adjustable heater box clamp and 
valve-adjusting screw...anyways, be sure to grease these up as regular 
maintenance so they won't rust..
