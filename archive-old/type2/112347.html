Subject: When is Every Bus in N.C. ?

Would someone be willing to share with me a little about this event? 
When it occurs,roughly how many buses,need reservations,any kids there, 
etc? I read a few things in the archives and it seems like it must be 
in the spring. Would be a 700 mile trip for me from Mobile, AL., but 
sounds as if it must be close to my hometown of Burlington, NC,(just 
outside Greensboro). Sounds like a fun event, and i could also visit 
family up there.
