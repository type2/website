right

 That fan I'm
&gt; assuming draws OUTSIDE air from UNDERNEATH the car, pulls it THROUGH the oil
&gt; cooler, through that aluminum tubing in front of the motor (which is two
&gt; cast pieces of aluminum bolted together... draws it through the fan, and out
&gt; the back of the engine compartment towards that little vent area.

Nope, other way around.  Draws air from those vents up high in the rear
corners of the bus through the engine bay and then pushes it over the
cylinders and oil cooler and then out the bottom of the bus,

&gt; I'm thinking... I'd really like to install a set of fans.. maybe one over
&gt; each cyl head (so two..) They would be spaced maybe a couple inches from the
&gt; cyl head, and I could rig it up so that when I notice the cyl head
&gt; temperatures getting too high, I could switch on the fans and it would cool
&gt; it.. right? Would this disrupt the original air flow design of the motor?

Nope, keep the stock VW system.  electric fans don't move enough air at
all!
