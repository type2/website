Subject: Re: Oil pressure sender relocation kit

I wouldn't be too concerned about vibration. However, proximity to the
distributor may be an issue. If you look at Steve Dolan's installation with
enlarged hole in the tin, the dizzy and the oil pressure sender are really
close. Raising the oil pressure sender, may make this area even more
crowded. Also, on a dual carb engine, this is where the throttle cable runs.
Not a big deal if you have the tall early intake manifolds. But you may run
into clearance issues with the short manifolds - like those used on dual
carb Vanagons.

My EUR 0.017 worth ...

I've been thinking about making a short fitting that is M10 male on
one end and M10 female with flats on the other so the oil pressure
sender can simply stand off rather than require a long hose to
relocate it elsewhere. The fitting would be the same size of the hole
in the oil pressure sender grommet to the tin would remain sealed.

Does anyone think vibration will be an issue? I just want to raise
the sender just enough so it can be tightened easily.
