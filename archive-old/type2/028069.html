The first bus I ever owned was a '70 westy. The original owner made only one modification to the bus. That was to add hole to under the rear bed cushion, above the oil filler hole. The hole was plugged with a plastic plug that fit perfectly.

In the bottom of the closet, he kept a funnel and a length of tubing in a heavy plastic bag.

This set-up worked very well for the many years I owned this bus. The trick was that the hole was carefully cut to fit the black, plastic plug. If VW had thought of it, this might have been a factory option, it was so well-done.

Thanks! Joe
