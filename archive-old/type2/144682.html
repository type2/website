&gt; &gt; I think I don't understand. I thought because a smaller 4 cylinder engine
&gt; &gt; runs at higher RPMs to make power that it would have LESS time for
&gt; &gt; combustion... My VW Cabrio runs at 3500 rpm, a big V-8 in the family runs at about 2200
&gt; &gt; rpm for the same vehicle speed.

I think that the phrase left out is &quot;of equal displacement&quot;.  Such an
engine would have slower rpm allowing more time for combustion.  However,
by the same logic the best engine would be a single-cylinder engine with a
trash-can sized piston.

I smell an overgeneralization, which isn't unexpected on that site.
