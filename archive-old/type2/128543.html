Subject: Re: [T2] New dual carbs. Linkage binding.

Paul, is it binding or just not returning with the carb springs? You might need to add an additional return spring like the OEM EFI system used. Lowe's has them. 

Do this - can you move the linkage side to side any at all - compressing those end springs any? If so then shortening the crossbar is not going to net you anything beside slop. If it is locked in tight, then the crossbar prob does need to be shortened, thinner lock nuts, etc. You could do away the lock nuts at all and just try the Locktite alone. If you can push it side to side then don't shorten anything and just add a return spring to the arm that the cable attaches to. I had to do that with mine (dual Dellorto DRLA on BAS (Ahnendorp) linkage) in my Beetle on teh Type IV. 

Does it bind without the links that bolt on to the carbs? That is does it bind with just the crossbar alone?

One thing I did not see and I think now you might ought to add (and would benefit you installation) are phenolic spacers. These are 3/16&quot; thick fiber blocks that go on top of the gasket on the head we installed last night. The spacer, then another gasket on top and then the manifold. Will add about 1/4&quot; to the height of the carb installation and limit the transfer of heat to the manifolds in the summer (a good thing). As Andy mentioned, it will in effect move the carbs apart giving you more room for the linkage cross bar. DEFINITELY use flat washers under those nuts to keep them from - like Dave and Andy mentioned - cracking. 

Maybe search of Phenolic+VW or Phenolic+carb

It was a breezy 35 miles drive home with the top down last night at 75 mph - COOL weather. Was glad to get home and inside and into bed... 

See ya.
