I installed one on my 73 Transporter.  At the beggining I was a bit
afraid
because the carbs didn´t have a fuel returning system to the tank but I
conected a filter with return by pass and that solved the problem.  I
instaled
a relay  and conected it to the (+) of the coil.  It works great and at
iddle
the carbs do not choke.  Good choice !.  I have some pictures that I
once
mentioned in the list that I was going post but I don´t have a scanner
and
havn´t had the time to look for one.   Good luck !!.
