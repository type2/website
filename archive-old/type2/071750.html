Hello,

I still believe that it is a clutch assembly problem and
not transaxle per se.  Was the clutch package a name
brand such as Sachs or was it of unknown origin?   And
did it look the same as the one you took out?

Not that I wouldn't like to sell you a gearbox but I'd look
at the clutch first!

PS- Clutch still feels fine huh???  If you do end up needing
 a transaxle just post me a note.  I have them on the shelf
 already rebuilt and ready to install.
