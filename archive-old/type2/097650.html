Hi Chris, &amp; Craig,

    You might give this a try. While laying on a creeper, have someone
&quot;bounce&quot; the corner in question up and down. While the noise is happening,
very carefully &quot;feel&quot; each joint on the side making noise. There should be a
roughness, enough to feel in a dry or rough bushing, bearing, dry ball
joint, etc. Again be very careful where you put your hand/fingers.
    Once you find the culprit then you can make up your mind if you want to
fix it your self or go back to &quot;Brand X&quot; auto repair. This could be
something as simple as a dry bushing you can lube.
    Good luck.
