Subject: What to fix first?

I am seeking your advice on what to do and in what order regarding my son's
new project.
the bus he obtained had been sitting for about 3-4 years.
I was able to get it running by cleaning the points and replacing the
battery.
I know I need to replace the cap, rotor, wires, plugs and change the oil.
There was no gas in the tank when we got it.
The inline electric fuel pump works.
I will also change the fuel filter and the fuel lines.

What else do I need to consider changing or servicing.

Also, what is the size of screw that holds the points in the distributor?
The hole is stripped out and I am trying to figure out how to remedy that.
bigger screw, lock washer, lock-tite??
any thoughts

Thanks,
Jim
