Subject: I am adventuring in a giant vw yard

Hey everybody,
I have gone crazy looking for parts for my Type2 and Type3.  I decided,
since I got layed off, that I would work a few days a week at Reborn Parts
(http://www.rebornparts_dot_com).

I found a treasure trove of parts that are warehoused.  Besides that there
are at least 100 T2s in the yard!  If you are looking for parts, these
guys would be the ones to ask.

You can call them at 719/633-9966.  Email them at sales_at_rebornparts_dot_com

Take care and happy VeeDubbing!
