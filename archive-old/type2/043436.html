Subject: Yet another post on tires

&lt;disclaimer&gt;
I checked the archives and have seen tons of posts on
this subject.  I found the correct size and brand,
called some places.  Not in stock, not made anymore.
&lt;/disclaimer&gt;

So, I called around to a few more places, explaining
*exactly* what I needed, and most told me nope, sorry,
don't have nuthin' for one of those hippie buses. 
Argh!  

I called my friends at the Tire Rack and a nice woman
named Wendy found exactly what I was looking for -
Bridgestone 603V, 8 ply load range D.  She told me
that this was a pretty nice tire.  Price? $373.38 USD
for 5.  Then I called around to see how much mounting,
etc. would be if I brought my own tires in.  Most
places will charge me between $15-$25/tire.

Then I called up the local Bridgestone/Firestone place
- couldn't find them when I gave him the exact
Bridgestone part number.  Hmmm, so I explained what I
needed and voila! he found the mysterious 603V.  Price
was $472.60 USD for 5, mounted, etc.  For another 5
bucks each, I can get road hazard insurance.  So, for
a little under $500, I can get 5 new tires, that fit,
and have road hazard.  Seems pretty good to me.

Any and all comments are welcome.  

Paul
