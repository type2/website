Subject: To buy 82 Campmobile Deluxe

Lately I have been playing musical busses trying to find an extra bus for
going to auctions, home depot etc since my 75 Campmobile doesn't have the
room.  Well last night I found a brown 82 that has the following problems.
The speedometer and Tach don't work.  Has an extractor muffler system so no
catalytic converter.  Might need new tires.  Otherwise this is pretty good,
guy says it has 100,000 on original engine but shows 91,000.  Camper is
complete minus curtains and the front most table.  I am going to offer to
pay for inspection to see what it really needs before purchase.  What else
should I look for.  Marylanders can I pass w/out the Cat. How hard and
expensive is it to fix the speedo and odometer.  Additionally, I have posted
on the net that my van will be for sale.  This is tentative on if I buy this
other van, because it can serve both purposes camper/hauler.   

75 Yosemite Yellow Camper. Has stove,sink, fridge! Has 6,000 on rebuilt
engine.Gets 18-21mpg. Year old heat exchangers, new shocks. Have extra blue
green plaid material, front seats are blue velour at the moment which is
actually very cool. Has four legged stool. All curtains. Added upper cabinet
from a 76-79 for more storage space. Has very little rust, if any it is
mostly surface! Kenwood cassette player w/4 speakers. Childscot, (2) small
tables for front and in between the sink &amp; Fridge. Has the dinner tabel. Has
rear bug screen. My wife and I love this bus so it will only go to a good
Aircooled loving home. $5,800 OBO


Thanks for all help,

Patrick Flynn
