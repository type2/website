Subject: [T2] restoration process

Hi listees and gurus,

I have a 72 bay window bus that I want to restore and I am looking for 
suggestions on how to proceed.  The engine is good, as well as the other 
mechanical aspects except for the heater fan.  The fan works but the switch 
does not.  The fuse in the engine compartment has been cut out which I 
replaced but still no luck.  I get heat, but I really want a defroster in the 
front on rainy days.  Any ideas?  

Anyway, the interior is good in most parts and I have found places to replace 
most of the bad stuff.  The only real rust is in the inside of the 
windshield, no holes, just rust.  Can the piece that is in-between the 
windshield and the dash be replaced?  In regard to painting; do I paint 
inside and the outside?  I want to replace the window rubber, should this be 
done before or after painting?  I will have a professional do the work.  
Should I do the interior work before the painting or after or does it really 
matter?  

This is my daily driver and as I will have the exterior done professionally, 
I know of  and am not really worried too much about the cost.  This is one 
that I will keep for a long, long time.  It is in good shape that I want to 
be restored to showroom perfection.  Any help on what to do first or last 
will be truly appreciated.

Thanks in advance,
Rob
