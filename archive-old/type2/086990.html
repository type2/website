&gt; I've come to the conclusion that my poor shifting has
&gt; something to do with a bus that sat for 6 years,
&gt; producing likely yucky fluid and possibly a clogged
&gt; tranny filter.  Is there anyone who has done this
&gt; service recently and can comment on the complexities
&gt; of it.  I am certain that the pan has to come off,
&gt; other than that, I do not know what to do next or what
&gt; to buy.  I have Bentley, Muir, Haynes, Chilton, and
&gt; Clymer.  I just don'y know which one to use for this
&gt; task!  The bus is a 78 3 speed automatic passenger
&gt; soon to be Westfakia.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks and Kindest Regards,
