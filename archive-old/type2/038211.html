Subject: Help!  I can't get my 71 Westy to idle!

OK, here is the scenario:

I purchased a 71 Westy that had been sitting for 10 years for $500.  I towed
it home, bought a battery, rebuilt the carb, drained the fuel, added new
fuel lines, rebuilt the carb, new cap, rotor, points, spark plug wires,
spark plugs.  I have no vacuum leaks that I know of (I tested this by simply
blocking off the vacuum holes with rubber boots and it made no difference).
It seems to run just fine but will not idle.  Any input will be appreciated.
Thanks.  I am new to the VW thing.  I was a fuel injection guy....
