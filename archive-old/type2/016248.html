Subject: FS: '80-'85 brake rotors.

Subject says it all a pair of brand new in the box US made Bendix rotors
for the early vanagon, I guess '80-'85.  These are nice quality well machined
US rotors, not German but not south of the border junk either.  I sold the
'82 before I got around to installing these.  Bare obviously (no bearing
races.)

Bus Depot seems to want $50 each for probably Italian, I'd say these are
equal quality.

I'd sort of like $35 obo, and want to sell them as a set, plus actual shipping
from Clarksburg, WV which is liable to be pricey depending on where you
are (about 40 lb total.)

Thanks
John
