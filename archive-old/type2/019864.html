Subject: Exhaust gaskets

Hi all;
   Getting around to installing the exhaust system on my much delayed
'78 Westy project. Question, has anyone experimented with using copper
gaskets? I have a supply of thin copper sheets, a well equipped shop and
the tools to duplicate the exhaust gaskets in copper.
   Has anybody tried this? Good idea or just a pipe dream? It's not that
the factory gaskets are expensive or anything like that, it just seems
to me copper would hold up better in the long run.
   Comments?
