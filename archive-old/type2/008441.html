Hi folks.
I have just fitted my nice newly reconditioned flaps/thermostat
assembly to my engine and doesn't it look good. Thanks again Andy for
supplying the flaps. Now, I have a question, Andy managed to supply me
with the flaps, rod, connecting links etc but had neither the thermostat
or it's mounting bracket. No problem, I'll pop down to VW and get them,
again, no problem. BUT, the thermostat was £34.50, nice bit o kit mind.
I know that I can buy thermostats for about 9 or ten quid, now what's
the difference, are the after market thermostats not as good or what.
Has anyone out there ever compared an original German VW thermostat and
an after market one? I will be buying a £9.50 one to put in the
spares box for emergencies (at £34.50 it should last forever!!).
Incidentally the bracket was only 9 quid!!
