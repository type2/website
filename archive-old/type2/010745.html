&gt;  The immediate problem with my linkage is the rear coupling. The pressed
&gt;  steel housing came unbuckled. It's turning out to be a real hassle to 
buckle
&gt;  back the way it should be. Not sure if the housing is the cause of my
&gt;  shifting woes, or an effect. We'll see.

Hi Phil,

If the rear coupling isn't in good condition then that will cause all sorts 
of problems with gear changing. My previous post assumed (and thats always 
dangerous) that the parts of the system which is are visible for inspection 
were in good condition.

If the rear coupler is broken its realy not worth trying to fix as they are 
both cheep and easily availlable.

Good luck
