I guess that the main thing that appealed to me about the HVLP systems, =
from the information on that first page, is the lack of &quot;bounce&quot; and =
overspray, dust and paint waste. I have a very limited area in which to =
paint.. basically a two car garage with plastic drop sheets to help =
reduce overspray. I could hook up a ventilation system of sorts. I have =
a pretty high volume air exhaust fan and I could get some ducting pretty =
cheap. Right now, I have six vehicles that would all greatly benefit =
from a paint job. I could take them to a painting shop.. we have a One =
Day nearby. That's what I was going to do originally. But all of these =
except one, a bug, are vans or bigger. Those don't get the bargain =
rates. $$$ So, I thought maybe that this is something worth getting =
into. Even if I broke even on the cost of the system and paint, if I =
owned the system when I was done, that would be cool.=20
Well, I am not an experienced painter, and that is sure going to make a =
difference in the results I get. I do have a standard spray gun that I =
bought from a local auto-paint auto-body store.. we have a few of those =
around, too. We also have a nice portable compressor. So, I could go =
with that, but I got the impression that a novice could get a better =
result with less mess from an HVLP system.=20
Any more thoughts? TIA.. Jan B
