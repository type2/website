Subject: 5 Days of twisty roads

My wife finally got my daugters and neice together (teenage girls pack to much stuff), the bus was loaded, checked and rechecked, so off we went.  We left Eugene , Or last Monday and made it back last night, Friday night.  Poor Albert my 69' Riveria was squating pretty good as we head north up hiway 101.  But he sounded and felt good.  Twist, turn, twist, turn, up and down...this is one wild road!  We stopped in Newport and saw the Willie Whale and bummed around the aquarim &lt;sp&gt;. Kids back in the bus and off we head for Bayshore SP.  Damn, it's full!!  Drive some more and we found ourselves in Lincon City.  Devils Lake campgroup!!  Squeal &lt;brakes&gt;, flat spot, set up tent, yell at kids to go to sleep..sore.  Up at 6:00, coffee, kids up at 8:00, on the road at 9:00.  More twists and turns, we made Cape Look Out by 11:00!  This is one nice camp ground with beach access, showers, and I actually found a camp site with grass and a same tree!  Wife and kids split, it's up to Dad to s!
et up camp.  They have a ranger type movie at 9:30 pm, so off the kids go.  Mom and I head for the bus &lt;smile&gt;.  We left the next day, taking our time, heck it's only 65 miles to Astoria.  The map fails to mention that it's almost straight up!  It took almost 3 hours to drive the 65 miles.  My arms looked somewhat Popeye like as I exited the Bus.  Astoria is a neat little town that gets invaded by Hollywood every now and then.  Free Willie, Short Circuit, Kindergarten Cop, Goonies, and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles 3 were shot here.  And of course the kids had to see everything!  The houses are outrageous, the streets narrow and steep!  Very steep!  After 3 hours of up and down my entire 25 years plus years of driving muscles were reduced to jelly.  That's it!  Dad has had enough!  We head for Washington state.  My thoughts were to cut through Washington and head to the outskirts of Portland, Oregon.  No luck, I was beat.  We roll into to Paradise Point SP and stop at the range!
r's office.  Mom comes back, she does all the talking to rangers, and we prepare to go look for a spot.  I turn the key, idiot lights beam, gauges swing, but not starter noise.  I yell at the kids to shut up and try again, nothing.  At this point I am slightley angry.  I don't care why Albert doesn't start, I just grabbed a metal tent stake and slide under the bus.  I jump the starter and off we go.  Flat site, tent up, I'm out like a light.  The next morning everybody complained about traffic noise, except me!  Loaded up, I turn the key, Albert starts!  On the road again, and soon we cross back into Oregon.  Turns out we saved 30 miles by staying in Washington and blowing off the Portland area campground!  Massive civilazation!  I areadly miss the Oregon coast.  We roll into the Washington Park Zoo, why the Portland zoo is named this I do not know.  It's hot, and the day is filled with quiet, fuzzy animals and loud, wild, kids.  I get depressed at the zoo and start humming th!
e song &quot;Born Free&quot;.  We head out of the zoo at about 6:00pm after I jump the starter again.  My main objective is to get out of Porland as fast as possible.  I tryed a little to fast!  I rounded a corner and the right lane traffic was at a dead stop!  I swung into the left lane and vainly tried to slow the bus down.  Finially slowed Albert down.  Wonderig how I was gonna get back into the  exit lane, when I saw a Thing.  My wife motioned to hime and a space was soon made.  Thanks brother!  We stopped at Champoeg SP and stayed in the rich part.  Little Albert awash in a sea for large RV's.  I wish I had brought something to plug in, we were the only people without a TV  on our picnic table.  The sun raises and so do I, pancakes and coffee going, nice fire.  Kids feed and washed, bus packed, Albert starts!  Homeward bound!  Then the wife gets the idea of stopping by Enchanted Forest.  Place is built on a hill, but I soon reverted to my childhood and my kids had trouble keeping u!
p with me!  We finished up at about 5:00 pm.  Albert no start!  Tent stake, brrrrrrmmmm.  Off we go.  Home to good old Eugene at about 6:00pm.  
   We saw the wonders of the Oregon coast, the worlds smallest habor, the worlds shortest river, and some of the most beutiful sencery.  The trip was well worth it.  Albert my 69 camper was flawless except for the start gig.  His mightly single port did not use one drop of oil!  We didn't go fast and had that nice big windshield to see the world through.  Would I do it again, you bet!  But next time the kids stay with there Grand Dad....&lt;chuckle&gt;

Peace, Love, and time to clean and wash Albert..he deserves it!
