&gt;However, I think you should add to change the oil filter after draining
&gt;the ATF-10w oil. In my experience this shouldn't be too hazardous to the
&gt;engine if all you do is warm it up and then drain the oil: DON&quot;T DRIVE
&gt;IT or load the engine in any way. Also this applies only to gas engines


Al, forwards these wise opinions, I I note I had forgot to mention changing
the filter with the oil change, a must of course, just sort of something I'd
do regardless with the change to the ATF and with the change back to oil.
As to whether or not to drive it, well I've done it both ways, but would
probably only do the drive like I said, level with little or no stops, only
for about 15 minutes, keeping the rpm off of idle, and only really in a bus
with gages to monitor.  I also should have mentioned, only on a nice cool
weather day, say 65F ambient at the most.  Thing is that sitting there an
air cooled engine even in 10 or fifteen minutes can generate a lot of heat
without moving and the ram effect from the air scoops, so I don't know which
is really worse.  As I sort of indicated this whole procedure can really be
frought with peril and is sort of a &quot;quicky&quot; fix, but is better than dumping
in a can of some sort of naptha based wonder cleaner IMHO.  Like I said, you
sort of got to have in the back of your mind that doing this may cure the
lifters and soon lead to a nasty ticking from the bottom end, it is a
realistic possibility, but then again all VW engines, but particularly the
T4 and wasserboxers with the aluminum cases are pretty stout down on the
bottom ends.  Anyway definitely something where YMMV and it can be a $1500
engine hanging in the sling.
