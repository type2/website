Subject: Engine to Tranny - 3 bolts?

What a glorious weekend. It reached the high sixties and I spend two days
working on my VWs SHIRTLESS.

I cleaned and sealed my dune buggy gas tank with the POR15 gas tank kit and
coated the outside with POR15.

I also pulled the engine from my '71 bus and I had the Bentley manual and
the &quot;How to Rebuild Your VW Engine. . &quot; book close at hand. I was surprised
when I read in the Bentley manual that on the '71 bus ONLY 3 BOLTS HOLD THE
ENGINE TO THE TRANSMISSION! The &quot;How to Rebuild. . .&quot; book said that the
upper left bolt had to be removed from underneath. This is the same bolt not
referenced by the Bentley manual - apparently the one that is not needed?

Now my engine is not the original. It's a Mexican AS41 but it does indeed
have 4 bolts but the upper left bolt needed a wrench on both sides to undo
it (no easy task) and it was obvious that this was not an original bolt (too
small and too long). The upper right bolt needed a vicegrip on the D-shaped
(starter) side because it just spun (also no easy task).

Since the books seem to contradict each other, which one is correct? Does a
stock '71 only need 3 bolts? If so I'd like to leave the upper left off due
to the PITA (pain in the _at_$$) factor.
