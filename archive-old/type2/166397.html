Subject: [T2] Trip report and updated pictures (trip/bodywork)

Hello all,

I just came back from a holiday trip to Corsica (island in the
Mediterranean). Two weeks, 3000 miles, beautiful weather, beaches and
ocean. If you're interested in (only a few) pictures (that feature my
bus) check here:

The spare cylinder head (used, unknown mileage, I was low on money) I
put on in July (because of a dropped #3 intake valve seat) did not last
long. When driving through the mountains in Switzerland I noticed a
gradually loss of power. Checked compression, this time it's #4 that has
low compression readings. But I did not want to cancel the trip (had
already booked the ferry) and kept on driving (keeping a close eye on
cylinder head temp and oil temp). Bus made it around whole Corsica and
all the way back home without any problems (had to drive a bit slower
than normally).

This cylinder head should only be a non-permanent fix to commute to
work, but since I got the chance to take 2 weeks of holidays, I just
dared to go.
I have to replace both heads anyway, so that's a task for the winter
time.

I found some older pictures from doing the bodywork on my bus that can
be viewed here:

Cheers,

Timo
