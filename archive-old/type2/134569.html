Subject: Re: [T2] Don's CV boots -- let's get serious here

&gt; The BusDepot kit for 9.95 DOES include bolts and grease so no further 
&gt; expense is needed.

The other question is do they have the washer and do they have the clamp for 
the shaft side of the boot and do they come with a new snap-ring. That is a 
complete kit.

&gt;They'll take only a few hours to do and require no special tools (easier 
&gt;with certain tools but not required).

Let's be honest here, cv boots are a pain in the ars. A lot of people can't 
or won't do it. It is really really messy and tricky. Special tools are 
required, the twelve point socket head, is really hard to find.

You can run into all kinds of problems with this job that could leave you 
hanging.
Strip out a bolt and you have to cut it off. (need new bolt and hack saw)

You can have a hard time pulling off the snap-ring.

You can twist the bearing too far and all the balls fall out, then what do 
you do?

How are you going to clean all the old grease out?


&gt;Good luck Don- if you need help to do it faster by someone who just did it, 
&gt;come on over- you know &gt;where I live.

I think its great that everyone is trying to help out. Take it from someone 
who does it for a living, you can always run into problems with these. One 
job is not like the other. I'd say 75% of the buses on the road have bad 
boots, even worse, more of them have bad ball joints.
