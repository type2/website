&gt;I was looking at the linkage for the air flap before the air cooler and I
&gt;never realized before the flaps work asymmetrically. When the right flap is
&gt;down the left flap is up and vice versa.  I can't quite visualize how the
&gt;oil cooler and the 3/4 cylinder bank gets max air at the same time.

Also notice that the 3/4 side duct in the fan housing is larger than the 
1/2 side.  That's to account for the extra percentage of air that the oil 
cooler gets when the flaps are open.  When the 3/4 flap is open, it is 
covering the oil cooler and air enters from the rear (FIF).
