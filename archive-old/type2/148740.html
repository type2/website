Subject: 73 bus carb cutoff solenoid?

seems this vehicle is running out of gas much too quickly...
 when starting, it is flooded. You have to crank it a bit
before it will ignite, and then let it run for a minute
before pressing on accelerator (if you press it too soon,
you flood it and it stalls)
 Dual Solex carbs. carb on left side has a ?solenoid? that
is loose. This causes vacuum leak and I believe is the
source of the starting problems (IE, gas leaks into cylinders
when engine is off).
 Anyone have good diagrams of solex carb? It looks like
this solenoid is threaded into the carb, and perhaps the
threads are stripped.
 Jen
