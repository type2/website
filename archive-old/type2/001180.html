Subject: engine tin help!

This sounds trivial,  but you will all agree on the importance of this part.
I desperately need a piece of engine tin for my 77 westy.  There are NO vw's
in the junkyards in my area.  There will be one less bus on the road this
summer if I dont come up with the LEFT REAR CORNER ENGINE TIN.
Its a really nice bus and AVP is sending my newly rebuilt engine,  but I am
leaving the A/C off and this leaves a gaping, fume-sucking,
engine-overheating hole into the engine compartment.
How does one come up with a VERY important part like this if you dont live
in Cali?  I guess the profit margin is too low for any mail-order venders to
sell or repro these.  SO... If you have my apparently-ultra-rare piece(LOL),
please contact me before you delete!  I'd give ten times the 2-bucks that
its worth at this point for a nice rust-free piece.  Will pay for
shipping...will name my next bus after you....somebody...anybody, HELP!

77 Westy
The bus came by and I got on. Thats when it all began.
