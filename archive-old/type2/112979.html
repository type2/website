Subject: FW: BIG DAY for the Golden Gate chapter

Sorry for the non Bus content. As most of you have probably heard, the
last Beetle will roll out of the factory in Puebla tomorrow. Last
weekend a number of members from the local club that I belong to got
together with their Beetles for a shoot that you can read about below.
Please note that the date has been changed to tonight on ABC.  And, here
are some shots of the event at the club site:

&gt;
&gt; Hi to all:
&gt; Our club had a very big event this past Saturday:  we were
&gt; interviewed, and our cars filmed, for a segment on World News Tonight
&gt; about the end of Beetle manufacturing.  The clip will air at the end
&gt; of Peter Jennings' news program  THIS WEDNESDAY night, July 30th, at
&gt; 5:30pm.
&gt;
&gt; We had probably 14-16 cars there, and maybe 30 people.  The filming
&gt; took over 4 hours, and was held at Rick Spohn's house/acreage in San
&gt; Martin.  It was hotter than blazes that day, over 100 degrees, and we
&gt; stood out in the sun in front of our cars.  The oldest models were
&gt; parked in a semicircle in front, the next-oldest behind them, and the
&gt; newer versions in back.  Both of my Beetles, my '69 Sedan Bogart and
&gt; my '58 Convertible Oscar participated.
&gt;
&gt; Rick started the interview with a history of the club, Jan Peters said
&gt; a few things, then the rest of us were able to chime in any time we
&gt; had something to say.  The interviewer was a guy named Bill, who I
&gt; recognized from newscasts on KGO news in years past.  He would ask
&gt; pointed questions, and then we'd answer.  It was more like a
&gt; conversation than an interview and went very well.
&gt;
&gt; It was terribly exciting to be able to be part of this great event and
&gt; also to be part of something that will note &quot;the passing&quot; of our air
&gt; cooled cars.  Be sure to tune into World News Tonight this Wednesday
&gt; at 5:30pm, and watch Peter Jennings' report!
