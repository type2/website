Subject: Kristen Laurite Killer, trial update

Folks,

Saw this in the newspaper yesterday...finally.

http://www.nwarktimes_dot_com/adg/News/192903

The killer pleaded &quot;no contest&quot; and was supposed to be sentenced 
yesterday.

If you go to http://www.nwarktimes_dot_com/

and search for &quot;laurite&quot; you will get all the stories, including
the one on Thursday mornings sentencing.

Went thu 400+ posts this morning to make sure it wasn't a reposty.



Cheers, dave
