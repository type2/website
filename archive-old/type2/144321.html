Subject: Getting to Alternator Bolt on Frankinstiened 72 Bus

Hi Folks,

The alternator bolt fell off my bus, so I'm trying to
get it back on.  I have a 72 bus with 72 parts on the
engine (engine is 2cc FI - not stock). The pipe coming
from the heat exchanger to the engine compartment is
in the way of the alternator bolt. I can get my
fingers on the bolt enough to get the nut onto the
bolt. But because the pipe I mentioned is in the way I
can't get my thumb up there!  I can't get any tools up
there either, not on the nut.  I think I need to
remove the pipe that's in the way. Can I do this
without removing too many bolts?? I DON'T have a shop.
Just a driveway, so go easy on me.  I don't want to
have to remove the entire heat exchanger to just get
this pipe out of the way.  Any thoughts or ideas???

Thanks,

Rae
Rudy - 72 bus with 76 FI 2cc
