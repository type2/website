Subject: Fuel Pump rebuild kit source?

Hi folks,

Does anyone know a source for rebuild kits for 1600cc type I-style fuel
pumps?  I think Bob mentioned Barret Ent. awhile back but I don't have a
phone #/city/state for them.  Also, does anyone know what the pump rebuild
kit includes?  I have a part number of 113 127 141 for the diaphram w/
spring &amp; collar--I guess that would be the main item needing replacement. 

I think new Brazilian pumps go for something like $15-$25 (these are the
crimped-on cover-nonrebuildable type).  The earlier type with screws holding
the diaphram cover in place are rebuildable.  If the kit is only a few $ I
could put some of my old pumps to good use.

If anyone is interested, I have an article from a 70's Petersen's VW How To
book that details how to inspect/rebuild your fuel pump (it's mostly common
sense).  

Also, while I have your ear, can someone post the number for Rimco in
California?

Thanks,

Ron
