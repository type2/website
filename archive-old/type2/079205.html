&gt; that's what is happening when I press on the clutch. wah wah wah wah
&gt; wah..   Sometimes it's also doing it when I press lightly on the clutch
&gt; or not even pressing on it.. .. is this the T/O bearing going out?
&gt;
&gt; What kinda ETA am I looking at until spontaneous kaboom occurs and the
&gt; thing dies?  I NEEEEEEEED to go try to pass smog tomorrow and the bus
&gt; started making this noise friday... on and off.. not too bad.. tonight a
&gt; little bit louder..
&gt;
&gt; I think Steve Dolan posted something about this a while back, but I
&gt; couldn't find the post.. any input would be nice :)
