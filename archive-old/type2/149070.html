Kevin,

I just talked to Dawn yesterday.  She has been away from home, but is
headed home soon.  I can assure you she WILL send you what you
ordered.  I know it is frustrating when people don't respond (and they
have your money), but she is a very small operation and I think she
has been dealing with some things lately.

&gt; Well after 2.5 months, 2 emails, and trying to call Dawn _at_ her # posted
&gt; on the website 602-315-0952 (it's disconnected) I have no other

&gt; run for the border but I want to warn the list not to do business with
&gt; PLF as she has apparently disappeared. If anyone knows of another
&gt; source for a poptop canvas for a early bay  please let me know.
