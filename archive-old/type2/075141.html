Subject: Re: [T2] brake stuff. I dont know what im talking about....

&gt;&gt; Remove the shoes, a bit of an annoyance, but not hard. (admittedly they
&gt;&gt; get easier with experience...).  Unbolt the old wheel cyl, be very gentle
&gt;
&gt;I would like to point out one thing. Do one side at a time. This gives
&gt;you the luxuary of looking at the still assembled side and saying to
&gt;yourself &quot;well, shoot. I guess that part does actually go on like that&quot;
&gt;instead of guessing and perhaps being wrong. :) Good luck.

That is sound sound advice.  The Bus system is pretty darn simple
actually as there isn't much to it, no auto adjuster system etc.  But
I recall years ago taking apart my uncles Chevy rears both at once
with like an elaborate auto adjuster mechanism, 8 springs, etc, etc.
Needless to say I didn't just remember how it went back together,
and had to go to the library and get a terrible little picture out of a
Chiltons.  Always helps to just leave one side together.  Also to
the original poster, I think it is wise sometimes to shy away from the
locally available Varga wheel cylinders, I've had spotty luck.  The
Italian ones Ron had were nicely done though, a bit odd form factor
but work well.  And regardless which way you go do both of the rears
and purge your fluid changing to Castrol GT/LMA DOT4, you will
be happy for having done it.

PS Of course I was redoing my tow dolly and took both sides right
apart.....  We never really learn 8-)
