&gt; Last week I drove my bus a good distance in the pouring rain.  It was about
&gt; a 3 hour drive.  When I got to my destination I set my emergency brake and
&gt; left the bus for the weekend.  When I got back two days later, I started up
&gt; the bus and attempted to drive away... but my right rear wheel was locked up
&gt; so I could not move.
&gt; 
&gt; I suspected that my emergency brake has somehow rusted to the drum and was
&gt; causing this, so I got out my trusty hammer (yes.. the same hammer that
&gt; helps me in hot start situations) and gave my wheel a few good whacks.  The
&gt; wheel was now free and I was able to drive away.
&gt; 
&gt; My question is.. is this a normal occurrence in wet weather? Or do I have a
&gt; big problem to worry about?  I had the brakes done about 4000 miles ago.. so
&gt; I would assume they are in good shape.


It seems to be, and it seems to be more severe when the brake shoes are
well-arced to the drums.  Some folks say that the culprit is the brake
adjusting holes that originally were plugged up with rubber plugs.

In any case, I don't use my parking brake on wet days (which SoCal seems
to have more of than the PNW these days, but we got even and sent them an
earthquake).
