List friends.........

In less than 24 hours we are taking the first major excursion in our 74
Transporter. 1400 miles in 4 days, from Kentucky to Michigan and back.
That's the plan, anyway.  As far as my skills and your good advice can
determine, the bus is in perfect order: About 1200 miles on the AVP rebuild,
new oil, new tires, all systems operational, no guages (yet). Of course I
will be carrying the usual tools and spare parts, just in case. Any last
minute advice? Warnings? Comments? Two-bit opinions?

Thanks, Dave
74 Transporter, &quot;Rivka&quot;
the original SUV
