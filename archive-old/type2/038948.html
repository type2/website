&gt; Hello,
&gt; I am planning on flushing my brake fluid this weekend and
&gt; was wondering if there is any difference in brand names
&gt; of brake fluid.
&gt; I know I need DOT 3 but besides that I cant decide what to get.
&gt; Would it be wise to go with something well know on this or
&gt; get what ever is on sale at my local FLAPS?

With the possible exception of some very-high-end specialty brake fluids
(for racing perhaps) they are all made to the same specification.

Your bus needs DOT3, but you can also use DOT4 which is the same thing
with a higher boiling point.

Do _not_ use DOT5, as it is a completely different fluid and may be
incompatible with your seals.
