Subject: Splittie parts

I'm trying to find the pan that goes beneath the cab that covers the master cylinder and
cables for a 60-67 bus. All the yards here in Atlanta don't have any splits or they are
on the ground and everyting underneath is rusted-out.

If you have one, you would just need to put it in a box (no fancy packing required) and
I can get UPS to come pick it up (you wouldn't even have to be home). I would pay UPS
when they delivered it to me, and they would send you the check (check can be certified
if you wish.)

I have had some people on the list respond that they had one and then not bother to
respond to any further inquires by me. If you are one of these people, you need not
respond.
