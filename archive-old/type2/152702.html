Subject: Re: [T2] who sells the cheapest TMI headliner

I've gotta side with Richard one this one, at least at far as Type 2
Headliners go. But OTOH, I will go with Courtney on the Beetle Headliners.
 After 35+ years installing headliners in a 50 Bug (Taupe Cloth), 63 Bug
Sedan, 67 Bus 21 Wdw Dlx, 64 Notchback, 69 Camper Bus (Front Section only),
73 Bus and a 68 Bug my opinion is:
 1. Acme does the best job for the Cloth Headliners for the early Bug
Sedans, bar none.
 2. Both Acme &amp; TMI have always made an excellent quality and fitting Vinyl
Headliner for the Bug Sedan. Acme did a *fantastic* job for my Ex-Notch as
well. I've no problems with a TMI on my Ex-68 Bug recently, fit great.
 3. Acme makes the best quality and fitting headlinder for the Bus and
Pickup Models, hands-down, heck they've been producing them for over 40
years. I've yet to get a TMI headlinder fit worth a dang in a Type 2, no
matter what year, they still have a long way to go in fixing their design(s)
and cut(s) for proper fitment. Acme does cost a few bucks more than the TMI,
but here's a situation where I think you get yer money's worth - ya get what
ya pay for.
 4. I have never used a Sewfine *BUT* in talking with several people over
the years who have, I get nothing but high marks for their cut finish and
excellent fitting on Bugs and Buses
 For all the hassle there is installing a headliner, I won't go cheep,
'cause I want it right the first time!
 Of couse Acme and TMI are manufacturers wholesaling to shops only, so ya
gotta check around and see who carries what. I think California Pacific
carries Acme brand, possibly even Bus Depot as well carries (or can get
Acme). The first time I used Acme headliners was around 1968 or so in my
Ex-50 Bug.
 YMMV

&gt; If cheap is your goal go with TMI. Nothing of theirs fits the first

&gt;
&gt; For better products try sewfine (see their doublecab headliner):
