I suggest the Solex 30pict1. It is by far the easiest carb for tuning, reliability and roadside
repairs, until the throttle shaft bushing wears out, then you send it to Mofoco and they'll ream it. On a dual port, you'll need to get the adaptor
plate if you're gonna run the 30pict 1, then you need to do a little filing the the accelerator pump arm has room to move. Good luck

&gt; with a stock cam, exhaust, and 009 which carb &gt;setup work. 
&gt; The question is which carb?  I know some of the &gt;Solex carbs do not work
&gt; well with 009's.
