Nope, that's why they call them rules.  :)

&gt;if you go from a stock VW
&gt;tire (185X60x14) and go to a larger rim and tire say a 215X50X16 the
&gt;difference is about 7.6% to slow or a speedometer difference of about
&gt;4.5 miles faster at 60mph. so if your speedo say 60 you are doing 64.5
&gt;mph. but your engine is only working as hard as it did before to get to
&gt;60 on the older rims and tires.

You are wrong - the engine has to work harder to get the bus to 64.5mph.  This should be obvious.  I think you mean that the engine is turning at the same RPM as it would have at 60 with the smaller tires.  This is true.  It will however require more power to get up to that RPM.  And since the cooling system has not changed, the engine WILL run hotter.

VW engineers know all this and they designed the tire sizes and gear ratios to produce an optimum balance between reliability, performance and efficiency.  Don't think you can second guess them and increase one without decreasing the others.

Did you also know that your mpg will go down when your headlights are on?  Laws of physics again.
