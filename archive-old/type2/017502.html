Hi there, Matilda (71 Westy) just got Kadron 40 mmdual carbs, compufire
ignition, and a bosch 009 distributor.  While tuning her up, I found she
wouldn't run right until the timing was 15 degrees BTDC.  Anything more
retarded and she would hesitate like crazy.  Now she starts great, and runs
great, but I'm worried about the timing being so far past the 5 degrees
ADTC that both the idiots book and Chiltons say is right.  I used static
timing and cross referenced that with the strobe light to rule out operator
error in the timing.  Has anyone else had this experience??  I run 87
octane and live in Wisconsin (NO mountains, no death valley altitides.  Any
ideas??
