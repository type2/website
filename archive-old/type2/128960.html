Subject: Re: [T2]I probably should have listened to my friend.

Is your engine seized up? Well if you can spin it, it's not siezed. It may still be dmaaged. When the oil light comes on, you've got SECONDS to get it turned off. Without oil pressure, the bearings - cam, crank and rod - are ruined. 

Low on oil? You risk ruining the cylinder walls, rocker arm shafts, valve stems, etc. I think I read somewhere wear on the cylinder walls is 30% higher just by running the VW engine 1 quart low... Don't quote me on that though. 

You can be very low on oil and still get the oil pressure light to stay off. I recently helped a neighbor change his cam sals and timing belt on a Chrysler. He had a huge leak losing a quart a day. He wanted to change the oil when we were done and he drained less than a quart of oil out of the engine (a 3.something V-6). SCARY! He said the oil light never came on though... He figured since he was getting ready to change the oil after the seal, he'd let the engine get low on oil so he didn't waste another quart of new oil by driving it with a full crankcase. No lectures from me. 

Our VW's run with a very narrow margin of error on the oil topic. Don't wait for your oil pressure light to tell you that the engine is suffering. By then you've really accelerated the wear by just running it low on oil. 

Your engine: I guess you need to do a FULL tuneup schedule. First run a compression test and a leak down test. I think you'll find you the cylinders or valves are not sealing leading to low compression. Check the ignition and timing and adjust those valves. 

Good luck! 

Chris
