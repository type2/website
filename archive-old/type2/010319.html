Subject: Okay, now for a VERY stupid question from the newbie

Okay, I admit it. I've spent the best part of my 18 years as a &quot;pro&quot;
information gatherer, working in my parents bookstore and scratching my
head through hundreds of new and exciting computer problems. But today, I'm
stumped, despite a number of books and a huge long list of VW internet
sites to rifle through with unrivaled vigour. I don't give up easily. 

I know this is something rather basic, but I was embarased to realize that
I don't know. Now, usually I see the engines in these busses refered to as
1600cc, 1700cc, etc. Seems straight forward enough. But in a number of
places I also see them refered to as 1641, 1776, whatever. Are these just
common oversizes? or is the nice round number (1700cc) an approximation?
What confused me the most is that my Haynes manual shows both numbers on it
as well. 

Help? 

Thanks. 

JT
