Subject: Waffling on FI (was: odd problem with FI system)
Message-ID: &lt;ADCPODPCJKGJBAAA_at_theglobe_dot_com&gt;

Edward brings up two things that I'm concerned with:

- a cheap carb replacement for FI
- setting up a FI system on a test stand

I can give another, perhaps slightly paranoid reason to have a spare carb. Without going into great detail, it has to do with a phenomenon called EMP, which is a side effect of a specific nuclear event that is considered a first-strike tactic for any major attack against the US, China, Russia, India, Israel, and now Pakistan (public info from the internet--I don't know any secrets). In relation to transportation, it will (in addition to shutting down the phone and power grids--all microcircuitry is vulnerable), effectively disable virtually all FI vehicles, with the possible exception, I suspect, of the Motronic FI systems, which don't use an ECU (but maybe those too). If you have a carb as a spare, you have a chance to have a vehicle, at a time when all the running vehicles will be old classics or military vehicles. (Of course, with any luck we'll never see such a scenario.) Okay, so maybe this is a more-than-*slightly* paranoid reason, but I write fiction...so I have an excu!
se...and paranoid though it might be, it is plausible.

On the other hand, I tend to believe the benefits of FI would far outweigh the liabilities, so I've been struggling for some time to get my bus running on FI. I'm also financially challenged, so I have been very hesitant to dish out the required $300-$400 for a carb system...that I'd end up using as a backup...figuring I'd find a cheap used setup. $200 is getting down there, though...so I may check the rags and see how close to that they are now.

Setting up the FI system on a test stand very much intrigues me. I'm wondering how much of this could be done without an engine...that is, by wiring inputs from a carbureted engine...like a lead from the coil and another from the temp sensor. Obviously, you'd have no air flowing through the mass air flow meter, but presumably you could operate the air vane by hand and do some signal measurement...and signaling to the injectors? Anyway, I don't see a really viable way to test the FI system without an engine--and I don't assume that that's what Edward meant--but if there is some range of tests that might be performed in this way, I'd love to hear ideas. Aside from finances, the main reason I haven't bailed on the FI...especially with *all* the various problems and frustration (I've been very close to bailing)...is the liklihood that once I bail I'd never get back to FI.._dot_cause I wouldn't want to take my bus down for it.

Thanks! Joe
