Subject: OCTANE Leaded vs. Un-Leaded

Sorry to even further widen the horizons of this thread but here goes.

From what I have heard from a large number of very reputable Engine
builders...G. Berg and the likes....Leaded gasoline was of a higher Octane
content then today's Un-leaded gas. True or not?  From what I understand even
today's High Octane Un-Leaded gas cannot equal the octane rating of earlier
Leaded gasoline.

The cure for this problem seems to be the lowering of compression in ones
engine.   And lowering the Compression ratio on a stock air-cooled 1600 to
around 6:5-1 to 6:9-1 seems to be the choice of most folks.  I have been also
lowering my compression ratios to this figure on my recent rebuilds (having
seen the effects of detonation on one of my own well cared for, somewhat
short lived motors).  I have yet to run these engines long enough to get a
long term result.

This thread has been kinda foggy and has got me scratching my head.  I have
not heard anything in this thread pertaining to my own question. Which
basically is,.... was Leaded that much higher of an Octane then today's
Un-Leaded and why?  What are the differences between the two in octane?...
and what should one be looking for in today's gas for their old VW?   And is
there really a need for us lowering our compression on old VW motors (that
originally ran on Leaded) or I am I wasting my time lowering compression on a
stock  7:5-1, dual port 1600cc motor?

I will look this up in my Berg manuals next week (great books!) and check
this out more.  I know he covers this in depth.  But, until then any feed
back on this one guys???
