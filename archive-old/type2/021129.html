By flywheel seal I assume you mean the large one, not the o ring?  The
o-ring must also be replaced.  Maybe it got loose and was spinning in
the case and bored it out?  One year doesw not seem old- I first
replaced mine in 94 after 16yrs on the original!  Just did it again
because the clutch lining failed.  Wasn't leaking.  Does another seal
also seem loose?  It's easy to wreck the edge by tapping it in, so I
took a Home Depot electrical department 4&quot; junction box cover and
drilled 5 holes in it matching the holes in the crank.  Greased the
seal, bolted on the plate evenly and seal pushed right in.
