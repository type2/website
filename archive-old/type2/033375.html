&gt; Hi!
&gt; 
&gt; Can someone tell me how to mount the spare wheel at the front of my
&gt; bus? I
&gt; have seen alot of pictures, but non that tells me how to mount it.
&gt; Will the panel hold the wheel without getting to much dents?
&gt; I have seen that some wheels are resting on top of the bumper. I
&gt; guess
&gt; that`s a better way but it don`t 
&gt; look so nice....

There's a bracket that screws to the sheet metal on the front of the
bus and has bolts to accept the wheel.  My bus came with one, but thank
goodness the PO didn't install it!

&lt;caution: religious arguement ahead&gt;

I have very seldom seen a bus that had the spare tire mounted to the
front that did not also have body damage behind the tire.  At the
least, the paint was worn away in places, opening an avenue for rust.

That tire looks like such an oh-so-soft bumper to folks, who then use
it as such. The sheet metal is much softer than the tire and therefore
gets dented. Even if you are ultra-careful yourself, you will still get
nailed by some park-by-Braille idiot eventually.

If you must put the tire outside, you're a lot better off to mount it
to a roof rack, where it will be out of the way and harder to steal. 
When I'm on a long road trip, I carry one tire inside and one on the
rack, as I get way off the beaten path and have been known to get two
flats in a day.

OK, I feel better now!
