&gt; You could say.. &quot;well, the door has lasted this long without rust... what

&gt; it. She keeps a picture of it in her purse to show her friends and
&gt; co-workers. So, I'd like to do whatever I can to make it last for a LONG

The bottom edge of the stock door will rust off over time because of poor
