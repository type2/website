Subject: Marine Battery Box

&gt; If you live in a wet climate, you may want to
&gt; consider putting your 
&gt; battery in a marine-style battery box to keep
&gt; it clean. Keeping your 
&gt; battery and electrical connections clean is a
&gt; helpful part of regular 
&gt; bus maintenance.

It seems to me that this would always be a good
idea, even for people who don't live in rainy
areas.  Corrosion underneath the battery is a
major problem in all acvw's, which would also be
prevented by the marine battery box.
