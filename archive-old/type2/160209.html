Subject: Re: [T2] Reversing exhaust manifolds and bending some exhaust
  pipe

Question: If you build the &quot;headers&quot; from the heads to the &quot;Y&quot; from 1.5&quot;,
then build the &quot;Y&quot; from each side in 1.75&quot; which would eventually connect to
a 4-2-1 system, why couldn't you split a length of 3&quot; (used on diesels), and
wrap it around your 'header pieces, closing them off and adding a 2&quot; inlet
and outlet?  Sure, there would be no fins inside, but airflow acrosss the
pipes themselves would transfer some heat.  Weld on sheet metal fins to get
more heat transfer.  Home built heater boxes?

We have actually thought of trying this on a friends Westy.  Serious exhaust
leaks which seem to be robbing a LOT of power.  It is an automatic, but no
where near what his '82 4 speed van does on the streets.

&gt; Hi Courtney,
&gt;
&gt; I considered that, but the first muffler guy I talked to came up with
&gt; the Harley pipes and the conversation stopped then and there.
&gt;
&gt; If I was gonna Y the system I would design the system bring the
&gt; exhaust forward, then connect the pipes up front and bring the
&gt; exhaust out just behind the driver's rear wheel. Running the muffler
&gt; in that location would keep it in the slipstream and there would be
&gt; less heat radiated towards the engine air intake.
