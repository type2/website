&gt;UPN has cancelled the TV show 'The Lone Gunmen'....
&gt;I wonder what will happen to the panel bus?

If you look very closely it is not a panel but rather a passenger bus 
with metal plates screwed over the window glass. Oh well, it was 
still cool to have a Transporter featured in a major network TV show.

If the are any TV producers out there I would like to suggest a 
replacement show which features buses.

Here's the  pitch.

A 30ish fellow, wife and two you children, and there two buses. 
Hilarious antics ensue as they try to pay the bills, keep the buses 
running and prevent those around them from being consumed by 
mediocrity.

Setting :a small North Carolina Town

Soundtrack would mostly be Minutemen from &quot;Double Nickels on the Dime &quot;

Theme:everything is better with 30 weight on it!

The show will never jump the shark
Chris
