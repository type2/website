Subject: spreading the word

I went to a first year event up in N Seattle this
weekend.. saw some old friends which is always good.
Sitting at my bus in the parking lot with some late
bay stuff for sale I had a number of conversations
with Volks. Aside from the people I saw who I have
known
for a while... these people had never heard of
type2_dot_com.
I get tired of verbal instructions on how to find this
group at shows.. was wondering if it would be possible
to make up a printable .doc file. lay out a number
of business card size handouts so one 8 1/2 x 11 sheet
would have around 20 cards each... have a link
up on the type2 site where folks can down load the
file.
print it out before a show and take some along in the
glove compartment...

Just an idea
