Subject: Antenna replacement

Our 1978 bus has a broken antenna and a broken antenna cable.  The 
antenna has a black base that seems to be mounted with two studs which I 
can not see.  It would be a simple matter to replace the antenna poll 
since is attached to the base with one screw, but this type of antenna 
seems to be discontinued.  bus depot sent a replacement antenna but it 
is of a different type and I can not see how one can possibly replace 
the base with a new type since it is blindly attached to the sill and I 
can't see how it is possible to get inside the sill to the back of the 
mount.  Also there is the antenna cable that is worn through under the 
dash.  input?

Jon
