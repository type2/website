Subject: Fridge problem

Hello everyone,
my name is Stefan and I am new to this list. I am german but now live in
Leicester, England. I own a 1989 multivan, 1.6TD and a 1975 Westfalia Type2.

I have a problem with the fridge in my Westy. It is the Electrolux 3way
fridge that was often fitted to this interior (Helsinki).
I have prepared some pictures and describe the problem on the following
website:
http://www.cpnet.co_dot_uk/stefan/vw/fridge/

Does anyone know what sort of regulator I should on the gasbottle to use
with this fridge? Which pressure does the fridge need to run?
Has anyone got a manual from that fridge or know where I can find one
online? I have already contacted Electrolux but they couldn't help...

thanks a lot,
Stefan
