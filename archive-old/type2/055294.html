Subject: VW Euro - Upcoming event 

Hello Volks,

Last month I wrote about the upcoming VW Euro (15-17 september in Holland,
that's Europe).

I promised to send a nice poster to contacts of VW clubs and to any other
person who could convince me they really needed one. It took a while but
this week I have sent them out.

For those who did not get one, you can print your own by going to
http://www.vweuro_dot_com and click the poster hyperlink.

Since we still have many posters left, I will be giving away some more. The
deal is as follows:

1.	First, go to  http://www.vweuro_dot_com and read what VW Euro is about.

2.	Then contact the webmaster of your local V-Dub club, editor
	of a VW related magazine, newspaper, whatever. Convince them
	that they have to mention VW Euro on their website, magazine,
	newspaper etc. We want a broad coverage. Let everyone know that
	VW Euro is the place to be on the third weekend in September.

3.	If you get something published let me know and give me some proof.
	I need a URL, photocopy or whatever is relevant. I will send you a
	20 x 30 inch poster printed on heavy semi-gloss paper.

Of course this applies mainly to Europeans but if you happen to be from
overseas (excluding the British, I consider them to be 'locals') and you
have nothing to do in that weekend and happen to be able to hop on a plane
and fly to Amsterdam we will give you the VIP treatment (as a matter of fact
we consider all our visitors to be Very Important so I'm not sure you'll
know the difference).
