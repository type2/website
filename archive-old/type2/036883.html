Subject: My first trip to Pomona

This type of thing is cool on Fridays, right?

I'm making my first of what I can only assume will be several trips to
Pomona this weekend, to look for stuff for my new 1970 bus (thanks again
all for the help so far!). So, I was wondering if the &quot;veterans&quot; out
there could give me some advice on what to be looking for and what to be
watching out for. I'll have a list by Saturday evening, and plan on
getting there early on Sunday.

Thanks!
