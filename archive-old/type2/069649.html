Subject: advice needed on state inspection

Folks, 
I'm in the process of selling my 79 bus, and want to get as much money
as I can for it.  In order to do this, I want to sell it state 
inspected.  Here are the results of what I need to pass inspection:
- -new drag link
- -alignment
- -body repair

Here's where the advice is needed: anyone know if IN FACT holes in the
body will fail a vehicle for inspection?  This bus has 5 holes, all
the size of a lemon.  The inspection station says &quot;holes must be 
smaller
than a dime&quot;.  Anyone know if in fact this is true?  I don't believe it,
cause it's non structural rust completely!  They said bondo in these areas
along with paint would pass.... 

Secondly, the drag link is &quot;worn&quot; according to inspector.  &quot;There is
play in the steering, which automatically fails vehicle&quot;
The new drag link(he called it a pitman arm) needs to be replaced.
they'll do the replacement and alignment for $100....is this a huge
ripoff??  It sounds like I don't have a choice...

Other than that, the bus is fine.  He even offered to buy it...
Thanks for any advice!
