&gt; &gt; Direct experience with Split fire plugs. Lotus turbo comes in running poor.
&gt; &gt; Pull plugs= split fires with less than 1000 miles on them had cracked
&gt; &gt; insulators. Stock plugs fixed all problems.
&gt;
&gt; The only engine I ever saw Splitfires work well in was a 200-horse Johnson
&gt; V6 outboard on my night shift supervisor's bass boat. He was using Champion
&gt; standard spark plugs because &quot;the manual&quot; said to use Champions, and the
&gt; manual didn't say &quot;Champion Platinum spark plugs.&quot; Anyone want to wager that
&gt; Johnson's CDI system needs platinum plugs to work right?

Champion plugs don't have that good a rep.  Poor quality control on the
threads wreaks havoc with aluminum heads.
