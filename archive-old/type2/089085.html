&gt; Ok, my four year old daughter left a lollipop on the front passenger
&gt; seat of my 78 bus and it melted into the cloth upholstery.  True, it is
&gt; my fault; I should not have given her the lolli, but these seats are new
&gt; to me, given to me at Everybus 2002 by some nice guy whose name I
&gt; forget, and I want to get this junk off my seat!  Any suggestions?

&gt;Beth and Prudence the 78 Baywindow.

Let her just lick it off the seat 8^)
The last we heard , your bus was about to be towed for a FI no-start.
What happened ?
