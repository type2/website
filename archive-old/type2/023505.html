Greetings to the many who responded about the Brazilian Devon article.  To
make a long story short, the sucker just wouldn't scan very well, plus it was
a HUGE file that would take forever to send to so many people.  To those who
MUST have  the whole thing, send me a SASE and I'll make you copies of my
copy.

 For the time being, here's the text:

THE NOISE FROM BRAZIL---Contrary to popular rumour, the VW Camper Van never
did actually die.  It was forced into exile, first in Mexico and later in
Brazil, and now, like so many other reminders of the age of tastelessness,
it's back in vogue.  Worse, you can buy it new in the UK.

     It's not surprising that the hippies went on endlessly about peace.
Spend an hour in the favoured transport of the flower-power generation and you
too will be chanting the mantra of, well, er, peace and quiet.  But, like
flared trousers, the ubiquitous and thrumming VW Type 2---known universally as
the Camper Van---is back, brand new and on sale in Britain.
     I thought the Type 2 had died in the 1970's, rock-star style.  Found nose
down in a swimming pool, perhaps, or choked on its own emissions.  In fact, it
had retired to South America to be churned out by VW Mexico alongside the
original Beetle.  Mexicans, it turns out, are an aurally sensitive bunch and
threw out the Type 2's demented flat-four in favour of a soothing water-cooled
unit.  Sadly, this meant screwing a massive radiator ont the VW's elegant
nose.
     Everything's back to normal now.  After the arrival of the new Beetle in
Mexico, Type 2 production was shunted to Volkswagen Brasilia, and the faithful
flat-four---in injected 1.6-litre catalysed form---was plumbed back in, so the
only thing worn on the nose now is the optional spare-wheel carrier.
     It's now available in Britain too---imported directly from the factory by
Beetles UK of Rangeworthy, near Bristol, alongside &quot;classic Beetles&quot;, which
can be converted to right-hand drive, and left-hook new Beetles.  Beetles UK
is part of the SMC group, an engineering consultancy founded 90 years ago and
noted for its &quot;6X6&quot;---a six-wheeler conversion for the Land Rover and other
off-roaders.  SMC's expertise also runs to armour-plating:  It has built
bullet-proof motors for Rueters and the New York Times.
     Pity it doesn't know much about sound proofing, but then there's not much
that would silence this motor, which sits inside the cabin in a metal box.
Even the foam'n'formica of the Devon &quot;Moonraker&quot; camper conversion (Type 2's
arrive from Brazil as plain windowless vans with a single sliding door) can't
quell the cacophony caused by the unleashing of 64-bhp.
     Stoking the Type 2 along Wiltshire county lanes requires plenty of
thought and much waving of the four-speed, leather-topped shifter.  Suffice it
to say the gate on the gearshift is of the old and rickety variety.  Steering
accurately around tight bends requires a recalibration of your brain's long-
held geometric prejudices too, a consequence of your position in front of the
front wheels and behind a horizontal steering wheel that sits closer than a
lap dancer.  The brake and clutch pedals sprout from the floor like spring-
loaded mushrooms and the umbrella-like handbrake makes no attempt to hide its
Edwardian crudity.
     Of most concern, however, were my rapidly chilling feet.  Close
examination of the basic dash revealed a slider to open the air vents and an
ominous blank where the heater control should be.  &quot;I know this sounds funny&quot;,
says Jason Jones of Beetles UK, &quot;but they don't have heaters as standard.  You
fit a separate furnace heater with thermostat for around $675 (pounds).  You
can have heat without the engine running.&quot;
     Ah, to enjoy heated feet in glorious silence, plus enough room---in this
$15,500 (pounds) Moonraker---to stretch out for a kip or even cook a bacon
sarnie on the built-in stove.  Me, I'd rather have one as a bolthole, parked
on bricks at the end of  the garden.  It could double as a kind of post-modern
Stonehenge.  ---HILTON HOLLOWAY
