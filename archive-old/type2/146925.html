Subject: Re: [T2] Accelerator Pedal Advice

Really depends on how rusty it is in there.  Hopefully the hinge didn't 
break off the floor.  From underneath, pull off the pan and undo the 
connection to the cable (easy enough).  There is one screw on there that 
takes out the play in the pedal.  Then back on top just push out the pin 
from the hinge to get the pedal out (I think that's how you do it).  I 
did it a while ago when mine was all gummed up.  There is a spring in 
there so you might want to watch that that doesn't pop out at ya.  I 
pulled it apart, cleaned it all nice, greased it, and put it all back 
together.  Works great now!

&gt; there any tips on how to make this go smoothly, or is it a pretty
&gt; straight forward swap?
