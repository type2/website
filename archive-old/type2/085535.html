Subject: Re: [T2] Finding a VDO dipstick sensor (was Overheating/Pulley)

I purchased an electronic cooking thermometer from Target for $15.  It has a
stainless steel probe and braided wire.  I had to bend it straight to get it
to slide all the way in.  It has an alarm that I have set to 225F.  Seems
pretty accurate and the price cannot be beat.  Right now I just have it
sitting in the cargo area.  Someday, I will run a wire to the front.  I have
my kids check the temp for me.  Having the alarm is nice.  I am not sure
what that will do the the accuracy, it the probe is a thermocouple, I will
have to get thermocouple extension wire.

&gt; 
&gt;&gt;&gt; I just want to point out (again) that in a type 4 engine, the
&gt;&gt;&gt; VDO dipstick 
&gt;&gt;&gt; sender will give you an identical reading to a properly
&gt;&gt;&gt; installed sump 
&gt;&gt;&gt; sender. 
&gt; 
&gt; Off the topic just a little, but who is a good supplier for these?
&gt;
