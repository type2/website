hi there volkies, i have just come back from a 60 mile belt to the florida
everglades and back in my 72 westy, 2.0, weber, 009.  just put in new gauges
and found this out. it seems to run at about 220 psi (filler plug sender) at
60 mph or below regardless of weather. however when taking it up to 65-70 the
temp goes up to 230/235, 3500-4000 rpm and 40-50 psi oil pressure. after my
running at this speed for 30 minutes or so when i stop and idle the oil light
goes on and gauge drops to 10 psi. i just put this motor back in and the oil
pump is a good condition heavy duty melling (i think). so im thinking maybe
the sender is a little off. please think and tell me what you guys with gauges
are running at. after one day with my gauges i never want to drive far without
them. clueless is not best...........

marty :)
