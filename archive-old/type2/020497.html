 &gt; I have heard that the original 1968 VW Westy poptop was smooth.
 &gt; After several months of production the top was redesigned with the
 &gt; ribbing to add strength as well as reduce resonant shaking at
 &gt; highway speeds.

My 68 Westy had the smooth top - you can barely make it out in this pic: 
http://www.supernet_dot_net/~jclark/vw/my_images/9_68_1.jpg.  You can see 
that the reinforced area around the hinge mounts is not present.

I had always wondered when &amp; why that change occurred!  But as far as I 
recall, that top was pretty strong, and it had the heavier supports.  I 
wonder if the change was so they could get away with using thinner tops, 
and thus cut down costs?

Of course, my 71's top resonates along the lower rear edges at highway 
speeds - so much for the improvement.  I guess age has caused it to 
relax a bit so that even with a new seal the edges don't _quite_ contact 
the roof.  Sorta a bernoulli effect.

My temp fix is to put a spring clamp on the gutter at each side, with 
additional stuff on it to push the edge against the metal roof.  Ugly 
but functional - I just have to remember to take them off before 
raising/lowering the top.  Ask me how I know that.
