Subject: Hitch for sale

I had an hitch made for my '70 then used it on my '71.  I can no longer use 
it with my new muffler set up.  It pulled The Love Bug (900 lb) travel 
trailer with no problems.  It has a receiver end and bolts directly to the 
frame by the rear bumper mounts.  The holes are already threaded in the 
frame.  If interested I can bring to EveryBus.  Asking $200  can take pics 
if needed.

Joy Thru Air,
