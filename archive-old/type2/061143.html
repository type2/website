Subject: Re:Starter Problem

Rick-
   I've had the same types of problems with my buses. One had an
intermittent starting problem and I tried cleaning connections to the
starter and had limited success as you have. One time I rigged a wire from
the solenoid to the battery (+)in order to be able to get the solenoid to
click and turn the starter, after doing this it would start fine with the
key. I used to accomplish this by shorting out the connection at the
starter with a ratchet handle, with the wire I wouldn't need to crawl under
the bus to do it. On the first try of this new setup I killed the entire
electrical system. I quickly unhooked my brilliant invention and started
checking fuses etc. In my bus the radio works when the key is off and as I
was wondering what to do next it slowly came back on. Turning the key
killed it again and it reminded me of a problem I had with another car. The
battery ground cable and/or the connection to the frame had become a
semiconductor from corrosion, it  conducts enough electricity for lights
and the radio but when you put a load on it, it cuts out completely and
then comes back after a few minutes. I relocated the ground cable to one of
the bolts on the engine mount cross member and have not had any problem
since. (as I write this I realize my invention is still disconnected and
hanging under the bus).
   My other bus had an elaborate solenoid switch (the Ford part sometimes
used to fix the `hot start' problem). The engine was blown and the PO said
it needed this in order to start (when it ran). When I got another motor in
it I could not figure out his wireing, so I took the whole thing out and
connected it as stock. I connected the battery ground cable to a bolt on
the fan housing (type IV) and havn't had any problem with it starting. I
intended to put the relay switch back in as recommended by people on the
list but once the problem stoped I forgot about it.
    Here in the northeast the road salt gets into everything and I know
damp salt conducts electricity better than dry salt so these problems seem
to come and go with the weather. While you're at it check the ground strap
at the front of the transmission to the frame, it's another weak spot.
    By the way, once you're educated, you aren't a Hillbilly anymore.
