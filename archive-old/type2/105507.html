Subject: First Ride

Took Giacomo out for a spin around the neighborhood tonight.  I have to
switch from the Sentra to him this week; as the S is about shot, and now up
for sale (trying to get enough to replace the front seats in G).

The clutch seems okay, but worn.  The engine runs rough at times, but I
wasn't able to get him over 15 mph in the neighborhood because of the kids
(dirt roads).  I'm hoping that a run at 35 mph might clean up the cylinders
a bit.  He also needs new air cleaner, and an oil change would probably not
hurt.

Using the stick is a little weird after the tight movement of the S's stick.
I had to think and play a bit to remember where reverse was (the shift knob
is missing, and yes, I'm sculpting a custom one; sort of a Star Wars kinda
throttle thing).  I could remember having to push down, but not where the
gear was!

Is the stick supposed to lay up against the side of your right leg?  Or is
my bus just letting me know that he's fond of his new owner?

Needs shocks, or I'm just not use to the ride, yet.  The steering is a bit
loose, I don't like the few degrees of play.

Everything electrical seems to work, including the high beam switch, but the
turn signal function is shot.  I'm hoping that I can rebuild it.

Tomorrow, we try a 3 mile round trip to the store...
