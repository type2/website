Here's another vote for bus based time distortion.

I'm NOT a good driver in traffic, as I stress out all the time about getting
where I'm supposed to be, but when I'm in the bus, it just doesn't matter
that much.

Large part of the reason I'm trying to build the DC to replace the late
model &quot;work&quot; car, driver stress therapy! ;^)

&gt; Ok, time for a Friday that I've been wanting to ask...
&gt;
&gt; I haven't owned my bus for long, about four months, but I've noticed a
&gt; strange phenomenon while driving it. Time seems to slow down, almost come
to
&gt; a halt, while I'm in my bus. Used to be, my drive to work was a near-panic
&gt; episode, constantly watching the clock on the dash, speeding up to make
that
&gt; yellow light, ripping away from the lights, etc. I used to drive a little
&gt; sports car and it only made things worse. But I got rid of it and bought
my
&gt; bus and things have definitely changed! There is no clock to watch and
&gt; ripping away from stoplights is definitely out of the question. But, for
&gt; some reason, it doesn't seem to matter. I leave when I'm going to leave
and
&gt; don't think about the time again until I get out of the bus at work. No,
&gt; there are no 'substances' involved and I do tend to be a little hyper,
most
&gt; of the time. Something about putting down the road in this over-grown
&gt; lawnmower makes the commute much nicer.
&gt;
&gt; Is this only happening in my bus? Do I need to call &quot;Unsolved Mysteries?&quot;
&gt; Just thought I'd ask. =^)
