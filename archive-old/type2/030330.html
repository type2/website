&gt; I have a '71 camper without the optional headrests for the front seats and am

&gt; resorting to welding?  

Well, for the drivers seat, there are all sorts of options.  The seat
rails will accept all bus and V'gon seats, so you can go all sorts of
directions there.  The passenger seat is another matter.  it uses a clip
in system that was only '68-'73, so you will either need to weld or get
the headrests (optional from ?? -72, standard in '73).  I believe you may
be able to insert the later headrests.  It would look a bit funny, but for
safety, I would not care much about looks.  

If you (or anyone else who reads this) are (a) close to Washington DC and
(b) want a set of 68-73 seat frames tht have the tubes for the headrests,
altho not the headrests, I have a set of frames that I am close to putting
in the trash.  Pick 'em up and they are yours! They have no rust, they
have the tubes for headrests, they have *NO* upholstery or foam, and will
nead re-covering.
