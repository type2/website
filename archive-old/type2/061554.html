Subject: Sermons CD-ROM--Last chance before Xmas!

Just a quick reminder that in the world of mail order, this weekend IS
Christmas. Orders placed this weekend are the last ones that have a good
chance of being in your hands in time for the holiday.

We got a little back-ordered last week but Bus Depot has plenty of stock on
hand now. The Sermons of Bob Hoover CD-ROM makes a great holiday gift for
your VW friends, or especially for yourself.
