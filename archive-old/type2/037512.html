Subject: WTB diesel Vanagon

Wanted to ask this on Friday...but list down and all...

I'm looking for a Vanagon Westie diesel for a daily driver...or if
someone has an 83.5 or newer with a blown engine, that would do as
well...

Don't ask...it's a long story...

I know I'm fishing on this list being aircooled and all, but I have to
ask...

Den.
