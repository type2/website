Gentlepersons-
                       Years back, I added a three speed blower from a 
'merican car to my '71
Bus. Mounted it in the spare tire well and ran alum. tubing to the heat 
exchanger inlets.
I capped off the engine fan at the doghouse. The three speed circulated the 
air inside the Bus, instead of continuously heating outside air. After a few 
minutes (5-10), the
Bus got quite warm:-)
                      I'm thinking about the same sort of thing for a '79 2L. 
Any thoughts about
this? Would/could the extra fan conflict with the engine fan. I'll probably 
put flapper valves in the air lines to prevent blow-back.
