Subject: Oil Pressure Sender - CORRECTION!!!

I posted yesterday that my new pressure sender and gauge was hooked up
so the 'G' on the sender went to the dummy light and the 'WK' went to
the gauge.  This was WRONG!!

Thanks to Sean Bartnik who politely suggested I double check my
connections since what I posted was contrary to his knowledge.  He was
correct.  I did indeed connect the 'G' to the Gauge and the 'WK' to the
Warning (K)light and that is the correct way.

Sorry for any confusion I may have caused!!!!  (And thanks to Sean for
catching my blatant mistake.)
