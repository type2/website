&gt; Also brought the CO detector
&gt; from the house and set it up near where I was working... never know when
&gt; you may have an exhaust leak.
&gt;

You seem to have covered all the bases but please remember:
those commercial CO detectors are not calibrated instruments designed for
this purpose (check the instructions, you'll see that there are enough
disclaimers to make you wonder if it does anything at all). Also remember
that there is a good chance that you could aphixiate (or be incapacitated)
from CO2 (or CO or lack of O2) long before the alarm goes off. I really
think that there is no safe way for one shade tree mechanic to run an engine
in an enclosed space. A calibrated CO and O2 detector connected to an alarm
located outside the enclosure is a step in the right direction. There should
be breathing apparatus available to trained personnel monitoring that alarm
(it seems like I took all the fun out of it :) )

In short, quit while you're ahead (and alive) and wait for better weather.

Hope this helps,
