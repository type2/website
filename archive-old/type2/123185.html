except for the prostitute part sounds an awefull lot like the situation in

I would call the sheriff.  if you want me to call also forward the phone
number as I have mislaid it 

sure would like to give her family some closure

&gt; As many of you will remember, Kristen Ann Laurite was travelling alone across
&gt; the United States in her 1971 bus and was murdered at a rest area on I-40 in
&gt; Arkansas in August of 2000.  That murder is still unsolved but I saw an
&gt; article on the CNN web site today that sparked my interest...
&gt; http://www.cnn_dot_com/2004/US/02/27/possible.serial.killer/index.html
&gt; 
&gt; As I read it, I was reminded of the murder of Kristen Laurite, which remains
&gt; unsolved.  Altho there are definite differences, there are also similarities.
