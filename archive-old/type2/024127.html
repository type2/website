Hi All,

I am sending this out on behalf of my Brother who is trying to work the
kinks out of his new 1776.  It is in a 71' standard and he is having temp
issues.  The motor has about 200 miles on it and is running between 425 and
450 down the road (as per the new VDO cylinder head temp gauge, 55-60 mph). 
As for the particulars, 1776 w/ new 009 &amp; standard blue streak points, 34
pict3, bosch blue coil, extractor exhaust and a very mild cam.  

Anyone familiar with jetting/timing this configuration please drop me a line
as its kind of mission critical that this gets ironed out... He has a new
job waiting in the bay area &amp; he needs to drive this there.

Thanks in advance,
Brian Tipsword
Salem, Or
