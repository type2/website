Subject: distributor replacement

My 1974 1800cc with dual Kadrons has a 009 distributor, I would like to 
replace it with a better one. Would the original dist. work well with the 
Kadrons? and how would I get the vacuum for it to run correctly (where to I 
tap into)? Or is there a better dist. out there? 050?

Thanks,
Nathan
