&gt; Crutchfield has the Kenwood deck that is 'shaft mounted'. Kenwood
&gt; KRC-2007.
&gt; They work fine, no cutting necessary. Has most of the bells and whistles
&gt; needed.
&gt; Reasonably priced as well. Only $99.95.
&gt; Call Crutchfield at 800-955-6000 or see their website at
&gt; www.crutchfield_dot_com

Be aware, however, that not all of the radios listed as fitting the Bus on
the Crutchfield site will actually do so without modification.  As has been
noted before, the Bus dash opening is not quite a DIN sized opening, it's a
bit smaller.  Crutchfield (which is an outstanding operation, BTW) rates the
difficulty of installing various radios based on whether you have to modify
the dash or not.  Some of the radios they list are rated as EZ, which is
supposed to mean no mods necessary but in fact they are standard DIN sized
radios and will not fit without enlarging the dash hole a bit.  Just
something to keep in mind while you are shopping.

OTOH, Crutchfield's web site is neat because you can tell it to display only
the radios that will fit your vehicle, and then you can order online.
Crutchfield ships 2-day UPS by default (I think it was $6 something on the
order I just got from them today) so you have it quickly, and they provide
wiring harness adapter kits so you can just plug the radio's harness into
the car's harness and not have to figure out what wires do what (tho this
isn't relevant in a VW Bus, but is great in newer cars).  I just bought a
Kenwood in-dash CD receiver from them for my Mercedes, ripped out the dying
Alpine CD receiver and bizarrely-wired Sony external amp that the previous
idiots had buried behind the carpet in the passenger-side footwell (no
wonder my wiring didn't match up with the wiring diagrams -- I had no
previous knowledge of that amp before today) -- ripped all that out,
installed the Kenwood (super simple, the Mercedes dash really is a DIN sized
hole, and it is a PERFECT fit) and now I got nice tunes again :-) -- I
ordered the receiver from Crutchfield's site on Friday afternoon and
received it today.  Mercedes also keeps it interesting by having a
center-console mounted fader that you have to run the speakers through, but
that's a story for another list.  Crutchfield also included a nice harness
to link up with the factory harness, but that did me no good as it had been
hacked previously.  Oh well :-)

But as you can see, I like Crutchfield :-)
