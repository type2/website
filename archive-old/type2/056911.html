Subject: Parting Out '79 Westy (U-Pull-It)
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

I have a fairly complete beige '79 Deluxe Westy that needs to get off my
lot, due to the fact that the inspection ran out last month and local
ordinance prohibits storage of uninspected vehicles.  The following prices
are YOU-PULL-IT prices (Philadelphia area).  I'd rather not ship, and
certainly will not ship big items (interior, engine, trans, etc.).  You
remove at your risk, with your tools.  This bus was on the road until just a
few months ago, but a multitude of dents plus low compression preclude it
from worthwhile restoration in my opinion. Customer drove it in and traded
it toward a nicer one.

Engine (2 liter, low compression but runs, complete except for some F.I.
parts) $100
Transmission, Automatic $150
Complete Camper Interior (sofabed, cabinets, sink, stove, fridge, trim,
AC/DC control panel, AC adaptor, etc. No tables, upper bunk mattress covers,
or trash bin. Will fit '68-79)  $350
Propane Tank (will not sell until interior is sold, in case interior buyer
wants it) $80
Louvered Windows $25/pr
Poptop and Luggage Rack (canvas bad) $75
Doors (rear, sliding, front, engine, typical rust) $15 ea/$50 all
Other parts - come by and make an offer!
