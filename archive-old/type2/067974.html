Subject: Re: front tire carrier

&gt;Hey, Rick, where did you get your carrier, and is it a 3 hole mount, that
&gt;installs in the holes that are there from the VW emblem, or is it a 6 hole
&gt;mount that you had to drill holes for ?  

Dave:

I dunno.  The carrier was on the bus when I bought it, but it's 
attached with six screws, three along each straight side.
The one on the hood of my Thing came from JC Whipme, I
think--it attached similarly to the one on the bus, but is of a
different construction.

I, personally, wouldn't worry about the mounting system.  Once
you have the tire up front where it belongs, there's really no reason
to remove it.  hah! just listen to him!  The &quot;uses 3 existing holes&quot; 
type sounds neat (so as not to mess up front of bus), but I think
I'd rather have a few more screws holding it on, and maybe a strip
of 1/8&quot; steel on the inside of the cab for rigidity.

good luck!
