Subject: [T2] AFM Adjustment?? (Running again! :-)

Hello all,

I'd like to first thank everyone who sent me suggestions/advice a few
weeks ago when I was troubleshooting my 77 Transporter FI.  I thought I
had a problem with the FI system but my problem ended up being a bad
electronic ignition (MagFire) and a dying coil. I installed the
Pertronix Ignitor electronic ignition with the Pertronix matching high
performance coil and it fired right up!!

My problem is that I did something very stupid back when I was trying to
figure out what the problem was. (Oops)  Someone told me that the spring
in the AFM sometimes goes bad and people adjust the rich/lean screw (for
lack of correct terminology) all the way down to deal with this problem.
Eventually the spring gets so bad that the adjustment will no longer
take care of the problem and other measures have to be taken. (or so I
was told)

Like a fool, I messed around with the screw and now I have no idea what
the original or ideal position is. Is there any way I can figure this
out without going to a shop that has an exhaust gas analyzer??

Thanks in advance for any advice you can provide.

Jason
