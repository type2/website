Subject: RE: [T2] fuel filler neck, 211 201 119  Needed ASAP. 

&gt; Anybody know where I can get one of these in just a couple 
&gt; days or less? The closer to the east coast the better.


We have 'em in stock for $24.95. If you order tomorrow we can overnight
it to you and you'll have it on Thursday. Shipping shouldn't be too bad
since we're on the east coast and it's lightweight. Best is to call in
your order, if you need overnight delivery. We open at 11 eastern time.
