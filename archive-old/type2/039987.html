&gt; query:Anybody got a story of a late model bus b-joint coming apart?

George Lyle: Not too likely, seeing as how the weight of the bus keeps
them together.

So you are saying that if you hit a hole where the wheel drops suddenly,
THEN you couold separate a loose ball joint?  Are there any beforehand
clues, like rattling on slight washborded roads?
