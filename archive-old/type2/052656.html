Subject: [T2] trans builder needed and reputation

I am going to start building a (custom) freeway flyer performance 
transmission and need a &quot;good guy&quot; firm that the list recommends.

TRANSFORM, MOFOCO, Strickly Foriegn, John Maher, Bergmann, Audirac, Berg, 
ewtc.... or any other PROFESSIONAL (long time in business... with a good 
rep) that can do this.

I lost some money a while back with one of our buddies on the list that took 
a deposit from me, some oil, and up and hauled butt (family problems rumour 
has it). Anyone heard from him lately ?

The firm must be out in CA, as I will have it matched up to an engine 
currently being built, and then it will all be shipped to me.

*** I would also like to hear if anyone has had a custom tranny built (for 
two motors 2221cc, and a 1914cc... will be swapping them in and out) and 
things that have worked out for them. HD parts, best quality this or that, 
make sure you have this... do that etc.

Mykl and
Rusty (71 Westfalia)
and looking for early
60's crewcab
