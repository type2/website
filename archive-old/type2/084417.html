Subject: What I Learned Today..........And........

Hiya All,

Today I learned that shop manuals can be (and I'm being generous here) 
misleading.  You should know, right off the top, that I have collected  quite 
a few manuals which pertain to my 1970 Bus.  I had always thought that I 
could spare myself some grief by reading three or four differing points of 
view before undertaking a new (to me) project.

But when I went to pull out my front vent wings and frames, the manuals 
really let me down.  I think that may be due, in part, to the fact that most 
of the manuals available out there today are distillations of the original VW 
shop manuals.  Heck, the VW Transporter Service Manual (1968-1970) contained 
the same phrasing and pictures as the Bentley.  And both were vague and 
misleading.  Luckily, Karl and Steve came through with the &quot;real goods&quot; and I 
did get the job done today.

All of which makes me think............is there anybody out there who would 
be interested in working on authoring a new Bus Shop Manual?  I'm not 
particularly thinking of a profit-making enterprise here.  It simply seems to 
me that many of the Bus related tasks we eventually get around to can be 
described much better than the material we now have.  It might also be a way 
of helping to &quot;pay back&quot; a lot of the folks who have dispensed their 
knowledge and given of their time.

Well, just a thought.  But if this sounds interesting, drop me a P-Mail.

Mike
