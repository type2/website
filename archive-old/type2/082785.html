&gt; &gt; 8) Tensleep Pass (in WY) over the Bighorns is a spectacular drive.
&gt;
&gt; I want to do this one someday very badly.  Again, it has an excellent rep.

Very nice.  Good road.  Take your time!  Buffalo has a very nice museum.
&gt;
&gt; &gt; 10) The Grand Tetons are really beautiful.
&gt;
&gt; The Grand Tetons are, however, not for people in VW buses :-)  At the very
&gt; least, do *not* be tempted by Rt. 22 coming out!  It is the *steepest*
&gt; road I have ever been on!!!  the SUVs were in 2nd!  I agree that it is
&gt; among the most beautiful places on earth, but it is also among the most
&gt; abrupt.  do it if you want, but an oil temp gauge should be required,
&gt; like chains in the passes in the winter.  No gauge, no go.

I always wonder about warnings like this.  I've never found a pass in the
western US that I couldn't climb in my bus with no problem.  Perhaps I was
in 3rd or 2nd, but that what the gears are for!  As long as you are not
operating at maximum power (WOT) continuously you won't have any problem
if your bus is in good shape.

&gt; &gt; 11) Wind Cave National Park has a small campground that costs about
&gt; &gt; $10 a night,and has a resident herd of bison. It's about 6 miles north
&gt; &gt; of Hot Springs, SD, which has a operational woolly mammoth dig that
&gt; &gt; was discovered during excavation of an apartment complex about 25
&gt; &gt; years ago: worth the visit. The caves at Wind Cave and Jewel Cave are
&gt; &gt; both worth visiting.

I've been to Hot Springs SD, and had a great time.  The Log Cabin motel is
good, and the local warm pool was worth the trip.  If the SoCal tort
lawyers ever saw that pool they would have a cow!  :)


&gt; Yup!  Same here.  At the same time, there is nothing to unite you and your
&gt; bus like changing out a dying clutch cable in the NFS campground above St.
&gt; George, Utah :-)

As long as you have a spare along!  :)
&gt;
&gt; Which brings up National Forest Service (NFS) campgrounds.... I love them
&gt; and rely on them!  they are marked in most atlases and are cheap and good.

I like them too.  Often you can find NF, state park, and BLM sites that
are comperable or better than the NPS sites and a lot less crowded.
Sometimes it seems that the NPS wants to run its parks like Disneyland!
