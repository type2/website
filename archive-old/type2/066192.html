mechanically impaired than those of us here on the right coast. For over 20 
years I've been told by machine shops in the New England area that 36 hp 
cases can't be linebored because there are no oversized bearings 
available...

go figure...

they just didn't want to reset the machine, lazy so and sos.     It is EASIER
to find oversized bearings for 36/25 hp that the standard ones.   The motor
in my 53 I took apart, had measured, cleaned and put together with new
bearings w/o having the case machined.   It was difficult to find those
standard bearings.    It has a set of cold weather mains in it.   Wierd, but
the first standard mains i found.
