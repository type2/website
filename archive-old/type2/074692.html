Subject: Help - ball joint replacement

Hi Folks,

I'm helping a buddy replace the ball joints on his '71 Westy, and we've run 
into a snag.  We're at the step where you pop the ball joint stud free from 
the steering nuckle, and we've tried and tried, but the damn thing still 
won't budge.  We've hit it with a hammer, tried prying it loose (he's 
replacing the torsion arms as well), and sworn and thrown tools, but it's 
still stuck.

We're going to try applying heat to it and hit it with a 3-pound sledge, but 
I'm still a little worried about the outcome.  Are we destroying the 
steering nuckle by hitting it when it's hot?  Is this standard procedure, or 
is there an alternative?  If it still doesn't pop loose, do we have to pull 
out the whole assembly as a unit?

Thanks in advance for any advice or sympathy...

Jason
