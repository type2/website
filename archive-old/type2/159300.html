BugFormance San Jose
31 South Capitol Ave
San Jose
408-926-8830

BugFormance Sunnyvale
944 West El Camino Real
Sunnyvale
408-245-9351

I've never had anything in for repair to either BugFormance, but I was
NOT impressed with my many visits to the Sunnyvale location.  I've been
told the SJ repair shop was good, tho'...  But our brother is up the
peninsula...  I recommended Kohlweiss in Redwood City for parts - they rock.
