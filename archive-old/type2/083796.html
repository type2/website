Subject: Re: [T2] california scrap vehicle notification info

We get the chatter from time to time about scrapping programs etc and it
is usually all negative.
I find this to be incredibly cool. Am I the only one that is surprised
that they care enough to go to any trouble? As usual Cali is first
hopefully this will happen elsewhere.
