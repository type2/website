&gt; &gt;Looking for any info on how to mount the transmission from my 74
bus into a

&gt; Leif,
&gt; 
&gt; Swap a 1968-70 bell housing onto the 1974 tranny, cut 3/8&quot; off the
input 
&gt; shaft, and swap the studs &amp; front mount from the 1970 tranny to the
nose 
&gt; cone of the 1974 tranny.

I did this recently and I kept the 76 bell housing but swapped the
input shafts. The newer trans has the &quot;ears&quot; on it but they do not hit
or interfer with anything. One thing to keep in mind is that the final
drive ratio may differ. I found that I cruise at a lower RPM but have
a little more trouble climbing hills. Good Luck
