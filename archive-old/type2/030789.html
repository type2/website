&gt;The last time I had a windshield replaced ( Safelite, Springfield, VA.)
&gt;was on a GMC van. It leaked so bad I kept a roll of paper towels on the
&gt;dash.

WOW.  I guess I should be installing windshields for a living.

Mine was installed with the assistance of my lovely wife and as of yet is
leak-free.  And it's been another &quot;Seattle-of-the-South&quot; week here in
Knoxvegas.

I cannot speak as highly of my doors, however.

Missing my calling,
