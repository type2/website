Subject: The lone gunman and rust protection

Now that it's Friday I can also mention that the Lone Gunman is back on
tonight. That means the bus still lives!!
Now the sighting &quot;rust protection&quot;. I saw a bus at a local spray in bed
liner place. It was covered with the black textured plastic stuff.  I am
going to take pictures of it tonight. I'll try and post a link later.
