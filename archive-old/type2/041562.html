don't have a converter but have found the source of the problem.

# 1,2,4 plugs were nice and clean #3 was wet and black, ah oh,  checked,
no compression at all, pulled valve cover, Exhaust valve cannot be
adjusted.  

no sounds or anything from engine, (have dropped valve before it is not
quiet)in fact engine is running quite smooth, idles a little rough but
only symptom was poor fuel mileage.  ?????? guess the head has to come
off, don't have a 2 liter head either will have to find one....

Thanks
