Subject: RE: [T2] Anybody Have These?

they do duct or direct the warm air coming off the hot cylinders to the rear
of the bus. Hence if you are working behind a hot running bus, you will feel
warm air blowing on your shins.

&gt; Just curious as to why they would be called warm air ducts? Could be a
&gt; vendor description.
