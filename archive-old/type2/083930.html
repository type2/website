&lt;&lt; The check list looks good I would advise you to loose the fix-a-flat. That
stuff is really bad. It also contains flammable material which I have
personally seen explode at a tire shop while getting new tire mounted.  &gt;&gt;

Any feedback on &quot;Slime&quot; pre-puncture sealant...A buddy of mine uses it
on his strictly farm-used pickup and swears by it. Just curious about
street use...
