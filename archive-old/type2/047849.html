&gt; Hi listees,
&gt;
&gt;  Next to the voltage
&gt; regulator plug (on the D+ end) is a single contact labeled +.  Should this be
&gt; connected to anything?

Is it just a +, or a B+,  The Vanagan Bentley indicates the voltage regulator is
built into the altenator.  Is this the case?

The wiring diagram shows a thin blue wire from the charging indicator lamp
attached to the D+ terminal and a thick red wire from the battery terminal on the
starter solinoid to the B+ terminal.

Hope this helps.

Mike D.
