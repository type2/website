Steve is great!  He gave me advice on a lock problem and turned me into a
do-it-yourself- rekeyer!

&gt; Hello List:
&gt;
&gt; I just wanted to post a little info concerning one of our fellow list
members, Steve Sandlin.  We hear from Steve from time to time concerning
lock and key issues for our busses, and I sent him a whole set of new locks
for my 71 Bus for him to key-alike.  His turn-around time is fantastic, and
he takes the time to communicate and follow-up like all service providers
should.  He has my highest recommendation, and hopefully all list members
will be able to do business with Steve in the future.
&gt;
&gt; Since most posts concerning vendors seem to be negative in nature, I think
it's important to also give praise when it's due.
