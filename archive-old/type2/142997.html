Subject: Re: [T2] Where would you buy them?

&quot;I would love to do away with the smog stuff. Does that cause any other
issues? I have asked in the past about how much can I remove without causing
problems, but I have received conflicting responses.&quot;

I think it depends. The ports in my heads have always been blocked off, and
the pulley for the pump has always been missing as well. I saved the pump
but don't have any other stuff.

Smog equipment as a definition includes the breather box (need) the vacuum
advance prevention switch doohickey (don't need), the charcoal canister
(don't need, but it's better than venting gasoline fumes either in the
engine compartment or into the atmosphere), and carburation, timing, etc.

This is all from my 73. Your bus may differ.
