&gt; &gt;Can anyone tell me where to find a 021-251-503A Crossover Pipe Late 1976

&gt; 
&gt; Yes...a junkyard, and nowhere else. They're discontinued. Your two options
&gt; are to buy an aftermarket extractor system (which doesn't require the part),
&gt; or switch to either a '72-74 or '79-83 system (best solution, solves the
&gt; problem for good, but requires replacement of the heat exchangers).

I have changed my exhaust system to the 72-74 style and have a pipe that
is in fair condition (if I can find it)

I suggest the changed Exhaust system the 75-78 is not well made and it is
hard to find parts.

but if you really want the pipe let me know and I will look for it
