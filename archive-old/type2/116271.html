Subject: Steering Wobble!

Hey guys... 
 
    I'm starting to drive my Bus more and more now, and more little problems
are surfacing due to the increased use.
 
When I drive over 45 miles an hour, one of the wheels in the front, maybe
one, maybe both... starts wobbling like crazy. The steering wheel really
REALLY gives me the feedback too.. 
 
What specifically on the suspension could cause this problem? I'm planning
on rebuilding the suspension in the near future (whatever that entails) but
I'm just curious if that's indicative of a specific problem.
 
 
Thanks!
