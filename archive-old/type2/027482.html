Hey y'all
I sold the BN4 from the Express, kept the firewall.  I managed to scarf a 
non-BN4 firewall from a bus destined for the crusher and installed it with 
the last engine pull.  I have a fdirewall already cut out for the real BN4 
setup.  How does $30 + shipping sound?  That's how much gas I use going to 
see my family on the weekend.  I'm not doing the E-bay thing (yet), listees, 
as always, get first dibs.

It might not even have made much difference to them if they'd known exactly 
how much power the President of the Galaxy actually wielded: none at all. 
Only six people in the Galaxy knew that the job of the Galactic President 
was not to wield power but to attract attention away from it.
