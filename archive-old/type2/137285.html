Subject: Re: [T2] Asian tools

With respect to you Anton, I would buy American and Canadian tools if I
could afford them. When I bought a Snap-On tire gauge for my motorcycle
about 10 years ago, it was ridiculously priced at 22 dollars. My Snap-On
Torque Wrench was a measly 249 dollars. That is insane pricing. When I went
and bought a set of Craftsman wrenches, I was shocked to see I had paid 89
dollars for a set of tools Made In Taiwan!! The exact same wrenches ( in
appearance, I'm not into metalurgy) was for sale at Canadian Tire for 29
dollars. I am not sure, but perhaps if prices were a little easier for us
middle class types we might be a little more faithful to non-foreign
manufacturers. Just a thought, but when you ain't Rockefeller price means a
lot.

Regards,

Courtney

Subject: [T2] Asian tools

 

Volks,

 

When I was in the auto industry (publishing/Professional Tool &amp;

Equipments News) I had friends who owned Schley Tools (SP Tools) in

Anaheim, CA and they absolutely DETESTED the Asian import/export guys

who would come to the ASIA/AAIW show and buy tools to clone as cheapo

knock-offs back in their homelands.

 

Drove them batty.

 

Of interest is that Paul and his brother started in the business doing

VW mods. (They now race Vipers, though). Maybe some of you know them as

well?

 

Good guys. I promised them I would NEVER buy an imported tool. With the

exception of my Beta Tools (a present from Beta) all of my tools are

Made in America.

 

Hm...maybe John Ratzenberger needs to do a show on the Schleys.

 

Anton
