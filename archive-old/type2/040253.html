I'll second the vote on a rod bearing!  My ghia is nearing the finish of a total overhaul even as we speak.  The symptoms were as you describe.  Oil light staying on a little too long in the mornings, plus a knock, knock when first starting out (and occasional flickering of oil light when idling at stoplights).  The car ran fine, compression decent, but we didn't want to risk wrecking its original engine, so chose to tear her down and go through her completely--don't panic, you could probably just deal with the rod bearings if all else looks decent...  Just as well, the oil pump was also nearing the end of its lifespan, so now we should be set for a good few years.
