Subject: Re: [T2] Limped Home

Thomas,

My 78 had sat for 8 years and started out sitting with a full tank of gas.

Look at picture #12 to see what came out of my gas tank.

Not saying that yours will be that bad, but the symptoms are almost 
exactally the same.  I could drive 3.5 miles and the bus would die.
Could restart sometimes and it would idle for a long time, but no power.

I could leave it for a couple of hours and it would drive home just fine.

One look at what came out of the tank will tell you that it was covering
and uncovering the line to the fuel pump.

Check your filter and replace first!...see if it gets any better.

You may not have the same stuff(rock hard gasoline) in your tank, it just
depends on what/how much was in it when it was parked and whether it
dried completely before you saved it.

Cheers, dave

&gt; Hey all..
&gt; I just got my 1978 Bus up and running. It had been sitting 
for over 3 years...I bought it about a week (or so) ago and 
the place I bought it is a VW garage...They know the 
air-cool...anyway, the engine had been rebuilt, 
and new alternator is in place...new oil...new sparks...
the whole nine yards...About the only problem it was 
showing was an odd oil leak around the left hand side 
valve cover...After taking it off, cleaning it, new gasket, 
then running the bus around a bit, adjusting the 
cover some more, the oil leak seems to be gone.  
&gt; So I drove it here and there, the speed an average 
of about 40 MPH...Then tonight I took it out to Miramar 
(about 20 miles from where I live in Miami) and cruised 
along at about 70...Seemed to be fine. Stopped and let 
my brother off at work. Engine purring. Turned the corner--
Stall. Got about 40 feet. Let it sit for a few minutes 
(thought it might be hot)...Turned over, and it would start, 
but then stall. Figured maybe the gas gauge is inaccurate, 
so pushed it to the Chevron right around the corner. 3.180 
gallons later, it was full. So I knew it was not out of gas. 
Jumped in and started, drove home about 3 miles, when it 
started to stall again. Long story short, I got home in third gear, 
limping...It would go up to 40, then sputter down to 30, then up to 
40...and so on. Barely made it home. When I did stop at lights, and 
sit, the engine would be fine. Then I would put it into first, 
and it would almost stall...thus why if I left it in third, 
I got home. Weird. I have had 11 VWs in all (4 Type 1, a Type 
3, two Type 2, A Ghia, and three Rabbits) and never had 
I run into this before...Any ideas? I am tired, it's late; maybe I'm missing the obvious...
