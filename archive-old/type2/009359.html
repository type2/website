&gt; &gt; 3. The wider tread of the 195- tire puts more stress on the steering
&gt; &gt; box when the wheels are turned with the bus stationary.  Steering
&gt; &gt; boxes are expensive to replace.  Contrary to the popular notion,
wide
&gt; &gt; tires do not offer more traction than narrow tires except under
&gt; &gt; conditions where the tires are subject to frictional heating such as
&gt; &gt; in a sports car.  Buses are about as far from a sports car as you
can
&gt; &gt; get!
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; I don't use wider tires for &quot;sports car&quot; handling, but for off road
&gt; in mud and sand they sure make a difference. And a camper is
definitely
&gt; a back road vehicle. The bigger tires are also load rated much
higher --
&gt; my 225's are rated at 1840 lbs per, which means they should last much
&gt; longer as well.

185R14s in load range D (more commonly available than load range C)
have a load rating of 1850 pounds, so there's not much difference
there.  I'm sure that the 185s run at higher pressure which is worse
for flotation and better for hydroplane-resistance and fuel economy.  

If you're planning to do a lot of off-roading (meaning _really_ off
the road!) then you might be better off with larger tires, but if you
stick to roads (even if some of them are dirt) the stock size is
better.  I've done a lot of travelling in the boonies on 185s and have
only been stuck once.  I doubt that bigger tires would have helped me
in that instance, as they didn't help the CJ5 that motored by and sank
in 30 yards further up the sandwash!  Taller tires are definitely
better in rocks, where they prevent rim pinches in the sidewalls.
 
I would get stuck more often if I tried to get further into the back
country in my bus, but that's what I have dirt bikes for!

&gt; I'd be very surprised if the wider tires even slightly affected the
&gt; life of the steering box, and if so, it'd be so little that I'm sure I
&gt; can afford it as the price to pay for not getting stuck nearly as
often.

That's a tradeoff you are willing to take, but I don't think that it
is sound advice for the majority of bus owners who aren't avid
off-roaders.  I know from experince that replacing a steering box is
no picnic, and the replacements aren't cheap.  The 195 tires result in
noticibly increased steering effort at a standstill.  I'm sure that
the 205s would be higher still since the wider tread and larger
contact patch increase the moment arm through which the frictional
force is transmitted.  I'll have to do some tire swapping to make
actual measurements, but I estimate that the wider tires increase
steering wheel torque by about 25% (less than this wouldn't be
noticable).  Seeing as how bus steering boxes (particularly the
worm-and-peg variety) are fragile to start with, it wouldn't do to
increase the stress on them.
