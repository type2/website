Subject: Re: [T2] porsche style  cooling fan

The Porsche 911 cooling runs on a belt off the cam. the Type IV cooling fan is
on the cam itself. Porsche owners risk burning up their engine if they through
a belt. I like the Type IV design much, much better (after having changed a
few belts on my old 911).

The upgrade sort of makes sense for doghouses (or uprights or whatever you
want to call them) because the fan/alternator/generator configuration is
similar to the Porsche - you just need to fab new standoffs for the alt/gen
and shrouds.

If you really want a cooler running Type IV, borrow another design idea from
the 911: an external oil reservior and cooler. The 78 and later 911s (3.0
liter+) had an oil cooler in the right front wheelwell with lots of tubing in
between - including a thermovalve so the cooler only gets used when the engine
is really hot (not hard to do when you run 5000-6000 rpm in normal driving).
In '87 they added an electric fan to the oil cooler (popular upgrade to
earlier models).

You can make a similar setup for your bus for less than $200. You can even add
an electric fan. I would highly recommend using the thermovalve so your bus
warms up properly - and just learn to live with the extra leaks!

Oh yeah, the 911 reservior holds 11.5 quarts of oil. The owner's manual for my
'86 911 recommended oil changes every 15K miles timed with valve settings.
Interesting things to note: Porsche was still using solid lifters on their
high-end vehicles that late and this was prior to Porsche's switch to Mobil 1,
so the 15K oil change is based on breakdown rates for dino oil. This is after
40+ years of building air-cooled engines and 20+ years of development on that
one particular engine design (the flat-six).

And on an aside, I was heading out to the marina to go sailing with a friend
Sunday and saw a '74 911 sunroof coupe for sale in a church parking lot. The
body was in very good condition for a '74 (no rust, just a few paint chips).
Sign said 'needs engine work' and the price was $3000! It was gone by the time
I finished sailing... Boohoo... The rolling body was worth $3000 even if it
didn't have an engine at all...
