Subject: Re: [T2] high octane gas

And next time you have your engine apart, if you hone
#3 cyl about a thousandth looser than the others, it
will no longer run hotter (unless the airflow is
obstructed.)

When I was running a T4 and had a quad cht gauge I was
able to easily track the trends. What happened with #3
was it started off almost exactly 50 degrees hotter
than #1 and #2&amp;4 were another 25 or so behind. Start
up a long hard pull and #3 rose faster, but the others
all caught up with it such that when it was at maximum
pull, all four were dead even. As soon as I got off
the hill, 2&amp;4 dropped the quickest, followed by #1 and
#3 stayed 50 degrees hotter! When I had #3 honed a bit
looser, it and #1 ran at identical temps.

I always ran 92 octane but I also had 10.8:1
compression ratio on that engine! When I switched to
7.2 CR I ran mid grade 89 octane but coulda run 87
octane. I would still run higher octane on long trips
and really hot weather just for insurance. As long as
the combustion chambers were in perfect condition,
there should be no hot spots - but since I couldn't
see inside I played it safe(r) with premium. Hard
habit to break as I run premium with the subaru motor
by habit. There is a difference with it between
premium and regular. It apparently does change the
timing somewhat, but I can't figure how/why unless it
senses knocking. Maybe it does. -BaH

&gt; My philosophy is that since the #3 cylinder runs
&gt; hotter, there is more danger of detonation or
&gt; pre-ignition in that cyl.  I have hills in my area,
&gt; so
&gt; I run 89 (midgrade _at_ sea level) to give me a little
&gt; extra margin.  If go on a mountain trip (long
&gt; grades),
&gt; I put in the high-test to get even more marging for
&gt; error.
