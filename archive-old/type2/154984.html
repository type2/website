Subject: 72 pushrod tubes

I'll do my best Karl impression...
What kind of engine has 72 pushrod tubes? 18 cylinders with 4 valves per cyl? 36 cyl with 2 valves?

Anyway if the '72 is a Type 4 I'll give you Karl's tip. Pull the pushrod, find a deep socket that just slips into the tube and then use slip joint pliers to grip and pull without crushing the tube. 

I believe Karl is back from his vacation. Who else would put a six pack of Oregon beers and some VW toys in the front seat of my xB?
