Subject: RE: [T2] Insurance Questions

I'm actually a really good driver... ok, well.. I haven't been caught. :) 

No, but honestly, I have had two tickets in my life. I'm 25 now, so my
insurance did drop then. But I am not married (I think that may be a
negative towards my insurance).

I only have one record of an accident, but I wasn't even in the car. My car
was parked at the bank, and some guy in a pickup truck backed into it. I
reported it to my insurance for some stupid reason (I guess I thought I was
supposed to). I wasn't even in the car, and the guy was ticketed and cited
for being under the influence of narcotics. Yet.. they RAISED my insurance
because of that.


The two tickets I had were, 1) not comming to a complete stop at a stop sign
when I was 18, and a 10mph speeding ticket back in late 1998. 

Since then, I haven't even been pulled over for anything (I think that has a
lot to do with the fact that I bought a 4-door white GrandAm, and no longer
drove my V6 Fiero).

But either way, I'm certainly not a major liability by any means.

&gt; 	I was curious what some of you guys use to insure your VW
&gt; Transporters.

before I got married I used Maryland Casualty, (now Farmer's
insurance) but after getting married they wouldn't insure my wife's S*turn
for a reasonable amount and her insurance wouldn't put full coverage on my
bus...(yes I know crazy) so now we actually found insurance from Met Life.

more than $170 a month but both cars have full coverage, including rental
car and mine has an assigned value policy on the bus (extra $200 a
year) and we have much higher than minimum coverage because we both carry
a bunch of kids in the cars occasionally.

  your paying (170X12) about $2040 a year, were paying more than that but
not much, and we live in the downtown area of a major eastern city.

how many accidents and tickets have you gotten recently????
