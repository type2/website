Subject: Find another shop

	Susan,	
	I gotta echo Bob and anyone else who might have replied to your
type2 list posting- get another mechanic. You got it to turn over? 
And the shop can't? Go there in person, see if the symptoms
are the same for you now. Make them show you. I'd be surprised if
it didn't STILL turn over. With the engine not running its HIGHLY
unlikely something happened inside it that would prevent it turning
over. NOT impossible, but highly unlikely. DO check that the gearbox
is in Neutral- maybe they left it in gear by mistake :)
	 I wouldn't be inclinded to let this first garage pull the motor.
Or wipe the windshield.

	Sorry to say, you may have to pay a 'diagnostic fee' to these people
to spring your car. But you'll be better off at another shop, or if
you can't find one, a rented place you can do work in.

	A good mechanic won't be able to tell you what's wrong without
examining the bus, but tell your story and see what they say. Don't
spend YOUR money until you are satisfied with the story the mechanic
tells. You may have to get it explained, you may need to study, or
ask the list, or consult a friend. But its YOUR money, YOUR bus, you
deserve a straight story you can follow and evidence you can examine
and understand.

	I took a sick bus to a VW dealer (big mistake, no aircooled in the
living memory of anyone there...) and at first they wanted to change
the carb. Sorry, I said, nothing wrong with it, try again. They changed
points, plugs, cap, rotor, and said they'd gotten it to run. 2 miles away,
after $200+, it died because they'd left an uninsulated wire in a place
where it drooped, when warm, onto some conductive bit of metal. Bingo!
No sparks, engine doesn't run. Exactly the problem I'd had when I started!
(smell of gas at tail pipe is good evidence that the carb was ok...)
A SECOND tow to a friend's recomended shop produced a complete cure for
cheap- $25 or $50, their minimum look-it-over, for which they fixed the
wire and tightened the fan belt. &quot;A nice, strong engine&quot; they said. They
showed me where the uninsulated wire was. 

	Now if I were REALLY good I'd have fixed it myself. If I were REALLY
determined I would have taken it back to the dealer and badgered them
to fix it right (if they could have...). Basically I got taken for
$200+, but I DID find a good shop. Good judgement comes from experience,
but experience usually comes from bad judgement!
