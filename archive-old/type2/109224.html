Subject: Tear drop trailer substitute?

[I posted this a few minutes ago to the Casting List that I'm a member of,
but thought that it might be of interest here, too.  Tear drop trailers are
expensive, $3000.00 to $4000.00 US, but I think that I can make the one
described below for less than $1000.00.  Maybe less than $750.00...]

I once posted about the almost ridiculous idea of attempting to cast an RV
A/C shell, and a micro travel trailer.

Still working on a concept for the A/C shell, BUT...

... I finally figured the trailer out.  It's roughly 4' x 8', and will most
likely be built on a used VW Beetle chassis to keep the wheels compatible
with the bus.  The molds are simple, and the whole thing shouldn't weigh any
more than a comparable micro RV trailer of it's size.  The shell will be
resin, and the interior and frame 3/4&quot; plywood.

It will sleep two adults comfortably snug (up to 6' 5&quot;), have A/C,
TV/stereo, phone, lights, an insulated structure, micro camping kitchenette,
potable water storage and a bit of dry storage.  I plan on building a 1:10,
12, or 24 scale concept model this winter and will try to post pictures when
it's coming together.

Hopefully it'll be a very cool advertisement for my own business, as well as
for the vendors whose products we carry (maybe small &quot;NASCAR sponsor-style&quot;
resin plates).

The VW bus and beetle communities have always been enamored of the micro
trailer concept.  Might find a strange, new market at VW gatherings...

&quot;Hey, where'd you get that totally awesome trailer, Dude?&quot;

&quot;I'm a toymaker... I cast it myself.&quot; {grin}

&quot;Wow, cool!  Where can I get one?&quot;

&quot;Well, I've got a set of plans right here for the framework and chassis, and
the shell kit runs around...&quot; :O)
