Drumbrakes have spring tension on the shoes, brake system engineers
used a little residual pressure in the brake system to help keep foreign
material out (dirt &amp; water), the master cylinder will have a so-called 
bottom valve (freely translated) that provides this, it will allow brake 
fluid to flow back into the mastercylinder and reservoir after braking, 
but when the pressure in the system drops to a certain value it will 
close and the system will remain presurized but not enough to overcome 
the springtension on the shoes. A diskbrake only has rubber rings in the 
calipers to pull the pistons back into their rest position after braking, 
so connecting a disk brake to a drum brake circuit could cause the pads
to touch the disc all the time. I dono if VW used the bottom valve on
Busses, but look into this if you're about to install disks on your
originally drum brake equipped Bus.
