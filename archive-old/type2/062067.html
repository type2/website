Subject: Back on the list/Body Work

Hello All!

    I've been off the list for over a year. In that time my wife and I finished 


school, spent three months traveling throughout the Southwest, relocated from 


Berkeley, CA to Princeton, NJ, and had a healthy baby boy. Sadly, I accidentally 


piloted Helga (my 1977 bus) into the back end of a cheap Japanese import just 


before moving out east. She is badly banged up and has sat, neglected and 


converting iron to iron oxide, for over a year. Mechanically, however, she is 


fit as a fiddle. My wife and I spent many hours debating on whether to quit our 


&quot;van habit&quot; and invest in a more modern vehicle, or give her a complete 


facelift. We agreed that the best times we've had together are closely linked to 


that van, and so decided to restore her to her her original beauty (or better) 


and maintain her as a legacy for our newborn son.


    And so for the questions:





    1) We have been cut off from our CA VW connections. Can anyone recommend 


people for body work and mechanics in the central New Jersey area?





    2) Does anyone know where to find original color patterns for 1977?





    3) Does anyone on this list plan on attending the October 6 VW show in 


Englishtown NJ?





    Thank you all for your help. I'll keep in touch and post photos of the 


progress.


                        Regards,


                        Eric Engelhard (engelharde_at_pt.cyanamid_dot_com)
