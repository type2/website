&gt;Chris,
&gt;
&gt;I'm gonna ramble thru my thought process here...
&gt;Vacum gauge shows good...so probably not cam, valve or lifter
&gt;problems...hmmmm
&gt;
&gt;I might check lift at the valves for #1 &amp; #2 just to be sure that you
&gt;didn't have something weird going on there....shorter/longer pushrod by
&gt;chance???

Not likely


&gt;Rocker arm is not loose on that side? Correct rockers on 1 &amp; 2??

Probably not, but I'll check the torque on those nuts (it seems that I 
_might_ have heard some chuffing under load that you will usually hear when 
the heads work loose).
&gt;
&gt;I am also assuming stock vacuum advance dist....if it is stock dist, then
&gt;timing for #3 should be a little retarded over the others....could you
&gt;have dist 180 degrees off and somehow have retard that is supposed to be
&gt;on #3 on #2?  I can't imagine such a thing, but it is worth checking the
&gt;timing on all 4(not just #1).  This will show spark on #2 as well...always
&gt;get spark, or is it missing cause no spark is getting there?...if the
&gt;timing light always shows spark(no dropouts) then probably something else.

Timing light is strong and no dropouts through all RPM ranges.

&gt;Might also be why the 009 seemed a little better as there is not a retard
&gt;for #3 on 009 distributors (late model ones anyway).

This is an older 009, which is cause for concern, in that the shaft (on BOTH 
distributors, anyway, shows a little lateral play).  I'm using the 009 right 
now, because it seems to run better.  When hooked back up, all wires ran to 
the appropriate cylinders, so apparently it is NOT180 degrees out.

INTERESTINGLY ENOUGH, WHEN COLD, AND I'M GETTING MOST OF THE MISSING, WHEN I 
HOLD THE SPARK PLUG WIRE AWAY AND I GET ARCING, THE SYMPTOM GOES AWAY, (I'm 
shouting here because this is an interesting finding in my opinion).  It has 
followed through all the ignition changes, suggesting a problem with the long 
block, though I can't imagine.  These are (as far as I know) NEW heads.

&gt;Something in the intake causing the fuel to condense again (not be in vapor
&gt;state) on the way to #2?

?????  You might have something here.  I have noticed crud on the outside of 
the manifold,  (aerosolized oil from the breather box?), which was not there 
before the rebuild (manifold is cooler and not burning stuff off?).  

&gt;You say that you switched plugs?  Try switching what you have between #1
&gt;and #2 and see if it follows the plug.

Done that -- no change.

&gt;Try switching the wires between #1 and #2 and see what follows(if any).
&gt;
&gt;Shrouded spark plug? from the head being rebuilt?  Spark plug not exposed
&gt;in the cylinder head properly?

What's a shrouded spark plug?  I see no carbon beyond the threads, suggesting 
that it is seated well.  Bosch W8AC plugs, by the way.
