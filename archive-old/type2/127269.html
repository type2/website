Subject: Re: [T2] Squeaky wheel

&gt; I have a 71 camper with a squeaky rear (I think) wheel which seems to get
&gt; louder the longer the trip.  but it stops when I apply the breaks very
&gt; lightly.
&gt;
&gt; Can this be written off as dirty brake pads or is it more the wheel
&gt; bearings...?  How do I know...the fact it seems to get louder as the trip
&gt; goes on makes me think I need to get in there and grease something...but i'm
&gt; clueless.

What sort of squeak?
It could be a loose rear axle nut. Get some new cotter pins beforehand.
Pull the cotter pins and check the torque on the axle nuts.

Then again maybe its a brake or bearing thing but I would check the nuts
first.
