&gt;        Yesterday I got one from ,&quot;Parts Place inc.&quot;.  Prices look OK, don't
&gt;be in a hurry if you order the catalog.  I don't even remember ordering this
&gt;catalog, so it must have been forever ago that I ordered it.

I ordered some parts from them, they came in a timely manner, they were what
I ordered and they fit. What more can I say?
