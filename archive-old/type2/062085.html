Subject: Inuvik Expedition - The Dempster Highway

Journal entries during the &quot;Top of the World Tour&quot; from Vancouver
to Inuvik, NWT.  This chapter takes me up the Dempster highway 
from Dawson City, Yukon to Inuvik, NWT.

Tues, 7/30
 We get a late start at 11am.  Sue's boilover in the diesel Westy
revealed a leaky coolant tank.  Bob helps her patch the plastic tank
and get underway.

 Most of this highway is built on permafrost.  To make a stable road 
surface the engineers first build a levee out of rocks from a moraine 
or shale chips to a height of 3 to 40 feet. On top of the levee is 
gravel, mud and calcium carbonate (?) to form a &quot;crust&quot;.

 There was construction on the first 20 Km.  Canada has the prettiest
construction flag operators I've ever seen.  At nearly every construction
zone you'll find a lady flagging you down to warn you of the situation
ahead; A large grader pushing a pile of fresh gravel flat using a long 
blade scraper.  The grader had one lane and the traffic had to share the 
other.  Along the way we had to drive over a 2' high berm of gravel and
stay on the ungraded side of the highway.  Sue went over the berm and
into the trees off the side of the roadway.  A tractor pulled her out
using a tow strap.  She was shaken, but not broken and able to continue.

 Coyote wanted to get a caravan photo showing all campers in a line
bumper-to-bumper.  It takes a good long time and I get nervous should a
car or truck approach us at a dead stop and nowhere to go.  The photo was
snapped and we're back underway.  On the road a new Ford sedan passed
each and every one of us in the convoy.  By the time they passed the leader
they were really upset and drove away very fast. 

 We make another stop at Tombstone Mt. for more photo oportunities. We
got a late start and a couple stops both planned and unplanned were made
already.  Not feeing like posturing and posing, I opted to follow Eddie
up the Dempster to Eagle Plains at a slower pace and let the rest catch up.

 Along the way we find a family of tourists waving us down.  Eddie checks
to see that everyone is ok, then heads back down the road to a road worker
truck.  While Eddie's away I make a distress call on CB ch9, then again
on our ch2 to warn the convoy.  There's noone around for a mile or so and
certainly no cars in view yet the family is still frantically waving down
traffic.  Hmm.  They were swatting mosquitoes which were swarming out of
the ditch where the Ford rested.  I loaned them my Off bug spray and got back 
in my VW.  It looked like they were going 100Kmh, got onto the right shoulder
then tried to turn back onto the road.  Their tires were in the &quot;marbles&quot;
and lost traction, slid into the ditch then rolled once stopping with the
shiny side up.  The Dempster takes another victim.  An orange highway worker
truck and a biker arrive (must have been monitoring ch9) to save them.

 I continue to follow Eddie at a steady speed of 50 mph.  There's snow on
the road in some places.  We slow down and slog through the slippery road.
The Dempster dust has been replaced with mud.  It goes on like stucco and
sticks better.  Tobin and Eddie stop to refuel from the Jerry cans and Neil 
and I go on to find the Eagle Plains gas stop only 7 Km ahead.

 Eagle Plains has a diner and a lounge with pool tables and darts.  On the
walls of the lounge there are documents that chronicle the Mad Trapper.
It stays light through the clouds.  All through the night it lightly pisses 
down a chilly rain. At 1am it's time to crash.


Wed, 7/31
  2:30 am comes and it's still light out and still drizzling.  I take a hot
shower then back to sleep.  8am wakeup call.  I get up and get ready for
the rest of the Dempster.  As usual, we don't actually roll until 11am.

 Don's Vanagon is getting 10 mpg so he leaves it here at Eagle Plains. He
and his dog, Casey, join me in my van for the Inuvik run.  I'm not quite
prepared for this as Casey steps on my breakfast and CB radio.  Casey is a 
really smart Aust. shepard with alot of instinct.  I should have known better 
then to leave my stuff in the aisle of the walk-thru.

 Up north of EP we find more gravel road and a landscape of green hills and
smooth rock mountains.  This must be the places not covered in glacier during
the last ice age.  The trees in B.C. were giants containing many board feet
of lumber.  Up here the trees are only 20 feet tall and consist of mostly
one stalk with stubby, half-dead branches.  Ivette says they look sad.
In some places the sad trees are all gone.  Trees don't grow very well in
the tundra.

 At the arctic circle we stop for more choreography.  Sue uses her GPS locator 
and finds that 66*33' lattitude is just up the road a little ways from the 
signpost.  Bob changes a tire.  Farther up the road Eddie would lose a shock 
absorber, then a brake cyl, then a tire all on the left rear. The Dempster 
clutches at his bus but Eddie pulls it away.

 Ivette, Jorge and I stopped for lunch at a cafe in Ft.McPherson.  I remember
this was the worst cheeseburger I have ever eaten.  We found ourselves at the 
tail end of the convoy.  Across one ferry and haul ass to the one at Arctic 
Red R. to catch up.  As we approach the ferry landing I remember hearing someone 
call &quot;go straight to the ferry, don't stop.&quot;  Well, this struck me as funny as 
there was no other option.  The only thing at the end of this road is the ferry.
We pulled in line for the next ferry behind Bob.  As the ferry was preparing
to dock another call came out on channel 2, &quot;What are you guys _doing_ back there?&quot;
&quot;We're having a weenie roast on the beach.&quot; sent out in reply.  There's nothing
here to do except watch the ferry slowly land on the beach.

 About 10 Km outside of Inuvik the gravel turns to pavement.  My fuel gauge
says empty and shortly thereafter I run the tank dry.  Jerry can to the rescue.
At a fuel station up the road we come upon the rest of the group.  Christa CB
calls for everyone to line up bumper to bumper for a parade into downtown Inuvik.
We wait another good long time, then creep along at 20 mph.  Dangerous.  All this
posing for the press and paparazzi will cause trouble one of these times.  In the 
end the parade never goes downtown and is diverted to a camp at Chuk Territorial 
Park for the night, so it was all for naught.

 There's the equivalent of a &quot;florida room&quot; at the camp.  A building with large
screen windows and a woodfired stove.  There is a convocation for all of our
Vanagon people to toast and Tobin and Christa's awards ceremony.  Now it seems 
we have made it to the end of the road.
