Subject: Compression test results--Advice?
Message-ID: &lt;Pine.OSF.3.95.990510140807.31254A-100000_at_unicorn.it.wsu_dot_edu&gt;

Finally got around to doing a compression test on the bus I bought 2
months ago.
First Shot:
#1  120psi
#2  120psi
#3  30psi
#4  102psi

Added some oil--is 3-in-1 oil OK to use?--to cylinders 3 and 4.

Second shot:
#3  35psi
#4  115psi

Can anybody expalin to me what is likely going on and the reccomended
solution for cylinder #3?

TIA

Dan
