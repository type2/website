&gt;73 Westy How are the heater cables attached to the lever assembly?  I've
&gt;got the metal plate with 3 notches in it but nothing to attach it down to

Ok, I'll give it a shot since I just did mine.

This is also described in a post in the library, but wasnt completely
clear to me until I took mine apart.

The end of the metal tube that comes from the front of the bus that
the cable runs through should have a white plastic plug that fits
in the end of the tube. It has a slit through one side so you can
put the cable through it.

Moving toward the rear, you will find the metal plate with 3 open
holes in it. There is a rubber accordian thing about 3-4&quot; long that
slides over the rear and of the cable and it engages in one of the
3 holes. There is a metal circlip that goes around this rubber
piece that holds it in the metal plate.
