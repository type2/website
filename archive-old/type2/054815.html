Subject: RE: VW parts in Canada

&gt; Subject: Canadian VW Parts
&gt; 
&gt; Does anyone know of a list of sources for VW parts in Canada?  Ordering
&gt; from
&gt; the US is often sketchy thanks to our friends at Canadian Customs - ya
&gt; just
&gt; never know how long things will take to get through nor what kind of
&gt; brokerage fees people like UPS will charge (they once charged my brokerage
&gt; fees of $35 (Can) on $50 (US) worth of parts).
&gt; 
	[Crick, Bill ]  Have your parts sent by parcel post if possible.
	Canada post will broker smaller amount orders for $5.00cdn.
	They do it quite quickly, and for several orders I've done, or
	used parts people were sending me, 
	they haven't bothered to even charge the $5.00.
	I too have had the $50 brokering charge on some used parts someone
	was sending me for free, which turned out to not be worth
	the money I paid for them ;-) let alone courier charge, and
	$50 brokering fees!!!!
