Subject: Re: [T2] Loose Shifter

I just purchased all the shift rod bushings for my 70 Single Cab from
Wolfsburg West................ and I mean all even the one that is usually
NLA................


I was experiencing a lot of slop in the shifter, so since the motor is out
for rebuild, I am going to do the shifter at this time.

&gt; Howdy All -
&gt; Is it normal for my shifter to have a lot of freeplay while in gear?
&gt; Lately it seems like there is more looseness and freeplay than usual.  For
&gt; example, when I move the shifter up into 1st gear, it goes into gear just
&gt; fine (no grinding or anything) but once it is in and I let go, the thing
&gt; just seems to fall loosely to the side - while in gear, there is so much
&gt; freeplay that it seems like I can move the shifter more than 6 inches to
&gt; either side.  The same is true for the three other gears: all engage
&gt; smoothly, but the shifter just seems so loose in there once engaged that
&gt; sometimes I feel like the thing is going to  break off or fall apart one
of
&gt; these times.  One other thing I've noticed is that during the first few
&gt; miles of driving during a given day, when shifting from 1st down into 2nd,
&gt; the shifter seems to make a rattling sound (as opposed to grinding) as it
&gt; goes into 2nd, as if passing through something loose down in there - for
&gt; some reason this seems to improve as the bus warms and eventually goes
&gt; away.  Anyway, I have read stuff here over time about the &quot;shift coupler&quot;
&gt; and associated &quot;bushings&quot; down there (I'm working from memory here, so
&gt; please forgive me if my terminology is incorrect) - would these be likely
&gt; culprits, or is what I'm experiencing sound normal?  Is there something I
&gt; can adjust or tighten?  Thanks for any help/information you can send
&gt; across!
