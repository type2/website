&gt; Ok. Well Im pretty sure that its the heat exchanger. Thats what it
&gt; looks like to me. Its right below and to the side kinda of the heads

sure sounds like exchangers. I believe you are right.

&gt; Then there is a
&gt; tube thing that connects each of them to these long cannals that
&gt; goes to the front. So now that we are all on the same page and you
&gt; know what I'm talking about (cause you do right??) What is the whole
&gt; purpose behind it. Is it only for heating purposes?? 

Well, yes &amp; no. Take a close look at the system. It is reasonably
straightforward in it's design. The exchangers insides are part of the
exhaust system. it's a finned piece of metal that pipes the exhaust
gasses to your muffler &amp; then out the side. The outside metal (which
you see) is what makes it possible to get heat from the engine. The
engine (&amp; also aux fan) push air into the exchangers &amp; across the
finned insides to transfer heat from the hot exhaust metal to the cool
air. this air is transfered via ductwork to your windshield defroster
&amp; other heater vents. including those on your toes :) Without this air
you cannot heat the bus, not that that matters much in CA, but you
will not have a functional defroster. I believe some safety regs
require that to be functional (i don't know for sure, ask proper
authorities)

&gt; How do you
&gt; remove it? Could I drive with it removed?? I live in California and
&gt; when do you ever need a heater in California? 

If it were removed you would have to replace it with some sort of
exhaust system, so this isn't really what you want anyway.

&gt; The reason that I am
&gt; asking is that I finally got around to taking things upon myself and
&gt; adjusting my own valves and the damn heat exchanger thing is right
&gt; in the way!! I was having a bear of a time adjusting them and I was
&gt; hoping that I could just take them out without any damage. Well Hope
&gt; someone will give me some feedback on this one. Thanks

yes those darn things do get in the way, but rest assured that there
is enough room to get the valve cover off &amp; adjust your valves. I use
a good thick screwdriver &amp; a box end wrench. good luck, this is the
best way to keep tabs while owning a VW :)
