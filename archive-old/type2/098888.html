Subject: Re: [T2] Engine degreasing

	I used to be a happy user of Gunk's spray products but
they're petro-chemical solvent based (not water based) and the 
runoff isn't good for anyone. So I switched years ago to using 
good old  Orange Hand Cleaner, non-abrasive. Gojo or whatever. 
It worked best in the 'scientific' three-way try-out I did on my rear
engine support too. Beat Simple Green AND Gunk spray.

	Use a sharp stream of water to wet the engine, or whatever
you're cleaning, and knock off the loose chunks. 

	Apply orange hand cleaner using a stiff brush with a comfortable 
handle. A toilet brush will do but a scrubbing brush is better. Work
the cleaner and grime mixture until you don't feel anything
else coming loose or mixing in. Use a couple hose-clamps to 
attach an old broom handle to your brush and you can reach way in
without the gunge falling on you if cleaning an installed engine.

	Let it sit for 30-60 minutes. Longer in cold weather.

	Scrub AGAIN, now that the stuff that got damp during the
soak is soft. Keep scrubbbing until you don't see the cleaner
getting any dirtier or don't feel anything else breaking loose.

	Rise with the sharp spray, scrub while you rinse.
SCRUB HARD. (True for Gunk or Simple Green too).

	I used to part the car or parts being rinsed over my lawn
and didn't to it any lasting harm with the above procedure.

	Working on clean stuff is far superior to working on dirty
stuff.

	Bill
