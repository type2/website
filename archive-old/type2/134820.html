Subject: RE: [T2] KONI Shock Group Buy - UPDATE

&gt; The Bus Depot wrote:
&gt;  Good news - we just hit the 15 set minimum order required
&gt; to go ahead  with the Koni shock group buy!  So it's definitely on!

&gt; After browsing I'm guessing these Koni's are only appropriate
&gt; for buses, and vanagons can take shocks still being manufactured?
&gt;
&gt; Are the Koni's superior to other air shocks that might fit?


I will have Vanagon Koni's as well. They are still in production, unlike the
bus ones. I will also have splitty and Eurovan ones. In order to get a good
deal on the Bus ones we all wanted, I basically had to agree to buy some of
the others as well. But after speaking to Koni at length at the SEMA show, I
wan't afraid to do that. The engineering behind these shocks impressed me.
One major  difference between them and Bilstein, Boge, etc. is that they are
user adjustable upon installation, so you can &quot;dial in&quot; the ride you like.
