Subject: Re: [T2] battery cable reversal

You'll have to verify this but I think all you may need is a new battery...
Let us know.

Subject: [T2] battery cable reversal


&gt; just bought a bus today 1971, westie, wasn't running but fantasic
California
&gt; body and general wear and tear, but I got it home and was going to jump it
to
&gt; se if I could get it running. I hooked up the cables on my truck then
stuck
&gt; them on the far cable in the bus then went to hook up the front one, giant
&gt; spark, so I looked a little closer and noticed that the PO had bought a
&gt; battery with the terminals on the wrong sides, the positive was near the
back
&gt; of the bus and the negative on the inside, so he must have just hooked up
the
&gt; cables without looking, so the cable leading to the starter was on the
neg.
&gt; and the ground cable from the body was on the pos. Does this sound wrong
and
&gt; what has been affected beside the starter that won't turn over now once I
&gt; reset the cables. thanks.
