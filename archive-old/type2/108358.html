Subject: Re: [T2] Clutch cable

Man- Look at CIP's website. They only list 2 sizes, one for early and one
for late, and they don't correlate to those sizes. Maybe that's why you hear
so many complaints about cables being too long. They've cut it down to 2
generic lengths that aren't really right for anything? Tom

&gt; Will a 72-79 cable work in my '71?  Please let me know.  My local VW guy
&gt; only has a late bay cable.  I was driving to school this morning and it
&gt; broke.  I had a cable but the wrong one.  It was for my '60!

55-65    3564mm
65-67    3576mm
68-69    3670mm
69-71    3680mm
72       3700mm
73-74    3655mm
76-79MT  3458mm
76-79AT  2870mm


so the quick answer is no, but maybe you can make a longer one work
