Subject: Generator on '71 Bus

I have a '71 bus, which I just put an external oil cooler in.  When I got=
 the engine back in, and everything back in, I noticed the Generator ligh=
t was on.  I had noticed, when I removed the Field connection from the re=
gulator (DF), that the bottom nut was loose and the stud was turning.  My=
 theory was that I had broken a wire loose from the inside.  I pulled the=
 generator again, and sure enough, the wire was broken.  I got in there w=
ith a soldering iron and re-soldered the connection, put everything back =
together, and the light was out!  Went for a test drive, everything was f=
ine, but when I got back and shut off the ignition, the Gen light came on=
!  According to Muir, this is a bad regulator, so I replaced it.  The old=
 one was definitely burnt on the back (some sort of fusible link), but th=
e problem is still there.

My question is, is the generator permanently damaged?  The wire I re-sold=
ered appears to be in good shape.  Is the stud the wire goes to shorted t=
o the case?  Could that have fried the regulator?  Do I just need to spen=
d the $100 for a new generator?  Did I fry the new regulator, too?  It's =
one of those new electronic ones, which I would hope would be protected? =
 How can I determine these things?

Please respond directly to me at glensherwood480_at_msn_dot_com, and thanks for =
your help.

s great!)
