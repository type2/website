Subject: tools/parts needed for rotor &amp; bearing install

hello list.

i just picked up my new-to-me 77 Riviera this weekend.  it drove &amp;
handled great on the highway with the new Yoko Y356Ds on it.

the first thing for me to get working correctly is the front brakes.

i am planning on installing new pads, rotors, flexi lines and
bearnings on the front of the vehicle.

my questions are:
1) what tools am i going to need for the bearing
install? i am thinking just a punch &amp; hammer, but is there
anything else?

2) i was planning on ordering the rotors from Bus Depot. does
anyone know if those come with the bearing outer race 
pre-installed, or will i have to do that?

oh yeah, one more thing - can anyone point me to a good article
in the library regarding adjusting a clutch? (don't have my Bentley
handy)

TIA. hopefully this bus will be ready for EveryBus.
