Subject: RE: [T2] vanagon seats &amp; more

Rob,

Looks to me like the top part of the valve guide.

The part that sticks out above the boss in the head on the valve spring 
side.  I suspect that you/they?  were lucky that the valve actually stayed 
on the spring.

I might also suspect that the head that you have may be incredibly 
cracked.

Please take pics when you get it out...this is gonna be interesting!

Cheers, dave

&gt; &gt; If these are the heads you just destroyed,
&gt; &gt; then no :). As i recall, you sucked #1 exhaust
&gt; &gt; guide into the combustion chamber, but left
&gt; &gt; the valve, spring, retainer, and keepers,.intact ?
&gt; &gt; Thiis is most unusual. I can't see how anything
&gt; &gt; ( other than the valve seat ) could get past the
&gt; &gt; exhaust valve while the engine is running,
&gt; &gt; much less leaving it intact. Photos ?!
&gt; &gt; What were the circumstances ?
&gt; 
&gt; Not sure of the circumstances, a friend gave me this
&gt; engine in it's current condition, he had only owned it
&gt; a couple of weeks.  Best I can tell it's never
&gt; been rebuilt.
&gt; 
&gt; Of course I wouldn't bolt a bad head on to the 82 shortblock.  I have
&gt; high hopes that the bad head can be rebuilt.  I don't
&gt; have any pictures of the head &amp; piston yet, but when
&gt; I pulled the valve cover off, look what fell out:
&gt; http://pipeline.uncwil_dot_edu/temp/little_metal_thing.jpg
&gt; I ran it through my scanner, woulda stuck the head on there
&gt; too my but my wife wouldn't let me :-)
&gt; 
&gt; As for the head, there is a layer of gold colored metal
&gt; that appears to have been hammered onto the lower surface
&gt; of the head, meaning the semi-circular flat area between the 
&gt; valve seats and the mating surface.  The pretty, shiny gold
&gt; metal also covers the lower portion of the piston.  The exhaust
&gt; valve looks nicked, but other than that it's still there, spring, 
&gt; retainer and all, hard to view the seat (no spring compressor yet)
&gt; but it appears to be there.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks,
&gt; 
&gt; Rob
