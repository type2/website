X-Diagnostic: MESSAGE MAY NOT BE TOPICAL

The attached file in the otherwise empty message &quot;Rear Door
Hinge....springs&quot; posted by &quot;Tom Cullen&quot; is identified by the latest copy
of Norton Antivirus as the Happy.99 worm. The description given is:

&quot;This worm modifies WSOCK32.DLL to send itself as an attachment when a
posting is made to Usenet or Mail. Delete SKA.EXE and SKA.DLL in the
WINDOWS\SYSTEM folder and replace WSOCK32.DLL with WSOCK32.SKA in the
WINDOWS\SYSTEM folder.&quot;

This is probably not a problem unless you ran the attachment. If you did
run the attachment, or you have a brain-dead mail client that ran it
automatically, you need to disinfect.

-E.
