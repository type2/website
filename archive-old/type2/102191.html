Subject: Re: [T2] Is my engine doomed?

As I understand it and based on my experience in 4-5 rebuilds the only 
ferrous metal is going to be in the cylinders, rods, rings, crank, oil 
pumps, etc.

The pistons and bearings are non-ferrous.

The facts that you continue to find ferrous metal tells me that you should 
save your money and buy some books (if need be) and plan on a tear down 
soon. It may save something expensive (relatively expensive). Maybe the 
crank or rod.

Meanwhile that junk is eating at your crank and rods and case. I'd get it 
out and apart.



&gt;I have changed the oil three times since and do not like what I see. It
&gt;comes with a sort of iridescence, and close examination shows tiny flecks of
&gt;bright metal. Also, it has an acrid instead of sweet smell, even though it
&gt;has only been in the engine a few hundred miles.
&gt;
&gt;I tried to tell myself this was the last particles of burned piston being
&gt;ground and polished to final oblivion, but when I passed a magnet over
&gt;flakes that had settled, they stuck to the magnet, indicating steel. I'm
&gt;pretty sure the piston was aluminum or other nonferrous metal.
&gt;
&gt;It seems I've got one or more bearings going south, but  I thought I'd asked
&gt;more experienced VW-ers on this list if I'm missing something-- if the
&gt;particles could be the new rings breaking or something else--before I take
&gt;'er out and do a full rebuild.
