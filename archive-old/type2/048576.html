&gt;Has anyone out there ever lowered the suspension on a bus??  I'm not
talking about slamming it on the ground, but more like a 2 inch drop,
especially for the front end.  I do a lot of mountain (OK, really a big
hill) driving, with lots of windy twists.  Lowering the center of gravity
would make it handle better.  I know the best way to lower almost any
suspension is to either get lowered springs or dropped spindles, but nobody
makes dropped spindles for a late bus.  Twisting the torsion leaves would
work, but would make the ride a little harsh.  Anybody have any suggestions??

Jim,

I personally believe you would be better served by upgrading your shocks
if necessary to Bilstein or Koni and adding better sway bars as previously
suggested by another listee.
Busses has good clearance and being able to get under there without
a jack to change an oil filter or adjust the clutch cable,or give that starter
solonoid a good whack occasionally is a luxury (relative term in a Type2)
that few other vehicles have.
However if you still want to do the lowering thing,it might be worth
checking out:        http://www.kruizinwagon_dot_com.au/

I know they are a bit far away for you to to drive over and talk to them
but they have a lot of good info and products available to lower
busses safely.Have a look at the website and see what the lowered busses
and double cabs look like at least...
