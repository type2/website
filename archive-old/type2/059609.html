Subject: brake fluid

DOT 3 and 4 are compatible.  The only advantage, that I know of, in using
the DOT 4 is a higher boiling point.  This might make a difference if you
drive really hard in the mountains and get your brakes really hot.  I drove
my '71 to the top of Pike's Peak once and they had signs everywhere saying
&quot;HOT BRAKES FAIL&quot;.  Does anyone know of any other differences in the two
fluids?  I'm not talking about DOT 5.  It's evidently lots different but I'm
not sure it's worth the hassle.
