On yesterday's communications, Jim inquired why the 1800 ED from 1974 with 
dual carbs and manual transmission didn't run right at either 5 ATDC or 5 
BTDC. Checking the Bentley, the distributor model number that he is using 
does not match with the one designed for that year and engine; in fact it 
didn't appear to belong to the type 4 engine series at all. Interestingly, 
the ED engine in 74 with dual carbs was supposed to be used with automatic 
transmissions only, originally. So, until Jim determines the characteristics 
of his distributor, or gets the proper one, he'll be having trouble getting 
the engine to run right. It appears that quite a few changes have been made 
in the vehicle since it rolled off the assembly line.
