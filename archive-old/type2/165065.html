Subject: Re: [T2] decibel

but since it is much less time than an 
&gt; occupational exposure I would not fret about hearing loss. 

The permissable expousure time to 97dB is 30 minutes, I am at 98dB almost any time I am in motion, I am fretting about it, initially I hadn't expected the numbers to be so high and just wanted to play with improving it to make conversation and music more enjoyable and to reduce driving fatigue, now I am worried about my overall health.
