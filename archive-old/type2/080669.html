Bill,
	I was forced to go with what ever my FLAPS had because the
vaccum leak I had was progressing at a rapid rate.  As you can see, some
are a tight fit, and my hands still show how hard they where to get to
work LOL.

Troy,
Are the larger hoses you replaced VW hoses or did you match something up

at the local auto parts store?

&gt;Christopher,
&gt;	I went and took some pics of my engine bay and posted them on my
&gt;site.  Check them out here.  www.wicals_dot_com/troy/vw/enginebay/index.htm
&gt;I did not compress these images as to hopefully give you as much detail
&gt;as possible.  I just replaced all my vaccum lines recently as well as
&gt;the throttle body gasket and it did a world of help.  I would highly
&gt;recommend this be done if your lines look worn.  Also look at the fuel
&gt;lines.  Let me know if you need different angles or more pics.  
&gt;
&gt;Good luck

&gt;fellow listmembers......
&gt;
&gt;I have been working on finding all of the &quot;this isn't connected to
&gt;anything&quot;
&gt;type stuff
&gt;and putting it all back together regardless of how important it seems,
&gt;and
&gt;still working
&gt;on these tubes that come out of the fuel system someplace, I believe to
&gt;help
&gt;it breathe.
&gt;
&gt;The top right hand side of my charcoal canister, there is a thin little
&gt;tube
&gt;that goes noplace
&gt;currently, and I think that is part of this same system.

&gt;
&gt;Here is a pic of what I do have now, I think I am definetly missing
some
&gt;of
&gt;those items.
&gt;Could you take a look at this and see what I'll need to get this put
&gt;back
&gt;together correctly?
&gt;
&gt;Just not sure what I need to order, or if I can get what I need at a
&gt;hardware store/flaps to fix this?
&gt;
&gt;thanks for any tips, info, tomfoolery you can shed on the subject...
&gt;
&gt;Christopher
