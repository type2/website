The message I posted to stated &quot;GL5 synthetic&quot; which is what I had put in my
Westy.
You are not giving an honest opinion by saying you use Redline GL4
synthetic.
Unless you think GL4 and GL5 is the same.....in that case you'd better do a
little more homework before answering....
Let's compare apples to apples.


&gt; I guess everybody has a different story when it comes to the use of
&gt; synthetics. I use Redline 75w-90 in my transaxle, and Mobile 1 15w-50 in
my
&gt; eng. Both are synthetic based oils, and the Redline is GL-4. My rig is a '
78
&gt; 2.0L FI Westy, with 127k original miles, on the original eng./trans. I'm
the
&gt; second owner. The first put 52k on her before selling to me. I immedatly
&gt; switched over to the above mentioned lubes, without so much as a hint of a
&gt; problem. No leaks, no clutch shudder, no nothing. Just a tranny that
shifts
&gt; like a hot knife thru butter, even at -13f, and an eng. that still tests
at
&gt; 137psi all around, with a leak-down of less than 7% per cyl. I tend to
push
&gt; this machine to it's limits( my shift point is between 3700-4100rpm, and
I'll
&gt; push 75mph on the hi-way.)Prolonged oil temps of 240-260 don't even faze
me.
&gt; 75k later, I'd say synthetics pay off.
&gt; FWIW,
