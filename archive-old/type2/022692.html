Subject: Westy Sighting I5 near Camp Pendleton, CA
Date: Thu, 18 Mar 1999 15:37:36 -0800
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

Hello ALL,

I saw a really cool thing I haven't seen in a long time.  It was a boat that
mounts over the top of a Westy.  It was on a white Westy heading North on
Interstate 5 near Camp Pendleton, CA.  I think it was last Sunday about
12pm.  Is it anyone on the list?  Anyone know if these boats are available
anywhere or have one for sale?
