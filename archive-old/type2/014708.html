Subject: sliding door started what year??
To: type2_at_type2_dot_com

I know this is pretty much a vintage page question but I also feel we all 
stick together regardless of year.  Air cooled stick together that is.  Now 
for the question.  The 65 I just picked up has a sliding door and all the 
ones I've had in the past have been double doors.  Are the parts and 
maintenance the same as the later model sliding door buses?  The 
undercarriage is immaculate and I'm looking forward to parking this bad boy 
beside the Westy (76)  as soon as it is ready.
Peace Out
