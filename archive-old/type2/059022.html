Subject: Re: Aftermarket sunroof

&gt;I want a sunroof in my '74 bus and I am thinking of installing an after market
&gt;unit. The archives seem to indicate that this can be done.
&gt;My questions:
&gt;Any recommendations re manufactures?
&gt;Any recommendations re type (i.e. sliding ragtag, or other)?

Back when I had the 71, the PO (or one of his enemies) had installed a
smoke-colored liftup sunroof over the cab. The sort of thing you expect to
find in a Celica or something.

It was quite an improvement if you like sun in your eyes and rain in your lap.

But on the other hand, at least it did not help with ventilation in any
discernible way. 8)

I have a nifty 81 Vanagon w/factory sunroof stashed somewhere in California
if you want the real deal. Make an offer. My wife continually reminds me
about the enormity of my mortgage and it's gonna have to go sometime.
