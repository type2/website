Subject: Dead Bus on My Road trip! Stuck in LA! Help!

Hi all, made it thru Jerome for the show. One of the best events I have
ever attended, bus related or otherwise. After a week of layover and tune
up, I trecked out across the desert on I-10 thru Blyth, CA. Shortly there
after,  wind, heat, and a few minutes of mind wandering did my engine in.
I caught the oil temp on it's way up past 260 degrees on my VDO, and man,
did it skyrocket up up up! Immediately pulled over and cooled it down (by
letting the fan run in neutral). I was too late. The knocking started
about 10 miles down the road after I cooled down. Got worse. Couldn't
stop, I was over 60 miles from ANYTHING!!! Looked for metal in the oil
from the dipstick. None (yet). Oil was warm, but did not look like it
broke down. I guess it did somewhere in the engine. Anyway, I decided to
forge on to LA, another 125 miles. Took it real easy;  didnt want to
camp in the desert that evening, and the damage had already been done.

So now I'm in Pasadena (LA area) and I'm doing an autopsy (sniffle).
This engine had only 10500 miles on it. It _was_ an ATK rebuild. It
remains to be seen if waranty will cover it. Personally, I'd like to know
if overheating failed the bearing, or if the bearing caused the
overheating. Probably will never know.

So here's where i stand:
Carefull listening thru a stethiscope has determined a bering is failing
in number 3 cyl. Unsure which bearing it is though. Others may also be
damaged. Metal was found in the strainer for the oil pickup. Steel
(magnetic). Still runs but the knocking grows louder . . .

If possibly, could some LA listees list me a few shops that do good,
honest 2.0 L rebuilds? If the price is right, rebuilding this block would
be good, as there are no holes in it yet, and everything else is new or
rebuilt. Only a few parts to replace. But I'm NOT doing it my self. No
confidence in that, yet.

Or should I just get a new block? What other weak points might bite me in
the ass if I rebuild this one?

I really don't know what to do. Help! I'd like to save this bus, as I love
her to death. But the final possibily is to *gulp* sell her. Help me save
her!

Any help appreciated!
E-mail here or call 626-398-0890 ask for Chris!

TIA
Chris and INDGIO!
