Quoth firefly1_at_intop_dot_net:

&gt; Does anyone know where I can find the boots on the rear shift rod
&gt; for my '71?  All three of mine are shredded(2 on the rod; 1 on
&gt; tranny).  Also, I can't find the shift rod REAR nylon bushing.  Got
&gt; the front one on order.

I have a fairly recent Wolfsburg West catalog that shows the boots as 
p/n 211 711 183B &quot;Boot, shift rod, 1957-1979, two per car&quot; _at_ $6.00 -- 
this is a 5/97 price sheet, BTW.

I've ordered mine through Ron at the Bus Depot -- he had to do some 
digging but I *think* he may be able to find the whole shebang -- 
boots and all *three* bushings.  Don't forget the plastic bushing 
inside the nose of the front shift rod.

Other part numbers per WW and RMMW (who carries the nose bushing and 
front rod bushing):

nose bushing 211 711 197
front rod bushing 211 711 179
rear rod bushing 211 711 185B

Are those confusing or what?  BTW the WW catalog shows #179 as NLA, 
but it's in the new RMMW catalog.  I advise comparing the new &amp; old 
bushings CLOSELY when received.  And if Bus Depot gets stumped, I'd 
appreciate knowing other sources for this stuff.

getting darned well-read on '71 shift-rod bushings,
joe
