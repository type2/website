Subject: Brake Servo 1973 - Problems

I was installing a new master cylindar on my bus and I noticed that brake
fluid was coming out of the rear of the master cylinder and leaking into the
servo.  Is this normal?  I checked in the bently manual but couldnt find
anything either way.  I also filled the new master cylinder with brake fluid
to see if it leaked and it didnt seem to.  I know the servo works on vacume
pressure and though it was strange to have fluid inside it.  The level is
about 1 inch below where the hole for the master cylinder mounts to.  Any
ideas? or anyone run into this before?  Will the brake fuild damage the
servo?

Thanks
