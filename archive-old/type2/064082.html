Subject: Invisible Americans

To All:

Twice during the trip to Inuvik, Canadians expressed surprise at my
nationality, having assumed I was a fellow Canadian.  Several other times I
was mistaken for a fellow Canadian.  Since uploading articles covering the
first part of the journey I have received certain comments from Canadian
readers that indicate I am not a 'normal' American.  After pondering this
matter for some time I believe I see some of the reasons for my abnormality
and why I could have been mistaken as a Canadian, albeit momentarily.

a.  I am invariably polite to strangers, clerks and the like, using
honorifics such as 'sir' or 'ma'am.'    (Canadians tend to be more polite
than Americans.)

b.  On the trip I wore old, comfortable clothing, including lace-up boots and
suspenders.  (Americans tend to wear newer, more stylish clothing of a type
grossly impractical for the Canadian out-back.)  [As part of the 'survival
kit' carried on the trip, I had a tweed sport coat, wool slacks, a dress
shirt and silk tie, as well as suitable shoes, stockings and the like,
expensive, well-tailored clothing suitable for an appearance in court -- or a
good restaurant, but was never required to to appear in the former nor came
across the latter during the course of our journey.]

c.  My smile is filled with dental disasters.  (Americans tend to have
prettier teeth than Canadians.)

d.  I always paid with Canadian currency and did so without fumbling or
denigrating comment. ( ! )

Aside from the event already desribed, two others come to mind.  A clerk
expressed profound surprise that I was from San Diego:  &quot;You're from the
STATES?&quot;  (very surprised)  At my nod she insisted &quot;But you were BORN
here...&quot;   This happened in Fort Nelson and was vaguely linked to a shared
observation about logging trucks, polite waiting-for-my-change chit-chat that
I really can't recall.

Another incident occured at an RV store in Whitehorse where a lady and I were
waiting, not all that patiently, for a loud-mouthed elderly American to
finish making an ass of himself over some repair work he was required to pay
for, which he did in fine style. (I'll leave you to pharse the construction
there :-)  When he was done and safely out of earshot the lady offered:  &quot;One
really wonders about Americans...&quot;  I made some non-verbal sign of agreement
which was completely honest.  Most Americans spend a lot of time wondering
what's wrong with Americans.  Of mirrors, we have none.

In both of these cases I assume the people thought I was Canadian based on
factors mentioned above since I made no conscious effort to 'appear'
Canadian.  I am an American.  And proudly so.
