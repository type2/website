Subject: should I replace the pump?

------=_NextPart_001_0007_01C211FE.457BC5A0

I am trying to get all my camping equipment working properly.  =20
The circuit breaker for the outlet is faulty.
The sink pump keeps blowing fuses. =20
I was going to replace the pump, but before I did I just wanted to know i=
f there is nothing wrong with the pump and it is all because of the circu=
it breaker.
Thanks,
Kyle
