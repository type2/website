Subject: Weird Noises

My '81 started making a very strange noise today.  I drove it to Taco Time
for lunch (my first problem maybe?) and it was fine.  I went inside, ate,
and then when I got back in and started it the noise began.  I sounded
like an exhaust leak, kind of a metallic 'thunk thunk thunk' noise that
increased with engine speed.  I doubt that an exhaust leak would start up
instantly like that, so I figured maybe it's a stuck lifter?  Well, after
checking the oil, I added a quart (it needed a quart) and the noise was
still there.  I crawled under with it running and the noise was definately
on the passenger side, and louder above the heat exchanger than below.  

The funny thing is, the noise went a way after I drove a bit, which makes
me think it was related to the oil.  While I'm glad it's gone, I'd like to
know what it was so I can prevent it again.  

Thanks,
Craig
