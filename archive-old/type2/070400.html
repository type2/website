To put this bluntly, I have given very, very serious thought to getting a New 
Volkswagen, because I believe they are probably the best cars made today (which
isn't necessarily the great thing it should be...)

So, of course, I would like the Passat station wagon.  Naturally I would want the 
V6, with a 5-speed manual trans.  Anything less would be a detriment to fahrvergngyen,
even if the car is hecho in mejico.  I would prefer NOT to have power windows or door
locks, would definitely not want leather seats, a 6-cd changer or any of that stuff.
Well; if you do not know, it is not available.  What's VW thinking?  I have a 2 year
old, and what I really want is my father's oldsmobile.  You could fold the seats down
and have about 60 square feet in there!  

Okay.  So I look at the 4-door Jetta.  Same deal.  If you want VW's best engine, you
have to take it in a &quot;luxury&quot; car.  In fact, the Jetta is a very expensive car if you
want horsepower.  And if I didn't want horsepower, well, I already have a VW Transporter.

Okay, okay.  So I decided to give the dealer a chance anyway.  I just asked some 
questions that led to me finding out the information above, and tried to see if the
$22,000 price (for the wagon) was for real, and I said &quot;What if I gave you a $5,000
cash down payment, what could I expect to really pay?  Maybe $15,000 realistically?&quot;
Guess what?  He tried to get me interested in GTI's.  Guess who came to their senses
about buying a car, and perhaps as importantly, guess what car maker did not get $5,000
cash that day?

Now I don't expect my bus to be capable of being my only transportation, but on the same
note it isn't just a toy for me.  Maybe I'll find an 80-something Fox wagon (anybody in 
the south?) or (wonder of wonders) a squareback!! (what I really wanted in the first 
place and got my westy instead.  :-(     :-)
