Up here (Vancouver, Canada) it's car stereos or cell phones that tempt the
junkies.  I learned my lesson a few years back when I stopped for a short
while in my bashed-up 83 Nissan beater.  Came back to find over 500 bucks
worth of damage to door-locks, doors, and finally a smashed-in window:  all
for a stereo that (ha ha)  didn't work AT ALL!!

Nowadays, in my '79 Westy, I use a detachable face-plate Sony CD/radio.
But, just to make sure that the cross-eyed twits checking out the takings
get the message, I'm going to write &quot;NO RADIO&quot; in bright (maybe
luminescent?) paint, on the exposed underplate.

There's just no underestimating the stupidity of the truly desperate.
