Subject: Bus parts, freely exchanged
Message-Id: &lt;199905141305.GAA24609_at_helix.ucsd_dot_edu&gt;

I have received a number of replies to yesterday's message about 
exchanging parts. While reading them, I see that my thinking -- and my 
posting to the list -- were a bit muddle-headed. So this is a do-over.

I didn't have anything more in mind but to take the best spirit of the 
list and hold it up as an ideal, and to suggest some kind of a code that 
will help to sustain that spirit. I don't know anything about other 
countries, but I do know that in large parts of the United States people 
are generally confused about how to behave. Right in my own neighborhood, 
people drive 55 mph through school zones when the posted limit is 25 and 
kids are out on the sidewalks with bookbags on their backs. So what do 
you do? Go 55? Or slow down and feel like an idiot?

Here in the United States we need to be reminded that it's okay to obey 
the law. That neighborliness is alright. That greed, no matter what 
Michael Douglas said in a movie, is _not_ good. That you are not a 
schmuck if you turn the other cheek or walk the extra mile (and that you 
don't have to attach a fish symbol to your bus in order to believe that 
walking second miles or turning other cheeks is the right thing to do).

This rant was really motivated by two things. The first came when Steve 
Dolan asked us our opinions about o-boy postings. The second was the 
wonderful employment thread last week. I subscribe to all three lists, 
and what emerged out of the employment thread was a renewed sense that 
baywindow bus owners are a special breed: not too showy, not so much 
interested in appearances, not terribly materialistic. Just good people. 
Maybe you felt the same way.

Out of that I came away with a desire to fix a teeny pocket of the world. 
I thought it might be a good thing, an ethical thing, a desirable thing, 
to point out that we are at our best when we can set the matter of money 
aside. When we act as though our time isn't money but rather a gift that 
we wish to share freely. And so too with parts.

If that doesn't make sense, then think of it as a karma-samsara thing.

Anyway, what I had in mind was a sort of honor code for the list. Whether 
anyone follows it is up to them.

On the giving end:

1. If you have a part and someone says they need it, give it to them.

2. If you cannot afford to absorb the cost of postage, ask that they pay 
postage.

3. Do not ever throw a usable part away -- offer it to the list.

4. Do not stash away a part that you know you will never use -- offer it 
to the list (most of us are packrats, so this will take some soul searching).

5. Barter is preferable to outright sale.

6. If you need to be reimbursed for a part, come up with the lowest 
possible price to ask.

7. Don't try to &quot;come out ahead&quot; in exchanges of bus parts for bus parts, 
or bus parts for money unless all or part of your livelihood is devoted 
to providing bus parts for sale.


On the receiving end:

1. If you need a part, ask for it. If you have little or no money, say so.

2. Never take a part without reimbursement if you can afford to pay for it.

3. Always offer to pay postage. 

4. If you can, offer barter.

5. Since this is a community, you can repay one person's kindness by 
acting in kind toward another person.

6. Never ask for a part simply to create a stash. If you don't really 
need it, don't ask for it and don't take it.

7. In the case of a loan, always return a part in better condition than 
the condition in which you borrowed it.

So there it is. Many on the list already follow this code, but they don't 
think of it as a code -- it's just the right thing to do. To them, I 
apologizew for &quot;wasting bandwidth.&quot; But frankly, we can all endeavor to 
be better people.

Rant over,

Mark Hineline
