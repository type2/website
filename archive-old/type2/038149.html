&gt;I like this idea, but my wife will probably not go there.  I really need

If you put one right, you don't need a scrapyard as a home. Then both your
vehicle and your home will meet the wife's sence of aesthetics, and most of
your neighbors as well.

&gt;
&gt;something that gets better gas mileage for the daily commute.
&gt;
&gt;&gt;Citroen 2CV
&gt;
&gt;Damn!  I'd love to have one.  Not practical, though.

Cheese and rice, get a Bug, T-III, T-IV. Do one specification German parts
motor, fully balanced, for a third the cost of 5 or 7 loss leader
compromise infected semi-overhaul motors that would equal the life of the
straight factory motor, specifications met and enhanced.

Do everything else right on the car then operate and maintain it per
specification, and drive your cost per mile way down.  


&gt;
&gt;&gt;I suggest a Subaru.
&gt;
&gt;Definately a possibility.  Family resemblance to VWs a plus.  Reports of bad
&gt;engines for late 80s models a minus.  Anyone know more about this issue?
&gt;

Stay within the family of your T-II's, and you don't have to learn a whole
new philosophical system.

&gt;&gt; I have an '88 Nissan Stanza
&gt;

I don't know enough to know about the Stanza, but most of the 260Z-300ZX??
had Bosch F.I. licensed systems. Others of Datsun/Nissans had them. Not at
all dissimilar from the VW T-I &amp; II F.I. systems of the same and later era.
These Air Flow Meter systems work well and last long.

&gt;Like it!  I'm concerned about being able to work on it, though.  Can my mind
&gt;grok both Datsuns and VWs at the same time?  A good question.
&gt;

Again, do yourself a favor and stay within the family, unless by your
inquisative nature you enjoy solving new problems by putting time in new
knowledge of new viewpoint.

Did later 510's use the same engine as the 240 series, et al, or were they
only 4cyl. I say, stay within the VW family for best overall value. 

&gt;&gt;Squareback
&gt;
&gt;The perfect 2nd car?  Close!  If only I could find a nice one, pre-'68 for
&gt;cheap.

Since it costs a whole lot of money to make a nice one Factory Spec, they
are not cheap, they are simply not for sale. You must buy the most solid
rust free chassis you can find, then replace everything found out of spec.
Don't be afraid of the Manifold Pressure Controlled F.I. systems on the
T-III's of later vintage. Don't go with a carb model unless it has factory
carbs and linkage in good order. They are unobtainium. NO AFTERMARKET
CONVERSION will run as well as the stock setup in good order. You MIGHT be
able to bush the carb shafts to overcome their typical weakness in aged and
worn condition. 

You CAN get the MPC parts, and the system needs but a modicrum of
maintenance for VERY long life.
