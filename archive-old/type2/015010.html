No clue what they will charge you, but I've reinstalled that window myself
in a '71 Westy (identical in that respect to the '70) and it took me less
than an hour including all the prep work, a lot of contemplation and
re-reading the instructions several times. 

I'd expect it to take a professional less than 30 minutes *IF* they use the
proper technique. I did have to have my wife help me, but all she did was
put pressure on the outside of the window while I pulled the cord on the
inside (the cord that goes inside the new seal to pull it over the body lip.

The flat windows on buses are EASY to install as long as you use the proper
technique. Never installed a front windshield on a bay, so I can't comment
there.

Good luck! Joe
