&gt;Ok,
&gt;             Im confused.  I took a pic of where the throttle body was
&gt;removed from the intake air manifold.  Just so I know that I am not
&gt;making a stupid mistake..this is the throttle body right?

&gt;
&gt;And this is where it connects to the intake air manifold right?
&gt;http://www.wicals_dot_com/troy/vw/images/airleak/pages/DSC00166.htm
&gt;
&gt;This is where I am trying to figure out if a seal should be present or
&gt;not.  Cause there was nothing.  Thanks for helping me out.  Sorry I am
&gt;so green.
&gt;
&gt;
