&gt;One thing that irritates me is that when staying for a while in a
&gt;place it would be nice to get a library card and be able to check out
&gt;books. That priviledge usually requires a residence street address, which
&gt;may not be so easy to come up with. (Although people who are regulars
&gt;in a particular park can usually use that as a residence address.)

--&gt;  Some states offer a state-wide card, that's accepted at most
libraries in the state.  Michigan has (or had) something like this, though
it wasn't particularly well supported.

My question is, if you don't have a mail drop *somewhere*, how do you get
bills and such?  The people I know who have 'full-timed it,' as the RV
crowd puts it, always had their mail sent to a relative, but that's not
always convenient for either party.
