&gt; So they VW factory engineers recommended straight
&gt; weight SAE30 or SAE40 for summer and 15W40 for
&gt; winter.

As has been pointed out before, that recommendation was made in the Olde
Dayes, when multi-vis oils were not as good as they are now.

At operating temperatures, a SAE10W40 oil _is_ a SAE40 oil.  It is only at
low temperatures that the additional 10W specification comes into play.
In face a refiner could package SAE10W40 oil in SAE40 containers and sell
it as straight grade without violating the SAE standard!

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;For whatever
it's worth,
most piston-engine &gt; airplanes (think hot-running aircooled engines)
&gt; burn
&gt; single-weight oil, SAE 40 or 50, and *all*
&gt; multigrade oils sold for aircraft use are at
&gt; least semisynthetic.

Aircraft engine design predates even our venerable VWs, which is why they
use such high viscosity oils.  Aircraft owners
also do some rather exotic things, like employ electric or propane
pre-heaters to get their engines above ambient temperaturs on those really
cold mornings.  Aircraft engine know-how doesn't always transfer directly
to our VWs.

FWIW...
