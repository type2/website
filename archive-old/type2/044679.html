Subject: RE: [T2] Danish Veng

&gt; I recently heard that Veng, the Danish manufacturer of aftermarket body
&gt; panels and other stuff, went belly up.
&gt;
&gt; It's a shame to see a manufacturer go. Strangely enough their website is
&gt; still on the air (http://www.veng.dk/out/95/9555/parts.en.html for bus
&gt; parts). I also heard their remaining type-2 inventory has been bought by
&gt; Alan Schofield in England and the molds were bought by someone else. Does
&gt; anyone know more about this? Ron, is this the same company you refer to as
&gt; 'Dansh' (like in heat exchangers).
&gt;
&gt; I fear this means loss of a source of good quality parts and possibly a
&gt; price increase of what's still available.


Actually, Veng went bankrupt roughly six months ago.  I got advance word of
it, and ordered a container load of sheet metal just in time, right before
it happened.  Still, there was, and is, a shortage of certain Bus and
Vanagon sheet metal parts (principally part numbers that they were already
out of stock on at the time of their bankruptcy).

If I'm not mistaken, it was not Shofield who purchased most of the remaining
VW inventory, but another company (who may have in turn supplied Schofield).
Another company bought the tooling, and supposedly is (or will be) resuming
manufacture of Volkswagen sheet metal.  (Veng made sheet metal for many
makes and models, of which Volkswagen was just one.) I believe that they are
already shipping some VW sheet metal, although perhaps not for busses. As I
understand it, there was some sort of relationship between Veng and this
other company (whose name I forget) prior to the bankruptcy; they supplied,
or distributed for, or somehow worked with Veng already.

Many U.S. Veng distributors did not find out about the bankruptcy until
after I did.  I know that in some cases, they thought their orders were en
route, when in fact they had never even shipped due to the  bankruptcy.
This has led to shortages in the U.S., which may continue until the new
owners get everything fully running again.   I have pretty good stock on
most Veng for now, since I stocked up right before it happened.  Regarding
your mention of possible price increases, I have no plans to raise my prices
even if availability gets tight (although of course I may sell out
completely on some items). Hovever I'm sure that there will be some
suppliers who do indeed use this as an excuse to raise prices.  If we're
really lucky, by the time most parts have sold out, the new manufacturer
will have everything back in the pipeline anyway.

The Danish exhaust parts I sell are from a different company, Jopex, who
also sells under the Dansk name and has no relationship to Veng.
