    The tradition of doing immaculate, sanitary, meticulously detail
    oriented vehicle restoration is also a grand one. Problem is,
    the logical conclusion of that path is a vehicle that is far
    too valuable and primo to subject to the slings and darts of
    outrageous fortune on the streets and actually DRIVE anywhere.
    Much less go CAMPING in one. I assert that if you really want
    to continue using your bus, you can't do an all out restoration.

I'm pretty stock because 
 (1) I'm obsessively fearful of rust and that's where most of my
     money goes (having lost 2 squarebacks and a beetle to FeOx)
 (2) I'm no mechanical genius
 (3) I do all my work outdoors on a city street
 (4) The few remaining mechanics I can find breathe stock air
 (5) I liked the bus just the way it was
 (6) My family is embarassed enough as it is

Boring, huh?  (The Red Cross likes my blood because
I'm boring, so it ain't all bad.)
