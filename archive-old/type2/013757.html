&gt;One wonder I do have in rebuilding is that the inner and outer surfaces on
&gt;the hub and the castle nut are badly deformed.  I am thinking of taking
&gt;them to a machinist and seeing if they can be ground flat.  Any reason not
&gt;to?  I don't see the dimension as being critical element.

I think all those cursed rear hub parts on that van should be thrown
away.  Steve didn't exactly mention in his need to replace bearings
that I think I've seen him retighten the 46mm on that '80 at least 3
times.  Which is 3 times more than I've ever touched that nut on any
van in my live except to pull a rear drum I can't get off a Vanagon.
(Which is actually how I've taken to pulling the rear drums on Vanagons
about all the time as I get scared beating on them cause of what else?
Worries about impact on those rear bearings I never ever want to see
in my lifetime 8-)  I doubt either of these parts was hardened, I also doubt
it is worth doing as unless you are buying your rear stubs new from
RMMW they don't cost much.  In fact once again, THE FREE '81 COMES
WITH REAR SPINDLES, STUBS, ETC. (no brakes though unless I
find them.)  And the '87 stuff is available as well.

Regardless that '80 of his has been cursed in the rear all along.  Maybe
since he ran the MSHP Stage2 in it, but it saw some pretty good time
in my '82 and I don't have any problems..... yet.....
