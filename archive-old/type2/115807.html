&gt; I've got spark and

&gt; pump and nothing.  The pump gets warm to the touch after a short period of
&gt; cranking and I've tried tapping it with a piece of wood.  Still no flow.
&gt; Anyone have any ideas before I spend the $150 for a new pump.

First prove that you are getting fuel from gas tank by disconnecting the
inlet side of the pump. The pump is lubricated by fuel flowing through the
mechanism so don't ruin a good pump by running it dry.

If your gas lines to the pump are clogged then you've got to deal with that.
I often pick up FI pumps at the junkyard for $6-10. I don't know if that's
lucky or not but it's been my experience.
