Subject: Re: where not to go to get your front end alignment.

ive tried toe in, and never had any luck with it myself. i feel like its a
job left to the folx w/ computors. I usually start looking for coupons about
a week before i replace my tie rod ends. my letest tie rod fiasco had a lot
more to do with the parts manufactuor.

it goes something like this:
Buy two tie rod ends, one left and one right hand threaded.
take off old tie rod ends.
find out that the right handed tie rod box contains a left hand threaded tie
rod end.
go back to the store (in the girlfriends car, as mine has no tie rod on the
passenger side)
get another tie rod end. check at the shop to MAKE SURE its reall right hand
threaded.

Go bak home. tie rod end wont thread.

Go back to store....girlfriend getting annoyed.

it turns out that the mold for the thread must have been old, the channel
isnt a nice sharp V but rather a U. The very nice folks at NW foreign auto
apologize and rethread the damn thing. They say im not the first person to
have this problem. 

Take home. now these arent like the old style with cotter pins, but they have
a flange to the mounting bolt, and your supposed to tighten it up against the
frame. Uneforetunatly its also a &quot;universal&quot; part ment to fit and astonishing
array of vws. Some one who designed the part forgot that the plafce where the
little bugger mounts is thinner on my car then later ones, so it locks with
about 1cm of up and down freeplay. Acht!
Unbolt, use steel washer and lock washer. FINALLY! right?

Wrong, go to get it aligned and find out that the front tires have
delaminating ply...there egg shaped in other words. the care sat on those
tires for five yr=ears and Ive put 20K miles on them._dot_cant complain...go and
get used tires (im running out of bread at this point) back to the ZGoodyear
alignment center (the ones I was at were really nice, they were very
understanding and made an appointment for me for the same day.) fet aligned.
And we went along happily until the cadilllac...but ive already told that
story.

The moral: take the tie rod with you. get OEM spec parts if you can, and
avoid any part thats supposed to fit 68-83 VW vans!
