With the volume it takes too long, so it's UNSUBSCRIBE for now. Back soon.&quot;


Duane,
I've never used hotmail so I've never experienced this problem, but I have
used Yahoo!mail with some satisfaction.

Another thing you may want to consider is receiving the list messages as a
digest.  This is one or two messages a day with a slight delay.

Oh one more thing! You can check list messages on the web here:
