Just a note to let you know that my shipment from Europe arrived at the shop
Friday, and your orders will ship Monday or Tuesday.

I am about to close the advance window of opportunity that I gave list
members, and promote these parts to the general public.  You still have a
couple of days still to get them before anyone else gets a shot at them.
The list is at http://www.busdepot_dot_com/members.htm  .  It's worth a look.

I will probably announce the parts to the general public tomorrow or
Tuesday.  At the same time, I will be raising the price on a handful of the
parts, since the initial pricing was intended for list members only.  I will
honor the list member pricing (as seen on the above page) for all of this
upcoming week.  Even if it comes up higher on the shopping cart, you will
get the list member price **IF** you specify in the instructions field that
you are a list member.  However, availability will be limited to stock on
hand, of course.  After next week, the pricing on the web will apply, which
may be slightly higher on some items.  (Of course even that pricing is far
lower than anybody else has these items, I assure you.)

One unfortunate note:  The crate of unidentified splitty and Syncro parts,
which I had mentioned was supposed to be included in the shipment, wasn't
there.  Apparantly it was not sent due to Customs problems with sending a
crate where every item was not identified.  As a result, I may not get that
crate until my next European delivery in late January or early February.

Thanks,
Ron Salmon
