Subject: Wanted:Fuel/air gauge

I have bought two fuel/air gauges from CB Performance. First the more
expensive 3wire which would not work and then the cheaper one wire that
won't work either. I followed the instructions to the letter. The only
difference is that I &quot;C&quot; clamped the sensor to a vice grip which I inserted 
in my tail pipe. I drove 20min on the freeway today and the meter did one
swing to 12 then went back to rest on 17 and stayed there. I have a good
ground 
wire and I've tested the meter for power. 

Soooo...does anyone have an idea where I can get a good fuel/air meter?
Or maybe some idea as to what I might be doing wrong.

Martin
