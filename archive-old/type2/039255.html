Subject: Distributor options for 1972 bus(stock 1700 motor)

Ok folks, my first post musta have missed the mark in a major way so I will
try again.

I am not happy with the 009 dizzy on the 1972 Westfakia. I am considering
the following options.

Restore my original vac/mechanical stock dizzy and try to hook it up to the
vac port on the Weber 32/36 progressive(pinto) carb and the vac port on the
manifold. Sounds like fun but I will prolly screw the rebuild up :)

Buy a rebuilt correct '72 only dizzy from www.busdepot_dot_com  ( They swear
they can get it!) Hook it up as listed above.

Go with an 010 mechanical advance only. Perhaps a hair better then 009 but
cant seem to find anyone that actually runs one just people that sell them.

Do the www.aircooled_dot_net SVDA dizzy that has been spoken of as of late.
Reading through his tech pages leads me to beleive that this is not the
correct carb for the 1700 type4 motor and the 010 works better for my
application.

And now for the wild card. I was thinking of pulling the dizzy off the
totally original 1969 single port motor left over from the wrecked bus. The
dizzy works just fine as of my last check. The question is since it is a vac
advance dizzy only with it get along with the weber and the 1700 motor?

Feedback is welcome!
