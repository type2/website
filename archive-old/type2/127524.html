&gt; I think. Ohms measure resistance in the wires, the
&gt; voltage would be a true 
&gt; indicator if there was power coming through the non
&gt; resistant wires. I am 
&gt; pretty sure that is how it works but I am no

     Okay I checked all wires for volts, I get 12
volts coming through the black w/white stripe power
wire. I also am getting 9 volts in the brown ground
wires, Is this normal? I didn't think you would have
any power coming through your ground. All other wires
doesn't have power coming through. I also found a used
relay, and it does the same thing, so it can't be the
relay. 
Thanks,
