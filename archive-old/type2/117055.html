Subject: Window Sealant Questions

&quot;I'm getting ready to put all the windows back in the bus and I'm trying to

decide what, if anything, to seal things up with.&quot;

IMHO Nothing, factory did not use anything, and as long as you have good
seals you shouldn't need anything.

&quot;So what is the best?  What would seal the best, keep the rust away, not
hurt
my not-so-cheap paint job, last the longest....&quot;

&quot;Seems to me like the Window Weld Sealer 08606.&quot;

Probably pretty good stuff. I've always been a big 3M fan.

&quot;And finally what would one use to clean up the excess sealant? Something
paint freindly.&quot;

Not certain but this type of stuff usually cleans up with denatured alcohol
which is paint safe, check the tube.

But if it were me I would not use anything unless you found that they
leaked, then i would find out why and only use the sealant as a last
resort. These glues can be great but who knows what they will be like in 15
years...
