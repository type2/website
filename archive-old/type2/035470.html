Subject: Where did they all come from?

Just in the past few weeks in my neighborhood (San Francisco, Mission district,
21st &amp; Treat), I've noticed LOTS of Busses around...

Within two blocks of my house, there is:
an early 80's Silver Vanagon Westfalia (Very nice)
a 76-79 Green Baywindow Westy (Exceptionally nice)
two 68-71 Busses, one of which is a Westy, the other a Station wagon with a
home-built roof rack (diamonds in the rough)
and a late Split-Window (Lowered, very nice)

And there's too many to list further out.

I feel as though I live in Type II Central..... Wondering if any of you are on
this list???

(I've got the Brown/White '78 Westy. I'm usually doing something to it on
Saturdays, stop by!)
