Subject: RE: [T2] Taco grief

Alan,

Did you replace the o-ring? If not, did you accidentally pinch the existing
o-ring? Better drain the oil and check it. If it is damaged it needs to be
replaced. There is too much crankcase oil pressure to withstand the leak if
the seal was damaged during removal.

Hi,



When I was trying to remove my oil screen to check it, I removed a plate
that had 10 mm bolts holding it on.



It has an orange O ring on it. I was told it is called a taco plate.



I put it back on after cleaning it up. I used reasonable torque to tighten
it, such as snug but not tight, using a 10 mm screw driver.



I cleaned and replaced the gaskets for the screen just fine.



Now when I run the engine I am losing about &lt; Liter of oil per day.



I can see it dripping.



Does anyone have a suggestions to guide me on the course to fixing this?



I was hoping to be doing push rod tubes or something by now.



My first thought is it could be bent, or something is blocking the seal of
the gasket.



One way or another, I guess all the oil is coming out on my face. ;-:





Cheers,



Alan
