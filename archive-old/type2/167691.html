&gt; As I recall, the electrical portion is removable from underneath
&gt; with one screw.

I hope your right, the switch works correctly but sometimes the start
position doesn't engage the starter, but if I push up on the wires it
works so I suspect, hope, it is only the electric part. might even be
a loose plug but gotta turn inside out upside down to get in there and
see what is what.

&gt; &gt; is it possible to replace just the electric part without
&gt; &gt; tearing the whole thing apart...
