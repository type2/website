Well, is IS out of whack, and I'm not sure it's us discount shoppers that
started it!
When the dealers price is 4 to 5 times what the exact same part (sometimes even
with VW-audi logos on it!) as what we can get it for in the automotive
aftermarket, local VW dealers end up looking quite greedy.
Who's really at fault is probably VWOA, and they probably should hear about it.

I believe that GM reacted to Taiwanese body parts competetion several years ago
with some downward price adjustments, perhaps to increase public opinion. (I
can't believe they did it because they neede the business!)
So, I think it wouldn't hurt for us to complain to VWOA, en mass, but don't
count on it helping, but it couldn't hurt.
And I think Marshall (my local VW parts man) is enough of a realist to realise
that on many parts, he just cannot compete.
And I agree that you need to let him make some money once in a while, but the
dealer here does not seem to be hurting.
