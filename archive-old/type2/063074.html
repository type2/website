Subject: missing digests 152-163

Volks!

        Is there a gopher for type2-list archives?  For some reason, I was
unsubscribed for a couple of days without my knowledge, and I'm now missing
the above digests.  If there is no gopher, would someone be kind enough to
forward what they can to me?  Many thanks, since I'm depending on these
digests to keep me informed about how to care for and fix my new bus.  
        On another note, for those in the New England area the weekend of
the 15th,  I just heard about a 3 day bus gathering called 'Busses by the
Bouy'.  There were about 100 buses last year from what I was told, so it
should be alot of fun.  Hopefully, I will have Molly limping along by then
enough to spend the weekend there.
        The caravan will leave the 3 mile pond rest area along route 3,
between Augusta, Maine, and Searsport, around 9:00am, arriving at the
'Searsport Shores Campground' (207-548-6059 for info - $15/night, I think)
between 10:00-10:30am.  During the 3 days, there will be a hike, possibly
sea kayaks available (deposit required), a cruise to Holbrook Island aboard
the &quot;Balmy Days&quot; ($16.00/ person fee), lobster cookout (also deposit
required), flea markets to shop at, a campfire on the beach, and, on sunday,
another caravan to Verona Island topped with a picnic at Fort Knox (bring a
flashlight to explore the fort).  For more complete info and a map sent to
you call Jaci Hart (207)563-1288.  Sorry about the short notice, but I just
found out the other day myself.  Hope some of you can come!
                                                        --Eric
