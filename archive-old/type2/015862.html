&gt;I have a 1980 Vanagon air cooled Westy. I installed a Stewart Warner oil

&gt;quality guage? I would appreciate hearing from others as to their average

&gt;sending unit in a good place to represent the actual oil temp? 

This would be a good question to research in the archives at
http://www.type2_dot_com.

I consider VDO to be a good quality gauge - that's what I run.  I am
comfortable with 230, wary with 250, and disturbed by 270 - in fact I think
I would pull over before I let it get that high.  All this with good
synthetic oil - I wouldn't go as high with non-synthetics.
