Ok, I know others have done this job; but I'm not sure just how big a
job it is, or if it makes economic sense (time and/or money) to do on a
bay window bus (the only kind I love, to be sure, but they're not
exactly rare or expensive).

Situation: Two, count'em, two more or less solid straight late model
Westfalias with bashed in noses, in one case with the nose pushed in
badly enough so that the dash is bowed slightly, and in the other case
so badly that the windshield sill is pushed in.  In the latter case, a
complete face replacement is doubtless necessary; but it has occurred to
me that it might be easiest/best to do the lesser damaged one the same
way, namely, to graft a whole face (from below that big seam just above
the bumper to above the windshield, where the seam would be hidden by
the luggage rack.

Does anyone have experience with this kind of repair?  Tips?
Speculative thoughts?

Could someone with a little Millermatic 130XP, air cut-off tool,
grinder, air hammer etc. do the job?  How much should one expect to pay
somebody else to do a job like this?
