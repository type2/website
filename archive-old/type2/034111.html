Subject: 78 van in SF -- NYTimes homeless article

Main homeless caveat: &quot;Don't get involved.&quot;

Main VW caveat: &quot;Help when you can.&quot;

Hmm... from the photo, the van looks intact... depends what's lurking
under the surface, valves/points/condensor shouldn't be a problem, air
filter/mysterious 20-year-old rust/FI ailments would be another story,
eh..? New plugs could only help... the battery is probably 20 years old,
too... anybody in SF that can locate these folks?

Valve adjust
Plugs
Plug wires
Points
Condensor
Battery? at least a charge?
Battery ground?
Air filter?
Oil and filter?
