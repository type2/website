Subject: Stroke a 1600 with stock carb and p&amp;c? 

I have no immediate need for an engine, but would
like to think it through very well and get advise
from the experts well before I need it.  

My goal is reliability first and grab any &quot;free&quot;
power, torque over horsepower, that I can without
giving up reliability.  With that in mind, I'm
thinking of the following:

1.  I will maintain stock induction (34 carb) in
part for simplicity and in part due to possible
emissions requirements.  I guess if the emissions
guys are really on the ball, I'll have to go to a
30.  I expect to have to go to larger jets, of
course.  

2.  I will maintain stock P&amp;C, because I'm not
big on the thinner walled cylinders.  It gets
really hot in southern Arizona.  I also like
being able to buy new heads and P&amp;C off the shelf
if necessary, so that I can do roadside repairs
for valve problems, etc without ordering special
heads or P&amp;C's.  Not many machine shops in
Mexico.  

3.  I will buy a counterweighted crank and
balance the engine completely.  

4.  Cam will be stock or very moderate, with
torque being the goal.  

However, I am a little interested in stroking the
engine.  I figure that I will not being doing any
roadside repairs that include cracking the case.
 
Is this a good idea?  What size crank?  I wonder
if the engine would be able to benefit from a
stroker given the small 34 carb.  However, I
notice that many small Jap truck and car engines
of the 70s and 80s had small carbs like this.  

Anyone build anything like this?  


Happy bussin'
