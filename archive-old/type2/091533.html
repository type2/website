Subject: Re: [T2] Sparkplug stuck please help

(1st off .... Make sure the engine is totally cold.
You want the spark plugs and engine block to be the same temperature.)

Bob I agree with your suggestion. I have the 

same problem with 3 and 4 cylinders, and I was

told the same procedure that you describe. I was

also told champion plugs are the worst because 

of course threads. Bosch only! How about this 

suggestion, a kid that used to work at a VW shop

said run the motor until hot and then try. Really 

goes against every thing I have ever heard! Hmm

when I get the guts I'll try the cold back out and 

forth method.
