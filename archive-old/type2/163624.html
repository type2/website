Subject: Re: [T2] paint color on westy propane tank

Would that grey for the tank be the same as the grey of the fuel injection  
manifold tubes that go to the plenunm?
 
And I think I have seen some engine top access hatches that color  too.
 
Is that Dove Grey maybe?
 
Or am I crazy?
 
Just curious.
