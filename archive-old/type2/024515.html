&gt; We need to replace the clutch in our '72 Bus.  It slips
&gt; after it gets hot, but otherwise is fine.  We have a parts
&gt; '72 Bus, but it appears to have a Type IV car engine, not a
&gt; proper Bus engine.  Would the clutches and pressure plates
&gt; be the same between these two engines?
&gt;
&gt; Thanks

Dave, check the engine code on the block of the type 4 motor you have. I've had a code 'W'
1971 411 Fuel injected case in my 73 bus that was converted to carburator and the clutch
equipment appeared to be the same as for a 1700 bus engine. I think the main difference between the
two 1700s was the horsepower and compression ratio - the 411 had a good amount of horsepower.
