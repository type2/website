Subject: [T2] Who is the originator of this drawing

I am setting up a new website specifically for the &quot;would-be rustorator&quot;.
Sorry, most of it is in Dutch although I plan to translate selected portions
of it. My 6 year old daughter suggested I include a 'kids section'. Well, no
father could resist so I did. See
http://www.rustbuster.nl/Rustbuster_for_kids.htm

Now the question: I used a drawing that I 'found' somewhere but I don't know
the origin of it. If anyone knows please tell me so I can ask the author for
permission.

Have fun,

Jan W Brier
