Hello all:
In a post yesterday, somebody was singing the praises of a product called 
&quot;CLR&quot; for removing rust. The post said you have to be patient, but it works 
wonders.

Well, I rushed right over to my local Walgreens and picked up a bottle. 
(Funny, it doesn't mention anything about rust on the label, but I assume 
that's what the &quot;R&quot; stands for.) Sprayed it on some rust on the old bus 
(where the windshield seal used to be) and...it foamed up and didn't do much 
else. Now yesterday's post did say to be patient, so I went to bed dreaming 
of clean shiny metal. Woke up this morning and...greeted by some thick, 
scummy white deposits sitting on top of the rust. Is there another kind of 
CLR out there? The bottle I bought is heavy on bathroom cleaner hype--smells 
nice too. Anything designed to tackle rust should give the impression of 
extreme toxicity, IMHO.
