Subject: There's always more to the story...

So after putting everything together on the GWB, and battling the
differences between my old head and the new one I got from Troy, I'm ready
to fire it up. Finally.

I add oil and run the starter for a few seconds to make sure there's oil
everywhere.

Then I fire it up. ClugclugclugBAMclugclugclugBAM. Like it's running on 2
cylinders.

Ok, Don, stop, smoke a cigarette and return to the bus after clearing the
mind. D'oh! I forgot to adjust the valves! Ones on the new head were all
tight except #1 intake ... heh

So after a valve adjustment everything seems pretty good. Fired right up,
idled nice, all-in-all I'm pleased. Some smoke coming from the 1/2 exhaust.
Not oil. So I reset the volume screws to 2 1/2 turns and it gets a little
better, though not much. I think I need to tear the right carb down. Sigh.
But it feels good from the driver's seat so I'll run it for now. Especially
since...

I drove the Volvo over to Troy's yesterday to finish the bus, and when I was
done I drove the Volvo home to pick up the wife and go back and get the bus.


Well, almost home. 2 blocks away from home the battery dies on the Volvo.
WTF? I just replaced the alt! Grr... Push the heavy beast out of the street
and over to a small side street and walk home.

It's still there and my bus is still at Troy's. I can't seem to win anymore.
