GOt a question for the engineers on the list.  will the integrity of my
bus be ruined if i cut out the pass reaar corner on my bus without somehow
bracing it?  i.e. will the bus flex so as to make it difficult to fit the
new corner? this is on a 78 westy removing the entire corner piece and
battery tray
thanks in advance
jamie
