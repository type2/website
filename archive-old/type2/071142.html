I pulled my upright motor out last night but it didn't exactly get it all the 
way out here's why. The previous owner had the rear piece of the bus bondoed 
on so i had to put the bus on ramps in order to get it high enough to drop 
the motor under the rear no problem right? Well being the poor planner i am i 
didn't use a large enough floor jack and had to put a wooden box in between 
the jack and the motor of course now the fan shroud still doesn't clear the 
rear end. Well i thought that's o.k. i'm just replacing the squeeky throw out 
bearing. Having done so the motor happened to fall off the box and is now 
wedged. What i'm wondering is how to get the motor back in without spending 
100 bucks on a good floor jack like i should have had in the first place, 
there's always next time. Any input or ideas appreciated.
