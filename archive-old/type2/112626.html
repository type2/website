Subject: R: [T2] Banned in the EU

&gt; I've put my money where my mouth is and scrapped my previous 
&gt; bus after 6 years
&gt; of rolling resto (estimate #8000/$12000USA spent), including 
&gt; having just
&gt; replaced the interior (and slept in it for one night) due to a major
&gt; structural defect coming to light. Dangerous vehicles belong 
&gt; in the scrap yard
&gt; (or a museum) not on the road.

Woah! This is wrong! It's probably right about putting a vehicle off the
road temporarily, but banning and confiscating the plate!!! That's too much.
After I read about the Zebra safari experience I have avoided Germany for my
trips with the bus; I say Germany it's &quot;unsafe&quot; for it.
We obviously have a different conception of what an &quot;unsafe&quot; vehicle is...
surely a 240+ kph mercedes qualifies against a 90 kph bus...?

I don't have such money to spend in the bus, but slowly I do what I can. I
cannot afford to fix the bus fully to fit germany's standard and surely I
cannot let it sit for years until it's ready

Police officiers here in the UE seldom do the right thing... more often do
the most convenient for them.
