Subject: Jalousies Windows for a Vanagon

I have been looking at the &quot;Jalousie Windows for a Vanagon 
Article&quot; at:

http://www.everybus_dot_com/dworkin/vgon_jalousie/

and would like to undertake the project. Has anyone ever 
tried this? I have a few questions...

1) I am assuming that the 1 5/8 radiuses be cut in all four 
corners of both sides (inside and outside of the window) is 
this right?

2) Is there a reason why the 1 5/8 radiuses cannot be cut 
prior to assembly?

3) Could't the inside window stock be done from a 42 3/8&quot; x 
16 11/16&quot; with a hole cut, and similarly the outside window 
stock be done from a 42 3/8&quot; x 16 3/4&quot; with a hole cut (using 
the strip widths as a guide for the hole size). Having them 
one piece would increase materials cost, but wouldn't it be 
stronger?

4) Why is there a 1/16&quot; inch difference between the height of 
the inside and outside window stock? Is it flush on the top 
or bottom and the 1/16&quot; stick out on another side or is there 
an extra 1/32&quot; on top and bottom? 

Thanks,
Chris
