&gt;I have replaced the master cylinder that was leaking and bled the brake
&gt;lines. However, the brakes act as they did before. When I apply the brakes
&gt;the pedal gives and feels spongy when I press it again the pedal is higher
&gt;and feels solid.
&gt;When I bled the brakes the fluid was dark and I bled them until I got clear
&gt;fluid. Do I need to bleed them more? What else could cause the soft pedal?
&gt;Pads and shoes are not worn. The only thing that is out of wack is the
&gt;parking brake which will not hold even though I have adjusted it to the
&gt;fullest extent. Could this be allowing the rear shoes to return too far?

Yes!  I think you hit on the answer.  Try this - pull the parking brake out
until it starts to drag (if it does at all) and then let it back in one or
two notches.  Then drive around and try your pedal test.  I bet your soft
pedal will be gone (mine was).  Only took me ten years to figure out that
the parking brake has a great deal to do with pedal feel.
