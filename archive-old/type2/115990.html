Subject: Re: [T2] Electronic ignition - opinions sought

&gt; I am not so sure about the Compufire myself but I have a Citroen mechanic
&gt; friend who swears by the Allison or Crane systems. He says that the pick up
&gt; and units as a whole are much more solidly built than the pertonix units. I
&gt; think the sensor, wiring, and control box are much more heavy duty on these
&gt; units, but they are a bit more expensive. YMMV

the crane/allison unit is excellent. they make two, the xr700 and the
xr3000. the xr700 is all you need. i have the xr700 unit in my mallory in
the westy, i had it in my stock bosch before installing the mallory.

the only slight drawback is that these units use an amplifier in addition to
the trigger inside the distributor, so there is one more component (and
associated wiring) to fail than with the pertronix or compufire. this is
more of a theoretical problem however, as i have never seen an amplifier
fail. they are also guaranteed for life by crane.

all in all, the crane/allison optical ignition is pretty much bulletproof
and very accurate.
