Subject: Re: [T2] VW Bus Manuals

HMF STOERMER sends:

&gt; The rep. had a broad array of their VW-specific publications there,
&gt; including some of their CD-ROMS of repair manuals.  Apparently they intend
&gt; to publish the CD-ROMS for most [maybe all] of their traditional manuals.

Please, please, PLEASE tell me this Bentley CD-ROM line is going to be
cross-platform!
