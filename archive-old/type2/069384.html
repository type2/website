So Jack Stafford says:
&gt; Good grief, all this chat about the lazy man's way to fix a flat!
&gt; I say just carry two spare tires and a bike pump just in case.

Ah, but Jack my man!  You're forgetting or missed the original intent
of this thread.  It was about having to deflat/reinflate tires while
traveling through snow....   So changing one tire won't do you any good
here!   :)
