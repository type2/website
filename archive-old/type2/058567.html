Subject: Engine swap ????: Will a 79 motor fit into a 73

I have a 73 Westy with a bad motor.  I have access to a 79 motor, 
complete with all FI equipment.

Q1:  Will the 79 motor bolt into a 73 van w/o any mods?

Q2:  Should I install the 79 FI equipment in the 73?

Q3:  Will the 73 dual carbs bolt onto the 79 motor?

To do the FI swap I know I'll have to put in the new fuel pump, new fuel 
tank, the brain and the rest of the FI equipment. Am I missing 
anything???

Thanks

John.
