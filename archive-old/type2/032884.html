Subject: VDO wiring diagram

the gauges in my bus are all whacked - whoever wired them up must have been
on crack or something, because they do some very strange things. for
instance: when the headlights are on and you adjust the dashboard light
dimmer switch, the tachometer needle goes dead. the tach has no light.
ever. the oil temp gauge has about 10 times more light than the rest of the
gauges, but the gauge itself doesn't want to work. all gauge lights are so
dark as to be useless, even on the darkest of nights with no streetlights
around.

so, i'm looking for wiring diagrams or installation instructions for the
following:

[All are VDO]
-tachometer
-oil pressure
-oil temp [drain plug style]


if someone has these around from an install of these gauges, and wouldn't
mind scanning them or snail-mailing me a copy, i'd really appreciate it.
i'd like to know how these things are *supposed* to be hooked up.
