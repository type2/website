Parts for sale. More parts than you can shake a stick at. :-)
http://home.earthlink_dot_net/~shrike3/parts/nixyard.html

Freebies this week:

Baywindow stuff:
1 left mirror glass with a convex mirror in lower right corner
1 engine hatch lock, no key (easily rekeyed, look in the Faq-o-Matic)
1 72-79 rear lens, red/amber/white (intact; has some cracks)
8 fresh air vents for the dash (need spongy backing)
2 back plates for front side markers
3 distributor springs

Obscure item: I've got two interior heat ducts, that fit in the heat hole
in the cabin floor and bolt under the middle seat of the passenger bus.
They redirect heat to rear passengers. Here's what they look like:

What are they worth?

I can do searches. Smaller than bumpers and grilles, please! :-) Let me
know what you need; we can discuss terms. I'm on a first-name basis with
the folks at the junkyard these days. :-) Shipping from Southern California.

Nikki
