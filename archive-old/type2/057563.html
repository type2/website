Subject: Re: Cooling an AC VW engine(Kind of long)

&gt;   Well, in the first place I'm talking about &quot;in general&quot; --- *ALL* VW
&gt;engines have oil temps far too hot. Brand new, stone stock -- the oil
&gt;temp is going to be over 200 on long runs and that destroys the oil.

Where did this info come from, that oil temps above 200 F destroy the
oil?  I think EVERY car, air-cooled or water-cooled, gets its oil temp.
over 200 degrees.  Of course the oil will &quot;wear out&quot; eventually, which
is why it needs replacing every so often.  If this is a real concern for
you, I would suggest synthetic oil.  I just can't imagine any engine,
especially those water-cooled engines without oil coolers, keeping the
oil under 200 degrees F on a regular basis.
