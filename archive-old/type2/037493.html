Subject: My front beam, and A.C. parts.

Hey.

    I got a front beam for 300 bucks.  It came with the torsion arms in
place and really only needs shocks, the sway bar, and the brakes.  It
was available, so I got it.

    Here's  a fun bit of info, though.  If your bus has stock air
conditioning, you have to evacuate the system before you take your front
beam out.  Lucky for me, there wasn't any R-12 left.  But the point is,
I took out a couple of hoses, and what might be called the evaporator on
a normal car.  It's a small radiator looking thing north of the front
beam.  It was in a wonderful spot, where the little barbs on the wire
mesh cover catch your flesh with every turn of the screwdriver while
taking the brake servo breather off.

    So, I have that out.  I'm thinking, if someone wants, I'd trade some
parts for my A.C. parts.  I don't know that they work, but the condenser
deals aren't banged up or anything.  I don't know how the condenser
comes out.  I have that too, though.  The lines are most likely bad, but
you can have those, if you want.  The only thing I really don't want to
have to take out is the under the dash control and duct work.  If you
really want that, you'll have to offer me something extra special.

    I'm looking for a glove box.  No one seems to make them aftermarket,
in my experience.  Also, the westy swing table, with &quot;L&quot; shaped post.  A
heater would be extra nice, preferably not one that kills people.  And a
Blumenvasen.  I've always wanted one with a yellow rose on it.

    ok.  It's a 77 Westy.  Pmail with any questions.

    Thanks.
