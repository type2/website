Subject: Re: [T2] Re: [VB] tranny drain plug trick

I have used the same trick in the past but finally went to my local NAPA and
bought the 17 mm hex wrench (not socket). It cost about 5 bucks. The bolt
trick works but can be a PITA sometimes.

&gt; Don,
&gt;
&gt; I've used the same system for my drain plug after looking all over town
for
&gt; a hex-head socket. I can't take credit for inventing it though, while
&gt; looking for a socket to fit, I took a 17mm hex bolt to a hardware store
and
&gt; told the guy &quot;this fits perfectly&quot; he went over to the metric nut bins and
&gt; took out two, screwed them on to the bolt and said &quot;here's your answer.&quot; I
&gt; looked at it for a couple of seconds and then the lights went on. Not only
&gt; is it effective, it cost a fraction of what a wrench or socket would.

&gt;
&gt;
&gt; For $1.16 I made a little tool today to get the drain and fill plugs out
of
&gt; my '65
&gt;
&gt; 1 - 3&quot; Automotive bolt with a 17mm head
&gt; 2  17mm nuts
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; The two nuts lock each other, so vise grips on the bottom one loosens, on
&gt; the top
&gt; one, tightens
&gt; Not one flaps, or even VW dealer even knew what I was talking about
&gt; when I asked about a 3/8 17mm hex socket.  The Foriegn Flaps guy said
&gt; &quot;you'll never find anything like that out here&quot; (CT).  So I made this
little
&gt; thing and it's worked good so far. Will still order the socket from
someone
&gt; for safe re-tightening
&gt;
&gt; Just thought I'd share my small triumph
&gt;
