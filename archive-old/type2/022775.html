Sorry for inadvertnly getting the AAA thread started!!

I split the case last night expecting to find a broken cam--or worse.

What did I find?  The heads look great with no apparent cracks and no burned
valves. The main bearings that I can see (didn't have a puller for the front
pulley hub so I left it on to remove later) have no scratches or galling.
Didn't have time to measure the crank to see if it has been turned undersize
previously and could not tell from the bearings (only a part number not .10
under, etc.). All is really good news. The pistons have some scoring on the
top edge but the cylinders are not scored. 

The only bad thing I found inside was one half of the cam bearing next to the
cam gear had gouged out metal which accounts for the small amount of metal in
the oil. The only explanation for the engine being locked up when hot was the
metal being hot between the bearing and cam held it tight and when the cam and
all cooled down, the metal was picked up by the oil. The cam surfaces where
they run in the bearings are not scorred but there is a wear pattern on the
cam lobes.

I was so intent on getting the case split to find the cam that I knew was
broken that I overlooked the fact that when I was removing the FI stuff, one
of the injectors was out and it's locking clamp was still attached to the
head. Is it possible that the POP I heard was this injector popping out of
it's clamp?  I couldn't turn over the engine to try to restart it because it
was locked up.

I didn't see the loose injector, but it may have been resting loose in it's
hole. Does this make sense? Can the VW gods really be this kind to let an
injector pop and only one cam bearing fail forcing me to tear down the engine
saving a thrown rod or whatever a few more miles down the road?  A few of the
metal pieces would probably have gotten into the main or rod bearings and
cause major trouble.
