Subject: Re: 1600 problems

My cousins '70 Campmobile had the same problem, his was the number 4
plug, I think.  Anyway, eventually he had to tap it out and get it
re-threaded, after that it worked fine, until he hit some ice this winter
and wrecked it.  :-(  Never did find out why it kept blowing the plug
out, he would put it back in and a couple days later it would blow out
again.  I'm thinking that maybe somehow it just wouldn't get tight enough
and the vibrations would loosen it?
