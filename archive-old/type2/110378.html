&gt; Just go to the smog referee like everyone else coming from out of state with
&gt; a federal model, get smogged, pass and drive it. I'd get an emission test
&gt; done in your current state first to determine if it's worth bringing in your
&gt; vehicle: it may need expensive modifications to be brought into line with CA
&gt; code depending on what the PO did to it before you bought it.
&gt; 
&gt; Email me for details if you are considering doing this in future.

I WAS KIDDING!!!!!!.....(sesssh, I should have include a little joking face).
