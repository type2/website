Hmm...

Ok, hows about this angle, there is a company in my area (just South of
Salem, Or) that specializes in spraying urethane foam sound deadening.  They
do undercarriages and wheel wells.  They also mask off screw and bolt heads
from what I recall.  Has anyone done this before?

So far the most dramatic noise reduction I have achieved was to put a Miller
CIS FI setup on, what a major difference over dual carbs.

  Yikes..well I guess this is why we have this list...there is always
someone

  I have not started my soundproofing proofing project yet, but am gathering
  information.  I don't think I want to go as far a Mathew Bulley
  did but I would like to get the noise down in the cabin of my bus.
  If anyone has any advice or experiences with this, please p-mail me and
I'll
  make a general post of things people have done to tackle this issue.
