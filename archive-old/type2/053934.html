Niall,
One way to find a leak is to take a spray can of starting fluid and squirt 
very small amounts around each fitting that might leak air into the intake 
system after the AFM. (Don't squirt in the intake to the AFM under any 
circumstance). The problem may be with the cloth covered rubber sleeves that 
connect the central air distribution manifold to each of the intake pipes 
for the individual cylinders, in this case the sleeve for the number 2 
cylinder. So check that one out carefully, a leak there could shut down that 
cylinder only. Aside from what you have done, no other suggestions come to 
mind, but those sleeves do stretch and fatigue and become leaky. I'm in Palo 
Alto if you need some assistance. But don't despair, these are all part of 
putting in a new engine.
