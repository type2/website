  It's Friday and I have to say something that is on my mind.  I don't think
it is fair to Ron &amp; Bus Depot, to air every complaint on here before the 
whole list.  Seems to me that one should first try to resolve problems 
directly with Bus Depot first.  We all know that Ron has the best prices 
around and even offers good advice on the best parts to purchase (Brazilain vs
Mexican vs German etc).  We also know that Ron reads the list, and it may
be tempting to post a problem here for Ron and the rest of the list to read,
but I don't think it is the fair thing to do.  If I had purchased a part from
an individual and did not receive it in 2 weeks, I would contact that
individual instead of posting it publicly here on the list.  If I could not
get satisfaction from the individual, then I might warn Listees 'don't do
business with Mr. Anonymous', but that is not the situation with Bus Depot.
Personally I appreciate Ron's presence here and his fair prices and good advice.
  As someone else on here always ends his comments 'just my 2 cents worth'.
                                            Bill &amp; Janyce
