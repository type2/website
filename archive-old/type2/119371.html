Subject: hydraulic jack

Hi Everyone,

I'm attempting to jack up my bus with a floor jack that I purchased a few years
ago. I'm attempting to jack the front of the bus so I can find out why the
steering is so loose.
The jack doesn't seem to want to go up? If I pull the jack out from the bus it
works just fine. I can stand on it with no problem and it lifts me up. It seems
to be that the jack has certain &quot;points&quot; which it needs to reach before it will
be able to lift (this is just speculation).
I've pulled the screw out to ensure nothing was blocking it but I don't know
what else to do.
I would really like to fix it as it cost quite a bit of money and most jacks
don't extend far enough to lift the bus.
Any help would be appreciated.

Thanks,
Harry
