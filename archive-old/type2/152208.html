&gt; I can get the roller assembly to move in the door, but it is caught
&gt; near the edge of the opening (bottom of glass when window is
&gt; closed)...
&gt;
&gt; do I have to cut this out?  Was it Pressed in?

you can actually get it out without cutting anything but it is a lot
easier if you cut a small 1in X 2in hole below where it bolts in under the
vent window, feel around in there and you will find the spot to make an
opening to get a tool or your fingers in there..

it is a PITA job but not really hard, I got a new assembly from Busted Bus
