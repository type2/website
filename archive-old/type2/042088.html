Subject: Re: Dual vacuum fix

&gt; I had our '76 2000ccFI in the shop to get an idling problem fixed. They
said
&gt; that the total advance was too high, so they disconnected the vacuum hoses
to
&gt; the distributor (dual vacuum can) and timed the engine to 26 degree total
&gt; advance and replaced the points.
&gt; Now the engine runs like crap and overheats.

They are a bunch of idiots!!!   DO NOT GO BACK!!!

&gt; Please help me unfix it by telling me which way to reconnect the vacuum
hoses:
&gt; The advance goes to the intake air distributor vacuum?

NO!  The advance [outer nipple] goes to the nipple on the front of the
throttle housing. This is ported vacuum. You should have a tee and the other
line goes to the EEC valve on the back of the air cleaner.


&gt; The retard goes to the rear of the throttle valve housing?

NO!  It goes [inner nipple] to the nipple on the right side of the plenum
between #1 + #2 intake runners. You need a tee and the other line goes to
the fuel pressure regulator.

Set your timing at idle with the vacuum lines connected to 5 degrees after.

&gt; They also disconnected the small vacuum line leading to the EEC cut off
valve
&gt; on the air cleaner body, where does that one connect?

To the advance side of the dist.
