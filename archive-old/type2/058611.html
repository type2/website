Subject: Be honest... How fast?
Content-Disposition: inline

I drive about 3/4 throttle when cruising in light motorway traffic. That gives
me a speed of around 65 mph on the speedo, but I can (&amp; do) go up to 80mph
when necessary. I won't go over 80, even though the camper could, because the
directional stability leaves something to be desired! It is a 2 litre in a 73
camper, loaded up. It has a rev limiter so theoretically has a max speed
somewhere in the 85-90 region.
