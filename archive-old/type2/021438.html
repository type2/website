Subject: tools, shops, and what i did today
References: &lt;F214hYSoOZzHZlJ2HxY000051a0_at_hotmail_dot_com&gt; &lt;026a01c102b9$33474a80$540d4ed8_at_hppav&gt;

I think this is an important point.  I work in a shop myself, and have 
to buy most of the tools that I use.  Just installing my engine and 
tranny I would say I used about $1500 worth of tools.  These were just 
simple hand tools mind you...
The amount of money spent on tools by mechanics is just insane.  Keep in 
mind most of us &quot;buy off the truck.&quot;  These are tools such as Matco 
(what I usually buy), Snap-on, Mac, etc...  A nice basic wrench set can 
easily run you $300.  I know one of mine did.  Diagnostic equipment and 
specialty tools are a whole 'nother ball game.  A nice tool box is 3-8 
thousand or even more!!  A mechanic works hard for what he has, and what 
he has enables him to work harder and faster.  Sure, a job may call for 
3 hours flat rate, but with the tools and experience and dedication the 
technician performing the job has, it may only take him 1 hour.  Some 
people are upset by this, and I can see their thinking, but one must 
realize what goes into that work.

Treat your mechanic well, and he will treat you *very* well.  Tip 
him/her or go up to them and sincerely thank them.  Hell, buy them 
something to drink while their working on your car.  A little kindness 
goes a long ways.  A disrespectful customer is no fun to work with at 
all!  Trust your mechanic too.  A mechanic who doesn't know what he's 
doing will most likely not have thousands of dollars worth of tools.  He 
has to work for them... Unless he has an enormous bill with the tool 
man!  :)


I'm still rather green to the automotive world, so take it for what its 
worth.  But, this is the way that I see things...

If you really want to save some money, start reading some books and dig 
in yourself!  Thats what I did when I first got into working on cars/buses!

Bus content:  I fueled up the 62 this morning and went on a mission.  My 
mission?  To find a doghouse &quot;snout&quot; for my engine.  The last piece of 
tin hanging off the front of the engine routing air out from the oil 
cooler.  I helped a friend haul some gravel down to his pond for our 
upcoming campout and he gave me one.  Score!  Now I just have to find 2 
more for other friends of mine...

The 62 is running pretty derned good now with a good bit of pep!  2 
running/driving and completely roadworthy buses in my driveway.  Now 
thats a good feeling!

Oh yeah, I installed the snout today and changed my gen/fan belt.  Ever 
try sticking your head in front of the fan shroud in an early bus with 
the engine installed?  Not for the claustrophobic! (sp?)  I had to get 
that snout on there somehow though.
