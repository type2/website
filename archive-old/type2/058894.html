Subject: Re: Home built Gas Analyzer. Any updates?

&gt;&gt;Someone on the list was going to check with some techy friends on the
viability of making a home-made exhaust analyzer. Imagine being able to
tune those multicarbs mixtures to perfection! Anyway, has anyone heard
an
update about this? ...

check out the link below for a full article on doing the very thing.

http://www.pelicanparts_dot_com/914/914tech_articles.htm

Once you get there, select &quot;Building an In-Dash Air-Mixture Monitor&quot;. 
It has complete text and diagrams for doing that.  I would have included
the complete URL to that page, but it ran on for two lines and that's
not nice.

MSD makes a complete kit with 02 sensor and gauge.  They also make a
switch to toggle two sensors between one meter in the case of dual
exhaust setups.

Many performance equipment places also market install-it-yourself kits
with a single sensor.
