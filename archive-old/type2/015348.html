Subject: 77 T-II Engine For Sale
Message-Id: &lt;3.0.5.32.19991108124504.007e67b0_at_rockisland_dot_com&gt;

I have available a 77 F.I. motor which tests out very nicely with the
exception of poor leak down on cylinder #3. My scrutiny suggests it can be
a decent motor with replacement of the one cylinder and rings and/or
piston. Other cylinders show less than 5% leakdown. Aushgezeitnet. A true
candidate for efficient overhaul in my mind.

This is an original 125K motor never dissassembled since factory
installation. It is a long block plus good heat exchangers, alturnator, all
tin except alturnator front, flywheel that should be surfaced, a used LUK
German clutch and disc that appears to be in spec. for continued use. 

I can send pix via e-mail to serious inquiries. I want $300. I understand
you can't always get what you want. I do know I want it out from in front
of my shop ASAP.
The buyer will be responsible for shipping. Figure 140 pounds from zip
98250 by common carrier. I can find out cost from local shipper to compare
with what they say on your end in hope of finding best value in that
reguard. Just send me your zip code.

Thanks,
