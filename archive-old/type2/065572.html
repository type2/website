Subject: Value '61 T1, no T2 content

All,

A friend of mine, Martin, wants to sell his '61 Bug. 90.000 org. Km,
original paint, maybe three -very- minor dents, unripped but somewhat dirty
headliner, org. upholstery, still in factory plastic covers (the vinyl material
is never sat on without the covers on it) old Phillips radio, Blaupunkt
speaker, original tools in place, org VW period bulb set which was sold 
with the car, no cracks in steering wheel, seatbelts, engine seems like 
its never been removed from the car, can see car color in the 
heaterchannels through the front heater vents, all chrome perfect, all
electrical connectors clean and shiny, all wires perfectly smooth and
untouched, speedo, wiper mechanism, hood latch, inside &amp; outside
gas tank all absolutely new, cardboard parts in trunk undamaged,
original rubber intact in *very* good condition, no cracks or discoloration,
outside paint slightly faded, runningboards, emergency brake boot and
fender beading are org. green rubber, even the license plates show
no evidence of ever being removed after it left the dealer, window
mechanisms operate smooth and quiet, doors have never been opened,
(the upholstery removed i mean :)  ) has some &quot;touch ups&quot; in the spare 
wheel well above the washer and brake fluid reservoirs with red iron primer,
the washerfluid reservoir is scratchless and spotless white, as are the sun 
visors, has org. package tray under the dash with dealer sticker on it,
all glass unscratched, body is absolutely good but has a -little- surface rust
here and there, the top edge of the engine lid and in the vent area under
the rear window, really not bad but it must be taken into consideration,
i spent four hours around it yesterday night and i could not detect a single
thing that wasn't original (apart from the license plate, radio and factory 
accessories) The only fasteners that showed evidence of being removed 
were the ones from the rear breasttin, the rest is in pristine shape, incl. color 
(light gray and black) there is some play in the door hinges. In the trunk is a 
little old bucket that the original owner used to wash the car, in the bucket 
an old can of Shell 10W30. Martin is the second owner.


What would the value of this car be, or have you seen a car like this being 
sold and remember the asking/selling price? Any input is greatly appreciated.


TIA,

Brian.
