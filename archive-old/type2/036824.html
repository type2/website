Stephen,

Geez, I thought *my* FLAPS sucked! Yer bein' had!

Bus Depot sells German for $39.95, Brazillian for
$11.95 (these are for the front...rear are cheaper, I
think). My local FLAPS is about $6.00 higher on both,
as are other places I've checked.

Also, everyone tells me the Brazillians are just as
good as the German. Dunno if I believe that, but a VW
mechanic friend runs Brazillian on all his bugs,
busses, etc., and he owns the shop, so he can have
whichever he chooses. I guess that's a pretty firm
testament.

If I were you, I'd tell my 'friend' that I was taking
my biz elsewhere!!!

&gt; hello all,
&gt; 
&gt; Last time i was at my flaps i asked about 64-70
&gt; brake cylinders.  they had
&gt; german (didnt even ask) brazillian for now $25?? and
&gt; taiwan made for the
&gt; old $10 per or so...
&gt; 
&gt; Now, the guy at the counter, a friend of mine said
&gt; the brazilian supply
&gt; has dried up/prices gone up since varga got bought
&gt; out.
&gt; 
&gt; Anyway, the brazillian ones looked nice.  The
&gt; casting looked nice,
&gt; head and shoulders above indian brake cylinders i
&gt; have installed (just
&gt; two, but never agaoin if i can help it.) the bores
&gt; looked well polished
&gt; to my untrained eye.  An interesting tidbit was that
&gt; the piston was
&gt; anodized! gold colored even...  This seems to be a
&gt; good thing as standard
&gt; pistons can pit after water exposure, but anodized
&gt; aluminum does not for
&gt; all intents and purpouses.
&gt; 
&gt; So now i must ask...
&gt; 
&gt; anyone seen/used these in person and have an
&gt; opinion?
&gt; 
&gt; thanks,
&gt; 
&gt; Steve
