Cresting a hill at 75 and coming upon stopped traffic?
How about a downhill with a stopsign hidden at the bottom- being a long
time cyclist, I'm very cautious of blind downhills.
I got a ticket near Cornell once doing 75 down Rt 81 hill (was 55
then)....I argued I had to go that fast to AVERAGE 55, as climbing up
the hill dropped me to about 35!

&gt; &lt;&lt; Well said.  Busses have enough trouble stopping quickly from 60mph.  Think
&gt; about cresting a hill at 75mph in your bus and seeing traffic stopped in the
&gt; road ahead... a scary thought, especially in a Westy loaded with people and
&gt; camping equipment.

&gt; Cresting a hill at 75mph...? Sounds like an urban, sorry, highway legend to
&gt; me...?-)
