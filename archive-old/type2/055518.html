Okay.  I got to thinking this weekend.

I have that transporter with nasty holes in the roof, a bed and pop top
off a 74 westy in my yard, and a mish mash of interior parts that almost
make an old school campmobile interior...

&quot;What can I do with all this?&quot;, I asked myself.  Waiting for a 74 westy
without a pop top so I could cut the roof off will take forever- and I
would rather have the plan for the bus sooner-  I don't like to cast the
fate of my air-cooled frined to the wild winds of fortune-

So then it hit me.  Hole in roof, big piece of fiberglass, bed, no need
to preserve a stock bus.....

I'll make a Dormobile!

Sorta.  I mean, support the roof I have, maybe some lateral support for
the roof, fabricate a front nose for the top..

The hard part will be opening it-its so high, where do you stand? .  My
big hole is in the back, so maybe I'll leave it there and make that the
entrance hole.

I assume the dormobile roof got some suport from the proximity of the
drip rails-  they seem to be right on it.

Make some canvas, secure the hole a bit, hinge the side, but up the bed
on one side (over the center), maybe get a ladder and put one of those
zipper/skeeter net/ tent doors on it so you could get outside (and so
you didn't have to step on your sleeping frinds below....)

So what do you all think?  I have nothing to loose (except time).  Throw
me a bone-   punch holes in my plan so I can fix them.

P.S.  Does anyone think it will work???
