Subject: Re: [T2] I just stripped the interior of my 73 Westy...

Why baltic birch? Aside from authenticity that is... 

Biscuit joints. Yep. Those staples surprised me! I didn't expect
staples in cabinets that would experience the vibration of a moving
vehicle. But they've held up for 30 years, so who am I to disagree? ;)
But I agree on the biscuit joints.

AGA stove = $$! Unless you're talking about something else... If I
don't find another stock 73 kitchen to use, I'll just build a second
jump seat. IIRC, the 73 just had an ice box and a sink, right? Though
my bus does have a propane tank...
