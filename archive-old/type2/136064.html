Subject: Re: '76 VW Stalls _at_ start-uo

&gt;This is a '76 California Transporter, standard trans.
&gt;The VW does NOT want to run for the first 100 feet. 
&gt;It will stall if I press the gas, even in the
&gt;driveway, so I have to punch the gas pedal to keep
&gt;the revs up before I go into first/reverse gear.  And
&gt;it will want to stall in gear, too. But after the
&gt;first mile or less, it is a dream, and no problems at

&gt;stop signs or stop and go traffic.  But it takes the
&gt;first  mile to get it there.

This sounds like a lean condition. It could be a
vacuum leak but it's a classic description of dirty
fuel injectors. I've had good luck with Chevron
Techron.
