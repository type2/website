Subject: Can someone remind me why I love buses?

AAGGGGHHH!!!

It was not a good first day for ownership of my new Westy...

I bought her yesterday. Prior to laying out the $$$ I did a thorough
visual inspection and road test myself. Then I drove her 30 miles (and
back)to a reputable shop and had them do a prepurchase inspection. No
major problems and they thought she was a good deal. Rebuilt engine and
new tranny. The PO seemed up-front and provided old repair records
without flinching. The car drove well and is rust-free. I started to
fall in love...

24 hours later and within 15 miles of home: The car decided not to start
when hot; the driver's window stopped working and when I looked inside I
saw the plastic piece that holds it on track had snapped; and the sink
won't work (my doggy is sad about that one 'cuz he gets his H20 that way
on many trips). Worst of all, my regal and beautiful westy got a real
bad case of gas when parked outside my office and backfired all the way
home from work. I know I caused at least one poor vet to hit the deck!
She won't idle and I had to pump the accelerator to avoid stalling on
the famous San Francisco hills.

I am trying to keep my chin up. I know I want to learn more about
working on VW's and already I have been presented with opportunities. I
just didn't expect them so soon. I loved my old '78 Westy and I only
sold her because of skin cancer. Am I being punished for switching to a
vanagon? (she's an '82) I just hope it's not a bad omen. 

Anyway, thanks for letting me vent. If anyone has a word or two of
wisdom, or better yet, can make me laugh, it will be much appreciated.

Take Care,
gf
