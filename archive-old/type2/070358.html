&gt;khooper} it's one of those teddy bears, because of their provenance and their
&gt;khooper} metaphorical value...
&gt;
&gt;Do people actually know the origin of that bear?

The legend is that the dancing bears were printed on blotter paper, that
became blotter acid, that was sold by one of the Dead (I forget who) in the
Early Days. I'm very sure that cops regard the dancing bears as a metaphor
for drugs, any drugs as long as they're illegal. They probably have cop
seminars to discuss and learn about the grave implications of dancing
bears.

Waitaminute. Howcome I gotta tell *you* this stuff, Mr. Gratefully
Deadicated? ;)
