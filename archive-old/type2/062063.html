Subject: Re: Cleaning Westy Top

Ive been told that the best way to clean the top is with a stiff brush.  Back
in my boat deteailing days we used citrasolve and a stiff floor brush. I Id
avise against to much sanding..laying fiberglass is nasty, toxic, messy and
gross. We got everything off fiberglass boats w/o delaminating the 'glass: a
tooth brush w/ straight citrasolve (dont forget to rinse!) for the tough
spot. Dont know bout the canvas- mines 1/2 duct tape.
Good luck on the pancake (Duncan shutters in memory of his own pancake wowes)

happy w/my guttless 1600
