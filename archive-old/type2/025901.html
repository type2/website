&gt; Interesting to note that when &quot;switching&quot; CV's. more is required than
&gt; simply flipping the the axle end for end.  You actually need to pull off
&gt; the CV and flip it over and then install it back where it came from.  Then
&gt; you will be loading it in the other direction.

If you do this, you'll never get the boot to seat. There's a groove machined
around one side of the CV for the boot flange to rest in. It's only in one
side.

If you're trying to &quot;load the CVs in the other direction,&quot; whatever that
means, take both axles off. Mark which end went toward the wheel, and
connect that CV to the wheel adapter on the other side of the Bus.
