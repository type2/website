You will probably find answers in the archive.  For example:

http://www.type2_dot_com/archive/type2/027829.html

Since you buggered your current mirror, you should note that certain Jettas
rear view mirrors will work ( they are generally newer and in better shape
than the sun damaged VW bay mirrors) and I have a Vanagon 1980 rear view
mirror in my '78.  The Vanagon mirror section is quite a bit larger than the
bay rear view mirrors, and it does interfer with my sun visors should I turn
them down, but that is so infrequent....

Originally, I used the Vanagon rear view mirror so I could see more of the
back seat with my two kids, plus I could see out of my right rear side
window (a '78 Westy) and watch cars pull up from behind to pass me on the
right side.

The later Vanagon rear view mirrors are angled towards the windshield more
so than the '80 Vanagon and bays' rear view mirror and will not fit.  The
Jetta's will fit.
