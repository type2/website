Subject: Re: [T2] rear wheel bearings



&gt; 
&gt; Horrible surprise on &quot;Tulip&quot; ('73 with auto tranny) when I jacked her up last 
&gt; night to adjust the brakes: One rear wheel wobbled freely. I tightened the 
&gt; axle nut to take out the extreme looseness. Rotating the wheel produced no 
&gt; crunching or squealing noises. 
&gt; I assume both bearings and races will need to be replaced. My question is: 
&gt; can I possibly continue to drive her for another two weeks and no more than 
&gt; 120 miles of 35 mph easy driving?
&gt; Thanks in advance,

Probably, but be sensitive to sudden increases in noise or vibration level.  I 
had a funny vibration that I couldn't figure out from the back of my '71 that
turned out to be the inner bearing on the left side.  The inner race was in
three pieces.  While sussing this out, I drove a couple of thousand miles
from Montana to Oklahoma and across to SoCal.
