I live in the downtown of a major metro area of about 2.5 million,

&gt; cars are in good condition.

yeah we got a lot of those around here too
&gt; 
&gt; The city where I live (Cookeville) has recently passed a law saying that 
&gt; all the vehicles at your house must be registered or they get towed. That 

we have the same, I had a 71 in my backyard for a while and I had to keep
tags and insurance on this non operating bus. and I still got at least two
citations that I had to go fight....

&gt; like motorcycles, four wheelers, and dirt bikes but I don't want to live 
&gt; with the sound of them outside my house daily nor look at some fellow's 

hmmmmm, all the drug dealers in the city now use these dirt bikes to
outrun the cops..

yes I decided about 3 years ago that moving would be more trouble than
it's worth, so am doing a lot of fixing up around here (which is why I'm
not getting much work done on my bus) fortunately there are some rental
garages right behind my house, so I rent two and park on a pad in front of
them...one garage for house &quot;stuff&quot; and the other for valuable VW parts...

have tried to buy the garages several times but they want to sell em all
or nothing not just the couple I want to buy.

oh well we all have our own little issues, I still wouldn't move to the
suburbs just an ole city slicker.
