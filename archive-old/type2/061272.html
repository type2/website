Subject: Pressure Control Valve on Type IV Engine

Hello Volks!

I am in the middle of my first rebuild.  All has been going well thanks 
to months of reading the type2 list!

The problem is that I can't find the oil pressure control valve.  I 
found the oil pressure relief valve under the oil cooler a large slotted 
screw on the left rear of the engine pointing down.  No problem.  But 
where the heck is the control valve plug?  There are globs of grey goop, 
sealing over various holes on the engine from the previous rebuild; I 
suspect the plug may be covered over.

According the the Muir book it should be between the #1 pushrod holes.  
But that hole has no slot, star or hex shaped part to remove.  Looking 
at a diagram in the Bently publication it should be on the right side 
just under the oil breather.  Nothing there.  And the Wilson &quot;How to 
Rebuild Your Volkswagen...&quot; does not even indicate where it should be.

I sure would be happy if someone could point me in the right direction.

My engine is from a '79 bus, and has a &quot;GE&quot; engine code.

Thanks!!!
