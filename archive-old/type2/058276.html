Todd,

Thanks for your response -- I appreciate it!

&gt; 

Yes, this tranny has bolt on side cover flanges.

&gt; 
&gt; Given the age of the trans it wouldn't surprise me
&gt; if someone else has got in there before you and
&gt; may have left the small split thrust ring from under
&gt; the flange, where it butts up against the differential
&gt; inside the transaxle, off.  If they did leave it off it
&gt; should give about a fat 1/16th of an inch movement
&gt; in and out.

Bus has about 130K on it according to the PO and the tranny is sort of
oozing all over. Over the next week I'll drain and replace gear lube,
and do the engine tuneup.  I would like to pressure wash the under side
before working on it but feel the torn boot should be replaced first. 
When I get the CV joint off I'll check for axial play.  If It is more
than 1/16th inch should I remove the side cover and check for the
spacer?  This is not a primary vehicle and it will be used just to run
around town during the interior/exterior restoration so I'm not inclined
to invest in the engine/tranny at this time.  Still, it would be nice to
know I'm not creating a larger problem by driving it as is.

Thanks again,  DC - Manhattan Beach, CA
