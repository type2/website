Bob,

I assume from the last part of your note that you are in California, but if 
your friend is elsewhere, I have 3 buses, 70 and two 71s that have no 
engines. If you are anyone are looking for a body to put an engine in, drop 
me a private email. Im located in North Central Florida.

Thanks,
David

&gt;Wanted 68-71 bus, to buy!
&gt;
&gt;My friend was T-boned last week in his westy, by a BIG yellow school bus.
&gt;Luckily there were no children in the bus, and no one was hurt. The westy
&gt;was totaled however.
&gt;
&gt;If anyone knows of a 68-71 bus *any type* for sale, please call or pmail 
&gt;me.
&gt;I am in the market to buy it this week.
