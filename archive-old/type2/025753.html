&gt; Hello everyone---Had a successful Engine pull---with the help of my friend
&gt; Julio--I want to replace the Push Rod Tubes and Seals---but i am having
&gt; trouble getting the darn things out---any helpful hints about getting these
&gt; out---Dummy book says to gently use pliers and they come right out---well
&gt; they dont seem to be coming out---I have 71 1600 DP engine---that is out of
&gt; the car and the underneath tins are off---Thanks for the help--Adam

Take the head nuts off and pull the heads out just a little way. They don't
even need to come all the way off. You won't need to &quot;gently use pliers&quot;--
pull the heads out about an inch and the pushrod tubes will fall out on
their own.
