Although still solid (knock on wood) one of these days my original, 33 year 
old muffler is gonna need replacing.  I know that I need to get the proper, 
single tail pipe exhaust, but after browsing lots of Vendor's sites there's 
terms/nomenclature I don't understand.  The library didn't help since those 
articles deal with the TypeIV engine.  Does anyone have an &quot;upright exhaust 
for dummies&quot; article?  It would be nice to read about everything including 
aftermarket/performance parts and how they differ from stock.

John
