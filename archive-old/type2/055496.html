Subject: Crew Cab Roof Racks

All this yappin about roof racks is gettin to me.

I want to put a rack on my 61 crew cab.  I purchased a very nice half length 
one (plug, since it is now for sale!), but it only fits my kombi.  As you 
know, the roof tapers at the front, and the legs on the rack are too stiff to 
be persuaded to bend.  Any ideas out there?  

I have seen the brochure from the guy in Washington who makes racks. . . nice, 
but I want an original one.  I would gladly trade this one, or sell it.

This is an all steel rack made from 2 different diameters of tubing.  Very 
straight and painted white.  It even has 2 original clamps.  That is what I am 
looking for my crew cab.
