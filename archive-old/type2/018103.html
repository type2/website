Upon changing my oil, I noticed that my oil pressure has dropped.  I
kept the oil weight the same at 10W40.  Can anyone explain the drop in
oil pressure.  I only had the pressure guage for the last 1000 miles on
the previous oil change.  The oil pressure actually dropped low enough
to kick on the idiot light, as I came to an idle after cruising on the
highway.  The oil pressure is a good 25 psi at highway speeds, but still
less than it was before the oil change.  Any thoughts would be greatly
appreciated.

PS.  Last weekend I had to jack a strandees car with vice-grips.  New
car, but missing part of the jack, rendering it useless.
