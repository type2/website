	**what are the main problems related to brake fluid leaking around
the 
	master cylinder?**  i'm hoping i can determine the issues this
evening, so 
	i can order more parts and get them by next week.  the hose from the
upper 
	reservoir to the main container on the master cyl. was old, but i
neglected 
	to replace it.

On my Bus there is a rubber sleave that goes between the nipple and the hose
from the upper reservoir.  I'm not sure if this is stock but the first time
I didn't get it on straight and got leakage no matter how tight I clamped
the hose on.
