Volks,

After our discussions last week on Westy plaid colors, I thought it would
be a good idea if we had a library of what plaids went with what years of
which conversion.  This would be for both the upholstery and curtain
materials.  

What I would like to ask is for those of you with a digital camera and a
camper with what you know is the original fabric to go out and take a
picture and send it to me, or (far better) put it somewhere where I can
grab it.  Try to get the camera as square as you can to the fabric and get
a full repeat of the pattern. Probably the best place to find a clean
square section is the bottom of one of the bed cushions.  In addition to
the picture, I will need to know the year of the bus, which conversion,
what the original exterior pain color is/was and whether this is an
upholstery or curtain sample.  I will make up a page and put it in the
library.

This is not limited to Westfalias!  If you have an Adventurewagen, or a
Safare, or another conversion, and you know the fabrics are original, take
a picture and let me know!  

At present, I have only two samples, tho.  The first is the Mustard
colored cloth used in the '73 Westy, the second, I don't know, but *think*
it is the orange plaid from the '76-79 Westies.

The current links are:

  This is the mustard cloth that was used on the seats and bed of the 1973
  Westfalia only.  Prior Westies used a mustard colored vinyl.
