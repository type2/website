 I believe I got mine either from Wolfsburg West or West Coast Metric.

I am missing the rubber seals which run along the outside of 
&gt;the bumper splash pans.  I know somebody (probably a bunch of somebodies) on 
&gt;the List has had to have run into this problem before.  Where can I find 
&gt;these seals?
