&gt; unless im wrong the washers act as spacers so that the tappet doesnt meet

&gt; something like that. i cant remember where i read this so can someone else
&gt; back me up?

Interesting theory but doesn't stack up because the rockers are held hard
against the 'C' shaped mountings whether the washers are present or not.  It
would make sense if the washers were installed *outside* the two rockers.
