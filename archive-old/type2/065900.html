&gt;Hi,
&gt;Thanks to all of you that responded to my previous post about overheating. I
&gt;recieved many mesages that reassured me I may not have a problem. I decided
&gt;to post this to find out if my readings are normal. The engine is a rebuilt
&gt;2.0 in a westfalia . Running at cruising speed on a flat (or as flat as Utah
&gt;roads allow) _at_ 3400 rpm _at_ 60 mph I see the oil temperature at 220-230 and oil
&gt;pressure at 22 psi. How does this compare to your engines, the only
&gt;comparison I have is my old 71 camper that ran around 190 on the flat. Any
&gt;comments would be appreciated, I have double checked the timing and mixture
&gt;are set proper and am running 30w oil.

22 psi is a problem.  My guess is that your cooling flaps are not open all
of the way, or you have some kind of problem with cooling tin.  The first
thing I would do is put in 15-50 synthetic or 20-50 dino oil.  That should
raise the pressure a little.  Oil temp doesn't look too bad, but I bet if
you drove 52 mph in third gear on that same level ground for two miles your
oil temp would skyrocket.  Start by checking the thermostat.  If you have
to, remove the fan housing and make sure the flaps are installed and
functioning properly.  One of the service manuals should be able to explain
how this works.

Make sure the two pipes that come up through the tin from the heat
exchangers are either plugged or connected via hoses to the fan hanging
from the roof of the engine compartment.  Otherwise, hot air will pour out
of them and be sucked in by your engine.  Your engine seal should be
complete and in decent shape.  Timing should be no more than 7.5 degrees
BTDC at idle.

Another thing that could be causing it to run hot is a lean fuel mixture.
Unfortunately I don't know how to diagnose this but a trip to the smog
inspection station might yield some interesting data.

Whatever you do, don't drive it much until you get the problem resolved, or
you could be facing major engine work in the near future.
