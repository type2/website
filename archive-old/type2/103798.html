&gt; Optima Batteries are on sale at www_dot_canadiantire_dot_ca again,

I'm still trying to figure out the advantage of the $130 Optima over a $50
Pep Boys battery in a $10 plastic battery box.  The optima is nicely
sealed (not totally though, as it still can vent), but that completely
removes any chance to revive it if it gets overcharged.  One stuck voltage
regulator and that expensive battery is toast.

The warranty for the
optima is slightly better (replacement instead of pro-rate for the first
three years) but you pay a lot more for it.

If I was running
a race car and really needed the shock-resistance it would be worth the
money (particularly with contengency prizes involved), but for everyday
use in a bus I'd have a hard time justifying it.
