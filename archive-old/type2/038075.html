Subject: Thanks to Ron Van Ness 

Hola,

I just felt the need to sing the praises of this list!  This past weekend I 
used Ron Van Ness' very descriptive and helpful procedure for replacing the 
spring in the front door handles.  DUDE, you're great!  I wish books were 
written and presented in this kind of format, it was so easy to do a moron 
like me was a success.  The only thing that went wrong was when I got cocky 
on the second door and after replacing the spring, I dropped my only allen 
wrench in the unreachable portion of the door Doh!

Now I don't have to reach my arm through the wing windows!

I know this isn't a big deal like transmission or engine rebuild but for me 
it is a start!  

Thanks and have a great week,

Eric
