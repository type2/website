Subject: re: [T2] still more on gas in oil

&gt; hello once again list,
&gt; 
&gt; this is the '77 2L FI hyd. lifter engine with gas in the oil again
&gt; 
&gt; i finally did a compression test. results are as follows:
&gt; 
&gt; 1- 120
&gt; 2- 130
&gt; 3- 97      105
&gt; 4- 97      105
&gt; 
&gt; the 2nd # for 3 &amp; 4 are after squirting oil in the spark plug hole.


 i had the same gas in the oil problem with my 77, i replaced my fuel pressure  
regulater and all is fine now.

was the engine warmed up before the compression test?  engines give strange
compression readings when cold.
