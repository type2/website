&gt; Hey Chai!
&gt; While I don't know what the hose is made of, for these sorts of
&gt; things I always just call an industrial hose supplier and purchase
&gt; suitable hose by the foot.
&gt;
&gt; I don't know where you are geographically but down here in Tucson we
&gt; have a great industrial hose outfit called 'Granberry'.  They've had
&gt; every type of hose I've ever needed.
&gt;
yup I'm in Maryland and always get my hose from Langsdale Holtzman,. real
short lengths they will sometimes give you. especially if you buy a bunch
of other stuff from them.
