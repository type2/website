Subject: generic engine stands

I always seem to have at least one engine apart on the floor of the garage.
When it comes time to test, I use a stand that I made by putting aluminum
rails on a wooden box .

During assembly,  it would be a great benefit if the engine could be
rotated.  I'd like to buy an engine stand that allows this rotation.  I see
generic stands in the Northern Tool and Equipment Catalog that arrives
every so often on my doorstep.

Some questions:
Does a vw engine fit on a generic stand?
Are any adapter parts needed?
Am I correct in assuming that the engine can be rotated on any of these stands?
Is there any reason to prefer the stand advertised in the RMMW catalog that
presumably is customized to fit a vw engine?

Thanks, Jack
