Subject: Themostats for pancakes (available again??)

I went by the Flaps and had a nice conversation with the lovely Glenda.  We
were talking about the thermostats for pancakes and she called up a couple
of her dealers.  One said they had 100 coming in this week and the other
said they had 150 coming in...  Is someone new repoping these?

Peace Brothers and Sisters,
Snoopy
