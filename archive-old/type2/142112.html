GoWesty also sell it but it's cheaper to buy it in qty (large jugs) directly from 303.

I use 303 on my tire sidewalls. I hate those slick looking armorall products and I've never sprayed them on my bus tires.

If the tires haven't been treated with 303 before I give them a good scrub to remove the brown deposits from the brake dust. Then apply the 303 according to the instructions.

The tires have the naturally new look and besides the UV protection it seems to keep the brake dust away. Just the other day I received a compliment on my tires and surprised that person when I said the tires were 4 years old.

I've also heard it's good for preserving seals (although I have an email from Metzler's chemical engineers telling me it's not necessary to apply anything which could be interpreted many ways). FYI.
