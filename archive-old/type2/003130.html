No response as to how others managed to send 20DM and return postage.
All I can say is that my certificate took just  a week from posting.
Nothing too exciting but certainly unique.
I don't object to a worthy contribution to the VW museum, the certificate is
a bonus.
I'd like to go one day.

&gt;Hmm. 20DM and return postage. All money transfers from this side of the
pond cost
&gt;more than the 20DM.
&gt;So, I send cash ! But the smallest denomination for purchase is a10DM note.
&gt;So, I bought 30DM
&gt;which cost me the equivalent  of ~ 36DM.
&gt;I've posted airmail.
&gt;Hmm. I'll forget the cost and wait and see what I get in return.
