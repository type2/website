Subject: CHT wiring

OK folks, every now and then I sit out here and get a laugh out of how
technical or anal or banal some folks can get over having to do things just
right.

Here's a scoop for you. The bus, as we all probably know, is made to take a
beating and keep on ticking. ANd despite Gerry rigging, I see some things on
this list where we
worry about stuff that sounds like engineers at NASA worrying about the
thickness of a washer for weight. If only they'd worry about foam
insulation!!!!!

So, here's the scoop on this...eight feet of wire &quot;might&quot; make a difference
on readings from your CHT, but remember, the idea is to have information
from
a gauge from which to make a decision about what you are doing...it's not
needed to decided how much fuel to use to land on the moon.

Don't rewire your CHT location...it won't matter. The extra lenght might
produce a bit more resistance but not enough to matter.
