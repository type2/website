Subject: RE: petronix ignition

The Pertronix is magnetically based and operates under static conditions,
implying to me that the solid state sensor for this is a hall effect device. 
The hall effect device is commonly available as a proximity sensor that then
turns a transistor on and off relative to magnetic field intensity.

In the Pertronix system you replace your points with the Pertronix device (which
is small enough to fit under your rotor and inside an 009 distributor, but large
enough to include some simple solid state electronics, a beefy transistor or
mosfet that connects to the coil, and possibly a capacitor and/or diode to help
protect the output transistor.  Additionally, there is a magnetic collart that
slides down over your distributor shaft and covers the lobes.  It may be that
the lobes are used to shape the magnetic field which would mean that on
distributors that have the #3 lobe slightly retarded, the Pertronix would
operated the same as points.  

The Pertronix device has two wires that come out through a grommet that fits
into the hole where the old points wire came out.  One wire connects where the
points wire connected on the ignition coil and the other one connects to twelve
volts, available on the other ignition coil terminal.  Just like your points,
the Pertronix device gets its ground from the mounting plate.

You may have gathered that the Pertronix system is merely a replacement for
points.  There are systems that give you more spark energy such a Capacitive
Discharge (CD) systems.  See Hoover's sermon on this subject, he covers it
religiously.  

Bottom line is any system that works with stock points will work with Pertronix.
 With Pertronix, you should never again have to adjust timing and there are no
points to gap or get damp.  I look forward to reliable starting this winter as a
result of my Pertronix system.
