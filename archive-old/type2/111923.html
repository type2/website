Subject: RE: '78 &amp; '79 Deluxe Middle sliding windows

I have a 1973 Transporter and installed the sliding windows on them as
well. 

From what I can tell you, they use the exact same window seal that the
SOLID piece of glass window would use if it was installed. So, if your
car came with a solid piece of glass, no vent windows or anything back
there, then you could use that window gasket.

People say that rust forms easier underneath the sliding windows.
Personally, I think this is because the sliding windows seem to be
smaller than the original pane of glass. If you take a look at the
sliding window after it's been installed, you won't see any gaps, but you
can clearly tell that the outer measurements are ever so slightly smaller
than a normal pane of glass. I guess this allows some more freedom in the
rubber and allows water to get in. You can always use an RTV sealant. 

Personally, I really like the sliding windows. They offer MUCH MUCH more
air-flow to the inside of the bus.
