You're no doubt right, but hey, shiny rust looks a lot better than the
corroded oxidized look I hate so well!
I think the combo of wire wheeling the rust down to bare, shiny metal with
some pits and painting with Tremclad rust paint is a poor man's way of
keeping the rust from developing by leaps and bounds. Lots of junkyards full
of untreated rust. I made a resolution when I bought this bus to attack any
rust that appears instantly with a variety of weapons. Throwing money at a
body shop is not an option. Tom



Bad news, I am afraid. That gleam is burnished rust. The rust is still
there, but now is shiny.
