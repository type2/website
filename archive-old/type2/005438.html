Hi,
hope this goes to the correct address.
just subscribed so I though I'd introduce myself.
I'm in birmingham UK and have just bought my first camper (devon
conversion). I've also got a 72 daily driver bug, a '62 ragtop project and a
half bug trailer
(web page: http://members.tripod_dot_com/~steve_vwworld/mypgae2.htm  )

I'm currently getting the van up to mot condition (outer sills and a few
plates underneath. I'm having probs getting the engine to fire so I thought
I'd ask you lot for some advice.
1, The engine turns over at the correct speed, but doesn't fire up. The
plugs have been checked, cleaned and gapped and the points have been
replaced. There is petrol getting to the carb.
could it be the coil? how can i test this?

2, There is a petrol leak from the pivot where the accelerator cable
attaches to the carb (don't worry I ain't driving it 'till that's fixed).
Would a carb rebuild kit solve this problem or am I looking at a 2/h carb?

3, Does anyone know of any colour coded wiring diagrams on the web?

cheers
steve
