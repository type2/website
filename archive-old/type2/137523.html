&gt;Thanks for the reply.  I thought that there might be a EE out there that
&gt;could create a small circuit that might be able to do the trick and produce
&gt;a digital readout.

I ran the same idea past my father a few years ago -- he *teaches* the EE's 
-- and the short version of the conversation is that while it's certainly a 
feasable idea, it's really not cost-effective to do so.  Cheaper to buy a CHT 
or pyrometer that's already on the market .. unless you're planning to 
&quot;step up&quot; to aircraft-quality gauges.
