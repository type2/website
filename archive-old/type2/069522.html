&gt;:  I expect that the irony of intentionally killing a bunch of Zebra Mussels
&gt;:  in order to make the point that they are endangered was lost as well.
&gt;:  Science as performance art. This kind of stuff makes me scratch my head. ;)
&gt;
&gt;Ummm, last I checked, the problem was that Zebra mussels were
&gt;out-muscling everything else in the area, thus making those other
&gt;aquatic denizens endangered....

Somebody caught me right off. ;)

&gt;&gt;   It's not the zebra Mussels that are endangered, intead it is them that is
&gt;&gt;doin' the endangering.
&gt;
&gt;Once again I learn something. I stand corrected.
&gt;
&gt;(?) Thinking about it, I still fail to see what the point of the excercise
&gt;is, though. Maritime traffic should be banned? The Zebra Mussel problem is
&gt;Volkswagen's fault? This could happen to any ever-so-egalitarian,
&gt;unpretentious person who fell into Lake Eerie?
&gt;
&gt;(How about, if the Museum of Natural History gets its name in the paper it
&gt;gets more funding?)
