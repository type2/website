Subject: loose fan belt/Gene Berg Achiever crank pulley--70 Westy

Listees,

Even w/ all the shims out of my alternator pulley, my new (no more than 20 miles
service) Continental 9.5mm X 905mm fan belt still slips a little when I turn the
engine over w/ a wrench.  This was not a problem on my old engine, and I am curious
regarding the cause.  One of the (many) things that is different on this engine is
that I have added a Gene Berg &quot;Achiever&quot; crank pulley.  I wonder if the pulley is the
cause of the problem, and am curious if others who have used this pulley have had a
similar problem (found nothing in the archives yesterday b/f they stopped working
again).  My curiosity is focused on the pulley because on the same page of the Gene
Berg catalogue that shows the crank pulley, there is a short article about how to
place shims b/t the alternator/generator and the alternator/generator stand to correct
for a too-loose fan belt (p. 67, 95-96 catalogue).  While the catalogue doesn't say
this, I wonder if this pulley is manufactured in such a way that the fan belt is
generally too loose w/o the described adjustment.

The problem I am experiencing is high head temperatures (350 deg. F on my VDO CHT
gauge) and oil over-heating (appx. 225 deg. F since the the GB dipstick temp. sensor
lights up) at 60 mph, appx 85 deg. ambient temp.  I suspect that my fan belt is
slipping since the mixture is rich (135 main jet in 34 PICT 4 carb) and the timing
correct (009 w/ total advance of 30 deg.).  Engine is a DP 1600 cc w/ dog house
cooler, all seals in place, semi-hemi heads, stock exhaust, working oil pressure
relief/control valves, and Jacobs ignition using fresh 94 octane gas.

My plan is to check my theory by seeing if belt dressing makes any difference, then
(regardless of the belt dressing results) follow the advice in the catalogue and try
to place shims under the alternator.  If anyone has done this before (or has a better
idea), i'd be interested in your experience.  It seems as though I should be able to
do this job w/o pulling the engine (yet again).  I'd love advice on where to obtain
appropriate shim stock and the number/thickness of the shims I should expect to use.

Thanks in advance,
