&gt; some bushing between the steering column and the gearbox is damaged.
&gt; the master cylinder (that i just replaced with a remanuf. one) is leaking 
&gt; somewhere.

WRT the steering couplers.
Pulling the steering out of a 68 a few weeks back I did my best to break
it loose from a cracked ancient coupler. It took shears and determination.
Those things have braided wire molded inside.
I have never cut apart an aftermarket one but hopefully they have the wire
as well. Which brimgs me to the thought.
I have read posts in the past where people say that they lost all steering
and others who warn of the exreme hazard of the coupler breaking through.
I have to say &quot;no way&quot; not with this thing. It could have cracked and
caused a lot of play in the steering but I cant believe it could come
apart enough to affect the steering more than 1/4 to 1/3 (im just pulling
thoughts out of the air here). Which brings me back to the Q about has
anyone ever cut open an aftermarket coupler.
If not maybe Ron would sacrifice one in the interest of science??
