Subject: VW Family Feud;  questions needed

It has been set,  the VW FAMILY FEUD will be played again at this years High 
Country Bus Festival.  Once again, the game will be hosted by Richard 
Dawson's drunked cousin: Blistered Dawson.

We need some help comming up with questions for the game.  Once we have a 
list of suitable questions, A SURVEY will be sent to the list.  The answers 
provided to the survey by the list will be the basis for the game.

When you try to come up with questions, think back to the real Family Feud.  
The question CANNOT have one corret answer.  For example:  &quot;How many peices 
of glass are in a 23 window deluxe.&quot; There is only one correct answer for 
this question.

For the VW Family Feud we need OPINION type questions, that could have many 
different answers, depending on who you asked.  For example: &quot;Name something 
you never go camping in your bus without&quot; or &quot;Name an after-market 
accessorie that you added onto your bus.&quot;

PLEASE REPLY ONLY TO ME, not the list.  Submit your idea for questions. IN 
the next few weeks I will compile all of the questions into a Survey and 
send that to the list.

thanks,
