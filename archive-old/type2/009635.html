&gt; 1800 cc engine. Between the tank and the pump the PO had a small
plastic
&gt; filter which dangles below the starter. The first length of hose is
&gt; about 10'' long, then the filter, then the line loops up to the clip
on
&gt; the underside of the vehicle and back down to the fuel pump.
&gt; 
&gt; Is this a kosher setup? It makes sense that the filter would be
*below*
&gt; the starter, but I'm a little uncomfortable with it just swinging in
the
&gt; breeze down there.

I wouldn't want it that way.  Flexible fuel lines are used to make
connections and in areas where some flex must be accomodated.  Letting
connections dangle in the breeze is courting disaster.  Picture a rock
coming along and smashing that filter, then having gravity-fed
gasoline sprayed all over the bottom of the engine!  You should
shorten the lines and secure the filter in a more protected location. 
If the filter is light, it may be supported by the lines.

Keep in mind that putting a filter upstream from the pump is asking
for vapor lock problems, although many do it successfully.  If you
start to experience cutting out on hot days, keep this in mind.
