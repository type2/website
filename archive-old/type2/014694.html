Hi guys, 
A few month ago I bought a 75 bus.  I started driving it daily for two
weeks when I pull my bug engine to rebuild it. Since then my drive to
work or back to home is uncertain.  One day I had a bad raw gas smell
while driving. The fuel hose from pump to fuel riel was pouring fuel. I
stop the bus right away, and fixed it with a spare; after that was fixed
the little hoses from the injectors start to leak too, fixed them, and
the hose that connects left riel w right riel started to dripping gas,
and so and so but I had no more spare fuel hoses so end up to my flaps I
bought 2 yards of german fuel hose and replaced every gas hose in the
engine compartment.
Now I having problems again, this time with vacuum hoses and rubber
fittings. Are all of them deteriorated and affecting engine performance.
I search the bus boys catalog, rocky mountain, Larry off roads and a few
others and I don't see all the hoses and rubbers I need. I know many of
the hoses are standard but many others has a special shape and
thickness, besides there are grommets rubber vacuum connectors etc I
need to replace and I don't know where to buy them or how to describe
them to the parts guy.
Are those hoses and fittings available for a 1800 cc Fi engine?

If some of you can lend me a hand on this matter I will certainly
appreciate it. 
Thanks, 

Edgard
