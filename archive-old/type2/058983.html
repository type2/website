Subject: Cylinder head temp?

I searched the archives on this but wasn't able to get a straight answer.
My question is, What is a normal operating temp. for the cylinder heads.
I have only had my bus a little while, and I installed a vdo head temp.
guage on the #3 cylinder.  BTW I have a 2liter 1979 westy. My average
temp. seems to be about 400-425 at 55mph and about 350 at idle.  Does this
seem normal.  I don't have an oil temp. guage so I don't know how that is,
would it be advisable for me to install one or can I tell what I need from
the head temp. guage? 

Thanks,
