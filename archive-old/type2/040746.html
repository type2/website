Subject: gas additive to guarantee emmisions passing for inspection?

I know that NJ has tightened its emmissions standards, and have heard a
rumor that there is a gas additive (PePBoys has it?) that guarantees
you'll pass emissions or they'll refund your money- anyone know what
this is and why it would work or could it do harm?
