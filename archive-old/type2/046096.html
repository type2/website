Hi John,

I was looking at the early years prior to smog requirements.  1200 to 1300 to
1500 engines.  And personal experience in a 1960 single cab 1200 to 1340
conversion.  CCed the heads and adjusted the compression with shims no other
non stock changes.  Ran rich with stock spec 1200 carb.  Plus years of setting
up carburation on a vast variety of vehicles, both stock and high performance,
foreign and domestic.

the way I see it,

Since the velocity of the air through the venturi pulls in the fuel (due to the
pressure drop) through a fixed oriface (jet), any increase in that velocity
results in a correspondingly greater fuel flow.  Since a larger cylinder
necessarily displaces a larger amount of air per stroke, and the venturi
diameter remains the same, the velocity of the air through the venturi must be
higher.  That will pull in a greater amount of fuel at any given throttle
angle.

&gt; Jet size changes were a result of SMOG rules, not displacement changes.
