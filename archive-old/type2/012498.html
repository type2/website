hello list. i figured i'd save this question
for a friday so here goes.

i have the opportunity to purchase some of the
original ice cube trays that came in a 
bay window westy.  i know their condition is
excellent.  my question relats to the value of
these 2 items. there are 2 trays &amp; 2 ice cube
separators.

neither myself or the seller has any idea of
the approx. value - but we are both aware that
these are a very hard to find original item.

so how much should i offer to pay? i dont want
to low-ball the seller &amp; the seller doesnt want
to ask for more than they are really worth. of
course i know this is all relative - a wise man
once said &quot;any item is only worth how much someone
is willing to pay you for it.&quot;

TIA - please respond directly. i'm in digest mode.
