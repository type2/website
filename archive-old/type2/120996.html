Subject: Re: [T2] Compression in a new engine with only 5 miles?

jeff,
Run the engine a bit first then try again.  My friend and I did a test
on his mitsubishi eclipse when it sat for a little bit and got:

100, 80, 25, 25

then we ran the engine and tried again:

185, 185, 185, 185 ;)

&gt; Hi All:
&gt; 
&gt; Still looking for the reason why it is hard to get this new engine to
&gt; idle and run well. The engine has only 5 miles + 20 minutes of runtime
&gt; on it. It was a completely new rebuild (new pistons, rings, heads,
&gt; etc.). I did a compression check on it today and got the following:
&gt; 
&gt; 1- 85-90
&gt; 2- 110
&gt; 3- 95
&gt; 4 -110
