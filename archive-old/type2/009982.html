Steve Dolan and I played phone tag yesterday (Thursday), but our plans to
actually meet face to face didn't pan out.  He did get on a chassis
dynamometer in the Seattle area, but I don't know the results of that
session. 

I just talked to Steve's friend in Seattle.  Steve hit the road this
morning headed back to the DC area.  He's attending a wedding next
weekend, and felt he had to get moving to allow for any unplanned
&quot;adventures&quot; en route.

Steve apparently decided to head East on I-90 at least as far as
Missoula.  From there he'll aim for the Twin Cities and home.  He had
mentioned earlier going all the way across North Dakota and into
Minnesota on I-90, but may have amended that plan.
