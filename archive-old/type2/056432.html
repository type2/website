Subject: All hail King Karl!

I have seen Karl Von Salzen's name dropped quite a few times here the last
week or two - not to mention his posts of his junkyard finds!
I myself have been the recipient of Karl's zeal; several Mercedes fuse
blocks (for wiring up accessories), a brake cylinder or two and I think
more...  sometimes he doesn't even want the $$$ I offer.

I just wanted to make a public acknowledgement of one of our  valuable List
members, who we often take for granted........

70 Neunsitzer
65 Pritschenwagen
