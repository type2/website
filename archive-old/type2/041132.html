Subject: Re: Bus People

Thom's list doesn't include *my* type, and maybe a bunch of folk's type.
Here's what I think it is:

Some people have a specific task that needs doing: hauling people, hauling
things, travel and camping. These people have to do a lot of driving, and
aren't too loaded with cash. They look at the options and decide that a bus
is the way to go, based on its simplicity, average price, reliability, and
ease of maintenance and repair. They might also like aspects of the bus
culture, but the important thing is that a bus is the right vehicle, still,
all these years after the last one was sold new in the U.S.
