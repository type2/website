Hello All,

In case anyone else had the same question.

Thanks very much for all the replies!!

Looks like it is shiny side down.

(Thanks Blake and Bill!)

So I thought I was slick to get it installed in 30 minutes.
Make that an hour......

Thanks much for the info now I know.....

David.


&gt;My friend's '78 has (make that _had_) the original seal in it.
&gt; Shiny side is down in his.
