Subject: Engine problems :(

Well, I just tested the compression on my engine and it was 120, 30, 
120, 120.  So, I guess I better drop the compression on those high ones 
cuz otherwise I'm gonna blow those heads off!!

  -- just kidding :) --

But, yeah, so, I'm down to 30psi.  Not too thrilling.  I adjusted the 
valves on my #4 cylinder (the 30 one) and it didn't make a difference. 
I hear a wierd knocking noise coming from the engine so I don't know 
what's up.  The piston is still moving (felt it with a screw driver) so 
I don't think a rod is broken.  It's a 78 with hydraulic lifters.

Any ideas?

MIke
