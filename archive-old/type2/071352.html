&lt;&lt; n an effort to make owning a bus more fun, VW engineered in some time
 delayed features into my bus.  &gt;&gt;

I think one of the best features ( unadvertised by Volkswagen) is the engines 
ability
to purge itself of old, dirty motor oil while you drive, or even while parked 
in your driveway. Mine has this feature, and it's saved me plenty in costly 
oil changes! And I never have to worry about getting old used motor oil to a 
recycling center. VW was also wise enough to carry this feature over to the 
cooling systems of the later water-cooled Vanagons.
