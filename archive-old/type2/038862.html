Hey Folks-
    It seems I don't have as much time as I thought I would &amp; I have to
sell my Bus. It has a fresh motor in it with about 2 miles on it since
re-build. The interior is in excellent condition, needs canvas though. I
started to do some bodywork-but it needs finishing. I'm asking $1500.00
for it, please contact me off list for more details. Thanx
Carl
