Subject: Re: [T2] 72 Westy color  L90D pastel white or L567 ivory?

&gt; we dragged my friends 72 poptop Westy over to the paint shop today
&gt; but there is no paint code sticker on it, so what color would it be ?
&gt; the Wolfsburg west site gives 2 whites   L90D pastel white or L567 ivory?
&gt; anyone have a paint code tag on there Westy or know for sure the color code ?

I can hardly believe it is Ivory since this color was mostly used on
Ambulances. It is probably Pastell White. To be sure you can check the
metal plate behind the drivers seat. There are four lines of codes on
the plate (the second line might me empty). Check out the first four
digits on the third line. Then go to the URL of my M-plate page and you
will find out:

	http://www.type2_dot_com/m-codes/t2colors.html

If you like, you can send me all the codes on the plate. I am interested
in them. I keep a database to figure out unknown codes.

One more thing about the colors. You can really tell Pastell White and
Ivory appart. Pastell White really IS white, Ivory is much more yellow,
something like a newspaper that has been in the sun too long.
