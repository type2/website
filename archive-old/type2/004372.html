&gt;&gt;  What do you masters of German mechanics advise?  A brim full gas tank
with
&gt;&gt;  stabilizer and good shot of oil in each cylinder?


I've never quoted myself before.  A motorcycle mechanic friend of mind likes
to shut this petcock off and then run the carbs dry each fall, to minimize
the varnish in the carbs.  Any thoughts on that for my 'dub?
