All,

I am the guy with the dropped seat on #1 intake on my 1600 DP.  Has anyone
else seen this?

Well my $50 used head proved to be worth it's salt, I have just completed
my ~600 mile journey w/o any problems!!!  She seems stronger than ever and
am very happy with her.

Thanks for all of the help and advice, I doubt she would still be on the
road w/o it.

Well I now need to get prepared to evacuate for Georges.  Any good flood
precautions?

Thanks,

Brian Allen
