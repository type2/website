To: type2_at_type2_dot_com

im having so much trouble with this thing im thinking
about parting it out.its a 72 westy.name a part and
name a price if i got it and the $$ sounds good i just
might start sending stuff to people.real big stuff
like the fiberglass top and or the inside stuff could
be shipped but you pay for it_dot_can send pics if
explantion of object you want cant be described. if i
get a list big enough of people that want stuff for it
to be worth my time ill part it away.
