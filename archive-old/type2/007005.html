Hi there fellow listees from Edinburgh in Scotland.
I too came across the Burley Hewitt web pages and have just completed 
refitting my 1974 Devon conversion as per instructions.  We dont 
have kool patch here but found tetroseal underbody coating to work 
just as well.  The satisfying &quot;thunk&quot; when rapping on the exterior 
side panels is worth all the work!  
I have found now though that the only problem is when driving round 
the town (very steep hills) that I have difficulty hearing the engine 
due to the insulation and drive by feel and vibration.  As for the 
NASA insulation, there is a foil backed sponge product here that is 
used to reflect heat back out from wall mounted radiators  which 
worked a treat.  One list member complained about the price of Q 
pads, there is a product on the market here for sealing leaking 
roofs and it is called flashband.  This stuff is thick, foil backed 
bitumen, it comes in various sizes, is cheap and is easily fixed and 
seems to do just as good a job.  
Thanks to Mr Burley Hewitt you are a star!
Thanks also to &quot;Spirit of the Fifties&quot; carpet makers they do a 
complete set of carpets for a type 2 which fit beautifully with thick 
felt padding for under a hundred pounds sterling and are excellent.  
Now, where is that midgie cream and axe!!! (Scottish camping)
