Subject: air-conditioning for a '71?

This summer we had our engine die at the beginning of a long trip,
about 90 miles south of Las Vegas. We were headed to South Dakota in
our dark blue '71 bus.  Maybe the new speed limit contributed to the
demise of the engine, because the guy that rebuilt it said that it
got too hot and pretty much voided the warranty, even though it was
only a couple of months since the rebuild.

Anyway, AAA towed us to Las Vegas, and we rented a Ford Club Wagon
for the next week. The Club Wagon was nice, went the 75 mph speed
limit through Utah, Colorado, Wyoming, and Nebraska without any
trouble, and had AIR CONDITIONING, a nice thing to have in August.
But it got less than 15 mpg.

So, now that we have been really spoiled, and since a new club wagon
costs nearly $30,000.00, what can we do to make the VW bus more
comfortable?

Has anyone tried adding air conditioning to a bread loaf?

What is the best way to put a bigger engine in a '71?
