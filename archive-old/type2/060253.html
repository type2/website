&gt; &gt;Oh, and BTW, for those of you that asked, the thing that finally got
&gt; &gt;Skutter started, was to tighten up the valves.&gt;
&gt; 
&gt; Listees in Seattle.....Kate needs help!

&lt;smile&gt; You're right, I do need help. But I think the listees in Portland
can help me better without driving nearly 200 miles. &lt;g&gt; 

&gt; Keep the faith.  This thing has got to run.
&gt; 
Well, it's running. Not running well, but well, it's running. I even drove
her to the store the other day, the cats and I were out of food. And I've
made arrangements with a friend who lives closer than I work, and not over
so many big hills, that I drive over to her house and borrow her van.

Trouble is, she lives in the opposite direction, and while it gives me a
great excuse to spend lots of time at my friend's house, it is not
environmentally sound, and it doesn't shorten my commute much, if at all.
And I bought my baby so that I could take road trips, I work 4-10's, and
these three day weekends every weekend just beg to be spent at the coast,
out in the gorge, up in the mountains... Heh, and I could go up to meet
the Seattle listees too!

So, I really REALLY want to get her running WELL. And the Evil Kate can
hardly wait to show the Evil Housemate how wrong he is. &lt;WEG&gt;

Thanks, you guys, for all your help! Y'all ROCK!
