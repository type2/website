Subject: Re: [T2] warped flywheel? on 76 bus

Well then I guess it was the pressure plate that was not centered.  all
I know is that when I took it back out and realigned everything, it was
smooth.  the point I'm trying to make is that it probably isn't the
transmission at all but the clutch disc/pressure plate probably. g
