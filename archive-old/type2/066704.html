Subject: RE: Need a 1600 Bus case

  we're back to &quot;case-savers again. They make about 3 sizes.
 You may be able to just use the next size larger case saver.

 I'm sure not knocking the &quot;new case&quot; stuff tho.

 I might add my flaps has 3 left at $300 and he says he can't even buy them
for that anymore.

 Isn't NAFTA just the grandest Phreaking thing you ever heard of?

&gt;Howdy all. In my quest to make Joel's old crew cab a daily driver, I find
&gt;myself replacing the engine case, as the old one has one of the holes for 
&gt;the
&gt;cylinder/head studs all stripped out. Anyway, The best price I've found is
&gt;$400
&gt;for a new case, and $100 for a 40 over case. So, I figure that someone out
&gt;there has a much better price on a new case, or at least one that can be 
&gt;bored
&gt;to 20 over. Bear in mind that this is the 1600 Type I case, with special 
&gt;holes
&gt;in the rear of the case to allow the engine brace to bolt on. AS-21 
&gt;universal
&gt;cases also have this feature. Anyway, if anyone can help me, I'd certainly
&gt;appreciate any leads...
&gt;Thanks,
