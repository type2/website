Subject: Re: [T2] wiring a trailer to the bus!!!!??

ok greg thanks alot... i now have the adapter or one like it its a hoppy instead of hidden hitch but looks and is same exact thing as the link you sent me,...
 
ok so still stumped...
 
i understand connecting the adpater up to the lights in the bus.....
 
however where does the plug i am using come into the part?
 
the metal plug ????
 
having trouble wireing the adapter to the metal plug?
 
eerrrrrggg i like doing wireing like i like hanging sheetrock....(sarcastically speaking)
 
the hoppy reads like this...
red.........brake
green..right turn
yellow....left turn
brown...park/tail
white...ground
 
the metal plug i am suing is as this
 
green...right turn
yellow...left turn
brown...tail/park
white...ground
 
 
so i get conncting the adapter with the red wire side to the rear of the bus and then i connect into the metal plug that only has four wires correct? but that will mean i will have to splice off the rubber prong end to wire into the metal plug and then after the metal plug??? wireing the trailer (four wires)two red and two grounds,...
i know its simple but my head is fogged with so much info from yesterdays events and struggles over this...
 
i got four wires total coming out the trailer
two grounds and two reds...
 
from the trailer ????????? to the metal plug to the adapter????
 
thats the problem i am having...
 
wireing it correctly.....????
 
please forgive my ignorance here and thanks for your help already given...
i can see this as being easy as soon as i figure out the rest of the eqaution lol
 
i am just not getting where and when to splice the wires and the right connectons for all this to work?

Hi Chris,

That connector will need an adapter to work properly with the bus. 
NAPA will have it for about $20.

That one bulb has two filaments, so it acts as two bulbs in practice.
