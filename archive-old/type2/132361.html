&gt; Sliding door pops open only about 6 inches but doesn't slide further.
&gt; previously They'd get it closed and it would stop about midway down the
&gt; track and then they'd have to work it ....it's wearing a bit. Are there any
&gt; adjustments that can be made without removing the door? Bus is a 1972.&gt;

Had the same problem on a 72 as a matter of fact.  It turned out that on the
connecting unit (door to slide track) there is a small portion of the hinge
that has a small non-cylindrical shaped, in fact it protrudes out about 1/4
to 1/2&quot;.  This releases a mall hook that keeps the door from sliding back.
On my bus the small protrusion had broken apart.  I am not certain of the
purpose of this mechanism but I had to swap the whole hinge mechanism from
another bus.  Might want to give a look.
