Hello all,

Well, judging by the fact that when I shift into first my transmission
vehemently spits the shifter right back out, I'm thinking that i'm in the
marketfor a new one. Any opinions (dumb question) on whether to go used or
rebuilt, any reputable or recommended shops or rebuilders (I'm in VA) or
sellers that anyone may know of would be apreciated. My bus is a 69 westy
with a 1600 dp engine, by the way.

Thanks in advance,
Jeff
69 Westy &quot;Weezy&quot; currently hobbled
