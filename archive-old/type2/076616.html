&lt;&lt; At one time (1980's) they bragged that their station wagon was rated to 
haul more weight than a Jeep Cherokee.

Would be interesting to see if that is still true about the current models.

There was a recent article in the Automobiles section of the NYTimes that
covered quite a few of the SUV's and how much the manufacturer rated
them. Seems the transition from truck to $TRUCK$ means softening the
suspension to car ride and loosing payload. (Keep those tires soft! Wouldn't
wanna jiggle the latte and spill all over the leather...)
