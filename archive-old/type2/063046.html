Blake,

I saved these notes from a while back; don't remember who sent them to me.
Don't know how far this is from you, but it should be in the general area.

        Norris Foreign Auto, in Elizabethton, TN (Just north of North
        Carolina).. 

        ...Um, the way years go here, it's basically 70's-up, no split window
        busses, but plenty of various vw's of more recent vintage. 


Also, from a file I've been putting together for an upcoming web page:

V W Gil's Parts Rr 1 Oneida, TN 37841-9801 (423)569-9464

V W Philip Foreign Car Service 420 Conklin Rd Jonesborough, TN 37659-6347
(423)753-3800

Vw's Only 2685 Round Top Rd Savannah, TN 38372-6965 (901)925-6127

Don't know how far any of these are from you, but it's a start.

Good luck! Joe
