Subject: RE: [T2] rotary conversion

&gt; I've heard they are good little work horses and get the same 
&gt; gas mileage no 
&gt; matter how you drive them. Fast and hard or slow and easy. 
&gt; Interesting motor design.


When I was in high school, my girlfriend had a Mazda RX3, a little
tin-box station wagon with a rotary engine. Due to a class-action suit
(leaky seals), Mazda had put an RX7 rotary in it. This was the ugliest
looking piece of junk you ever saw - rust holes everywhere (a big rock
wedged into a floorboard hole just barely kept the front seat from
falling through), and it sputtered and backfired at idle. It looked and
sounded like it was ready for its final journey to the nearest junkyard.
But it was really fast!!! I used to get a kick out of pulling up next to
some hot-shot in a souped up Camaro or Chevelle at a light, and blowing
him away pulling out of the intersection. The looks on their faces as
their roaring muscle cars got trounced by a sputtering little Japanese
jalopy held together by Bondo was absolutely priceless! 

Sort-of Bus content:  I believe that Volkswagen still holds the patent
to the rotary engine, having acquired it when they bought the German car
company NSU many years ago (who I think was the first to go to market
with a rotary-engined production car back in the 60's).
