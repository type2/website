&gt; About 2 months ago I was able to salvage an original Volkswagen radio from
&gt; a junk yard.  I gave it some TLC, hooked it up to my 12v tester battery and
&gt; it works great.

All I have left from my 71 beetle from years ago is the radio which I
swapped out for a Pioneer unit that I sold with the car. The beetle radio
slid right into the rails and the face plate fit also. Does a nice job of
making your dash look vintage.
