&gt; Saturday, June 17 7am to 2pm Ridgecrest is having its own &quot;Bug Jam&quot; all VWs
&gt; welcome. It will be located at Nicoletti's Espresso Cafe at 809 N. China Lake
&gt; Boulevard in Ridgecrest. They are charging $15. I just found out about it
&gt; myself. Their advertisement says there will be a raffle for a &quot;1600 engine&quot;.
&gt; This is an inaugural event so I will be there, hopefully in my '80 Vanagon
&gt; WITH auxiliary battery. I know it is short notice and it will be HOT, but it
&gt; might be fun. I have no financial interest in letting the world know about
&gt; this event as I am not selling anything there. Its main sponsor is a VWFLAPS
&gt; in town. Everyone have a nice and safe weekend.

Two questions.

1. Are we talking about Ridgecrest, CA?

2. What is VWFLAPS??
