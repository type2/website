Hey there Mike,
Rear safari windows are available, but they are just like front safari windows
for splits.  They're expensive, and they leak.  A friend of mine has one on his
57, and he hates it.  You really can't use it unless you're parked... if open
while driving, it lets in exhaust fumes...unless you have front safaris and all
your popouts open...even then some *might* get in.  A general bad idea in my
opinion...  I think they are available for the later (64-79?...i don't know if
they were all the same size throughout those years) rear window...  for camping,
I'd just pop the hatch and put up a mosquito net...maybe not even the net...just
pop the hatch and let the breeze flow.  They're basically worthless in my
opinion....
but...to each his/her own

happy friday everyone!

I'm not sick anymore! wahooo!!  I can eat...and breathe normally now! yay!
