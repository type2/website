&gt; Hey all you electronics wizards out there:  I want to monitor the resitance of
&gt; my head temp sensor while driving [...]
&gt;
&gt; So, my question is, can I run a 12 foot wire from the sensor, up to the front
&gt; of my bus, to my digital multimeter (set for OHMs of course) and then run
&gt; another wire from the meter 12 feet back to the motor to the FI wiring
&gt; harness[...]

A few things here in scrambled order:
1. can you put 24 feet of wire without messing up the FI computer?
  It has been done before.  There are a few who have run that length of wire to
their dash and connected it to a potentiometer so that they could change their
fuel/air ratio on the fly.

2. Can you read the resistance of the sensor while driving?
No not directly.  You have to disconnect the sensor from its circuit to measure its
resistance and that would mess up your FI computer.  You can take advantage of a
thing called OHMS LAW and just monitor the varying voltage that is across the
sensor.  This voltage will change as the temp changes.  It won't take you long to
figure out cold = xx volts and hot = yy volts.  When cold, your voltage will be much
higher than when hot.

Finally, all you should need is one wire from the sensor up to the meter to measure
the voltage.  Connect it to the positive input on your meter and connect the
negative input to the bus ground (chassis).

NOTE:  I have not personally done this, but the info is &quot;interpolated&quot;, based upon
basic electronics and the work done by others to vary their fuel/air ratios with
this sensor.
