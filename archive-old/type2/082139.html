Subject: Carburetor question

Does anyone know exactly how the hot idle valve thing on the bottom of the LH 
and RH carburetors for a '74 bus with 1800 engine and automatic transmission 
works or is connected?  The one on the left carburetor has a connection for a 
vacuum hose but I don't know where it would connect. The right one doesn't 
seem to have a connection.   There is also a solenoid type vacuum valve on 
the left side of the firewall that may connect to a &quot;Y&quot; in the hose to the 
power brake booster for this?  What is this?  If anyone can help with this it 
will be most appreciated!!
Thanks,
Jim
