Subject: Re: [T2] T4 Head advice needed - new/used/rebuilt/options

Thanks for the info.

I looked again at the new heads from BusDepot and dont know why i was
thinking they were german heads....they dont mention that these are AMC
heads...

Does any one have any experience with the new heads - or the busdepot
rebuilt heads? I want to go new, but they are REALLY expensive....at least
for our budget

I am running the stock L-jet for the engine - and i know when we first took
it to M&amp;M's they did a full tune-up and said it was running lean they
adjusted the timing.....

Is timing the only thing that can effect the richness/leanness of an engine
with the L-jet? I am familiar with the parts and functioanlities of the FI,
but i did not know of a specific way to adjust the FI to get leaner or
richer - I do know that there are many things that can effect that (vacuum
leaks, incorrect fuel pressure etc etc) Maybe this FI stuff should move to
another thread, but what is the difference between the CA and the standard
FI?

~H~

&gt; &gt;1. What would be the best way to confirm that we have a dropped seat
&gt; without
&gt; &gt;doing any more damage?
&gt;
&gt; Compare the heights of the valve stems. Unless they have all dropped by
&gt; the exact same amount (unlikely) you should have an indication.
&gt;
&gt; &gt;3. Are the 1/2 heads different from the 3/4 heads? i.e. head temp sensor
&gt; -
&gt; &gt;only on 3/4?
&gt;
&gt; They were from the factory but not anymore. I suppose it's possible to get
&gt; a set of heads from a rebuilder that lack the hole for the temp sensor II
&gt; but you can always tap it.
&gt;
&gt; &gt;4. Would prefer new head(s) - which brands are available? pros/cons of
&gt; each?
&gt; &gt;      Bus Depot - German Heads - $415 each
&gt;
&gt; New heads from the vendors usually come from AMC in Spain. Where did you
&gt; see German heads unless they were a unique NOS pair?
&gt;
&gt; &gt;5. What would be the downfall of having one new head and one used head
&gt; (even
&gt; &gt;if the used head was in great condition)?
&gt;
&gt; If you just bolt the head on you might have different compression ratios L
&gt; to R.
&gt;
&gt; &gt;6. Rebuilt heads - opinions? I am thinking that because this engine
&gt; &gt;supposedly had 1500 miles on it when we bought it that they put rebuilt
&gt; &gt;heads on the engine and that is why we are having a problem now - there
&gt; is
&gt; &gt;probably about 2500 miles on it now.
&gt;
&gt; YMMV. Some heads fail prematurely because of poor workmanship. Others are
&gt; great but with the engine out of tune they burn up anyway.
