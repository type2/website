Subject: Trouble along the way.....

We've had some trials, tribulations, and &quot;adventures&quot; with our 1970 Campmobile 
lately, and it's been suggested that a report to the Lists might be in order.  
As this is a lengthy and somewhat convoluted tale I'll break it up into 
smaller pieces.  Most of this text, except the &quot;BACKGROUND&quot; section, is 
excerpted and edited from various 
e-mails sent to individuals in recent days.

BACKGROUND

This Summer the 1600SP in our 1970 Campmobile began to lose power from time to 
time while cruising the freeway.  At first I suspected a recurrence of the 
dreaded &quot;Bosch plug wire terminal blowing off&quot; syndrome (see archives RE 
defective &quot;Genuine Bosch&quot; parts), but it soon became obvious the problem went 
deeper than simply shoddy ignition components.  When the popping in the 
exhaust deteriorated into no power from #3 cylinder it was time for major 
surgery.  

I'll spare you the details of a couple of weeks of futile 
diagnostic/remediation efforts and simply say that ultimately the engine came 
out and was found to have major cracks in all 4 combustion chambers.  
Crankshaft endplay was well out of spec, and this case had had at least 3 
rebuilds that I could document with PO's records.  It was time to build a new 
engine.

In the absence of a readily available dual relief bus case an AK (Beetle) case 
was located that had never been rebuilt.  This was built up using new P&amp;Cs, 
new VW rods, new SP heads, and a carefully chosen rebuilt stock crank and cam. 
 The flywheel was resurfaced, a new clutch assembly installed, everything was 
tidied up and the tin repainted.  A brand new oil cooler was mounted using 
(surprise) new seals.  To accommodate the rear mount an improved adapter was 
installed that attaches not just to the oil pump cover bolts but also to a 
case-halves through-bolt.  All was stuffed back into the engine room, and it 
sure looked pretty.  On August 14 we were back on the road at last.

A great deal of care was put into breaking in the new engine and piling up 
miles so the valves could be re-adjusted and oil changed at around 400 to 500 
miles and dealing with any bugs so the camper would be ready for some serious 
people hauling over Labor Day weekend.  It seemed to be running a bit warm, 
and this was reported to the builder who offered assurances that all was well 
and the engine was just a bit tight pending completion of break-in.  The valve 
re-adjustment and oil change was done at 490 miles and all seemed well with 
the engine.

THE TRIP TO CATHERINE CREEK (OR) STATE PARK

Now for the messy part.....  With 1500 miles of break-in on the new engine I 
decided to
get in one real trip this year.  Friday AM 9-25-98 I headed out of Tacoma WA 
for Union OR and the WetWesties Catherine Creek State Park campout.  I took my 
time and stopped frequently to check engine temp. and oil level, both of which 
were just fine the whole trip until..........
