Subject: Re: brake bleeding sequence...

This Master Cylinder problem is driving me nuts...
Bentley sequence for bleeding is 
right front
left front
right rear
left rear

Is this correct? I've replaced the &quot;defective&quot; master cylinder, and
still have leakage from the front pinhole of the MC. What else can I
check? Front pads are new...Rear cylinders and shoes are new...
What am I missing... ?-(  Pedal still goes down half way before I get
resistance...
