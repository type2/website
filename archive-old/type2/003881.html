I went through this recently with my 70 bus. After a weekend of fiddling I
got to drive about 5 miles before my newly installed Sony CD player and
500watts of power took out my tired generator. It now happily plays with an
alternator and dual batteries.
Mounting the Sony required a little cutting of the edges of the opening with
a saber saw. But the benzel fit perfectly into the opening and is flush with
the dash pad. As far a cutting my suggestion would be take small cuts and
check often. And consider the power requirements of the stereo equipment you
use, gauge of wiring and placement of any amplifiers you may use.
