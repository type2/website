&gt; I belive this is a new discussion thread.  Hearing of
&gt; the &quot;bent frame&quot; incident has me thinking.  Were an
&gt; incident to take-out my T2, what is it worth?

there is a &quot;Green book&quot; (that is what it is called) similar to the
infamous &quot;Blue book&quot; that insurance agents use more often. I have found
copies at my local library and it is for &quot;older and historic collectors
cars&quot;  in the blue book my bus is worth about 200-500 dollars in the green
book it is worth $8,500  big diffference.  when they tried to total my bus
after a minor accident some years ago it was the green book that saved my
bus from being totaled.  As soon as I opened my mouth and said that &quot;I
have checked the green book&quot; they started working out the settlement, so
they know about it but the blue book must be the insurance settlement
folks and used car dealers book.

&gt; value of my vehicle?  Were my T2 to be totally
&gt; destroyed tomorrow, are we at the whim of Insurance
&gt; Adjusters?  As far as my Insurance company is
&gt; concerned, that &quot;total&quot; figure is $500 to $1000.  I
&gt; know.  I asked.  My agent has already warned me to
&gt; have the vehicle appraised when the refurb is
&gt; finished, to protect it's value; to protect my
&gt; investment.  Separately, I think some of us have heard
&gt; horror stories from Vintage Vehicle owners, recounting
&gt; the unrealisticly low Insurance Settlement offers
&gt; after &quot;totalling&quot; accidents.

you NEVER have to accept a settlement &quot;offer&quot; but the prochedure is quite
complicated to contest it, as Doc Tim would say, records records records,
record everything you do to your bus, every cent spent etc

&gt; In the next year or 2, (I presume) my T2 will be able
&gt; to sell for a high 4-digit figure, maybe even a low 5
&gt; digit figure.  It is my intention to get its value in

wow what are you doing to it,.???? those &quot;High&quot; numbers are the show
winners and trailer queens.

my bus has an &quot;assigned value&quot; insurance policy.  unfortunaately someone
on the list said the company I have my policy with is no longer offering
it to new customers....??
