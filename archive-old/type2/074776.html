Subject: Re: [T2] retractable seat belts

Al
I just did that very thing on my 76.  However, in 78 they did away with the  
steel backing behind the passenger and drivers seats on Transporters which is 
what I attached them to.  I mounted them without the cumbersum housing the 
mechanism is in. The mechanism is about the size of your fist. It must be 
mounted with the feed facing up...I imagine that it could be mounted on (and 
below) the same doorjam area that the top feeder you presently have is on.  
Probably drill 2 holes...one is for the set &quot;spike&quot; and one for the mounting 
hole, which you will have to anchor with a steel mollybolt.
Hope you understand all this...
Aloha
Jeff Raven
