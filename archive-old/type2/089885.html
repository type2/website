Subject: Re: [T2] Painting muffler

I don't want to be the bearer of bad news, but prep as you may, and
paint with what you want, the paint just isn't going to stick, on a
exhaust system.

Why?

Don't know.

The heat just turns the paint to dust after awhile and it will flake
off. ( even VHT )

The only thing I know of or am aware of that will stick to an exhaust
system is ceramic coating them, and this process isn't cheap.

Painting them with anything will give you short term results.

Have fun,

Terry

The Krylon website took me to Dupli-color. I bought the high heat 1200F
for exhaust headers. Followed the instructions for application and
drying time and after waiting for the last coat to dry I put the muffler
back on and took it for a drive to cure the paint. 
When I got back after 30 mins, the paint had bubbled on the side and
peeled on the bottom (both hot spots where the rust originally appears).
Pretty disappointed since I think I did everything right. Going to have
to remove it and sand it all down again and try another brand. Arg.
