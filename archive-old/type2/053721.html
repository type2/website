Subject: Re: Tow Bar Question

&gt; &gt; I am thinking of making a tow-bar for a bus that will easily connect up
&gt; &gt; without having to disturb the brake booster as some tow bars do.
&gt; &gt; Thinking of making it so I can just remove the front bumper and bolt
&gt; &gt; the tow-bar on at the two center front bumper connection points.  That
&gt; &gt; would space the tow bar arms about 21 inches apart, and would have
&gt; &gt; the 4 front bumper bolts holding in in place.  Does anyone see a
&gt; &gt; problem with doing it this way??  Ideas and/or opinions are welcomed.
&gt; &gt;
&gt;

When I bought Snoesje last year she was equiped with a tow bar. The brackets
are bolted directly on the bumper. I’m not sure if its the right place to
mount them - It’s giving a lot of stress to the bumper. But it worked to tow
her to my place. You will notice the mud on her nose from the 4x4 we used to
bring her to her new home. The picture was taken when I started to work on the
body - It’s work in progress...
