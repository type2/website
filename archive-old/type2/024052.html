Subject: oil out of dipstick tube???
Content-type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII

Hi Everyone -

I've looked through the archives and read a little about this, but I'm not
happy with nay explanation there.  My '79 2.0 runs great, compression are all
125-135 except cyl. 1 which is under 100.  When I drive on the flat land, bus
is happy.  

When I go up hills, my engine likes to push oil out of the dipstick tube!  Is
this normal?  What can be causing this?  It sure messes up nice clean heater
boxes when the oil catches in the fan and gets thrown right in there!

Thanks
Eric - '79 Westy
