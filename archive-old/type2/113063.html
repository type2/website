Subject: Re: [T2] oh, woe is me!

Well, they popped it back in and peened around the edges.  They're also 
going to check my oil-pressure relief valve to make sure that my oil 
pressure isn't getting to high.

This engine is only going to be in the car another month or so, so it's 
not really worth investing too much in it.  My newly machined case is 
having all the inserts taken out and replaced by Rimco.  That should 
probably be done by next monday!

I get my car back tomorrow!

&gt; The dreaded oil gallery plug strikes again!
&gt; 
&gt; I got to do one in January. Supposedly they are never suppose to come out -
&gt; but they all do eventually. Make sure it gets replaced with an NPT plug and
&gt; not just some JB Weld or some such crud...
