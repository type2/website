Hi Tim,
    I've dropped spark plugs into the cooling tin any number ot times over
the 20+ years I've been driving, and maintaining  VW buses.  Don't worr, you
can get the socket and plug out using a magnet.  Whereever you can buy auto
tools they will sell a magnet on the end of a long handle.  Mine has a
swivel joint where the magnet attaches to the handle.
    The real question is how to prevent this from happening again!  Now, I
only use the socket to initially loosen or final tightening of the sparky
plug.  To screw the plug out or in I use a piece of heavy wall automotive
heater hose that has a tight fit when pushed down over the top of the spark
plug.  With the hose there is no socket to fall off and on installation if
the plug threads get crossed you won't be able to strip them.
