  Just buy a new set of 34 pdsit's from CB Performance and be done with your
headaches for a few more years.

Subject: [T2] I hate my carbs


'72 stocker 1700cc  (32 pdsit 3/4's)

My mechanic refuses to work on them.  I cannot make the passenger side run
at idle any more, no matter how I adjust the volume control screw.  I took
them apart and looked for foreign matter or some other kind of problem.
They were pretty clean.   These are original, darn old.  The throttle body
has worn and the throttle valve doesn't seat well any more.  No way to fix
this really.  It isn't the shaft bushing.  This, I believe, is the source of
problem with my idle adjustment.  Also, the linkage is pretty worn, making
it hard to synchronize them.

Reading the stuff on the aircooled_dot_net website:   

&quot;...Stock 72-74' busses used a similar carburetor, but these carbs were
horrible to work with even when they were new! Only a masochist should
consider trying to adapt the bus carbs to some intakes you have lying
around.&quot;

OK.  I give up.  I want something good.

I am contemplating going with dual weber 40 IDF's or dual 34 ICT's.

Has anyone else used these?  
What is best?  Pro's con of each.  
I seek reliability and good gas mileage, my engine is in good shape - 150 -
155 PSI compression all around.  
I have the dual vacuum distributor, what are the implications here?  
Will I need to make a vacuum retart port?  
What about the vacuum advance port?  
Will I need a new distributor?

Thanks,

Bob H.
