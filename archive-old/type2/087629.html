&gt;I'm so happy. I gotta share this. *bay is awesome.

Well I always say it is, shame some pansy types don't think so.
FWIW I don't know how awesome $150 for a FI setup was, I mean
I guess but you could have done it from the right pick and pull for
$20 or so.  Still if it all works that is fair for what you got.

To anyone else watching there is a set of 1700 P&amp;C's on there now
for $85 start, $125 Buy it Now or something ridiculously reasonable
like that.  Or you could always pay your favorite list vendor $225 or
so.  The bay is the $hit for T4 parts IMHO, bearing sets, P&amp;C sets,
etc.  Watch and you will frequently find them for 1/2 vendor prices,
often German stuff.  Do searches for 914 as well folks, most people
list engine parts that way, thinking them Pooorsheees must be worth
more and all.  Just search 914, you'll get mostly Porsche 914 ads, then
do searches for like VW, pistons, piston, cylinder, heads, whatever.
Don't get in a rush, watch for a few months if you need to build an
engine someday coming up, I bet a T4 P&amp;C set sells every week on
there.
