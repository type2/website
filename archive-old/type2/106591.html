&gt;Hi Folks,
&gt;     I just thought I'd share with you something I've done to make
&gt;getting my starter in and out a little easier.  Any of you who have
&gt;removed and replaced your starter know what a PITA that upper bolt can
&gt;be.  Once you loosen the nut on the back end of it there's nothing to
&gt;keep the bolt from spinning, and that makes it hard to finish getting
&gt;the nut off.  And of course reinstallation is just as hard because the
&gt;bolt spins when you try to get the nut started.


The correct upper starter bolt has a &quot;D&quot; shaped head, the flat of which is 
locked by a corresponding flat in the starter housing, specifically to 
prevent the problem you describe. Stop by your nearest salvage yard and get 
the proper bolt.
