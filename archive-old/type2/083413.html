Subject: Re: [T2] heat exchanger &quot;rebuilding&quot;

&gt; metal reinforced wrap por15 now makes to wrap them up
&gt; in.  they would be nearly bullet proof after that and
&gt; you would never have to worry about them being rusted
&gt; from the outside.  i know one of the companies does

The wrapping will cause them to fatigue. Its just too much heat. Ive seen
it first hand. Mad Uncle Daves exhaust pipes were just flaking off
like french pastry.
