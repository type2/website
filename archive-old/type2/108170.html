Subject: Re: [T2] New Microbus

&quot;I like the looks of the bus.. I really like the dune car and the 'truck'
as well.
I shudder to contemplate the cost of the vehicle though.&quot;

I don't care for the bus, but the dune car could be fun--as  a dog owner, I
like the no fabric look, much easier to clean! But the
prices---aaacccckkkkkk!
I'll stick with the shepherdwagen!(my 71 Riviera)

faroe and the springfield crew
&quot;Keep watching, I might do a trick.&quot;
