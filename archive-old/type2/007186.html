Greetings and thank-you in advance

I've got a 75 1800 with factory air. Neither myself nor the PO have had it 
operational.
The first question is; Do they ever work? If so would it be worthwhile 
repairing? The PO says it's a matter of replacing the underdash sending unit 
and hooking up the belt which appears to be very difficult. I would 
appreciate any comments.
