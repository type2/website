Hey list, recently had a bit of a disaster with my pc. Lost my screensaver,
which was the photo of a “newer” Westy, desert setting, bikes on a rack, and
a rainbow in the sky over the van. It was a GREAT background. Anybody else
familiar with this photo, do you have any info on where the page is that
contains it?? I cannot find it any where on my harddrive.
Thanks for any help in advance.
Keith
81 Westy
