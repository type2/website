Well after approximately 8 years my bus may run again soon.  I owe it
all to you, masters. With only a few things left I'm actually getting
nervous!  What if......

Well, after 8 years (and not labeling a d*** thing) I can't remember how
to hook any thing up. I found the wiring diagram on Thom's page (see
library).  However, I remember a fused connection running over the fan
housing.  What is it?  Other quick pointers on wiring, breakin, busma,
etc. needed for the weekends work.

Thanks
