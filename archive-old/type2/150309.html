If the compression is ok, the engine sounds good and oil pressure is  
good you just probably just need to replace the heads. Engine mileage  
is another indicator.

&gt; What other things should I check for with the heads off?  Any  
&gt; articles out there concerning the specifics of changing the heads?

You need to make sure your exhaust seals to the heads properly:

As you increase bore size, you also increase the heat produced. Just  
keep that in mind...
