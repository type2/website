&gt; My $20 digital chinese made calipers from eBay just went haywire and I can't seem to fix it (battery, stuck buttons, etc). As soon as I turn it on the origin is set to some huge number. The same thing happens whenever I hit the origin button making measurement a math exercise.

get what you pay for

&gt; I'm going to replace it with a better brand name. Has anyone used one of
&gt; the newer IP66/67 coolant proof units? I'd like to hear some feedback if
&gt; you have any.

I'm an old fahrt I guess and don't like digital calipers, the pair I
bought from Sears 30 years ago still checks out as accurate to 4 decimal
places.  not outrageously expensive just decent quality.
