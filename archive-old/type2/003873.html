&gt; It is a huge piece of steel with a 46mm hex-shaped hole on one end and a
&gt; 1/2&quot; hole on the other. You stick a breaker bar in the little hole, the
&gt; Jesus nut that's holding the back wheel on in the big hole with the
breaker
&gt; bar off to the left side of this tool, then push down on the breaker bar
&gt; with your left hand and hit the tool (right above the breaker bar) with a
&gt; sledge hammer until the Jesus nut surrenders.
&gt;
&gt; It's called a Jesus nut because if it comes off while you're driving the
bus
&gt; down the Interstate, He's the next person you'll see.

Okay, I was just looking at those on someone's parts page. MMMMMM.
