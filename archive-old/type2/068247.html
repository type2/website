Subject: Busses Dying... ACS&amp;R?

Well, I went out to my local Bus Yard to get some parts the other day, and a
kid there told me to stock up, because pretty soon (2 weeks), some company
from California was going to come and take all of the trannys and motors and
&quot;parts&quot; (I don't know what that means)  Another company is coming from Mexico
to take all the Bug doors.  Then, breath deep, they are going to crush all of
the busses and cars, about 300 altogether.  Some very cool busses, a few
decent splitties, some even camper-types.  A lot of parts, windows, etc.  I
found a full tool set the other day.  Anyway, if anyone needs something,
parts are going pretty reasonably, but the guys are a little slow about it,
maybe they are just sad.   I am.  The place is called Lacey's VW, if you want
the number, email me.  This is a sad day....
