Subject: 2 liter valve adjust question

Hey Y'all,
The 78 deluxe Westy is now road worthy, so now its on
to body work and paint. Anyway, it seems to run out
pretty well but not quite perfect, so I was wondering
about the valves. Most all of my engine experience is
with uprights, but on the 2 liter, it has hydraulic
lifters, right?? So does this mean that valve
adjustments are never necessary?  It was an unknown
engine which had been sitting for a while, so do I
need to check and manually adjust the valves this
first time or should they be fine on their own??

Peace, John Baker
