&gt; My 73 Highroof finally runs like a top! Now after months of sweat i would
&gt; like to enjoy cruising to top 40. There is a radio in there though not
&gt; totally connected. All i know about audio is red is power, i hope. The red
&gt; line is going to an 8amp fuse. its a jensen and there are about 10 other
&gt; lines just hanging there. plus is doesnt turn on, i hvnt checked the inline
&gt; fuse yet though. any thoughts?

You may be in for a bit more sweat (or at least back pains), if you have
to sort out the spaghetti beneath the dash.  Essentially you'll have two
problems, their complexity depending on how much your wiring system has
been canabalized before you got to it.
1)Figure out which wires do what on the radio.
2)Figure out which wires do what on your bus.
After you've done that, it's a matter of connecting the appropriate
wires together.  This is assuming that your radio is, in fact, working.

The second part is probably easier, so I'll start there.  Check your
Bentley's for accuracy as my bus is currently not here (I'm working from
memory).  You'll need a power line and a ground.  Grounds are often
brown on a bus.  The power line on the bus typically comes from fuse 8
(the accessory fuse) and on mine was green.  Possibly green/black.  I
don't know if it was stock, though.  If you don't have a power line,
simply make one and plug it into the accessory fuse on the box.  You'll
also need to find speaker wires, but these are pretty obvious:  they're
usually a double wire going to the front doors (or whereever your
speakers are).

The first part will be a pain, if you don't have a manual for the radio.
 Red is often power, black is ground.  After that, it's all a chance. 
Look for pairs of wires, for example, white and white/black.  That's a
good sign that those are wires for the speaker hook-up.  Which one? 
Won't know until you plug it all in and play with the balance and fader.
 Chances are there's four pairs like that, for rt front, rt rear, left
front, left rear.  Got any wires left over?  One could be for the
illumination (possibly yellow? orange?).  This powers the lights on the
radio at
night and needs to be hooked up to the dash illumination string on your
bus.  Another might be for a power antenna (blue?).  BTW, you'll have to
find your antenna and plug that in.  One other wire you might have is
the constant power source if your radio has a clock or radio presets.  
Sometimes it is yellow. Or red/black. That you'll have to hook up to an
always-on hot source, or your clock will flash at you like a VCR.

How you figure out what goes to what is a matter of trial and error. 
Get the radio to turn on first, by hooking up power and a ground.  You
may also need to have the ignition lead hooked up as well, if your type of
radio has one.  Then test one speaker.  Hook it up.  Play with the
balance and fader.  If you don't get any sound after trying all extremes
of balance and fader, then you might have a bad speaker, bad speaker
cable, or the radio amp might be blown.  Hopefully none of those will be
the case.  After you figure out what the cables do, label them all, in
case you ever have to work on it again.

Good luck.  Hope this helps.
