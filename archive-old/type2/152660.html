Sam, there are really only two reasons to have parts replated. One is 
when replacement parts aren't available. That isn't a problem in this 
case. The other is if you are being fastidious about originality. This 
is rarely an issue with baywindow buses.

I would not trust anyone who gives an estimate over the phone. The 
process for rechroming is:

1) All the old plating must be removed. That usually means a layer of 
chrome, a layer of nickle, and a layer of copper. (Usually this occurs 
in a process identical to plating, only the polarity is reversed.)

2) The underlying metal must be worked smooth and repaired if need be.

3) The underlying metal then gets polished, plated with copper, then 
polished again.

4) Only then does the part get new plating with nickel, then chrome.

This is a lot of work, and part (2) can't be estimated without a visual 
inspection. I would not be surprised if this phone estimate were to 
double when you bring it in.

Chrome plating services are growing much more expensive because of 
environmental clean-up and new regulations.
