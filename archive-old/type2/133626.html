Subject: Re: Bus Boys Oil Cooler

I got one to protect my engine investment and couldn't be happier. My
engine builder welded a bracket in the frame in front of the left rear
axle parallel to the ground. I've had it in for a few months now and it
keeps my engine almost chilly. Unfortunately the thermostat didn't arrive
until after the installation so I need to still take care of that small
detail. The only problem is the cheap ass oil filter bracket that comes
with it. This cast piece of junk aluminum comes from Empi with a number
of pits in the casting so its literally impossible to keep it from
leaking. So I took it off and filed and sanded it down and it now seals
much better.

&gt; Subject: Bus Boys Oil Cooler
&gt;
&gt; '79 stock Westfalia with type IV.  I am considering installing a Bus
&gt; Boys remote oil cooler kit, part no. ZAP-11700 along with the oil
&gt; thermostat part no. 11780.  Has anyone had experience with this kit?
&gt; Is this quality equipment?  I am thinking of mounting the cooler above
&gt; the transmission.  Will this require a fan or is air turbulence
&gt; underneath the moving vehicle enough?  How are the hoses for this run?
&gt; underneath the engine?  Where is the oil filter mounted?  Bus Boys
&gt; claims no significant oil pressure drop.  Is this true?
