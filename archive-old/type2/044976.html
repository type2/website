Hey Art,

I just went through the same thing with my 77 2L and I don't know a thing
about the vanagon engine but with mine I had to rplace the rear fan shroud
thruogh which my dipstick tube runs. It was easy to find at a local used
parts place. I got mine for $20.00 fromBrax VW Divide Montana 406-267-3321.

Lood Gluck
