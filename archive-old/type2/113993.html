&gt;I just got a 70 double cab. I got an extra set of gates with it. A very

if you go to http://www.dropgates_dot_com

On the left there is an area titled TRUCK INFO:
three lines below that, click on YEAR CHANGES
then on the right hand side, click on SPECIFIC PART CHANGES
finally, click on DROPGATES, second row, middle photo.

That should get you the details of what year range gates that you have.

What ever you do, don't let anyone talk you out of them, they are worth some $$
