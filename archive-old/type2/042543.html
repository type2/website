Subject: Re: Replace the Starter...And She still wont Start

adam:
install a jumper wire at the ignition terminal on the starter.
strip 1/2 &quot; bare and slip under the spade terminal at the
solenoid and feed thru grommet in sheet metal at firewall
tin and over near battery, leave the other end exposed to
jump to battery hot terminal,bypassing the key ignition.

this is the essential part of the &quot;hot wiring&quot; technique which
could get you a free visit to Attica or Vacaville, if you also
included a direct connection to the ignition coil and solved
the steering lock problem  and car alarm of unattended cars...

since this connection will cause the starter to spin,
you must have the vehicle in neutral or park (if automatic)
and have the wheel chocked or the emergency brake on...
or both. it's still a lot safer than jumping the solenoid with
a screwdriver...

you have a problem with the ignition wiring . power goes
thru the start terminal in the electrical portion of your ignition
switch to the starter. a common failure of the ignition switch
occurs when, due to high resistance, heat melts those small
connections. you could find the plug under the column which
goes to the key, disconnect and test for power, even jump it
there. the other common problem is corrosion at the solenoid,
which you probably cure when you disturb the spade terminal.
