Here's the thing: I originally started out writing an m-code
decoder.  Then I thought: &quot;Hey, I should store this info if
I'm capturing it!&quot;

The problem is the fields  I'm collection and the translation
tables I've created are very &quot;split-centric&quot;

I've had a couple &quot;loafers&quot; interested in porting the code to
post '67; did LiMBO ever set up a real site?  Maybe we could
put it on type2_dot_com?

It's just a few perl scripts and text files with the translation
tables; one of you could probably do a much better job at the
whole task than a perl-novice like myself.

I didn't realise until it was too late that I'd CC'd the type2 list.

&gt; Hi Thom,
&gt; You'll have to start letting loafs register.  I was just at your site trying
&gt; to register and even had dug up my VIN, body #, and engine # before I got to
&gt; the year field and realized I couldn't register anyway!  You'll have to
&gt; include us type2_dot_com folk now that you've put out the invitation.  Right?
&gt; ;-)
