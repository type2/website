Subject: Re: [T2] CD ignition and the rotor

&gt; What is the function of that resistor in the circuit?  Has anyone had his
&gt; rotor fry from the use of a CDI?

I asked John Conolly about the resistor and he said it was for RF
suppression.(radio). I havent personally noticed a rotor going bad but I
hsvr heard from the folk whove been running CDIs for awhile that it will
breakdown the rotor resistor and make your bus run kind of crappy.
Im going to swap it this weekend and Ill see if I notice a difference.
As far as Bob Hoover. Maybe he didnt have enough time in the CDO operation
to see this problem.
