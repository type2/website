Subject: Re: [T2] Dwell on this

I know of several crane (or other) optical systems in use and none have 
dirt problems.  If your dizzie is getting that much dirt in it you have 
leaking seals or a bad cap. Heat is not a problem either as two of these 
engines are 400 plus cube engines with reworked everything to make 
furnaces out of them.  Biggest radiators and water pumps they could get 
are mounted.
  Optical is being used by one of the new european luxury vehicles but i 
dont remember which.  Its in a sealed nonrepairable by technician unit 
though.  Saw the write up in one of the tech mags we get at work.  A  
lot of the new luxury vehicles are being designed around &quot;modules&quot; now.  
supposed to make servicing easier.  being fought by third party vender 
companies because it also gives the dealer a lock on the parts market.

&gt; I do not like optical triggers. This is NOT the way to go. They work, 
&gt; but look at your engine compartment, look at the dizzy. This is a dirty 
&gt; place, and optical sensors get fouled by dirt and grime. Heat also 
&gt; affects them to some degree. Avoid optical, and go with magnetic fields.
