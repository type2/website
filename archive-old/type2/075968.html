Subject: Re: [T2] solid/hydraulic swap?

Al,
There are actually 14 different profiles of stock cams for the TIV engines.

They range from the automatic trannied vehicles, to smogged 914s. The cam
for a very rare automatic 91`4 was also it's own. Web cam located all the
cam cards for us, the differences in the cams are not much, mostly lift and
lobe center changes.

 There were only 4 of these really used in busses. The automatic cams have
two raised lines just outside the center journal that go all the way around
the cam. The non autos do not have this.

Getting back to the root of the conversation, if you change lifters you must
change cams, no matter what the profiles. The hardness of each must match or
you WILL have troubles. I have 4 pages almost done for my site that shows
the disasters of non matched cams.

Of all the things I had to get bitten by when learning, the cams were the
worst. Since we have changed to WEB CAM for AL our cams and matching lifters
the problems have been ZERO. next month will make 4 years since we swapped
to them the extra cost of the product is more than worth it.

&gt; Stan, Jake:
&gt; Actually, there are 3 profiles.
&gt; 1.The original 411 profile, which was used in all Porsche 914's and 912E's
as
&gt; well as 72 and 73 type 2's with manual transmissions(can't remember about
the
&gt; 74 and 75)
&gt; 2.The softer mechanical cam developed for the automatic 73 type 2's. This
&gt; engine developed 62 hp as compared to the 66 hp developed by the stick
&gt; camshaft in 73.
&gt; This cam was also used in all 76 and 77 engines.
&gt; 3.The hydraulic lifter camshaft , which has the same basic timing specs as
&gt; #2, and was fitted to type 4 engines in 77-83 type 2's and Vanagons.
&gt; All hot rodders probably have had it drummed into their heads (since
Hector
&gt; was a pup) that mechanical lifter cams are ground with clearance ramps
built
&gt; in to take up the clearance. Hydraulic lifter cams do not have this
feature.
&gt; Having said all this, apparently it works just fine to run the hydraulic
&gt; lifters on the mechanical cam. (It is not tested to do the opposite). The
&gt; hydraulic lifter does not seem to object to the clearance ramps.
&gt; The Chevy crowd also has access to something called Rhoads lifters, that
vary
&gt; the duration according to the oil pressure, I believe. I also believe that
&gt; they are made to be used on mechinal lifter camshafts, as well.
&gt; Karl (who is a real Mercedes mechanic and gold prospector, and genuinely
&gt; exists, according to Steve Dolan and others) has tested this combination
MORE
&gt; THAN ONCE. And for many tens of thousands of miles. (Re his own hooey
posting
&gt; earlier today.)

&gt; &gt; I've been yelling this at list members for about a year. They keep
