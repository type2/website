&gt; If you think about it, water (H2O) when broken down has two parts hydrogen
&gt; which burns very well and one part oxygen which helps support a flame or
&gt; burn, and with high combustion chamber temps, doesn't the water brake down
&gt; like it would under electrolisis (sp?)?

Woo, bad science!

Water is certainly hydrogen combined with oxygen, but they are combined
because this is a lower energy state.  You have to put energy in to
separate them, such as the electric current used in electrolysis.  If you
break them apart and then immediately recombine them you will get the same
energy back that you put in!

Water injection reduces the peak temperatures to prevent detonation.  It
also expands very well when vaporized, _but_ you have to put in the energy
to vaporize it!

No free lunch!
