&gt;I've wondered why it's black letter on black when the Bentley shows black

The Bentley is showing the original scale which is made out of METAL and 
painted white with black numbers.  Rare to see one of those with the 
numbers still visible on it.  They should have put notches in it!


&gt;Also why does it say &quot;nach&quot;? My german-english dictionary says this mean
&gt;after. Do some timing scales say &quot;vorher&quot;?

Yes, it means after.  Just plain &quot;vor&quot; would indicate before (TDC).  Maybe 
they didn't have room for both words?  I dunno.
