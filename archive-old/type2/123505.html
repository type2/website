&lt;&lt; Ok 

I can t seem to find this on the net  What is the name of the fringe
(tassels maybe?) which hung from the ceiling (windshields) in Southern
California cars, 1960 s &amp; 1970 s?

Thanks,



Tom &gt;&gt;

Dingleberry was the scatological term used around here... You might
try Googling around &quot;Low Rider&quot; to get the real name...
