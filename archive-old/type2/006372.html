I know what VW recommends for gear oil changes, I have a half dozen factory
and aftermarket manuals with that data.  But R&amp;Ring transaxles is a real
pain and they're expensive too.

So...  I personally do a gear oil change at least annually.  Unnecessary
expense?  Perhaps, but it's pretty cheap insurance.

There's very little in the way of preventative maintenance that's actually
detrimental to a machine, and if increasing the frequency of a procedure
adds a little expense it's still way ahead of the alternative.

FWIW.....

YES. I always change it when I buy a used vehicle if over 100,000 miles
or 10 years old. Worn-out tranny oil will allow the gears to wear more than
they should, an ugly spiral. Change it now, and you'll be impressed
at how much better the synchros work too!

&lt;&lt;  I notice that the transmission is hard to shift when I first start
up, but it gets easier as it warms. Does that suggest I should dump the old
oil?  &gt;&gt;
