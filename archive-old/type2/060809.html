&gt;&gt; Tom Connor, the guy from Deer Park, Washington who makes the nice
custom and/or reproduction racks and ladders finally has an e-mail
address.  If all goes well with his time and computer he'll probably be
joining the Lists. 

Tom's e-mail address is:    racks_at_ior_dot_com 

.....If you want a rack, talk to Tom.  You won't regret it. &lt;&lt;

Hey! 

I got your message.  Thanks for the confidence in my racks.  It was nice
talking to you and having a new EMail friend.  By the way, I just got a
Thing and boy does it need some new parts ( or used).  If you know
anybody who has a front nose clip (ouch!) mine needs one BAD.  I'll even
trade a rack for one.

Talk to you later,

Tom Conner
