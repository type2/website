Subject: Re: [T2] tires for my bus

&lt;&lt; looking to replace my white wall tires on my bus and i am asking the list 
what brand of white wall tires should i get and how are the prices at 
coker_dot_com  &gt;&gt;

Does Coker carry the reinforced sidewall tire that the Bus requires...
White wall or not...Even at their hefty prices...?-(
From what I gather on other lists, Coker is for &quot;collectable&quot; or show
car owners who want correct or period tires...Street cars are probably
better off using modern tires (J. C. Whitney probably still carries white
wall inserts. tho' ... ?-)
