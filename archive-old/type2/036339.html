+AD4-I was surprised at bus folks non-concern for exhaust emissions when I
+AD4-entered the VW world.  I figured all the hippies would have environmental
+AD4-sensitivity on the top of their list.  Then again I guess I'm young and
+AD4-stupid.


Actually you can make a quite good case for the environmental friendliness
of a well maintained bus.

The actual emissions which are generated when a new vehicle is manufactured,
that is from the steelworks, the power station, etc take quite a few miles
to make up, even if the engine runs cleaner. If you can keep an old vehicle
on the road a few extra years, this may well be better than scrapping your
car and buying new every 7 years, the typical life of most vehicles.

Mind you, I'm not so sure that old VW's are any more long lasting than any
other, it's just that they made more in the first place, so they are dying
out slower.
