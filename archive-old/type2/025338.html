I've got a 1972 Riviera and I've no need of the storage box/seat that sits
behind the driver facing the rear.  It's in pretty good condition and has
the cushioned seat/lid as well as the back cushion.  The back cushion has
lost a couple of it's snaps on the vinyl piece that holds it on.  There is
no clasp or lock for the little cupboard behind the back, but the cushion
itself holds it closed.  The inside outlet is attached but I believe the
wiring has been removed.  Dunno.

Anyway, we're in Capital Hill, and if anyone wants it, it's yours.  If you
feel like making a donation to the 'keep Russ alive' fund, it's always
appreciated but not necessary.

Let us know!
