Subject: Re: [T2] 78 Westy 2.0L engine weak fire

        The temp sensor II per Bently says at 68F it should read about
2500 ohms, if considerably higher or lower then replace. Before the
weather turned cold it read 2486 ohms. If you find the warm reading to be
0 please let me know. My Bently is old.

Thanks
Ralph
