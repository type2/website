&gt;Ok, So i still have this noise (i have been thinking lately that it is a 
&gt;pinging and not a knocking that i thought it was ealier(how do you tell 
&gt;the difference between the two))

A knock generally will progress very quickly. Pinging will subside if you 
adjust a bit richer and/or back off the timing a few degrees.

&gt;I think that the engine is  maybe EA.

EA is a Porsche code.

i noticed that one of the bolts on the rocker arm for cylinder 4 was loose. 
i went ahead and started tightening it and it wouldnt get tight. now it 
wasnt really lose or anything but it wasnt tight either. where should i go 
from here. and why isnt the bolt getting tight?

The treads are pulling out. Try a helicoil or better, a timed insert. The 
tools to do this aren't cheap, like you admit too, so the only other course 
is to keep running it till something breaks, which will cost even more than 
fixing it right now.

&gt;  but i am fed up with this damn thing. And im too stuborn to take it in 
&gt; to someone and pay them to fix it. I want to fix it! (and im cheap! :-)

If you invest less than what is necessary to actually fix it, you will need 
more time/money than less. Looks like you will find out just how smart you 
are about being &quot;cheap&quot;. Pay whatever is required to fix it properly right 
now, or pay several times that much to fix it after it breaks.

&gt;Oh yeah. one more question while i have your attention. the deflector 
&gt;plates that go under the cylinders, Is that there for cooling?? of just to 
&gt;keep rocks and stuff from hitting the pushrod tubes?

Both!!!
