Subject: Subject: Re: [T2] Timing Vacuum vs Mechanical 

Hi Mike:

Sorry for the delayed response to this thread, I'm catching up.

Mike Dwyer wrote the stuff quoted below, but what really caught my eye
was the part that went: &quot;...  That is why you can time a combination vac
and mech unit to a total advance of 38 - 40 degrees BTDC and a Mech only
unit to 30 - 32 degrees BTDC at full advance.&quot;

The problem is, after re-reading this a few times, I still don't see why
you can time the mech/vac to a higher total advance.  Are you saying
that the 'extra' eight degrees of advance is ok because it is in effect
when you are timing the engine but not when you are cruising at highway
speed?

I have asked the list this question a couple of times over the last five
years or so, and never gotten an answer that got through my thick head;
so I hope you'll be willing to say something more to the list about
this.

If it is the type of distributor (i.e. mech/vac instead of mech only)
that allows the higher total advance and not the type of engine (i.e.
type 4 instead of type 1/2/3), then why didn't the vac/mech equiped type
1/2/3 powered cars get higher total advance also ... or can they also
have a higher total advance?  BTW, just to make sure I'm on the same
wavelength, when you say &quot;total advance of 38-40 degrees BTDC,&quot; you do
mean that when I pull the throttle with my right finger and the trigger
on the timing gun with my left finger I should see the notch advance up
to 38-40 on the scale, yes?  (and this would explain why the scale in
fact does go up to 40 degrees BTDC, hmm?)

Mechanical total advance is what you have under full load full throttle
conditions.  In this state, you will have 0 vacuum.  If you also have a
vacuum
advance connected, at full load and full throttle with 0 vacuum, only
the
mechanical advance is in play.  The vacuum advance adds in timing
advance at
light load conditions resulting in increased fuel economy and a cleaner,
more
complete burn.  That is why you can time a combination vac and mech unit
to a
total advance of 38 - 40 degrees BTDC and a Mech only unit to 30 - 32
degrees
BTDC at full advance.  More:
The grade and quality of the fuel you use impacts the total advance you
can
run.  Adjust your distributor by making full throttle 3rd gear test runs

listening for ping.  Advance timing slightly, make test run.  continue
to
advance until ping appears, then back off a few degrees to be under the
ping
point of your engine.  Disconnect and plug the vacuum hoses if equipped
before
making this adjustment.  There are so many variables even from the
factory,
(compression, mixture, plugs, etc.) that the factory specification is
usually
just a starting point and it is up to us to find the optimum timing
setting for
our own engines.

Keep smiling,

Mike
