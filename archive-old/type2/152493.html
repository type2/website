Subject: Re: [T2] 1965 Beetle front wheel aligment problems

Roberto,
If both tie-rods are adjustable then the total length of left + right
tie-rod has to remain the same to keep the car aligned - assuming it
was aligned before. BUT

As far I I know from my reading of Muir Beetles have no drag link, so
the centering of the steering box may be achieved via adjusting the
length of the left/right tie-rods. (Beetle expert please correct me).
If you add one inch on one side and remove one inch on the other side
and your steering box was centered BEFORE, it won't be centered AFTER.
I don't quite understand what it mechanically means to run a centered
steering box, but I do know how it feels: there is a harder spot in
the middle. I would recommend you to ensure that your steering box is
centered with your new tie-rods.

If the steering box is in shape and adjusted, you can feel the center
point by lifting the front wheels and turning the wheel until you find
that about 15 degrees of harder steering. You want to be within these
15 degrees while you drive straight. To achieve this on a bus we
adjust the drak link length. On a beetle I guess you adjust the tie
rod lengths.

- Arnaud

&gt; bentley manual sais that the length of the shorter tie-rod after install
the
&gt; both ends must be set at 12.8&quot; and mine before dissasemble was about 11.8&quot;
&gt; and the other tie-rod was set an inch longer to compensate is my guees.
&gt; By know I decided to set the tie-rod to the length espedified by the book
