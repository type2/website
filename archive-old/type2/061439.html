Subject: Baffled by brake bleeding

Hi Volks,

After trials and tribulations, studing the H-M-B threesome of manuals and
the Arch*ves, I can't seem to cure my spongy brake pedal.  Here is the
story.  Subject is the Turtle, 1970, stock drums all around.  I have
replaced all shoes, front and back, wheel cylinders, rubber hoses, and rear
drums.  All went well until it came to bleeding brake fluid.  I have gone
around the bus rear to front many times, used every method recommended in
the manuals, brought the 3/16 vinyl hose up and over the tire, and in the
process I have flushed thru 3, yes 3 Qts. of brake fluid.  I get no more air
in the hose, fluid runs clear.  I have adjusted all wheels to tight minus
2-3 clicks on the adjusters.  But still, as in the beginning, the pedal goes
to the floor but pumps up to firm with 3-4 stabs of the brake pedal.  Sure
seems like air in the line, but where?  Don't know if it's a clue, but the
pedal bottoms out at the floorboard when a rear bleeder is open, but stops
hard about 2&quot; above the floor when a front bleeder is open.  I find no
evidence of a leak anywhere.  I am embarrassed by how long this brake job
has taken.  Help!
