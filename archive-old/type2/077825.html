Subject: Re: [T2]  Need more power: Alternator Upgrade.

Kymco sells a 75 amp alternator that nobody ever says anything bad about.  I've also heard of people finding ways to install Delco alternators in busses.  Have you replaced the factory wiring in your bus?  It'll be an issue if you're putting in a big stereo.

&gt;&lt;pre&gt;I have a 74 Bay, with a 1641 Big Bore. I am in the middle of installing 
&gt;a seriously big entertainment system. During a few test runs I have managed 
&gt;to fry the standard 55amp alternator. I have a 90 amp hour battery and intend 
&gt;to install a second in order to give the system enough umph. I now need 
&gt;to replace the alternator and am thinking of going for a 75 or 90 amp thing, 
&gt;has anyone ever done anything like this before and would like to pass on 
&gt;thier invaluable knowledge to me.
