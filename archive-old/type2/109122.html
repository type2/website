Subject: [T2] RE: Parts ordering experience w/ 4 vendors

&gt;I'll be the first to admit that sometimes we screw up an &gt;order. But this
&gt;simply isn't one of them. Where is the problem?

First off I would like to say that I personally have not ordered anything from
Bus Depot. So you might be thinking what can I have to say being I have not
ever used their service. Well I am blessed in the fact I have an awsome
VW/Imports supplier here where I live. I seldom have to order your everyday
regular parts thru the mail. What I would like to add to this thread is that
BD serves its community to its fullest, The owner is a member of this list and
gives its members a 5% discount. Now how many other big VW parts suppliers can
you say that about. Not a one I can think of. Also if driving your &quot;slow get
there when I get there&quot; bus hasn't taught us all a little patience then your
in the wrong hobby. Plan ahead order your parts weeks in advance to the job. I
know I double the expected time a job takes when planning it because nothing
ever goes perfect according to planning. For emergancy quick jobs let them
know and if you want quicker than lightspeed service expect to give up a
little more dough. All I hear is &quot;blah blah blah blah me me me me&quot; no one has
said anything about what a great job BD does on giving back to the ones that
support it. Well let me be the first to say Thank you to BD for filling the
gap in PERSONAL service that differs largly from those west coast corps. that
think of nothing but how they can fill their pockets with more of your
$$$$$......With that said I will gratefully step down from the soap
box.....CHAD
