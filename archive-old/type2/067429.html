Hi Y'All,

Rented &quot;The Arrival&quot;, a movie about aliens starring Charlie
Sheen.  A &quot;mutt&quot; of a beetle prominently shown - green. And, about a '74
stock Type II as well.

Also, &quot;X-Files&quot; Sunday night showed a yeller beetle (about a 67)

John A.

The Bug in the X-Files was atleast a 68 because of the style of the
taillights, and I believe I remember seeing the airducts behind the quarter
windows signifying that it was at least a 71, which would mean then
that it was a 71 or 72 Bug...but it was quite nice...
