first off, thanks to everyone who has responded.  you can all probably tell
that i'm a severe newbie to all of this, so thanks for treating me so
graciously.
here's the scoop:  my carb needs new gaskets and linkage(rusted horribly).
the only problem is that it's not a VW carb.  it's a Holley.  i'm not sure
if this is a good thing or not, but it's all i've got so it's gonna have to
work.  where would i be able to get gaskets and linkage for it???  also, one
of the throttle flap things is crusted shut.  what can i do about this??
it's not all gummed up, so i'm hoping i can salvage it.  i'm guessing it
just sat a little too long.  it's not rusted, just crusty (the only way i
can describe it).  will i be able to salvage it??  please tell me yes,
because i'm kind of low on cash.  TIA.
