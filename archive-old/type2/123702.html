Subject: Hydraulic lifters - mistake to replace?

Hi all,

As many do, my '79 2.0L Hydraulic has a couple lifters that are very
noisy when the bus isn't started every other day.  REALLY noisy.  I've
read the articles on type2_dot_com but was curious for more info.  I know
with solid lifter motors just replacing the lifters isn't necessarily a
good idea because the lifters wear with the cam, and new lifters may not
match the cam hardness, etc. etc. resulting in an eventual waste of
money as the engine is on the way to a rebuild anyhow.

With the Hydraulic lifters, would I be making a mistake to invest the
time and money to replace all the lifters to shut the motor up, or
should I just live with the noise on startup and go for a rebuild in due
time?  I guess the nature of the Hydraulic lifters prevents cam wear,
but what about when they are failing?  I guess I'm curious as to others'
experience in the lifter department.

At 10-15 bucks a pop it doesn't seem like a huge investment to go ahead
and replace all 8.  What do you folks think?  Thanks in advance,

-Ross
