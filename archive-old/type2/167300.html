Subject: Center main bearing thickness

Does anyone happen to have a 1600 center main bearing laying about? . 
25/.50? And a caliper?  Need the thickness.  I just attempted to  
assemble a friend's lower end and it REALLY appears that the center  
main in the set is mismarked. (I measure it at .210/.211 thickness.)

TIA.

Jim
