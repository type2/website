Subject: Re: [T2] Ign. Switch replaced, now starter failing

While it's likely an electrical problem, you may also consider the starter
bushing.  

I once bought a beetle cheap from a mechanic who couldn't chase down the
&quot;ground&quot; problems.  It bump started and ran great but he couldn't get it to
start with the new starter, battery or bypassing the switch at the starter.

I put a $0.39 bushing in it and was off and running.

Just a thought,
