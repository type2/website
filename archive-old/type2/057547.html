Scott Bogon raises and important issue

After the work I have done on ECUs, I feel I can comment.  When
Bosch made the ECUs for VW, the English language DLL they used
was licenced to the year 2010, however, this was prepared in
COBOL.  Compter-literate people will remember that COBOL is
one of the packages that would only allow 2 digit dates.

This means that ANY English-language outputs from the ECU will fail
in the year 2000 in stock VWs using them.  My German is no good,
but someone else can work out what the German translation of
&quot;Squirt fuel NOW!&quot; would be. You won't get English commands any
more.  I think the problem with MY CPU is that the date as
progressed too quickly and &quot;HALT&quot; keeps beeing fed out of the CPU
to the rest of the engine.

Hope this helps the list - have a good weekend.
