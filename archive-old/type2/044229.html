&gt;&gt; Here's the biggest question...the kicker:

&gt;&gt; Can I expect that a type 2 in good running order will make it form my

&gt;
&gt;a type 2 in &quot;good running order&quot; can go just about anywhere.  I drove my
&gt;65 across the country and back many years ago and drive my 78 just about
&gt;everywhere.-

Go for it! I've had busses since 1974 and gone everywhere- US and Europe.
I'm not saying you won't have problems along the way.  That is the charm of
VWs, they very rarely leave you alongside the road. Most problems can be
fixed alongside the road, if not you can make the next shop on three or even
two!
