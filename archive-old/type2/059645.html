&gt;&gt;'79 FI 2.0L westy, bone stock.  Just got the fresh AVP rebuild running
&gt;&gt;after the oil cooler fiasco.  Can't get enough advance out of the
&gt;&gt;distributor.  When I rotate the distributor for advance, the vacuum
advance
&gt;&gt;hits up against the cold start valve.  Apparently, the good folks at AVP
&gt;&gt;installed the distributor drive shaft in a different position than it
&gt;&gt;originally was.
&gt;&gt;What are my options here?  Can the drive shaft be
&gt;&gt;repositioned a tooth?
&gt;&gt;How hard is this to do in the car.  How do you get
&gt;&gt;the shaft out?  How do you keep from loosing the spacer washers in the
&gt;&gt;case?

The caution given by David Schwarze is certainly warranted, but I suggest
you do it.  I dropped the thrust washer into the engine and it was not easy
to get out - and I was lucky.  However, you have to try hard to knock it
into the engine.  I did it trying to lift it out which was unnecessary.
Anyway, I found that my dist had been put in in the wrong position by the
reconditioners.  It was easy to reposition it one notch.  Getting the drive
shaft out may be difficult.  They say a strong magnet can do it.  I did it
the WRONG way by starting the engine without the dist bolted down.  It all
popped out, but that's another story.  If you are able to lift the shaft
enough to turn it, it is likely that the washer won't move enough to
obstruct the reentry of the shaft.  However, if it does, just lift the shaft
out, look down the hole and you will see the shaft hole, and the washer on a
little shelf, slightly overlapping the hole.  Then get a long thin
screwdriver and carefully place it down the shaft hole through the washer
and into the hole.  Now the washer cannot go anywhere while you use a piece
of wire to tap it into its precise location neatly around the hole without
overlapping the hole.  Take out the screw driver, (oil should be holding the
washer in place as long as you don't touch it) and slide the drive shaft
down.  the Drive shaft is a snug fit so you can't push the washer sideways
with you trembling hand.  Obviously you should note the drive shaft's
position when lifting it, so you can insert it in as close to the new
position as possible.  I would insert it say 5-10 degrees further round in
the desired direction, until you hit bottom (the teeth) then gently rotate a
bit more till you feel it want to slip into some teeth.
