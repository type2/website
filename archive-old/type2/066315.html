My books list the following sizes for the 30 PICT 1 on a T-2:

Main jet: 115, 117.5,&amp; 120
Air correction jet: 135z
Pilot jet: 55 &amp; 60

It does not look like the problem is your main jet. Your carb is a little rich, 
but this should not make you run hot. An over-sized air correction jet will lean 
you out, and this can cause you to run hot.

You note 2300 miles on the engine. New rebuild? What is your CR? Your rings 
may have worn in and setted, raising the effective CR. What signs give you the 
indication you are running hot?

I run the same engine/carb set-up that you have in my '61 and use 120 main, 55 
pilot, and 144 air correction jets in mine. I also note that I run hotter with 
cheap fuel. What octain do you feed it?
