Hey, if your looking for motivation to head up to the Canadian Rockies 
yet this year, check out some of these pictures I took last week.
(These were all done with a QuickTake, so quality is good for the 
screen at least.)

Anyway, page is still being roughed in, but the pictures are all there 
now, at:
