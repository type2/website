Subject: RE:  [T2] Catch-22 / Can't open Slider

The situation::

 &gt;   '69 Westy,
 &gt;   put a tall can of Pledge (tm) in &quot;there&quot;, and closed the slider.   The 
inside handle can't move forward.
 &gt;   Can't open the slider anymore.


Help, people.

How about loosening the ice box clamps behind the passenger seat.  Loosen 
the ice box/sink cabinet enough to release the Pledge

How can the door (a '69 van) be released from the rear??  Can he just unbolt 
something so the door will kick out at the rear??
