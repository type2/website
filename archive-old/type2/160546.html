Subject: Re: [T2] Yet another Not-a-new-bus

You must be right. They must have all retired, and my friend must have been
talking about engineers in the old days. A member of the Chico VW club works
at a Mercedes repair shop and said even their stuff is junk these days. A
long way from the Mercedes that carried one of the German generals around on
the eastern front - can't remember who, maybe Von Luck - and was praised by
him as a worthy machine.
