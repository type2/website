Subject: Trip Report, Now it won't start!!!

I took my first extended trip this weekend, a trans-NY trip for midsemester
break.  It was extremely windy and sorta cold.  The bus &quot;ran&quot; great.  After
4 hours I stopped to refuel and the bus would not start (would not turn over).
Push started it and it ran fine, nothing to indicate its lack of starting.
I got pulled over on I-90 for weaving.  I explained to the cop that the bus
was getting blown all over the place.  He said OK, gave me a push to get me
started and I finished my trip with no problems.
So now I am trying to find out what is wrong with my bus.
I charged the battery and it started right up.
I made the whole trip with my headlights on, windshield wipers mostly on, and
heater fan on.
The lights dimmed and brighted from time to time as usual.
The battery light never came on.
My bus is a '77 with a 2 liter, FI engine.
There doesn't seem to be any shorts (there was no sparks when I connected
the battery).
The headlights seemed really bright even though it did not have enough
power to turn the starter.
I suppose it must be my alternator of voltage regulator (hopefully the later)
What do you experianced people think it might be?
What tests can I perform?
How much is a voltage regulator?
I already have an extra alternator from a '73, will it work on my '77?
I suspect changing the alternator is a pain in the but, is that true?
Thanks for your help,
Brett
