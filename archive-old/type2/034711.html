&gt; there any words of wisdom from the list? I liked what someone said awhile

I have found that my 2L likes 89 RON octane

&gt; not sure yet if its a 1.7 or 1.8.

not me, I use only Synthetics (after the 3,400 mile break in)

1. start run 15 minutes, change oil &amp; filter (10-40 Sunoco ultra)
2. drive 100 miles, change oil &amp; filter
3. drive 300 miles, change oil &amp; filter
4. drive 1,000 miles, change oil &amp; filter
5. drive 2,000 miles,
 flush engine, torque heads, check points plugs etc.
 top off with 5-50 synthetic and new filter.

go to regular maintenence schedule 

&gt; secrets out we may be looking at the flawless 200,000 mile air-cooled!! This
&gt; is my 2nd VW but my first rebuild and I want to leave nothing to chance!

1,700 engines had slightly higher CR and ran a little bit hotter,  1,800
seemed to be odd engine out,  whats the odds of getting it rebuilt as a
2liter,  same block (different crank, rods, P&amp;C, heads etc, but your
getting those anyway right)

keep the Fuel Injection.

my opinion, nothing more, ya get what you pay for
