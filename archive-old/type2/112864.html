Subject: Re: [T2] A friend in need

1.) Warm motor.  Shut down motor. Liberally spray penetrating oil on 
stuck plugs. (WD-40 is *not* penetrating oil. Kroil, Liquid Wrench, 
Chrysler/GM heat riser lubricant is.) Let engine cool. Spray again.  
Remove plugs. Loosen a bit, spray, tighten a bit, loosen a bit more, 
lather, rinse, repeat.  Slow and easy.  Worst case scenario: You pull 
the threads, but the motor needs to come out anyway. Easy fix with the 
motor out.

2.) Valve clearance and ignition timing are unrelated issues. '77 has 
solids, not hydraulic lifters. Check for .006/.008 all around.

3.) 60# compression is a valve seat or a valve failing. The head needs 
to come off.

If you friend is willing to get dirty, the fix could be done for a 
couple hundred dollars.  If not, $1000 isn't out of the question.

Good luck.

Jim

&gt;Four months later is was taken into the shop again and another valve
&gt;adjustment was done because it wasn't holding it's timing. Since the timing
&gt;is off after only 2 more months I figure the heads are truly in bad shape
&gt;but I don't have further compression data.
&gt;
&gt;The repairs were done for a reasonable price but unfortunately the problem
&gt;persists and the original cost of the bus was expensive. He was quoted $1300
&gt;to repair the problems but this will skyrocket the cost of the bus and it
&gt;will be average and need a lot of other work. A new AVP engine is only $1100
&gt;right?
