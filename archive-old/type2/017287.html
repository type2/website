I too had problems w/ the fuel gage to Bullwinkle.  The solution was to replace
the 'voltage stabilizer' .  This is a 2 terminal device that is bolted to the back
of the speedometer. It's function is to provide a constant voltage source for the
fuel gage. The easiest way to gain access to it is to remove the 4 screws that
hold the instrument cluster to the dashboard and also remove the speedometer
cable.  You can now tilt the inst. cluster forward and voila - straight shot to
the voltage stabilizer.  BTW a new voltage stabilizer unit is fairly expensive
(~$40 I think),  however if you have a local junk yard, you should be able to get
one cheep (my yard had a perfectly good unit for only $3.00 - the ultimate in
recycling!).

&gt; My fuel gauge only ever shows completely full or empty, and this indication

&gt; searched the archives for a wiring diagram as I suspect a faulty connection or
&gt; short somewhere.
&gt;
&gt; There were some excellent posts about cutting a hole in the van to access the
&gt; fuel sender unit but I'd rather avoid that if i can!!  So if anybody can tell
&gt; me where the wiring goes whilst on its way to the dashboard gauge I'd be most
&gt; gratefull.
