&gt;...If I disconnect the distributor, so no spark will be produced, and it

&gt;best word I can use to describe it.  Chirp might be  another.  It is definitely 
&gt;more than a click of loose valves that need  adjustment.
&gt; 
&gt;Any thoughts anyone?

I realize I am &quot;ringing in late&quot; here, but what the heck.  Jeremy, have
you preformed a compression test lately?  If so, was the squeaking
side compression low compared to the quiet side of the engine?
Try a valve adjustment (even hydraulic lifter engines need a valve
adjustment occaisionally) and retest the compression.

I heard the squeak/cricket chirp coming from my engine in '87,
and the noise was from compression leaking out between the
cylinder and head.
