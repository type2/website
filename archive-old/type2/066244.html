The elecromagnetic cutoff prevents fuel from flowing to the carb when 
the ignition shuts off.  Run a hot wire from the black wire on the 
distributor to the EM Cutoff device.  Unless there is power to it you 
will get VERY little if any fuel.  You only want power to it when the key is 
turned on. BTW, Check the threads in the carb, if the EM 
device has stripped the threads, fuel will leak, posing a potential fire 
start location.
You should be able to hear the EM valve audibly click as power is 
turned on &amp; off.  If it isn't, check for power and for proper 
grounding through the carb to the engine.  Plastic spacers under carbs 
can sometimes interrupt ground path.  Usually some other grounding 
path is provided through some other carb component.

The auomatic choke also needs power when the key is on.  The longer 
the key (power) is on, the more open the butterfly valve opens.  
Before the key is first turned on the BF valve should be fully closed.  
There should be a few screws holding the outer housing of the choke 
assembly to the carb.  Loosen the screws to rotate the housing to get 
the valve to be closed when cold (no power).   A nuisance, but if you 
have been playing with it, let it get stone cold before adjusting it. 
 
I had lots of experience with these components on my dual carb '67 
sqbk. (Oh how I wish I had time/money to get it running again)

&gt; In another window I've been searching the vanagon archives 
&gt; and saw a message from wabbott where he describes the electromagnet cutoff.  Mine is installed but 
&gt; not hooked up.  What do I connect it to?  I have the automatic choke hooked up but don't really know 
&gt; how to adjust it.  Is the wire connected to the auto choke supposed to always carry +12V when the 
&gt; key is on?  Or is this wire supposed to go the cutoff. --
