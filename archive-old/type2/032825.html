Subject: FW: Heater repairs (non-DM, but no Pfusch)

It's getting cold in Maryland, so I decided to winterize my '79 camper (read
getting the heating system to work).
I think of adding a JC Whitney heat defrost assist kit
(http://www.jcwhitneyusa_dot_com/products/54zx1489.htm).
What is the list's common wisdom on these kits?
Does anyone know where I can get this or a similar unit in the UK.  I'm
currently restoring a 70 bus / camper, air flow from the main fan isn't all
that great. I'd like to improve it with an auxilary fan of some sort..

Thanks.....

Rgds,
