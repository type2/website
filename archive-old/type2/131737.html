Subject: Re: [T2] In Line Fuse for backup lights

&gt;From: &quot;Karl&quot; I should have mentioned where it is:

&gt;It lays along the body lip where the aux battery would sit. There is a 
&gt;black spring steel U holder for it.
&gt;Follow the black wire from the coil to the left and then along the lip to 
&gt;the left of the foam seal.


Could it tuck itself under the lip during engine removal/installation?
