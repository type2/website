Subject: Re:  Wagon wheels on a bus

All bus wheels from 71 up are 14'' and 5 x 112mm bolt 
pattern.

Sorry, of course I meant 5 lug.  And I know it is 5
x112 and the same as Mercedes and Merkur (with
seriously different offsets).  

What I don't know is the pattern on a 5 lug bug, or
what the proper offset is for a 71+ loaf bus.
