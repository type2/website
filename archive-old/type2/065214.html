Subject: The Beast learns a new trick.

 I went out and started up this morn and the engine back-fired.

 It seldom does this and I expect I need a tune up.

 In any case I get a pow! clank!

 What is this clank!

 I have gotten wiser with pain so tho I had already moved to re-start
I shut it off.

 There should be no clink.

 I get back there and all looks fine.

 There is this knock-out plug looking thing laying on the lip of the
rear clip.

 It looks like one of those gizmos for a cast electrical box.

 Cast - Concave surface on other side - - -  carburetor?

 I get down and look and directly in the back of the carby (fif)
is a hole a half inch in diameter. Right out of the venturi.

 Just like it was planned. This is a new Brazilian 30 PICT3.

 Little round cast indent with the Great Pyrimid of Alabama or some 
such. 

 So I stuck it back in, the wrong way of course, slapped a piece of 
duct tape over it and went to breakfast.

 Suck on this, Carby.

 When I got home I saw it had an up and a down, thin and thick section
so I slathered it with epoxy and popped it home.

 It runs fine so I guess good triumphs over evil once more. 

 I feel my karma is getting a little thin tho.
