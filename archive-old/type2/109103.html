Subject: RE: [T2] burned...

Ha hahahahahhahahahahahaha!
That's a brutal thing to contemplate, though no more tasteless than
them automatically assuming that you traffic'd illegal substances
_just_ because you are driving a bus.

Some folks just can't get their little minds passed that old tired
60's stereotype.

Ethically I think it would be wrong.  Just because they are in the
market doesn't mean that you should take their money.  It may be the
black market,.. but it's still a market.  Don't rip em off just
because they can't go to the cops and report you.  Even though I
don't particularly approve of their accosting total strangers for
such things.  Remember that they think you are a pretty relaxed
individual because you are driving a bus and therefore safe to ask
right?  (wrong, but hey maybe they were stoned when they asked you)

Odds are if they are asking total strangers it's just a matter of
time before they burn themselves by asking one of the local VW bus
driving police officers that I have met on their way home from work.
