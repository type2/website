Subject: Re: Locking engine latch

I'd be very interested in getting a rear hatch latch.  Is is possible to
get the tumbler keyed to the current locks on my bus?

Thanks,
mike



&gt; I got one of the locking engine compartment latches that Karl mentioned
&gt; the other day and it is *nice*!  It took me a couple minutes to figure out
&gt; what I was doing wrong in installation, so I took some pics and made up a
&gt; basic page. If you are considering this go to:

&gt; As always, I welcome corrections/comments.
