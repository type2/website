&gt;Gotta disagree with you on that one.  To get to the battery box on the

&gt;But, I believe we are talking about the box on the driver's (left) side.
&gt;In that case, of course, because of the steering wheel, the seat will
&gt;not swivel 180 degrees.  You do have to remove the seat (which is really
&gt;easy) and then swivel the platter 180 degrees to get to the box.

I have to hold my ground.  I installed a spare battery in Martha's 80
Vanagon in that spare compartment without ever removing the seat.  I simply
faced the seat backwards, and slid it forward.  I probably had to tilt the
seat back a little to avoid the steering wheel but I did not take the seat
out.  Try it, you may be suprised!
