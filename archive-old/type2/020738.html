&gt;  Before i condemn the starter, anybody have any ideas or suggestions?  and yes, i do have oil in it.  Doest this sound like a starter/electrical problem--like the starter does'nt have the power to turn overf, or something more serious?

Michael:
After reading my own words, I now think of something else (amazing how different it looks when it's not in the composition window!)
It could be hydraulic locking. Either oil or (more likely), fuel. Pull out the plugs, see if they are wet. If they are, disconnect the distributor wire to the coil (green one from the points.) Electronic? Make sure you have no spark, maybe
just ground out the H.T. wire from the coil. Then spin the engine over for a while to blow out the fuel.
PLEASE BE SURE YOU HAVE NO SPARK. My brother once burned up a Volvo
doing this, burned up the garage and the attached house somewhat, too! Coulda hired the most expensive shop in town for what he saved on that job!
