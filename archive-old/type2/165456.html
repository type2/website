&gt; George, or anyone else, if I have a broken perimeter
&gt; spring in the seat is there any particular advice about
&gt; welding it?  It is, of course, thin and it is spring
&gt; steel, so I am emboldened to ask.  I do not have a
&gt; spot welder, so it will be MIG or stick if at all.
&gt; (This is a flat metal strip around the outside of
&gt; the actual springs; hope this makes sense to anyone
&gt; who has replaced padding.)

Forget about welding.  It'll destroy the temper in the spring steel, so
it won't be spring steel.  Best bet is to steal one from another seat.
