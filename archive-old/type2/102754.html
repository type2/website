Subject: Re: +AFs-T2+AF0- 68 only?

+AD4- +AD4-        I just purchased a 1968 SC. It is in great shape and my wife and
I
+AD4- +AD4-love it . We have been split bus folks for quite some time and we are a
bit
+AD4- +AD4-short on BAY knowledge.

They also dont have a rear window defrost. The door locks are different. The
knobs on the dash are in a different order. The rear drums on both of my 68s
were different from each other and from a 69s I tried using. The only bays I
have ever owned have been 68s. Also from what Ive been told the trannies are
different. Just my .02 cents.
