        Having driven a new '69 bus to death, with many rebuilds,
including upto 1835cc,(with a fully counterweighted roller-bearing crank
and 3/4 race cam, super balanced, etc.) and now having had a '73 w/2.0L
for a few years, there's just one thing I'll say about this --- I
wouldn't even dream of putting a T1 in a bus, ever, whatever the cost.
       If getting a good T4 case proved all that difficult, I'd be
looking at sticking Subaru or some other watercooled engine in my westy.
Might anyway, just to get good heat and a longer lasting engine. I heard
somebody here saying that they stuck a 1500 in their bus and it was
&quot;fast enough for them&quot; --- I wonder what they'll say when it  wears out
&quot;fast enough for them&quot;.
