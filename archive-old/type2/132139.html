&gt; let's hope Greg took some pics! &lt;wink&gt;

ok,

i am trying to get my half-a-brain around the physics of how that is
working. i can't, but if it works, then it works. my backyard engineering
degree says the fuel pressure might be higher doing it this way, since the
return fuel will be fighting the supply at some point, and there could be
turbulence at the tee which would behave like a restriction in the line. if
you had a very healthy fuel pump this effect would be worse.

but it's like the test i did last night with the engine running on zero
measured fuel pressure. it's a &quot;go figure&quot; type of thing, until you do more
study, you can't explain it fully.
