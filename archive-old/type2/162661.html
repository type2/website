&gt; I was just wondering how well our busses sold compared to other brands in the day?  And why VW doesn't think it's profitable to make campmobile-type vehicles anymore.  Have costs gotten so high that they've priced themselves out of the market?  I don't think so.  Just look at RV prices these days.  When I was in that nice campground in Gulf Shores, I had to laugh that most of those vehicles cost over 100 times what I paid for mine.  And I slept just as good as they did.  Some of them were no doubt over $200K.  I dare say there are more of our vehicles still running around than similar vintage vans of any other brand.  But did they really compete when they were new?  I'd be interested in looking at the stats.  Surely somebody at VW should be able to service a market they pioneered and turn a profit.  JMHO....KR

having lived thru that era and bought buses including a 71 new from the
dealer.... some things to consider.

the original VW was sold to the market of the common man... basic
transportation.  they have abandoned that particular market niche
completely.
the splittys and bays did very well in the US market, but there was no
real competition (Corvans', and Econolines) but in the 70's a few things
changed,.   one the chicken wars caused the &quot;Truck&quot; versions to get a very
very high import tax, reason they stopped importing the pickup truck (even
built one in the USA on the golf chasis in PA)
and then the American Dollar started really tanking,  when I bought my
first new bus in 71 the dollar was worth 4 German marks, just before
Germany went to the Euro the dollar was only worth about 1.6 German Marks.
so even if the price to build a Van did not change, the cost in the USA
more than doubled because of the falling value of the dollar. it is even
worse today.  would that $2,100 1971 bus have been competitive if it had
cost $6,500!!!    I doubt I would have bought it...but that is what has
happened even if  there had been no change in the cost out the factory
door.  would that $35,000 Eurovan been more competitive if it had been
even $17,000???  doubt they could have made em fast enough... so a major
part of the problem was not even a VW issue.

could VW build a basic Bus today if they truely wanted to, sure, but it
would still have to meet the USA rules.  how many would buy a basic
stripped down underpowered Eurovan for $20,000???? doubt it would be many,
and VW probably has judge the market correctly, try buying a car nowdays,
just about any brand with manual cranked up and down windows??? it won't
be a VW I don't thing of any type, and what about with a basic AM or ever
AM/FM radio.. so lets see.

I want a basic bus, no A/C, no CD player, underpowered. lousy heat,
manually operated windows, door locks, seat adjustments etc... probably
the entire market is on this list and most of us wouldn't pay the $18-22k
it would cost!!!
