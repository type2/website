Subject: replacing my brake servo

&gt;The master cyliner has to be disconnected before removing the 
&gt;brake servo right? looks like it does...  Anyone know what that 
&gt;hose on the front part of the brake servo is for or what it goes to? 
&gt;it seems to dissapear into the side of the bus by the driver's side
door...

I'm curious:  Why are you replacing your servo?  No vacuum assist?  And
are you sure you are getting vacuum at the servo?

Also, if you haven't replaced your MC in a long time, its possible that
it has been leaking brake fluid into the servo so watch out when you
start to remove it.  You don't want to get a face full of fluid!!  And
if this turns out to be the case, you'll want to replace your MC anyway.
