Subject: electrical gremlins . . .chapt 3 and 4

So the tail light problem was a corroded ground wire, and the headlight was
(hesitation for the stupid feeling) a fuse (I didn't know that each high
and low beam had its own fuse. Learn something everyday) Now on to chapter
3:

The car starts hard when its warm. Cold it starts in less then a three
seconds. Warm it cranks slowly and barely rolls over. Now there are no
doubt other problems (I'm doing a full tune up tomorrow and replacing the
air filters). However there is a really nasty splice (melted wire and
electrical tape) on a very thick red wire that goes from the battery
through the firewall (I assume to the starter) I can only hypothesize that
replacing the (assumed) starter wire will only make my car safer and start
better. so my question is: what is the spec on this wire for a 75 bus? what
gauge and how long should it be? should I just go to the local VWFLAPS and
get a new wire, or should I go to the hardware store and buy the wire and
fittings (to the starter and battery).

Chapter 4: No reverse lights? Replace the backup switch on the tranny?

I hate hate hate electrical problems. Good thing that the bus runs and
drives so well.

Thanks to all the people who have written and helped me out. The fuse idea
came from a p-mail from the list.

Oh yeah, I went to sears and got a nice timing gun for 50 big ones (its all
shiny and 20 bucks less then the crappy one at shucks), and a T/D meter for
19.99 (ten dollars more then my first one) had enough left over for a new
tool box that had lots of little drawers for the odd screws and sheet metal
bolts, and a 13mm open/box end wrench. . . cause you cant do a tune up w/o
one.
