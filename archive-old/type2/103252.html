Subject: Re: [T2] Horsepower

&gt;Since we're on the subject of using a T1 engine in a bus, what do you think
&gt;about the carrier problem? I guess we've all seen the little carrier 
&gt;bracket
&gt;adapter that goes over the oil pump cover, where you don't have a universal
&gt;case. This just seems like it is not a good thing to me.. the kind of thing
&gt;to make a good VW engineer cry. Since I've seen even the carrier brackets
&gt;split and fail, I hate to think about what that kind of torque could do,
&gt;focused on such a small and centered area, where the casting is really not
&gt;very thick.
&gt;I have seen tranny brackets (after market) used to support the tranny in
&gt;sand rails, etc.. Why would something like this not be helpful in helping 
&gt;to
&gt;support the transmission and to relieve stresses on the engine and carrier
&gt;systems?

Hmm. in the later type 2's the tranny is supported (well sort of compared
to an early bus that support is minimal. On my drag bug I have a tranny
support bracket and an engine support bracket.

But more importantly,  a rear engine support bracket is used that is not
connected to the oil pump. The oil pump support is just silly, and is not
recommended. If you have a type 1 case, make sure it can use a real
support bracket. Often you can tap and die one to make it so.
