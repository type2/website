Subject: VW Trends Cruise Oct 19th - Calling All Bays!

Greetings So. Cal. listees -

If you weren't aware of it, now you are. VW Trends is having their Charity 
Cruise this Saturday - see the www.vwtrendsweb_dot_com website for specifics.

Folks... I noticed a spectacular LACK of Bays last run. Let's make this 
event!! We'll have free (as usual) &quot;Save The Bays!&quot; window stickers for all 
Bays in attendance.

I'm sure some of the Turbo Bugs that took back seat to Itch at Irwindale 
will be there too. I need backup! These hot rodders are a tough bunch, and 
maybe we should show them a Tour de Force of what's in stock for the next 
Drag Day event.

See you there -

Mike &amp; Itch / Jim &amp; Pootie
&quot;Save The Bays!&quot;
