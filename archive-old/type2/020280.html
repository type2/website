Espar is the modern company of eberspacher www.espar_dot_com they know nothing of old
eberspachers though so don't ask, they just get aggravated.  New heaters from them are
much more efficient and reliable but the price tag, as quoted to me through a tractor
trailer supply house (about the only source for them as well as marine suppliers) was
$1200 for a diesel one!! and $1500 for a gasoline unit!!! (this research was done a
little over a year ago so i don't remember who gave me those quotes. ) Ouch thats
expensive . I scraped the idea and went with restoring the stock heat system to tip top
shape, of course i live in the salt belt so my bus is stored for the winter anyway

jamie

&gt; I have two questions about heat. First, where can you get a B1C and how much
&gt; do they cost?
