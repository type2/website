Subject: How to wire stove for 1978 Westy ?

--Boundary_(ID_OW4oTpGUeBfrJY6gI6KdeA)
Content-type: text/plain; charset=iso-8859-1
Content-transfer-encoding: 7BIT

I have a 1978 Westy deluxe that was missing the sink / stove cabinet
when I purchased it. I found a new cabinet in good shape and want to
install it. I see a long red wire with a push on connector, and a short brown
wire with push on connector (I take it to be ground ?). 

Just to make it more confusing, the long red wire is connected
in the middle to a 4-way small square black connector.
in the bottom is one red wire, other red long wire with push
on connector out the bottom. Out the top are two 6&quot; black
wires that today are not connected to anything ??

Can someone advise me on how to wire this up ? Is there
some documentation on the site I have missed ?

Thanks!
Dean
