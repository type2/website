Subject: Brake Concerns (long)

I've been left a bit confused by my brakes (73 Westy) of late. 
Questions are at the end of this post if you don't want to read the
background info.  

About a week ago I was driving into Houston on the freeway and had to
come to an abrupt halt. (This is perhaps relevant later.) After I got
off the freeway and neared the destination, I happened to glance down at
the dash and noticed my the Brake Light came on when I pressed the
brakes.  I don't know exactly when this started.

My heart skipped a beat as I looked for the nearest (and most forgiving)
thing to steer the bus into.  But I soon found that I had no need of
such an emergency brake; the bus stopped just fine, as it always had.  I
cautiously kept driving the remaining few blocks to my friend's house
and got there fine,  although when I pressed the brake, the light still
came on.

Once I got there I checked the brake fluid level in the resevoir, and it
hadn't changed.  I thought it might be a short in the system, and had my
friend watch my tail lights while I pressed the brake.  They came on,
but so did the dash light.

Since there was no fluid loss, I figured that the problem was with the
Master Cylinder, which really bummed me out since I had just put in a
new one about a month ago.  Knowing that one cylinder will do the job of
two in a pinch, I took my chances and carefully drove home.

Okay, so the bus has sat idle all week and today there was a break in
the weather so I went out to do some exploratory surgery.  A surface
inspection revealed no leaks, as I expected.  Disconnecting the sensor
for the rear cylinder caused the dash light to go out after a few
pressings of the brake.  Not sure why.

Fearing a leaky wheel cylinder, and having read in Muir that poorly
adjusted brakes can cause the light to go on (true?), I decided to
remove the drums and look closer at my rear brakes (for the first time ever).

While there were no leaks, they were worn and I need to put in new pads.
 I adjusted them as best as I could and decided to test my work by
driving it around the parking lot.

As before, the brakes worked fine, and the light came on when I pressed
the brakes.  I tested them for a while, at one point coming to a quick
stop from about 35 mph.  As I was pulling the van back into the carport,
I noticed the brake light wasn't on anymore!  Did my adjustment fix it? 
I thought that the bulb may have gone out, or perhaps that a sensor went
bad, so I checked them by opening up the bleeder valves on both the rear
and front systems, and the brake light came on like it's supposed to.

SO.... the questions....

Could adjusting my breaks really have fixed the brake light problem?  If
so, then please explain.  I thought that the light came on when there
was a loss of pressure.  How can poorly adjusted brakes cause this?

I'm wondering if it might have something to do with the pressure
regulator.  Perhaps when I initially had to make the quick stop, this
caused the mechanism in the regulator to somehow lock up.  Perhaps my
quick stops today during the testing &quot;unstuck&quot; the mechanism, fixing the
brake light problem.  Is this this possible?

Since the brake light is no longer coming on, and the sensors work,
should I be concerned about the Master Cylinder?

Thanks in advance for any thoughts on these matters.
