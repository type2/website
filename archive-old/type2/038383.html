Subject: Everybus

Thanks to alot of help from Chris Cybulski and John Stainkamp, I was
able to get the Adventurewagen out to Everybus.  Despite the rain and
having to go to work for a few hours on Saturday, I thoroughly enjoyed
participating in my first bus event as an owner!
Sorry about the Toyota in the caravan to Farmington, still had a few
items on the bus's punch list before I take it very far from home.

It was great to meet everybody, I'm still working on sorting out names
and buses, but I'll get there.  Got to meet  up with fellow
Adventurewagen owner Nikki Elko and compare notes, witnessed my first
case burning (thanks Dave), enjoyed some great food - many thanks to the
Roanoke Valley Bus Club, and to demonstrate my tarp stringing abilities
(Judy, next time I promise to have an actual plan).

Sunday brought sunshine and a nice time at Farmington, found a few odd
parts and got a ride in the Pinzgauer!  Hopefully everyone made it home
safely and without to much misadventure.
