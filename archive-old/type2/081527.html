Subject: [T2] brake help needed!


&gt; Hello,
&gt;
&gt; Ok, I am finally getting around to doing my brakes and wouldnt you =
know
it,
&gt; I cannot for the life of me
&gt; get any of the dang lugnuts to start loosening up. When I had this =
random
&gt; shop give me an estimate a month back, they must have just gone nuts =
with
&gt; the airpowered gun and they are essentially welded in place it seems.

I've been there.
I bought a good half inch socket driver(flex end, not a ratchet) 3 feet
long.
On this I put a 19mm impact socket.
When they are so tight jumping on the thing wont crack them loose I hit =
the
socket really hard with a 2 pound hammer. This works almost all the time =
but
when it doesn't I get a propane torch and get them glowing if I can. If =
that
doesnt work I use a bigger hammer:-)
I've broken the cross shaped tire irons so I would say a good long =
socket
bar is the best bet.
Good luck.
Wear thick gloves:-)
Brian


&gt; Should I run buy one of those cross shaped lugwrenches, so I get more
&gt; leverage and hopefully then will be able to bust them loose, or do I =
need
to
&gt; wait till tuesday to find a shop someplace with an airgun where they =
can
&gt; break them free for me?
&gt;
&gt; Jeez, if I had a flat tire I would be screwed. Or maybe the shop was =
made
&gt; that I said I think I would rather just not have them do the work
afterall.
&gt;
&gt; any thoughts on this are appreciatted.
&gt;
&gt; Christopher
