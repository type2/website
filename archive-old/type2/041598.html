Subject: Re: Front Axle Beam Replacement
Content-Disposition: inline

It's not that hard. I did it twice by myself - no need for extra hands. No special tools needed - with the exception of a hydraulic trolley jack and a big (30 mm?) socket for the balljoints.
Plan a day when you do it the first time, the second time around it's still a fun filled afternoon.

I have a very solid beam off a '79 bus for sale in Maryland. $150

Subject: Front Axle Beam Replacement

With two posts today on the subject, I want to remind everyone of the
article I did some years ago on how to do this.  It is in the type2
library..  got to the library, then suspension, then front axle beam.  the
beam can still be had for ~$600 new at last check, and good used ones seem
to be $100-150.  Last time I did this (3 years ago), I checked and a
mechanic wanted $300 for the beam and $300 labor, total $600.  I regard
that as pretty fair even if you split it as $150 for the beam and $450 for
labor... it is a labor intensive job, like so many other VW tasks.  If you
want to do it at home, there is nothing too difficult, it is just very big
and very heavy... have 3 people on hand!!!
