 have a '64 crew cab and the first line of Id plate reads:

The VIN is 265050543. Does this mean my car was made on 10.29.64?
- - - - 
the  265 in the vin means  a 65 truck

the first line suggests an oct 29th production date

are you sure the vehicle is registered correctly?   does it have pull out or
push button cab door handles?
