&gt; Well I admit.  Those times I've been driving in Texas I've been mostly on my way

&gt; Colorado and Broke a fan belt.  Couldn't find the spare so hitched into
&gt; Amarillo...got a ride in a gas guzzling pontiac with a bad carb...wouldn't go
&gt; over 20 mph on the hills and cruised at 30 on the flats.  Texas seems big at 30
&gt; mph...Got back with the new belt and THEN found the spare......Once drove  over
&gt; a hundred miles out in west Texas around Van Horn  at 15 MPH with a retread that
&gt; lost all but one chunk of tread...bump bump bump  Texas seems REALLY big at 15
&gt; MPH..
&gt;
&gt; But like I say I'll admit Texas must have a lot of great stuff.  I guess I've
&gt; always had my vision focussed elsewhere.    John Jensen in Annapolis...

Not to mention that the most spectacular parts of Texas are hidden; it's
lots easier to build super highways out where it's flat and there're few
obstacles.  Get a little ways away from the interstates and down into
the canyons and river breaks and you'll find some real beauty,
especially in the morning or late afternoon.
