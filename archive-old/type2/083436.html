Subject: I just saved $300 on my alignment - Toronto owners stay away from Don Valley Volkswagen

I just bought six (yes two spares) brand new 215/65-15 
Michelin Agilis 51's. To protect my investment I thought an 
aligment job would be a good idea, particulalrly because of 
the excessive wear on the inside tread of of one of my old 
tires.

Since I figured a Vanagon is a funny beast I thought just 
this once I would go to the dealer (Don Valley Volkswagen at 
Eglinton and the DVP). They would not quote me a price for 
alignment... here is the jist of the conversation:

DVV: We can't quote you a price but it will be between two 
and four hours at $90 an hour (ie: $180 to $360)

Me: Well how long does the shop manual say the job should be

DVV: One hour

Me: Then charge me an hour

DVV: But it probably will take longer

Me: If something like an alignment, or whatever takes 45 
minutes and the shop manual says an hour and a half how much 
d you charge?

DVV: 1 1/2 hours

Me: So you do charge by the shop manual

DVV: That's our policy

Me: But not in this case

DVV: Not in this case

Me: Thank you goodbye

Now I wouldn't go there for everything but I decided to try 
Canadian Tire near my house (Church and Bloor). I was out the 
door for the standard $80. Great guys there too... Baksh 
(Pronounced &quot;Bosch&quot;) did my tires and alignment and is an all 
around nice guy. His collegue Bill even tightened a clamp up 
on my exhaust... no charge. 

Thanks,
Chris
