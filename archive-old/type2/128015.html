Subject: For Sale - 1978 Westy

Well, I've put a bit of thought into it and I've decided I'm going
to sell my 1978 Westy.  It doesn't get the use out of it that it
deserves and come winter time I'd really like/need to have something
4wd that also has some utility to it.  Some of you may remember
me posting info/questions about it when I first got it, but here's
the info again...

1978 VW Campmobile Deluxe
2.0L fuel-injected Type4.
Bugpack exhaust, no more cat or EGR.
Swaybars front and rear
14&quot; BBS rims, proper size/spacing.
Sony tape player
Racimex dual oil coolers (not in use)
Fridge works
Stove works
Sink/faucet works, haven't had the pump working yet

New items include:

Both rear taillight lenses
Radio antenna
City water hookup
Aux battery for fridge &amp; water pump
Turn signal stalk
Turn signal relay
Fuel evap hoses

Tires are nearly brand new as well.

Problem areas:

There are a couple of dime-size areas where rust is starting to bubble.
The front by the emblem has a dent that can easily be pushed out.
The rear corners by the tail lamps have the usual dings.
The screen in the top canvas need to be replaced but the canvas itself is
fine and has no holes.
The driver's side louvered windows are missing the bottom louver.
The laminate on the cabinets has started to come up and has broken off
in places, but the drawers and doors still work fine.  One drawer needs
a new latch.
The stove/sink cover hinges need to be reattached to the countertop.
Needs a new glovebox liner.
Seats need to be re-covered, I just put seat covers on them.

I'm not sure what a fair asking price is for a Westy in this condition, it
runs like a champ, doesn't leak or burn any fluids, and the paint still
has a decent gloss to it.  With some wax it'd really shine.  I was thinking
of asking around $3500 for it or trading for a 4wd of similar value.

Westy is located in northern Arizona.  You can see pics here...

I also recently went through and shampooed the seats and carpet, which
isn't reflected in the pics.  If anyone has any questions please feel free
to ask.  Thanks!
