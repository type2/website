Subject: Re: [T2] Brown wire to generator?

&gt; '71 Bus
&gt; Installed rebuilt Bosch 30A generator
&gt; The new generator has just two connectors, on top at the rear, near the
&gt; pulley.  I reconnected the red and green wires there, as they were
&gt; connected to the old generator.
&gt;
&gt; The old generator had a third connection (also on top but towards the
&gt; front, closer to the fan housing).  The brown wire was connected to this
&gt; third terminal on the old generator, but there's no such third terminal
&gt; on the new one.
&gt;
&gt; Anyone know what this third wire is, and where should it go in the
&gt; absence of a third terminal on the generator?  The Bus runs fine without
&gt; it connected (and the generator light turns off after starting), but it
&gt; must have some purpose... right?

the third wire is a ground. it connects the chassis of the regulator to
the chassis of the generator. you can put it under the gen strap or use a
big terminal and put it on the strap bolt/nut.
It is sort of a &quot;just in case&quot; ground. the ground path from the gen to the
reg is convoluted and the regulator mounting doesnt always ground to the
chassis that well.
I would connect it back.
