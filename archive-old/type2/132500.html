Subject: Re: [T2] was No Juice&gt;&gt;now clicking CV

Hi Frank,

Time to take the Axle off and get a look at the CV joints. If your 
balls aren't scorched and discolored, you will be able to reassemble 
with fresh grease and the problem is solved.

The automatic axles are not interchangeable with standard-tranny axles. 
The CV joints themselves ARE.

An Auto-tranny bus can't even interchange its own axles, as the right 
and left are different lengths.

Happy trails,

Greg Potts

&gt; Next problem, I have a serious clicking form the rear.  I have heard

&gt; is the CV probably.  I am unclear how to isolate.
&gt; Would this be repairable or just replaceable.
