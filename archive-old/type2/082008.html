Subject: Re: [T2] more on VW ads

I saw this commercial, also... was hoping that it would turn out to be a
ghia promo when they said they turned to an Italian car designer. I wish
Speedvision would dig around for some early bus commercials :)

&gt; the ad concentrated on a new feature of the beetle - a larger rear window.
&gt; IIRC, the ad went something to the tune of, &quot;the VW beetle is so close
&gt; to perfect that this is the only change needed.&quot;
&gt;
&gt; then it showed comparison pics of a split-window beetle vs. the new,
larger
&gt; rear window.  i think they said this was for '58 model year, but i really
can't
&gt; remember
