Subject: Re: [T2] Fuel Vents?

I was really hoping that somebody with a really great
method would write as it is really a PITA for someone
with fat - ahem - muscular arms...

It's been years since I've done it, but lessee if I
can remember. Pop that big round cover off the right
side of the engine compartment and remove the FI ECU.
Remove the screws holding the filler neck on the
outside of the body. Here's where my memory fades cuz
I don't want to remember - I THINK you can access a
hose clamp where the steel pipe you see through the
big round hole attaches to the short hose that
attaches to the gas tank. Loosen that clamp and work
the pipe out of the hose. I don't remember if you can
pull the steel pipe out through the big round hole or
not... So I'm not being a whole bunch of help! I know
that at one time I worked the new elbow on with the
steel pipe in place and was able to tighten the clamp
at the elbow. I also know that I removed the steel
pipe, stuck the new elbow on, and reattached the pipe,
but I just don't recall the procedure. Hopefully
someone with brains and a working memory will add
their two bits' worth! -BaH

&gt; How does one go replacing the filler neck hose?  I
&gt; suspect that I
&gt; might have the same issue.

&gt; Thanks in advance,
