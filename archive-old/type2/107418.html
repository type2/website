Subject: AVP Update

Hi Gang,

Summer is officially over in San Diego...it's cool enough for Pumpkin II to
climb out of mission valley in 4th gear!
I'm now up to 4,000 miles on the AVP rebuild, including a road trip up the
CA coast and through the somewhat scorching San Jaquin Valley in July. Still
going strong :0)

-Several oil changes during break-in (Quaker 20W-50). No particles after the
second change.

-Valves are holding pretty good, though #3 exhaust seems to tighten up .001
every 1500 miles.

-No real leaks to speak of.


The only real troubles I had were things coming loose and falling off:

- A CV fell off due to missing backing plates and lock-washers (not MY
fault). Fortunately I was in the Jack-in-the-Box drive through, so no damage
was done. I'll be checking the torque on those for a while...

- A couple of the big tranny-engine nuts worked loose, but I caught them
before anything happened. Again, I crawl around and check everything I can
reach on a regular basis.
