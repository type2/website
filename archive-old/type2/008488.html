Subject: R+R T4 engine mounts in the car?

Before I pull the engine to turn the flywheel to cure the shudders ('78,
2.0FI, 4spd) I have noticed the motor mounts are shot.  Are these
serviceable without removing the engine or so much of the fan housing that
it would make sense to remove the engine?  I have a young vw fan who is hot
for his first van, and I want him to get a mechanically perfect as can be
piece.  Thanks in advance, Patrick
