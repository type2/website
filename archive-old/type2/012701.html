Michael:

Man, are you opening a can o' worms!  As far as I can assess, there are as many opinions on oil for VW's as there are people driving them.  Here's what I have arrived at, however.  One list member a few months ago suggested using heavy duty oil designed for diesel engines.  This makes sense, since the operating characteristics of air-cooled motors more closely mimics diesel engines.  Also, many VW folks say to only use single weight oil, such as 30wt.  Hence, I use Pennzoil HD 30wt in my 71 bus.  Let's be real, though.  Pretty much any good quality oil will work if you change it every 3k miles, like we all should.
