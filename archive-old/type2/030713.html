Subject: Curtains, finally!
Message-ID: &lt;Pine.GSO.3.96.990222144155.14925D-100000_at_larry_dot_cas.utk_dot_edu&gt;


Wanted to share a few of the finer points of curtain making:

-Sewing machines are pretty cool.  Especially 60 yr-old Singers.

-9 yards of fabric, 48&quot; bolt is plenty of material to do double-thick
curtains for all side windows and back, including the inside of the
antilanechange closet,  but lacks enough to do the front surround.

-it does have enough to make some cool coordinating pillows and napkins,
along with stylish tie backs for the curtains, though.

-Your wife will call your mother and tell her that her son has taken up
sewing.  Raucous laughter will ensue at your expense.

-Your wife will discover that the curtains look pretty nice, and will
start to get really fired up about accessorizing and the &quot;look&quot; that you
will have at the next campout! (ulterior motive)


This is a do-able weekend project, and involved very little going-outside.
As I had an illness and it was quite cold, this worked out beautifully.  I
highly recommend this project to anyone with a sewing machine and some
time.  

Now it's off to go look for some more cheap fabric to recover the seats!
:)

HINT:  Shop the remnant tables and stores!  My fabric cost $.80 per yard!
