Subject: Re: [T2] Re: What is the toughest climb you ever drove?

&gt; The Coquihalla Hwy is tough and I know one person's van that died there,
&gt; but for me the worst was the highway in Guatemala on the way up to Lake
&gt; Atitlan.  The roads seem to get higher and higher for days.  (We often had
&gt; to just plain stop because we couldn't make it any higher, but in the
&gt; morning we always made it over the peaks - thank Jah).

Shawn I think you meant - thank Ekahau
