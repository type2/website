Subject: after market fuel pump wiring
Date: Wed, 25 Nov 1998 17:00:09 -0500

Hi List,
I'm adding an electric fuel pump to my '72 westy and I'm wondering how you
wire this up so that it is only running when the engine is on, and not just
all the time the key is on.  The package suggests grounding it through the
oil pressure switch, but I'd rather hear what setups have worked
successfully in old VW's.  Any insight would be greatly appreciated. TIA
Mark
