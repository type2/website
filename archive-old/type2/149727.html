&gt; HOWEVER - I don't know whether or
&gt; not I need to put shims under the cylinders to
&gt; compensate, or if the &quot;lip&quot; that is machined into the
&gt; new head already compensates for the height
&gt; difference? Has anyone else used AMC heads with this
&gt; lip, and if so, did you use shims under the cylinders
&gt; or not?

Because the size of the step is slightly bigger than size of the  
gasket if you will lower the compression ratio anyway but I think  
this is intended. Using both the step and gasket will mean not enough  
squish in the combustion chamber.

&gt; If I do need to remove the cylinders after all, will
&gt; it be possible to put them back on without using a
&gt; ring compressor? (I have one, but I'm sure it's too
&gt; long to fit between the piston and the crankcase with
&gt; the pistons in situ)

You can probably stick something through the piston pin bore to keep  
the piston from move when you rest the cylinder but in a jam a large  
hose clamp should work to compress the rings.
