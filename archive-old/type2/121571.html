If you have the original VR put it back on and take the alternator to any 
Bosch authorized parts dealer. There might be a hundred in Portland. See 
your local yellow pages. Ask them to test it. If it tests good, like I told 
you before, resolve all wiring issues first. Then hook it up. If it tests 
bad, did you send in the warranty and do you have the receipt?? NO??? Pay 
your dues, trade it in for a new one. Yes?? Congratulations, you can trade 
for replacement at no cost.

Now go back to the Bentley, first page of the electrical section, first or 
second paragraph. Believe what it says about verifying the wiring BEFORE 
further diagnostics, so you won't burn out another. Skip steps=waste 
time/money.

&gt;Now, I've pulled the alternator (a rebuilt Bosch), with a plan to have
&gt;it tested. If there's a listee out there in the greater Portland Area
&gt;that has a shop they trust for these types of tests, please share.
&gt;Right about now someone will mention that I should have performed all
&gt;of these tests before ever installing the new VR in the first place.

Wonderful to see the facts forming in your mind.

&gt;Well, life is a learning opportunty.

With that attitude you can't miss. Go back to the first step you skipped 
and start over and don't skip any more. Never remove an alternator until 
you prove it's required. Bentley gives the procedure for testing it in 
situ. Any Bosch dealer can provide you with a one sheet genuine Bosch 
diagnostic procedure. Charging system testing is on one side and 
battery/starter testing is on the other.
