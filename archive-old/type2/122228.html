Subject: Re: [T2] Body Repair Panel Source Tips

I'd have to say, that given the fact it's taken 20 to 30 years to reach the 
&quot;needs to be replaced&quot; condition, that's pretty dammned great.  Expose the 
thinner steel in today's cars(and replacement panels), paint it with the 
materials VW used on our buses, and I bet it doesn't take a fraction of that 
time to oxidize into swiss cheese.  The issue wasn't the metal, it is the 
salty environment.  I have a '70 without ANY body rot, and it is because it 
wasn't near the ocean or the salted roads where it snows.

&gt;Hey, that original Germanic steel rots out pretty damned fast in the
&gt;presence of salt! I've seen too many of these things rot out. Tom
