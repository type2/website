I have spent the best part of today updating the story about this very
thorough restoration job of a splitty. Although it is not a loaf it is very
worthwhile as the basic construction of a bay is not all that different. The
latest additions are about building up the chassis and the cargo floor
supports.
Go treat yourself and dream about how it would be if you could you a job
like this.

column under Technical).
