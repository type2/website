Subject: Re: [T2] hitch receiver cargo shelf-any experience?

&gt;2. Anything you carry on the platform will get _dirty_!  
&gt;

ESPECIALLY if your VW has an oil leak...

Towed my Hyundai Excel from VA to TN with my 2.0L Beetle. Lost the 
thermostat pulley bolt which goes all the way into the oil pan, couldn't 
solve the leak on the road, sprayed a whole case of oil on the Excel 
during the trip! Took FOREVER to get all that oil washed off! &lt;grin!&gt; 
Sold the Excel a few months later. Bet it never rusted!

Alternative: buy a 40x48 inch trailer from Harbor Freight for $180, 
build a water tight plywood box on top (aka Westy trailer) and have fun. 
Future plan for us as our family grows and we don't want to drive larger 
vehicles for those few weekends (4?) a year when we have more stuff than 
trunk. Also a good way to haul bicycles (on top of trailer box with 
rooftop style carriers). Seal with boat varnish for upscale look.
