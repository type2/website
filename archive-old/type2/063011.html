Subject: Starter Problem cure - Bosch WR1 kit

Yo, all!

Since we seem to be about to start another round of no-start stories, let
me do my best to cut to the chase.  Yes, St. Muir's ford solenoid trick
works.  GM, Chrysler, and (probably) Fiat have made similar starter relays
at one time or another. In addition and finally, Mr. Robert Bosch awoke
one fine morning and found that the tooth fairy had left something closely
resembling a clue under his pillow.  Marching his rear down to the shop,
he must have handed it off to his engineers with the question, &quot;Why can't
we make something like this that is elegant, requires no cutting of wires
and minimal drilling into the body of those old busses?&quot;

The end result of this process is something called the &quot;Bosch WR-1 kit&quot;.
It comes with a relay, all the correct conectors, a detailed instruction
sheet, and is fused _at_ 15 amps.  You need only drill one hole in your
precious bus for a sheet metal screw to suspend the sucker and ground it.
This solution was proposed first by some (unknown, but applauded) other
list member back a bit.  As my bus has been a notorious non-starter, I
went down and tried to find it.  The perversity of nature dictates that
such an incredibly useful item be impossible to find, and indeed this is
true.  The WR-1 kit is only ever mentioned in a footnote in the starter
section of the Bosch master catalog :-( Getting your standard issue
parts-dweeb to actually find the entry, not to mention acquire one is nigh
on to impossible.  Fortunately, y'all may take advantage of the multiple
phone calls I made to innumerable FLAPS and to Robert Bosch, USA and find
the damned thing almost immediately by calling the following Company:

Olympic Auto Parts
5168 Eisenhower Avenue
Alexandria, VA  22304
Tel. - (703) 370-0850

Once you have reached this august assemblage of parts salesmen, ask
specifically for David Parker, as the rest of the counter-persons are
clueless as a clam on this particular item.  He will sell you one of these
kits for the princely sum of ~$11.00 US plus shipping.  As of last week,
they still had 2 in stock, though Monseur Parker promised to support all
the business I could send his way.  Standard disclaimers apply.  I ain't
even that thrilled with these folk generally, as I have had any number of
orders misfilled, but I do trust this one guy a bit and all they have to
handle is two letters, a number and a hyphen.  Try your local people
first, but if that doesn't work I offer this as an alternative.
