&quot;Any pointers on the curtain for the passenger side, rear quarter?  How
difficult is it to pull out the closet, etc. back there to get into the
window?&quot;

    Hi. I replaced this curtain without removing the closet. This was on a
73 so should be the same for your 71.
Open the rear shelf door and you'll see 2 stainless screws holding the
curtain panel to the body. Remove these.
At the front of the closet open the tall door and you'll find two more
screws to remove. Now above the closet
(in the cubby that holds the front hamock when it's rolled up) you should
see one more screw. Remove this and the entire press board with attached
curtain can be slid out the tall front closet door. It may take some
carefull bending but it'll come out.
   You'll find the original curtains were stapled to the hardboard in a way
to simulate creases in the curtain.
Use the old as a pattern to make your new curtain and install in reverse:)
