Two weeks ago as we drove up I-5 from Tacoma en route to Seattle, we ran for a 
few minutes alongside a &quot;Country Camper&quot; conversion on an air-cooled Vanagon 
with California plates.

This conversion had a fairly tall/deep poptop that ended with a spoiler at the 
back.  The poptop started about 2' behind the front of the van's top. The 
front of the poptop sloped back sharply, and there was no luggage carrier.

This was a &quot;first sighting&quot; for me.

I've been trying to do research to figure out my 1975 camper bus.  I received 
a complete history of previous owners, etc., it was originally sent from 
Germany to California in 1975, &amp; was converted to a camper by &quot;Country Home 
Camper Co.&quot; in Oakland, CA.
