&gt;While we're on the subject of MOFOCO, I bought a rebuilt PICT 34 from 
them 
&gt;that absolutely refuses to idle on my 73 bug. The carb I took off 
&gt;(subsequently rebuilt by yours truly) runs OK, with the typical dead 
spot 
&gt;induced by a 009..but that's another thread. Anyone out there have any 
idea
&gt; 
&gt;why a supposedly rebuilt card wouldn't idle on a Bug? BTW, I did send it 

&gt;back once. They claim to have checked it out on an engine and said it 
was 
&gt;OK.
