Subject: Re: [T2] Gasoline coming out of tailpipe

Mark,
 
The carburetor I put on is Brazilian (Boscar? or something like  that) and is 
a PICT 30/31.  As far as I can tell it &quot;looks&quot; new.   The previous carburetor 
was a Solex PICT 34-3.  Even with the old  carburetor I had to always keep my 
foot on the accelerator to keep it running  but only after I rebuilt it did I 
have gas coming out the tail pipe.  One  thing I did notice that didn't occur 
to me before was that when I was doing a  compression check, the plug on the 
#2 cylinder had gas on it when I took it  out.  Is it possible that the intake 
valve is stuck open in this  cylinder? If this is possible about the only way 
I can think this MIGHT  occur is if the valve spring is busted or 
something--yea I know I'm reaching but  I will track that down as well.
 
Phil
