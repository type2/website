I just received a mailing from VWoA Spring 2000 Service
Publications Index and they list original manuals from 1972 forward but
maybe a call will dig up one that they did not have enough of to list in
the
index.


I called and they have no 72 Bus owners manuals, just a few other types.

If someone has a nice 72 owners manual and a camper book from the time
we would love to buy it from you!

Thanks
Meredith
