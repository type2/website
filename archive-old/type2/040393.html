Subject: tranny seals question

hey volks,
a online buddy of mine emailed me this question about
his bus.   along with refering to the list of course,
it would be cool to give him an answer(with you all
getting the credit of course.   so can anyone help?
TIA
Shelby

I've got a question for you that I hope you may be
able to answer:
My bus is a '74.  I have to pull the motor to do 2
things 1)replace the
dipstick tube that has broken off flush at the bottom
and 2) I have to do
the seals in the tranny, leaking pretty bad.  My
question is this:  how many
seals are in the tranny, am I looking 3 on the body of
the tranny and one
for each transaxle? for a grand total of 5?  I've been
on to the type2 parts
website and have located a &quot;Gasket Kit&quot; for a manual
transmission between
the years of 72 &amp; 75.  Gasket kit is what I'm lookin'
for right?  Gaskets -
Seals, same thing right man?  The reason I am tenative
about it is because
when I called them the guy wasn't familiar with
tranny's and couldn't tell
me exactly how many &quot;gaskets&quot; come with the kit.  Both
my front and rear
seals are leaking - combine that with a sloppy
dipstick tube and you've got
a messy motor!If you've got some knowledge of the
tranny seals that would be 
great....
Thanks
