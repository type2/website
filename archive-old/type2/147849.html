Subject: Another Colorado Westy...

List,

Guess I'm adding to the Colorado &quot;selling the bus&quot; faction and have listed 
my '78
on thesamba_dot_com also.By list and word of mouth I've gone through 4 buyers
since late January and really want someone motivated to take on the project
and get some excellent parts. I'm asking $1500 for the basic project:

' 78 Dakota Beige Deluxe California Westy. Factory AC plus a second unit.
132k very little rust, has all options including side step, gold ring 
clock, front table,
correct height center console, fridge with ice trays, front tire mount, 
trailer hitch, etc.
Have enough upholstery to complete interior (brown-green plaid) and extra 
set of
15&quot; Fuchs alloys. Dual battery set up and locking engine compartment. Factory
literature, manual and birth certificate. #3 seat has dropped so not drivable.

Cash buyer will get first call and discount(s) on OEM and HTF parts including:
Weddle built 091 trans with Lock-Right (O miles), Ambulance fans (Dakota 
Beige),
Sanden AC conversion and manuals, fresh built BA6 gas heater with 2 new plugs
plus spare parts with full belly pan. Also have a spare 2-liter motor and 
extra set of
'74 (big valve) heads, 7 new sodium valves, new blueprinted injectors, 
second interior,
newish heat muffs,glass, bumpers with center strips/ends, etc. etc.

Please p-mail for inquiries. I've sworn I wouldn't part this project out 
but might if its
still here in a month or so. Sorry for all the band-width but this will 
probably be my
next-to-last email. I didn't want to say goodbye without sharing a copy of 
the very
touching letter the original owner wrote his son when he gave him the Westy 
a few years ago. . .

Adios for now,
Craig in CO
