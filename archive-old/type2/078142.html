Subject: Re: [T2] Tires for Westy

Don, the best tires for the bay (even the manual states this) are &quot;D&quot; rated
tires.  For one reason the load limit is pretty high (a loaded westy will
weigh around 5000 lbs.) but also the D rated tires have a stiffer side wall
for more stability in cross winds.  Believe me, here in Kansas before I
could put new tires on the last bus I purchased, I almost got sick driving
60 miles to KC in a cross wind!!  You will love the way the stiffer tires
handle.  Have you ever been driving on a windy day and had your bus do the
&quot;semi shimmy&quot; behind a big rig?  D rated tires will take out most of the
jumping when a big rig passes you.

&gt; After more than a year of desultory work, we are getting ready to get China
&gt; Cat on the road. She's a 75 Westy.
&gt; 
&gt; The tires that are on her are in good condition, but I question their
&gt; suitability. They are Michelin Radial XH, P205/R15, rated at 695 lbs max load.
&gt; 
&gt; Anyone have experience with these or knowledge as to their ability to carry
&gt; the bus? I've read some posts on the topic, but I don't remember anything
&gt; except that the tire types suggested were far overrated for my 4700 lb 68
&gt; Olds Toronado. I never understood why such heavy duty tires were required,
&gt; unless it has something to do with the height of the bus/Westy.
&gt; 
&gt; If these tires are unsuitable, which I expect is the case, are they safe at
&gt; some maximum speed? Info and &quot;experienced advice&quot; is welcomed.
&gt; 
&gt; Cheers/Don Carron
