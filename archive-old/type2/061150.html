Oh, go for it! The view is so much better than that from an MGB. Seriously, if
you have a good and trusted mechanic-(one who drives a bus themselves is even
better) I believe it is worth it. I paid 500.00 for my '72 Transporter, and
have probably put over $5000.00 into it over the years, with engine rebuilds,
tranny replacements, and other odds and ends. It becomes an addiction, but a
pleasant one. And the belonging to a family aspect has its moments also.
As for practicality, I can haul 12 foot lumber, move antique breakfronts, and
sleep anytime, anyplace I wish to in it. Great all-around vision also. 
Like any older vehicle, it requires loving maintainence to be reliable. This
comes with experience.
