Subject: Subaru --&gt; Type II (y'all pay attn now!)

As a footnote, I'd like to mention that I was lucky to have viewed Mr.
Chamber's Subaru--&gt;VW retrofit at the Arizona Bus Club's Jerome Jamboree in
September. Currently, the retrofit has been engineered into a splitty double
cab. The word &quot;engineered&quot; is appropriate because it apparently has been
well thought out and cleanly executed. The install could easily be described
as &quot;stealth.&quot; I was so impressed that I snapped a fair number of exposures
of this install. Unfortunately, have been too busy and burned-out to have
yet gotten them developed. With Mark's permission, and given time, I would
be happy to plunk them into either my much promised (but yet non-existant)
website or forward them to Mark for his uses. In order to not steal any of
Mark's thunder I will hold my tongue and encourage everyone to pay attention
to this thread.
There is another retrofit in Phoenix that I am aware of that makes use of a
Buick V-6 in a '78 olive green westy. I will see about getting permission to
mention names, take pictures, and provide details as time permits.

The only unusual aspect of these installations that I have to get used to is
the absence of &quot;engine tin.&quot;
