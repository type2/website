Subject: Re: [T2] Cal vs Fed Decel Valve

Bob,

Karl grabbed a decel valve off a junkyard bus for my 79 CAL engine and plunked
it right in without much concern for part numbers, not only did it help kick
down better, but I have since passed Calfornia smog with it.

Does it affect the smog check at all anyway?  I thought it just smoothed out
deceleration.

Billy
M'Boro, TN


&gt; Yesterday I picked up a used decel valve from a 79
&gt; Fed manual tran bus.  Question is will this fed valve work happily
&gt; with my Cal FI system and are there any predictions on my passing
&gt; Cal smog with the fed decel valve installed?
