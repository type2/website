&gt; 2) I've been told that some Canadian folks were making a (small 
&gt; controlled) fire wood under  their engine to warm it up during extreme 
&gt; cold, Is is true ????


I heard that plenty of times,, never seen it.. but I assumed it was for 
Canadians that are alot further north than we are. Were it gets cold.
In fact , this campout was further south than 4 entire states, Montana, 
North Dakota, Minnesota, and of course Alaska.....
and at about the same lat as Roseburg Oregon, Idaho Falls, Shoshoni, Wy, 
Mission SD, Beaver Dam WI, Saganaw MI, Spectacular NY, Rutland VT, Concord 
NH, and Kennebunkport MA. I always have sympathy for those folks in places 
like Green Bay ! Wow,,does it get cold there!

I had an old Mazda pick up that the engine was wearing quickly,, and I had 
increased from 10W30, to straight 50 ,, then started to add 80W90 till it 
was winter, and mostly hypoid oil in the engine ... all to keep the engine 
quiet.
Well,, one cold morning, no amount of battery would turn the engine over... 
shakin my head, I spotted a hibachi in the landlords garage,, I lit the 
bbq,, and slid it under the pan... 20 minutes later.. I was able to start 
it.

so,, I know it isn't an urban legend... some crazy Canuck has done it for 
sure!
