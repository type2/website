Subject: Re: Gas tank size?

&gt;Leave it to the YANKS to ask how many GALLONS their gas tank holds.
&gt;
&gt;According to my owner's manual thus:
&gt;
&gt;56 litres is the fuel Capacity including a 5 litre reserve.

&gt;What happened to all your owner's manuals?

We can't read them. They are in the Metric dialect. We only speak
Provincial. Metric is the barbarous tongue of savages. ;)
