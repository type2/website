Subject: do I have a starting problem?

Hello List!

I'm going to take a 2 week road trip this winter in my '77 Westfalia 2.0 FI.
I believe it to be in great shape.  Heater is hot, and I'm going to install
the thermostat before I leave.  I only have one concern and that is when I
start it it'll die if I push the gas within the first 5+ seconds, after that
it'll rev up fine.  It does this more so when starting it half warmed up
(during lunch).  It starts better, though not perfectly, in the morning.  I
really don't mind the 5+ seconds, but I'm wondering if it's a sign of
something.  A while back Sami Dakhlia asked about the same tendency, figure
anything out Sami?  My timing is right on at idle, but could it have to do
with the time it takes the distributor to set up the idle advance?  Perhaps
if fuel injected folks wrote me describing how their bus starts up we could
come to some conclusions?  Anyone?  Thanks in advance!
