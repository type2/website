&gt; i have a small hole/crack in my spout where the gas cap fits on... my local
&gt; auto store did not have a putty they only had a spray... im sure this
&gt; problem has happened to others.. so if let me know what you have used or
&gt; have heard works....

JB-Weld will work.  I think that it comes in various consistancies.  Clean
the surface with spray carb cleaner (keep it off the paint!) before using
the JB-weld.
