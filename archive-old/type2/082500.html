&gt; &gt; I always shift the cover back and forth with a big screwdriver, then up and
&gt; &gt; down, then make sure it is sitting as far &quot;up&quot; as it can. I think this kind
&gt; &gt; of seats them. I also always use the thick(expensive) cork ones.

&gt; I agree with Brian, and I add ,, 3M adhesive to glue the gasket to the cover
&gt; only,

I use hylomar between the gasket and the cover.  Much easier to clean up
than the 3m stuff, and leaves the valve cover paint unscratched.
