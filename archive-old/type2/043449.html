Karl sends:

&gt; But go westy's are for leaded fuel nozzles. Here in California you cannot
&gt; pass the Smog Check visual if you don't have a fillpipe restricter for
&gt; unleaded nozzles. Yes, I know that all you can buy is unleaded but I guess
&gt; the state of California doesn't.....

The fillpipe restrictor on a lot of cars had a little flap in it to keep the
gas fumes inside the car. This also explains the bellows on the gas pump
nozzles.
