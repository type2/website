Subject: Re: [T2] How much Loctite #518

Loctite 574 is good, almost as good as Curil T, a pretty green paste which 
seals great and removes easily. Unfortunately I suffered through 50 years of 
Permatex and Gaskacinch use before I discovered Curil T. I pay about $8 for 
a tube of Curil T and I think 50 ml of Loctite 574 is about $30 if you can 
find it. Loctite does not market it in the US. I believe some specialty 
places import it from Germany.

 518 is not good for the case halves. It is very good for many other uses,
 for example excellent on the oil pump. But it is far too thick and gooey 
for
 case halves. The best product I have used for case halves is Loctite 574.
 Ask 10 people and you'll get 10 different products as &quot;the best&quot; for case
 halves, but I've used lots of different ones there and 574 is the best for 
a
 few reason. #1 it seals perfectly and flows just right for the application.
 #2 is because it is anaerobic, all the excess just wipes away. It is also
 easy to clean off if you have to open the case later, and sometimes on an
 engine build you make a mistake and need to re-open the case. Many of the
 sealants used for case halves are a real bear to clean off the parting line
 compared to 574 which just scrapes off.
