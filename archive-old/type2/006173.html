Kurt, you know to check that grounding points/cables are clean and
tight...but we recently had an odd one. One of the 2 retaining bolts,
solenoid to starter, had backed out, allowing an inconsistent/poor contact
between the two. Replaced the bolt, tightened all down, and nary a problem
since. You might check for this solenoid &quot;play&quot;.

Regards, Marv Krupp
