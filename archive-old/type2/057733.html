Subject: Electrical weirdness part 2

&gt;This time, after the dummy lights flashed a few times, everything went 
&gt;deader than a door nail and stayed that way.
&gt;
&gt;Last night I Hopped in, turn the key to 'on' and...  the dummy lights
came 
&gt;on, just like normal.  Pushed in the clutch and turned the key to
'start' 
&gt;and the damned thing fired right up!  

Thanks to all who have responded with suggestions on my electrical
problem thus far.  

Well here's another clue for you all;
The walrus was Paul.

Oh.  No, wait!  That's something else entirely.  

The new symptom (and it may have been there all along and I just noticed
it?) is that when the key is in the 'on' position with the engine off
and I turn the key off, the starter apparently engages for just a split
second.  Enough to rock the bus slighty if its in gear and enough to
register very briefly on the tach.  

Faulty ignition switch?  Demonic possesion?

Thanks again.
