Re no title but no rust Westy:
Well, you take your personal rustbucket (talking as a northerrner here) and
remove the dash serial number and ID sticker behind seat.   Switch to no
title bus BODY....if ambitious, remove the engine compartment number (gotta
cut it out) and weld it.   Or grind/repaint the &quot;new bus&quot; serial # off and
play dumb.  nO ONE CHECKS IT HERE.   Repaint the bus as desired.   That's
why one keeps the numbers and clean title off of parted out busses also!!
     If I lived closer I'd be tempted.     MB
