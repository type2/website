Subject: Re: [T2] Help with a picture of the bit below the air cleaner

Hi,

Thanks for the diagram links. I will be using that resource again !

I think I have many bits missing  .......... On diagram :

http://www.ratwell_dot_com/technical/Microfiche/t201600.gif

I have 5(10A) but everything else is missing !

Could anyone advise on where to get such bits.......Also could someone
give me a knee bone connected to thigh bone list for the right hand
side of the diagram bar the air filter (possibly the use of the parts
aswell)? I know I am asking a lot .......

yours

Charles

&gt; From Charles Durrrant:
&gt; I am desperate to get a part  of my engine just right (1974 1800 carb
engine).
&gt;
&gt;  My van went into a garage and they fixed a flap that allows hot air
&gt; into the bit under the air cleaner by putting a screw to stop the flap
&gt; from closing. I'm not too familiar with this but I believe it should
&gt; be done by a vacuum to open the flap to control the air? Can anyone
&gt; help with a description and a photo of the bit with everything intact.
&gt; I don't like misplaced screws etc as there must have been a reason for
&gt; not having the flap always open.....
&gt;
&gt;

&gt;
&gt; The only flap that I know of on a 73/74 dual carb engine is part of the air
cleaner.  #5 here:
&gt; http://www.ratwell_dot_com/technical/Microfiche/t201600.gif
&gt;
&gt; The hot air comes up the right front tin thru #43 and comes out #42 to meet
the bottom of #5 above:
