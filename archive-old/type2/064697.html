Subject: (Fwd) 110v circuit breaker 81' Westy

Anybody replace their breaker in a westy? Mine fried and burnt all 
the wire nuts and insulation on the wires. The fire was contained in 
the junction box so no &quot;real &quot; damage but I can't find that size 
breaker anywhere. Has anybody tried a Ground fault receptacle in the 
place of the breaker, Any reason not to try it??
PS I don't know what fried the breaker, the window AC I had stuck in 
the passenger side window with a custom mount was plugged in a 
extension cord(14 gauge) and on a separate circuit. The damage must 
have been over the last few months and it finally just came apart.
