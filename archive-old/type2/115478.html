Subject: Re: [T2] Stump the experts

That bump is where you put the badge
on brazillian buses, they sell what they 
are using on new buses in brazil.
I would be interested if there is
anywhere that can get ones without
that bump out.  I'd be interested
in getting one.

Is this nose a replacement panel. Why the bump where the logo goes?
