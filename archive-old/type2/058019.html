Subject: RE: Easy Pertronix Install? Hah!

My Ignitor has the module mounted to a round ring that goes around the
dizzy shaft. It's part# 1847A from RMMW. This is fine, excpet by dizzy,
part # 021 905 205 P is a vaccuum advace with the advance arm and
circlip,

&lt;&lt;&lt;The module should fit right in the spot where the points were. Remove
the
points and mount the module on the VA plate. Mine didnt have a round
ring.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;

a black doo hickey (for advance mechanism me thinks) and a grounding
strap.

&lt;&lt;The only black doohickey I remember is the &quot;ferrite doughnut&quot; that
fits over the
shaft. &gt;&gt;

**All** of those prevent the Ignitor ring from sitting flat on the
floor.

&lt;&lt;This must be the doughnut which I had to use the old rotor as a tool
to tap
down on the shaft as it was a tight fit. &gt;&gt;&gt;

  The kit I received came with a elect. module which fit right where the
points were.
Additionally it contained a black ferrite &quot;doughnut&quot; which is lobed. The
module is
set so that it is some specified gap from the high points on the
doughnut.
Sorry I dont remember the gap specifically. Sounds like you got the
wrong kit??
Now it has been a couple of years since I installed this so my
recollection is a bit
fuzzy,,,,,wish I could get a ignitor for the old brain! {:-)
