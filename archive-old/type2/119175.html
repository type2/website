Subject: Paint Color Code Location

Does anyone in T2 land know where to find the paint code(s) for a 73 VW
Standard Bus? Mine is White over Red, but it's being repainted next month
and I can't remember where to find the code.
I know...I bet if I go sit in the spa with a friend and a cool beverage that
I'll remember...I'll try that!
Peace Out,
