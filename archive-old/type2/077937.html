Subject: strange oil leak and flushant

hello all ,
My newly aquired 75 westy is leaking oil from the dipstick tube as if the
back pressure is pushing oil out the tube. It is not overfilled with oil,
someone from the list suggested a holed piston , Whats that? Some one I know
suggested that perhalps some of the galleys are blocked. I dont know the
mileage or history of this motor but it runs quite good and has plenty of
power.  Should I use some of the engine flush and hope for the best? I plan
on removing the exaust to replace gaskets and the seals on the oil filler
tube. anything else I should look for?

thanks in advance
