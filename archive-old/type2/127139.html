Subject: Portland bodyshops???

I need some work done to my sliding door, mainly the metal track on the
bottom.  Anyone have any suggestions for the Portland area.  I'm
looking for someone who cares about getting this to work right, not
just your brothers qwik-n-dirty body shop.

Alabama Pete

PS.  Look for my trip report tomorrow...  2222 miles in eight days...
