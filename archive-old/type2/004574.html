&gt; VW never made a headlight switch 211 941 531. VW could have had a casting
&gt; number for a headlight switch part. The correct switch for a 71 vw bus is
&gt; 211 941 531 E.

Then I have 3 imaginary 211 941 531 PLAIN switches from 71's in my hand!!!!

On the PLAIN switch, the part number is on the black bakelite? surface. On
the E the number is stamped in the case.

Putting a PLAIN switch next to a E switch, there is a BIG difference in the
terminals.  Amount and size.

PLAIN                                                  E
2 - 30                                               2 - 30
1 - 56                                               1 - 56
1 - 57                                               NO 57
1 - 58                                               1 - 58
1 - 58b                                             1 - 58b
NO 58L                                            1 - 58L
NO 58R                                            1 - 58R
1 - X                                                  1 - X

Looking at the Bentley and comparing wiring diagrams for 71 and 74 to
79..... the E [late bay] uses 5 of the 8 terminals, 58L + R are not used.
[circuit 30 is a double terminal but only 1 is used on both switches] The
PLAIN [71] uses 6 of the 7 terminals. The E does NOT have terminal 57 for
the indicator light on the dash for parking lights. On the PLAIN switch, all
the terminals are 1/4'' male spade. On the E, terminal 58b is 1/8'' male
spade.

If anyone wants me to mail them a non-existant PLAIN switch and a E switch
to see for themselves that there is a difference, let me know. The PLAIN
switches have bad dashlight rheostats......so don't expect a good one:))

I would take digital pics of them but my camera doesn't do close-ups very
well.
