Subject: Lubricant on Seat Rails

I am in the process of stripping out my van for a full resto.  While cleaning
the seats, rails and passenger &quot;turntable&quot; I noticed that it all seemed to be
lubricated with a substance similar to beeswax, but not quite as sticky.  What
is it?

Nuts to the rust Bullet on the West Coast,  but hey, I waited this long,
another month or two isn't going to make a whole lot of difference.  There is
still lots to do before that stage.

Katherine
