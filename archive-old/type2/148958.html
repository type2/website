Subject: 15&quot; Wheels in front, 14&quot; in Rear

Okay volks...now that Konrad the Tiki Bus has a fresh motor and a whole 
lot of other love thrown at him, we noticed something interesting today 
when we had it up on the lift (I married well...my father-in-law has a 
full freakin' Rotary Lift in his #3 garage).

The P/O had the disc brake conversion done on the bus (a '69 Westy), 
and lo and behold, the front wheels are 15-inch. The rear, however, are 
14-inch.

Anyone had any thoughts on why?

It looked like the 14-inch wheels up front would not have allowed for 
clearance inside the rim for all the disc brake stuff, from what we 
could see.

Big question is...WILL 14-inch wheels up front work? Or should we go 
ahead and get 15-inch wheels for the rear, and deal with that sort of 
setup?

Your thoughts are always welcome!
