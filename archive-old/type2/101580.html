Subject: Calif. &amp; Ariz. Emissions Laws - What's the latest?

&gt;Before everyone in Calif runs out and takes off the air &gt;injection and EGR off their 74 buses:  All
&gt;you are exempt from is the biennial inspection. Legally, &gt;all 66 to 74 vehicles must still remain
&gt;untampered!

Then uncle Karl told Vdub horror stories around the campfire all night till I got so scared I crushed my bus!

Seriously though, this is going to be a big challenge to the California VW crowd. I see a lot of VW's leaving california by way of samba/ebarf or the crusher. 

Unfortunato, but whaddya gonna do? The Sierra Nevada are 12,000 feet tall, I live at 300ft elevation 12 miles away from them and I can't see them all summer.

I for one am torn.

I'm looking guiltily at my bus, and riding the bike more these days.
