Hi, 
I just bought a breakerless points system called &quot;MagFire&quot;. The FLAPS was
out of Pertronix and since I was there anyway I bought it. Before I install
it I want some feedback if any is available. Has anyone had any experience
with this product?  If it has a bad reputation I will bring it back. 
Bob
