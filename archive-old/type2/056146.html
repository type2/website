Hi,

I'm new to this list but have been on the vintagevw for some time. I'm doing a body off on a 71 type I with a '70 up next. I just found a type II '69 non-popup (campmobile?, station wagon?) in arkansas and need to tow it back to Memphis. Didn't see too much in the archives on towbars. Has anyone ever made a bus tow bar? I'd like to make one so I'd have it but will trailer if need be. Engine is inside, trans still in. Thoughts? Help!
