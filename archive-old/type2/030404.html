Subject: It runs! (sort of) Thanks and corrections

Well, it ran :-)  After a week of hairpulling, this alone is cause for
celebration! It is not running right, but I think that I cured the
original problem, which was no ground to the ECU.  For all you out there
collecting FI trouble shooting tips, the symptom was that it would start
for a second, then die.  Much like a vacuum pipe off, but depressing the
gas did not help and the run before dying was shorter (2-3 rotations,
rather than a second)  The diagnostic was no continuity between ground and
ECU plug terminals #5, 15, and 17.  The cure was to remove the ground
block from under the #3 intake manifold runner and clean it and the three
wires that ran to it until they were shiny and bright.

Thanks to Steve Blackham, Karl von Salzen, and Al brase for their good
advice!

Corrections:

First, the terminals on the ECU Plug are 5, 15, and 17. (Tho this is kind
of meaningless, there was no relation between pin # and position on my
plug, just be sure that there are three terminals with continuity to
ground, eh?)
Second, the quality of the EGA tester is high, but the case is plastic,
not metal as I said (must be those flashbacks they promised me :)

And lastly, the problems are not over :-(  It does run, but the fuel pump
now starts when the key is in the on position and continues to run until
the key is off.  *Something* is wrong in the double relay!  Also, the idle
is not stable, but on a positive note, it is way down from the 2500 RPM
that it was doing before this occurred.

The real problem, on my bus and also Roger's problem (earlier today with
his dual solex problem) is that not only must all the systems work, they
must all work *at the same time* :-)
